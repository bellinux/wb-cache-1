40|$|During July 1970, {{albacore}} boats trolling surface jigs (jig boats) had record {{catches in}} an area off {{the mouth of the}} Columbia River. The jig fishery declined suddenly in late July and was poor throughout the remainder of the summer. No obvious oceanographic changes were correlated with these drastic changes in fishing success. Favorable water temperatures extended through August, traditionally the month of highest albacore landings in Oregon. <b>Bait</b> <b>boats,</b> which chum with live bait, had good fishing off Oregon from mid-August to October, indicating that the poor success of jig boats during this time was caused by the behavior of albacore relative to surface-trolled fishing gear. It is postulated that albacore descended into subsurface water in response to a change in availability of their preferred prey, the saury; here they were less accessible to jig <b>boats</b> than <b>bait</b> <b>boats.</b> Saury were common in the stomachs of albacore during periods of good jig fishing and were usually the dominant food where high albacore catches were made by our research vessel. The first albacore catches of the season were probably from an area of warm temperature and low salinity representing Columbia River plume water. The subsequent migration to the north appeared to be along the oceanic edge of the plume.

40|$|Tunas {{and related}} species are {{considered}} Highly Migratory Pelagic animals (HMP) {{with a high}} fisheries interest and an important commercial value. Many authors have highlighted the effect of climatic oscillation such as NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) and AO (Arctic Oscillation) on HMP. In this paper we analyzed the differential effect of these oscillations on three HMP: albacore (Thunnus alalunga), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Fisheries data for the Spanish fleet from North Atlantic area were obtained from International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Data since 1950 for albacore, 1962 for yellowfin tuna and 1950 for swordfish, from different gears: troll (TROL), purse seine (PS), longline (LL) and <b>bait</b> <b>boat</b> (BB) were analyzed. We used the nonparametric test U Mann Whitney to test the relationships between species, gear and oscillation phases (positive or negative) of NAO and AO. Our {{results indicated that the}} landings of albacore caught with TROL increased with the positive phase of AO and AOw. The landing of swordfish caught with LL in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea significantly increased with the positive phase of AO, AOw, and NAOw. Finally, the landing of yellowfin tuna caught with PS in the East Atlantic increased significantly with the positive phase of NAOw, and LL landing increased with the negative phase of NAOw. The inclusion of the climate effects on the standardization of abundance indexes used in the assessment of HMP could improve its results and catch projections. Postprin...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth rate}} of a fish is a {{fundamental}} component used in stock assessments to help determine the population size and the fishery pressure affecting the species. There has been recent debate within the stock assessment community regarding which type of growth model best represents the true {{growth rate of}} yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in the Atlantic Ocean; specifically, whether assessments done by the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) should use a traditional von Bertalaffy growth curve or a so-called “two-stanza” growth curve, which has one growth rate for smaller individual tuna and another for larger sizes. Currently, ICCAT uses an age-structured virtual population analysis (VPA) for the stock assessment and assumes a two-stanza growth curve. Using a simulated population based on known biological parameters obtained by ICCAT from the stock in the Atlantic Ocean, and the Stock Synthesis 3 program available through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the simulated yellowfin tuna population is compared within each model {{in order to determine}} the merits of each growth rate assumption. In addition, gear selectivity during fishing operations often affects the length composition data from fisheries dependent sources, namely commercial fishermen. The simulated population is therefore also used to determine the effects of different gear selectivity on the growth rates within each of the growth models.

40|$|The {{following}} {{paper has}} been compiled as {{an answer to}} the innumerable questions constantly asked by an interested public about the tuna fishery. Whereas the tunas of this coast are now the object of a biological study by the California State Fisheries Laboratory, this paper is in no sense a contribution to this study. It is merely a limited description of the fishery and the boats engaged therein. It is limited because it covers only one — the most important, the most interesting and most spectacular — branch of the tuna fishery, namely the high seas live bait fishery for skipjack and yellowfin tuna. Both these species are also caught by purse seine boats and by small live <b>bait</b> <b>boats</b> fishing in local waters, but their catches are minor and erratic. It is the steady deliveries of the larger <b>bait</b> <b>boats</b> throughout the year upon which the industry depends. In actual value of the product, tuna is second only to salmon on the entire Pacific coast. In tonnage landed, it ranks second in the fisheries of California. In 1936 the total pack of tuna approximated 2, 600, 000 cases. Virtually the entire catch of these two species is canned in southern California, with San Diego and San Pedro as the home ports of the fleet. Negligible quantities are sold to a limited fresh fish trade. There are five so-called tunas taken in California and each supports a fleet of more or less specialized boats which contribute to California's tuna pack. Descriptions of these fisheries may be found elsewhere, but the present account pertains exclusively to the live bait, hook and line fishery for yellowfin and skipjack followed by the larger boats. The tuna fleet comprises about 70 boats, built at a cost approaching $ 6, 000, 000. According {{to the size of the}} individual vessel, this fleet may be divided arbitrarily into two parts. Those under 90 feet are herein referred to as the "smaller tuna boats" and these will be discussed only incidentally. Those over 90 feet are designated as the "larger tuna boats," and the 50 vessels comprising this fleet are essentially the subject of this article. All statements and descriptions apply therefore to a representative average of this fleet. These tuna boats are the largest fishing vessels registered in this state and they were expressly designed and built to exploit the most extended fishery on this coast. On a single trip of perhaps seven or eight weeks they may travel a total distance of 6000 to 8000 miles and range 3000 miles from home. Necessarily, they are large for they must accommodate sufficient fuel capacity, a refrigerated fish hold that will carry a paying load, and a crew large enough to catch it. Their fuel capacity ranges from 10, 000 to 30, 000 gallons; their fish capacity from 150 to 350 tons; and the size of crew from 12 to 20 men, according to the size of the vessel. Almost any day at San Diego one of these tuna boats may be seen preparing for a trip. With all repairs completed, she proceeds to the fuel docks where the tanks are filled with diesel and lubricating oil. From here she proceeds to the icing dock. Three-hundred-pound blocks of ice are transferred from the waiting trucks to the conveyor and carried by this to the crusher overhead, from which they pour in an endless stream of fine particles to the blower beneath. This blower is used to distribute the ice uniformly to the farthest corners of the hold, thus eliminating much unnecessary shovelling. Meanwhile, loads of provisions and miscellaneous stores come aboard and the erstwhile trim tuna boat now takes on a dishevelled look of chaos, with crates and bales and boxes piled everywhere. Late in the afternoon order is restored and the vessel is deserted except for one or two who keep the engine watch, for with the taking on of ice an auxiliary is started to run the refrigerating plant and bait pumps, and one or the other auxiliary runs continuously for the duration of the trip. The sailing time is set and the remainder of the crew has gone ashore to spend the intervening time at home. Later in the evening the tuna boat will sail. With three long blasts on the whistle, a last farewell to the families and friends ashore, she heads for sea. The long trip has begun...|$|R

40|$|I am steadfast {{against any}} change {{at this time}} for {{recreational}} fisherman. First and foremost {{we need to know}} how many anglers targeting red snapper there really are. In my opinion there is dire need for a red snapper tag or stamp to be issued with a state fishing license or available at sporting goods, bait camps, marinas, or some readily available source and most anglers {{would be willing to pay}} a reasonable fee for it. Then and only then can we get a real number of anglers targeting red snapper. With that you would have the information to gather your catch information as you could get addresses, phone numbers, email or other contact for the real snapper anglers. From this you could do creel surveys at the marinas, <b>bait</b> camps, <b>boat</b> ramps, or do phone email surveys. This is how we get real numbers and not some imaginary ghost numbers that are far from the facts. This would be real factual information to have a much better assessment of the fishery. This could also be the building blocks for other species as well. I myself know many people that buy a Texas fishing license and a state saltwater stamp that have never been red snapper fishing and never will fish for red snapper. We can’t just throw some unknown number out there and assume that a large percentage of the license bearers are snapper fishing or get anywhere of the real number of red snapper angler. There are bay fishermen that never go offshore. There are offshore fishermen that never target red snapper. To just give a natural resource as important as our red snapper t...|$|R

Captain Dan wanted to try to get the kite up, but I objected on the score that if we could fly it at all it would only be to drag a <b>bait</b> behind the <b>boat.</b> That would necessitate running through the schools of tuna, and as I believed this would put them down, I wanted to wait for enough wind to drag a bait at right angles with the boat. This is the proper procedure, because it enables an angler to place his bait over a school of tuna at a hundred yards or more from the boat. It certainly is the most beautiful and thrilling way to get a strike.|$|R

50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{gasoline}} motors, winter trolling has become a common practice, and provides fresh fish in the cold months that traditionally depended on stored fish. Trolling poles {{are similar to those}} used in sport fishing, but are much heavier and stronger with correspondingly heavier tackle and longer lines. They are set in the stern and along the side gunwales of a <b>boat,</b> <b>baited</b> or strung with flashing spoons or spinners. The boat then slowly motors around areas where salmon, usually kings, are known to school during the winter, aided by ultrasonic fish-finders. Periodically the lines are checked and brought in to remove fish. The same techniques are used for halibut as well. The harvest by this method is fairly small as it depends more on luck; salmon are not guaranteed to bite at lures and bait, unlike the certainty in catching them while spawning. Because of this limited take, trolling is usually avoided during spawning season and only used to bring home fresh fish in the winter. Trolling is often a family event done on the weekends, and often includes overnights on board. Because of the relative inactivity in trolling, the poles are not always well minded. This occasionally results in seals or sea lions snatching hooked fish still on the line and making off with them, causing much consternation and fun stories to tell later.|$|R
40|$|The Working Group on Southern Horse Mackerel, Anchovy and Sardine (WGHANSA), met at Bilbao (Spain), 21 – 26 June 2013, {{chaired by}} Andrés Uriarte. There were 11 {{participants}} from France, Portugal and Spain (one attending on line). The main {{task was to}} assess the status and to provide short term predictions for the stocks of Anchovy in Subarea VIII and in Division IXa, for Sardine in Divisions VIIIc and IXa, and in Divisions VIIIab and subarea VII, and for horse mackerel (T. trachurus) in Division IXa and Jack Marckerel (T. pictoratus) in X (Azores). Most assessments were updated assessments according to the stock annexes, except Jack mackerel in Azores which has a biennial advice. The Anchovy in Subarea VIII was estimated to be at 56 055 t in May 2013 (within a range 36 220 – 88 925 t), well above Blim, according to the Bayesian modelling of the population. This SSB is perceived to be about 31 % below the 2012 level; Nevertheless the later has been revised upward by 19 % as compared with last year assessment. As usual two spring surveys were used as inputs for the Bayesian assessment of the population. After a strong discrepancy of their estimates in 2012, the 2013 estimates of biomass provided by the spring surveys were closer though not coincident (65 909 t the DEPM and 93 854 the acoustic). The decrease in biomass between 2012 and 2013 is related to the relative agreement of both surveys in pointing out that the percentage of age 1 in mass was less than for ages 2 and older, as this imply not a sufficient regeneration of the population in 2013 as to maintain the 2012 biomass. Catch options were provided on the basis of undetermined recruitment in 2014. As in previous years, the WG collected the available data on the fisheries of anchovy in northern areas (Subareas VI, VII and IV), although no assessment is so far required for the anchovy in those regions. Anchovy in Division IXa, demands separate analysis and advice for the western Iberian Atlantic coasts (i. e. Subdivisions IXa North, Central- North and Central-South) from the southern regions (Algarve and Gulf of Cadiz, i. e. Subdivision IXa South), due to the independent dynamics and genetic differentiation of the populations in these regions. This a data poor stock category for which trend based assessment from surveys is provided. In the western areas catches are generally low, in rare occasion exceeding a thousand tonnes (as in 1995 / 96). In 2011, after several years of almost null detections, the acoustic PELAGO+PELACUS surveys estimated a Biomass of 27, 000 t, in that area, and catches rose up to 3780 t. However in 2013, these surveys estimated a sharp reduction of biomass to rather low normal levels (around 4284 t). This confirms that the outburst episodes of biomass are not sustainable in this North-western region of IXa. In the Subdivision IXa South, where the bulk of the population is usually concentrated and supports a rather stable fishery, the 2013 biomass index from the acoustic PELAGO survey is 49 % below the median historic survey results. This estimate was supported by a Spanish recruitment survey in the autumn of 2012 which pointed out to a recruitment value below average too. However neither the fishery nor the population indexes (assessed by surveys) show any long trend for the anchovy in IXa south. Exploratory evaluations of current harvest rates in the context of Yield per recruit analysis suggest that current exploitation levels in the IXa seem sustainable. Exploration of length-based reference points also supported this view. There is no information on recruitment that will form the bulk of the catches in the following year. For the Iberian Sardine, after a gap in survey inputs in 2012, new acoustic surveys in the spring 2013 (PELAGO+PELACUS) allowed an updated analytic assessment of the population. These surveys recorded the lowest historical biomass levels, but at rather similar values as their former estimates of 2011. As such, the assessment based on the Stock Synthesis pointed to a pronounced decline of biomass since 2006 {{due to the lack of}} any strong recruitment since 2005. Current biomass of about 192 000 t in 2013, would be around historical minimum, being in 2012 around 64 % below the long-term average, while fishing mortality seems to be around the historical average, fluctuating without a clear trend. The stock is expected to decline unless a new strong year class appears. Catch options assuming another low recruitment as in recent years (2008 – 2012) were provided. The WG was assessed by the first time the Sardine in Divisions VIIIa,b,d and Subarea VII, by analysing survey trends according to the benchmark carried out in February 2013 (WKPELA). Surveys, restricted to subarea VIII (acoustic –Pelgas- and eggs – Bioman- surveys), show no neat trend in biomass indexes since 2000, though marked fluctuations are recorded. The last big cycle peaked in 2009 - 2010. Following years were lower but in the middle of the range of biomass for the period 2000 - 201. Pelgas survey pointed to the highest recruitment in 2013 in subarea VIII. Catch curve analysis on survey and commercial fleets suggest fishing mortality slightly lower than natural mortality, i. e. seemingly sustainable. There is little information from subarea VII: no survey index is available and catches are not monitored for biological sampling, so little can be done in terms of assessing the population and the fishery in this subarea, except assuming trends would be similar to subarea VIII. There is no international TAC for these fisheries. Catch are mainly taken by France and Spain in VIIIa,b,d and by France, Netherlands and United Kingdom in VII. For the southern Horse mackerel (Division IXa) a new analytical assessment was carried out following the stock annex, with catches up to 2012 and surveys up to 2011 (as the 2012 survey could not take place). The fishery is shared between Portugal and Spain. The estimated SSB shows some decrease since 2007 but with a wide confidence interval (being estimated around 30 % below the long term average). The fishing mortality shows a significant decrease in last two years. Recruitment is estimated to be above average in 2011. No precautionary reference points have been defined for this stock. F 35 %SPR (0. 11) is proposed as a proxy for FMSY. Historical fishing mortalities have on average (0. 09) been at or below the candidate FMSY (though actual estimates are very uncertain). Catch options were provided under the assumption of historical geometric mean recruitment. For the Jack mackerel (Trachurus picturatus) in the waters of the Azores, though the 2012 advice is biennial and valid for 2013 and 2014, the WG continue the collation of data along with some exploratory analysis of that information. The analysis is based on commercial abundance indices from the main fleets, used as an indicator of stock trends. It was noted that catches in 2012 reduced compared to previous years: According to the length and age composition of catches from the purse seine fishery, which target juveniles, this was probably due to a failure of recruits at age 1 in 2012. Although the tuna baitboats do not show a sharp de-crease in cpue as the purse seine fleet for 2012, this could be explained since the <b>bait</b> <b>boats</b> also catch <b>bait</b> offshore when jack mackerel is not available in the coast. As occasional fluctuations of 1 or 2 years have also happened in the past this was not considered to suppose a major warning on the status of the stock or for the fishery. In addition the WG was asked to report on the advance of the preparation of the benchmarking for Anchovy in Subarea IXa; the WG recommended to delay the benchmarking to 2015, basically due to limited man power and to allow for the new DEPM 2014 survey to be examined by WGACEGGs in Nov 2014 and serve as a new input the Benchmark. Finally the WG proposes in Annex 4 specific actions to be taken to improve the quality and transmission of the data (including improvements in data collection and potential inputs from RACs), as requested to the group...|$|R
