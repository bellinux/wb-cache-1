60|$|The Captain {{had spread}} the cloth with great care, and was making some egg-sauce {{in a little}} saucepan: basting the fowl {{from time to time}} during the process with a strong interest, as it turned and <b>browned</b> <b>on</b> a string before the fire. Having propped Florence up with {{cushions}} on the sofa, which was already wheeled into a warm corner for her greater comfort, the Captain pursued his cooking with extraordinary skill, making hot gravy in a second little saucepan, boiling a handful of potatoes in a third, never forgetting the egg-sauce in the first, and making an impartial round of basting and stirring with the most useful of spoons every minute. Besides these cares, the Captain had to keep his eye on a diminutive frying-pan, in which some sausages were hissing and bubbling in a most musical manner; and there was never such a radiant cook as the Captain looked, in the height and heat of these functions: it being impossible to say whether his face or his glazed hat shone the brighter.|$|E

50|$|In the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, a {{casserole}} {{is named after}} its dish, rather than its contents. Casseroles in these countries {{are very similar to}} stews. The difference is that once the meat and vegetables are <b>browned</b> <b>on</b> top of the stove, they are then cooked in liquid in the oven in a closed dish, producing meat that is tender and juicy, from long slow cooking. The heat is indirect, so there is less chance of burning.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{version of}} the dish uses a Spanish culinary practice of threading strips of pork back-fat through thick pieces of cheaper lean beef to render them tender. The larded pieces of beef are then marinated in vinegar, soy sauce, calamansi juice, crushed garlic, black pepper, bay leaf, and fish sauce (added later in the process). They are then quickly <b>browned</b> <b>on</b> all sides in hot oil or lard, and then slowly braised in the marinade {{with the addition of}} soup stock, onion slices, and tomato sauce until tender and the liquid is reduced to a thick gravy.|$|E
50|$|Take a young chicken, {{remove the}} neck and legs, and cut into large pieces at the joints. Sauté in 30 grams (about 1 ounce) of butter and one {{tablespoon}} of olive oil, seasoning with salt, pepper, {{and a dash of}} nutmeg. When the pieces have <b>browned</b> <b>on</b> both sides, skim the fat and add a level tablespoon of flour and a deciliter (about 7 fluid ounces) of wine. Add broth and cover, cooking over low heat until done. Before removing from the fire, garnish with a pinch of chopped parsley; arrange on a serving dish and squeeze half a lemon over it. The result is an appetizing dish.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{something}} wrong with elm trees. In {{the early part of this}} summer, not long after the leaves were fairly out upon them, here and there a branch appeared as if it had been touched with red-hot iron and burnt up, all the leaves withered and <b>browned</b> <b>on</b> the boughs. First one tree was thus affected, then another, then a third, till, looking round the fields, it seemed as if every fourth or fifth tree had thus been burnt. ... Upon mentioning this I found that it had been noticed in elm avenues and groups a hundred miles distant, so that it is not a local circumstance.|$|E
5000|$|Made {{with basic}} {{ingredients}} (bread, butter, and cheese) and heated, cheese dreams {{are said to}} have originated as [...] "the cheese dream" [...] during the Great Depression, as [...] "an inexpensive company supper dish" [...] and an inexpensive option for feeding friends and family at Sunday supper. Additions of sliced tomatoes, ham, and bacon could be used, and they were often accompanied by olives and pickles. A 1932 San Jose News story, [...] "Cheese Dream New Favorite Sandwich," [...] suggested sprinkling the cheese [...] "very sparingly" [...] with a bit of mustard, cayenne, [...] "and a little minced red sweet pepper"; the sandwich was <b>browned</b> <b>on</b> both sides and served with [...] "very hot, rich tomato sauce." [...] The sandwiches may predate the Depression, however, as a 1918 Good Housekeeping issue mentions Cheese Dreams as a luncheon dish, [...] "our teahouse friend." ...|$|E
40|$|Randomness is everywhere. Do {{you like}} to cook? Imagine you’re sauteeing some onions. You’d like each slice of onion to be equally <b>browned</b> <b>on</b> both sides. However, you don’t measure this for each piece. Instead, you stir randomly, and by the “law of large numbers, ” this occurs naturally. The law of large numbers says that if we flip a fair coin many times, {{about half the time}} it will come up heads and half tails. Of course, we expect some error: heads may appear 53 % of the time, for example. We call this 3 % {{difference}} from the expected 50 % the error. The error gets smaller the more times we flip the coin, becoming negligible for a large number of flips. We all pay attention to polls before elections. Surprisingly, a modest sample of 400 random people can predict percentages of the whole United States to within 5 % (with 95 % certainty). 1 This idea is called random sampling. Random sampling relies on the law of large numbers. To see this, suppose 57 % of the population supports Obama. Asking a random person whether they support Obama is the same as flipping a biased coin, which comes up “yes ” 57 % of the time and “no ” 43 % of the time. By the law of large numbers, the more people we ask, the smaller the error. Note that this argument doesn’t depend {{on the size of the}} population; the error would be the same regardless of the population of the United States. Want to make money? It’s commonly assumed that the price of a stock follows a “random walk. ” That is, each day the price change corresponds to a random coi...|$|E
