5|$|The <b>Big</b> <b>Star</b> discography drew renewed {{attention}} in the 1980s when R.E.M., and the Replacements {{as well as other}} popular bands cited the group as an influence. In 1992, interest was further stimulated by Rykodisc's reissues of the band's albums, complemented by a collection of Bell's solo work. In 1993, Chilton and Stephens reformed <b>Big</b> <b>Star</b> with recruits Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow of the Posies, and gave a concert at the University of Missouri. The band remained active, performing tours in Europe and Japan, and released a new studio album, In Space, in 2005. Chilton died in 2010 after suffering from heart problems. Hummel died of cancer three months later. These deaths left Stephens as the sole surviving founding member. <b>Big</b> <b>Star</b> was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2014.|$|E
5|$|As the 1960s {{came to a}} close, folk rock {{changed and}} evolved away from the jangly {{template}} pioneered by The Byrds, but, Unterberger argues, the band's influence could still {{be heard in the}} music of Fairport Convention. Since the 1960s, The Byrds' jangly, folk rock sound has continued to influence popular music up to the present day, with authors Chris Smith, Johnny Rogan, Mark Deming, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine all noting the band's influence on such acts as <b>Big</b> <b>Star,</b> Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, R.E.M., The Long Ryders, The Smiths, The Bangles, The Stone Roses, Teenage Fanclub, and The La's.|$|E

5|$|Big Star's first album—1972's #1 Record—was met by {{enthusiastic}} reviews, but ineffective marketing by Stax Records {{and limited}} distribution stunted its commercial success. Frustration {{took its toll}} on band relations: Bell left {{not long after the}} first record's commercial progress stalled, and Hummel left to finish his college education after a second album, Radio City, was completed in December 1973. Like #1Record, Radio City received excellent reviews, but label issues again thwarted sales—Columbia Records, which had assumed control of the Stax catalog, likewise effectively vetoed its distribution. After a third album, recorded in the Fall of 1974, was deemed commercially unviable and shelved before receiving a title, the band broke up late in 1974. Four years later, the first two <b>Big</b> <b>Star</b> LPs were released together in the UK as a double album. The band's third album was finally issued soon afterward; titled Third/Sister Lovers, it found limited commercial success. Shortly thereafter, Chris Bell was {{killed in a car accident}} at the age of 27.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Big</b> <b>Star's</b> Third {{refers to}} a series of tribute concerts built on <b>Big</b> <b>Star's</b> 1975 album Third/Sister Lovers. Regarded as a [...] "lost masterpiece," [...] and {{described}} as [...] "the soundtrack to a nervous breakdown," [...] the material from Third/Sister Lovers was first played live and fully orchestrated in December 2010, when two dozen musicians performed it at the Cat's Cradle in Carrboro, North Carolina. Since then, <b>Big</b> <b>Star's</b> Third concerts have taken place in the United States, the UK, and Australia.Although the performers rotate from show to show, a core group of musicians, including Jody Stephens, <b>Big</b> <b>Star's</b> original drummer, Mike Mills of R.E.M., Chris Stamey from The dB's, and Mitch Easter of Let's Active {{have been involved in the}} majority of the <b>Big</b> <b>Star's</b> Third shows.|$|R
50|$|Since 2010, Mills {{has played}} with a {{rotating}} group of musicians {{for a series of}} concerts built around <b>Big</b> <b>Star's</b> seminal album, Third/Sister Lovers. Known as <b>Big</b> <b>Star's</b> Third, the concerts have taken place in London, Sydney, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles, and New York.|$|R

5|$|Since quitting {{the band}} in 1972, Bell had {{spent time in}} several {{different}} countries trying to develop his solo career. In 1978, after his return to Memphis, the first two <b>Big</b> <b>Star</b> albums were released together in the UK as a double album, drawing enthusiastic reviews and interest from fans. Soon afterwards Big Star's recognition grew further when, four years after its completion, the third album too was released in both the US and the UK. By now, the hitherto untitled Third/Sister Lovers had become known by several unofficial names including Third (reflecting {{its position in the}} discography), Beale Street Green (acknowledging the legendary site nearby, once a focal point for Memphis blues musicians) and Sister Lovers (because during the album's recording sessions, Chilton and Stephens were dating sisters Lesa and Holliday Aldridge).|$|E
5|$|The {{frustration}} at #1 Records obstructed sales contributed to tension within the band. There was physical fighting between members: Bell, after being {{punched in the}} face by Hummel, retaliated by smashing Hummel's new bass guitar to pieces against the wall. Hummel took revenge at a later date: finding Bell's acoustic guitar in the latter's unattended car, he repeatedly punched it with a screwdriver. In November 1972, Bell quit the band. When work continued on songs for a second album, Bell rejoined, but further conflict soon erupted. A master tape of the new songs inexplicably went missing, and Bell, whose heavy drug intake was affecting his judgment, attacked Fry's parked car. In late 1972, struggling with severe depression, Bell quit the band once more, {{and by the end}} of the year <b>Big</b> <b>Star</b> disbanded.|$|E
25|$|Chilton {{reformed}} <b>Big</b> <b>Star</b> in 1993 with {{a lineup}} that included {{two members of}} The Posies, Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow. From then on, he added to his schedule concerts and recordings with the new version of <b>Big</b> <b>Star.</b> The final <b>Big</b> <b>Star</b> studio album, entitled In Space, with songs penned by the then-current lineup, was released by Rykodisc on September 27, 2005.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Cable Visions: Television Beyond Broadcasting", The Rock was {{described}} as [...] "for a long time, the WWE's <b>biggest</b> <b>star</b> and probably held the greatest international appeal".

25|$|He {{had been}} {{scheduled}} to play a concert with <b>Big</b> <b>Star</b> at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas, on March 20; the show instead took place as a tribute to Chilton, with guests Curt Kirkwood, Chris Stamey, M. Ward, Mike Mills, John Doe, Sondre Lerche, Chuck Prophet, Evan Dando, The Watson Twins, and original member Andy Hummel (who died three months later) joining the other members of <b>Big</b> <b>Star.</b>|$|E
25|$|The group later {{known as}} <b>Big</b> <b>Star</b> stemmed from two Bell band {{projects}} {{that began in}} the late 1960s while he recorded and performed live in groups named Icewater and Rock City. These groups featured a revolving set of musicians including Jody Stephens, Terry Manning, Tom Eubanks, Andy Hummel, Richard Rosebrough, Vance Alexander, and Steve Rhea. Recordings by these groups appear on the various artists collection Rockin' Memphis 1960's–1970's Vol. 1, Rock City (2003), and Looking Forward: The Roots of <b>Big</b> <b>Star</b> (2017).|$|E

25|$|Along with Ardent Studios founder John Fry and {{engineer}} Terry Manning, Bell {{is credited}} {{with much of the}} mixing and engineering work done on the first <b>Big</b> <b>Star</b> album, #1 Record. After this album failed to achieve commercial success (partially due to confusion by its soul-oriented distributor Stax in marketing the album), Bell left the band in 1972. He struggled with depression {{for the rest of his}} life. He also dealt with drug and alcohol problems while also becoming deeply immersed in Christianity. According to his brother David, Bell may have left <b>Big</b> <b>Star</b> due to a belief that he was overshadowed by the more famous Chilton.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} 2017, Bell's {{life will be}} {{documented}} in the book There Was a Light: The Cosmic History of Chris Bell and the Rise of <b>Big</b> <b>Star.</b> The oral-history style bio is slated for a November 2017 release.|$|E
