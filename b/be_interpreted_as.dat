5000|$|Some plants do {{not produce}} sporophylls. Sporangia are {{produced}} directly on stems. Psilotum has <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> producing sporangia (fused in a synangium) on the terminus of a stem.

The sporangia, despite being recurved <b>are</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> terminal.|$|R
5|$|Non-Ediacarans : Some Ediacaran organisms {{have more}} complex details preserved, which has {{allowed them to}} <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> {{possible}} early forms of living phyla excluding them from some definitions of the Ediacaran biota.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the change}} in {{designated}} values relative to the WHERE clause, from a logic perspective the law of excluded middle is a tautology for CHECK constraints, meaning CHECK (p OR NOT p) always succeeds. Furthermore, assuming Nulls are to <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> existing but unknown values, some pathological CHECKs like the one above allow insertion of Nulls that could never be replaced by any non-null value.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 DCIEM (Defence and Civil Institution of Environmental Medicine, Canada) {{released}} No-Decompression and Decompression Tables {{based on}} the Kidd/Stubbs serial compartment model and extensive ultrasonic testing, and Edward D. Thalmann published the USN E-L algorithm and tables for constant PO2 Nitrox closed circuit rebreather applications, and extended use of the E-L model for constant PO2 Heliox CCR in 1985. The E-L model may <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> a bubble model.|$|E
50|$|The {{stratified}} shungite-bearing deposits that retain sedimentary structures <b>are</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> metamorphosed oil source rocks. Some diapiric mushroom-shaped structures {{have been}} identified, which <b>are</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> possible mud volcanoes. Layer and vein shungite varieties, and shungite filling vesicles and forming the matrix to breccias, <b>are</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> migrated petroleum, {{now in the}} form of metamorphosed bitumen.|$|R

50|$|Paper {{wealth is}} {{attributed}} {{as being a}} factor in economic cycles; in mainstream economics this <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> the wealth effect, while in some heterodox schools it <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> price bubbles.|$|R
5|$|In {{his book}} A New Kind of Science, Stephen Wolfram {{points out that}} rule 184, when run on {{patterns}} with density 50%, can <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> parsing the context free language describing strings formed from nested parentheses. This interpretation {{is closely related to}} the ballistic annihilation view of rule 184: in Wolfram's interpretation, an open parenthesis corresponds to a left-moving particle while a close parenthesis corresponds to a right-moving particle.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-11 and its planets were {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars. These dips in brightness can <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> planets whose orbits move {{in front of}} their stars from the perspective of Earth. Kepler-11 is the first discovered exoplanetary system with more than three transiting planets.|$|E
5|$|On this basis, Michael Stifel {{has been}} {{credited}} with publishing the first known table of binary logarithms in 1544. His book Arithmetica Integra contains several tables that show the integers with their corresponding powers of two. Reversing the rows of these tables allow them to <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> tables of binary logarithms.|$|E

5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} {{may also}} <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> the conformal {{image of a}} spherical triangle with 120° angles.

5|$|The album embraces {{a form of}} {{symbolism}} {{that would}} eventually become a staple of Morrison's songs, equating earthly love and heaven, or as close as a living being can approach it. Morrison and Davis's upright bass can <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> the earth opposing Kay's percussion and the string arrangement representing heaven and with Berliner's lead acoustic guitar residing on a plane in between.|$|E

50|$|In DXT2, {{the color}} data <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> being premultiplied by alpha, in DXT3 it <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> not having <b>been</b> premultiplied by alpha.

30|$|All commits whose message {{matched the}} regular {{expression}} “back.{ 0, 5 }out”, i.e., the words “back” and “out”separated {{by up to}} five characters, <b>were</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> backout commits. The purpose of the five characters separation is to match common variations, such as “backed out” and “backing out”. In a backout commit, all decimal numbers with 5 to 6 digits <b>were</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> issue report identifiers, and all hexadecimal numbers with 7 to 12 digits <b>were</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> commit hashes.|$|R
5|$|A production–possibility {{frontier}} (PPF) or {{production possibility}} curve (PPC) is a graphical representation of possible combinations of two goods (such as butter and guns) {{that can be}} produced with constant technology and resources per unit of time, such that more of one good could be produced only by diverting resources from the other good, resulting in less production of it; i. e. production tradeoffs, usually for an economy, but which can also <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> applying for an individual, household, etc.|$|E
5|$|Corman had initial {{trouble finding}} {{distribution}} for the film, as some distributors, including American International Pictures (AIP), felt that the film would <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> anti-Semitic, citing the characters of Gravis Mushnick and Siddie Shiva. Welles, who is Jewish, stated that he gave his character a Turkish Jewish accent and mannerisms, and that he saw the humor of the film as playful, and felt there was no intent to defame any ethnic group. The film was finally released by its production company, The Filmgroup, nine months after it had been completed.|$|E

3000|$|The {{first factor}} <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> the emotion factor because {{adjective}} pairs such as [...] "tasteful/tasteless" [...] and [...] "pleasant/unpleasant" [...] have high loadings for this factor.

5|$|Listeners {{unfamiliar}} with contemporary Christian music (CCM) often assume that Loder sings hymn-style music. Her career {{is unusual in}} that it began in CCM; most young musicians choose music genres such as country and pop, which are generally considered more likely to bring commercial success.

5|$|Scholars of anthropology, sociology, and {{feminism}} {{have pointed}} out the symbolic nature of phallic architecture, especially large skyscrapers which dominate the landscape as symbols of male domination, power and political authority. Towers and other vertical structures may unintentionally or perhaps subconsciously have those connotations. There are many examples of modern architecture that can <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> phallic, but very few for which the architect has specifically cited or admitted that meaning as an intentional aspect of the design.|$|E
5|$|The Federalist Papers (specifically Federalist No. 84) are {{notable for}} their {{opposition}} to what later became the United States Bill of Rights. The idea of adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was originally controversial because the Constitution, as written, did not specifically enumerate or {{protect the rights of}} the people, rather it listed the powers of the government and left all that remained to the states and the people. Alexander Hamilton, the author of Federalist No. 84, feared that such an enumeration, once written down explicitly, would later <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> a list of the only rights that people had.|$|E
