By realising this article we sought to highlight a number of methodological issues concerning the influencing factors of the two rates of return taking into account the factors that make the turnover and total liabilities. The conversion of the volume and use of assets is intended to guide the company's financial and economic activity to achieve a profit as higher as possible. This has however a number of sides to be analyzed based on two basic elements that put their stamp on the <b>commercial</b> <b>rate</b> of return and on resources consumed, turnover and total expenditure afferent to turnover. The correlation between the volume and the use of fixed assets with the <b>commercial</b> <b>rate</b> of return and the return rate on resources consumed is a crucial objective of economic efficiency in the performances of economic efficiency of the company. fixed assets, <b>commercial</b> <b>rate</b> of return, rate of return on resources consumed, yield...|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{modified}} Froot and Obstfeld (1991 a) simple stochastic macro model, this paper addresses the relative stabilizing {{performance of a}} dual exchange rate system {{from the viewpoint of}} target zones. We focus on an experiment in which the central bank implements a target zone policy in the commercial exchange market to maintain the <b>commercial</b> exchange <b>rate</b> within a specific band, but does not engage in any intervention in the financial exchange market, thus allowing the financial exchange rate to float freely. In contrast to the conventional wisdom, upon the shock of a change in commodity production, we find that the inverse movement of these two rates does not always occur under the target zone perspective. The relative elasticity of the real <b>commercial</b> <b>rate</b> to income in the balance of payments is the crucial point for the desirability of targeting the <b>commercial</b> <b>rate.</b> Therefore, in deciding whether to execute the <b>commercial</b> <b>rate</b> target zone, the central bank needs to consider the country's condition and main goals; the issue may merit consideration in countries that have encountered an aggregate supply shock financial crisis situation. financial crisis, dual exchange rate system, exchange-rate target zones, speculative attacks, exchange regime collapse...|$|R
