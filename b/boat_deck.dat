5|$|Jonathan Evans-Jones as Wallace Hartley: The ship's bandmaster and violinist {{who plays}} {{uplifting}} music with his {{colleagues on the}} <b>boat</b> <b>deck</b> as the ship sinks. As the final plunge begins, he leads the band in a final performance of Nearer, My God, to Thee, {{to the tune of}} Bethany, and dies in the sinking.|$|E
5|$|After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose {{return to}} the <b>boat</b> <b>deck.</b> The {{lifeboats}} have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel only buoyant enough for one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of hypothermia but Rose is saved.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire on the}} <b>boat</b> <b>deck</b> {{penetrated}} to a magazine. Evidence {{given to}} the second board indicated that the doors for the 4-inch ammunition supply trunks were closed throughout the action. It remains possible that a door or trunk could have been opened up by an enemy shell, admitting flames to the magazine. Alternative routes for admission of flame {{could have been the}} ventilation or venting arrangements of the magazines or, as Ted Briggs suggested, through the floor of a 15-inch gunhouse.|$|E
60|$|It was done, and {{in another}} moment he and Appleby stood on the torpedo <b>boat’s</b> <b>deck,</b> where a couple of {{officers}} stared at them.|$|R
50|$|U-95s only kill on her sixth foray was Trinidad. The {{relatively}} small ship was sunk with 37 rounds from the <b>boat's</b> <b>deck</b> gun due west of La Rochelle on 6 September 1941.|$|R
25|$|Unlike the ESDs which {{lower the}} entire ship until their <b>boat</b> <b>decks</b> are awash, ESBs use cranes {{to raise and}} lower small boats of up to 11 metric tons to the water from their mission deck.|$|R
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{destroyed}} by the explosion of her own torpedoes. According to Goodall's theory, the ship's torpedoes could have been detonated either by the fire raging on the <b>boat</b> <b>deck</b> or, more probably, by a direct hit from Bismarck. This would have blown out {{the side of the}} ship, destroying the girder strength of the hull; the force of water entering the hole, at a speed of nearly , would then shear the stern section {{from the rest of the}} hull.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{exterior}} devastation {{caused by the}} bow's descent and collision with the ocean floor, {{there are parts of}} the interior in reasonably good condition. The bow's slow flooding and its relatively smooth descent to the sea floor mitigated interior damage. The stairwell of the First-Class Grand Staircase between the <b>Boat</b> <b>Deck</b> and E Deck is an empty chasm within the wreck, providing a convenient point of access for ROVs. Dense rusticles hanging from the steel decking combined with the deep layers of silt that have accumulated in the interior make navigating the wreck disorienting.|$|E
5|$|Ship's {{regulations}} {{were designed to}} keep third class passengers confined to their area of the ship. The Titanic was fitted with grilles to prevent the classes from mingling and these gates were normally kept closed, although the stewards could open them {{in the event of}} an emergency. In the rush following the collision, the stewards, occupied with waking up sleeping passengers and leading groups of women and children to the <b>boat</b> <b>deck,</b> did not have time to open all the gates, leaving many of the confused third class passengers stuck below decks.|$|E
60|$|Thurid was {{the first}} to reach it, and with the agility of a monkey clambered swiftly to the <b>boat's</b> <b>deck,</b> where a touch of the button {{controlling}} the buoyancy tanks sent the craft slowly upward, though not with the speed that marks the well-conditioned flier.|$|R
50|$|Cordia alliodora is one {{of several}} Cordia trees called bocote in Spanish and its wood, which has very little figure, is usually called freijo or jennywood along with that of Cordia goeldiana. The wood is used for <b>boat</b> <b>decking,</b> furniture, {{cabinetry}} and guitar/bass building luthiers and sometimes substitutes for mahogany or teak.|$|R
5000|$|In 1959 the {{fiberglass}} 13' 8" [...] (4.2 m) hull Super Sailfish MK-II {{model was}} added to the lineup. The MK-II sported an aluminum mast and spars. The deck was available in colors of red, white, blue, green, and yellow with a five panel Dacron sail in alternating panel colors to match the <b>boat’s</b> <b>deck</b> color.|$|R
5|$|The British {{squadron}} {{spotted the}} Germans at 05:37 (ship's clocks were set four hours ahead of local time – the engagement commenced shortly after dawn), but the Germans were already {{aware of their}} presence, Prinz Eugens hydrophones having previously detected the sounds of high-speed propellers to their southeast. The British opened fire at 05:52 with Hood engaging Prinz Eugen, the lead ship in the German formation, and the Germans returned fire at 05:55, both ships concentrating on Hood. Prinz Eugen was probably the first ship to score when a shell hit Hoods <b>boat</b> <b>deck,</b> between her funnels, and started a large fire among the ready-use ammunition for the anti-aircraft guns and rockets of the UP mounts.|$|E
5|$|With {{the ship}} sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the <b>boat</b> <b>deck,</b> Cal and Jack {{encourage}} her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.|$|E
5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the <b>boat</b> <b>deck.</b> Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E
60|$|With {{a prayer}} of {{gratitude}} upon my lips I scrambled upward toward the <b>boat's</b> <b>deck.</b> I could not see Thurid and Matai Shang now, but I heard the sounds of conflict and thus knew that they still fought--the thern for his life and the black for the increased buoyancy that relief from the weight of even a single body would give the craft.|$|R
5000|$|The unorthodox {{procedures}} used {{so well in}} wartime cause tragedy to the couple; Karin loses her job for revealing information and Talbot's haste in launching a missile from his <b>boat's</b> <b>deck</b> results in his serious injury {{and the death of}} his friend Quartermaster [...] "Fuss" [...] Payne (Joe Sawyer). Talbot's depression leaves him not desiring to walk without braces and in danger of being medically discharged from the Navy.|$|R
5000|$|A sub-class of the Knox {{class was}} built, {{commonly}} referred to as the Hewes class. The primary differences were slightly different arrangement of the [...] "Officers Country" [...] staterooms with additional staterooms in the 01 level instead of the open <b>deck</b> between the <b>boat</b> <b>decks.</b> The stateroom on the port side under the bridge was designated as a [...] "flag" [...] stateroom, with the additional staterooms for flag staff when serving as a flagship.|$|R
5|$|At 00:05 on 15 April, Captain Smith {{ordered the}} ship's {{lifeboats}} uncovered and the passengers mustered. He also ordered the radio operators to begin sending distress calls, which wrongly placed the ship {{on the west}} side of the ice belt and directed rescuers to a position that turned out to be inaccurate by about 13.5 nautical miles (15.5mi / 25km). Below decks, water was pouring into the lowest levels of the ship. As the mail room flooded, the mail sorters made an ultimately futile attempt to save the 400,000items of mail being carried aboard Titanic. Elsewhere, air could be heard being forced out by inrushing water. Above them, stewards went door to door, rousing sleeping passengers and crew– Titanic did not have a public address system– and told them to go to the <b>Boat</b> <b>Deck.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} these theories (excepting that of Preston) {{is given in}} Jurens's 1987 article. Its main conclusion is that the loss was almost certainly precipitated by the explosion of a 4-inch magazine, but that {{there are several ways}} this could have been initiated, although he rules out the <b>boat</b> <b>deck</b> fire or the detonation of her torpedoes as probable causes. In Jurens's opinion, the popular image of plunging shells penetrating Hoods deck armour is inaccurate, as by his estimation the angle of fall of Bismarcks 15-inch shells at the moment of the loss would not have exceeded about 14°, an angle so unfavourable to penetration of horizontal armour that it is actually off the scale of contemporaneous German penetration charts. Moreover, computer-generated profiles of Hood show that a shell falling at this angle could not have reached an aft magazine without first passing through some part of the belt armour. On the other hand, the 12-inch belt could have been penetrated, if Hood had progressed sufficiently far into her final turn.|$|E
5|$|Both German ships {{initially}} concentrated {{their fire}} on Hood and destroyed her with salvoes of 8- and 15-inch shells. An 8-inch shell hit the <b>boat</b> <b>deck</b> and struck a ready service locker for the UP rocket projectors, and a fire blazed {{high above the}} first superstructure deck. At 05:58 at a range of , the force commander ordered a turn of 20 degrees to port to open the range and bring the full battery of the British ships to bear on Bismarck. As the turn began, Bismarck straddled Hood with her third and fourth four-gun salvoes and at 06:01 the fifth salvo hit her, causing a large explosion. Flames shot up near Hoods masts, then an orange-coloured fireball and an enormous smoke cloud obliterated the ship. On Prince of Wales, it seemed that Hood collapsed amidships, and the bow and stern could be seen rising as she rapidly settled. Prince of Wales made a sharp starboard turn to avoid hitting the debris {{and in doing so}} further closed the range between her and the German ships. In the four-minute action, Hood, the largest battlecruiser in the world, had been sunk. 1,419 officers and men were killed. Only three men survived.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{attempts}} at jumping off the bridge. The first jump is mistimed, as Sylvester {{lands in the}} smokestack, leaving him with his rear end on fire. A follow-up attempt from another bridge to parachute onto the <b>boat's</b> <b>deck</b> ("Oh, that bad ol' puddy tat! He never give up!") results in a jammed pack, which only opens after Sylvester sinks {{to the bottom of}} the canal ("Aww, the poor puddy tat. Got himself all soaking wet.").|$|R
60|$|It was a {{beautiful}} <b>boat.</b> The <b>deck</b> was gay with lovely ladies and fine gentlemen walking about enjoying the bright spring sunshine.|$|R
50|$|Due to its durability, natural {{water-resistant}} {{qualities and}} striking wood grain, teak {{has historically been}} used in the manufacture of outdoor furniture, <b>boat</b> <b>decks,</b> and other carpentry goods which are to be exposed to the elements for long periods of time. Due to the high demand for this timber and the reasonably short growth period of teak trees, sustainable teak production is currently underway on plantations across many dry tropical climates across Costa Rica and Mexico.|$|R
5|$|William S. Grattan sat boarded-up for {{eighteen}} months while city and fire department officials {{decided whether to}} replace her {{at a cost of}} $225,000 dollars or rebuild her for $99,000 dollars, which was $8,000 dollars more than her original cost. The decision was made to rebuild and in 1930 she was rebuilt at the Buffalo Dry Dock Company of Buffalo, New York. During this refit some improvements were made to William S. Grattan. One improvement was that her boilers were converted from burning coal to burning oil. The engines were rebuilt and her firefighting system was updated and could now handle foam fire retardant. Also, the pilot house was raised to the upper <b>boat</b> <b>deck</b> level and a fixed turret tower with a fire monitor was constructed on the stern of the ship. A fourth fire monitor was added {{to the top of the}} pilot house of the ship as well. As part of her acceptance ceremony she participated in a race against the harbor tug Kentucky, which was considered to be one of the fastest tugs on the Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|Titanic had a {{total of}} 20 lifeboats, {{comprising}} 16wooden boats on davits, 8 {{on either side of}} the ship, and 4 collapsible boats with wooden bottoms and canvas sides. The collapsibles were stored upside down with the sides folded in, and would have to be erected and moved to the davits for launching. Two were stored under the wooden boats and the other two were lashed atop the officers' quarters. The position of the latter would make them extremely difficult to launch, as they weighed several tons each and had to be manhandled down to the <b>boat</b> <b>deck.</b> On average, the lifeboats could take up to 68 people each, and collectively they could accommodate 1,178– barely half the number of people on board and a third of the number the ship was licensed to carry. The shortage of lifeboats was not because of a lack of space nor because of cost. Titanic had been designed to accommodate up to 68lifeboats– enough for everyone on board– and the price of an extra 32lifeboats would only have been some , a tiny fraction of the $7.5 million that the company had spent on Titanic. In an emergency, lifeboats at the time were intended to be used to transfer passengers off the distressed ship and onto a nearby vessel. It was therefore commonplace for liners to have far fewer lifeboats than needed to accommodate all their passengers and crew, and of the 39British liners of the time of over , 33 had too few lifeboat places to accommodate everyone on board. The White Star Line desired the ship to have a wide promenade deck with uninterrupted views of the sea, which would have been obstructed by a continuous row of lifeboats.|$|E

50|$|The Titanics {{collision}} with the iceberg at 11:40 pm on April 14 woke Anton {{and his brother}} and the two ran to the ships welldeck where they clearly saw the iceberg. They returned to their cabin and dressed, barely finishing before water began to pour into their cabin. Anton ran to his wifes cabin and woke its occupants.

50|$|The Argentine Navy {{enhanced}} the offensive capabilities of their Type 42s by fitting MM-38 Exocet missiles. The <b>boat</b> <b>decks</b> {{of the original}} design were replaced by special decks to install the missiles around the funnel, but the launchers were apparently never mounted on Santísima Trinidad. In November 1981 she made her maiden voyage to Britain, where the destroyer carried out her first sea trials, and her crew was trained in the operation and launching of Sea Dart missiles.|$|R

25|$|At about 11:45pm ship's time Gracie was jarred awake by a jolt. He sat up, {{realized}} the ship's engines {{were no longer}} moving, and partially dressed, putting on a Norfolk jacket over his regular clothes.

He then retrieved blankets for the women in the boats, and along with his friend Smith assisted Second Officer Charles Lightoller in filling the remaining lifeboats with women and children.|$|E
25|$|Although Hapag-Lloyd {{originally}} {{considered a}} traditional two-funnel {{design for the}} fourth Europa, they finally opted for a modern, balanced design.

50|$|Teak's {{high oil}} content, high tensile {{strength}} and tight grain make it particularly suitable where weather resistance is desired. It {{is used in the}} manufacture of outdoor furniture and <b>boat</b> <b>decks.</b> It is also used for cutting boards, indoor flooring, countertops and as a veneer for indoor furnishings. Although easily worked, it can cause severe blunting on edged tools {{because of the presence of}} silica in the wood.

50|$|Her second foray {{was split}} into two parts. During the second, longer portion, the boat sank the William Hopper, {{a former member of}} the notorious convoy PQ 17 on 4 July 1942. The ship had already been badly damaged in an air attack. In a scuttling attempt, she was {{fired-on}} by a British escort vessel, but stubbornly refused to sink. Later that same day, U-334 fired two 'coup de grâce' torpedoes at the ship; the first was defective, the second missed. The wreck was eventually sunk by fire from the <b>boat's</b> <b>deck</b> gun.|$|R
