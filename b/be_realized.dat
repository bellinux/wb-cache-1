Recombination may also contribute, in principle, to overcoming the immune defenses of the host. Yet, for the adaptive advantages of genetic variation to <b>be</b> <b>realized,</b> the two viral genomes packaged in individual infecting virus particles need to have arisen from separate progenitor parental viruses of differing genetic constitution. It is unknown how often such mixed packaging occurs under natural conditions.|$|E
5|$|In the {{classical}} {{presentation of a}} three-set Venn diagram as three overlapping circles, the central region (representing elements belonging to all three sets) takes {{the shape of a}} Reuleaux triangle. The same three circles form one of the standard drawings of the Borromean rings, three mutually linked rings that cannot, however, <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as geometric circles. Parts of these same circles are used to form the triquetra, a figure of three overlapping semicircles (each two of which form a vesica piscis symbol) that again has a Reuleaux triangle at its center; just as the three circles of the Venn diagram may be interlaced to form the Borromean rings, the three circular arcs of the triquetra may be interlaced to form a trefoil knot.|$|E
5|$|The {{irreducible}} infinite-dimensional unitary representations {{may have}} indirect relevance to physical reality in speculative modern theories since the (generalized) Lorentz group appears {{as the little}} group of the Poincare group of spacelike vectors in higher spacetime dimension. The corresponding infinite-dimensional unitary representations of the (generalized) Poincaré group are the so-called tachyonic representations. Tachyons appear in the spectrum of bosonic strings and are associated with instability of the vacuum. Even though tachyons may not <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> in nature, these representations must be mathematically understood {{in order to understand}} string theory. This is so since tachyon states turn out to appear in superstring theories too in attempts to create realistic models.|$|E

5|$|This {{would involve}} {{replacing}} the eight Pratt & Whitney TF33 engines (total thrust 8 × 17,000lb) with four RB211 engines (total thrust 4 × 37,400lb), which would increase range and reduce fuel consumption, {{at a cost}} of approximately US$2.56billion for the whole fleet (71 aircraft at $36 million each). However, an Air Force analysis in 1997 concluded that Boeing's estimated savings of US$4.7billion would not <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> and that re-engining would instead cost US$1.3billion over keeping the existing engines, citing significant up-front procurement and re-tooling expenditure, as well as the RB211's higher maintenance cost.|$|E
