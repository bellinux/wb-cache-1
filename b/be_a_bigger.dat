I Corps continued the attack towards Caen, but the Germans were able to reinforce the defenders, which {{made it impossible to}} rush the city with small numbers of men and tanks. On 9 June, the Allied ground forces commander, General Bernard Montgomery, revised Operation Perch to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> attack with a pincer movement to surround the city. After delays caused by the time taken to get the attacking forces into position, on 12 June, simultaneous attacks began west and east of Caen. On {{the east side of the}} Orne River, in the airborne bridgehead, two attacking brigades of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division were held up by the 21st Panzer Division and on 13 June, the attack was called off. To the west of Caen, XXX Corps was unable to advance south of the village of Tilly-sur-Seulles against the Panzer-Lehr Division, one of the most powerful armoured formations in the German army, which had recently arrived in Normandy.|$|E

[...] Some of the paratroopers and armor drove north to operate in the Fatah camp. [...] The paratroopers destroyed most of the camp; many of the Palestinians, including Arafat, fled eastward. The rest of the Allenby Bridge force was blocked to the east and south of Shuna, by elements of the 1st Division's central and southern brigades, and by a tank battalion from Salt. A small force of Israeli infantry and armor, on the right flank of Israeli forces invading from the south, tried to protect the allenby bridge force from attacks by the Jordanian forces deployed near the King Abdullah bridge. The Jordanians attacked with some armor, but the Israelis put up resistance, and the battle turned into a stalemate.|$|E

Over the following months, Gambino disappeared from social media, remaining reclusive while recording material for the album. The album was primarily recorded in Miami Heat player Chris Bosh's mansion in Los Angeles, which Gambino dubbed [...] "The Temple".

2500|$|The Napthine Government was criticised for its {{decision}} to withhold details of the business case for the project, including projected traffic levels. State Treasurer Michael O'Brien said the public release of details would jeopardise competitive advantage as it sought bidders for its construction, but federal advisory body Infrastructure Australia subsequently sought more information, claiming {{it had not been}} provided with the information to assess whether the link deserved federal funding. Chris Hale, lecturer in transport engineering at Melbourne University, said the government was not interested in Infrastructure Australia analysing benefit-cost ratios and that the project was an example of a lack of transparency over the approval and planning of major projects and Victorian Greens MP Greg Barber said the government was terrified that releasing the figures would show the road was not viable. [...] "The figures will show this toll road is a dud," [...] he said. [...] "It will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> lemon than the desalination plant." [...] The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia expressed a reluctance to invest in the project unless it could be proven to be profitable, though several major superannuation funds said they would have a [...] "strong appetite" [...] for the project if investor risk was minimised by direct payments by government. A senate committee investigation in February 2014 found that the state government's estimate, previously withheld from the public, showed a benefit-cost ratio of 80 cents per dollar invested if the estimated effects of economies of agglomeration were not taken into account, per the methodology used by Infrastructure Australia. The federal statutory authority recommends only those projects with a benefit-cost ratio of at least 1.5.|$|E
