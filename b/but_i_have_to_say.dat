500|$|TV Guide {{referred}} to Todd as a breakout character. At {{the height of}} his popularity, which was called [...] "Todd-mania" [...] and [...] "the Todd Manning phenomenon", Howarth was disturbed that so many women were attracted to Todd and that the show's writers had begun to redeem the character. [...] In a September 1995 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the publication stated that Howarth was troubled that [...] "his villainous character became such a fan favorite". In October 1995, Howarth told SOD, [...] "People have {{come up to me and}} said, 'My 7-year-old loves you.' What do I say to that? I'm not going to tell them, 'Don't let your 7-year-old watch TV.' <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> it's disturbing." [...] He gave credit to the show's writers for Todd's popularity, saying that the rapists' trial was well constructed and added, [...] "I think, right now, we're just riding the wave of something that started last summer. Beyond that, I don't really know why people like Todd".|$|E

2500|$|Howarth {{went on to}} say Todd and Marty {{suddenly}} bonding did {{not make}} sense and that he could not, in good conscience, promote the story of Todd Lord, who had become a likeable character. [...] "If the rape had been an unrealistic, soapy thing, then it wouldn't matter. But because it was so in-depth and so brutal, to show Todd and Marty having drinks together in Rodi's [...] to show Marty feeling safe and comfortable with Todd [...] is bizarre," [...] he said. [...] "People have {{come up to me and}} said, 'My 7-year-old loves you.' What do I say to that?

2500|$|The final single, [...] "God's Hotel" [...] was co-written with Nick Cave. Kelly {{had read}} Cave's book of lyrics, King Ink (1988), and found [...] "God's Hotel". When {{interviewing}} Cave for {{a newspaper article}} in The Age, Kelly asked about the lyrics, Cave said [...] "It's just a blues ... You can use the words if you want". Kelly only used five of twelve verses and adapted the tune from the chords of [...] "Bittersweet" [...] by Hoodoo Gurus. [...] "Everybody Wants to Touch Me" [...] describes how a pregnant woman becomes the object of curiosity, wonder or revulsion. Although some believe the song relates to a celebrity being the centre of attention (see Paul Kapsis' cover version). In 2000 Kelly's friend Deborah Conway recorded her version for The Women at the Well tribute album. Kelly noted [...] "I don't like all covers of my songs <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this one's awesome. Absolutely". [...] "Lately" [...] was co-written with Geyer and followed their work on the soundtrack for the ABC-TV mini series The Seven Deadly Sins, Geyer and Kelly sang alongside Vika Bull and Conway for the 13 tracks. The cover art for Wanted Man is a colophon rendering of Australia's legendary outlaw Ned Kelly (no relation) as a guitarist and was painted by David Band.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with 'MaximoTV' on April 12, 2010, Ciara announced that the album would be titled, Basic Instinct. The title {{was inspired by the}} 1992 film of the same name, which starred Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas. Stone's character, Catherine Tramell, was a beautiful, seductive, and stealthy crime writer. Ciara told the interviewer [...] "When you get the record, you're gonna get a really fun vibe. You're gonna get an even more sensual side and also confident and cocky. I got like such an attitude on this record, but in such a fun way." [...] One song which follows this theme is [...] "I Run It," [...] Rap-Up described it as a sensual slow jam. The new album is said to sound much like Ciara's debut album, Goodies, and her 2006 single, [...] "Promise," [...] following on from comments made by Tricky Stewart that Ciara was going back to her roots with this album. Meanwhile, she told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul magazine, that [...] "Basic Instinct is really about her trusting her instinct and going back to the R/urban basics in her music – like where she first started, in the days of [...] "Goodies" [...] and [...] "1, 2 Step." [...] In a later interview with Maxim, she said [...] "The album is about our basic wants and desires. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct was smart, a little shady, and she definitely had a sexy gangsta thing going on." ...|$|E
