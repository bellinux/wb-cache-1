50|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that it is widely {{referred}} to as an antiandrogen in the literature, <b>bifluranol</b> is actually a pure estrogen and does not significantly bind to the androgen receptor or directly antagonize the action of androgens. It exerts functional antiandrogen effects by binding to and activating the estrogen receptor in the pituitary gland, consequently suppressing the secretion of luteinizing hormone (and hence acting as an antigonadotropin) and thereby reducing gonadal androgen production and systemic androgen levels. <b>Bifluranol</b> has also been found to act as a 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase inhibitor, though with less potency than ketoconazole, and this action may contribute to its efficacy in benign prostatic hyperplasia by further helping to lower androgen levels.|$|E
5000|$|Antigonadotropins: {{drugs that}} {{suppress}} the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-induced release of gonadotropins and consequent activation of gonadal androgen production. Examples include GnRH analogues like leuprorelin and cetrorelix, progestogens like chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, osaterone acetate (veterinary), and oxendolone, and estrogens like estradiol, estradiol esters, ethinylestradiol, conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin), diethylstilbestrol, and <b>bifluranol.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Androgen {{synthesis}} inhibitors: {{drugs that}} directly inhibit the enzymatic biosynthesis of androgens like testosterone and/or DHT. Examples include the CYP17A1 inhibitors ketoconazole, abiraterone acetate, and seviteronel, the CYP11A1 (P450scc) inhibitor aminoglutethimide, and the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride, dutasteride, epristeride, alfatradiol, and saw palmetto extract (Serenoa repens). A {{number of other}} antiandrogens, including cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, medrogestone, flutamide, nilutamide, and <b>bifluranol,</b> are also known to weakly inhibit androgen synthesis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bifluranol</b> (INN, BAN; {{brand name}} Prostarex; former {{developmental}} code name BX-341) is a nonsteroidal estrogen of the stilbestrol group related to diethylstilbestrol {{that is used}} as an antiandrogen in the United Kingdom {{in the treatment of}} benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is a polyfluorinated biphenyl that is related to polybrominated and polychlorinated biphenyls and diethylstilbestrol. The drug is described as a weak estrogen, and possesses about one-eighth the potency of diethylstilbestrol.|$|E
50|$|Examples of GnRH {{agonists}} include leuprorelin (leuprolide) and goserelin, {{while an}} example of a GnRH antagonist is cetrorelix. Estrogens that are or that have been used as antigonadotropins include estradiol, estradiol esters like estradiol valerate, estradiol undecylate, and polyestradiol phosphate, conjugated equine estrogens, ethinylestradiol, diethylstilbestrol (no longer widely used), and <b>bifluranol.</b> Progestogens that are used as antigonadotropins include chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and oxendolone.|$|E
