5|$|The Open Cup is {{not held}} in as high regard as the MLS Cup, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> an {{important}} achievement. For Philadelphia, it represented their first-ever {{chance at a}} trophy, whereas Seattle {{had been to the}} finals five times in the club's six-year history. With a victory, the Sounders would tie the Fire with four overall wins by an MLS team.|$|E

5|$|Sappho was a {{prolific}} poet, probably composing around 10,000 lines. Her poetry was well-known and greatly admired {{through much of}} antiquity, and she was among the canon of nine lyric poets most highly esteemed by scholars of Hellenistic Alexandria. Today, most of Sappho's poetry is lost, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> considered extraordinary, and her works have continued to influence other writers up until the modern day. Beyond her poetry, she is well known {{as a symbol of}} love and desire between women.|$|E

5|$|The more populous {{northern}} part of the country, comprising about 30% of the country's total area, is called the Swiss Plateau. It has greater open and hilly landscapes, partly forested, partly open pastures, usually with grazing herds, or vegetables and fruit fields, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> hilly. There are large lakes found here and the biggest Swiss cities are in this area of the country.|$|E
5|$|Americium is {{produced}} mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of {{spent nuclear fuel}} contains about 100grams of various americium isotopes, mostly 241Am and 243Am. Their prolonged radioactivity is undesirable for the disposal, and therefore americium, together with other long-lived actinides, must be neutralized. The associated procedure may involve several steps, where americium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure is well known as nuclear transmutation, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> being developed for americium. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 18th century, law {{enforcement}} in the counties of Croatia included county pandurs or hussars who patrolled roads and pursued criminals. In 1740, the term was applied to frontier guard duty infantry deployed in the Croatian Military Frontier (Banal Frontier), specifically its Karlovac and Varaždin Generalcies. The role of the pandurs as security guards was extended to Dalmatia after the establishment of Austrian rule there in the early 19th century. The term has dropped from official use for law enforcement officials, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> used colloquially in Croatia and the Western Balkans in a manner akin to the English word cop. The unit raised and led by Trenck is also referred to more specifically as Trenck's Pandurs, and less frequently in Croatia than elsewhere, as Croatian Pandurs.|$|E

5|$|Capella {{has long}} been {{suspected}} to be slightly variable. Its amplitude of about 0.1 magnitudes means that it may at times be brighter or fainter than both Rigel and Vega, which are also slightly variable. The system has been classified as an RS Canum Venaticorum variable, a class of binary stars with active chromospheres that cause huge starspots, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> only listed as a suspected variable in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars. Unusually for RS CVn systems, the hotter star, Capella Ab, has the more active atmosphere because it {{is located in the}} Hertzsprung gap—a stage where it is changing its angular momentum and deepening its convection zone.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{game that}} used a {{graphical}} display, the cathode-ray tube amusement device is generally not considered under most definitions to {{be a candidate for}} the first video game, as it used purely analog hardware and did not run on a computing device; some loose definitions may still consider it a video game, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> usually disqualified as the device was never manufactured. Nevertheless, it is the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to incorporate an electronic display, thus making it a forerunner to other games in the early history of video games. As the device was never manufactured or widely shown, however, it did not directly inspire any other games and had no impact on the future video game industry.|$|E
5|$|The Large Black {{combined}} local black pig breeds {{from the}} West Country and the East of England. With {{the founding of}} a breed association in 1898 or 1899, variations between the types from the two areas decreased. The Large Black was popular in the early 1900s and was exported to {{many areas of the}} world. Population numbers declined after the Second World War as farmers turned to breeds more suitable to intensive pig farming, and by the 1960s the breed was almost extinct. Numbers have slowly risen, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> considered vulnerable by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, and Rare Breeds Canada.|$|E
