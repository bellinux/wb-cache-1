5|$|Upon its release, {{the song}} {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from music critics, {{many of whom}} praised Lee's emotional vocal performance and production; others described it as uninspired and mundane. The single achieved moderate commercial success, failing {{to appear on the}} main U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and entering the top 40 in several countries worldwide, where it spent several weeks charting. A music video directed by Paul Fedor was released in November 2006 and it features Lee and the band performing the song in a snowy forest. Lee eventually drowns in a lake full of <b>black</b> <b>water</b> which is meant to illustrate the song's lyrics about feelings of sorrow. The song was performed by the band as part of the set list on four of their five worldwide tours, namely The Open Door Tour (2006–07), the Evanescence Tour (2011-12), their fourth worldwide tour which took place in the period 2016-17 and the Synthesis Tour (2017-18).|$|E

50|$|<b>Black</b> {{and white}} <b>waters</b> differ {{significantly}} in their ionic composition, {{as shown in}} Table 1. <b>Black</b> <b>waters</b> are more acidic, resulting in an aluminum concentration {{greater than that of}} the more neutral white waters. The major difference is the concentrations of sodium, magnesium, calcium and potassium; these are very low in <b>black</b> <b>waters.</b> This has ecological implications. Some animals need more calcium than is available in blackwaters, so for example, snails, which need much calcium to build shells, are not abundant in blackwaters. The lack of dissolved ions in <b>black</b> <b>waters</b> results in a low conductivity, similar to that of rainwater.|$|R

25|$|Stratovarius {{was founded}} as <b>Black</b> <b>Water</b> in August 1984 by singer and drummer Tuomo Lassila, guitarist Staffan Stråhlman, and bassist John Vihervä. Line-up changes soon started to occur, {{including}} Timo Tolkki replacing Stråhlman {{two months later}} and taking over singing duties as well, and the band expanding to a quintet {{with the arrival of}} keyboarist Antti Ikonen the following year. Under this line-up, the band released its first album Fright Night in 1989, with Tolkki acting as sole composer. While various changes of bassist occurred, the band released the albums Twilight Time (1992) and Dreamspace (1994). In 1994, Tolkki decided to stop acting as lead vocalist, with Kotipelto joining the band.

25|$|In any case, an {{efficient}} surveillance {{is essential to}} monitor the presence of tiger mosquitoes {{and the effect of}} control programs. Ovitraps are normally used for the monitoring of Ae. albopictus. They are <b>black</b> <b>water</b> containers with floating Styrofoam blocks or small wooden paddles that are in contact with the surface of the water. Female tiger mosquitoes lay their eggs on these surfaces. Through the identification of these eggs or of the larvae that hatch from these eggs in the laboratory, the presence and abundance of mosquito species can be estimated. Versions of these traps with an adhesive film (sticky traps) that catch the egg-depositing mosquitoes make the analysis much easier and quicker, but are more complicated in terms of handling. The results of ovitraps are often variable and depend on the availability of alternative egg-depositing waters. Due to this, it is best to use them in large numbers and in conjunction with other monitoring methods.|$|E

500|$|Crocodilians are {{sometimes}} used as mascots for sports teams. The Canton Crocodiles were {{a baseball team}} in the Frontier League, while the University of Florida sport teams are known as the Florida Gators, {{in reference to the}} American alligator, and their mascots are Albert and Alberta Gator.

Some media have attempted to portray these reptiles in more positive or educational light, such as Steve Irwin's wildlife documentary series The Crocodile Hunter.

500|$|Today I {{am afraid}} that fish in most of those rivers are {{virtually}} extinct. Anybody who stands today in the City of Manchester outside the Exchange Station and {{looks down at the}} noisome <b>black</b> <b>water</b> which flows beneath him would find it difficult to believe that any fish, or any other living creature, could ever have lived in what the Manchester Guardian has so rightly called that [...] "melancholy stream"... I have had my differences with the British Field Sports Society, but I have nothing but admiration for the excellent series of reports on river pollution which have been prepared for that Society... and ventured to suggest that they should make a similar survey of the Rivers Irwell and Roach. These two rivers were covered by the third report; and very sorry reading it made. There are two passages in that report which I should like to read. The first says: [...] "The banks are lined with factories, large and small, many of which take their water from the drainage of the hills forming the slopes of the river's valley, and discharge it as a polluted effluent, either into the small feeders, or the main river itself, so it may be said that no natural water normally enters the river from its cradle in the moors to its grave in the Manchester Ship Canal." [...] The second quotation is one which I find still more appalling than the first. It is: [...] "There are no fish in these rivers (apart from a very occasional tributary), no insects, no weeds, no life of any kind except sewage fungus, nothing but chemicals and any dirt which cannot be put to profitable use. Sewage effluents (and, being usually very good, they are the most encouraging feature of the appalling situation) are hailed with delight as being the purest water which the rivers hold." [...] The full importance of that statement will be realised when I remind hon. Members of the frequency with which residents in Bacup, Ramsbottom, Manchester and Salford are subjected to flooding from the waters of the Irwell.|$|E
