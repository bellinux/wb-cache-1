40|$|This thesis {{examines}} problems <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> {{in international}} {{carriage of goods}} by sea. The objectives of the thesis are twofold. The primary objective is the identification of major legal problems associated with <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> The second objective is to evaluate the adequacy <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> legislation in protecting the legitimate rights and interest of the parties. Legal problems confronting <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> legislation are 'title to sue' and 'third party liability' which cause difficulties and obstades to the legal function <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> Another problem in <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> concern marine cargo liability regimes. Under existing international law there is no uniformity in marine cargo liability regimes which results in a conflict of laws. Notwithstanding the entry into force of the United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea, the Hamburg Rules, in 1992, {{there is evidence that}} the Rules are not accepted by major shipping nations. Moreover, recent developments concerning electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> play a vital part. The thesis seeks to emphasise the problems which exist {{as a result of the}} inconsistencies between law and practice in this area. Attention is also drawn to the use of Electronic Data Interchange (EDT) as electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> together with its legal aspects. The thesis argues that the entry into force of the Hamburg Rules, as a whole, did not provide significant changes in international carriage of goods by sea even though some countries, such as the People's Republic of China, had developed some concepts of the Rules. This argument is based on a number of factors including the principle of marine cargo liability, the current position of major shipping nations, and empirical evidence of the impact of the adoption of the Rules. The conclusion of the thesis is that <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> legislative reform can eliminate major legal problem and sufficient enough to facilitate the use <b>of</b> electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> With regard to Australia, the Australian marine cargo liability regime have been improved to promote better balance of rights and liabilities between parties to a contract of carriage, and it becomes more compatible with those regimes of its trading partners...|$|R
25|$|The first {{cargo of}} tea landed {{could be very}} {{profitable}} for tea merchants, so they introduced incentives. In 1854, Vision had a premium of an extra £1 per ton included in her <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading,</b> payable if {{she was the first}} to dock. In 1855 Maury and Lord of the Isles raced for a premium of £1 per ton, with the latter the winner through getting a better tug to get up-river. Note that the premium did not simply reward the fastest passage, since rapid loading of a cargo and a prompt departure were important factors. In 1861, the consignees offered a premium of 10s per ton to the first ship to dock in London. This was won by the Fiery Cross, who also went on to win in 1862, 1863 and 1865.|$|E

40|$|This {{comparative}} thesis {{addresses the}} evidentiary value <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> and estoppel under the Hague and Hague/Visby Rules, {{the law in}} the United Kingdom and the United States. After an analysis of the travaux prepraratoires of the Hague and Hague/Visby Rules, and a comparison with the Hamburg Rules, the thesis focuses on the English common law and the relevant statutory provisions. The thesis advocates a new, alternative approach in order to overcome the current interpretive problems with the application of the common law doctrine of estoppel. The analysed provisions are those of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1971 (U. K.), an enactment of the Hague/Visby Rules, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1992 (U. K.), the U. S. Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1936, an enactment of the Hague Rules, and the U. S. Federal <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lading</b> Act, 1994. Further reference will be made to the relevant provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1924 (U. K.) (repealed), the <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lading</b> Act, 1855 (U. K.) (repealed), and the U. S. Federal <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lading</b> Act, 1916 (Pomerene Act), re-enacted as the U. S. Federal <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lading</b> Act, 1994.

2500|$|The 1999 Act's reforms mean {{a number}} of old cases would be decided {{differently}} today. In Beswick v Beswick while the House of Lords held that Mrs Beswick could specifically enforce a promise of her nephew to her deceased husband to pay her £5 weekly in her capacity as administratrix of the will, the 1999 Act would also allow her to claim as a third party. In Scruttons Ltd v Midland Silicones Ltd {{it would have been}} possible for a stevedore firm to claim the benefit of a limitation clause in a contract between a carrier and the owner of a damaged drum of chemicals. Lord Denning dissented, arguing for abolition of the rule, and Lord Reid gave an opinion that if a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> expressly conferred the benefit of a limitation on the stevedores, the stevedores give authority to the carrier to do that, and [...] "difficulties about consideration moving from the stevedore were overcome" [...] then the stevedores could benefit. In The Eurymedon, Lord Reid's inventive solution was applied where some stevedores similarly wanted the benefit of an exclusion clause after dropping a drilling machine, the consideration being found as the stevedores performing their pre-existing contractual duty {{for the benefit of the}} third party (the drilling machine owner). Now none of this considerably technical analysis is required, given that any contract purporting to confer a benefit on a third party may in principle be enforced by the third party.|$|E
