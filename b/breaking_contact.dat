5|$|The 2/18th {{attempted}} {{to defend the}} Tengah Airfield, but by 1:00pm in the afternoon of 9 February they {{had been reduced to}} only 330 men and were withdrawn back to the south-east of the airfield, occupying a position around Bulim along the Chu Kang Road, with the 2/29th Battalion on their left. Throughout the night of 9/10 February, minor clashes occurred as patrols were sent out to fend off Japanese probes. The battalion continued to hold the line until 6:00am when, following receipt of orders to withdraw, it moved back to Keat Hong village to take up the role of brigade reserve. The carrier platoon covered the battalion's withdrawal, and amidst heavy artillery shelling, they ambushed two Japanese columns, each roughly company-sized, inflicting heavy casualties upon them with their Vickers machine-guns before <b>breaking</b> <b>contact.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Company—now under Lieutenant Lawrence Clark {{following}} Chitts' wounding that afternoon—had {{only just}} succeeded in <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> from the Chinese, suffering a number killed and wounded during a confused withdrawal. Meanwhile, B Company {{had also been}} forced to fight its way down the hill. Both companies were now well clear of their former positions and {{would have had a}} hard time fighting their way back. Ultimately {{it was too late for}} the Australians to regain the feature in darkness, and the weight of the Chinese attack continued to mount. Only D Company on the southern right flank—which had been left unmolested—was able to regain its previous position on Hill 63. Meanwhile, the positions previously occupied by A and B Companies were occupied by the Chinese in superior numbers, and the remainder of 3 RAR concentrated at the railway crossing instead. At 22:00 Coad arranged to shell and mortar the relinquished ridge, while a standing patrol from the Middlesex was posted on the south-western side of the Maenjung-dong pass in anticipation of a renewed Chinese attack. However, following heavy fighting the pressure on the Australians unexpectedly ceased after midnight, and parties of Chinese were observed beginning to withdraw.|$|E
25|$|Also on the 24th, Ney {{bumped into}} a Prussian rear guard under Oberstleutnant Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow at Górzno {{and pushed it}} back. Bülow joined La Roche-Aymon's {{detachment}} and the two continued falling back. Ney sent General of Division Jean Gabriel Marchand's division ahead toward Soldau and Mława while holding the other division at Górzno. On 25 December, Marchand with two regiments attacked the single Prussian battalion at Soldau and drove {{it out of the}} town at 2:00 PM. The rest of his division, which had taken a roundabout path through Mława soon arrived. L'Estocq attacked Soldau at about 5:00 PM, but was unable to break into the town despite hand-to-hand fighting. He retreated north to Neidenberg (Nidzica), <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> with the Russian army.|$|E

25|$|On 3 February, Napoleon's army reached Troyes after {{completely}} <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> {{with the}} Allies the previous day. On 4 February, Schwarzenberg wrote his colleague Blücher {{that he was}} moving farther south in order to turn Napoleon's right flank. The next day, Russian General Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly ordered Alexander Nikitich Seslavin's scouting force from Schwarzenberg's right flank to the left flank without notifying Blücher. Since the Prussian field marshal {{did not have a}} liaison officer with Seslavin's force he did not realize that no one was watching for French forces in the space on his left flank. Also on 5 February, Napoleon decided to abandon Troyes and fall back to Nogent-sur-Seine. He planned to contain Schwarzenberg with part of his army while attacking Blücher.|$|E
25|$|Contact {{between the}} two forces was {{reestablished}} on 21 December when a Marine patrol was engaged by a force of 14–18 Japanese around Hill 600A. <b>Breaking</b> <b>contact,</b> the patrol returned to US lines where the situation was reported and subsequently a detachment from the 2nd Battalion, 21st Marines was detailed with returning to the location and putting in an attack that afternoon. The attack went in at 15:45 and {{for the loss of}} one man killed and another wounded they were successful in wresting control of the hill from Japanese, who then retired from the position. As the detachment was too small to hold the position against a Japanese counterattack if one was launched, the Marines returned to their main defensive position before the light failed and reported the situation to the 3rd Division command post.|$|E
25|$|On 6 October, American {{ambassador}} Winthrop G. Brown, {{in ongoing}} attempts at mending the national split, asked King Sisavang Vatthana {{to form a}} caretaker government that would include both sides. Former ambassador and serving Assistant Secretary of State J. Graham Parsons flew in to pressure Souvanna Phouma into <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> with the Soviets. On 17 October, his companion, John N. Irwin II, flew south to Ubon to assure Phoumi of U.S. support. Also in early October, the U.S. suspended aid to Laos. Vang Pao declared that Military Region 2's forces backed Phoumi. After internecine struggle, by 10 November, Military Region 1 remained in Phoumi's control. On 9 November, after agreeing to accept Soviet aid, Souvanna named his new cabinet. It included Quinim Pholsena {{and a couple of}} Pathet Lao officials. This solidified American support for Phoumi. Moreover, on 16 November, General Ouane changed sides; he flew to Savannakhet to join Phoumi.|$|E

40|$|An {{examination}} {{into the}} effects of carried military equipment {{on the performance of}} two tactical combat movement simulations was conducted. Nineteen Airfield Defence Guards performed a <b>break</b> <b>contact</b> (five 30 -m sprints) and a fire and movement simulation (16 6 -m bounds) in five load conditions (10 – 30 kg). Heavier loads significantly increased movement duration on the <b>break</b> <b>contact</b> (0. 8 %/kg load) and fire and movement (1. 1 %/kg). Performance deterioration was observed from the beginning {{to the end of the}} series of movements (bounds or sprints) with deterioration becoming significantly greater in heavier load conditions. Inter-individual variation between slower and faster participants showed a range in load effects; 0. 6, 0. 8 %/kg for fast and 1. 0, 1. 4 %/kg for slow (<b>break</b> <b>contact,</b> fire and movement, respectively). Velocity profiles revealed that the initial acceleration and peak velocity were the primary determinants of performance. As the duration of these tactical combat movements reflects periods of heightened vulnerability, these findings highlight important implications for commanders...|$|R
25|$|The Battle of Britain {{revealed}} the Bf 110's fatal weaknesses as a daylight fighter against single-engine aircraft. A relatively large aircraft, it lacked the agility of the Hurricane and Spitfire and was easily seen. The World War I-era Bristol Fighter had done {{well with a}} rear gunner firing a rifle-caliber machine gun, but by World War II, this was insufficient to deter the eight-gun fighters facing the Bf 110. Its size and weight meant that it had high wing loading, which limited its maneuverability. Furthermore, although it had a higher top speed than contemporary RAF Hurricanes, it had poor acceleration. However, it was unique {{at the time as}} a long-range bomber escort, and did not have the problems of restricted range that hampered the Bf 109E. Although outclassed, it was still formidable as a high escort for bombers using the tactic of diving upon an enemy, delivering a long-range burst from its powerful forward-facing armament, then <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> to run for it.|$|E
25|$|At 05:00 on 26 April the 3rd Battalion {{command post}} and KSCB {{were hit by}} mortar and {{recoilless}} rifle fire. Company K continued their assault on Hill 861 and were joined by Company K, 9th Marines around midday. The assault made little progress and the Marines withdrew protected by fire from helicopter gunships.Company B was also heavily engaged throughout the morning eventually <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> at 12:00 and establishing a defensive perimeter on a knoll, medevac helicopters were called in but as they approached this brought PAVN mortar fire and by 14:45 the Company commander reported that {{he was unable to}} move. Artillery was then walked into and around the Company's position forcing the PAVN to fall back, a Marine platoon was then sent to assist Company B as it fell back to the Battalion command post. Also on 26 April SLF Bravo received urgent orders to move to KSCB to reinforce the 3/3 Marines. 2/3 Marines was flown to Phu Bai Combat Base and from there to KSCB linking up with 3/3 Marines by 16:00 on 26 April.|$|E
25|$|After the war (at {{a dinner}} party in March 1920) Wilson claimed that the Germans ought to have won in 1914 but for bad luck. Bartholomew, {{who had been a}} staff captain at the time, later told Liddell Hart that Wilson had been “the man who saved the British Army” for {{ordering}} Smith-Dorrien to retreat southwards after Le Cateau, thus <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> with the Germans who had expected him to retreat southwest. Wilson played an important role liaising with the French, and also appears to have dissuaded Joffre against further attacks by Lanrezac, with which the British {{would not have been able}} to assist (29 August). Whilst Murray was having an important meeting (4 September) with Gallieni (Military governor of Paris) and Maunoury (commander, French Sixth Army) to discuss the planned Allied counterattack which would become the First Battle of the Marne, Wilson was having a simultaneous meeting with Franchet d’Esperey (Fifth Army, on the British right), which envisaged Sixth Army attacking north of the Marne. Wilson later persuaded Sir John French to cancel his orders to retreat further south (4 September) and helped persuade him to join in the Battle of the Marne (6 September).|$|E

500|$|Japanese forces {{began their}} attack on Hill 260 shortly after 6:00am on 10March, with the {{intention}} of using it to launch follow up attacks on Hills 309 and 608, inside the US perimeter. The initial assault was made by {{all or part of the}} 3rd Battalion, 13th Infantry Regiment and succeeded in capturing the area around the OP tree. Upon being informed of the attack, Griswold ordered that Hill 260 be held at all costs; up to this time the Americal Division's headquarters had not planned to hold the position. E and F Companies of the 2nd Battalion, 182nd Infantry Regiment were subsequently dispatched to the hill. Most of F Company reinforced the survivors of G Company on [...] Hill 260, while E Company and a platoon from F Company mounted a counterattack to retake the lost ground. While the American infantrymen regained some ground, they suffered heavy casualties from Japanese fire and exhaustion before the attack was broken off in the evening of 10 March. The Japanese attacked E Company early in the morning of 11March, but were beaten back. G Company (less its platoon in defensive positions) attempted to relieve E Company later that day, but also came under attack. B Company of the 182nd Infantry Regiment was moved forward to assist the other two companies in <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> with the Japanese forces and retiring to the main perimeter on Hill 260 on the North Knob, and this was successfully achieved during the morning.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a typical}} hard wired motor {{start and stop}} circuit (called a control circuit) a motor is started by pushing a [...] "Start" [...] or [...] "Run" [...] button that {{activates}} a pair of electrical relays. The [...] "lock-in" [...] relay locks in contacts that keep the control circuit energized when the push button is released. (The start button is a normally open contact and the stop button is normally closed contact.) Another relay energizes a switch that powers the device that throws the motor starter switch (three sets of contacts for three phase industrial power) in the main power circuit. Large motors use high voltage and experience high in-rush current, making speed important in making and <b>breaking</b> <b>contact.</b> This can be dangerous for personnel and property with manual switches. The [...] "lock in" [...] contacts in the start circuit and the main power contacts for the motor are held engaged by their respective electromagnets until a [...] "stop" [...] or [...] "off" [...] button is pressed, which de-energizes the lock in relay.|$|E

6000|$|... 1060. The {{peculiar}} {{effects are}} best {{shown by the}} electro-magnet (1056.). When {{it was used to}} complete the communication at the electromotor, there was no sensible spark on making contact, but on <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> there was a very large and bright spark, with considerable combustion of the mercury. Then, again, with respect to the shock: if the hands were moistened in salt and water, and good contact between them and the wires retained, no shock could be felt upon making contact at the electromotor, but a powerful one on <b>breaking</b> <b>contact.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 1104. On {{adjusting}} a platina wire at x (1081.) so that {{it should}} not be ignited by the current passing through it whilst contact at G and E was continued, and yet become red-hot by a current somewhat more powerful, I was readily able to produce its ignition upon making contact, and again upon <b>breaking</b> <b>contact.</b> Thus the momentary retardation in ABD on making contact was again shown by this result, as well also as the opposite result upon <b>breaking</b> <b>contact.</b> The two ignitions of the wire at x were of course produced by electric currents moving in opposite directions.|$|E
6000|$|... 1068. The {{effect of}} {{elongation}} was well shown thus: 114 feet of copper wire, one-eighteenth {{of an inch}} in diameter, were extended {{on the floor and}} used as a conductor; it remained cold, but gave a bright spark on <b>breaking</b> <b>contact.</b> Being crossed so that the two terminations were in contact near the extremities, it was again used as a conductor, only twelve inches now being included in the circuit: the wire became very hot from the greater quantity of electricity passing through it, and yet the spark on <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> was scarcely visible. The experiment was repeated with a wire one-ninth of an inch in diameter and thirty-six feet long with the same results.|$|E

6000|$|... 1061. When the helix i or iii (1053, &c.) {{was used}} as the {{connecting}} conductor, there was also a good spark on <b>breaking</b> <b>contact,</b> but none (sensibly) on making contact. On trying to obtain the shock from these helices, I could not succeed at first. By joining the similar ends of i and ii so as to make the two helices equivalent to one helix, having wire of double thickness, I could just obtain the sensation. Using the helix of thick wire (1055.) the shock was distinctly obtained. On placing the tongue between two plates of silver connected by wires with the parts which the hands had heretofore touched (1064.), there was a powerful shock on <b>breaking</b> <b>contact,</b> but none on making contact.|$|E
6000|$|... 209. On {{making and}} <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> between the soft iron {{bar and the}} poles of the magnet, the {{galvanometer}} was strongly affected; on detaching the zinc it was still more strongly affected in the same direction. On taking all the precautions before alluded to (207.), with others, it was abundantly proved that the current induced by the magnet in copper was far more powerful than in zinc.|$|E
6000|$|... 1081. On {{introducing}} a fine platina wire at x, and employing the electro-magnet at D, no visible effects occurred {{as long as}} contact was continued; but on <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> at G or E, the fine wire was instantly ignited and fused. A longer or thicker wire could be so adjusted at x as to show ignition, without fusion, every time the contact was broken at G or E.|$|E
