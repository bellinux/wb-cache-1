5|$|Although {{precursors}} to {{this table}} exist, its invention is generally credited to Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. Mendeleev invented {{the table to}} illustrate recurring ("periodic") trends in {{the properties of the}} elements. The layout of the table has been refined and extended over time, as new elements have been discovered, and new theoretical models have <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> explain chemical behavior.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} {{different}} types of cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, are acted on by aspirin. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory. Newer NSAID drugs, COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs), have <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> inhibit only PTGS2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E

5|$|Both CVD and HPHT {{diamonds}} can be {{cut into}} gems and various colors can be produced: clear white, yellow, brown, blue, green and orange. The appearance of synthetic gems on the market created major concerns in the diamond trading business, {{as a result of}} which special spectroscopic devices and techniques have <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> distinguish synthetic and natural diamonds.|$|E
5|$|Definitive {{laboratory}} {{identification of}} variola virus involves growing the virus on chorioallantoic membrane (part of a chicken embryo) and examining the resulting pock lesions under defined temperature conditions. Strains may {{be characterized by}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) analysis. Serologic tests and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), which measure variola virus-specific immunoglobulin and antigen have also <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> assist in the diagnosis of infection.|$|E
5|$|Emphasis in Alzheimer's {{research}} {{has been placed on}} diagnosing the condition before symptoms begin. A number of biochemical tests have <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> attempt earlier detection.

5|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is the modification of an organism's genome through biotechnology. Since the 1970s, {{a variety of}} techniques have <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> specifically add, remove and edit genes in an organism. Recently developed genome engineering techniques use engineered nuclease enzymes to create targeted DNA repair in a chromosome to either disrupt or edit a gene when the break is repaired. The related term synthetic biology is sometimes used to refer to extensive genetic engineering of an organism.|$|E
5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} to high ambient pressure have physiological effects that limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Humans are not physiologically and anatomically well adapted to the environmental conditions of diving, and various equipment has <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> extend the depth and duration of human dives, and allow different types {{of work to be}} done.|$|E
5|$|Labeling and {{inhibition}} of the proteasome is also {{of interest in}} laboratory settings for both in vitro and in vivo study of proteasomal activity in cells. The most commonly used laboratory inhibitors are lactacystin and the peptide aldehyde MG132 initially developed by Goldberg lab.

5|$|Various chromatographic {{methods have}} <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> detect {{psilocin}} in body fluids: the rapid emergency drug identification system (REMEDi HS), a drug screening method based on HPLC; HPLC with electrochemical detection; GC–MS; and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Although {{the determination of}} psilocin levels in urine can be performed without sample clean-up (i.e., removing potential contaminants that {{make it difficult to}} accurately assess concentration), the analysis in plasma or serum requires a preliminary extraction, followed by derivatization of the extracts in the case of GC–MS. A specific immunoassay has also <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> detect psilocin in whole blood samples. A 2009 publication reported using HPLC to quickly separate forensically important illicit drugs including psilocybin and psilocin, which were identifiable within about half a minute of analysis time. These analytical techniques to determine psilocybin concentrations in body fluids are, however, not routinely available, and not typically used in clinical settings.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{forecasting}} of wind, precipitations {{and humidity}} {{is essential for}} preventing and controlling wildfires.

Conditions {{for the development of}} harmful insects can be predicted by forecasting the evolution of weather, too.|$|E
5|$|Advocacy of such {{a nation}} became illegal when separatist demands were banned by law in 1957. Regardless of these measures, a Dravida Nadu Separation Day was {{observed}} on 17 September 1960 resulting in numerous arrests. However, Periyar resumed his campaign in 1968. He wrote an editorial on 'Tamil Nadu for Tamilians' in which he stated, that by nationalism only Brahmins had prospered and nationalism had <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> abolish the rights of Tamils.

5|$|Armillaria calvescens {{is rather}} similar in appearance, {{and can only}} be {{reliably}} distinguished from A.gallica by observing microscopic characteristics. A.calvescens has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the Great Lakes. A.mellea has a thinner stem than A.gallica, but can be more definitively distinguished {{by the absence of}} clamps {{at the base of the}} basidia. Similarly, A.cepistipes and A.gallica are virtually identical in appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and microscopic characteristics. Molecular methods have <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> discriminate between the two species by comparing DNA sequences in the gene coding translation elongation factor 1-alpha.|$|E
5|$|Buildings, {{operations}} and management {{have become increasingly}} sophisticated since the mid 20th century, when international airports began to provide infrastructure for international civilian flights.

5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} Hydnellum are {{hindered}} {{by the fact}} that some species are difficult to discriminate in the field, making it hard to determine an appropriate conservation status.
