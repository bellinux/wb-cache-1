500|$|Apart {{from the}} final track, [...] "Mørket's Grøde", and the {{instrumental}} [...] "Tilflukt", all song lyrics are written in English. Zuza Steck of the Polish magazine Musick Magazine noted the [...] "unblack" [...] - Christian - message of the lyrics and how Antestor demonstrates that a band can maintain an extreme atmosphere but take a different lyrical approach. Antestor expounded on the lyrical themes that [...] "at {{the same time that}} we are Christians, we are also humans. I think almost everyone can relate to parts of our music and lyrics, for absolutely everyone – Christians and non-believers alike – experience hard and terrible times. The Lord does not say we will not meet hard times as Christians, but that He will <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> and carry us through it, and that {{is a big part of}} the Antestor message." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{make the}} {{distinction}} between mainstream and extremist Arab opinion clear, in 2002 Jordanian journalist Rami George Khouri suggested calling the latter the [...] "Arab basement." [...] New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman picked it up, noting that the Arab street, {{in opposition to the}} [...] "basement", is [...] "largely passive and nonviolent." [...] While the U.S. and the West {{had no choice but to}} defeat the basement, since it was beyond reason, he said it was not too late to work with Arab states to address the very real grievances that led from the street to the basement. [...] "If America made clear that it was going into Iraq," [...] he wrote, [...] "not just to disarm Iraq but to empower Iraq's people to implement the Arab Human Development Report, well, the Arab basement still wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> but the Arab street just might." ...|$|E

Like everything else – hits, boots, hair and sponsorship deals – moments are very big in Beyoncé world. An age later, cheers erupt for the raising of a curtain which revealed, er, a roadie fiddling with a drum kit. An hour later, the piped music is getting gradually louder to drown boos and the cries of small children whose parents are moaning it's getting past their bedtime." [...] The show opens with [...] "Baby Boy" [...] which Beyoncé sang while being lowered onto the stage upside down. A highlight for many fans was her performance of [...] "Dangerously in Love 2". During the tour, a special 8-minutes rendition of the song was performed.|$|E
500|$|The {{thematic}} {{content of}} heavy metal {{has long been}} a target of criticism. According to Jon Pareles, [...] "Heavy metal's main subject matter is simple and virtually universal. With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates... a party without limits... he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic." [...] Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal, and others have objected to what they see as advocacy of misogyny and the occult. During the 1980s, the Parents Music Resource Center petitioned the U.S. Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics, particularly those in heavy metal songs. Andrew Cope states that claims that heavy metal lyrics are misogynistic are [...] "clearly misguided" [...] as these critics have [...] "overlook the overwhelming evidence that suggests otherwise." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau called metal [...] "an expressive mode [...] it sometimes seems will <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> for as long as ordinary white boys fear girls, pity themselves, and are permitted to rage against a world they'll never beat".|$|E

[...] He never again left his Washington residence, having fallen ill with typhoid fever. [...] As the days passed, politicians began {{to wait in the}} Arlington lobby, close to Hanna's house, for news; a letter from the President, [...] "May you soon <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> old fellow, as strong in body and as vigorous in your leadership as ever" [...] was never read by the recipient. [...] Hanna drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} for several days; on the morning of February 15, his heart began to fail. [...] Roosevelt visited at 3pm, unseen by the dying man. [...] At 6:30pm, Senator Hanna died, and the crowd of congressional colleagues, government officials, and diplomats who had gathered in the lobby of the Arlington left the hotel, many sobbing. [...] Roosevelt biographer Edmund Morris noted Hanna's achievement in industry and in politics, [...] "He had not done badly in either field; he had made seven million dollars, and a President of the United States." ...|$|E

500|$|Johnson's move to Austin Aztex was {{finalised}} in March {{and completed}} their initial starting side, which included fellow English players Alex Tapp and Gifton Noel-Williams and Welshman Gareth Evans. Upon Johnson's transfer, team manager Adrian Heath said: [...] "I think it's {{fair to say}} that Eddie has lost his way recently and I hope we can get him back on the right path to where he is again one of the bright young players in English football." [...] Johnson played in the club's first game, which was a 2–0 friendly defeat to Major League Soccer's New England Revolution and scored in another pre-season match. Johnson scored his first goal for Austin on 25 April against fellow expansion side the Cleveland City Stars when he scored in the 13th minute of play. Johnson scored his second goal in the final minute of the match. In the 2009 season, Johnson played 22 league matches, scoring five goals making him the Aztex leading goalscorer, but he was forced to miss part of the season because of work permit problems after he returned to England with Evans. Johnson also played in two of the Aztex's three US Open Cup matches, playing in the first round, scoring the second goal in a 2–0 win over Mississippi Brilla and in Austin's 2–0 defeat to Houston Dynamo in the third round. The Austin Chronicle named Johnson the city's best player. The newspaper's citation said: [...] "he's been out there hustling every game and providing leadership and a steadying influence on and off the field. At 24, with a background that includes Manchester United and English national youth teams, he might not <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> much longer, but it's a treat while it lasts." [...] He went on to win one of the club's player of the season awards.|$|E

He was also awarded the Belgian Order of the Crown (LG 29 Aug 1917), and in the New Year's Honours for 1919 {{he was awarded the}} AFC, [...] "in recognition of distinguished service" [...] (LG 1 Jan 1919).|$|E

2500|$|William Tyndale, an English Protestant reformer, {{held that}} while the Roman Catholic realms of that age were the empire of Antichrist, any {{religious}} organization that distorted {{the doctrine of the}} Old and New Testaments also showed the work of Antichrist.

Tyndale's translation of 2 Thessalonians, chapter 2, concerning the [...] "man of lawlessness" [...] reflected his understanding, but was significantly amended by later revisers, including the King James Bible translation committees, which followed the Vulgate more closely.|$|E
