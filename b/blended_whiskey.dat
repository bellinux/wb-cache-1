25|$|Popular {{everyday}} beverages {{among the}} Irish include tea and coffee. Alcoholic drinks associated with Ireland include Poitín and the world-famous Guinness, {{which is a}} dry stout that originated in the brewery of Arthur Guinness at St. James's Gate in Dublin. Irish whiskey is also popular throughout the country, and comes in various forms, including single malt, single grain and <b>blended</b> <b>whiskey.</b>|$|E
25|$|Irish whiskeys are {{normally}} distilled three times, Cooley Distillery being the exception as they also double distill. Though traditionally distilled using pot stills, the column still is now {{used to produce}} grain whiskey for blends. By law, Irish whiskey must be produced in Ireland and aged in wooden casks {{for a period of}} no less than three years, although in practice it is usually three or four times that period. Unpeated malt is almost always used, the main exception being Connemara Peated Malt whiskey. There are several types of whiskey common to Ireland: single malt, single grain, <b>blended</b> <b>whiskey</b> and pure pot still whiskey.|$|E

50|$|However, {{straight}} whiskey {{is also an}} important component of American <b>blended</b> <b>whiskey.</b> <b>Blended</b> <b>whiskey</b> made in the United States must contain at least 20% {{straight whiskey}}. The remaining portion is higher-proof spirit, often unaged neutral grain spirits, which are less expensive to produce. The straight whiskey component adds characteristic whiskey flavor to the blend, as the higher proof spirit loses most flavoring compounds during the distillation process, and does not gain flavors from barrel aging. <b>Blended</b> <b>whiskey</b> may also contain additives for coloring and flavoring.|$|E

50|$|In 1961, a Coffey {{still was}} {{installed}} in John's Lane Distillery, allowing the production of vodka and gin, {{in addition to the}} testing of grain whiskey for use in <b>blended</b> <b>whiskey.</b> This was a notable departure for the firm, as for many years the big Dublin distilling dynasties had shunned the use of Coffey stills, questioning if their output, grain whiskey could even be termed whiskey. However, with many of the Irish distilleries having closed in early 20th century in part due to their failure to embrace a change in consumer preference towards <b>blended</b> <b>whiskey,</b> Powers were instrumental in convincing the remaining Irish distilleries to reconsider their stance on <b>blended</b> <b>whiskey.</b>|$|E

5000|$|There is no aging {{requirement}} {{under the}} U.S. Code of Federal Regulations for American whiskey for the neutral grain spirits in an American <b>blended</b> <b>whiskey,</b> {{although there is}} a 2-year minimum aging requirement for straight whiskey (and for the straight whiskey used in the mixture from which a <b>blended</b> <b>whiskey</b> is formulated) and there is a requirement for an age statement on the label of a <b>blended</b> <b>whiskey</b> containing neutral spirits in cases where the straight whiskey used in the blend is less than 4 years old. A labeling age statement on American <b>blended</b> <b>whiskey</b> that contains neutral spirits (per Title 27, Part 5, Subpart C, Section 5.40) ordinarily refers only to the age of the 20% content of the product that is the straight whiskey used within the blend, and the neutral grain spirits used in the blend may not have been aged. The company web site for Old Thompson refers to it as [...] "4 Year Old Blended American Whiskey", and the picture of the label itself on the web site does not show an age statement, so Old Thompson is formulated from 20% 4 year old straight whiskey and 80% (un-aged) neutral spirits.|$|E
