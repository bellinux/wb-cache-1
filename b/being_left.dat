He also clashed with the Fiji Rugby Union over <b>being</b> <b>left</b> out of player {{selection}} duties. As a result, he was dismissed on 29 January 2009. Iliesa Tanivula took over the post {{for the rest of the}} series.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of Highbury was {{restricted}} because the East Stand had been {{designated as a}} Grade II listed building {{and the other three}} stands were close to residential properties. These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of <b>being</b> <b>left</b> behind in the football boom of that time.|$|E
5|$|In {{his third}} and final season with the Red Army, Bure tied for the lead in team-scoring with Valeri Kamensky, {{tallying}} 46 points. His 35 goals was second in the league, one goal behind Ramil Yuldashev of Sokil Kyiv. Bure turned down a three-year contract extension in August 1991, which resulted in him <b>being</b> <b>left</b> off the roster of the Soviet team for the Canada Cup.|$|E

5|$|After {{originally}} <b>being</b> <b>left</b> out the squad, he {{was given}} a last-minute call-up to play at the Toulon Tournament in May 2002, after Stephen Bywater was called up for the under-21 team. Howarth did not play in the first group match against Poland on 10 May 2002 as Bywater started, but in the second match against Portugal he was chosen ahead of Evans in a 1–0 victory over Portugal on 12 May. However, he was dropped for the final group match against Brazil on 14 May 2002 to make way for Evans, who also played in England's final match in the tournament against Japan on 17 May.|$|E

5|$|During David Dacko's {{presidency}} from 1960 to 1966, {{there was}} {{a significant increase in the}} production of diamonds. This occurred when the monopoly of the French concessionary companies was ended with a law allowing local citizens to dig for diamonds. After Dacko set up a diamond cutting factory at Bangui, diamonds became the country's leading export. But by the end of his five year's tenure, rampant corruption and financial indiscipline had resulted in workers <b>being</b> <b>left</b> unpaid and civil unrest ensued. Bokassa then seized power in a military coup in 1966.|$|E

50|$|Rousseau {{claimed that}} the state of nature was a {{primitive}} condition without law or morality, which human <b>beings</b> <b>left</b> for the benefits and necessity of cooperation. As society developed, the division of labor and private property required the human race to adopt institutions of law. In the degenerate phase of society, man is prone to be in frequent competition with his fellow men while also becoming increasingly dependent on them. This double pressure threatens both his survival and his freedom.|$|R
5|$|Finding the {{financial}} demands of his Maidstone seat too much, Disraeli secured a Tory nomination for Shrewsbury, winning {{one of the}} constituency's two seats at the 1841 general election, despite serious opposition, and heavy debts which opponents seized on. The election was a massive defeat for the Whigs across the country, and Peel became Prime Minister. Disraeli hoped, unrealistically, for ministerial office. Though disappointed at <b>being</b> <b>left</b> on the back benches, he continued his support for Peel in 1842 and 1843, seeking to establish himself as an expert on foreign affairs and international trade.|$|E

5|$|Meredith {{signed for}} League Two team Shrewsbury Town on 14 January 2008 on a one-and-a-half-year {{contract}} after training with the club, {{which included a}} clause that after making five appearances the contract could be renegotiated. He made his debut on 23 February 2008 in the 2–1 home defeat to Hereford United, finishing the 2007–08 season with three appearances, with his final match coming against Rochdale {{on the last day}} of the season. He was told that he did not figure in new manager Paul Simpson's immediate plans in July 2008, <b>being</b> <b>left</b> behind as the club travelled to Spain on a pre-season training camp.|$|E
5|$|Mills' signings for 2012–13 {{proved to}} be less {{influential}} than his signings the previous summer, {{a number of new}} players <b>being</b> <b>left</b> out of the team with little playing time. York were in midtable for most {{of the first half of}} the season, and his signings in the winter transfer window had little impact on the team. Having been 14th in the table on 1 January 2013, York went on a run of 11 matches without a win, and this left the team four points above the relegation zone in 18th place. Mills was dismissed by York on 2 March 2013, an hour after the last of these matches, a 2–0 defeat at home to Bradford City.|$|E

5|$|Pre-game media {{coverage}} of the game focused on Auburn <b>being</b> <b>left</b> out of the national championship game, a point of controversy for Auburn fans in {{the weeks leading up to}} the game. Much was made of that and the success of Auburn running backs Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown, each of whom was considered among the best at his position. On the Virginia Tech side, senior quarterback Bryan Randall had a record-breaking season. Both teams also had high-ranked defenses, and Tech's appearance in the 2000 Sugar Bowl also was mentioned in the run-up to the game.|$|E
5|$|Regehr {{struggled}} in 2001–02, finishing {{with a team}} worst −24 plus/minus while occasionally <b>being</b> <b>left</b> out of the lineup as a healthy scratch. Unhappy with his season, he focused on improving his game. He overcame rib, abdominal and wrist injuries in 2002–03 to establish himself as a top defender with the team and earned a second Masterton Trophy nomination for his dedication. The Flames rewarded him with a five-year contract extension prior to the 2003–04 season. They also named him an alternate captain, a position he continuously held {{for the remainder of}} his stay in Calgary.|$|E
