In episode 194 of the podcast Security Now! Gibson {{said that he could}} [...] "see absolutely no possible benefit to running SpinRite on a solid-state drive" [...] and later [...] "SpinRite is all about mechanics and magnetics, neither of which exist, by design, in an SSD". In episode 338 Gibson clarified [...] "it is actually detrimental because drives don't like to be written", but also pointing out that a read-only run could be beneficial: [...] "SpinRite's Level 1 is a read-only scan, and doing that on an SSD makes a lot of sense. Do a read-only scan of an SSD, it'll show the SSD's controller that it's got a problem reading a sector, and then it'll map that out or rewrite it in order to strengthen that sector, if possible. So that ends up <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>value</b> for SpinRite on solid-state drives."

30|$|The {{analyses}} {{of compassion and}} hating evil revealed that the instantiation of values {{is not only a}} matter of the relation, the relata, and the context, but also of the higher-order property of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>value.</b> The property of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>value</b> is a second-order property, instantiable by first-order properties and relations. As was suggested, there are properties and relations that may instantiate the property of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>value</b> to various degrees or intensity. Moreover, certain properties and relations may instantiate both the property of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>value</b> and of being a disvalue. Thus, it is possible to argue that whereas love is a pure value, enjoyment is perhaps not entirely such; pain and suffering are overwhelmingly disvalues, but may take on value aspects as well 22. More ambiguous value properties and relations include ‘originality, ‘provocativeness’ as well as ‘competes with’ or ‘is excited by 23.’ The ambiguity results from the ontological fact that the property of being a value/disvalue does not fully saturate, so to speak, the respective properties or relations.|$|E
30|$|The {{problem of}} how some {{universals}} instantiate the supposedly higher-order universal of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>value,</b> is insertable to such a conception, too. For instance, universals such as beauty or politeness are usually considered values, whereas redness or being a cube are not. But there also are many universals that look ambiguous. Think of originality, novelty, awesomeness, prestige, provocativeness, or curiosity. They are surely values to some extent, or in some sense, but not as unambiguously or thoroughly as beauty or love. If such graduality is possible among value universals, then {{the implication is that}} <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>value</b> is a higher-order property of various universals that is instantiated to various degrees by various universals. Beauty is a value-property all the way through, it may called a pure value universal. Novelty is a value property, or probably a value relation, which is not a pure value universal, since only in virtue of the novelty of something we do not usually attach great value to it, but it does confer some value to most things. Such universals seem to instantiate the universal of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>value</b> to a lesser extent. They are not only values, so it appears. Nevertheless, the instantiation of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>value</b> by another universal is to be explained in terms of instantiation 3.|$|E
30|$|In {{many cases}} {{we feel that}} the {{uniqueness}} or irreplaceability of the particular that instantiates various values as well as the supervening property of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>value</b> confers a special value to it. This is a challenge to the explanation given here for the instantiation of values, since if some value supervenes on a particular’s being unique then not all values are universals. This would shake the grounds of the present conception which presupposes that all values are universals (and that there are higher order universals, including the one of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>value).</b> Let us face this challenge.|$|E
