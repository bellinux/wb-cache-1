40|$|Welding {{deformation}} {{reduces the}} dimensional accuracy of ship hull blocks and decreases productivity {{due to the}} correction work. Prediction and minimizing of welding distortion {{at the design stage}} will lead to higher quality as well as higher productivity. Therefore, it is strongly required to develop an effective method to accurately predict the weld distortion of hull blocks considering the fabrication sequences. In the case of hull <b>block</b> <b>welding</b> work in shipyard, the welding process of curved stiffened plate has large amounts of workload. This paper suggests an efficient method for predicting the welding deformation of stiffened curved plates based on the inherent strain theory combined with the finite element method. The equivalent load was determined by integrating inherent strain components which are calculated in the vicinity of heat affected zone using the highest temperature and the degree of restraint. The welding distortion of curved stiffened panels under equivalent load are calculated by elastic analysis and compared with that by intensive elasto-plastic finite element analysis. It is verified that the proposed method has a high efficiency and accuracy. Keywords: Welding deformation; Curved stiffened plate; Inheren...|$|E

Methods/Statistical Analysis: The material of the artificial defect block is carbon steel (S 45 C) with dimension of 180 mm (length) × 25 mm (width) × 60 mm (height). There are eight artificial defects which located 20 mm parallel to the length of the block with 0. 5 mm diameter.

The optimum of eddy current testing frequency for carbon steel S 45 C is depending on the defect distance from the material surface.

A general consensus has been reached that the North Kunlun Block is part of the Tarim Craton, but hot debate exists on the nature and origin of the South Kunlun. Samples were collected from the 471 Ma Yirba Pluton, the 405 Ma North Kudi Pluton (NKP) and the 214 Ma Arkarz Shan Intrusive Complex (ASIC), representing > 60 % of the Kudi area, the South Kunlun Block. Their Sr and O isotope compositions exclude significant involvement of mantle-derived magma in the genesis of the granitoids; therefore the granitoids can be used to decipher the nature of lower/mid crust in the area. All the samples give Mesoproterozoic Nd model ages (1. 1 - 1. 5 Ga), similar to those for the exposed metamorphic complex in the area. This indicates that the South Kunlun Block does not have an Archean basement, therefore this block cannot be a micro-continent once separated from the North Kunlun Block, as previously suggested.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} new set of brittle microtectonic {{measurements}} carried out in the Pliocene and Quaternary rocks outcropping in several key sectors of the western Betic and Rif orogen, the so-called Gibraltar orogenic arc. This data set, along with available earthquake focal mechanisms and borehole breakouts, allowed us to compile the Pliocene and Quaternary stress map of this area. This map provides new constraints for tectonic models and the present-day tectonic activity of the proposed active eastward subduction of oceanic lithosphere beneath the Gibraltar Arc and roll-back. The horizontal maximum compressive stress (S-Hmax) is NW-SE in the Betic Orogen and N-S/NNW-SSE in the southern Rif Cordillera. There is a significant consistency between S-Hmax and the displacement field deduced from GPS measurements with respect to the African plate: both appear to reflect the NW-SE convergence between the African and the European plates that is perturbed in the Rif. We propose that part of the eastern Rif behaves as a quasi-rigid <b>block</b> <b>welded</b> to the stable African plate. This block is bounded by important faults that localized most of the deformation disturbing the stress and surface displacement field. Pliocene to Quaternary N-S to NW-SE Africa-Europe plate convergence seem to be associated to the reorganization of the remnant Early Miocene subduction system in a continental-continental collision framework. Three-dimensional reconstruction of available seismic tomography plotted against the intermediate seismicity shows that only part of the old subduction system, whose orientation ranges from N 20 degrees E to N 100 degrees E, remains active: the portion ranging from N 30 degrees E to N 40 degrees E, orthogonal to the regional convergence.

40|$|Coarse-grained {{engineering}} materials exhibiting heterogeneous and anisotropic microstructure {{are used}} extensively in many industrial sectors. Inspecting such materials using ultrasound suffers from backscattered signals from grain boundaries resulting in strong speckle noise, which reduces image contrast and increases difficulty in image interpretation. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to adaptively compound images which are acquired in different frequency channels (FC), {{in order to}} remove or minimize speckle. Most existing image compounding algorithms are point-wise and based on order statistics estimation, which implicitly assume speckle is spatially and spectrally uncorrelated, leading to limited success in speckle suppression. The proposed method applies spatially variant weightings which are calculated to account for both spatial correlation and inter-FC correlation of speckle noise and flaw echo signals. To validate this method, experiments on two highly scattering samples were conducted: an Inconel 625 block with two side-drilled holes and a steel <b>weld</b> <b>block</b> with an implanted tilted flaw, simulating lack of fusion. Speckle point {{was found to be}} less spatially and spectrally correlated than flaw echo, yielding smaller compounding output.

Traditional MSE {{walls are}} constructed of large reinforced concrete panels bolted to steel strips for soil reinforcement. Segmented Retaining Walls (SRWs) are {{a form of}} MSE walls composed of precast concrete modular blocks that incorporate geosynthetic soil reinforcement. In comparison, traditional MSE walls have faster construction times and are typically stronger, but SRWs have increased in popularity because they are much cheaper to build. There are many precast companies that produce different SRW block designs, these blocks have facing areas that range from 1 to 13. 75 sq. ft. and can weigh approximately 90 to 2, 000 lbs. There are advantages to both block types {{that must be addressed}} during design. Typically construction costs are lower for small blocks because they can be placed by hand rather than using equipment. Large blocks require less construction time but are usually more expensive to fabricate. Oldcastle is a precast company that has several modular block designs. The newest model called the Mega Wall block is 5. 5 feet wide, 2. 5 feet tall and weighs approximately 2, 000 lbs. The block is designed to accommodate both welded wire mesh and geosynthetics soil reinforcement. Prior to being released to the market design strengths must be determined through laboratory testing. This report presents the results of the Mega Wall <b>block</b> <b>welded</b> wire mesh connection capacity. Three tests were performed by pulling the welded wire mesh to failure under simulated overburden pressures. Results of the testing show that welds in the wire mesh failed well below the yield strength of the steel. As the wires were pulled, the mesh applied stress concentrations to edges of the concrete grooves. Conical concrete failures were observed in the concrete after each test. After the concrete failed, the mesh was allowed to bend considerably, which began to apply a bending to the welds already experiencing shear stress. This excessive bending deformation caused premature failure in the welds during testing. In order to achieve higher connection capacities, several modifications to the Mega Wall block design were presented to Oldcastle. These suggestions were acknowledged but not implemented. Oldcastle was not interested in testing modifications to the block and testing was terminated. It is assumed that the Mega Wall block design will not be modified and that Oldcastle will not recommend using the welded wire mesh connection...|$|R

In fact, the finite lateral extent of surface layers such as lava flows, <b>blocks,</b> differential <b>welding</b> and/or zeolitization within pyroclastic deposits, introduces in the propagation of seismic waves effects such as the generation of surface waves at the edge, resonance in lateral direction, diffractions and scattering of energy, which tend to modify the amplitude {{as well as the}} duration of the ground motion. The irregular topographic surface, typical of volcanic areas, also strongly influences the seismic site response. Despite this heterogeneity, it is unfortunately a common geophysical and engineering practice to evaluate even in volcanic environments the subsurface velocity field with monodimensional investigation method (i. e. geognostic soundings, refraction survey, down-hole, etc.) prior to the seismic site response computation which in a such cases is obviously also made with 1 D algorithms. This approach often leads to highly inaccurate results.

As {{part of an ongoing}} effort to evaluate thermal-hydrologic-chemical (THC) effects on flow in fractured media, we performed a laboratory experiment and numerical simulations to investigate mineral dissolution and precipitation under anticipated temperature and pressure conditions in the repository. To replicate mineral dissolution by vapor condensate in fractured tuff, water was flowed through crushed Yucca Mountain tuff at 94 C. The resulting steady-state fluid composition had a total dissolved solids content of about 140 mg/L; silica was the dominant dissolved constituent. A portion of the steady-state mineralized water was flowed into a vertically oriented planar fracture in a <b>block</b> of <b>welded</b> Topopah Spring Tuff that was maintained at 80 C at the top and 130 C at the bottom. The fracture began to seal with amorphous silica within five days. A 1 -D plug-flow numerical model was used to simulate mineral dissolution, and a similar model was developed to simulate the flow of mineralized water through a planar fracture, where boiling conditions led to mineral precipitation. Predicted concentrations of the major dissolved constituents for the tuff dissolution were within a factor of 2 of the measured average steady-state compositions. The mineral precipitation simulations predicted the precipitation of amorphous silica {{at the base of the}} boiling front, leading to a greater than fifty-fold decrease in fracture permeability in 5 days, consistent with the laboratory experiment. These results help validate the use of a numerical model to simulate THC processes at Yucca Mountain. The experiment and simulations indicated that boiling and concomitant precipitation of amorphous silica could cause significant reductions in fracture porosity and permeability on a local scale. However, differences in fluid flow rates and thermal gradients between the experimental setup and anticipated conditions at Yucca Mountain need to be factored into scaling the results of the dissolution/precipitation experiments and associated simulations to THC models for the potential Yucca Mountain repository...|$|R

A new method is proposed, called 'diffraction subtraction', which modifies the scattering cross section of close-packed large, opaque spheres {{to account for the}} effect of close packing on the diffraction cross section of a scattering particle. This method predicts the thermal infrared reflectance of coarse (greater than 50 micrometers radius), disaggregated granular snow. However, such coarse snow is typically old and metamorphosed, with adjacent grains welded together. The reflectance of such a <b>welded</b> <b>block</b> can be described as partly Fresnel in nature and cannot be predicted using Mie inputs to radiative transfer theory. Owing to the high absorption coefficient of ice in the thermal infrared, a rough surface reflectance model can be used to calculate reflectance from such a block. For very small (less than 50 micrometers), disaggregated particles, it is incorrect in principle to treat diffraction independently of reflection and refraction, and the theory fails. However, for particles larger than 50 micrometers, independent scattering is a valid assumption, and standard radiative transfer theory works...|$|R
