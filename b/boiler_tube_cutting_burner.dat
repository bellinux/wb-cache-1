The need for the investigation arose from a single coal fired power station, with multiple boilers with a total generating capacity of greater than 400 MW, of which LTOC is the dominant <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failure mechanism. For {{the purposes of the}} mini-dissertation, the power station was simply titled Power Station X. A summary is provided of the various <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failure mechanisms as well as a brief description of availability. The mini-dissertation makes use of case studies in researching the matter of LTOC. It was seen that LTOC is a global matter, which is typically seen in ageing power stations. The major discussion points arising from the mini-dissertation is that of a <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failure management program as well as correctly understanding the causes of <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failures. With an adequate and correctly functioning <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failure management program one can reduce and manage the occurrence of <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failures.

This paper describes the joint international effort to develop faster and more efficient methods for condition assessment and remaining life prediction for <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes.</b> The work was performed under the grant from Kazakhstan Ministry of Education and Science. The authors have visited a number of coal-fired electric plants throughout Central Asia and found {{that a combination of}} wall thinning and overheating were major damage mechanisms contributing to <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failures. The periodic inspection of <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes</b> include ultrasonic measurement of remaining wall thickness and in many cases, it involves <b>cutting</b> <b>tube</b> segments and performing metallurgical analysis for loss of original strength due to overheating. Systematic research was undertaken with the objective to correlate the results of combined non-destructive testing (NDT) with condition assessment of <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes.</b> The evaluation included non-contact wall thickness measurement with EMAT technology plus internal oxide layer measurement with specialized ultrasonics. The first method shows the remaining tube wall thickness, thus allowing to calculate total stress, and the latter one has the potential to indirectly characterize microstructure degradation, which up to now could only be determined by destructive analysis. The existing tube removal criteria are treating each damage mechanism separately while in reality, a combined effect of wall thinning and the “degree of overheating” decides about true condition of a tube. The procedure that utilizes the results of both described NDT methods was developed for improved methodology to assess tube condition and to predict its remaining life...|$|R

Fire-side corrosion is caused by the reaction of combustion products with oxide layers on the tube surface resulting in metal loss and consequently tubes fracture. However, the tubes corrosion behaviour did not follow the conventional models of the fire-side corrosion.

In industrial <b>boilers,</b> most waterside <b>tube</b> cracks are found near heavy attachment welds on the outer surface and are typically blunt, with multiple bulbous features indicating a discontinuous growth. These types of tube failures are typically referred to as stress assisted corrosion (SAC). For recovery boilers in the pulp and paper industry, these failures are particularly important as any water leak inside the furnace can potentially lead to smelt-water explosion. Previous research shows that metal properties, environmental variables, and stress conditions are the major factors influencing SAC crack initiation and propagation in carbon steel <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes.</b> A significant volume of work has also been published to show that the use of carbon steel in high temperature water applications strongly depends upon the formation and stability of a protective magnetite oxide film on the waterside of <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes.</b> This present study is aimed at evaluating above stated variables individually and interactively to identify SAC crack initiation and crack propagation behavior in carbon steel <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes.</b> Other goal of this research is to understand the mechanism of bulbous SAC crack formation under industrial boiler operating conditions, thus to figure out a practical way to predict and prevent SAC type failures in the industrial boilers.
