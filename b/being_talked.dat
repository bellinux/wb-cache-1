5|$|In 1902, James Baker {{died at the}} age of 41, {{leaving an}} opening in the GCC. On this {{occasion}} Watts Morgan was permitted to advance as a Labour candidate and was returned unopposed. By 1903 he was <b>being</b> <b>talked</b> of as a possible candidate for a south Wales parliamentary constituency. He joined the South Wales Miners' Federation at its inception and by 1902 he was pushing for a greater political role for the organisation. By 1908 the Federation was making great headway in the Rhondda and was substantially improving conditions for the miners. At this time Watts Morgan was Agent and District Secretary at No.1 Rhondda District under William Abraham.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the {{possibility}} arose of his father's record of 257hits {{in a season}} being surpassed by Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners. Living in Dallas, Texas at the time, Sisler and his son Dave followed Ichiro's progress throughout the season. Both had mixed feelings about the record chase; they were happy that George Sisler's name was <b>being</b> <b>talked</b> about and that people were re-discovering him as a player, but both were hoping that, if the record was not broken in 154games, {{there would be an}} asterisk noting that it took Ichiro more games to achieve it. Ichiro finished the season with 262hits, and the Mariners extended an invitation for the entire Sisler family to attend the celebration at Safeco Field. The younger Sisler was prevented by an emergency heart procedure from travelling to Seattle. Both remarked that the Mariners were a classy organization for extending the invitation.|$|E

The first-person plural had a clusivity distinction, i.e. ನಾಂ - We (including person <b>being</b> <b>talked</b> to); ಎಂ - We (excluding person <b>being</b> <b>talked</b> to). There were three degrees of proximity distinction, usually shown by the three vowels: ಇ - proximate space; ಉ - intermediate space; ಅ - distant space.|$|E

25|$|A young Malton architect, John Gibson, {{designed}} the Crown Spa Hotel, Scarborough's first purpose-built hotel. In 1841 a railway link between York and Scarborough was <b>being</b> <b>talked</b> of {{and he decided}} that the area above the popular Spa building could be developed. He designed and laid the foundations before passing the construction of this hotel to the newly formed South Cliff Building Company. On Tuesday, 10 June 1845 Scarborough's first hotel was opened: a marketing coup, as the Grand Hotel, soon to be Europe's largest, was not yet finished.|$|E

5000|$|Brown {{draws upon}} social {{anthropologist}} Edmund Leach's idea of code-switching {{to explain how}} human beings create needs symbolically. Leach writes that human <b>beings</b> <b>talk</b> and act as if non-sensed or abstract concepts exist {{in the physical world}} (e.g., marriage, prosperity, recession), having [...] "forgotten" [...] that they symbolically constructed these concepts. They code switch, or act as if the non-sensed is now the sensed.|$|R
25|$|In 1960, Milburn {{signed for}} Northamptonshire because they offered 10 shillings a week more than Warwickshire. He soon {{made a name}} for himself with his {{forceful}} strokeplay and useful medium-paced bowling, backed up by a larger-than-life, gregarious and convivial personality. By 1963 he was <b>being</b> <b>talked</b> about for the England team, but an indifferent game for MCC against Frank Worrell's West Indians meant he was passed over. He also taught PE during the off season at Cherry Orchard SM School in Northampton, just about a mile from the site of his later accident.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{questions}} which taxed Bonar Law's brief government was that of inter-Allied war debts. Britain owed money to the USA, and in turn was owed {{four times as much}} money by France, Italy and the other Allied powers, although under the Lloyd George government Balfour had promised that Britain would collect no more money from other Allies than she was required to repay the USA; the debt was hard to repay as trade (exports were needed to earn foreign currency) had not returned to prewar levels. On a trip to the USA Stanley Baldwin, the inexperienced Chancellor of the Exchequer, agreed to repay £40million per annum to the USA rather than the £25million which the British government had thought feasible, and on his return announced the deal to the press when his ship docked at Southampton, before the Cabinet had had a chance to consider it. Bonar Law contemplated resignation, and after <b>being</b> <b>talked</b> out of it by senior ministers, once again vented his feelings in an anonymous letter to The Times.|$|E
50|$|De Biase {{was a very}} {{experienced}} train driver, who {{had been}} working for many years on the line. Most likely, according to the inquiry, he ignored the red signals since he had not received an advisory phone call. While fog may have been a factor, it was downplayed in the final inquiry response. Early hypotheses of his being under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or <b>being</b> <b>talking</b> on his cellphone, were dismissed after checks.|$|R

500|$|Madonna {{posted a}} {{newspaper}} clipping that featured {{the story on}} her Twitter and Instagram accounts, and thanked her fans for their support. In an interview with Wootton in The Sun, the singer called the omission [...] "unfair" [...] and [...] "discriminatory", and felt [...] that ageism was a taboo that is still not <b>being</b> <b>talked</b> about. She also recalled discussing the incident with her manager Guy Oseary and admitted that it was perplexing for her to learn that artists in their fifties do not get played on radio, without exceptions. [...] "We've made so many advances in other areas— civil rights, gay rights— but ageism is still an area that's taboo and not talked about and dealt with," [...] she concluded.|$|E
500|$|Within {{two months}} of the Bennettsville speech, Tillman was <b>being</b> <b>talked</b> of as a {{candidate}} for governor in 1886. He continued to speak to audiences, and was dubbed the [...] "Agricultural Moses". He made political demands, such as primary elections to determine who would get the Democratic nomination (then tantamount to election) rather than the leaving the decision to the Bourbon-dominated state nominating convention. He principally promoted the establishment of a state college for the education of farmers, where young men could learn the latest techniques. Kantrowitz pointed out that the term [...] "farmer" [...] is flexible in meaning, allowing Tillman to overlook distinctions of class and unite most white men in predominately rural South Carolina under a single banner. During these years, cartoonists began depicting Tillman with pitchfork in hand, symbolizing his agriculture-based roots and tendency to take jabs at opponents. This was a source of his nickname, [...] "Pitchfork Ben".|$|E

500|$|Gardiner {{joined the}} Chicago Black Hawks in the 1927–28 season. In {{his first season}} with the Black Hawks, Gardiner played in 40 out of 44 of Chicago's games.

Known as the NHL's [...] "goalless wonders", Chicago scored only 33goals the entire season, finishing with a 7–29–8 record. Gardiner posted five shutouts and a 1.85 goals against average that season. During {{a game against the}} New York Rangers on February 3, 1929 WJ Holmes, manager of the Maroons came to Chicago to watch Gardiner play. The Rangers won the game 3–2 though Gardiner played well. Even so, Frederic McLaughlin, owner of the Hawks, offered to sell him back to Winnipeg for $3500. Only after Barney Stanley and Hugh Lehman talked to McLaughlin did he back down on the deal. After being booed by the Chicago fans, Gardiner nearly retired, before <b>being</b> <b>talked</b> out of it by Duke Keats.|$|E
500|$|Lovato {{collaborated with}} Beckett on a song titled [...] "For the Love of a Daughter". Although not {{planning}} to write a personal song, a [...] "really long talk" [...] with Beckett resulted in the song being written.

In the song, she pleads with her father to [...] "put the bottle down" [...] and questions him: [...] "How could you {{put your hands on}} the ones that you swore you loved?" [...] The song was set to appear on the album, but Lovato and her management felt of the song's subject would be too much for her young audience and later was removed from the album. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, she explained: [...] "When I took a step back, I realized I wouldn't like those subjects <b>being</b> <b>talked</b> about in somebody else's home, with a seven-year-old and their mom." [...] Several other [...] "emotional" [...] songs were also put on hold. The song was later selected and included on her third studio album Unbroken released in September 2011, when Lovato had left Disney Channel.|$|E
