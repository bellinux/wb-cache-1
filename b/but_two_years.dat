5|$|It {{was founded}} as Tillingbourne Valley in 1924, {{and became a}} limited company in 1931, taking the name Tillingbourne Valley Services. It {{initially}} operated routes in the Guildford area from a garage in Chilworth using small single-deck buses painted in a maroon livery. Coach hire and excursions began in 1931, <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later these activities split into a separate company, Tillingbourne Valley Coaches, which operated independently for a further 24 years. Until 1970 Tillingbourne was owned and managed by three generations of the Trice family, before being sold to Trevor Brown.|$|E

5|$|The mosque was {{originally}} a small prayer house built by Umar the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, but was rebuilt and expanded by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik and finished {{by his son}} al-Walid in 705 CE. The mosque was completely destroyed by an earthquake in 746 and rebuilt by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur in 754. His successor al-Mahdi rebuilt it again in 780.

5|$|With {{her older}} sister, Elizabeth, Anne {{was sent to}} be raised at Güstrow in Germany by her {{maternal}} grandparents, the Duke and Duchess of Mecklenburg. Compared with the roving Danish court, where King Frederick was notorious for gargantuan meals, heavy drinking and restless behaviour (including marital infidelity), Güstrow provided Anne with a frugal and stable life during her early childhood. Christian was also sent to be brought up at Güstrow <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later, in 1579, the Rigsraad (Danish Privy Council) successfully requested his removal to Denmark, and Anne and Elizabeth returned with him.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{policy was}} put forward in 1923 by the Australian Labor Party, {{which was in}} opposition for all <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> of the 1920s and 1930s. It called for Australia's first line of defence {{to be a powerful}} air arm, supported by a well-equipped Australian Army that could be rapidly expanded to meet an invasion threat. This, in turn, required a strong munitions industry. Labor politicians cited critics like Rear Admiral William Freeland Fullam, who drew attention to the vulnerability of warships to aircraft, naval mines and submarines. The Labor Party's Albert Green noted in 1923 that when a battleship of the day cost £7,000,000 while an aircraft cost £2,500, there was a genuine cause for concern as to whether the battleship was a better investment than hundreds of aircraft, if the aircraft could sink battleships. The Labor Party's policy became indistinguishable from the Army's position.|$|E

5|$|Born in the Melbourne {{suburb of}} St Kilda on 8June 1919, Bill Newton was the {{youngest}} child of dentist Charles Ellis Newton and his second wife Minnie. His three older half-siblings from Charles' earlier marriage included two brothers, John and Lindsay, and a sister, Phyllis. Bill entered Melbourne Grammar School in 1929, <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later switched to the nearby St Kilda Park Central School as the family income was reduced through {{the impact of the}} Great Depression. In 1934, aged fifteen, he was able to return to Melbourne Grammar where, despite struggling with his schoolwork, he completed his Intermediate certificate. He gave up further study when his father died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of fifty-one, and began working in a silk warehouse.|$|E
5|$|Gulls are {{typically}} medium to large birds, usually gray or white, often with black markings {{on the head}} or wings. They have stout, stout, longish bills and webbed feet. The large species take up to four years to attain full adult plumage, <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> is typical for small gulls. Terns are in general medium to large birds, typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. They have longish bills and webbed feet. They are lighter bodied and more streamlined than gulls and look elegant in flight with long tails and long narrow wings. Skimmers are tropical and subtropical species. They have an elongated lower mandible. They feed by flying low over the water surface with the lower mandible skimming the water for small fish. Thirty-two species of Laridae have been recorded in North Carolina.|$|E

Terns are in general medium-to-large birds, typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. They have longish bills and webbed feet. They are lighter-bodied and more streamlined than gulls and look elegant in flight with long tails and long narrow wings. In Tasmania, thirteen species of gulls and terns have been recorded, five of which are vagrants. The two groups have been considered separate families, but some findings that the noddies and white tern are offshoots to the combined group have led the two to be classified as a single family for the time being.|$|E

5|$|The town {{is governed}} locally by a two-tier council system, {{being a part}} of both Lancashire County Council and Wyre Borough Council with both councils having {{different}} responsibilities for the area. Elections are held for Lancashire County Council every four years with elections to Wyre Borough Council also taking place every four years, <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> after the county elections. For borough elections Poulton contains four wards; Breck, Hardhorn, Highcross and Tithebarn. All four wards elect two councillors each to Wyre Borough Council. Poulton-le-Fylde is also a county division for the Lancashire County Council elections which is made up {{of the majority of the}} four wards and elects one councillor to the county council. At the most recent borough election in 2011 the town's four wards each elected two Conservative Party councillors, including the mayor of Wyre for 2011 David Bannister and the current leader of the council Peter Gibson.|$|E
5|$|Accommodation for {{students}} is {{primarily in the}} central precinct of the university and two areas of Bristol: Clifton and Stoke Bishop. In Stoke Bishop, Wills Hall {{on the edge of}} the Clifton Downs was the first to be opened, in 1929, by the then chancellor, Winston Churchill. Its original quadrangle layout has been expanded twice, in 1962 and 1990. Churchill Hall, named for the chancellor, followed in 1956, then Badock Hall in 1964. At the time of Badock Hall's establishment, some of the buildings were called Hiatt Baker Hall, <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later, Hiatt Baker moved to its own site and is now the largest hall in the university. The first self-catering hall in Stoke Bishop was University Hall, established in 1971 with expansion in 1992. The University's newest undergraduate residence, 33 Colston Street, was opened in the city centre in October 2011 after acquiring the property in 2009. The university established a partnership with Unite PLC in order provide accommodation due to increase in number of students accepted for entry for academic year 2012/2013. A£20 million project of expanding facilities of Hiatt Baker is to provide additional 327 places for undergraduate students in 2014. All of the main halls elect groups of students to the Junior Common Room to organise the halls social calendar for the next year. Residents of student houses, private accommodation and students living at home become members of Orbital– a society organising social events {{for students}} throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to various}} controversies, two extra gold medals were awarded. In the figure skating pairs competition, Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia were {{originally}} awarded the gold over Jamie Salé and David Pelletier of Canada. In the ensuing controversy, {{it was revealed}} that French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne had been pressured into voting for the Russians. Salé and Pelletier were later upgraded to gold. In the cross-country skiing 30 km race, Norwegians Thomas Alsgaard and Frode Estil originally tied for a silver medal behind Spain's Johann Muehlegg. Muehlegg had won three gold medals but tested positive for darbepoetin after winning his third. He was originally allowed to keep the other two gold medals, <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later was stripped of all medals by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Per Elofsson of Sweden was awarded the bronze. At the same time, Muehlegg was stripped of a gold medal in the 30km race, with Christian Hoffmann of Austria being upgraded to gold, Mikhail Botvinov of Austria to silver and Kristen Skjeldal of Norway to bronze. Muehlegg also lost his gold in the 50km race, so Mikhail Ivanov of Russia, Andrus Veerpalu of Estonia and Odd-Bjørn Hjelmeset of Norway were upgraded to gold, silver and bronze, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The city soon {{experienced}} {{its most}} dire fiscal crisis yet, {{due to the}} stagnant economy of the early 1970s, combined with the massive outflow of city residents to the suburbs. The system was already in decline; the subway had seen a 40% decrease in ridership since 1947, and a $200 million subsidy for the MTA {{as well as a}} 1952 fare increase had not been enough to pay for basic upkeep for the subway system, let alone fund massive expansion projects like the Second Avenue Subway. When plans were finalized in 1971, the subway had been proposed for completion by 1980, <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later, its completion date was forecast as 2000. In October 1974, the MTA chairman, David Yunich, announced that the completion of the line north of 42nd Street was pushed back to 1983 and the portion to the south in 1988. On December 13, 1974, New York City mayor Abraham Beame proposed a six-year transit construction program that would reallocate $5.1 billion of funding from the Second Avenue Line to complete new lines in Queens and to modernize the existing infrastructure, which was rapidly deteriorating and in dire need of repair. Beame issued a stop-work order for the line in September 1975, whereupon construction of the section between Second and Ninth Streets was halted, and no other funding was allocated to the line's construction. Besides the Chrystie Street Connection, only three sections of tunnel had been completed; these tunnels were sealed.|$|E
