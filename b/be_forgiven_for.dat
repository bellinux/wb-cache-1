5|$|When {{the game}} starts, Kratos has been serving the gods for ten years. He kills the Hydra {{on behalf of}} Poseidon, but he has grown tired of his service and suffering. He summons Athena, who states that if Kratos {{performs}} one final act—the murder of Ares—he will <b>be</b> <b>forgiven</b> <b>for</b> killing his family. Ares is waging war on the city of Athens out of hatred and jealousy of his sister Athena, who assigns Kratos to destroy Ares because Zeus has forbidden divine intervention. Athena guides Kratos to the war-torn Athens. After a strange encounter with a gravedigger who encourages him to continue his task, Kratos battles his way to Athens's oracle, finds her, and learns {{that the only way}} to defeat Ares is with Pandora's Box, a mythical artifact that grants the power to kill a god.|$|E

25|$|Liang faced Northern Ireland's Joe Swail in {{the last}} 16 of the tournament. In a humorous incident, Liang fluked a red after {{scattering}} the balls, but failed to notice {{and went back to}} his seat. To laughter, Swail pointed out his mistake and the referee called Liang back to the table. In the 23rd frame, Liang, with a 12–10 lead, prematurely celebrated winning after potting match ball, only to go on to lose the frame due to a snooker. Swail came back to level the match at 12–12. In the final frame, Liang made breaks of 34 and 30 early on. He missed the final yellow but snookered Swail, leaving the white in the jaws of the pocket. Liang played a safety and Swail snookered him behind the blue, but Liang failed to hit the ball and Swail had the white replaced. Liang then hit the yellow directly. This incident proved controversial as the referee replaced the white in the wrong position, giving Liang a better sight of the yellow. At the time, Swail nodded his assent to the referee, but in a post-match interview, complained and accused Liang of unprofessional behaviour for not pointing out the referee's error. Commentators countered that Swail should have queried the placement of the ball before Liang took his shot, and given the tension of the situation Liang could <b>be</b> <b>forgiven</b> <b>for</b> not thinking clearly. Liang {{went on to win the}} frame 74–34, and thus, the match 13–12.|$|E

His secretary Traudl Junge stated that during the war, Hitler telephoned Braun every day. He was concerned for her safety when she was staying in the Munich home he had bought her. Junge further asked Hitler once why he never married. Hitler replied, [...] "...I wouldn't have been able to give enough time to my wife". Hitler told her that he didn't want children, as they would have had [...] "...a very hard time, because they're expected to possess the same gifts as their famous parents and they can't <b>be</b> <b>forgiven</b> <b>for</b> being mediocre". In the end, Hitler and Braun married in the Berlin Führerbunker in late April 1945, less than 40 hours before committing suicide together.|$|E

The game is presented in isometric view, and the player interacts with the environment to find hidden passages as Ida progresses to the map's exit. Each of the ten levels has a different central mechanic. Interactions include moving platforms and pillars, and creating bridges. The player is indirectly cued through the game by design elements like color, and directly cued by crow people, who block Ida's path. Critics compared the game's visual style to a vibrant M. C. Escher drawing and Echochrome. The game includes a camera mode where the player can roam the level to compose screenshots. It includes filters similar to those of Instagram.|$|E

500|$|L'Estrange {{began using}} the moniker [...] "the Australian Blondin" [...] from early 1876. Arriving in Sydney from Melbourne, L'Estrange erected a large canvas {{enclosure}} in The Domain {{and began a}} regular series of performances on the tightrope, copying the location and stunts of the real Blondin who had performed there in August 1874. His opening night on 26 January 1877 attracted a reported crowd of between two and three thousand people. Newspaper reports commented that his performance was so {{like that of the}} original Blondin that people could <b>be</b> <b>forgiven</b> <b>for</b> thinking they had seen the world-renowned rope-walker. With his rope suspended 40 feet (12 metres) above the ground, L'Estrange walked backwards and forwards, walked in armour, walked covered in a sack, used and sat on a chair, cooked and rode a bicycle, all on the rope. His show also included a fireworks display for the public's entertainment.|$|E
500|$|As Fanny {{was only}} weeks away from giving birth Kent made {{arrangements}} {{to move to}} a property at Bartlet's Court in Clerkenwell, but by January 1760 it was not ready and so they moved instead to an [...] "inconvenient" [...] apartment nearby, intending only a temporary stay. [...] However, on 25January Fanny fell ill. [...] The attending doctor diagnosed the early stages of an eruptive fever and agreed with Kent that their lodgings were inadequate for someone at so critical a stage of pregnancy. [...] Fanny was therefore moved, by coach, to Bartlet's Court. [...] The next day her doctor returned and met with her apothecary. [...] Both agreed that Fanny's symptoms were indicative of smallpox. [...] On hearing this, Fanny sent for an attorney, to ensure the will she had had made was in good order, and that Kent would inherit her estate. [...] An acquaintance of Kent's, Stephen Aldrich, Rector of St John Clerkenwell, reassured her that she would <b>be</b> <b>forgiven</b> <b>for</b> her sins. [...] She died on 2February.|$|E

[...] Beresford also noted Armitage's performance, although this was only his second appearance, [...] "Armitage looks and sounds like he's been here all along." [...] Greg O'Keefe of the Liverpool Echo, who also reviewed the first episode, as both episodes are considered a two-part story, stated it was [...] "packed with great action sequences, razor-sharp writing and the usual quota of twists and turns.

[...] The 1987 tribute song [...] "Alex Chilton", co-written by three members of the Replacements, was released as a single from the album Pleased to Meet Me and contains the lyric [...] "I never travel far without a little Big Star." [...] "I'm In Love With A Girl" [...] from Radio City features in the soundtrack of the 2009 film Adventureland. In 1998, an ad hoc, shortened version of #1 Records [...] "In the Street" [...] (recorded by Todd Griffin) was used as the theme song for the sitcom That '70s Show, and in 1999, a new version titled [...] "That '70s Song (In the Street)" [...] was recorded by Cheap Trick also specifically for the show.

500|$|On 13 August, after {{sighting}} a small patrol boat, three abandoned merchant {{ships were}} passed, {{some of them}} close by with boats showing flares. The convoy was sighted early in the morning, with the destroyer leading the tanker in astern of the line. The destroyer then informed the Convoy Commander of the tanker's condition. Torpedo planes flew in to distract attention from Junkers 88s which were coming in from a height. The convoy had detected these by R.D.F but could not sight them and the escorts were slow in opening fire on them. [...] was hit, probably by {{about three or four}} bombs, and blew up with a tremendous explosion leaving [...] "a great pylon of flame on the sea". Ashanti signalled Ledbury to pick up survivors. The destroyer went to the scene, but it was originally thought impossible that anyone could survive such a terrific explosion and mass of flames, but on approaching, men were seen in the water. The destroyer entered the inferno, and after manoeuvring around the debris field the destroyer picked up forty-four survivors, and one body was buried that evening with military honours. Some time later it was discovered that Ledbury had on board survivors from both Waimarama and Melbourne Star. This happened because when Waimarama blew up it happened so suddenly that Melbourne Star passed right through the flames. Those aft on board Melbourne Star thought that their own ship had gone up and had jumped over the side. By half past-nine Ledbury had completed the recovery of survivors. By this time the Commander estimated that the destroyer was about thirty miles astern of the convoy, which meant that they had to speed up in order to reach the ships. Captain Hill then sent a message to Admiral Burrough, 'Interrogative STOP rejoin or go home'. When the signal rating brought in Burrough's reply it became apparent that the signal groups had been received corruptly, since the admiral was apparently ordering Ledbury to [...] "proceed to the Orkney and Shetland Islands". After considering the signal, Captain Hill assumed that it plainly intended the destroyer to return to Gibraltar, however that he might <b>be</b> <b>forgiven</b> <b>for</b> not interpreting it correctly, and so Ledbury ignored the signal and set course for Ohio.|$|E
