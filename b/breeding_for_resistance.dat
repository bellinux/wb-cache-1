50|$|<b>Breeding</b> <b>for</b> <b>resistance</b> {{to other}} {{diseases}} such as beet yellows virus without also selecting for vascular necrosis resistance can leave cultivars susceptible to the pathogen. For example, the use of USH9A and H9B in California’s San Joaquin valley {{is thought to have}} led to an epiphytotic (severe) outbreak of disease in the early 1970s.

50|$|<b>Breeding</b> <b>for</b> <b>resistance,</b> {{particularly}} in potato, has had limited success {{in part due}} to difficulties in crossing cultivated potato to its wild relatives, which are the source of potential resistance genes. In addition, most resistance genes only work against a subset of P. infestans isolates, since effective plant disease resistance only results when the pathogen expresses a RXLR effector gene that matches the corresponding plant resistance (R) gene; effector-R gene interactions trigger a range of plant defenses, such as the production of compounds toxic to the pathogen.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Breeding</b> <b>for</b> <b>resistance</b> is {{important}} for fighting butternut canker.

The disease has now been found in virtually all parts of the butternut range. Additionally, it is suggested that [...] "removing diseased trees" [...] is a guarantee that infected, but not dying trees, i.e. those that are specifically [...] "partially resistant" [...] to the fungus, will be killed; eliminating any chance of increased resistance in progeny. Instances are known of long-term survival of pure butternuts infected by the canker.|$|E

Vesicatoria, group B is found in X. vesicatoria, and group D is found in X. gardeneri. Some of the strains have as little as 70% of their DNA in common which makes <b>breeding</b> <b>for</b> <b>resistance</b> extremely difficult.

50|$|Currently, {{the most}} {{effective}} treatments used to control the spread of TYLCV are insecticides and resistant crop varieties. The effectiveness of insecticides is not optimal in tropical areas due to whitefly resistance against the insecticides; therefore, insecticides should be alternated or mixed to provide {{the most effective}} treatment against virus transmission. Developing countries experience the most significant losses due to TYLCV infections due to the warm climate {{as well as the}} expensive costs of insecticides used as the control strategy. Other methods to control the spread of TYLCV include planting resistant/tolerant lines, crop rotation, and <b>breeding</b> <b>for</b> <b>resistance</b> of TYLCV. As with many other plant viruses, {{one of the most promising}} methods to control TYLCV is the production of transgenic tomato plants resistant to TYLCV.|$|E
5000|$|Cultural {{practices}} {{not only}} {{reduce the incidence}} of disease but also allow for better use of chemical control. [...] If the disease is not causing much damage, cultural control alone may be sufficient. Choosing a resistant variety of plant is an effective method of minimizing the damage of P. megakarya. <b>Breeding</b> <b>for</b> <b>resistance</b> for either P. palmivora or P. megakarya will increase the plant's resistance to both pathogens simultaneously. Removal of infected plant parts reduces sporangial inoculum and is an effective cultural control. Weeding reduces the humidity of the surrounding air which is unfavorable for the production of sporangia. Frequently harvesting the pods reduces the amount of sporangial inoculum. Another form of cultural control is the burning of the pod husk piles to destroy additional sources of chlamydospores and sporangia. These cultural practices can limit disease caused by P. megakarya significantly.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{effective}} management technique available to farmers {{is the use}} of disease-resistant cultivars. Resistant cultivars have been identified in alfalfa, bean, pea and red clover. <b>Breeding</b> <b>for</b> <b>resistance</b> has been successful in alfalfa and beans, however in beans it has been difficult to establish resistant cultivars that also meet consumer needs. [...] The efficacy of chemical suppression is dependent on environmental factors such as temperature and soil moisture. [...] Before widespread fungicide use was available, control consisted mainly of avoiding fields with high disease risk based on a procedure developed in 1958. [...] Management practices should also include good soil drainage and soil testing to avoid infested fields. Crop rotation can be implemented to slow the rate of build-up of A. euteiches, however because oospores can survive for up to 20 years in the soil, rotation is not an effective means of eradicating the inoculum. Therefore, once high levels of A. euteiches have been identified in a field, growers should abstain from planting susceptible hosts in that field.|$|E
50|$|Control {{strategies}} are elimination of reservoir species, vector control, mild strain protection and <b>breeding</b> <b>for</b> host <b>resistance.</b> Eradication of diseased plants is usually performed to minimize spread but is of dubious efficacy {{due to the}} difficulties of early diagnosis as the virus etiology remains unknown and the one discovered are the three main stages in the disease development.|$|R

The only known host in Portugal is the maritime pine, Pinus pinaster. One of the strategies to control this disease is the establishment of resistant hosts.

The results confirmed the existence of variability in response of the tested families, the effects of plant height and stem diameter, and the effects of the different inoculum concentrations applied in this study.
