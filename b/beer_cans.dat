5|$|They {{arrived at}} the Andrew Johnson Hotel in Knoxville, Tennessee, where Carr {{requested}} a doctor for Williams, as he was feeling {{the combination of the}} chloral hydrate and alcohol he had drunk on the way from Montgomery to Knoxville. Dr. P.H. Cardwell injected Williams with two shots of vitamin B12 that also contained a quarter-grain of morphine. Carr and Williams checked out of the hotel; the porters had to carry Williams to the car, as he was coughing and hiccuping. At around midnight on Thursday January 1, 1953, when they crossed the Tennessee state line and arrived in Bristol, Virginia, Carr stopped at a small all-night restaurant and asked Williams if he wanted to eat. Williams said he did not, and those are believed to be his last words. Carr later drove on until he stopped for fuel at a gas station in Oak Hill, West Virginia, where he realized that Williams was dead. The filling station's owner called the chief of the local police. In Williams' Cadillac the police found some empty <b>beer</b> <b>cans</b> and unfinished handwritten lyrics.|$|E

25|$|During the US Open in 1979, Năstase was {{defaulted}} {{from his}} match against John McEnroe. The umpire had previously docked Năstase {{a point in}} third set and then a game in the fourth for arguing and stalling. A near riot followed as the crowd disagreed with the umpire's decision, by throwing <b>beer</b> <b>cans</b> and cups on court. The match was eventually restarted with the umpire being replaced before McEnroe ran out the winner.|$|E
25|$|King's addictions {{to alcohol}} and other drugs were so serious during the 1980s that, as he {{acknowledged}} in On Writing in 2000, he can barely remember writing Cujo. Shortly after the novel's publication, King's family and friends staged an intervention, dumping on the rug {{in front of him}} evidence of his addictions taken from his office including <b>beer</b> <b>cans,</b> cigarette butts, grams of cocaine, Xanax, Valium, NyQuil, dextromethorphan (cough medicine) and marijuana. As King related in his memoir, he then sought help, quit all drugs (including alcohol) in the late 1980s, and has remained sober since. The first novel he wrote after becoming sober was Needful Things.|$|E
25|$|The {{point of}} Task Force Growdon reached Munsan-ni at 18:30 on March 23, but the {{remainder}} of the extended column took several hours longer. The force encountered no Chinese positions along Route 1 but was kept to an intermittent crawl by having to lift or explode over 150 live mines, some of them booby-trapped, and almost as many dummy mines, including a five-mile (8km) stretch of buried C-rations and <b>beer</b> <b>cans.</b> Casualties were few, but four tanks were disabled by mines. As the last of these tanks hit a mine a mile (1.5km) below Munsan-ni, the explosion attracted artillery fire that damaged two more. The tail of the task force finally arrived at the airborne position at 07:00 on March 24.|$|E

On 16 March 1980, in Las Vegas, {{he was given a}} shot at World Middleweight Champion Vito Antuofermo's title at the Caesars Palace. He won the title by a 15-round {{decision}} and, in a rematch, he retained the world title by a TKO in eight rounds. Minter's run as world champion came to an end on 27 September of that year, when he was stopped on cuts in three rounds to Marvin Hagler at Wembley Arena in London. After the fight was stopped, Minter's supporters caused a riot, throwing <b>beer</b> <b>cans</b> and bottles into the ring and both boxers had to be ushered away by the police.|$|E
25|$|Gordon only {{recorded}} two wins in 2006 at Infineon and Chicagoland, {{while also}} recording only two poles at Dover and Phoenix's second dates. The next year, his performance improved greatly, winning six races and seven poles. Gordon's first win of 2007 was at Phoenix, tying Darrell Waltrip's modern-day record of 59 poles, followed by tying Dale Earnhardt for sixth all-time in overall number of Cup wins. At Talladega, he recorded his 77th career Cup victory, {{to the dismay}} of the fans, who began throwing <b>beer</b> <b>cans</b> at Gordon's car. Gordon would win five more times during the season, at Darlington, Pocono, Talladega and Charlotte; Gordon's seven poles occurred at Fontana, Bristol, four consecutive at Texas, Phoenix, Talladega and Richmond, Daytona, Watkins Glen, Michigan and Martinsville. However, Gordon finished the Chase second in the standings to HMS teammate Jimmie Johnson by 77 points. Gordon finished the year with 30 top tens, setting a new modern era Cup Series record. This marked the second time that Gordon lost a championship because of the Chase points system. Had the Chase not existed, Gordon would have won the championship by 353 points.|$|E
25|$|Pop art in America {{was to a}} {{large degree}} {{initially}} inspired by the works of Jasper Johns, Larry Rivers, and Robert Rauschenberg. Although the paintings of Gerald Murphy, Stuart Davis and Charles Demuth during the 1920s and 1930s set the table for Pop art in America. In New York City during the mid-1950s Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of Abstract expressionist painting. Actually their works and the work of Larry Rivers, were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion and the combining of mundane materials into their work. The innovations of Johns' specific use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, <b>beer</b> <b>cans</b> and the American Flag; Rivers paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as George Washington crossing the Delaware, and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from Camel cigarettes, and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and taxidermy gave rise to a radical new movement in American art. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as Pop art.|$|E

25|$|As Price {{pitched in}} the fourth game, the start in game 5 went to Marcus Stroman, who opposed Cole Hamels {{for the second time}} in the ALDS. Texas got out to a 1–0 lead quickly, scoring in the first inning. In the third inning, Shin-Soo Choo hit a solo home run, giving Texas a two-run lead. The Jays responded in the bottom of the third, with Jose Bautista {{doubling}} in Ben Revere. In the sixth inning, Edwin Encarnacion hit a home run to tie the game at 2–2. In the seventh inning, controversy arose when Russell Martin attempted to throw the ball back to pitcher Aaron Sanchez. The ball hit the bat of Shin-Soo Choo, and went toward third base. Rougned Odor, who was at third base, scored the go-ahead run on the play, though initially home plate umpire Dale Scott rules the ball dead. After a lengthy delay, which included Toronto fans throwing <b>beer</b> <b>cans</b> and plastic bottles onto the field, the call was upheld, and Texas took a 3–2 lead. Shortly afterward, Toronto manager John Gibbons informed the umpires that the team would play the rest of the game under protest. In the bottom half of the seventh inning, the Texas defence would commit three errors, which loaded the bases with no outs. After Ben Revere grounded out, Josh Donaldson tied the game with a bloop single to right field. With runners on first and third and two outs in the inning, Jose Bautista hit a go-ahead three-run home run to take a commanding 6–3 lead. Bautista flipped his bat after he scored the home run, which later became viral on social media. Roberto Osuna came on to close the game with a five-out save, becoming the second-youngest pitcher in MLB history to record a postseason save by sealing the 6–3 victory.|$|E
500|$|A decade later, a New York Times {{reporter}} {{visiting the}} zoo noted that [...] "...an Asiatic Black Bear {{lay on a}} rock {{a short distance from}} a guard rail. A shattered wine bottle, a cracked stick, and a number of empty <b>beer</b> <b>cans</b> were strewn about the ground a few feet in front of him. 'How many times have I seen a bear lift his foot and leave a bloody foot print?' said John Kinzig, a park supervisor at the Prospect Park Zoo. 'Vandalism is a major problem, and deterioration is overtaking repairs.'" [...] Activists were pressing for major renovations of the zoo, which, in 1983, was rated by the Humane Society of the United States as one of the [...] "10 worst" [...] zoos in the country. Others felt that a zoo was not in keeping with the original design of Prospect Park and urged its complete removal from the grounds. A fatal accident of an 11-year-old boy scaling the fence to the polar bear pit only served to underscore difficulties with the fifty-year-old facility.|$|E
500|$|The sets of the Nostromos three decks {{were each}} created almost entirely in one piece, with each deck occupying a {{separate}} stage. The actors had to navigate through the hallways that connected the stages, {{adding to the}} film's sense of claustrophobia and realism. The sets used large transistors and low-resolution computer screens to give the ship a [...] "used", industrial look and make it appear {{as though it was}} constructed of [...] "retrofitted old technology". Ron Cobb created industrial-style symbols and color-coded signs for various areas and aspects of the ship. The company that owns the Nostromo is not named in the film, and is referred to by the characters as [...] "the company". However, the name and logo of [...] "Weylan-Yutani" [...] appears on several set pieces and props such as computer monitors and <b>beer</b> <b>cans.</b> Cobb created the name to imply a business alliance between Britain and Japan, deriving [...] "Weylan" [...] from the British Leyland Motor Corporation and [...] "Yutani" [...] from the name of his Japanese neighbor. The 1986 sequel, Aliens, named the company as [...] "Weyland-Yutani", and it has remained a central aspect of the film franchise.|$|E

500|$|Joshua Walsh was {{responsible}} for creating True Detective artwork. His work for the show consists of over 100 individual [...] "devil's nests"—twig sculptures created by the killer—along with wall paintings and miniature sculptures of men made of <b>beer</b> <b>cans,</b> among others. According to DiGerlando, Walsh's interests in hunting and taxidermy made him [...] "the perfect dude for the job". A blueprint for the devil's nests was not well established in the script, other than specifications that the structures {{be able to stand}} on their own and feature a spiral motif. DiGerlando and Walsh went with a tripod design that showed a spiral when viewed from the base, and contained ladder-like crossing elements that symbolized the killer's desire to ascend to a dark spiritual plane. Each design had subtle differences from one another. DiGerlando cited the work of Henry Darger and James Charles Castle as strong stylistic influences and sought a primitive look for the sculptures, one that revealed the workings of a man with [...] "some deep inner urge to express himself". To reflect this, Walsh built devil's nests using mud, secondhand children's clothing, reeds, roots, and other materials he felt the killer would use.|$|E
500|$|The {{move by the}} teams, to come to {{the grid}} and then pull out after the {{formation}} lap into the pits, infuriated the fans, who did not know about the plan. Boos were heard during the race, and some upset fans threw <b>beer</b> <b>cans</b> and water bottles on the track. BBC Radio broadcaster Maurice Hamilton said of the event, [...] "Without question, it was the strangest race I commentated on in F1." [...] Because of the retirement of the drivers who qualified ahead of them, Michael Schumacher and his Ferrari teammate, Barrichello, were the foremost starters, though using the grid positions they had qualified in; the pair were followed by Tiago Monteiro and Narain Karthikeyan, both driving for Jordan. Rounding out the remaining field of six were Christijan Albers and Patrick Friesacher of Minardi. Schumacher retained the lead when the race started, and the only changes in positioning came when Karthikeyan overtook Albers but immediately lost the position again going into turn 1. The two Ferrari drivers quickly built a significant lead over their rivals, and Schumacher ended up with the victory, ahead of Barrichello. Monteiro and Karthikeyan finished in a distant third and fourth, and Albers and Friesacher brought up the rear.|$|E
500|$|The police {{tried to}} {{restrain}} {{some of the}} crowd, and knocked a few people down, which incited bystanders even more. Some of those handcuffed in the wagon escaped when police left them unattended (deliberately, according to some witnesses). As the crowd tried to overturn the police wagon, two police cars and the wagon—with a few slashed tires—left immediately, with Inspector Pine urging them to return as soon as possible. The commotion attracted more people who learned what was happening. Someone in the crowd declared that the bar had been raided because [...] "they didn't pay off the cops", to which someone else yelled [...] "Let's pay them off!" [...] Coins sailed through the air towards the police as the crowd shouted [...] "Pigs!" [...] and [...] "Faggot cops!" [...] <b>Beer</b> <b>cans</b> were thrown and the police lashed out, dispersing some of the crowd who found a construction site nearby with stacks of bricks. The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600people, grabbed several people, including folk singer Dave Van Ronk—who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: [...] "As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why I stayed in... Every time you turned around the cops were pulling some outrage or another." [...] Ten police officers—including two policewomen—barricaded themselves, Van Ronk, Howard Smith (a writer for The Village Voice), and several handcuffed detainees inside the Stonewall Inn for their own safety.|$|E
