5|$|At the State Defense Committee {{meeting on}} September 13 (the {{time of the}} Soviet Exercise Zapad-81 {{maneuvers}} and of renewed pressure on the Polish leadership), Kania was warned by the uniformed cadres that the progressing counterrevolution must <b>be</b> <b>terminated</b> by an imposition of martial law. The PZPR regional secretaries soon issued the same demands. Under the circumstances, in October First Secretary Kania stepped down and Prime Minister Jaruzelski became also the party chief.|$|E
5|$|Factors {{affecting}} one's {{ability to}} delay gratification {{depend on whether}} the delay contingency is self-imposed (delay can <b>be</b> <b>terminated</b> at {{the will of the}} person waiting) or externally imposed by another person, institution or circumstance. When the contingency is self-imposed, the physical presence of the reward seems to aid in delaying gratification. On the other hand, when the delay is externally imposed, children are not able to wait as long when the reward is present, suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances.|$|E

5|$|On 23 September 1996, NSB's {{administration}} {{recommended that}} the purchase <b>be</b> <b>terminated.</b> However, this was put on hold by the board. Instead, a renegotiated contract was signed, whereby Siemens was obliged to deliver the locomotives, as specified, by mid-1997. If not, the two parties agreed that the contract would <b>be</b> <b>terminated.</b> By late 1996, five locomotives had been delivered, and these were returned to Kiel for upgrades. The first returned to Norway on 30 November 1996, after the ventilator motors had been upgraded, new oil coolers installed and other minor upgrades had been performed. From January 1997, they were put into regular use with freight trains on the Nordland Line. In mid-1997, number 664 was damaged in a fire caused by an incorrectly mounted exhaust system. In October 1997, cracks {{were found in the}} wheels, and all units were taken out of service while they were being fixed.|$|E
5|$|After it {{was decided}} that {{passenger}} transport on the railway was to <b>be</b> <b>terminated,</b> both NSB's bus division and other private companies, particularly Sverre Hage, wanted to have the concession to operate the line. Both established a bus services with a frequency as if the other operator did not exist. At the peak of the conflict, NSB's operations were at one point stopped by the police, although in the end, the concession was granted to them. As a response, Haga applied for concession to operate passenger transport on the railway, but this was denied by the authorities. The transfer to bus operations increased the ticket prices and travel time.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{having the}} better chances, York drew 0–0 {{at home with}} Cambridge United, before being beaten 3–1 away by Wrexham, in which Wilkinson scored a late {{consolation}} goal. The club made an attempt to re-sign former striker Clayton Donaldson on loan from Crewe Alexandra, but were told to make an inquiry four weeks later, due to him being injured. York's first double of the season came with a 2–0 away win over Woking, the goals coming from Wilkinson and McBreen. Iyseden Christie's loan spell at Kettering from Stevenage was to <b>be</b> <b>terminated</b> for a loan move to York to go ahead, but this deal fell through. Walker revealed {{he was interested in}} signing striker Bruce Dyer, shortly after he played against York's reserve team for Bradford City.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, Enron {{established}} {{a joint venture}} in energy investments with CalPERS, the California state pension fund, called the Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI). In 1997, Skilling, serving as Chief Operating Officer (COO), asked CalPERS to join Enron in a separate investment. CalPERS {{was interested in the}} idea, but only if it could <b>be</b> <b>terminated</b> as a partner in JEDI. However, Enron did not want to show any debt from assuming CalPERS' stake in JEDI on its balance sheet. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Fastow developed the special purpose entity Chewco Investments limited partnership (L.P.) which raised debt guaranteed by Enron and was used to acquire CalPERS's joint venture stake for $383 million. Because of Fastow's organization of Chewco, JEDI's losses were kept off of Enron's balance sheet.|$|E
5|$|The Triangle Link {{was passed}} by the various {{municipal}} councils in February and March 1988. Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a pontoon bridge, and stated that {{two and a half years}} of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for the Triangle Link was published in early 1989. It recommended that the Langevåg–Buavåg Ferry, which connected to southern Bømlo, remain, but that the other four ferry services <b>be</b> <b>terminated.</b> During late 1989, advance tolling on the ferries was approved by the municipal councils and the county council, who recommended that collection start from 1 July 1990. However, the start date was not supported by the national government and the issue placed on hold.|$|E
5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, stiffness and damping. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements {{are used in the}} body of the filter (although the filter may <b>be</b> <b>terminated</b> with resistors at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.|$|E

5|$|There {{was still}} fog on the plateau on 1 September, but by 15:00 CEST it was {{possible}} to fly a team there by helicopter. Because the fog stayed, the team retained work until 03:00 CEST in the night. In the following days, the fog lifted, making work and transport easier. By 5 September, all bodies had been recovered and the work at the plateau could <b>be</b> <b>terminated.</b> The recovery in the valley was completed two days later. The accident resulted in about 40 journalists staying in Svalbard to cover the story. The Norwegian authority's costs related to the investigation and other activities related to the accident were estimated at 30 million Norwegian krone (NOK).|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to London briefly in mid-1939, the couple returned to America, Leigh to film the final takes for Gone with the Wind, and Olivier {{to prepare for}} filming of Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca—although the couple had hoped to appear in it together. Instead, Joan Fontaine was selected {{for the role of}} Mrs de Winter, as the producer David O. Selznick thought that not only was she more suitable for the role, but that it was best to keep Olivier and Leigh apart until their divorces came through. Olivier followed Rebecca with Pride and Prejudice, in the role of Mr. Darcy. To his disappointment Elizabeth Bennet was played by Greer Garson rather than Leigh. He received good reviews for both films and showed a more confident screen presence than he had in his early work. In January 1940 Olivier and Esmond were granted their divorce. In February, following another request from Leigh, her husband also applied for their marriage to <b>be</b> <b>terminated.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, Monroe took an 18-month hiatus from work to concentrate on married life on the East Coast.

She became pregnant in mid-1957, but it was ectopic and had to <b>be</b> <b>terminated.</b> She suffered a miscarriage a year later. Her gynecological problems were largely caused by endometriosis, a disease from which she suffered throughout her adult life. Monroe was also briefly hospitalized during this time due to a barbiturate overdose. During the hiatus, she dismissed Greene from MMP and bought {{his share of the}} company as they could not settle their disagreements and she had begun to suspect that he was embezzling money from the company.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the plans}} were officially shelved, locals {{continued}} {{to work with the}} idea of a road connecting Averøy with the mainland. The toll company Atlanterhavsveien AS was established in 1970. Arne Rettedal, who was Minister of Local Government and Regional Development in the early 1980s, proposed that job creation funds could be allocated to road projects. The proposal was approved in 1983, after it had been supported by the municipalities of Averøy, Eide and Fræna. Construction started as a municipal road project on 1 August 1983, but progressed slowly. From 1 July 1986, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration took over the project, speeding up construction and allowing it to open on 7 July 1989. During construction, the area was hit by 12 hurricanes. The opening of the road allowed the Tøvik–Ørjavik Ferry to <b>be</b> <b>terminated.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} through the game, they are relayed command orders and objectives dispatched by the Selene military satellite, Hyperion. The orders are synthesized by the on-board central computer EOS, which also records and relays the player's flight and battle record data back to Hyperion. After {{completion of the}} last objective, the player is informed by Hyperion that the battle pattern of the latest EOS unmanned fighter has been completed {{according to the data}} from their battle record. The player is given the honor of being the target of the last EOS test as reward for their heroic efforts and that upon the player's death, they shall advance two classes and be awarded the Sirius decoration. After surviving the intense barrage of artillery fire of the EOS test, the pilot wonders why they must <b>be</b> <b>terminated</b> by their ally and questions their military leaders' rationale for the war.|$|E
5|$|Bømlo Municipal Council voted {{unanimously}} {{in favor of}} the Triangle Link on 22 February 1988. Two days later, the issue was discussed in Stord Municipal Council. Olav Akselsen at first proposed supporting the pontoon bridge, but after a trial vote he withdrew the proposal and also Stord supported the Triangle Link. The following week, Sveio Municipal Council voted in favor the Triangle Link, without either a debate or dissent in the council. Fitjar Municipal Council voted on 15 March to work with both proposals. Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a pontoon bridge, and stated that {{two and a half years}} of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for the Triangle Link was published in early 1989, estimating the costs at NOK890 million. It recommended that the Langevåg–Buavåg Ferry remain, but the other four ferry services <b>be</b> <b>terminated.</b> The report concluded that the maintenance costs of the fixed link would be lower than the subsidies of the ferry, that the project would be economical of society and would reduce emissions.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay {{takes place}} in the Fragmented Sectors, an area of outer space filled with asteroids that are rich in mineral resources. The aim of the game is to {{colonise}} and mine the asteroids for the various ores found on them and then sell the ore to the Federation. The player can use the proceeds for empire expansion, purchasing new technologies, construction of buildings, ships and missiles, spying, trading and also to pay fines should the Federation impose any. Construction of the various missiles and ships requires quantities of different ores, so the decision to sell to the Federation is not straightforward. The game has a stock market where commodities can be bought and sold. There is also a black market offering unauthorised information regarding individual spies and colony supervisors, and illicit trade in rare ores and missiles. The manual states that any TetraCorp employee caught selling ore on the black market will <b>be</b> <b>terminated.</b>|$|E
