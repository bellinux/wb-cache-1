Most of the emissions, of which major ones were NOx, CO, VOC and CHG, were found to decrease substantially due to the stringent environmental policy. Survey of 6 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (6 PAHs) along a motorway and a local road displayed high accumulation of benzo[a]pyrene BaP and other PAHs in soil (0 - 20 cm) and their vertical migration to deeper layers. Concentrations of PAHs in soil, both along a motorway and a local road appeared to exceed MCL in <b>soils</b> of A <b>class</b> (protected areas) and <b>B</b> <b>class</b> (agricultural <b>soils)</b> for one-two orders of magnitude that disqualifies these lands for agricultural use...|$|R

40|$|According to {{the floral}} organ {{development}} ABC model, <b>B</b> <b>class</b> genes specify petal and stamen identification. In order {{to study the}} function of <b>B</b> <b>class</b> genes in flower development of Tagetes erecta, five MADS-box <b>B</b> <b>class</b> genes were identified and their expression and putative functions were studied. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses indicated that there were one PI-like gene-TePI, two euAP 3 -like genes-TeAP 3 - 1 and TeAP 3 - 2, and two TM 6 -like genes-TeTM 6 - 1 and TeTM 6 - 2 in T. erecta. Strong expression levels of these genes were detected in stamens of the disk florets, but little or no expression was detected in bracts, receptacles or vegetative organs. Yeast hybrid experiments of the <b>B</b> <b>class</b> proteins showed that TePI protein could form a homodimer and heterodimers {{with all the other}} four <b>B</b> <b>class</b> proteins TeAP 3 - 1, TeAP 3 - 2, TeTM 6 - 1 and TeTM 6 - 2. No homodimer or interaction was observed between the euAP 3 and TM 6 clade members. Over-expression of five <b>B</b> <b>class</b> genes of T. erecta in Nicotiana rotundifolia showed that only the transgenic plants of 35 S::TePI showed altered floral morphology compared with the non-transgenic line. This study could contribute {{to the understanding of the}} function of <b>B</b> <b>class</b> genes in flower development of T. erecta, and provide a theoretical basis for further research to change floral organ structures and create new materials for plant breeding...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{of flower}} {{development}} in core eudicot species {{have established a}} central role for <b>B</b> <b>class</b> MADS-box genes in specifying petal and stamen identities. Similarly in maize and rice, <b>B</b> <b>class</b> genes are essential for lodicule and stamen specification, suggesting homology of petals and lodicules and conservation of <b>B</b> <b>class</b> gene activity across angiosperms. However, lodicules are grass-specific organs with a morphology distinct from petals, thus their true homology to eudicot and nongrass monocot floral organs has been a topic of debate. To understand the relationship of lodicules to the sterile floral organs of nongrass monocots we have isolated and observed the expression of <b>B</b> <b>class</b> genes from a basal grass Streptochaeta that diverged before the evolution of lodicules, {{as well as the}} outgroups Joinvillea and Elegia, which have a typical monocot floral plan. Our results support a conserved role for B function genes across the angiosperms and provide additional evidence linking the evolution of lodicules and second whorl tepal/petals of monocots. The expression data and morphological analysis suggest that the function of <b>B</b> <b>class</b> genes should be broadly interpreted as required for differentiation of a distinct second floral whorl as opposed to specifying petal identity per se...|$|R

50|$|In 1914 Reid {{ordered the}} first batch of 5 engines of his {{improved}} <b>B</b> <b>class</b> design. From 1914 to 1919 these engines were simply considered {{to be part of}} the <b>B</b> <b>class,</b> by which time around 70 had been produced. However, with a new batch ordered in 1919 Reid made several minor alterations, including an increase in working boiler pressure from 165psi to 175 psi. These engines, together with all subsequent batches, were given a new designation, as S class. Several of the earlier locomotives were upgraded to the new 175psi boiler pressure, and redesignated as S class. Finally, upon grouping in 1923, the LNER upgraded all of the S class engines and all of the improved <b>B</b> <b>class</b> engines, to a working boiler pressure of 180psi, and formally grouped them all together into the J37 <b>class.</b> The improved <b>B</b> <b>class</b> J37s and the S class J37s together totalled 104 engines.|$|R

40|$|In monocots and eudicots, <b>B</b> <b>class</b> {{function}} specifies {{second and}} third whorl floral organ identity {{as described in the}} classic ABCE model. Grass <b>B</b> <b>class</b> APETALA 3 /DEFICIENS orthologs have been functionally characterized; here, we describe the positional cloning and characterization of a maize (Zea mays) PISTILLATA/GLOBOSA ortholog Zea mays mads 16 (Zmm 16) /sterile tassel silky ear 1 (sts 1). We show that, similar to many eudicots, all the maize <b>B</b> <b>class</b> proteins bind DNA as obligate heterodimers and positively regulate their own expression. However, sts 1 mutants have novel phenotypes that provide insight into two derived aspects of maize flower development: carpel abortion and floral asymmetry. Specifically, we show that carpel abortion acts downstream of organ identity and requires the growth-promoting factor grassy tillers 1 and that the maize <b>B</b> <b>class</b> genes are expressed asymmetrically, likely in response to zygomorphy of grass floral primordia. Further investigation reveals that floral phyllotactic patterning is also zygomorphic, suggesting significant mechanistic differences with the well-characterized models of floral polarity. These unexpected results show that despite extensive study of <b>B</b> <b>class</b> gene functions in diverse flowering plants, novel insights can be gained from careful investigation of homeotic mutants outside the core eudicot model species...|$|R
