However, when the impact energy is low enough as not to cause visible damage, the dynamic effect at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> may cause internal damage to the laminate. Laminates were loaded quasi-statically and by impact to the same bending strain and with the same indenter shape several times.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{impact of}} an elastic plate of nite length that is dropped against a liquid free surface is analyzed. The liquid is assumed ideal and {{incompressible}} and its motion two-dimentional, symmetric and potential. The elastic plate {{is the bottom}} of a structure, which penetrates the liquid at a constant velocity. The plate de ection is governed by the Euler beam equation and the beam edges are assumed connected with a main structure by a spring. The problem is coupled because the liquid ow, the beam de ection and the geometry of the contact region between the body and the liquid must be determined simultaneously. The analysis is based on the normal mode method with hydroelastic behaviour of the plate being of the main interest. It is shown that, at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> stage, independently of the rigidity of the connecting springs, the edges of the plate move toward the liquid surface. This fact may lead to a separation of a ship shell from the basic construction. The constructed algorithm allows one to perform the analysis of elastic eects during the impact of a liquid with thin-walled plates of limited extent. In addition, free fall motion is considered within this model as a limiting case for which the junction-spring stiness approaches zero...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE Ball impact {{technique}} {{is essential for}} successful in instep soccer kicking. However, to date, only a few studies focused on ball impact phase, in which plantar flexion motion of the foot was solely reported (Asai et al., 1995; Nunome et al., 2006). Furthermore, no study has examined {{the behavior of the}} ball during ball impact that would be related to motion of the foot during ball impact. The aims of this study were to illustrate the three-dimensional motion of the foot (plantar / dorsal flexion, abduction / adduction, inversion / eversion) and the motion of center of gravity of the ball during ball impact, and to examine the interaction between the motion of the foot and the ball behavior during ball impact. METHODS Eleven experienced male soccer players participated in this study. To analyze the interaction between foot and ball in detail, two ultra high-speed video cameras (NAC Inc., Tokyo, Japan) were used to capture the motion of kicking limb and ball at 5000 Hz. Ball deformation and position of center of gravity of the ball were calculated from the lateral side image. RESULTS The foot was plantarflexed, abducted and everted during contact with the ball. In particular, the foot was dorsalyflexed slightly at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact,</b> and begins to plantarflexed after middle of the impact. The peak force acing on the foot almost coincides with the peak ball deformation, and magnitude of peak force reached approxi-mately 2700 N. ...|$|E

Current thesis {{is an attempt to}} provide a FE model which can be utilized for the analysis of the pedestrian kinematics. The author has focused on the bonnet modeling in LS-DYNA; furthermore, the modeling task was developed to provide the model of other influencing components in vehicle’s front end namely: fenders, engine cover, battery cover and frame. Through the use of GeoMagic studio, CATIA, HyperMesh, LS-Prepost and LS-DYNA, the FE models of all previously cited parts are prepared respectively. To investigate the response of the model to head and torso impacts, Euro-NCAP Head-form impacts tests were simulated and the responses evaluated. Also a FE model of a rigid torso impactor is modeled in LS-DYNA based on a mechanical torso impactor designed at Autoliv and the simulation results were compared and evaluated with the impact tests performed at Autoliv. A first investigation deals with the response of the bonnet when exposed to different loads at different positions on the bonnet. It was found that the kinematics was influenced mainly by the stiffness of the collision point and particularly if the rigid parts were engaged in the impact {{and the size of the}} gap between the hood and the rigid components. A second study involves the comparison between the results of available experiments and those obtained in reconstruction of these experiments. Despite showing comparable peak acceleration and impact duration, the results indicated a significant discrepancy in terms of the shape and slope at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact.</b> Finally, through the use of a parametric study, the effects of thickness, material, positioning tolerance, velocity tolerance, impactor angle and control shell part were investigated...|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} discrete element model (DEM) [1, 2] {{was used}} to simulate the dynamic damage process of a cross-ply fiber reinforced polymer laminate (0 °/ 90 °/ 0 °/ 90 °) under a low-velocity impact. Nominal fibers were defined in the longitudinal and transverse directions to describe the anisotropic behavior in 0 ° ply and 90 ° ply. Both the matrix and the nominal fibre are considered as brittle elastic materials. The interface between the fibre and matrix, and the interface between different plies were represented by cohesive softening model {{which is similar to}} the cohesive zone model (CZM). It was possible to model a quarter of the laminate due to symmetry, {{in order to reduce the}} computational time. The specimen was supported by two walls and impacted by a rigid ball which represented the projectile. The matrix cracking, debonding between fibre-matrix and delamination between plies were simulated successfully using the DEM model. It can be observed from the numerical results obtained from the three-dimensional DEM modeling that the delamination initiated at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> and propagated into the specimen with the penetration of the impacting ball. Numerical results show that the geometry of the delamination area agrees well with existing experimental and finite element results [3]. The accumulated damage of the specimen increases with the impacting displacement, while the impacting velocity decreases with an increase in the impacting displacement which is represented by the computation steps here. However, the model will need further modifications to incorporate more realistic fibre models and the DEM micro parameters should be calibrated via a series of mechanical experiments in the future work, especially the ply interface strength which can be estimated by double cantilever beam test. Also, a larger DEM model which includes hundreds thousands of particles would better represent the details of the microstructure of the laminate and could be another focus of future work...|$|E

40|$|Traditional scaling {{methodology}} which utilizes channel doping, shallow junctions, etc. is {{no longer}} sufficient to control the short channel effects (SCE) in the devices scaled down into decananometer range. For ultimate scaling when the SCE control becomes more crucial, alternative architectures such as e. g. ultra-thin body (UTB) silicon-on-insulator (SOI) offer better SCE control while maintaining very high device performances. Ultra-thin body device featuring ultra-thin buried oxide (UTBB) is <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> this study. In <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis, <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buried oxide thinning from standard (140 nm) to ultra-thin (10 nm) dimensions is investigated through experiments and simulations paying particular attention to <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> drain and substrate biases. Better electrostatic control with lower DIBL can be achieved in UTBB devices compared to UTB ones. However, thin buried oxide triggers stronger influence of substrate depletion and coupling through the substrate on the device behavior. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that introduction of so-called ground-plane (i. e. localized highly-doped region in the substrate just underneath the BOX) can eliminate the substrate depletion effect without deteriorating the other benefits. Next, widely-employed by industry MASTAR equations for DIBL and subthreshold slope are modified {{in order to take}} into account the mean channel position and substrate depletion thickness as a function of substrate bias. In addition, <b>the</b> perspectives <b>of</b> UTBB for analog and RF applications are experimentally analyzed and benchmarked with other state-of-the art technologies.

40|$|Upon {{impact of}} a solid body on the plane surface of a fluid, there occurs on the vetted {{surface of the body}} an abrupt {{pressure}} rise which propagates into both media with the speed of sound. Below, we assume the case where the speed of propagation of sound in the body which falls {{on the surface of the}} fluid may be regarded as infinitely large in comparison with the speed of propagation of sound in the fluid; that is, we shall assume that the falling body is absolutely rigid. IN this case, the entire relative speed of the motion which takes place at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> is absorbed by the fluid. The hydrodynamic pressures arising thereby are propagated from the contact surface within the fluid with the speed of sound in the form of compression and expansion waves and are gradually damped. After this, they are dispersed like impact pressures, reach ever larger regions of the fluid remote fran the body and became equal to zero; in the fluid there remain hydrodynamic pressures corresponding to the motion of the body after the impact. Neglecting the forces of viscosity and taking into account, furthermore, that the motion of the fluid begins from a state of rest, according to Thomson's theorem, we may consider the motion of an ideal compressible fluid in the process of impact to be potential. We examine the case of impact upon the surface of a ccmpressible fluid of a flat plate of infinite extent or of a body, the immersed part of the surface of which may be called approximately flat. In this report we discuss the first phase of the impact pressure on the surface of a fluid, prior to the appearance of a cavity, since at this stage the hydrodynamic pressures reach their maximum values. Observations, after the fall of the bodies on the surface of the fluid, show that the free surface of the fluid at this stage is almost completely at rest if one does not take into account the small rise in the neighborhood of the boundaries of the impact surface...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{the impact}} between a water surface and a {{structure}} is addressed in two related experiments. In the first experiment, {{the impact of}} a plunging breaking wave on a partially submerged 2 D structure is studied. The evolution of the water surface profiles are measured with with a cinematic laser-induced flourescence technique, while the pressure distribution on the wall is measured simultaneously with an array of fast-response pressure sensors. When the structure is placed at a particular streamwise location in the wave tank and the bottom surface of the structure is located 13. 3 ~cm below the mean water level, a ``flip-through'' impact occurs. In this case, the water surface profile between the crest and the front face of the structure is found to shrink to a point as the wave approaches the structure without breaking. High acceleration of the contact point motion is observed in this case. When the bottom of the structure is located at the mean water level, high-frequency pressure oscillations are observed. These pressure oscillations are believed to be caused by air that is entrapped near the wave crest during the impact process. When the bottom of the structure is sufficiently far above the mean water level, the first contact with the structure is the impact between the wave crest and the bottom corner of the structure. This latter condition, produces the largest impact pressures on the structure. In the second experiment, the slamming of a flat plate on a quiescent water surface is studied. A two-axis high-speed carriage is used to slam a flat plate on the water surface with high horizontal and vertical velocity. The above-mentioned LIF system is used to measure the evolution of the free surface adjacent to the plate. Measurements are performed with the horizontal and vertical carriage speeds ranging from zero to 6 m/s and 0. 6 to 1. 2 m/s, respectively, and the plate oriented obliquely to horizontal. Two types of splash are found, a spray of droplets and ligaments that is ejected horizontally from under the plate in the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> process and a highly sloped spray sheet that is ejected later when the high edge of the plate moves below the water surface.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the loads}} {{that occurred during}} an ice ridge ramming experiment with the icebreaker Oden. Sea ice ridges are formed due to breaking and deformation of the ice cover. Wind, current, thermal expansion and Coriolis forces induce compression and shear forces onto level ice which can break the ice into rubble. The blocks of ice rubble are pushed together, forming a wall of broken ice in hydrostatic equilibrium. This wall of broken ice forced up by pressure is defined as an ice ridge. In general ice ridges are long, nonsymmetrical, curvilinear features with a wide variability of sizes and shapes. In Arctic regions, sea ice ridges are often {{used to calculate the}} design load in the absence of icebergs. Ice ridges also {{play a major role in}} icebreaker efficiency, since an icebreaker might need several ‘rams’ to break through an ice ridge. Ice ridge actions on icebreakers are not completely understood. Complex ice behavior under rapidly applied stress, and the complex geometries of the bodies in contact makes it a challenging research topic. The dynamic behavior of the vessel during the ramming can be used to make an estimate of the ice loads that occurred. This thesis analyses the ice load that occurred during a ridge ramming experiment that was performed with icebreaker Oden during the ODEN AT research cruise project in 2013. To advance our understanding in the global ice ridge ramming loads, twomodels were developed: 1) a simulationmodel using the Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) of mechanical crushing of ice to calculate the global ice loads, 2) a load identification model using full-scale data to determine the global ice loads. The simulation model was developed to enhance the understanding of relevant physical phenomena and parameters. During this process, specific energy principles of crushing of ice were identified as a promising although relatively unknown method for impact dynamics into ice. The Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) of mechanical crushing of ice is defined as the energy per unit mass of crushed ice, necessary to turn solid ice into crushed (pulverized) material. Besides the SEA value, the penetration velocity, density of ice, and volume of crushed ice, are required to calculate the ice load. A contact model was developed to determine the load location and direction on the hull. The icebreaker Oden is represented by a nonlinear mass-damper-spring system. Maneuvering theory is applied, which means that the hydrodynamic variables are estimated at one frequency of oscillation. In the simulation model, a known thrust force is applied on the vessel, making it move forward in open water, and then penetrate the ice ridge. The simulation model calculates the ice loads and vessel’s motions (i. e. accelerations, velocity, and displacement). The load identification model combines the Kalman filter and a joint input-state estimate algorithm to estimate the state- and excitation vector from acceleration, velocity and displacement data in 3 DOF (i. e. surge, heave, pitch). The joint input-state estimate algorithm combines measured data with an estimate of the state of the system in a way that minimizes the error. The full-scale data analyzed in this thesis includes a profile of amulti-year ice ridge, vessel characteristics, acceleration data from a motion reference unit (MRU), GPS data, and propulsion data. From the results of the load identification model, we conclude that the current combination of model and data does not provide sufficient information to estimate the global ridge ramming loads with high reliability. The main reasons for this are the absence of additional MRU(s), the low sample frequency of the MRU, the data uncertainty, and the simplified hydromechanics. However, the suggested approach to calculate the global ice loads is reliable as long as the data is valid. This is verified by recalculating the ice loads from the data (i. e. motions), generated by the simulation model. Results indicate that the specific energy approach can be used to simulate an impact of a vessel into an ice ridge, under assumption that the ice fails purely due to crushing. This assumption is only valid during the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact,</b> as other failure modes often start to dominate as the penetration of the vessel into the ridge increases.

In this same era, Romanticism marked a shift from sympathy towards the mentally ill to a fascination with non-rational experiences by artists such as Henry Fuseli, Francisco Goya, and Eugène Delacroix. These artists were the first to utilize <b>the</b> depiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insane as an aesthetic counter to the classical ideal. By the fin-de-siècle, <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> social Darwinism led to theories of degeneracy, in which the insane were grouped with criminals and prostitutes as biologically deficient. The insane, through <b>the</b> lens <b>of</b> depictions of degeneracy, existed mainly in “scientific” studies and popular imagery. There was, however, a counter offensive in the arts, in which cabaret culture embodied this demeaning ideology as a subversive gesture against the bourgeoisie.

40|$|Abstract Background Education Outside the Classroom (EOTC) is a {{teaching}} method {{that aims to}} promote schoolchildren’s learning, physical activity (PA), social relations, motivation, and well-being. EOTC activities are characterized by teachers using the local environment in their teaching, and involve innovative teaching methods, child-led approaches to problem-solving, experimentation, cooperation, PA, and play. EOTC has become common practice for many teachers in Scandinavia; however, only case studies have evaluated its <b>impacts.</b> <b>The</b> TEACHOUT study aims to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> EOTC on Danish schoolchildren’s PA, social relations, motivation, well-being, and learning. Methods TEACHOUT is a quasi-experimental, cross-disciplinary study. Sixteen schools participated, containing 19 EOTC school classes and 19 parallel non-EOTC classes, {{with a total of}} 834 children aged 9 to 13 years. Measures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children’s social relations, motivation for school, well-being, and academic performance were collected at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> and end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school year. Data on PA levels were collected over ten-day periods during the school year using accelerometers. The amount and characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual EOTC provided in both EOTC and non-EOTC classes were monitored day-to-day throughout the school year, using an online teacher survey platform. <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> EOTC are mainly analysed by comparing EOTC pupils to non-EOTC (i. e. control) pupils based on their scores on the outcome variables (i. e. school performance, well-being, motivation, and social relations) at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school year, adjusting for the baseline values (from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year). <b>The</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> EOTC on PA are evaluated by comparing the total as well as context-specific amounts of PA of children participating in EOTC to those of children in their parallel non-EOTC classes. Furthermore, the interdependencies between PA, social relations, well-being, motivation, and learning are explored using path analysis. To help describe and understand the processes that have led to the quantitative outcomes, qualitative case observations of children’s practices and interactions in EOTC as well as classroom teaching were carried out and combined with qualitative interviews about children’s perceptions of these practices. Discussion The TEACHOUT study represents a holistic multidisciplinary approach to educational and school health-promotion research through its study design and combination of scientific disciplines and methods, as well as its focus on the interdependent relations between learning, PA, social relations, well-being, and motivation. This will result in a comprehensive picture of school health promotion and children’s health and well-being, which will broaden <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential benefits <b>of</b> EOTC in school health promotion and primary education. These results can be used to inform and guide future policy and practice...|$|R
40|$|The disease {{known as}} Pneumocystis carinii {{pneumonia}} (PCP) {{is a major}} cause of illness and death in persons with impaired immune systems. While the genus Pneumocystis has been known to science for nearly a century, understanding of its members remained rudimentary until DNA analysis showed its extensive diversity. Pneumocystis organisms from different host species have very different DNA sequences, indicating multiple species. In recognition of its genetic and functional distinctness, the organism that causes human PCP is now named Pneumocystis jiroveci Frenkel 1999. Changing the organism’s name does not preclude <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acronym PCP because it can be read “Pneumocystis pneumonia. ” DNA sequence variation exists among samples of P. jiroveci, a feature that allows reexamination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationships between host and pathogen. Instead of lifelong latency, transient colonization may be the rule. Clinical Importance <b>of</b> Pneumocystis <b>The</b> disease known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading causes <b>of</b> illness and death in persons with impaired immunity. The disease has been described in immunocompromised patients for many years, including outbreaks in malnourished young children in orphanages in Iran in the 1950 s (1 – 6). The AIDS epidemic, however, marked <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease’s <b>impact</b> on a substantial number of patients. PCP has long been the most common serious AIDS-defining opportunistic infection in the United States. <b>The</b> introduction <b>of</b> highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> HIV infection has been accompanied by substantial reductions in mortality and <b>the</b> incidence <b>of</b> opportunistic infections, including PCP (7). Despite these advances, Pneumocystis remains a major pathogen in HIVinfected persons who either are not receiving or are not responding to HAART and among those who are unaware of their HIV status. PCP is also of clinical importance in people immunocompromised for reasons other than HIV, such as organ transplantation or chemotherapy for malignant diseases (8). In addition, Pneumocystis infection has been documented recently in persons who are mildly immunocompromised, including those with chronic lung disease (9) ...|$|R
40|$|Comprised {{of cover}} ply, tensor ply and {{carrying}} ply, tensor skin {{is a kind}} of composite sandwich structure developed to improve the helicopter's crashworthiness in water impacts. In this study, a theoretical model is proposed to analyze the static and dynamic response of a kind <b>of</b> tensor skin. <b>The</b> whole response <b>of</b> tensor skin is divided into three stages: an elastic deformation stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole beam; an unfolding stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tensor ply; and a stretching stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tensor ply. At <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact,</b> <b>the</b> whole beam undergoes elastic deformation until <b>the</b> breakage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cover and carrying plies; then the tensor ply left is unfolded and stretched to absorb more impact kinetic energy. In the unfolding stage, by adopting the rigid, perfectly plastic material idealization, a deformation mechanism with stationary plastic hinges is proposed. It is found that the static critical pressure first decreases then increases with the increasing central deflection. The static critical pressure varies with the geometric parameters, but the total energy dissipated in the unfolding stage is independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geometric parameters. The residual kinetic energy at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> unfolding stage will be dissipated by the plastic stretching. <b>The</b> dynamic responses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tensor skin are analyzed for step loaded pressure and rectangular pressure pulse. It is verified that the theoretical predictions display very good agreement with the corresponding finite element simulations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Background: Lithium {{has proven}} suicide {{preventing}} effects in <b>the</b> long-term treatment <b>of</b> patients with affective disorders. Clinical evidence from case {{reports indicate that}} this effect may occur early on at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> lithium treatment. <b>The</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> lithium treatment on acute suicidal thoughts and/or behavior has not been systematically studied in a controlled trial. <b>The</b> primary objective <b>of</b> this confirmatory study {{is to determine the}} association between lithium therapy and acute suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior in inpatients with a major depressive episode (MDE, unipolar and bipolar disorder according to DSM IV criteria). The specific aim is to test the hypothesis that lithium plus treatment as usual (TAU), compared to placebo plus TAU, results in a significantly greater decrease in suicidal ideation and/or behavior over 5 weeks in inpatients with MDE. Methods/Design: We initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Patients with <b>the</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> a moderate to severe depressive episode and suicidal thoughts and/or suicidal behavior measured with the Sheehan-Suicidality-Tracking Scale (S-STS) will be randomly allocated to add lithium or placebo to their treatment as usual.

Discussion: There is an urgent need to identify treatments that will acutely decrease suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> this study will demonstrate whether lithium reduces suicidal ideation and behavior within the first 5 weeks of treatment...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this paper}} is to examine <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> audit failure on Big 4 audit firm {{monitoring}} activities. The paper analyzes changes in discretionary accruals (DAs) among clients of firms implicated in audit failure events and examines whether these DAs decline in the period following the event. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses archival data and regression analyses to test whether DAs for clients of implicated audit firms decline in the period following the audit failure as compared to clients of other Big 4 firms. Audit failures are identified during the years 1996 - 2004 based on significant lawsuit settlements. The paper focuses on an office-level analysis to control for audit quality differences which may vary across firm geographic locations as suggested by recent research. Findings – Empirical results indicate that auditor response to audit failure has changed over time. Auditors implicated in audit failure events occurring in the post-Enron and Sarbanes-Oxley period enforce more conservative accounting choices in the year following the event. Specifically, clients <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implicated firm's office report a significant decline in discretionary accounting accruals relative to clients of other auditors in the same city location. However, a significant change in client discretionary accounting accruals is not found following audit failures that occurred prior to 2001, <b>the</b> year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enron bankruptcy. Originality/value – <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> this paper extend <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> litigation pressure on audit quality. Additionally, this paper helps address <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> how large-scale audit failures witnessed at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century have <b>impacted</b> audit firm conservatism.

Human <b>impact</b> on these species is however hard to establish, mainly {{due to lack of}} information on marine mammal population ecology, density, distribution and diversity. This project aims to gain further knowledge on <b>the</b> viability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harbour porpoise and harbour seal populations in the North Sea (focusing mainly on its southern Bight) through - <b>The</b> characterisation <b>of</b> their genetic structure and diversity (through mtDNA and microsatellites in harbour porpoises) - A better understanding of their feeding ecology (through d 13 C and d 15 N measurements in muscles) - <b>The</b> assessment <b>of</b> their susceptibility of being trapped accidentally in fishing nets (post-mortem investigations) Harbour porpoise and harbour seal occupied the top trophic levels but displayed different feeding habits as inferred from their d 13 C and d 15 N mean values. Harbour porpoises displayed lower mean d 15 N values suggesting a lower trophic position likely oriented towards small planktivorous fish such as herring and lesser sandeel. However, both their recent high abundance and their dietary preferences might lead to a higher susceptibility to by-catch as revealed by <b>the</b> significant emergence <b>of</b> net entrapment and net marks revealed by post-mortem investigations. The question rises about <b>the</b> sustainability <b>of</b> these incidental captures. Furthermore, genetic investigations revealed a higher fragmentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> porpoises collected along <b>the</b> coast <b>of</b> France, Belgium and Netherlands. This apparent fragmentation is of particular importance from a conservation point of view and enhances the fact to protect in priority these last populations.

40|$|In early 1998, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) {{was asked}} to assist the PROGRESA {{administration}} to “determine if PROGRESA is functioning in practice as {{it is intended to}} by design. ” This document summarizes the findings contained in a series of reports presented by IFPRI to PROGRESA from November 1998 through August 2000. A more detailed description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research, rationale and methods appears in <b>the</b> list <b>of</b> supporting documents from which this document has been derived. In brief, <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> IFPRI’s evaluation are that after just three years, <b>the</b> poor children <b>of</b> Mexico in <b>the</b> rural areas where PROGRESA is currently operating are more likely to enroll in school, are eating more diversified diets, getting more frequent health care and learning that the future may look quite different from the past. <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evaluation findings suggest that PROGRESA’s combination of education, health, and nutrition interventions into one integrated package can be an effective means <b>of</b> breaking <b>the</b> intergenerational transmission <b>of</b> poverty. However, PROGRESA is still in its <b>beginning</b> stages. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program are likely to manifest themselves in the future. Clearly, the simultaneous intervention in the health and nutrition of 0 to 5 year old children of poor households today will positively reinforce school attendance, performance and attainment of children tomorrow. Thus, in addition to the benefits measured after three years of operation, it is likely that PROGRESA will have additional benefits in future years. Whether <b>the</b> vicious cycle <b>of</b> poverty and its intergenerational transmission are indeed broken can only be determined by continuing with PROGRESA and continuing to evaluate in the medium and long run its <b>impact</b> on <b>the</b> livelihood <b>of</b> Mexico’s poor. <b>The</b> possibility <b>of</b> expanding <b>the</b> coverage <b>of</b> PROGRESA to poor households in urban areas implies that there is opportunity to use program evaluation, such as that presented herein, as a means to adapt some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program to suit <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> households in different environments. The IFPRI research team would encourage Mexico’s policy leaders to capitalize on the innovative precedent established by PROGRESA and to consider program evaluation as an indispensable component of all social policies.

40|$|The {{economic}} crisis at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eighties <b>impacted</b> 20 th-century Costa Rica {{in many different}} ways. Government programs were successful in reducing <b>the</b> proportion <b>of</b> poor people from 35 % in 1985 to 23 % in 2000. This article utilizes official Household Surveys corresponding to the period 1981 - 2002 and Population Censuses to perform an estimation of age, cohort, and period effects, {{in order to show}} that poverty among the elderly can be understood as a cohort effect. Their poverty conditions are associated with their low schooling, mainly among men. <b>The</b> probability <b>of</b> having <b>the</b> right to a retirement pension and the fact that individuals with lower educational levels earned low income during their later working years, intervene in the relationship between schooling and poverty as a cohort effect. Soon after <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil war in 1948, Costa Rica underwent political and economic changes that aided <b>the</b> expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social benefits initialized in the 40 ’s, such as universalizing Social Security, promoting health and educational policy, and providing infrastructure and services to both rural and urban communities. Nevertheless, at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 70 ’s, increasing oil prices had a strong negative impact on many countries around the world. Costa Rica was no exception, and during the 1980 – 1982 period it went through an {{economic crisis}} characterized by hyperinflation, increased unemployment and underemployment rates, and <b>the</b> declaration <b>of</b> a moratorium on foreign debt payments (Barahona Montero 1999 a). The governments after 1982 were relatively successful in promoting economic recovery by changing the development model based on import substitution to one promoting non-traditional product exports and tourism (Barahona Montero 1999 a, González Mejía 1999). In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recovery and public policies designed to combat poverty, since 1991, it has not been possible to reduce <b>the</b> proportion <b>of</b> poor households below 18 %, maintaining an annual average of around 20 %. 2 In addition, economists consider that within this one-fifth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation’s population, there is a group of “hard-core poor”, i. e., persons who systematically live on a minimal income, and who cannot easily climb out of their chronic condition (Proyecto Estado de la Nación-PEN 2002). One group in which <b>the</b> proportion <b>of</b> poor is relatively high with regard to <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population is that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elderly: 31 % of individuals 65 or more years of age live in households with incomes below the poverty line, according to the 2002 Encuesta de Hogares (National Household Survey). <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> this paper is to show that if poverty among the elderly is associated with structural characteristics within this group <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population, its incidence can be represented as a cohort effect. In other words, a large percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Costa Rican elderly would be living in poverty, not because old age leads to poverty, but because the characteristics that they acquired throughout their lives – given the historical moments they lived – make them more susceptible to being poor, in comparison with other groups born more recently. In order to provide separate estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cohort, age, and period effects, we consolidated the Encuestas de Hogares from 1980 to 2002, whose basic dependent variable is <b>the</b> proportion <b>of</b> persons living in poor households. The paper presents variations of these effects produced by <b>the</b> inclusion <b>of</b> certain independent variables in the model, in particular <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> education <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cohorts. It also emphasizes <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic crisis at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 80 ’s on <b>the</b> incidence <b>of</b> poverty among <b>the</b> elderly, and at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper, we relate this phenomenon to educational levels among these generations and their access to Social Security...|$|R
