40|$|Index {{number is}} useful when the {{measurements}} are in different units, {{and it can}} be applied to different sectors of economic activity, as well as having many other applications. A main aim {{of this study is to}} construct national index numbers for both the agricultural production and ex-farm prices for agricultural production of the agriculture sector of Iraq and to evaluate these indices during the period of the study. These indices are used instead of the indices that are constructed by Central Statistical Organization of Iraq using the Laspeyres formula, to find direct index number. This index is facing some problems: 1) It cannot be used over a long period of time. 2) The list of items cannot be add or deducted from. Therefore, to avoid these problems the chain index number is used in this study. The Fisher formula is used in calculations to give results which can be maintained to be unbiased because Laspeyres formula has an upward biased result and Paasche result is downward biased. The chain Fisher index number with a moving average is employed to avoid the effects <b>of</b> the <b>undetermined</b> <b>factors</b> on the construction of index number. The effects of the annual temperature as one <b>of</b> the <b>undetermined</b> <b>factors</b> is tested. The moving average on which the construction of index number depends as weight is tested to explain the <b>undetermined</b> <b>factors.</b> The index number of production is used to find the productivity of the cultivated area for annually growing crops. The relation between the productivity, cultivated area indices, production indices and ex-farm prices is tested depending on the test hypothesis for the rank correlation coefficient for all these indicators...|$|R

Although the cases of brain abscesses associated with congenital PAVM are very rare, the brain abscess could be an initial clinical manifestation in asymptomatic PAVM {{as in the case}} presented in this report.

40|$|An {{alternative}} {{expression for}} the length operator in loop quantum gravity is presented. The operator is background independent, symmetric, positive semidefinite, and well defined on the kinematical Hilbert space. The expression for the regularized length operator can moreover be understood both from a simple geometrical perspective as the average of a formula relating the length to area, volume and flux operators, and also consistently {{as the result of}} direct substitution of the densitized triad operator with the functional derivative operator into the regularized expression of the length. Both these derivations are discussed, and the origin <b>of</b> an <b>undetermined</b> overall <b>factor</b> in each case is also elucidated.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the rabbit {{papilloma}} virus upon tar tumor tissue are widely various, as the present paper and previous ones attest. It enables some of the benign tar tumors of domestic rabbits (papillomas, carcinomatoids) to establish themselves after implantation,—which {{they are unable to}} do under ordinary circumstances, being dependent upon favoring factors; and it may drive them to active proliferation without altering their morphology. Some growths it fails to influence and some it converts into virus papillomas. Often, however, it brings about cytological changes which are indicative of a combination of its influence with that <b>of</b> the <b>undetermined</b> <b>factor</b> motivating the original tumor. The resulting neoplasm exhibits a blend of characteristics. The virus makes some benign tar tumors become cancerous forthwith, the malignancy developing without intermediate virus papillomatosis. It can be readily imposed upon some of the squamous cell carcinomas which tar elicits in its natural host, the cottontail rabbit, and it may drive such tumors to proliferate faster, or alter them morphologically, or do both. Its stimulating effect is especially pronounced in the case of those tar cancers that are slow-growing. Since the virus can influence tar cancers markedly, one can scarcely suppose it to be devoid of effect upon the cancers of the same type which derive from the papillomas it has itself engendered. Other implications of the work are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Although anal cancers {{are up to}} {{four times}} more common in women than men, {{little is known about}} the natural history of anal human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) infections and HPV-related anal lesions in women. This study reports on the prevalence of and risks for anal cytological abnormalities over a 1 -year period in a cohort of young women participating in a study of the natural history of cervical HPV infection. In addition to their regularly scheduled sexual behavior interviews and cervical testing, consenting women received anal HPV DNA and cytological testing. Anal cytology smears were obtained from 410 women whose mean age was 22. 5 6 2. 5 years at the onset of the study. Sixteen women (3. 9 %) were found to have abnormal anal cytology: 4 women had low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) or condyloma; and 12 women had atypical cells <b>of</b> <b>undetermined</b> significance. <b>Factors</b> found to be significantly associated with abnormal anal cytology were a history of anal sex [odds ratio (OR), 6. 90; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 7 – 47. 2], a history of cervical SILs (OR, 4. 13; 95 % CI, 1. 3 – 14. 9), and a current anal HPV infection (OR, 12. 28; 95 % CI, 3. 9 – 43. 5). The strong association between anal intercourse and the development of HPV-induced SILs supports the role of sexual transmission of HPV in anal SILs. Young women who had engaged in anal intercourse or had a history of cervical SILs were found to be at highest risk...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamical}} spin response of doped two-leg Hubbard-like ladders {{in the framework}} of a low-energy effective field theory description given by the SO(6) Gross Neveu model. Using the integrability of the SO(6) Gross-Neveu model, we derive the low energy dynamical magnetic susceptibility. The susceptibility is characterized by an incommensurate coherent mode near (π,π) and by broad two excitation scattering continua at other k-points. In our computation we are able to estimate the relative weights of these contributions. All calculations are performed using form-factor expansions which yield exact low energy results {{in the context of the}} SO(6) Gross-Neveu model. To employ this expansion, a number <b>of</b> hitherto <b>undetermined</b> form <b>factors</b> were computed. To do so, we developed a general approach for the computation of matrix elements of semi-local SO(6) Gross-Neveu operators. While our computation takes place in the context of SO(6) Gross-Neveu, we also consider the effects of perturbations away from an SO(6) symmetric model, showing that small perturbations at best quantitatively change the physics.

40|$|Seven living-related liver transplants (LRLT) and two reduced-size liver transplants (RSLT) were {{performed}} on eight children who suffered from end- stage liver disease, having previously undergone one to three abdominal operations. Their ages at initial transplantation ranged from 8 months to 11 years (mean 35 months, median 12 months). Excluding the two older children aged 7 and 11 years, respectively, {{the rest of the}} children weighed 6 to 9. 5 kg (mean 7. 3 kg) {{at the time of the}} initial transplantation. Seven left lateral segments (S 2 + 3) and two left lobes (S 2 + 3 + 4) were used; of these the smallest graft had a graft-to-recipient body weight ratio of 0. 9 %. The volunteer living donors were four mothers, two fathers and one sister who were selected after medical and psychiatric evaluations, and their suitability was confirmed by hematological, biochemical, and radiological criteria. During a follow-up period of 3 to 30 months, all eight children are alive and well with normal liver function, one of them having undergone a retransplant LRLT <b>because</b> <b>of</b> hepatitis <b>of</b> <b>undetermined</b> etiology following a RSLT 1. 5 years earlier. All seven donors had an uneventful postoperative course and were discharged on day 4 to 7 postoperatively. They have all resumed normal day-to-day activities. There were no complications in the donor group. A variety of complications occurred in the recipients, all of which were overcome. Operating microscope was used to perform all the arterial anastomoses using microvascular techniques. This method has proven to be a major factor in preventing arterial thrombosis even with the smallest of arterial anastomosis where a 1. 5 -mm diameter recipient artery was anastomosed to a 2. 5 -mm diameter donor hepatic artery. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Title of the {{bachelor}} thesis: Use of biomarkers for {{the diagnosis and}} prevention of preeclampsia and eclampsia Aim of the thesis: The aim of this thesis was to gain an overview of preeclampsia, to summarize the findings of laboratory examinations for the diagnosis of this disease and {{to focus on the}} biochemical markers necessary to recognize the disease. Main findings: Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disease, which today is a major complication <b>of</b> pregnancy. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> the <b>undetermined</b> etiology, neither the prediction nor the diagnosis of this disease is simple. The levels of some biomarkers, measurable in both blood and urine, make it easier to recognize the approaching disease before the first clinical manifestations. However, there is no factor that would reliably determine whether it is preeclampsia. Therefore, combinations of different markers are currently used. Conclusion: The number of markers shown here proves that {{it is not easy to}} define the most reliable ones.

IgG and IgA monoclonal gammopathy <b>of</b> <b>undetermined</b> significance are precursor conditions of multiple myeloma; light-chain monoclonal gammopathy <b>of</b> <b>undetermined</b> significance <b>of</b> light-chain multiple myeloma; and IgM monoclonal gammopathy <b>of</b> <b>undetermined</b> significance <b>of</b> Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and other lymphoproliferative disorders. Clonal burden, as determined by bone marrow plasma cell percentage or M-protein level, as well as biological characteristics, including heavy chain isotype and light chain production, are helpful in predicting risk of progression of monoclonal gammopathy <b>of</b> <b>undetermined</b> significance to symptomatic disease. Furthermore, alterations in the bone marrow microenvironment of monoclonal gammopathy <b>of</b> <b>undetermined</b> significance patients result in an increased risk of venous and arterial thrombosis, infections, osteoporosis, and bone fractures.

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{here the}} rare coexistence, {{at the time}} of diagnosis, of a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) in a 74 -year-old patient who presented with thrombocytosis and signs of portal hypertension on physical examination. Abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated extensive portal vein system thrombosis. Secondary causes of thrombocytosis were excluded. JAK 2 V 617 F mutation was present in the peripheral blood, while bone marrow biopsy revealed marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Molecular analysis failed to detect BCR–ABL rearrangement in peripheral blood cells. Simultaneous occurrence of MPN and NHL was diagnosed. This case may be of interest not only due to the rare coexistence of PMN and NHL, but also <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the <b>undetermined</b> clinical significance <b>of</b> JAK 2 mutation in this subset of patients. The coexistence of a lymphoproliferative and a myelo-proliferative neoplasm (MPN) is well documented following cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation, while it is rare prior to therapy (1). As far as polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocythemia (ET) are concerned, simultaneous or sequential occurrence with multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia has been reported in several cases (2 - 6) but the coexistence of PV or ET with malignant lymphoma in previously untreated patients is a rare event (7 - 9) and the etiologic association remains unclear. We report here a patient presented with extensive portal vein thrombosis.

Acute {{acquired}} comitant esotropia (AACE) can be {{a diagnostic}} challenge for ophthalmologists and neurologists <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its association with neurological pathologies. Our study describes a series of adult patients with AACE <b>of</b> <b>undetermined</b> etiology. Methods. Data on the clinical findings of patients presented with AACE <b>of</b> <b>undetermined</b> etiology with a minimum follow-up of 1 year were retrieved from the medical records and the results analyzed. Results. A series of 9 esotropia cases (age range: 20 – 43 years) was reviewed. All patients had full duction and versions, without an A-pattern or V-pattern. All patients had esotropia for distance and near. Neurological evaluation in all cases was normal. Among patients, 3 were treated with prisms, 4 were treated with strabismus surgery, and 1 was treated with botulinum toxin injections; 1 patient declined treatment. In treated patients posttreatment sensory testing indicated restoration of binocularity that remained stable throughout follow-up of 1 – 9 years. The patient that declined treatment had binocular function with base-out prisms. Conclusion. Acute onset esotropia may be seen without a neurological pathology in adults. Good motor and sensory outcomes {{can be a}}chieved in these patients with AACE <b>of</b> <b>undetermined</b> etiology via surgical and nonsurgical methods...|$|R

The {{flower induction}} treatments {{are essential to the}} pineapple production for economical and social reasons. For conventional agriculture, many chemicals are available but for organic farming ethylene is the only allowed product. A new flower induction method suited to small organic growers has been developed by the Pesticides Initiative Programme of the Coleacp funded by the European Development Fund. The trials conducted proved that the method reaches more than 80 % efficiency at 10 weeks for the different application methods evaluated. The wet application trials show a doses response effect as well as effect of the application replication at 2 days interval. The flowering rate culminates at 100 % after 8 weeks for the best results, obtained with the wet treatment at 250 mg per plant applied two times at 2 days interval. The different dry treatments tested gave all 85 – 90 % flowering rates at 10 weeks, suggesting the presence <b>of</b> an <b>undetermined</b> limitation <b>factor</b> in the conditions prevailing for the trial.
