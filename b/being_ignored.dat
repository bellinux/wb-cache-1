5|$|Although Z. Marcas {{features}} {{characters from}} other Balzac stories and elements of literary realism– both hallmarks of Balzac's style– it is remembered primarily for its political themes. Balzac, a legitimist, believed that France's lack of bold leadership {{had led to}} mediocrity and ruin, and that men of quality were <b>being</b> <b>ignored</b> or worse. He maintained that the youth of France {{were in danger of}} being abandoned by the government, and predicted unrest in the years to come.|$|E
5|$|For Braun the {{manuscript}} was fortuitous. Initially {{the sales of}} Max and Moritz were slow, but sales figures improved after the 1868 second edition. Overall there were 56 editions and more than 430,000 copies sold up to Busch's death in 1908. Despite at first <b>being</b> <b>ignored</b> by critics, teachers in the 1870s described Max and Moritz as frivolous and an undesirable influence on the moral development of young people.|$|E
5|$|In Moscow, Kennan again {{felt that}} his {{opinions}} were <b>being</b> <b>ignored</b> by Harry S. Truman and policymakers in Washington. Kennan tried repeatedly to persuade policymakers to abandon plans for {{cooperation with the}} Soviet government {{in favor of a}} sphere of influence policy in Europe to reduce the Soviets' power there. Kennan believed that a federation needed to be established in western Europe to counter Soviet influence in the region and to compete against the Soviet stronghold in eastern Europe.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} {{scientific}} exchange, the Maud Committee's findings were conveyed to the United States. One of its members, the Australian physicist Mark Oliphant, flew to the United States in late August 1941 and discovered that data provided by the Maud Committee had not reached key American physicists. Oliphant then {{set out to find}} out why the committee's findings were apparently <b>being</b> <b>ignored.</b> He met with the Uranium Committee and visited Berkeley, California, where he spoke persuasively to Ernest O. Lawrence. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. He in turn spoke to James B. Conant, Arthur H. Compton and George B. Pegram. Oliphant's mission was therefore a success; key American physicists were now aware of the potential power of an atomic bomb.|$|E
5|$|After the {{groundbreaking}} opticals of Star Wars, The Motion Pictures producers realized the film required similarly high-quality visuals. Douglas Trumbull, a film director with an excellent reputation in Hollywood {{who had worked}} on , was the first choice for director of special effects, but declined the offer. When approached, Trumbull was busy on Close Encounters, and was tired of <b>being</b> <b>ignored</b> as a director and having to churn out special effects for someone else's production; after completing the effects work, Trumbull planned on launching his own feature using a new film process. The next choice, John Dykstra, was similarly wrapped up in other projects. Post-production supervisor Paul Rabwin suggested Robert Abel's production company Robert Abel and Associates might {{be up to the}} task. The scope and size of the effects grew after the television movie became The Motion Picture. Abel and Associates bid $4million for doing the film's effects and Paramount accepted. As new effects were added, Abel increased their bid by $750,000, and Roddenberry suggested that the effects costs and schedules be reexamined.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s Shafarevich, with Valery Chalidze, Grigori Podyapolski and Andrei Tverdokhlebov, {{became one}} of Sakharov's human rights investigators, and was {{consequently}} dismissed from Moscow University.

25|$|After hearing {{reports of}} other racial issues, the Mexican {{government}} asked General Manuel Mier y Teran {{to investigate the}} outcome of the 1825 colonization law in Texas.

25|$|It {{unfortunately}} {{appears to}} us, and many residents of Bay County, that Dr. Siebert {{has become a}} scapegoat for those seeking a political solution to recent events, rather than a logical resolution based upon science and fact.

25|$|There {{appears to}} be as much {{confusion}} about smart adherence technology as there is whenever a new technology comes on stream. Overzealous journalists tend to confuse science fiction with reality. Marketers and PR departments over promise and engineering and product departments under deliver. In the end, if a fair balance isn't struck between a feasible cost effective solution and unrealistic expectations derived from over confident presentations, the entire field of smart adherence monitoring is in danger of <b>being</b> <b>ignored.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} {{about his work}} was renewed in 1962. That year, ESPLA's new manager, Mihai Gafița, decided against publishing Aderca's three-volume biographical study on Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, on which the aging writer had reportedly been working since 1948. This reaction greatly upset Aderca. He appeal to the highest authority, Communist Party leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, asking him to reassess the text's ideological substance. He noted that another one of his texts, a reportage piece about workers in the Magyar Autonomous Region, was also <b>being</b> <b>ignored</b> by Gafița.|$|E

Similarly, the culture is also ill-equipped to deal with the news that a previously hyped treatment or screening procedure has been determined to be ineffective, with women advocating for the acceptance and promotion of inexpedient activities and inefficient or even sometimes harmful drugs.|$|E
