Such groupings {{reduce the number of}} degrees of freedom, which can result in a significant reduction of computational time. As benchmarks, we consider global optimization for the tryptophan zipper (trpzip 1, 1 LE 0; using the CHARMM force field) and chignolin (1 UAO; using the AMBER force field). We use a basin-hopping algorithm to find the global minima and compute the mean first encounter time from random starting configurations with and without the local rigid <b>body</b> <b>framework.</b> Minimal groupings are used, where only peptide bonds, termini, and side chain rings are considered rigid. Finding the global minimum is 4. 2 and 2. 5 times faster, respectively, for trpzip 1 and chignolin, within the local rigid <b>body</b> <b>framework.</b> We further compare O(105) low-lying local minima to the fully relaxed unconstrained representation for trpzip 1 at different levels of rigidification. The resulting Pearson correlation coefficients, and thus the apparent intrinsic rigidity of the various groups, appear in the following order: side chain rings > termini > trigonal planar centers ≥ peptide bonds side chains.

40|$|AbstractFor over 100 {{years there}} has been a known {{correspondence}} between plane pictures of spherical polyhedra and static stresses in bar and joint frameworks with planar graphs. We define a new map from any plane picture of a general scene to a corresponding plate and bar framework in the plane. This map, and its return map, give a simple isomorphism between the space of scenes over the picture and the space of instantaneous motions of the framework. When two simple equivalence relations on the pictures and on the frameworks are introduced, the maps define an isomorphism of the equivalence clases which permits the full translation of questions, techniques and theorems between the two fields of study. A direct geometric interpretation of this correspondence is described and an extension to systems with occlusion and tensegrity (systems of inequalities) is presented. The analogous patterns in higher dimensions are described, yielding a correspondence between motions of bar and <b>body</b> <b>frameworks</b> in 3 -space and 6 -dimensional scenes over 5 -dimensional pictures...|$|R

The <b>body</b> <b>framework</b> of cattle and condition were investigated with regular month intervals during the year 2007. Body condition was considered in an interval from 1 to 5 points with accuracy of 0, 25 point. During the watching years milk yield increased from 6 616 kg to 8 507 kg. Milk components reduced with increasing milk yield, when the contents of fat was gradually reduced from initial 4, 2 % to 3, 87 %. The contens of proteins was also reduced from 3, 5 % to 3, 37 %. It was investigated that the decline of body condition after calving was connected with extension of insemination interval and service period by six days and its increase with shortening of interval and SP by four days. The higher milk yield (8 281 kg) {{but at the same time}} longer service period was investigated with cows of bigger <b>body</b> <b>framework</b> (the hight in back from 145 to 150 cm).

The highest milk yield was investigated with cows at the second lactation period (7 900 kg), at the third lactation period was almost on the same level (7 886 kg) and in the following lactation periods the quantity of milk gradually fell down.

40|$|Object {{detection}} is a {{big challenge}} for researchers to address the issues that affect accurate detections. The Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) descriptors have been used extensively for object detection on challenging conditions with good results. However, occlusion remains a well-known issue where some parts of an object are only visible. Conventional frameworks using HOG descriptors for detecting whole human body are prone to occluded people and thus causing errors on implementations running these frameworks. This issue was addressed in different approaches like hybrid feature extraction algorithms. Rather than following such approaches, the problem is addressed in this research by redefining HOG descriptors {{to work in a}} part object (body) detection framework that is powered by a finite-state machine. Experiments were conducted to test a new method of extracting HOG descriptors for parts of human body via slicing a window’s HOG descriptor into four. The part body detection framework utilises each part’s descriptor whereas three detected parts are sufficient to declare that the window has an assumed instance. Support vector machines (SVM) were used to classify the extracted parts and a finite- state machine was employed for handling the detected parts. Training and testing were made on subsets from the INRIA Person Dataset and the results favoured the part body detection framework over the conventional whole <b>body</b> <b>framework.</b> For a test set of 50 positive images of occluded people, the part body detection framework successfully detected 46 true positive while the whole <b>body</b> <b>framework</b> detected 36.

40|$|This paper explores {{notions of}} professionalism amongst {{vocational}} {{teachers in the}} UK and Australia, through an analysis of voluntarism/regulatory <b>frameworks</b> and professional <b>body</b> <b>frameworks.</b> In terms of empirical evidence, the paper reports on data drawn from a documentary analysis of government policy documents, standards {{for the education of}} teachers, and regulatory frameworks in both countries. It is located within a broad range of literature exploring contemporary concepts of professionalism amongst vocational teachers. Documentary analysis implies that whilst there is an expectation and assumption that vocational teachers are, and should be, professional, this is not necessarily translated through Initial Teacher Training requirements, some of which fail to address concepts of professionalism at all. Further, it offers evidence to suggest that where notions of professionalism are addressed, the concept is described in largely reductive and utilitarian terms, and that this is the case in both countries. The paper considers the implications of this for teachers, students, and wider practice within the sector, arguing that meaningful understandings of the notion of professional, which are effectively applied in practice, are fundamental to broader understandings of key issues in further education, such as those associated with in/equalities and in/exclusion in education contexts. The paper concludes that such understandings are unlikely to be drawn from utilitarian, CBT based teacher-training programmes...|$|R

The local rigid <b>body</b> <b>framework</b> {{results in a}} substantial computational speedup by effectively reducing {{the total number of}} degrees of freedom.

In general, the melting transition, as well as the precise sequence of folding events, is accurately reproduced with conservative local rigidification. However, aggressive rigidification leads to increased topological frustration and a concomitant slowing down of the global kinetics. Our results suggest that an optimal choice of local rigidification, and perhaps a hierarchical approach, could be very useful for investigating complex pathways in biomolecules. J. A.
