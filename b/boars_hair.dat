50|$|<b>Boar's</b> <b>hair</b> brushes are {{relatively}} inexpensive, {{but can be}} of very high quality. A well-made boar brush will break in with use; the bristles begin to split at their tips, resulting in a brush that is very soft but has considerable backbone. Unlike badger hair and synthetic fibers, boar bristles absorb water, so the brush should be soaked before use.|$|R

40|$|Stable isotope {{measurements}} {{are increasingly being}} used to gain insights into the nutritional ecology of many wildlife species and their role in ecosystem structure and function. Such studies require estimations of trophic discrimination factors (i. e. differences in the isotopic ratio between the consumer and its diet). Although trophic discrimination factors are tissue- and species-specific, researchers often rely on generalized, and fixed trophic discrimination factors {{that have not been}} experimentally derived. In this experimental study, captive wild boar (Sus scrofa) were fed a controlled diet of corn (Zea mays), a popular and increasingly dominant food source for wild boar in the Czech Republic and elsewhere in Europe, and trophic discrimination factors for stable carbon (Δ 13 C) and nitrogen (Δ 15 N) isotopes were determined from hair samples. The mean Δ 13 C and Δ 15 N in wild <b>boar</b> <b>hair</b> were - 2. 3 ‰ and + 3. 5 ‰, respectively. Also, in order to facilitate future derivations of isotopic measurements along wild <b>boar</b> <b>hair,</b> we calculated the average hair growth rate to be 1. 1 mm d(- 1). Our results serve as a baseline for interpreting isotopic patterns of free-ranging wild boar in current European agricultural landscapes. However, future research is needed in order to provide a broader understanding of the processes underlying the variation in trophic discrimination factors of carbon and nitrogen across of variety of diet types...|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} Opinels have been offered over the years. A few are sold more for their novelty value than for practical purposes, such as Le Géant. Besides the Slim Effile series and the Couteau du Jardin, Opinel also offers a hawkbill-bladed pruning knife designed {{for use in the}} garden or vineyard, and a large folding wood saw with locking blade using the same Virobloc mechanism as found on large Opinel knives. For the kitchen, the company sells vegetable peelers, chefs knives, paring knives, knives with corkscrews (couteau tire-bouchon), and prep knives for the kitchen, including a mushroom knife (couteau à champignon), with an integral <b>boar's</b> <b>hair</b> cleaning brush.|$|R
25|$|The {{first patent}} for a {{toothbrush}} was granted to H.N. Wadsworth in 1857 (U.S.A. Patent No. 18,653) in the United States, but mass {{production in the}} United States did not start until 1885. The improved design had a bone handle with holes bored into it for the Siberian <b>boar</b> <b>hair</b> bristles. Unfortunately, animal bristle was not an ideal material as it retained bacteria, did not desiccate efficiently and the bristles were often extricated from their intended fixed insertions. In addition to bone, handles were made of wood or ivory. In the United States, brushing teeth did not become routine until after World War II, when American soldiers had to clean their teeth daily.|$|R
50|$|Modern day toothbrushing as {{a regular}} habit became {{prevalent}} in Europe after contact with the Muslim world in Africa and Asia where the people's teeth remained healthy into old age. It was advised as a scientifically supported practice {{toward the end of}} the 17th century. The modern toothbrush was developed in England in 1780. While languishing in jail, Thomas Addis decided to drill holes into a sheep's tibia, and pulled through the bristles of <b>boar</b> <b>hair.</b> While he was credited with the discovery of the modern toothbrush, a similar design has since been discovered in China from 1400. In the United States, although toothbrushes were available at the end of the 19th century, the practice did not become widespread until after the Second World War, when U.S. soldiers continued the toothbrushing that had been required during their military service.|$|R

Its importance in the Japanese diet was such that it was exempt from Emperor Tenmu's ban on meat-eating in 675.|$|R
50|$|Wild boar hunting (vanatoarea la mistret) (Sus scrofa) is {{the most}} common big game sport in Romania; wild boar is often used for meat as well as for trophies (conventionally the male tusks only, but also {{shoulder}} mounts, female tusks, silver hat pins with <b>boar</b> bristles or <b>hair</b> or even skins and rugs).|$|R
50|$|The boar as {{a warrior}} also appears in Scandinavian, Germanic and Anglo-Saxon culture, with its image having been {{frequently}} engraved on helmets, shields and swords. According to Tacitus, the Baltic Aesti featured boars on their helmets, {{and may have}} also worn boar masks. The boar and pig were held in particularly high esteem by the Celts, who considered them to be their most important sacred animal. Some Celtic deities linked to boars include Moccus and Veteris. It {{has been suggested that}} some early myths surrounding the Welsh hero Culhwch involved the character being the son of a boar god. Nevertheless, the importance of the boar as a culinary item among Celtic tribes may have been exaggerated in popular culture by the Asterix series, as wild boar bones are rare among Celtic archaeological sites, and the few that occur show no signs of butchery, having probably been used in sacrificial rituals. The boar also appears in Vedic mythology. A story present in the Brāhmaṇas has Indra slaying an avaricious boar, who has stolen the treasure of the asuras, then giving its carcass to Vishnu, who offered it as a sacrifice to the gods. In the story's retelling in the Charaka Samhita, the boar is described as a form of Prajāpti, and is credited with having raised the earth from the primeval waters. In the Rāmāyaṇa and the Purāṇas, the same boar is portrayed as an avatar of Vishnu.In Japanese culture, the boar is widely seen as a fearsome and reckless animal, to the point that several words and expressions in Japanese referring to recklessness include references to boars.

5000|$|The modern {{shaving brush}} may {{be traced to}} France during the 1750s. The French call a shaving brush blaireau or [...] "badger." [...] Quality of these brushes {{differed}} greatly, as materials used to fashion the handles varied from the common to the exotic. It was not uncommon for handles {{to be made of}} ivory, gold, silver, tortoise shell, crystal, or porcelain. The more expensive brushes used badger hair, with cheaper ones using <b>boar's</b> or horse's <b>hair.</b> In the 1800s when the folding-handle straight razor design made it practical for men to shave themselves rather than visit a barber, a shave brush became a status symbol, and an expensive or eccentric brush was a way of asserting one's personality or even affluence. The recent rapid rise in the popularity of [...] "wet shaving" [...] has raised demand for high quality and custom shaving brushes.|$|R
40|$|Orrido di Botri Natural Reserve and Orecchiella Natural Park {{are placed}} on the Tuscan side of the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines National Park, located at {{different}} altitudes (from 800 to 2054 m a. s. l.); 90 - 95 % of its territory is dominated by woodland and the remaining area is grazing/pasture. This area is rich in red deer (Cervus elaphus) 1, in mouflon (Ovis ammon ammon) 2. in wild boars {{and there is an}} increasing number of wolves (Canis lupus) that, in Italy, is a strictly protected specie. This trial was carried out from January to April 2008, through some different methods of study: 1) pellet count method, walking twice a month along nine transepts, georeferenced trough Arc View 3. 2 (five transects in the Orecchiella Reserve and four transects in the Orrido di Botri; transects were differently placed: four were at low altitude (1000 - 1300 a. s. l.) for a total of 36 km, four were at a medium altitude (1300 - 1500 a. s. l.) for a total of 24 km, and one was at high altitude (1500 - 2000 a. s. l.) for a total of 6 km; 2) pellet composition; 3) snow tracking, within 24 h from the fall of the snow, to facilitate the findings of the footsteps on the same transect described above 3; 4) wolf-howling, before sunrise and after sunset of those days characterised by a wind speed lower than 12 km/h; 5) occasional findings of sign of predation, sleeping site, and so on. Data are reported in a database Excel and analysed for average value. The pellet count method permitted to find a total of 50 excrements definitely attributable to wolves (diameters equal or more than 2. 5 cm) 4 : the higher total number were found in the Orecchiella Park (32 vs 18). If the comparison is done on the length of the transects, results are opposite because we find an average value of 1. 52 pellet in Orecchiella Natural Park and an average of 4. 5 in Orrido di Botri Reserve: this fact is explaining since this last area is very wild and unfrequented by man, being an excellent refuge for this animal 5. Independently from the two different areas, the highest number of pellet was recorded in the ecotone ambient (22 pellets) followed by pasture (10 pellet), beech (9), chestnuts (2) and meadow (1). Even the altitude modifies the findings of pellet: only 2 were find in the highest zone, 25 in the medium and 23 in the lower zone, probably because at the highest altitude there was a lower number of the animal preyed by wolf. As regard pellet composition, in 17 pellets there was wild ruminant ungulates hair (roe and red deer, mouflon), in 13 there was wild <b>boar</b> <b>hair,</b> in 12 there were traces of bones and only in 8 there were even grass of various type; the fact that we find only wild ungulates hair is explainable from the fact that, in this zone, there is no presence of domestic animal like ovine and so on: in fact, {{it is well known that}} wolves prefer to prey domestic animal, more easy to capture 6. Snow-tracking permitted to identify 8 wolf tracks on which we found fresh pellet, sleeping size, carcass preyed an other presence signals. From the observation of the footsteps it was possible to deduce the presence of one male and two females. Wolf-howling is the method that, in our case, gives the worst result: in fact only one time wolves reply to the registered howl, but the obtained result is in agreement with the one of snow-tracking as regards the number of wolves. In conclusion, results of this first trial confirm the presence of a little pack of wolves that find the optimal condition for living in the studied areas...|$|R
40|$|International audienceReliable {{estimation}} of population size remains {{a major challenge}} in wildlife ecology and management. Lately, genotyping of non-invasively obtained tissue samples integrated in a modified capture–recapture approach provides new perspectives. Faeces, moulted feathers, or hairs can be easily sampled in the field. However, an important assumption is homogeneity of sampling across the population. In this pilot study, we tested the suitability of baited barbed wire hair sampling stations (‘hair traps') for homogeneous genetic sampling for population estimation. A video system based on a new network internet protocol was used to observe the behaviour of wild <b>boar</b> visiting baited <b>hair</b> traps for gaining information about potential heterogeneities in the individual sampling probability. Within 92 monitoring nights at two sampling stations, 216 wild boar visits were recorded and 142 hair samples containing 2, 124 single hairs were collected. Video analysis revealed distinct differences in the behaviour of wild boar {{with respect to the}} sampling station which are most likely to result in heterogeneous individual sampling probabilities. Adult and subadult animals differed in their behaviour dependent on their group status. This result indicates that hair sampling with baited hair traps is not suitable for representative non-invasive sampling of free ranging wild boar populations...|$|R
