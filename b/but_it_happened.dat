The Indian Medical Service had suspended recruitment from 1860 <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> to restart in April 1865. King obtained an M.B. in 1865 and joined the Indian Medical Service on 2 October, carrying with him an Ipecacuanha plant from Hooker, left for India in March and reached Calcutta on 11 April 1866.|$|E
25|$|After Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni won the toss {{and elected}} to bat first, openers Murali Vijay and Mike Hussey {{put on an}} opening {{partnership}} of 87 until Vijay was dismissed for 42 (from 32 balls) in the 11th over. Mike Hussey was joined by IPL's leading run scorer Suresh Raina and they scored at a brisk rate to reach 160 when Hussey was dismissed in the eighteenth over for 54 (from 43 balls). Suresh Raina who had scored an imposing 73 (from 38 balls) with five sixes was dismissed off the last ball as Chennai reached a formidable total of 190. In reply, the Knight Riders lost their captain Gautam Gambhir cheaply for 2 in the first over. However, they recovered as Manvinder Bisla (89 from 48 balls) and Jacques Kallis (69 from 49 balls) added 136 for the second wicket. Soon after Bisla's dismissal in the 15th over, the Knight Riders lost wickets at regular intervals and after Kallis was caught out by Ravindra Jadeja off the bowling of Ben Hilfenhaus at 18.5 overs, the Knight Riders required 16 runs from the last 7 balls. Shakib Al Hasan {{appeared to have been}} caught by Murali Vijay off the very next delivery from Hilfenhaus <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> to be a no-ball and amid the celebrations, Shakib Al Hasan had completed two runs and retained the strike and hit a four the very next ball. Needing 9 runs to win from the last over, Manoj Tiwary hit consecutive fours to secure victory for the Knight Riders. Manvinder Bisla was declared Man of the Match for his 89 from 48 balls which included five sixes and eight fours.|$|E

Red Sox fans felt retribution as Dent was fired on their field, while players on the Yankees, including former Red Sox catcher Rick Cerone and Mattingly felt Dent {{was used as a}} scapegoat. Dan Shaughnessy criticized Steinbrenner for firing Dent in Boston and said he should [...] "have waited until the Yankees got to Baltimore" [...] to fire Dent. He said that [...] "if Dent had been fired in Seattle or Milwaukee, this would have been just another event in an endless line of George's jettisons. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> in Boston and the nightly news had its hook."

2500|$|In November 2011, Die Antwoord left Interscope Records over {{a dispute}} {{concerning}} their upcoming album and its lead single, [...] "Fok Julle Naaiers". Visser explained that Interscope [...] "kept pushing {{us to be}} more generic" [...] {{in order to make}} more money: [...] "If you try to make songs that other people like, your band will always be shit. You always gotta do what you like. If it connects, it's a miracle, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> with Die Antwoord." [...] Die Antwoord formed their own independent label, Zef Recordz, and released their new album Ten$Ion through it. The release was in association with the Good Smile Company (a Japanese company that is also making Die Antwoord toys) and Downtown Records, which is handling the marketing and distribution for the record worldwide. Ten$Ion included three more singles following [...] "Fok Julle Naaiers": [...] "I Fink U Freeky", [...] "Baby's on Fire", and [...] "Fatty Boom Boom". The singles included on Ten$Ion began to bring Die Antwoord more into the global spotlight as they were invited to perform on American talk shows and featured in an Alexander Wang advertisement. However the album was met with average to poor reviews by many critics. Ten$Ion was followed up with a non-album single, [...] "XP€N$IV $H1T".|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, the Red Sox {{would again}} win the {{division}} {{and face the}} Athletics in the ALCS. However, the outcome was the same, with the A's sweeping the ALCS in four straight. That same year, Yankees fans started to chant [...] "1918!" [...] to taunt the Red Sox. The demeaning chant would echo at Yankee Stadium each time the Red Sox were there. Also, Fenway Park became the scene of Bucky Dent's worst moment as a manager, although it was where he had his greatest triumph. In June, when the Red Sox swept the Yankees during a four-game series at Fenway Park, the Yankees fired Dent as their manager. Red Sox fans felt retribution to Dent being fired on their field, while the Yankees used him as a scapegoat. However, Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe severely criticized Yankees Owner George Steinbrenner for firing Dent—his 18th managerial change in as many years since becoming owner—in Boston and said he should [...] "have waited until the Yankees got to Baltimore" [...] to fire Dent.
