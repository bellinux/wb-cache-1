500|$|Wintour {{is often}} {{described}} as emotionally distant by those who have come to know her well, even her close friends. [...] "At some stage in her career, Anna Wintour stopped being Anna Wintour and became 'Anna Wintour,' at which point, like wings of a stately home, she closed off large sections of her personality to the public," [...] wrote The Guardian. [...] "I think she enjoys not being completely approachable. Just her office is very intimidating. You have to walk about a mile into the office <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> her desk and I'm sure it's intentional," [...] Coddington says. [...] "I don't find her to be accessible to people she doesn't need to be accessible to," [...] agrees Vogue publisher Tom Florio.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] said Mr. Dawson, {{giving a}} half glance over his {{shoulder}} as they struck into the dusty highway,--"I suppose you don't care to see anybody <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> San Jose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would have}} been more warmly wrapped up if you had lived long in Canada," [...] she replied. [...] "In spite of our stoves and hot bricks, you'll find {{yourself}} very cold <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> your journey's end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{best thing}} that can happen to that unhappy man is likely to happen," [...] he said. [...] "The one change in him is a change that threatens paralysis. You may hear of his death <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> back <b>to</b> England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll see {{how they}} live <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> back <b>to</b> Chicago," [...] said Ben, grimly; and then he added, in a {{softened}} voice, [...] "I'd like {{to see how it}} would seem to have a father an' a mother, an' a house to live in." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You'd better {{save your}} breath," [...] Doctor Sarson advised him grimly. [...] "You haven't any to spare now, and you'll {{want more than}} you have <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> {{the end of your}} journey. Carefully down the steps, mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall make}} my way to Ryswyk first and get a horse there. I shall follow you at a distance, and {{probably}} overtake you <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Leyden. But you will not see me after this ... unless there is trouble, which is not likely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll see <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> bed," [...] said Pinkerton. [...] "And now, {{after all}} this backwarding and forwarding, and that hotel clerk, and that bug Bellairs, it'll be a change {{and a kind of}} {{consolation}} to see the schooner. I guess things are humming there." ...|$|E

6000|$|THE THIRD MOTIVE.--If they seize upon <b>thee</b> <b>before</b> thou <b>get</b> <b>to</b> {{the city}} of Refuge, they will put an {{everlasting}} stop to thy journey. This also cries, Run for it! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That rather looks, father, as if {{the things}} were somewhere in England; had they been in India, {{you would have had}} them some months in your hands <b>before</b> <b>you</b> could <b>get</b> them <b>to</b> Amsterdam." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You say {{you want}} to know why you were cabled for. I'll tell you. There's no use talking for half a day <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the point. I guess you've heard that there's a prince here instead of a {{republic}} now? Well, that's where you come in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{forget the}} name of his cottage, sir, but I could show you in a second. It's one of those cottages just past the school gates, on the right as you turn out into the road. There are three in a row. His is the first you come to. There's a barn just <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is well, Maso," [...] said Romola, {{trying to}} speak in the calmest voice, and make the old man easy. [...] "Here is the wallet quite ready. You will go on quietly, and I shall not be far behind you. When {{you get out of}} the gates you may go more slowly, for I shall perhaps join you <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Trespiano." ...|$|E
60|$|The Third Motive. If they seize upon <b>thee</b> <b>before</b> thou <b>get</b> <b>to</b> {{the city}} of Refuge, they will put an {{everlasting}} stop to thy journey. This also cries, Run for it.|$|R
6000|$|... "That may be so, or not. You can't {{read his}} bosom quite distinctly;--but you may read your own. If {{you go into}} office you become the servant of the country,--not his servant, and should assume his motive in {{selecting}} {{you to be the}} same as your own in submitting to the selection. Your foot must be on the ladder <b>before</b> <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the top of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The question," [...] he explained, [...] "is complicated, but I {{think we}} have {{answered}} it already. I may add that {{it is unreasonable to}} expect a dividend on the first year's operations. Preliminary expenses are large, and a mine is not like a factory. The ground must, so to speak, be cleared <b>before</b> <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> <b>to</b> work. Headings must be driven and timbered, pumps and machines of various kinds have to be put up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Way over in England, Peggy, there's {{a county}} called Worcestershire. And {{somewhere near the}} edge of that there's a grey house with gables, and there's a lawn and a meadow and a shrubbery, and an orchard and a rose-garden, and a big cedar on the terrace <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the rose-garden. And if you climb to the top of that cedar, you can see the river through the apple trees in the orchard. And in the {{distance}} there are hills. And--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't like {{leaving them}} to themselves. Look here, Surajah, {{you go down}} to the stable, and mount at once. Tell the syce I shall come for my horse in a few minutes. Then ride out, and take your post where you can see them come out of the gate, and then follow them closely. I will stay here, and see them safely through the gate, and then mount and follow you. I shall {{overtake}} you <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the ford." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{been telling}} Mr. March {{here that you}} better both come to the parade with us. I guess my twospanner will hold five; or if it won't, we'll make it. I don't believe there's a {{carriage}} left in Wurzburg; {{and if you go}} in the cars, you'll have to walk three or four miles <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the parade-ground. You think it over," [...] he said to March. [...] "Nobody else is going to have the places, anyway, and you can say yes at the last minute just as well as now." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I'm the {{one that}} sits and is obsessive about it <b>before</b> <b>you</b> even <b>get</b> <b>to</b> hear it. As close as I <b>get</b> <b>to</b> it, I don't think I can {{physically}} torture myself that much, {{year in and year}} out, and expect it to fulfill me the way that it does and the way that it is right now. <b>You</b> just don't <b>get</b> that every day. You have to wait for it." [...] â€”Timberlake explaining his musical hiatus ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say," [...] said Mr. McQuirk, {{wheeling}} {{and shooting}} out a horizontal {{hand and a}} forty-five-degree chin, [...] "you know your place only when it comes for givin' titles. I've changed me mind about drinkin--see? You got your money, ain't you? Wait till <b>you</b> <b>get</b> stung <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the droop <b>to</b> your lip, will you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Married man,' says I, 'I {{know you}} was christened a fool {{the minute the}} preacher tangled you up, but don't you never {{sometimes}} think one little think on a human basis? There's ten of that gang in there, and they're pizen with whisky and desire for murder. They'll drink you up like a bottle of booze <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> half-way <b>to</b> the door. Be intelligent, now, and use at least wild-hog sense. Sit down and wait till we have some chance <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out without being carried in baskets.' ...|$|R
6000|$|AUNT MARY. Californians always telegraph, my dear; {{they never}} think of writing. It isn't {{expensive}} enough, and it doesn't make your blood run cold {{enough to get a}} letter, and so they send you one of those miserable yellow despatches whenever they can--those printed in a long string, if possible, so that you'll be sure to die <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the end of it. I suppose your brother has fallen into all those ways, and says [...] "reckon" [...] and [...] "ornary" [...] and [...] "which the same," [...] just like one of Mr. Bret Harte's characters.|$|E
6000|$|... "By the way," [...] {{the colonel}} said, {{when they took}} their leave, [...] "remember, the word for the night is, `Newcastle.' You will {{probably}} be challenged several times by sentries <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> your waggons, for, {{although there is no}} absolute insurrection at present, there is no saying when the Boers may break out. They will hardly think of attacking a body of troops marching peaceably along; still, it is as well to neglect no precautions. If you are challenged, `Who comes there?' you will reply, `Friends.' The sentry will then say, `Advance and give the word.' You walk forward and say, `Newcastle,' and you will pass all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She never {{mentions}} her husband's name without saying, 'My husband, the Resident,' but for {{all that}} she is a kind hearted woman--a very kind hearted woman. I pulled a child of hers through who was down with fever at Bhurtpore; he had a very close shave of it, and she has never forgotten it. She greeted me when she came on board almost with tears in her eyes at the thought of that time. I told her I had a young lady under my charge, and she said that she would be very pleased to do anything she could for you. She is a stanch friend is Mrs. Resident, and you will find her useful <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the end of the voyage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Don't {{reopen the}} chasm, Doc,' I begs him. 'Any Yankeeness I may have is geographical; and, {{as far as}} I am concerned, a Southerner {{is as good as}} a Filipino any day. I'm feeling to bad too argue. Let's have secession without misrepresentation, if you say so; but what I need is more {{laudanum}} and less Lundy's Lane. If you're mixing that compound gefloxide of gefloxicum for me, please fill my ears with it <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> around <b>to</b> the battle of Gettysburg, for there is a subject full of talk.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{plan does}} not seem to me a very good one," [...] said Captain Fitzgerald thoughtfully. [...] "I can have no doubt that it has succeeded in time past, and may {{probably}} succeed again, but you cannot expect that the natives, even if disposed to be peaceful, will accept your message at once. It may take weeks, perhaps months, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> them <b>to</b> believe the gospel, so as to permit of my men going ashore unarmed, and in the meantime, while you are engaged in this effort, what am I to be doing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You do {{not know}} what you are saying, monsieur; it would be {{altogether}} impossible. People do not get taken on as lay sisters in the convent of Our Lady unless they are known; besides, in other ways it would be altogether impossible, and even if it were not it might be years <b>before</b> <b>you</b> could <b>get</b> <b>to</b> speak to the countess, for there are only two or three of us who ever enter the visitors' rooms; and lastly, if you were found out I don't know what would be done to both of us. No, that would never do at all." ...|$|R
60|$|Everybody who {{has moved}} {{about the world}} at all knows Ring's Come-one Come-all Up-to-date Stores. The main office is in New York. Broadway, to be exact, on the left as you go down, just <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Park Row, where the {{newspapers}} come from. There is another office in Chicago. Others in St. Louis, St. Paul, and across the seas in London, Paris, Berlin, and, in short, everywhere. The peculiar advantage about Ring's Stores {{is that you can}} get anything you happen to want there, from a motor to a macaroon, and rather cheaper than you could get it anywhere else. England had up to the present been ill-supplied with these handy paradises, the one in Piccadilly being the only extant specimen. But now Mr. Ring in person had crossed the Atlantic on a tour of inspection, and things were shortly to be so brisk that you would be able to hear them whizz.|$|E
60|$|The Tunnel is a {{subterranean}} passage {{under the}} Thames, {{made at a}} place where it was impossible to have a bridge, on account of the shipping. They expected, when they made the Tunnel, that it would be used a great deal by persons wishing to cross the river. But it is found, on trial, that almost every body who wishes to go across the river at that place prefers to go in a boat rather than go down into the Tunnel. The reason is, that the Tunnel is so far below the bed of the river that you have to go down a long series of flights of stairs <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the entrance to it; and then, after going across, you have to come up just as many stairs before you get into the street again. This is found to be so troublesome and fatiguing that almost every one who has occasion to go across the river prefers to cross it by a ferry boat {{on the surface of the}} water; and scarcely any one goes into the Tunnel except those who wish to visit it out of curiosity.|$|E
6000|$|Our friend laughed harshly, and we {{were glad}} to see him {{restored}} to so much cheerfulness, at any rate. [...] "I think the notion is a pretty good fit, though if you don't like to wear it I don't insist. Why should you object to being likened to those poor fellows who come last on the programme at the vaudeville? Very often they are as good as the others, and sometimes, when I have determined to get my five hours' enjoyment to the last moment before six o'clock, I have had my reward in something unexpectedly delightful {{in the work of the}} Chasers. I have got into close human relations with them, I and the half-dozen brave spirits who have stuck it out with me, while the ushers went impatiently about, clacking the seats back, and picking up the programmes and lost articles under them. I have had the same sense of kindly comradery with you, and now and then my patience has been rewarded by you, just as it has been by the Chasers at the vaudeville, and I've said so to people. I've said: 'You're wrong to put down the magazine the way most of you do <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> those departments at the end. Sometimes there are quite good things in them.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--but the {{law would}} be all in her favour <b>before</b> <b>you</b> could <b>get</b> it <b>to</b> assist you,--even if <b>you</b> could <b>get</b> its assistance. In her {{peculiar}} position, it is rational that she should choose to wait till she be able to act for herself. Very great interests will be at her disposal, and she will of course wish to be near those who can advise her." ...|$|R
5000|$|Prior {{to being}} cast in Breaking Bad, Dean Norris {{had a history}} of being typecast as law {{enforcement}} and military type characters. Norris reasons [...] "I guess you have a certain look, it's kind of an authoritative law enforcement-type look, and that look is certainly the first thing that people cast <b>you</b> with <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a chance <b>to</b> do some acting." [...] Vince Gilligan had talked to an actual DEA agent about creating Hank's character.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not quite;--where you see {{the light}} at the end the road turns to the right, and the house is just <b>before</b> <b>you.</b> There are great iron gates, and terraces, and wondrous {{paraphernalia}} <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> up <b>to</b> the door. I can tell you Monkhams is quite a wonder. I have to shut myself up every Wednesday morning, and hand the house over to Mrs. Crutch, the housekeeper, who comes out in a miraculous brown silk gown, to shew it to visitors. On other days, you'll find Mrs. Crutch quite civil and useful;--but on Wednesdays, she is majestic. Charles always goes off among his sheep on that day, and I shut myself up with a pile of books in a little room. You will have to be imprisoned with me. I do so long to peep at the visitors." ...|$|R
