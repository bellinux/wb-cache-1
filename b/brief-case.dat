5000|$|Operation Mincemeat {{involved}} the acquisition and dressing up {{of a human}} cadaver as a [...] "Major William Martin, R.M." [...] and putting it into the sea near Huelva, Spain. Attached to the dead body was a <b>brief-case</b> containing fake letters falsely stating that the Allied attack would be against Sardinia and Greece rather than Sicily, the actual point of invasion. When the body was found, with all the false pocket litter data, the Spanish Intelligence Service passed copies of the papers to the German Intelligence Service which passed them on to their High Command. The ruse was so successful that the Germans still believed that Sardinia and Greece were the intended objectives, weeks after the landings in Sicily had begun.|$|E
50|$|In 1978 a {{combination}} lock {{which could be}} set by the user to a sequence of his own choosing was invented by Andrew Elliot Rae. At this time the electronic keypad was invented and {{he was unable to}} get any manufacturers to back his mechanical lock for lockers, luggage, or <b>brief-cases.</b> The silicon chip locks never became popular due to the need for battery power to maintain their integrity. The patent expired and the original mechanical invention was instantly manufactured and sold worldwide mainly for luggage, lockers, and hotel safes. It is now a standard part of the luggage used by travellers.|$|R
50|$|During {{his spare}} time Sushen Mukherjee - {{the time when he}} used to be free from his main freedom {{fighting}} activities which he held as his real pre-occupation - used to earn resources from door to door selling of quality tea, uncommon fancy materials and antiques etc. among the nobles, well-wishers and 'well to do' members of society. Or else, he would travel to Bombay, Madras to find avenues of earning revenue for the establishment he so fondly founded in Amar Kutir. Thus he came across different shades of people. Bottom line being, that was how he learned the tricks and trades of waxing, cracking and printing, hitherto popularly known as Batik Print on fancy leather goods such as ladies' handbags, purses, <b>brief-cases,</b> side bags etc. He was the pioneer in this type of artifices trading and which, of course, he mastered through intermingling with traders visiting India from Malayasia, Indonesia in the late thirties and early forties. This itself is a history. During his years in prison Mukherjee met several revolutionary leaders, notably Moni Ganguly and Panna Lal Dasgupta. The prisons of British authorities were at that time hot beds of Marxist discussion and training. From 1938 when the British government relaxed its rules and started releasing many of the revolutionaries from prison, they started living and working in Amar Kutir.They were instrumental in organizing night classes and spreading Marxist ideas amongst the rural masses. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, many of the revolutionaries left Amar Kutir and were directly involved in organizing peasant movement in the villages. Many of them were active during the Quit India movement in 1942. Tarapada and Jata Majhi of Rupur Samaya Sadan died in police firing in a raid on Bolpur Railway Station conducted by thousands of people assembled by Amar Kutir.|$|R
50|$|During another police encounter, Babu {{is again}} wounded but becomes insane this time, also {{becoming}} amnesiac. D.I.G. Mogan (Major Sundarrajan), the local inspector then comes across Anand, and {{after seeing the}} striking resemblance between him and Babu, advices him to act as Babu {{in order to get}} all the secrets of the gang and have them arrested. Anand agrees, but later realises Babu is his brother. Anand's girlfriend Jaya (Jayalalithaa) sees him having lot of money in a <b>brief-case,</b> and the police chase him. Unaware of the truth, she thinks he has turned into a criminal, and refuses to speak to him. Anand's mother also comes to know of this, and becomes heartbroken. However, Mangalam and Jaya soon reconcile with Anand after learning of the truth, and they both also learn that Babu is his brother.|$|E

She got her first TV show job by {{appearing}} in Ned and Stacey and her first national commercial, Clear blue easy, {{playing the role of}} Clear blue expert Claire, and was directed by David Lynch. It wasn't too long before she found herself working regularly on a number of shows including appearances in Rescue 77, The Pretender, The Young & the Restless, According to Jim, Reno 911!, Las Vegas, Scrubs, and Rules of Engagement. She {{was one of the most}} recognized <b>brief-case</b> beauties for 4 seasons as a model on Deal or no Deal holding case #18.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} “anti-politics” {{is a useful}} tool to {{understand}} the broad coalitions that mobilized in pursuit of better health and hygiene in Wilhelmine Germany. In an attempt to complement bio-political analysis that focuses on knowledge production and governmentality, and other studies that focus on institutional and party-political conflict, this article shows how members of the German natural healing movement used “anti-politics” to produce consensus across party-political, class and confessional differences. Using two <b>brief-case</b> studies taken from the German natural healing movement, my work suggests that anti-politics created a space where fluid but durable coalitions formed {{in pursuit of the}} shared goal of better health and hygiene for the people. In part because these coalitions were regularly dissolved and reformed, historians have spent less time analyzing these spaces of consensus than they have on other aspects of popular health and hygiene movements. This article shows how focusing more attention on the anti-politics of health can illuminate spaces of shared values that transcended party-political, class and confessional differences...|$|E
40|$|The {{man with}} the <b>brief-case</b> I once met {{a man with a}} brief case on a train …. I forget between where and where. If you have {{travelled}} by train in India you may have met him too. He is conscious of cultural difference and wishes you to understand that Indians have family values- on account of which they don't go in for divorce or extra-marital sex. It was possibly he who first told me (though I have read it somewhere since) that actuarial calculations reveal that one in three marriages in Britain, and one in two in the United States, is destined to end in divorce. I find his contrast confirmed in a scholarly study of the subject. By comparison with its 'alarming rate ' in the West, 'divorce was unknown to the Hindu institution of marriage. Husband and wife were bound to each other not only in this life, but even in lives to follow ' (Pothen 1986 :ix). But though contemporary Englishmen may well seem faithless by Smartha Brahman standards, it was not ever thus. Except by act of Parliament, legal divorce with the right to remarry was not an option before 1857; and up to that date the largest number of Parliamentary petitions in any one year was twelve (Stone 1990 : 325). Admittedly, this very low figure may have owed as much to cost as to widespread marital contentment. And admittedly, the less affluent too...|$|E
40|$|Maktivists {{are social}} makers—people who make things for social change. Maktivism brings {{together}} {{the technology and}} media-technology activists as discussed by Milberry (chapter 2, this volume) and Dunbar-Hester (chap-ter 4, this volume); content-activists, as discussed by Jenkins (chapter 3,this volume), Chidgey (chapter 6, this volume), and Burwell and Boler (chapter 7, this volume); policy-activists, as discussed by McPhail et al (chapter 5, this volume); and artists as discussed by Reilly (chapter 8, this volume). As such, Maktivism is not just making things that change/preserve/save the world/planet. A Maktivist is a maker who is authentic—not a poseur (Bricmont and Sokol 1998) or someone just following a trend or doing it for money, to get tenure, or to be popular. A Maktivist has {{a high degree of}} personal involvement and commitment in the existemological (existential epistemology, i. e., “Learn-by-Being ” [Mann 2006]) sense. DIY maktivism was introduced in Toronto in 1998 by way of two courses: ECE 1766 and ECE 385 —making material things and hacking GNU Linux device drivers to make those material things work in an Open Source cloud-computing mobile/portable/smartphone environment. The emphasis was on “tin-quiry ” (tinkering as inquiry) and spontaneous participatory “hacks ” using found objects, in contrast to the more “professionalized, ” organized, and carefully planned approach to engineering that other professors usually teach. In this framework, examples I used to teach “tinquiry ” included a chair which had spikes that only retracted when a credit card was inserted in order to download a “License to Sit ” (Mann 2001 c); and Griefcase, a <b>brief-case</b> equipped with a fingerprint-scanner briefcase that can be opened by anyone other than its owner. Both these projects taught DIY “hack-ing ” principles—each student obtained a surplus card reader and finger-print scanner, and was taught how to reverse engineer these products and write GNU Linux device drivers for them. Griefcase(TM) was designed fo...|$|E
