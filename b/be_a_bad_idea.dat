500|$|The PTC {{called on}} the United States Department of Justice and the Judiciary Committees of both houses of Congress to {{investigate}} whether MTV violated child pornography laws in casting teenaged actors in Skins, a remake of the British TV series of the same name. MTV rated Skins [...] "TV-MA", meaning the show is not suitable for audiences under 17. The Los Angeles Times responded in an editorial: [...] "...looking for government remedies is ineffective and unwise; we suspect the network's editors are smart enough to skirt prosecution.

500|$|At {{the start}} of the Russo-Japanese War, Fuji, {{commanded}} by Captain Matsumoto Kazu, was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet.

Tōgō had expected his surprise night attack on the Russians by his destroyers to be much more successful than it actually was and expected to find them badly disorganized and weakened, but the Russians had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack.

500|$|The {{sessions}} were particularly difficult for DeLonge, who suffered chronic back pain. [...] "When your back is killing {{you and you}} have to have surgery and all this stuff, it's just kind of hard to keep a focus on the happier times in your life," [...] he told MTV News. [...] "You end up writing all these songs about feeling sad and confused." [...] He often could only stand and sing for five minutes at a time before having to lay down again. Journalist Joe Shooman writes that the album followed a DIY spirit, rather than spending [...] "months and months refining and polishing everything for a major label and international pop market." [...] DeLonge intended to pay for the project himself, but when an A representative heard four unfinished songs, MCA—the record label Blink-182 was on—wanted to finance the album. DeLonge's manager convinced him it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea</b> to pass up someone else paying for its distribution. According to Boukas, an MCA representative dropped in on the sessions and was pleased with what he heard.

2500|$|A similar {{piece of}} {{evidence}} is found in Act 5, Scene 1. After Warwick and his troops have entered Coventry and are awaiting the arrival of Oxford, Somerset, Montague and Clarence, Richard urges Edward to storm the city and attack Warwick immediately. In True Tragedy, Edward refuses, arguing [...] "No, some other may set upon our backs/We'll stay till all be entered and then follow them" [...] (ll.2742–2743). In 3 Henry VI however, Edward says, [...] "So other foes may set upon our backs./Stand we in good array: for they no doubt/Will issue out again, and bid us battle" [...] (ll.61–63). The {{difference between the two}} passages is that in True Tragedy, Edward knows more regiments are coming ("we'll stay till be all be entered"), but {{in the context of the}} play, he has no way of knowing this, he should be unaware that Oxford, Somerset, Montague and Clarence are heading to Coventry. In 3 Henry VI however, he merely feels that attacking would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea</b> as it would leave their rear defenceless ("so other foes may set upon our backs"). This suggests that in True Tragedy, the reporter was thinking ahead, anticipating the arrival of the others and anachronistically having a character aware of their inevitable arrival. Again, as with the omission of important information, this illogical foreknowledge of events is the type of mistake which characterises the bad quartos in general.|$|E
2500|$|After more arguing {{between the}} senior officers, they agreed on 27 August that Khánh, Minh, and Khiêm would rule as a triumvirate for two months, {{until a new}} {{civilian}} government could be formed. The trio then brought paratroopers into Saigon to end the rioting. However, the momentum petered out {{due to the lack}} of unity in the ruling triumvirate. Khánh dominated the decision-making, sidelining Khiêm and Minh. Khánh blamed Khiêm for organizing a failed coup attempt led by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức on 13 September. General Cao, a Catholic and former Diệm loyalist, claimed in a 1972 newspaper interview that Khiêm, by then prime minister, had asked him to join the coup.

Khiêm's lack of public action was seen as tacit support for the coup; A U.S. Embassy log during the coup claimed that the Thiệu and Khiêm [...] "seem so passive that they appear to have been either tacitly supporting or associated with his move by Đức and Phát", and that Khiêm had [...] "issued expressions of firm support for Khánh somewhat belatedly", as control was eventually reestablished.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning {{from his}} {{assumption}} of the cardinal's hat in 1530, Cardinal de Tournon {{had been in a}} position to see and to disapprove of some of the doings at the royal court and elsewhere among the aristocracy. [...] Calvinism and Lutheranism had been making inroads among the aristocracy, and in particular with King Francis' only sister Marguerite de Navarre. Around 1535 she had become sufficiently emboldened that she requested the King for permission to invite Philipp Melanchthon, Luther's closest associate, to Court. [...] She wished to have him discuss his theology and debate with orthodox Christians. [...] Tournon felt compelled to intervene, however dangerous the prospect might be, and he delicately persuaded the King that showing any favor or even lenience toward Protestants would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea.</b> [...] The most famous of these confrontations, however, came {{at the end of the}} Cardinal's life. From 9 September 1561 to 9 October 1561 Cardinal François de Tournon was one of six cardinals, including the Papal Legate Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, who attended the Colloquy of Poissy, which had been summoned by Queen Mother Catherine de' Medici and her Chancellor Michel de l'Hôpital in an attempt to bring about a reconciliation between Catholics and Calvinists (Huguenots) in France. [...] At the First Session, however, when Theodore Beza, John Calvin's French disciple, was explaining the Calvinist view of the Eucharist, Cardinal de Tournon could not contain himself and launched into a denunciation of Beza's heresies.|$|E
