A good or poor harvest of Bombay-	 duck exercise direct influence upon the livelihood of men and women engaged in 	 this labour intensive sector in the maritime states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. It is 	 an important fish for domestic use and also a valuable export item in dried or 	 laminated form. Fresh extracts from <b>Bombay-duck</b> is believed to have considerable 	 medicinal properties. The fishery is supported by a single species, Harpadon 	 nehereus, popularly known as <b>Bombay-duck</b> in English.

It is supported by a single species Harpodon neherpua (Hamilton). It has a wide and discontinuous distribution along to the coasts of East Africa, Indian subcontinent, Malaya, Indonesia and China. In India it is taken in large quantities on the south and south east coasts of Saurashtra on the Gujarat coast and the Konkan coast of Maharashtra. It is also taken in appreciable quantities on the Andhra-Orissa coast and from the estuaries of Bengal. With the introduction of a programme of mechanisation of the fishing craft under the Five Year Plans, the fishing activity and the area of exploitation along the Maharashtra and Gujarat coasts have considerably increased, resulting in larger landings of <b>Bombay-duck.</b> The fishery today has attained the status of one of the major fisheries of India...|$|E

Due to incessant rise in prices of Hilsa, catfish, major and minor carps in the recent past, fish loving Bengalis relied on marine fishes such as mackerel, sciaenids, seabass, <b>Bombay-duck</b> and flatfishes for their consumption. The marine fishes were less preferred by Bengali fish eating population earlier because of their colour and smell...|$|E

However, no attempt {{has so far been}} made to develop bibliographies on commercially important species/groups of marine fishes of India, so that the large community of research workers and fishery managers could be benefited. Therefore, to begin with, the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute has taken up a programme of compilation of 'Annotated Bibliographies' on commercially important species/groups such as prawns, oil sardine, mackerel, silver-bellies, ribbon-fishes and <b>bombay-duck...</b>|$|E
