Around 1636, Descartes and Fermat founded analytic geometry by equating solutions to an equation of two variables with points on a plane curve. In 1804, to achieve geometric solutions without using coordinates, Bolzano introduced certain operations on points, lines and planes, which are predecessors of vectors. His work was then used in the conception of <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinates</b> by Möbius in 1827. In 1828 C. V. Mourey suggested {{the existence of an}} algebra surpassing not only ordinary algebra but also two-dimensional algebra created by him searching a geometrical interpretation of complex numbers.|$|E

Based on a generalized <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinate</b> representation, our work generalizes the DILOC algorithm to the localization problem under arbitrary deployments of sensor nodes and anchor nodes. First, a criterion and algorithm are developed to determine a generalized <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinate</b> of a node with respect to its neighboring nodes, which do not require the node to be inside the convex hull of its neighbors. Next, for the localization problem based on the generalized <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinate</b> representation, a necessary and sufficient condition for the localizability of a sensor network with a generic configuration is obtained. Finally, a new linear iterative algorithm is proposed to ensure distributed implementation as well as global convergence to the true coordinates. © 2014 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{content-based}} blind watermarking algorithm which is robust to arbitrary affine transformation attacks. Although watermarking technology has improved remarkably nowadays, algorithm that resistant to geometric transformation attacks {{remains to be}} a challenge to the researchers. A small distortion of the watermarked image may lead the failure of many existing watermark detecting and extracting algorithms because of the destruction of synchronization. We present a synchronization method based on the <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinate</b> representation of the host image. We first segment the host image according to the pixel values, then calculate the weighted center (of mass) of each part, and then select three of these centers to establish a <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinate</b> system. The host image is represented using this <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinate</b> system. A squared area is chosen and is decomposed using 3 -level discrete biorthogonal wavelet transform. The watermark is embedded in the middle bands of the wavelet decomposition of the represented host image using a CDMA based algorithm. The watermarked image is obtained by inverse wavelet transform and inverse <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinate</b> transform. In the watermark extraction phase, the same segmentation should be done on the received image, and the received image should be represented using the <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinate</b> system, and a corresponding squared area is chosen and decomposed using the same biorthogonal wavelet transform as used in the watermark embedding phase, and then the watermark is extracted from the middle bands using the CDMA based algorithm. The proposed algorithm is absolutely blind. Multi-bit information can be embedded in the host image. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is robust to arbitrary affine transformation attacks and many other attacks...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{determining}} the sensor locations in a large sensor network using relative distance (range) measurements only. Our work follows from a seminal paper by Khan et al. [1] where a distributed algorithm, known as DILOC, for sensor localization is given using the <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinate.</b> A main limitation of the DILOC algorithm is that all sensor nodes must be inside the convex hull of the anchor nodes. In this paper, we consider a general sensor network without the convex hull assumption, which incurs challenges in determining the sign pattern of the <b>barycentric</b> <b>coordinate.</b> A criterion is developed {{to address this issue}} based on available distance measurements. Also, a new distributed algorithm is proposed to guarantee the asymptotic localization of all localizable sensor nodes...|$|R
