5000|$|The {{psychologist}} Cyril Burt {{is known}} for his studies on the effect of heredity on intelligence. Shortly after he died, his studies of inheritance and intelligence came into disrepute after evidence emerged indicating he had falsified research data. Tucker's paper (1994) is illuminative on both how [...] "critical reading" [...] was performed in the discovery of the falsified data as well as in many famous psychologists [...] "non-critical reading" [...] of Burt's papers. Tucker shows that the recognized experts within the field of intelligence research <b>blindly</b> <b>accepted</b> Cyril Burt's research even though it was without scientific value and probably directly faked: They wanted to believe that IQ is hereditary and considered uncritically empirical claims supporting this view. This paper thus demonstrates how critical reading (and the opposite) may be related to beliefs as well as to interests and power structures.|$|E

Generally, however, they are in comparatively unessential things and were caused by trusting to a usually reliable memory.

5000|$|Different [...] "movements", [...] "paradigms", [...] "positions" [...] or [...] "schools" [...] {{in a given}} field tend to have {{different}} cognitive authorities. [...] "Most people, even most academics, {{do not have the}} time, training, or occasion to work through the technical literature on a controversial topic, and so, they must rely on professionals for a disinterested evaluation" [...] (Herrnstein, 1973, pp. 52,53; quoted from Tucker, 1994). Tucker shows, however, that the recognized experts within the field of intelligence research <b>blindly</b> <b>accepted</b> Cyril Burt's research even though it was without scientific value and probably directly faked: They wanted to believe that IQ was hereditary, and considered uncritically empirical claims supporting this view. When a researcher from another field (Leon Kamin) first demonstrated that Burt's results were wrong, he was not considered a cognitive authority. When his criticism was considered unavoidable, the established researchers tried to change history and deprive Kamin of his intellectual credit. This example shows something about how cognitive authority may be ascribed in the real world. [...] The concept of cognitive authority also raises the question of the role of experts. On the one hand, it is dangerous to blindly believe claims originating from [...] "experts" [...] while on the other hand, [...] "commonsensism" [...] is also a problematic epistemology. John Dewey (1920) discussed this dilemma and worked on improving general education {{in order to make the}} general public less vulnerable to the power of experts.|$|E
50|$|The 1919 Treaty of Versailles {{with its}} heavy reparations stirred up resentment among Germans, and {{sometimes}} even vengeful feeling. When the neediness arose from {{a general lack of}} work, all Adolf Hitler needed to do was to blow on the embers. In Imperial Germany, people had been drawn into blind nationalism. It had been then believed that anyone who made nationalistic speeches was a noble person. It is therefore little wonder that Hitler found so many followers throughout Weimar Germany, even in Löllbach and other nearby villages. His promises were believed, and his intentions and laws, right up to the Enabling Act and the Third Reich’s racist decrees, were <b>blindly</b> <b>accepted,</b> and the Weimar Republic, which had never had an effective democracy, was swept aside. In 1932, the Meisenheim district, in which Löllbach lay, was dissolved and merged into the Kreuznach district. The German people developed productive values under Hitler, who all the while was preparing the country for war. Country folk, too, did their share of this work as part of the Nazi Erzeugungsschlacht (“Battle for Production”) policy, increasing agricultural production while never realizing the direction in which Hitler was taking them. In 1939, the Second World War broke out. It claimed more victims than the First World War, among Löllbach’s men as well. Once again, men from every age group, from tenderest youth to older men who headed households, had to give their lives.|$|E
5000|$|When Salonen {{arrived in}} Los Angeles, he still liked to {{consider}} himself a composer-conductor, {{but the truth}} was that he had stopped writing music. [...] "The obvious and easy explanation for me to give to people when they were asking why there hadn't been any new pieces for a while was that I had been conducting so much, I had no time," [...] he said. [...] "But that was only half the explanation."As a European Modernist, Salonen said, he had been inculcated with negatives, such as to avoid melody, harmonic identity and rhythmic pulse. Secretly, though, he was attracted to John Adams, who was then dismissed overseas as being simplistic. [...] "Only {{after a couple of years}} here did I begin to see that the European canon I <b>blindly</b> <b>accepted</b> was not the only truth," [...] he said. [...] "Over here, I was able to think about this rule that forbids melody. It's madness. Madness!"Without a European musical elite looking over his shoulder, Salonen began to feel that it was fine to have his own ideas. [...] "My focus moved from an ideological principle to a pleasure principle" [...] is how he described the composition of his breakthrough piece, [...] "LA Variations," [...] which the Philharmonic premiered in 1997.Although a work of great intricacy and virtuosity that doesn't ignore Salonen's Modernist training, [...] "LA Variations" [...] builds on rhythmic innovations closer to Adams. The piece proved an immediate hit, so much so that Salonen was stunned by the reaction and then by the score's continuing success - it has been taken up by several other conductors and had more than 80 performances worldwide.|$|E

50|$|The DIT uses a Likert-type {{scale to}} give {{quantitative}} ratings and rankings to issues surrounding five different moral dilemmas, or stories. Specifically, respondents rate 12 issues {{in terms of}} their importance to the corresponding dilemma and then rank the four most important issues. The issue statements that respondents respond to are not fully developed stances which fall on one side or another of the presented dilemma. Rather, they are conceptualized as fragments of reasoning, to which respondents must project meaning. Meaning is projected by means of moral reasoning schemas (each of which is explained below). A schema is a mental representation of stimuli that has previously been encountered, which allows one to make sense of newly experienced, but related, stimuli. So, when a respondent reads an issue statement that both makes sense to them, as well as triggers a preferred schema, that statement is given a high rating and ranking. Conversely, when a respondent reads an issue statement that is either construed as nonsensical or overly simplistic, the item receives a low rating. Patterns of ratings and rankings reveal information about three specific schemas of moral reasoning: the Personal Interests Schema, the Maintaining Norms Schema and the Postconventional Schema. The Personal Interests Schema is regarded as the least developmentally advanced level of moral reasoning. In operating primarily at the Personal Interests level, the respondent takes into consideration what the protagonist of the story, or those close to the protagonist, has to gain or lose. The Maintaining Norms Schema is considered more advanced than the Personal Interests Schema, as it emphasizes more than the individual. At the Maintaining Norms reasoning level, law and authority are important, as each of these helps to uphold social order, which is paramount to this schema. So, a respondent who is predominantly using this schema will take into consideration {{what needs to be done}} in order to be compliant with the social order of society. Finally, the Postconventional Schema is regarded as the most developmentally advanced. At the Postconventional reasoning level, laws are not simply <b>blindly</b> <b>accepted</b> (as with the Maintaining Norms Schema), but are scrutinized in order to ensure society-wide benefit. So, a respondent who is primarily using this schema will focus on what is best for society as a whole. For example, the Civil Rights movement was a product of Postconventional reasoning, as followers were most concerned with the society-wide effects of (in)equality. It should be noted that, though an individual may rely more heavily on one of the aforementioned schemas, moral reasoning is typically informed, to varying degrees, by each of the schemas.|$|E
5000|$|Noël Coward: [...] "He {{died young}} enough to be called ‘brilliant’, and not {{decrepit}} enough to be called ‘great’, which is sad, because he would have enjoyed hugely that particular form of eminence, and I feel that he would have given his wreath of laurels a slightly rakish tilt, however old he was." [...] Ernest Hemingway:"In the old days, when your correspondent was a working newspaper man, he had a friend named Bill Ryall, then a European correspondent for the Manchester Guardian. This Ryall had a white, lantern-jawed face of the sort that is supposed to haunt you if seen suddenly in a London fog, but on a bright windy day in Paris meeting him on the boulevard wearing a long fur-collared great coat he had the never-far-from-tragic look of a ham Shakespearean actor. None of us thought of him as a genius then and I do not think he thought of himself as one either, being too busy, too intelligent, and, then, too sardonic to go in for being a genius in a city where they were a nickel a dozen and it was much more distinguished to be hard working. He was a South African and had been very badly blown up in the war while commanding infantry. Afterwards he had gotten into the intelligence service and {{at the time of the}} peace conference he had been a sort of pay-off man for the disbursing of certain sums spent by the British to subsidize and influence certain individuals and certain organs of the French press. He talked very frankly about this and as I was a kid then he told me many things that were the beginning of whatever education I received in international politics. Later Ryall wrote under the name of William Bolitho, went to New York, became a genius, and worked at it until he died. You may have read his Murder For Profit, his Twelve Against The Gods, or some of the pieces he wrote in the old N.Y. World. I never saw him after he became Bolitho, but when he was Ryall he was a wonderful guy. He may have been even finer when he was Bolitho but I do not see how it would be possible. I think sometimes being a genius in that hick town must have bored him very much. But I never saw him to ask him.” Walter Lippmann:“For Bolitho was a radiant person. In his company ordinary things were transfigured, acquiring the glamour of mystery and great import. His talk had a quality which belonged to one who dwelt familiarly, so it seemed, with the hidden elements of man’s life and with the infinite permutations of his affairs. In his presence it was easy to believe that one had a private revelation of those great concerns which in prosaic living seem verbal and remote; with him one walked quickly through portals, that are usually closed, into the statelier mansions of the soul. He was an eager guide. Whoever happened to be there, he took with him in his explorations, not pausing to ask whether his companion had the wit or the courage for such adventures. He was lavish in his talk."Walter Duranty:"Of all the people I have met in the last twenty years, and there have been some high-sounding names amongst them, I think Bolitho had the finest intellect. Under forty when he died, he had already made his name as a forceful and original writer, but his mental range wait far beyond the limits of literature. He possessed to a remarkable degree the same quality which proved the key to Lenin's success, namely, the gift of making a quick and accurate summary of facts and drawing therefrom the right, logical and inevitable conclusions[...] [...] [...] Unlike most people, he never <b>blindly</b> <b>accepted</b> the opinion of others, but always thought things out for himself, and never ceased to impress on me the necessity of doing that at all times." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper tackles {{the issue}} of {{educational}} development from a somewhat different, and still under-explored, perspective: that of human resource management (HRM). This paper argues that small territories have, often <b>blindly,</b> <b>accepted</b> an &# 39;industrial relations&# 39; (IR) framework that is much more {{at home in the}} formalistic, mass production and mass employment based, manufacturing economies of the industrialised world. While the future of &# 39;IR&# 39; in these settings is also being called into question today, small territories have been hard put all along to apply their labour relations practice to the strictures of this theory. An inductive analysis of the human resource condition in small territories reveals rather a contextual disposition for empowerment and entrepreneurship - a critical component for successful HRM practice - which is often unacknowledged, let alone addressed in public policy. The paper identifies aspects of current industrial relations as well as educational practice that could be addressed in order to better tap the benefits of this different understanding of human resourcefulness.
