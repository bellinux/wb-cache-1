5|$|Subsequent to its {{discovery}} at the Mikea Forest, Petter's big-footed mouse {{was also}} found as a subfossil in cave deposits at Andrahomana in far southeastern Madagascar, a find reported in 2006. There, it was found together with more abundant remains of the introduced <b>black</b> <b>rat</b> and house mouse (Mus musculus), as well as indigenous rodents such as the bastard big-footed mouse. Two Petter's big-footed mouse bones were radiocarbon dated to 790–410BCE and 150–390CE, respectively, a period when the local climate became drier and humans first appeared. Macrotarsomys species are thought to burrow in sandy ground {{and would not be}} expected to enter caves; therefore, the subfossils are probably remains of animals eaten by birds of prey. Although Petter's big-footed mouse could conceivably persist in remnant pockets of wet habitat in southeastern Madagascar, searches at two sites near Andrahomana failed to confirm its presence. It may have become locally extinct in the area because of the drying climate and competition with the <b>black</b> <b>rat.</b>|$|E

5|$|The unique {{habitat of}} Lac Alaotra is {{threatened}} by pollution, destruction of marshes {{for the construction of}} rice fields, overfishing, and introduced species such as exotic fish, plants, the <b>black</b> <b>rat</b> (Rattus rattus), and the small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), another small carnivoran. A bird restricted to the area, the Alaotra grebe (Tachybaptus rufolavatus), was declared extinct in 2010 and the population of the bamboo lemur fell by about 30% from 1994 to 1999. As a narrowly distributed species with a small population, S.durrelli is likely to be threatened by degradation of its habitat and perhaps competition with the small Indian civet and the <b>black</b> <b>rat,</b> but its conservation status has not yet been formally assessed. The DWCT is working to conserve the Lac Alaotra area and the region has been designated as a protected area.|$|E

5|$|Noronhomys vespuccii was {{a fairly}} large rodent, larger than the <b>black</b> <b>rat</b> (Rattus rattus). A {{member of the family}} Cricetidae and {{subfamily}} Sigmodontinae, it shares several distinctive characters with Holochilus and related genera within the tribe Oryzomyini, including high-crowned molars with simplified crown features and the presence of several ridges on the skull which help anchor the chewing muscles. Although a suite of traits suggest that Holochilus is its closest relative, it is distinctive in many ways and is therefore classified in a separate genus, Noronhomys. Its close relatives, including Holochilus and Lundomys, are adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle, spending much of their time in the water, but features of the Noronhomys bones suggest that it lost its semiaquatic lifestyle after arrival at its remote island.|$|E
5|$|The Noronha skink {{probably}} lacked predators before Fernando de Noronha {{was discovered}} by humans, but several species that arrived since do prey on it, most commonly the cat (Felis catus) and cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis). These may negatively affect skink abundance at some localities on the island. The Argentine black and white tegu lizard, Tupinambis merianae, and three introduced rodents, the house mouse (Mus musculus), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and <b>black</b> <b>rat</b> (Rattus rattus), have also been observed to eat Noronha skinks, but the rodents, particularly the house mouse, may have been scavenging on already dead skinks.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{factor in}} nesting mortality is starvation. Sibling rivalry can be intense, and in South Africa {{third and fourth}} chicks inevitably starve. In the dryer habitats with fewer amphibians the diet may lack sufficient vertebrate content and may cause bone abnormalities in growing chicks due to calcium deficiency. In Barbados, nests were sometimes raided by vervet monkeys, and a study in Florida reported the fish crow and <b>black</b> <b>rat</b> as other possible nest raiders. The same study attributed some nestling mortality to brown pelicans nesting in the vicinity, which accidentally, but frequently, dislodged nests or caused nestlings to fall. In Australia, Torresian crows, wedge-tailed eagles and white-bellied sea eagles take eggs or young, and tick infestation and viral infections may also be causes of mortality.|$|E

Some snake species may prey on the least weasel, including the <b>black</b> <b>rat</b> snake and copperhead. Aside from its smaller size, the least weasel is more vulnerable to predation than the stoat because it lacks a black predator deflection mark on the tail.|$|E
5|$|The swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) {{feeds on}} the fallen fruit of P.lanceolata and disperses the seed through its scat (dung). A field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that 88% of {{seeds in the}} scat were still viable {{although}} dormant. The red-necked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) feeds on drupes and is a likely seed dispersal agent. Animals can convey seed {{for one or two}} kilometres from where they have fed. Rodents such as the bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) and <b>black</b> <b>rat</b> (Rattus rattus) eat the drupes but chew the seed so that only fragments leave their digestive system. Foxes have been reported to eat the fruit, and kangaroos and large birds such as currawongs are thought to as well.|$|E
5|$|Curator of Birds Gary R. Graves of the Smithsonian Institution spent 18 years {{scouring}} {{the island for}} evidence of the taxon without success.

Graves points out that {{there is little evidence that}} habitat loss has played a role. It is noted that this swallow is not affected by being near human disturbance. Graves also added that the swallows adapted to nesting in man-made structures. In general, this swallow is not affected by being near human disturbance. It is proposed that nest boxes be used to counter habitat loss and predation.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to model the renal leptospiral load in 50 naturally infected <b>black</b> <b>rats</b> as a function of sex, age, and weight. Statistical analysis by sex showed that, in naturally infected males, the renal leptospiral load was correlated with weight (p-value = 0. 032). Moreover, our model showed that weight and sex were significant explanatory variables for the renal leptospiral load in naturally infected young <b>black</b> <b>rats</b> (R 2 = 0. 953). Laboratory experimentation could not replicate naturally acquired infection, but field studies also present many limitations. Our study is the first attempt to explain individual variations in the renal leptospiral load in naturally infected reservoir animals but further research is needed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

5|$|Fleas {{arose in}} the early Cretaceous, most likely as ectoparasites of mammals, {{before moving on to}} other groups {{including}} birds. Each species of flea is more or less a specialist on its host animal species: many species never breed on any other host, though some are less selective. Some families of fleas are exclusive to a single host group: for example, the Malacopsyllidae are found only on armadillos, the Ischnopsyllidae only on bats, and the Chimaeropsyllidae only on elephant shrews. The oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, is a vector of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium which causes bubonic plague. The disease was spread by rodents such as the <b>black</b> <b>rat,</b> which were bitten by fleas that then infected humans. Major outbreaks included the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death, both of which killed a sizeable fraction of the world's population.|$|E
5|$|Major nest predators include Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbirds (Cracticus spp.), {{laughing}} kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.) {{as well as}} introduced mammals such as the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), cat and <b>black</b> <b>rat</b> (Rattus rattus). Superb fairywrens may utilise a 'rodent-run' {{display to}} distract predators from nests with young birds. The head, neck and tail are lowered, wings held out and feathers fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call. A field study in Canberra found that superb fairywrens that lived in areas frequented by noisy miners (Manorina melanocephala) recognised miner alarm calls and took flight, and had learnt to ignore their non-alarm calls, while those that live in areas not frequented by noisy miners {{did not respond to}} miner alarm calls. This suggests the species has adapted and learned to discriminate and respond to another species' vocalisations.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys antillarum {{probably}} became extinct {{about the}} 1870s {{and is currently}} listed as such by the IUCN Red List. Its disappearance is usually attributed to the small Asian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus), which was introduced to Jamaica in 1872, and sometimes also to introduced Rattus species. Ray, on the other hand, argued that {{the significance of the}} mongoose had been overrated. Instead, he suggested that Oryzomys antillarum may have been affected by the massive environmental changes that occurred on the island after the British takeover in 1655. In that period, the bulk of the island came to be used for cultivation, so that the native habitat of Oryzomys was destroyed. Thus, Oryzomys was reduced to competition with introduced rats in man-made habitats, to which the latter are well adapted. Perhaps, Ray wrote, the <b>black</b> <b>rat</b> may {{not have been able to}} extirpate Oryzomys, but the brown rat, a later and more assertive invader, brought it to extinction. Cats and dogs preying on Oryzomys may also have contributed to its demise.|$|E
