25|$|Pseudohyperkalemia {{occurs when}} the {{measured}} potassium levels is falsely elevated. This condition is usually suspected when patient is clinically well without any ECG changes. Mechanical trauma during <b>blood</b> <b>drawing</b> can cause potassium leakage out of the red blood cells due to haemolysed blood sample. Since exercise can cause elevated potassium levels, repeated fist clenching can cause transient rise in potassium levels. Prolonged length of blood storage can also increase serum potassium levels. Hyperkalemia may only become apparent when a person's platelet concentration is more than 500,000/microL in a clotted blood sample (serum blood sample). Potassium leaks out of platelets after clotting has occurred. On the other hand, processing of heparinised, unclot blood does not cause falsely elevated potassium. In addition to that, high white cell count (greater than 120,000/microL) in patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia increases red blood cells fragility, thus causing pseudohyperkalemia during blood processing. This problem can be avoided by processing serum samples, because formation of clot protect the cells from haemolysis during processing. A familial form of pseudohyperkalemia may also be present, and is characterized by increased serum potassium in whole blood stored at or below room temperature, without additional hematological abnormalities. This is due to increased potassium permeability in red blood cells.|$|E

In a retrospective study, blood cultures from infants and children up to 18 years of age who had at least one positive blood culture during the year 2006 were analyzed for their volume of <b>blood</b> <b>drawn,</b> patient's weight, site of <b>blood</b> <b>draw</b> used, and <b>blood</b> culture results. Blood cultures were deemed adequate collections if they contained an appropriate weight-related volume of blood. Moreover, blood culture results were categorized as true pathogens, contaminants, and negative cultures; these were then compared and analyzed with respect to their volume and site of <b>blood</b> <b>draw.</b> A total of 5, 023 blood cultures were collected during 2006, of which 843 were analyzed. There were 306 (36 %) positive cultures among the 843 cultures analyzed. Of the 306 positive cultures, 98 (32 %) were contaminants and 208 (68 %) cultures grew significant pathogens. Thirty-five percent of the contaminant cultures had adequate volume compared to 60 % in the true bacteremia group (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Timely linkage to care by newly-diagnosed HIV+ {{individuals}} {{remains a}} significant challenge to achieving UNAIDS 90 - 90 - 90 goals. Current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend initiating anti-retroviral treatment (ART) regardless of CD 4 + count, with priority given {{to those with}} CD 4 + < 350 cells/μl. We evaluated the impact of not having a day-of-diagnosis CD 4 + count <b>blood</b> <b>draw,</b> as recommended by South African guidelines, on time to linkage, using data from a prospective cohort study. Individuals (N = 2773) were interviewed prior to HIV counseling and testing at three public sector primary care clinics in the greater Durban area; 785 were newly-diagnosed and eligible for the cohort study; 459 (58. 5 %) joined and were followed for eight months with three structured assessments. Linkage to care, defined as returning to clinic for CD 4 + count results, and day-of-diagnosis <b>blood</b> <b>draw</b> were self-reported. Overall, 72. 5 % {{did not have a}} day-of-diagnosis CD 4 + count <b>blood</b> <b>draw,</b> and 19. 2 % of these never returned. Compared with a day-of-diagnosis <b>blood</b> <b>draw,</b> the adjusted hazard ratio of linkage (AHRlinkage) associated with not having day-of-diagnosis <b>blood</b> <b>draw</b> was 0. 66 (95 %CI: 0. 51, 0. 85). By 4 months, 54. 8 % of those without day-of-diagnosis <b>blood</b> <b>draw</b> vs. 75. 2 % with one were linked to care (chi-squared p = 0. 004). Of those who deferred <b>blood</b> <b>draw,</b> 48. 3 % cited clinic-related and 51. 7 % cited personal reasons. AHRlinkage was 0. 60 (95 %CI: 0. 44, 0. 82) for clinic-related and 0. 53 (95 %CI: 0. 38, 0. 75) for personal reasons relative to having day-of-diagnosis <b>blood</b> <b>draw.</b> Newly-diagnosed HIV+ individuals who did not undergo CD 4 + count <b>blood</b> <b>draw</b> on the day they were diagnosed-regardless of the reason for deferring-had delayed linkage to care relative to those with same-day <b>blood</b> <b>draw.</b> To enhance prompt linkage to care even when test and treat protocols are implemented, all diagnostic testing required before ART initiation should be performed on the same day as HIV testing/diagnosis. This may require modifying clinic procedures to enable overnight blood storage if same-day draws cannot be performed, and providing additional counseling to encourage newly-diagnosed individuals to complete day-of-diagnosis testing. Tracking HIV+ individuals via clinic registries should commence immediately from diagnosis to reduce these early losses to care...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Research {{that seeks}} to enroll noncompetent {{patients}} with Alzheimer’s disease without presenting any potential benefit to participants {{is the source of}} substantial ethical controversy. The authors used hypothetical Alzheimer’s disease studies that included either a <b>blood</b> <b>draw</b> or a <b>blood</b> <b>draw</b> and lumbar puncture to explore older persons’ attitudes on this question. METHOD: Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 538 persons age 65 and older. Questions explored participants’ understanding of research concepts, their views on enrolling persons with Alzheimer’s disease in research, and their preferences regarding having a proxy decision maker, granting advance consent, and granting their proxy leeway to override the participant’s decision. Additional questions assessed altruism, trust, value for research, and perceptions of Alzheimer’s disease. RESULTS: The majority (83 %) were willing to grant advance consent to a <b>blood</b> <b>draw</b> study, and nearly half (48 %) to a <b>blood</b> <b>draw</b> plus lumbar puncture study. Most (96 %) were willing to identify a proxy for research decision making, and most were willing to grant their proxy leeway over their advance consent: 81 % for the <b>blood</b> <b>draw</b> study and 70 % for the <b>blood</b> <b>draw</b> plus lumbar puncture study. Combining the preferences for advance consent and leeway, the proportion who would permit being enrolled in the <b>blood</b> <b>draw</b> and lumbar puncture studies, respectively, were 92 % and 75 %. Multivariate models showed that willingness to be enrolled in research was most strongly associated with a favorable attitude toward biomedical research. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults generally support enrolling noncompetent persons with Alzheimer’s disease into research that does not present a benefit to subjects. Willingness to grant their proxy leeway over advance consent and a favorable attitude about biomedical research substantially explain this willingness...|$|R

50|$|Two {{other factors}} {{significantly}} affect glucose measurement: hematocrit and delay after <b>blood</b> <b>drawing.</b> The disparity between venous and whole blood concentrations is greater when the hematocrit is high, as in newborn infants, or adults with polycythemia. High neonatal hematocrits are particularly likely to confound glucose measurement by meter. Second, unless the specimen is {{drawn into a}} fluoride tube or processed immediately to separate the serum or plasma from the cells, the measurable glucose will be gradually lowered by in vitro metabolism of the glucose {{at a rate of}} approximately 7 mg/dL/h, or even more in the presence of leukocytosis. The delay that occurs when blood is drawn at a satellite site and transported to a central laboratory hours later for routine processing is a common cause of mildly low glucose levels in general chemistry panels.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} titled Biological Material Collection in the Development Context. The {{bachelor}} thesis is divided to several parts. Blood, important representatives, {{access to the}} bloodstream, tools, <b>blood</b> <b>drawing,</b> the present collection systems and {{last but not least}} the collection rooms. In {{the first part of the}} thesis we dealt with the blood itself. With what the blood actually is. The next part is dedicated to the important representatives. Here we can learn about Galen, the doctor of gladiators, or William Harvey, the discoverer of the blood circulation. Cristannus de Prachaticzis another important representative in this chapter, but also Jan Janský, the "inventor" of the blood groups. The third part deals with the access to the bloodstream. In this part we can read what bloodletting is and how it is performed (e. g. by application of flasks or leeches). Tools used for <b>blood</b> <b>drawing</b> are dealt with in the next part. Injection syringes, injection needles, vessels for <b>blood</b> <b>drawing,</b> bandage materials, gloves, tourniquets and also glucometers are mentioned here. Each of the tools is described from the oldest written reference up to the present. The fifth part deals with <b>blood</b> <b>drawing.</b> Here you can learn about the necessary preparations contained in test tubes and about the history as well as the present situation of collection of capillary as well as venous blood. The present collection systems form another no less important part of this bachelor thesis. Here we learn how the BD Vacutainer and the Sarstedt system operate. There are also obvious differences between the above systems (not only in the colour of the tubes, but also in the application itself). The last part deals with collection rooms. It explains what collection rooms looked like in the past (from the first written reference) and how they gradually changed, not only in terms of the equipment, up to the present...|$|E

40|$|Background: Parents, {{caregivers}} {{and mental health}} professionals have often reported violence and aggression in children or adolescents with autistic disorder. However, most of these observations derived from anecdotal reports, and studies on frequency and characterization of aggression in autism remain limited. Our objective was to better characterize and understand {{the different types of}} aggressive behaviors displayed by a large group of individuals with autism in different observational situations. Methodology/Findings: The study was conducted on 74 children and adolescents with autism and 115 typically developing control individuals matched for sex, age and pubertal stage. Other-Injurious Behaviors (OIB) were assessed in three observational situations (parents at home, two caregivers at day-care, a nurse and a child psychiatrist during <b>blood</b> <b>drawing)</b> using validated scales. The frequency of OIB was significantly higher in individuals with autism compared to typically developing control individuals during the <b>blood</b> <b>drawing</b> (23 % vs. 0 %, P, 0. 01). The parents observed significantly less OIB in their children than caregivers (34 % vs. 58 %, P, 0. 05). In addition, the most frequent concurrent behaviors occurring just before the appearance of OIB in individuals with autism were anxiety-related behaviors and excitation according to the parental as well as the caregiver observation. Conclusions/Significance: The results suggest that in a stressful situation, such as the <b>blood</b> <b>drawing,</b> individuals wit...|$|E
