40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to analyse possibilities of making different woollen <b>blend</b> <b>yarns</b> with sheep’s wool and dog’s hair fibers and to investigate geometrical and mechanical properties of these yarns. In this paper sheep’s wool and dogs’ hair fibers were compared one with other in different geometrical (fibre surface, length, diameter, linear density) and mechanical (breaking tenacity, elongation at break, breaking toughness) properties. It was estimated that the sheep’s and the dog’s fibers are visually very different, they have various types of scales, also most of the dog’s hair have channels inside them. On the next stage of this work the woollen <b>blend</b> <b>yarns</b> were made by mixing the wool of German Blackface sheep with different breed (English Spaniel, Poodle, Yorkshire Terrier) dogs’ hair 15  %, 25  % and 35  %. After evaluating the linear density and mechanical properties of woollen <b>blend</b> <b>yarns,</b> it was estimated that influence of fiber composition in the yarns on these properties is different. Different values of the investigated properties are mostly influenced by spinning system of these yarns. The condenser spinning system affects inequality and unpredictable properties of woollen <b>blend</b> <b>yarns.</b> Also, obtained results depend on the breed of protein fibers, hairy surface, hollow structure and bending rigidity of fiber, the technological process or even compatibility of used devices.

In this study, five different PTT <b>blended</b> <b>yarns</b> were used for the development of weft knitted fabrics for sweaters, which are traditionally produced with wool and acrylic fiber yarns.

Results of <b>blended</b> <b>yarn</b> processing in knitting showed that migration of polypropylene fibres in direction to the yarn surface leads to significant increase of yarn breakages due to growth of its friction coefficient.
