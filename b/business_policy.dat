40|$|Introduction Application {{development}} has {{to cope with}} frequently changing requirements which are {{to a large extent}} due to changes in the business environment [Loucopoulos et al. 1991]. These facets of business environments are often referred to as <b>business</b> <b>policies.</b> They may be based on ethics, law, culture and organizational commitments by either prescribing a certain action or by constraining the set of possible actions [Odell 1994]. Two main problems arise in the context of implementing <b>business</b> <b>policies.</b> Firstly, <b>business</b> <b>policies</b> are often blurred with code for implementing the basic, unchanging functionality of an application. This makes it difficult to cope with their dynamic nature. This problem can be resolved by factorising out <b>business</b> <b>policies</b> from single applications and representing them in terms of Event/Condition/Action rules (ECA rules). These rules allow the designer to monitor situations represented by event...|$|R

This papers reports on a semantic, knowledge-based approach for <b>business</b> <b>policies</b> representation, conflict detection and argumentation based resolution, leading to a justifiable conclusion. We also propose an architecture for enterprise-wide information system to integrate <b>business</b> <b>policies</b> about a given subject spanning across different information systems in an enterprise for decision making purposes...|$|R

In May 1946, he decided the agreement with Wilkerson had to be altered to give him control of the Flamingo.

He believed these attractions would lure not only the high rollers, but thousands of vacationers willing to gamble $50 or $100. Wilkerson was eventually coerced into selling all stakes in the Flamingo under the threat of death, and went into hiding in Paris for a time. From this point the Flamingo became syndicate-run.|$|E

30|$|A {{policy can}} be defined as a plan of action agreed and chosen by a group of people, organization, or {{political}} party. In <b>business,</b> <b>policies</b> can be categorized as internal or external. The internal policies guide and spell out how business activities are run. The internal policies, also known as <b>business</b> <b>policies,</b> are set by the owners and management of a business, and determine their scope of operations (Oviatt & McDougall, 2005). But these <b>business</b> <b>policies</b> are dependent and often influenced by the overall government policies within the economy in which entrepreneurs operate. The government policies therefore, are external policies which are not within the direct control of the entrepreneurs within the economy. Hence, this study focuses on the entrepreneurship policies made by governments.|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to examine the factors that {{determine}} the <b>business</b> <b>policies</b> of private enterprises in the People’s Republic of China. Little is known about these private enterprises although these are surpassing the state-owned enterprises to become the most important corporate sector in China. The phenomenal growths of these enterprises provide an interesting setting to study the effect of the investment opportunity set (IOS) on <b>business</b> <b>policies.</b> We also examine how a firm’s political connection, generally believed to be instrumental to a firm’s success in transition economies, affects its <b>business</b> <b>policies.</b> We provide evidence on the importance of these factors in shaping the private firms’ <b>business</b> <b>policies</b> in China. More specifically, our results show that growth firms pay lower dividends, have lower overdue receivables relative to sales, have higher percentage of bonus shares, and are more likely to engage in joint ventures. In addition, firms with better political connection are able to borrow more, are more likely to establish a board of directors, and are more likely to acquire SOEs. These results have policy implications with regard to private enterprises in transitional economies in general and those in China in particular...|$|R

The suggestion of a temporary 'time-out' from the EuroZone for Greece by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble and a German Finance Ministry suggestion that Greece move titles to Greek assets - including heritage sites and islands to an [...] "external fund" [...] based in Luxembourg to serve as collateral in exchange for bail-out money from the EU-ECB-IMF troika; infuriated many policy-makers who perceived Germany's demands as humiliating punishment and refreshed memories to post-WWII reparations owed by the German government which were never fully repaid due to extensive debt-relief accorded to Germany. Pablo Iglesias, a prominent anti-austerity leader in Spain, hailed the Greek rejection of the bailout plan and expressed solidarity with Greece: [...] "We don’t want to be a German colony". In Italy, Beppe Grillo mocked Germany and the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the IMF troika of lenders saying [...] "Now Merkel and bankers will have food for thought.". Jacob Soll, professor of history and accounting at the University of Southern California, summarized the sentiment amongst academics in Germany: [...] "Germans were honest dupes and the Greeks corrupt, unreliable and incompetent.". Expressing dismay about the far-reaching geopolitical implications of Greece leaving the Eurozone, Timothy Garton Ash, professor of European studies at Oxford University, termed the German-inspired policy prescriptions as deeply flawed and possibly unachievable by Greece [...] "even with the best political will in the world." [...] and warned how the Grexit ("Greece exit") will be perceived elsewhere: [...] "EU can’t get its act together" [...] adding {{that it would be a}} [...] "huge blow for the EU particularly in the eyes of the outside world: China, India, Russia, and the U.S., not to mention closer neighbors." [...] Leading academics and analysts highlighted that EuroZone anti-deficit policies forced upon Greece by the German-backed troika to curb public spending had brought about deflationary pressure, weakened demand and led to widespread unemployment in several EuroZone countries. Paul Krugman, a Nobel economics winner, stated that he was troubled by the actions of the troika to use economics as a weapon to force a regime change in Greece. Fellow Nobel economics laureate Joseph Stiglitz squarely faulted the troika for imposing upon Greece an [...] "unconscionable torture of the present". Wharton finance professor Bulent Gultekin opined: [...] "The endless austerity measures have made it worse for the country. It's been the wrong remedy for the wrong patient at the wrong time". John Cochrane, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University pointed to the source of the current crisis : [...] "Europe should not have bailed out German and French banks and allowed Greece to default in the first instance. In a currency union, {{sovereign debt}} is like corporate debt. Corporations default — or they should — without bailouts, and don’t leave a currency zone when they do so. Europe should not have allowed and encouraged national banks to load up on national debts." [...] Francesco Caselli, professor of economics at the London School of Economics, opined that Greece should [...] "focus on structural reforms rather than austerity. Greece should have gotten meaningful debt relief and much more time to balance the deficit." [...] Olivier Chatain, strategy and <b>business</b> <b>policy</b> professor at HEC business school in Paris opined: [...] "There's a big chasm between what's asked of Greece and what they can do." [...] Mauro Guillén, Wharton management professor and director of The Lauder Institute urged an effort from the creditor nations: [...] "Wages in Germany should rise and government demand for goods and services should increase,(...) Surplus economies, like Germany and the Netherlands, who can spend more should do so". Patrick Minford, professor of economics at Cardiff University in Wales pointedly observed the destructive nature of German economic policies which result in massive trade surpluses for Germany while pauperising weaker EuroZone countries: [...] "unhealthy for Germany to run very large trade surpluses. They’re sabotaging the rest of Europe." [...] Richard Koo, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute assessed the current situation saying: [...] "Greece's debt cannot be paid back under any circumstances, (..) They need to undergo bankruptcy proceedings. We cannot move forward until the Germans and Dutch begin to realize this money will never get paid back and [...] are pushing the Greek economy further into depression." ...|$|E

40|$|Today, {{organizations}} {{often need}} {{to modify their}} business processes to cope with changes in the environment, such as mergers/acquisitions, new government regulations, and new customer demand. Most organizations also {{have a set of}} <b>business</b> <b>policies</b> defining the way they conduct their business. Although there has been extensive research on process analysis and design, how to systematically extract workflow models from <b>business</b> <b>policies</b> has not been studied, resulting in a missing link between the specification of <b>business</b> <b>policies</b> and the modeling of business processes. Given that process changes are often determined by executives and managers at the policy level, the aforementioned missing link often leads to inefficient and inaccurate implementation of process changes by business analysts and process designers. We refer to this problem as the policy mismatch problem in business process management. For organizations with large-scale business processes and a large number of <b>business</b> <b>policies,</b> solving the policy mismatch problem is very difficult and challenging. In this dissertation, we attempt to provide a formal link between <b>business</b> <b>policies</b> and workflow models by proposing a logic-based methodology for process analysis and design. In particular, we first propose a Policy-driven Process Design (PPD) methodology to formalize the procedure of extracting workflow models from <b>business</b> <b>policies.</b> In PPD, narrative process policies are parsed into precise information on various workflow components, and a set of process design rules and algorithms are applied to generate workflow models from that information. We also develop a logic-based process modeling language named Unified Predicate Language (UPL). UPL is able to represent all workflow components in a single logic format and provides analytical capability via logic inference and query. We demonstrate UPL's expressive power and analytical ability by applying it to process design and process change analysis. In particular, we use UPL to define and classify process change anomalies and develop algorithms to verify and enforce process consistency. The Policy-driven Process Design, Unified Predicate Language, and process change analysis approach found in this dissertation contribute to business process management research by providing a formal methodology for resolving the policy mismatch problem...|$|R

6000|$|Sailors {{were very}} {{plentiful}} in this crowd. It {{seemed to me}} that one man in four was looking for a ship, and I found at least a dozen of them to be American sailors. In accounting for their being [...] "on the beach," [...] I received the same story from each and all, and from my knowledge of sea affairs this story rang true. English ships sign their sailors for the voyage, which means the round trip, sometimes lasting as long as three years; and they cannot sign off and receive their discharges until they reach the home port, which is England. Their wages are low, their food is bad, and their treatment worse. Very often they are really forced by their captains to desert in the New World or the colonies, leaving a handsome sum of wages behind them--a distinct gain, either to the captain or the owners, or to both. But whether for this reason alone or not, {{it is a fact that}} large numbers of them desert. Then, for the home voyage, the ship engages whatever sailors it can find on the beach. These men are engaged at the somewhat higher wages that obtain in other portions of the world, under the agreement that they shall sign off on reaching England. The reason for this is obvious; for it would be poor <b>business</b> <b>policy</b> to sign them for any longer time, since seamen's wages are low in England, and England is always crowded with sailormen on the beach. So this fully accounted for the American seamen at the Salvation Army barracks. To get off the beach in other outlandish places they had come to England, and gone on the beach in the most outlandish place of all.|$|E
