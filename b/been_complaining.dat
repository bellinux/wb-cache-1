5|$|Unlike Saraiva, Ouro Preto was {{a staunch}} monarchist who was {{determined}} to save the regime at any cost. His program of reforms was highly ambitious and aimed at resolving festering issues about which politicians had long <b>been</b> <b>complaining.</b> An item notably missing from his agenda was any move to address the military indiscipline and the urgent necessity of restoration of government authority over the corps. This {{would prove to be}} a fatal mistake. Among the reforms proposed were the expanding of voting rights by abolishing the income requisite, the end of lifelong senate tenures and, most important of all, increased decentralization which would turn the country into a full federation by allowing the election of town mayors and provincial presidents (governors).|$|E
5|$|Regular pit stops {{started on}} lap eleven, with Massa, Kvyat, Pérez and Grosjean {{being the first}} to come in. In addition, Nico Hülkenberg made a pit stop and exited ahead of both Massa and Kvyat, who both had been {{in front of him}} before their {{respective}} stops. Bottas came in a lap later and maintained position. Kimi Räikkönen, who had <b>been</b> <b>complaining</b> about lack of grip in his front tyres, made a pit stop on lap 13. Race leader Rosberg came in for his tyre change on lap fourteen, simultaneously with Vettel, while Hamilton stayed out for another lap. He was ultimately unable to use his additional lap to come out in front of his teammate and remained second. On lap 18, Nico Hülkenberg, who was suffering from an unstable car, overtook Maldonado for sixth place. Around lap 20, Hamilton was moving closer to Rosberg, being in DRS range for multiple laps before reporting to the garage that his tyres would not last long and eased up. On lap 22, Kvyat moved ahead of Maldonado as well and was now seventh. Lap 24 witnessed Massa go around Maldonado as well, while Felipe Nasr overtook Button for 14th.|$|E

The move continues to receive strong support while continuing to gain momentum during the Jallikattu protests.|$|E
25|$|According to the strikers, it {{all began}} because {{of the price of}} pork chop dinner in the factory's canteen. On July 8, one worker noticed that {{overnight}} it had been increased by 80% - from 10.20 zlotys, to 18.10 zlotys. The workers, who for a long time had <b>been</b> <b>complaining</b> about prices and quality of food, decided that they had had enough. Following the inspiration of Miroslaw Kaczan who switched off the machines, Section W-340 was first, but after a few hours, the whole factory stopped working. On the same days, following Świdnik's example, workers of Lublin's branch of the state Polmozbyt auto parts and repairs service joined the strike. A Stoppage Committee was created in Świdnik, headed by Zofia Bartkiewicz, which demanded economic concessions. The workers did not use the irritating word strike on purpose.|$|E

500|$|The {{layout of}} city streets and roads has often drawn complaints.

He later apologized, though people had <b>been</b> <b>complaining</b> about the fractured grid system {{for more than a}} century by that point. Some of the city's road design is the result of the curve of the Mississippi River, hilly topography, conflicts between developers of different neighborhoods in the early city, and grand plans only half-realized. Outside of downtown, the roads are less confusing, but most roads are named, rather than numbered, increasing the difficulty for non-natives to navigate.|$|E

David Oliver of CHUD.com gave the episode an 8.6 rating out of 10, and commented {{that it was a}} [...] "good" [...] episode, though he was [...] "bummed" [...] to see Daniel go.

500|$|The mountainous {{terrain and}} {{geographic}} features of El Hatillo {{have made it}} difficult to extend the Caracas Metro to southeast Caracas, so the main transportation methods in the municipality are private vehicles and road public transportation. An extension of the Metro – Line 5 – has been proposed, but construction has not been initiated as of 2007; phase 2 of Line 4 is still under construction. Urban planning in the municipality has been unorganised; news archives show that at least since 1998, neighbors have <b>been</b> <b>complaining</b> about the dense traffic caused by new residential and commercial construction, yet new or enhanced alternative roads to resolve the traffic problems have not been completed. A south beltway suggested 25 years ago has not been constructed due to its high cost. [...] However, as of January 2006, a new route that will connect La Lagunita with Macaracuay – a neighborhood in northeast Caracas – is under construction and is planned to be completed in 2010; according to Mayor Catalán, 23% of El Hatillo's inhabitants will eventually use this transit way. Its cost was estimated in early 2006 as US$19,572,000.|$|E
500|$|A later {{analysis}} by the Toronto Star in 2011 suggested that the [...] "macho" [...] attitude of the NHL in that era, {{as well as his}} aggressive playing style, {{played a significant role in}} Masterton's death. [...] Coach Wren Blair believed that Masterton was playing despite a pre-existing brain hemorrhage, and was concerned enough that he wanted to have Masterton checked out by a doctor. [...] However, Masterton brushed it off. [...] Longtime NHL coach John Muckler, who was then the coach of the Stars' second-tier farm team, the Memphis South Stars, believed that Masterton may have suffered a brain injury as early as training camp. [...] During the season, several players and coaches recalled seeing Masterton black out during rushes in practice. [...] Goaltender Cesare Maniago recalled that the night before the fatal hit, Masterton had <b>been</b> <b>complaining</b> of severe migraines that he'd had for over a week. [...] They felt it caused what was otherwise viewed as a routine, albeit hard, bodycheck to turn fatal. [...] Toronto neurosurgeon and concussion expert Charles Tator reviewed Masterton's autopsy and opined that Masterton had suffered second-impact syndrome, which occurs when a person suffers a second concussion on top of an earlier, untreated concussion. [...] When this happens, it can cause rapid and often fatal brain swelling.|$|E
500|$|Rob Salem of Toronto Star {{said that}} [...] "fans who have <b>been</b> <b>complaining</b> about this season’s {{relative}} complacency [...] finally got their gore and more when the farm was overrun by suddenly, strangely single-minded walkers." [...] Pamela Mitchell of Houston Chronicle commented that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] {{was the most}} eventful episode of the season, while Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery thought that [...] "every single major character gets their moment to shine"; [...] "Epic, action-packed, emotional—'Beside the Dying Fire' is great television," [...] she concluded. TV Guide television critic Michael Logan affirmed that the season finale [...] "was so scary and shock-a-minute outrageous that it nearly made our heads explode." [...] In his A– review, Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club said that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] adequately accomplished what he was hoping for. He wrote, [...] "We're finally off Hershel's farm, in about the most definitive way imaginable: The barn has been burned, and the house itself is overrun by a herd of 'walkers'." [...] New York Starlee Kine adulated the installment, and asserted that it was comparable to episodes of The Walking Dead first season. [...] "It’s just amazing how much smoother the plot holes go down when something is actually happening on this show. For {{the first time since}} last season, I felt engrossed enough to not be consumed with all the small things this show gets wrong. Up until this episode, the majority of this season has consisted exclusively of small things: petty dramas, misdirected stakes, so much stalling. I’m not sure I can {{go so far as to}} say that it got everything right with this one, but at least it was entertaining and the nonstop action felt like content instead of just bookends." [...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald wrote that it was the closest the program [...] "ever resembled the climax of a George Romero film." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings felt that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] sufficiently encompassed a climax for its storylines, adding that it left the audience anticipating for future installments of the series.|$|E

2500|$|For years, {{residents}} {{in the southern part}} of the New Mexico Territory had <b>been</b> <b>complaining</b> that the territorial government in Santa Fe was too far away to properly address their concerns. The withdrawal of the Regular army at the beginning of the war confirmed to the residents that they were being abandoned. Secession conventions in Mesilla and Tucson voted to join the territory to the Confederacy in March 1861, and formed militia companies to defend themselves. In July 1861, Lieutenant Colonel John Baylor led a battalion of Texas mounted rifles into the southern portion of the New Mexico Territory, entering Mesilla and repulsing the attack of the Union garrison of Fort Fillmore at the First Battle of Mesilla. [...] The victorious Baylor established the Confederate Territory of Arizona south of the 34th parallel.|$|E
2500|$|In 1921 two {{returned}} servicemen, Leonard Overheu and Frederick Hay, {{applied for}} a grant under the War Service Land Settlement Scheme. Nulla Nulla station was excised from the Marndoc Aboriginal reserve with the traditional owners, the King River Aborigines, removed and forced {{to live on the}} outskirts of Wyndham. By late 1925 the Kimberleys had suffered two years of severe drought. Heavy rains in early 1926 filled the waterholes, which resulted in large groups of Aborigines entering the Marndoc reserve, killing cattle for food. Hay and Overheu had <b>been</b> <b>complaining</b> about the spearing of their cattle, claiming it was [...] "part of a conspiracy" [...] against Nulla Nulla by the Rev. Ernest Gribble of the nearby Forrest River Mission (later renamed Oombulgurri). In response, Sergeant Buckland from Wyndham had the station declared a prohibited area under the 1905 Aborigines Act preventing Aborigines from entering or crossing it to reach other areas. On 18 May, Overheu made a formal complaint that a large mob of Aborigines were spearing cattle on the station and along with Aboriginal employee Tommy Doort, his wife Lyddie and two stock boys camped on the lower Pentecost River to await the arrival of police.|$|E

The study was a cross-sectional survey that used a self-administered structured questionnaire to collect primary data from 448 customers from ten selected banks in Ghana.
