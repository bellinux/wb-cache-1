Auctioning permits can therefore <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> and equitable than allocating permits (Hepburn, 2006, pp.236â€“237). Ross Garnaut states that full auctioning will provide greater transparency and accountability and lower implementation and transaction costs as governments retain control over the permit revenue.|$|E

The box would be located next to the water plugs throughout the city districts in the manner previously mentioned.

SNECMA was also responsible for the initial airframe integration engineering, mostly involving the nacelle design, and was initially responsible for the gearbox, but shifted that work to GE when it became apparent that it would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> for GE to assemble that component along with their other parts.|$|E

It also included provisions for civil service reform, requiring that city jobs be filled by merit selection rather than patronage. In the November elections, Democrats won control of city government from Republicans {{for the first time in}} 67 years. After narrowly winning a primary race against labor lawyer Harry Galfand, Dallas was elected as a part of that wave, winning 54% of the vote in the new 8th district (covering Chestnut Hill, Germantown, and Roxborough) over incumbent Republican councilman Robert S. Hamilton (the new charter did away with multi-member council districts).|$|E
5|$|Modern {{ambulances}} {{are typically}} powered by internal combustion engines, {{which can be}} powered by any conventional fuel, including diesel, gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas, depending on the preference of the operator {{and the availability of}} different options. Colder regions often use gasoline-powered engines, as diesels can be difficult to start when they are cold. Warmer regions may favor diesel engines, as they are thought to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> and more durable. Diesel power is sometimes chosen due to safety concerns, after a series of fires involving gasoline-powered ambulances during the 1980s. These fires were ultimately attributed in part to gasoline's higher volatility in comparison to diesel fuel. The type of engine may be determined by the manufacturer: in the past two decades, Ford would only sell vehicles for ambulance conversion if they are diesel-powered. Beginning in 2010, Ford will sell its ambulance chassis with a gasoline engine in order to meet emissions requirements.|$|E

40|$|Ownership may {{not always}} be the best driver for {{investment}} incentives in an incomplete contract context.

In particular, outside veto <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> than ownership because it reduces the incentive to invest on substitute assets. And joint veto <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> than ownership because it protects the incentives of highly productive agents while preventing them to merge the asset with substitute assets.
