5|$|The team {{took several}} wins in August. Dumoulin took a {{win in the}} first stage of Paris–Corrèze, <b>breaking</b> <b>away</b> {{near the end of the}} day to finish 4 seconds better than the main field. By {{finishing}} in the front group the next day, he secured overall victory in the two-day event. On the same day Dumoulin secured Paris–Corrèze, Cusin narrowly defeated 's Matti Breschel at the end of stage 2 at the Tour of Denmark. After laying 28 seconds down in the overall classification before the final day at the Tour de l'Ain, Moncoutié secured overall victory the next day. He missed out on the stage win to 's Thibaut Pinot, but by finishing only 3 seconds back he moved past previous race leader Wout Poels to win the event itself. Lastly, Gallopin took a stage at the Tour du Limousin. He took his second win of the season by <b>breaking</b> <b>away</b> from the peloton within stage's final kilometer, and holding on for first by 6 seconds.|$|E
5|$|As the {{dissolution}} of Austria-Hungary was taking effect in October 1918, other such units were spontaneously formed on Austrian territory, mainly from rogue components of the Imperial Army. The Romanian Legion of Prague helped the Czechoslovak National Council and the Sokols gain the upper hand during an anti-Austrian uprising, while other Romanian units were <b>breaking</b> <b>away</b> from Austrian command in Vienna. Romanians also formed a distinct segment of the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine personnel who rioted on the Austrian Littoral {{and elsewhere in the}} Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines {{were left}} in an {{unstable}} position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at a good time — the weakening of the Sultanate of Rum resulted in many beyliks <b>breaking</b> <b>away</b> as autonomous states, such as the Emirate founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the Empire of Nicaea a temporary free hand, it {{was nothing more than}} a small respite not capitalized as much as it could have been.|$|E

Earlier bronze braces that had been used to stabilise surfaces were removed in those places where they were causing cracking, and the holes filled. Pigments that appeared to be not well adhered were consolidated with the application of diluted acrylic resin.|$|E
5|$|The laconic Act is {{the legal}} basis for the {{existence}} of modern Lithuania, both during the interwar period and since 1990. The Act formulated the basic constitutional principles that were and still are followed by all Constitutions of Lithuania. The Act itself was a key element in the foundation of Lithuania's re-establishment of independence in 1990. Lithuania, <b>breaking</b> <b>away</b> from the Soviet Union, stressed that it was simply re-establishing the independent state that existed between the world wars and that the Act never lost its legal power.|$|E
5|$|After {{escaping}} the Machias men, the Margaretta {{was forced to}} jibe into brisk winds, {{which resulted in the}} main boom and gaff <b>breaking</b> <b>away,</b> crippling its navigability. Once Moore was in Holmes Bay he captured a sloop and took its spar and gaff to replace the Margaretta's. Moore also took its pilot, Robert Avery, captive. The Unity crew of about 30 Machias men elected Jeremiah O'Brien as their captain and sailed out to chase down the Margaretta. Since the Unity was a much faster sailing vessel, O'Brien's crew quickly caught up to the crippled Margaretta, while the Falmouth Packet lagged behind.|$|E

5|$|The country {{owes its}} varied topography, {{and perhaps even}} its {{emergence}} above the waves, to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the Pacific and Indo-Australian Plates. New Zealand is part of Zealandia, a microcontinent nearly {{half the size of}} Australia that gradually submerged after <b>breaking</b> <b>away</b> from the Gondwanan supercontinent. About 25 million years ago, a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and crumple the region. This is now most evident in the Southern Alps, formed by compression of the crust beside the Alpine Fault. Elsewhere the plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other, producing the Puysegur Trench to the south, the Hikurangi Trench east of the North Island, and the Kermadec and Tonga Trenches further north.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, A Town Where You Live manga volumes {{frequently}} {{appeared on}} weekly sales charts during their week of release. Jason Thompson praised A Town Where You Lives serious, mature tone and {{wrote that the}} audiences will either like the series for its realism or criticize it as slow and mundane. Manga-News praised the series' introduction for being more realistic than the author's previous work, Suzuka, and the plot which was described as eventful. In later volumes, Manga-News criticized the plot for being predictable, encompassing cliché aspects of the genre, and for dragging its story. They also panned the characters' behavior, calling it implausible and inconsistent. Manga-News returned to positive reviews during the volumes involving Kyousuke Kazama; they praised the story arc for introducing a new setting, for <b>breaking</b> <b>away</b> from the usual classicism, and for surprising the readers {{for the first time}} in the series. Following this, Manga-News returned to negative reviews, echoing their previous points. AnimeLand had similar reactions. Initially, they were positive, praising the realistic protagonist, but further reviews repeated Manga-News' criticisms.|$|E
5|$|In the {{southern}} regions of Karnataka, the Western Gangas of Talakad were contemporaries of the Kadambas. The Kadambas and Gangas {{were followed by}} the imperial dynasties of the Badami Chalukya Empire, the Rashtrakuta Empire, the Western Chalukya Empire, the Hoysala Empire and the Vijayanagara Empire, all patronising the ancient Indic religions while showing tolerance to the new cultures arriving from {{the west of the}} subcontinent. The Muslim invasion of the Deccan resulted in the <b>breaking</b> <b>away</b> of the feudatory Sultanates in the 14th century. The rule of the Bahamani Sultanate of Bidar and the Bijapur Sultanate from the northern Deccan region caused a mingling of the ancient Hindu traditions with the nascent Islamic culture in the region. The hereditary ruling families and clans ably served the large empires and upheld the local culture and traditions. The fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 brought about a slow disintegration of Kannada-speaking regions into minor kingdoms that struggled to maintain autonomy in an age dominated by foreigners until unification and independence in 1947.|$|E

5|$|The {{paintings}} of the Italian Renaissance differed {{from those of the}} Northern Renaissance. Italian Renaissance artists {{were among the first to}} paint secular scenes, <b>breaking</b> <b>away</b> from the purely religious art of medieval painters. Northern Renaissance artists initially remained focused on religious subjects, such as the contemporary religious upheaval portrayed by Albrecht Dürer. Later, the works of Pieter Bruegel influenced artists to paint scenes of daily life rather than religious or classical themes. It was also during the Northern Renaissance that Flemish brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck perfected the oil painting technique, which enabled artists to produce strong colors on a hard surface that could survive for centuries. A feature of the Northern Renaissance was its use of the vernacular in place of Latin or Greek, which allowed greater freedom of expression. This movement had started in Italy with the decisive influence of Dante Alighieri on the development of vernacular languages; in fact the focus on writing in Italian has neglected a major source of Florentine ideas expressed in Latin. The spread of the printing press technology boosted the Renaissance in Northern Europe as elsewhere, with Venice becoming a world center of printing.|$|E
5|$|The series {{then moved}} on to Britain, where Roberts would be {{involved}} in one of the closest races in Grand Prix history. Roberts' battle with Sheene at the 1979 British Grand Prix at Silverstone has been cited {{as one of the greatest}} races of the 1970s. Minutes before the start of the race, Roberts' Yamaha blew a seal and sprayed the bike with oil. His crew managed to replace the seal in time, but Roberts went to the starting line with his gloves coated with oil, causing his hand to slip on the throttle during the race. The race began with Roberts, Sheene and Dutch rider Wil Hartog <b>breaking</b> <b>away</b> from the rest of the field of riders. Hartog eventually fell behind as Roberts and Sheene continued to battle for the lead. The event featured numerous lead changes throughout the 28 lap race, with Roberts winning ahead of Sheene by a narrow margin of just three-tenths of a second. A third-place finish in the season-ending French Grand Prix, along with a crash by his main championship rival Ferrari, secured his second consecutive world championship.|$|E
5|$|Difficult {{conditions}} {{greeted the}} teams upon their {{arrival at the}} Silverstone Circuit, as parts of the Midlands received a month's rainfall {{in the space of}} two days. The torrential rain lasted throughout the weekend, forcing qualifying to be suspended for ninety minutes, before race day dawned clear. The circuit was declared dry, allowing the drivers to start on the tyre compound of their choice, with Alonso on the harder tyre streaking away at the start while Paul di Resta crashed at Aintree on the first lap after making contact with Romain Grosjean. As the leaders settled into a rhythm, Pastor Maldonado and Sergio Pérez collided at Brooklands, prompting an angry response from the Mexican driver. Perez's team mate Kamui Kobayashi also ran into trouble, locking his tyres as he entered his pit box and hitting three members of his pit crew, though none were seriously injured. The race was ultimately decided by the choice of tyre in the first stint as Alonso moved onto the softer option and Webber onto the harder prime for the final phase of the race. Webber caught Alonso with five laps to go, passing him on the Wellington Straight. Webber held on for his second win of the season, with Vettel third and Felipe Massa in fourth, his best result since achieving a podium in South Korea in 2010. The result meant Webber closed to within thirteen points of Alonso's championship lead, with both drivers <b>breaking</b> <b>away</b> from third-placed Vettel. After showing early promise in the wet conditions, McLaren went backwards in the dry, losing second place in the Constructors' Championship to Ferrari and third to Lotus.|$|E

5|$|Scottish {{politics}} in the late 18th century and throughout the 19th century was dominated by the Whigs and (after 1859) their successors the Liberal Party. From the Scottish Reform Act 1832 (which {{increased the number of}} Scottish MPs and significantly widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes), {{until the end of the}} century they managed to gain a majority of the Westminster Parliamentary seats for Scotland, although these were often outnumbered by the much larger number of English and Welsh Conservatives. English-educated Scottish peer Lord Aberdeen (1784–1860) led a coalition government from 1852 to 1855, but in general very few Scots held office in the government. From the mid-century there were increasing calls for Home Rule for Scotland and when the Conservative Lord Salisbury became prime minister in 1885 he responded to pressure for more attention to be paid to Scottish issues by reviving the post of Secretary of State for Scotland, which had been in abeyance since 1746. He appointed the Duke of Richmond, a wealthy landowner who was both Chancellor of Aberdeen University and Lord Lieutenant of Banff. Towards the end of the century the first Scottish Liberal to become prime minister was the Earl of Rosebery (1847–1929), like Aberdeen before him a product of the English education system. In the later 19th century the issue of Irish Home Rule led to a split among the Liberals, with a minority <b>breaking</b> <b>away</b> to form the Liberal Unionists in 1886. The growing importance of the working classes was marked by Keir Hardie's success in the Mid Lanarkshire by-election, 1888, leading to the foundation of the Scottish Labour Party, which was absorbed into the Independent Labour Party in 1895, with Hardie as its first leader.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{leadership}} viewed {{events in}} Poland with alarm. De-Stalinisation was underway in the Soviet Union as well, but the Soviet leadership did not view the democratic reform that the Polish public desired as an acceptable solution. In Moscow, the belief was that any liberalisation in one bloc country {{could lead to}} the destruction of communism and the ruin of Soviet influence in the region as a whole. The Soviet Union was not worried solely about the political implications of reform but about the economic implications as well. Economically, the Soviet Union heavily invested in much of the Eastern Bloc and was striving for integration of its economies. The Soviet Union had financed Polish industry and was Poland's main trading partner. The Soviet Union directed what products Poland manufactured; the Soviets bought the products and exported goods to Poland no longer produced within the country itself. Due to this integration, any reform, whether political or economic, in one of the countries would inevitably have a great impact on the other. Because Poland was inextricably connected to the Soviet Union economically, the thought of an independent Polish economy was unrealistic. The country had been forced to rely on the Soviets {{for such a long time}} that <b>breaking</b> <b>away</b> completely would prove disastrous. Thus, both countries held crucial power in different facets. Poland could threaten Soviet strength and power in Eastern Europe politically, and the Soviet Union could essentially destroy the Polish economy. Therefore, any reform in the Polish government would have to concede to some Soviet demands, while the Soviets concurrently would have to concede to a vital partner.|$|E
