5000|$|Federal Board of Revenue (previously Central Board of Revenue) {{established}} a company for automation, namely Systems Limited in 1988. Processing was completed on IBM system-34 machine. There were standalone systems in every Collectorate. Goods Declaration (then called B/E - <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry)</b> was submitted and a machine number was allocated manually. For this purpose a register was maintained. Data, regarding value {{was used to}} be given by the computer operator {{in the form of}} an assessment sheet (at this stage some customs brokers managed to get values of their choice as values could be maneuvered by the computer operator). The print out of the sheet was attached with the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> (B/E) and sent to the group in routine. After completion of B/E and out of customs charge, manual feeding in the computer system was done by KPOs of Computer Bureau through batch processing. [...] In December, 1992 computer processing (online processing) of bill of entries was started in Appraisement Collectorate. Between 1992 and 1999 feeding of hard copies of B/Es in the computer was done by the KPOs of import section. A running number was allocated to B/Es by the computer, which was manually affixed on the B/E. Assessment was used to be made in the relevant groups and simultaneously entry was recorded in the computer. The system automatically calculated duty. A batch of eight bills of entry was forwarded to the bank with a summary. The bank verified that summary with pay orders which they received. Account section was responsible to make consignments out of customs charge after satisfying that all the taxes and duties are paid in the national exchequer.|$|E

40|$|Maritime {{historians have}} not {{followed}} the trend set by other disciplines towards regional studies {{which has become}} an established practice {{over the past ten}} years. Some excellent work has been done on individual ports but no one has attempted to establish the relationship between the sea trade and the land based economy on a regional basis. This thesis corrects the omission for the region of the North West of England. A study of the coastwise trade and the trade with Ireland in the late eighteenth century, it provides evidence which argues for the existence of an integrated maritime economy in the Irish Sea region in the period 1750 - 1810. Altogether, it demonstrates that a complex regional trade existed alongside increasing overseas trade. The sources to identify coastal trading activity in this period are scarce. With few exceptions, records of the King’s Remembrancer Exchequer Port Books are no longer available, while the run of records <b>of</b> the Customs <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>Entry</b> has not started. One of the challenges, therefore, was to identify alternative sources from which the necessary information could be drawn. Shipping lists published in local newspapers were the principal source used. Other key sources included trade directories, trade reports and business papers. The study of ownership uses the shipping registers from 1786 and examines ownership and relationships with the local economies in greater detail than has been undertaken previously. Research into local sources assisted in identifying the specific business interests of owners, particularly those designated as ‘merchant’ and ‘gentleman’ in the registers. A key finding is that a complex shipping investment pattern existed within the region related to the characteristics of the local economies. Case studies based on surviving business records give insight into the business practices underpinning regional maritime commerce, particularly the use of information networks, methods of payment and the roles of the merchants. The importance of the trust in business relationships is the most prominent characteristic to emerge from these case studies. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Bank has included trade in its service by providing different facilities. They are offering different type of products to make trade more easy and less risky for their customer. Citibank N. A is one of the world largest bank and renowned for their trade service and cash operation management. Citi has started its journey in Bangladesh not a very long time but within a very short time it has captured the market of Bangladesh with its high quality service and transparency. They mainly do corporate banking in Bangladesh. Their one of the main service in Bangladesh is trade service; they also provide cash management service and also have other services for their corporate clients. We can divide the trade into import and export. <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Entry</b> managing is the end point of import. After the payment is done the bank has to report the BOE within 120 days otherwise it will be counted as overdue and the customer will not be able to open any new LC. Bangladesh Bank has regulations of managing BOE. Citi manage the BOE according to the regulations and also according to the global standard. Processing BOE is a complex work as there are different types of BOEs in Bangladesh and no uniform regulations regarding the number of BOE for one bill. Automating the overall process can reduce the complexity and make the process easier. Nabila IslamB. Business Administratio...|$|E

40|$|A tramp ship is {{a vessel}} with no regular {{ports of call}} or sailing schedule. Tramp ships {{normally}} carry low-value, bulk cargoes, such as coal, timber, grain and other raw materials and are usually sent wherever necessary to secure freight and to minimize voyages in ballast. [...] Burrell & Son of Glasgow {{was one of the}} most important British tramp shipping firms of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. George Burrell entered the shipping business as a shipping and forwarding agent in the 1850 s, but his successors took advantage of opportunities in the 1860 s to expand into shipowning, mostly through the purchase of steamers. Over the next sixty-odd years, they engaged in many typical tramp trades and cross-trading. During the Boer War in the late 1890 s, Burrell & Son exited the shipping business. A few years later, it embarked on an ambitious shipbuilding program only to sell its steamships once more, at a considerable profit, during the First World War. [...] The thesis uses quantitative and qualitative methods to analyse British tramp shipping along three broad themes: the acquisition of vessels by a tramp firm; the deployment of these ships and the cargoes they carried; and finally, the crew members who manned them. Crew agreements and <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> allow us to examine some of the business strategies and investment patterns of Burrell & Son and shed some light on the world of tramp shipping. [...] Burrell & Son was a fairly typical British tramp shipowner. The company, for the most part, avoided exposure to risky endeavours and opted for reliability and economy, especially in terms of technological developments. It maintained a relatively young fleet, without establishing an exclusive relationship with any particular shipyard. It remained mindful of the need for economy, reducing costs wherever possible (especially through the reduction of the man/ton ratio and the employment of Asian crew members). Its scope of operations was global and its trade was in low-value, bulk tramp cargoes, but it also participated in less typical enterprises, like the first successful carriage of frozen meat from Australia to the United Kingdom...|$|R

The Florentine merchant banking skills became recognised in Europe after they brought decisive financial innovation (e.g. <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange, double <b>entry</b> book keeping) to medieval fairs. This period also saw the eclipse of Florence's formerly powerful rival Pisa (defeated by Genoa in 1284 and subjugated by Florence in 1406), and the exercise of power by the mercantile elite following an anti-aristocratic movement, led by Giano della Bella, that resulted in a set of laws called the Ordinances of Justice (1293).|$|R

50|$|There are {{two types}} where <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading {{can be used as}} carrier's receipt for goods. The first is on board <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading, also known as clean <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Clean <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is used when there is no {{discrepancy}} between description filled by shipper and the actual goods shipped on board. Clean <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading indicates that the goods have been properly loaded on board the carrier's ship according to the prima facie evidence. If the carrier finds out that the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is different from goods on board, one can provide contradictory evidence on clean <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. It is valid as long as in the hand of the carrier, but once it is transferred and negotiated to the third party, it cannot be rebutted and the carrier can no longer mark discrepancy. The second is claused <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Claused <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is used when there is some discrepancy between description in the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading and the actual goods.

40|$|LL. D. The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading in South African law is {{the theme}} of this study. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading in its {{traditional}} paper form is examined. The aim of the first part of the study is to reconcile the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading that is based on English law with the principles of South African law, especially regarding concepts such as possession and ownership. A plea is made for the application of South African law to <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading rather than English law exclusively. Even though English law undoubtedly forms the basis of the law governing <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading, such law should be applied in a way that is consistent with the general principles of South African law. The functions <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading are considered in detail, particularly the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading as a document of title. A submission is made of five characteristics of a document of title. The conclusion is that the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading, though based on English law concepts, can be integrated into South African law without difficulty. The subsequent examination of the transfer of contractual rights and the imposition of liabilities will show that there is a dire need for new legislation in South Africa to replace an English Act of 1855. The current proposals for such legislation are, however, in need of extensive revision. The fact that the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading only arrives at the port of destination after the goods, leads to a multitude of problems. The carrier may only deliver the goods in exchange for a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Letters of indemnity are therefore used to protect the carrier that delivers the goods without receiving a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Such indemnities will be enforceable in South African law if the carrier has no reason to suspect that the receiver of the goods is not entitled to delivery. The consideration of the nature and functions <b>of</b> the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading, enables the study to progress to an examination <b>of</b> an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. The use <b>of</b> an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading means that many problems facing the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading can be avoided. The continuing evolution <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading will be examined against the background of electronic commerce. Writing and signature requirements should not inhibit the development <b>of</b> an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. The difficulty facing the dematerialisation <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is providing for negotiability in an electronic environment, and ensuring that an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is the equivalent of an original and unique paper <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. It is possible to create an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading that performs all the functions <b>of</b> a traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading, and there are examples of the use <b>of</b> such electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading in practice. Delivery of the goods can take place by way of attomment rather than the usual symbolical delivery following the transfer <b>of</b> a paper <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. It is submitted that there is currently no need for legislative intervention to provide for electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading in South Africa...|$|R
