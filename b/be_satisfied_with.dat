5|$|In October 2014 Elgato {{released}} {{a new version}} called HD 60. It recorded in 60 frames per second and 1080p high definition video, whereas typical low-end video game recording devices capture in 720p and 30 frames per second. The Telegraph gave it {{four out of five}} stars. A review in Gizmodo said that it captured extremely high-quality footage, but it may be higher-end than needed for many gamers that would <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> the recording features built into the console.|$|E

5|$|The 1989 Draft {{has been}} noted as having been {{exceptionally}} successful for Detroit. While team executive Jim Devellano stated the team would <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> two players from that draft {{making it to the}} NHL, seven of them did so. Those seven players (Mike Sillinger, Bob Boughner, Lidstrom, Fedorov, Shawn McCosh, Dallas Drake and Vladimir Konstantinov) amassed 5,995 games played, 1,227 goals, 2,367 assists, 3,594 points and 5,108 penalties in minutes. That draft has also been marked as signalling a paradigm shift for Detroit as prior to that the club was very reluctant to draft players from outside North America. Since then the club has drafted a large number of European as well as other non-North American players. In 2000, for example, they drafted four Swedes, three Russians, two Canadians, one Slovak and one American.|$|E

Whether the pope's influence saved Rome is, however, questioned. The Vandals departed with countless valuables. Eudoxia and her daughter Eudocia were taken to North Africa.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, fans had to <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> the {{achievements}} of Hank Aaron. In the relatively hitter-friendly confines and higher-than-average altitude of Atlanta Stadium ("The Launching Pad"), he actually increased his offensive production. Atlanta also produced batting champions in Rico Carty (in 1970) and Ralph Garr (in 1974). In the shadow of Aaron's historical home run pursuit, {{was the fact that}} three Atlanta sluggers hit 40 or more home runs in 1973 – Darrell Evans, Davey Johnson and, of course, Aaron.|$|E
25|$|A {{controversy}} {{involved the}} decision whether Polish forces should defend the lengthy borders, or withdraw {{east and south}} and try a defense along a shorter line, backed with rivers. Although the second plan was more militarily sound, political considerations outweighed them, as Polish politicians were concerned that Germany could <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> occupation of some disputed territories (like the Free City of Danzig, the Polish Corridor and Silesia), and push for an early {{end of the war}} after occupying those territories. The western regions were also the most densely populated and had major industrial centers, crucial for mobilization and any continued military production of equipment and supply for the Polish Army.|$|E
25|$|After 7,000 Spanish {{troops were}} returned, La Unión {{refused to give}} up any French prisoners. He {{justified}} his decision by stating that the surrender was void without his consent and that Navarro had no authority to release French prisoners. He refused to abide by terms whereby his returned Spanish troops were not eligible to fight the French but that any returned French troops might be used against Spain's allies. He declared that Dugommier should <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> possession of the coastal forts and their contents. When Dugommier furiously wrote to La Unión, asking him to reconsider, the Spanish army commander offered to submit the case to the United States of America for arbitration.|$|E

For African American female workers, this high job satisfaction is associated with high levels of satisfaction with salary. For male African American workers, the situation is more complex. African American male IT workers who <b>are</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> their salaries <b>are</b> also <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> their jobs.

The official agents did their job: Reyna was elected president and, so as not to offend the losing candidates, Barillas gave them checks to cover the costs of their presidential campaigns. Reyna Barrios of course received nothing, but he went on to become President on March 15, 1892.|$|E

On April 4 he hit #714 in Cincinnati, and on April 8, in front of his home fans, he finally beat Ruth's mark.|$|E
25|$|Activity theory, in {{contrast}} to disengagement theory, implies that the more active elderly people are, {{the more likely they}} are to <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> life. The view that elderly adults should maintain well-being by keeping active has had a considerable history and since 1972, this has come to be known as activity theory. However, this theory may be just as inappropriate as disengagement for some people as the current paradigm on the psychology of ageing is that both disengagement theory and activity theory may be optimal for certain people in old age, depending on both circumstances and personality traits of the individual concerned. There are also data which query whether, as activity theory implies, greater social activity is linked with well-being in adulthood.|$|E

25|$|However, this {{reasoning}} breaks down for four keys {{because there are}} sets of keys w, x, y, and z where none of the four has a byte value {{that it does not}} share with {{at least one of the}} other keys. For instance, if the keys have two bytes each, and w, x, y, and z are the four keys that have either zero or one as their byte values, then each byte value in each position is shared by exactly two of the four keys. For these four keys, the hash values computed by tabulation hashing will always satisfy the equation , whereas for a 4-independent hashing scheme the same equation would only <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> probability 1/m. Therefore, tabulation hashing is not 4-independent.|$|E
25|$|The vagina, {{including}} the vaginal opening, may be altered {{as a result}} of genital modification during vaginoplasty or labiaplasty. Those who undergo vaginoplasty are usually older and have given birth to one or more children. A thorough examination of the vagina before a vaginoplasty is standard, as well as being referred to a urogynecologist for possible vaginal disorders. With regard to labiaplasty, reduction of the labia minora is quick without hindrance, and any complications are rare and can be corrected. The complications are minor enough that those with them may still <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> the procedure. Any scarring from the procedure is minimal, and long-term chronic problems have not been identified. There is no evidence that such surgery improves psychological or relationship problems; however, the surgery has a risk of damaging blood vessels and nerves.|$|E
25|$|Besides all this, Hamilton was a voluminous correspondent. Often {{a single}} letter of Hamilton's {{occupied}} from fifty {{to a hundred}} or more closely written pages, all devoted to the minute consideration of every feature of some particular problem; for {{it was one of}} the peculiar characteristics of Hamilton's mind never to <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> a general understanding of a question; Hamilton pursued the problem until he knew it in all its details. Hamilton was ever courteous and kind in answering applications for assistance in the study of his works, even when his compliance must have cost him much time. He was excessively precise and hard to please with reference to the final polish of his own works for publication; and it was probably for this reason that he published so little compared with the extent of his investigations.|$|E
