5|$|Indonesia was {{the country}} {{hardest hit by}} the Asian {{financial}} crisis of 1997–98. From mid-1997 there were large capital outflows and against the US dollar. Due to poor <b>bank</b> <b>lending</b> practices, many Indonesian companies borrowed cheaper US dollar loans while their income is mainly in Indonesian rupiah. The weakening rupiah spurred panic buying of US dollar by these companies, causing the Indonesian Rupiah to drop in value from a pre-crisis level of Rp. 2,600 to a low point in early 1998 of around Rp. 17,000. Consequently, many companies were bankrupted and the economy shrank by 13.7% leading to sharp increases in unemployment and poverty across the country. Efforts by the central bank to defend the rupiah proved futile and only drained the country's dollar reserves. In exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, between October 1997 and the following April, Suharto signed three letters of intent with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an economic reform process. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantees for bank deposits, and set-up the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to take over management of troubled banks {{in order to prevent}} the collapse of the financial system. Among the steps taken on IMF recommendation, the government raised interest rate up to 70% pa in February 1998 which further worsened the contraction of the economy.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda's {{service sector}} {{suffered}} during the late-2000s recession as <b>bank</b> <b>lending,</b> foreign aid projects and investment were reduced. The sector rebounded in 2010, becoming the country's largest sector by economic output and contributing 43.6% of the country's GDP. Key tertiary contributors include banking and finance, wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transport, storage, communication, insurance, real estate, business services and public administration including education and health. Tourism {{is one of}} the fastest-growing economic resources and became the country's leading foreign exchange earner in 2007. In spite of the genocide's legacy, the country is increasingly perceived internationally as a safe destination. The number of tourist arrivals in 2013 was 864,000 people, up from 504,000 in 2010. Revenue from tourism was US$303million in 2014, up from just US$62million in 2000. The largest contributor to this revenue was mountain gorilla tracking, in the Volcanoes National Park; Rwanda is one of only two countries in which mountain gorillas can be visited safely; the gorillas attract thousands of visitors per year, who are prepared to pay high prices for permits. Other attractions include Nyungwe Forest, home to chimpanzees, Ruwenzori colobus and other primates, the resorts of Lake Kivu, and Akagera, a small savanna reserve in the east of the country.|$|E

40|$|The {{major concern}} {{of this paper}} is to {{determinate}} the causal relation among commercial <b>banks</b> <b>lending</b> and economic performance in a small open economy, Malaysia. Engle-Granger (1987) cointegration and causality methodology were used in analysis. Annual data from 1959 to 1998 reveals a long run relationship among Real Gross Domestic Product (RGDP) and commercial <b>banks</b> <b>lending</b> in aggregate level. The long run elasticity of commercial <b>banks</b> <b>lending</b> on RGDP is 0. 50 and 2. 0 of RGDP on commercial <b>banks</b> <b>lending.</b> The causality analysis shows that the aggregate growth of commercial <b>banks</b> <b>lending</b> has no predictive content for economic growth. A reverse direction of causality was found there are economic growth do 'cause' growth of commercial <b>banks</b> <b>lending.</b> These results therefore imply a remarkable need of commercial banks credit while economic growth is well performed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the efficiency of}} money creation by banks and {{the principles of the}} central bank issuance to improve over it. The ability to issue deposit liability as a means of payment enlarges <b>banks</b> <b>lending</b> capacities and subjects them to fiercer competition. In curcumstances where banks issue too much money, interest-rate policy may help. In circumstances of a credit crunch, quantitative- easing policy helps, under which the central <b>bank</b> <b>lends</b> its issues to all banks. These issues are unbacked by taxation and purely nominal. The optimal quantity of the central <b>bank's</b> <b>lending</b> is unique and implements the first-best allocation...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to reserve requirements, {{there are other}} required financial ratios that affect the amount of loans that a bank can fund. The capital requirement ratio {{is perhaps the most}} important of these other required ratios. When there are no mandatory reserve requirements, which are considered by some economists to restrict lending, the capital requirement ratio acts to prevent an infinite amount of <b>bank</b> <b>lending.</b>|$|E
25|$|Funding {{was granted}} by HM Treasury with the strict {{condition}} {{that the system}} be constructed in phases. Additional taxpayer funding came from the European Regional Development Fund and <b>bank</b> <b>lending.</b> Parliamentary authority to proceed with Phase 1 was obtained with two Acts of Parliament – the Greater Manchester (Light Rapid Transit System) Act 1988 and Greater Manchester (Light Rapid Transit System) (No. 2) Act 1988.|$|E
25|$|Banks {{can create}} new money {{when they make}} a loan. New loans {{throughout}} the banking system generate new deposits elsewhere in the system. The money supply is usually increased by the act of lending, and reduced when loans are repaid faster than new ones are generated. In the United Kingdom between 1997 and 2007, {{there was an increase}} in the money supply, largely caused by much more <b>bank</b> <b>lending,</b> which served to push up property prices and increase private debt. The amount of money in the economy as measured by M4 in the UK went from £750 billion to £1700 billion between 1997 and 2007, much of the increase caused by <b>bank</b> <b>lending.</b> If all the banks increase their lending together, then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in the economy will increase. Excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to default, the banks then become more cautious, so there is less lending and therefore less money so that the economy can go from boom to bust as happened in the UK and many other Western economies after 2007.|$|E
40|$|We {{study how}} changes in {{prudential}} requirements affect cross-border <b>lending</b> of Canadian <b>banks</b> by utilizing an index that aggregates adjustments in key regulatory instruments across jurisdictions. We show {{that when a}} destination country tightens local prudential measures, Canadian <b>banks</b> <b>lend</b> more to that jurisdiction, and the effect is particularly significant when capital requirements are tightened and weaker if <b>banks</b> <b>lend</b> mainly via affiliates. Our evidence also suggests that Canadian <b>banks</b> adjust foreign <b>lending</b> in response to domestic regulatory changes. The results confirm the presence of heterogeneous spillover effects of foreign prudential requirements...|$|R

25|$|Lack {{of access}} to {{financial}} services {{is a serious problem}} {{for the majority of the}} population, particularly in the densely populated rural areas: only 2% of the total population holds bank accounts, and fewer than 0.5% use <b>bank</b> <b>lending</b> services. Microfinance, however, plays a larger role, with 4% of Burundians being members of microfinance institutions – a larger share of the population than that reached by banking and postal services combined. 26 licensed microfinance institutions (MFIs) offer savings, deposits and short- to medium-term credit. Dependence of the sector on donor assistance is limited.|$|E
25|$|The post-2008 Irish {{economic}} downturn, {{coincided with}} a series of banking scandals, followed the 1990s and 2000s Celtic Tiger period of rapid real economic growth fuelled by foreign direct investment, a subsequent property bubble which rendered the real economy uncompetitive, and an expansion in <b>bank</b> <b>lending</b> in the early 2000s. An initial slowdown in economic growth amid the international financial crisis of 2007–08 greatly intensified in late 2008 and the country fell into recession {{for the first time since}} the 1980s. Emigration, as did unemployment (particularly in the construction sector), escalated to levels not seen since that decade.|$|E

25|$|A typical cycle {{begins with}} a {{relaxation}} of central government credit and industrial policy. This allows local governments to push investment aggressively, both through state-sector entities they control directly and by offering investment-promotion incentives to private investors and enterprises outside their jurisdictions. The resulting boom puts upward pressure on prices and may also result in shortages of key inputs such as coal and electricity (as {{was the case in}} 2003). Once inflation has risen to a level at which it begins to threaten social stability, the central government will intervene by tightening enforcement of industrial and credit policy. Projects that went ahead without required approvals will be halted. <b>Bank</b> <b>lending</b> to particular types of investors will be restricted. Credit then becomes tight and investment growth begins to decline.|$|E
500|$|Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE), the {{successor}} to SELNEC, continued to examine possible rail link solutions. Light rail emerged in the early 1980s as a cost-effective option that could make use of existing railway lines and run through the city centre at street level, {{eliminating the need for}} costly tunnelling works. A Rail Study Group, composed of officials from British Rail, GMC and GMPTE formally endorsed the Project Light Rail scheme in 1984. Initial abstract proposals, based on light rail systems in North America and continental Europe, illustrated a draft [...] network consisting of three lines: Altrincham–/, Bury–/ and –. To promote the scheme, GMPTE held a public proof of concept demonstration in March 1987 using a Docklands Light Railway P86 train on a freight-only line adjacent to Debdale Park. The Project Light Rail proposals were presented to the UK Government for taxpayer funding; following route revisions in 1984 and 1987, Project Light Rail was approved. Because of central government's constraints on financial support for innovative transport projects, funding was granted by HM Treasury with the strict condition that the system be constructed in phases. Additional taxpayer funding came from the European Regional Development Fund and <b>bank</b> <b>lending.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Some {{contemporary}} proponents, such as Wray, situate chartalism within post-Keynesian economics, while chartalism {{has been}} proposed as an alternative or complementary theory to monetary circuit theory, both being forms of endogenous money, i.e., money created within the economy, as by government deficit spending or <b>bank</b> <b>lending,</b> rather than from outside, as by gold. In the complementary view, chartalism explains the [...] "vertical" [...] (government-to-private and vice versa) interactions, while circuit theory {{is a model of}} the [...] "horizontal" [...] (private-to-private) interactions.|$|E
2500|$|Alternatively, the Neo-Chartalist view {{asserts that}} the co-op's {{administration}} should resolve the co-op's issues via [...] "fiscal" [...] policy. [...] That is, the scrip system is fiat money, which can be created or destroyed at will by [...] "spending" [...] or [...] "taxation", and the administration should simply inject more scrip into the system when demand is low, and {{reduce the amount of}} scrip when demand is high by increasing scrip fees or charging a levy (a [...] "tax").

2500|$|Jaromir Benes and Michael Kumhof of the IMF Research Department {{report that}} the [...] "deposit multiplier" [...] of the {{undergraduate}} economics textbook, where monetary aggregates are created at the initiative of the central bank, through an initial injection of high-powered money into the banking system that gets multiplied through <b>bank</b> <b>lending,</b> turns the actual operation of the monetary transmission mechanism on its head. Benes and Kumhof assert that in most cases where banks ask for replenishment of depleted reserves, the central bank obliges. Under this view, reserves therefore impose no constraints, as the deposit multiplier is simply, {{in the words of}} Kydland and Prescott (1990), a myth. Under this theory, private banks almost fully control the money creation process.|$|E
