5|$|A {{number of}} health and medical {{research}} advocates, such as the Society for Women's Health Research in the United States, support this broader definition, rather than merely issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological sex differences <b>between</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men</b> exist. Women also need health care more and access {{the health care system}} more than do men. While part of this is due to their reproductive and sexual health needs, they also have more chronic non-reproductive health issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and osteoporosis. Another important perspective is realising that events across the entire life cycle (or life-course), from in utero to aging effect the growth, development and health of women. The life-course perspective {{is one of the key}} strategies of the World Health Organization.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death (30%) amongst women in the United States, and the leading cause of chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary <b>between</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men,</b> including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E
5|$|Research is a {{priority}} in terms of improving women's health. Research needs include diseases unique to women, more serious in women and those that differ in risk factors <b>between</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men.</b> The balance of gender in research studies needs to be balanced appropriately to allow analysis that will detect interactions between gender and other factors. Gronowski and Schindler suggest that scientific journals make documentation of gender a requirement when reporting the results of animal studies, and that funding agencies require justification from investigators for any gender inequity in their grant proposals, giving preference to those that are inclusive. They also suggest it {{is the role of}} health organisations to encourage women to enroll in clinical research. However, there has been progress in terms of large scale studies such as the WHI, and in 2006 the Society for Women's Health Research founded the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD) and the journal Biology of Sex Differences to further the study of sex differences.|$|E

25|$|Adherence {{to strict}} {{dichotomy}} {{between men and}} women: Some eco-feminist critiques are that the dichotomy <b>between</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men</b> and nature and culture creates a dualism that is too stringent and focused in the difference of women and men. That eco-feminism too strongly correlates the social status of women with the social status of nature, rather than the non-essentialist view that women along with nature both have masculine and feminine qualities, and that just like feminine qualities have often been seen as less worthy, nature is also seen as having lesser value than culture, or the qualities involved in these concepts.|$|E
25|$|In 1942, the Egyptian Feminist {{party was}} founded. Headed by Fatma Neamat Rashed, the party called for {{complete}} equality <b>between</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men</b> in education, employment, political representation, and rights. It {{also called for}} the right to paid leave for working women. The Bint El-Nil (daughter of the Nile) was another feminist association created in 1948. Their primary purpose was to claim full political rights for women. It aimed to concentrate on introducing women's participation in the decision-making processes. It also promoted literacy programmes, campaigned to improve health services among the poor, and aimed to enhance mother's rights and childcare.|$|E
25|$|In 1880 Gina Krog {{travelled}} to Great Britain, {{where she}} stayed a {{while at the}} Bedford College, and made contacts with the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies {{and the leader of}} the organization Millicent Garrett Fawcett. Back in Norway she started writing newspaper articles, first under pseudonyms, and later under her own name. She belonged to the radical feminists, demanding full equal political rights <b>between</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men,</b> contrasting the more moderate feminists who focused on the improvement of women's financial conditions. She proclaimed the women's right to vote on equal conditions as men, without compromise. This point of view came to be a disputed issue within the feminist movement of the time.|$|E

25|$|Perceptions of wage {{entitlement}} differ <b>between</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men</b> {{such that}} {{men are more likely}} to feel worthy of higher pay while women's sense of wage entitlement is depressed. Women's beliefs about their relatively lower worth and their depressed wage entitlement reflects their lower social status such that when women's status is raised, their wage entitlement raises as well. However, gender-related status manipulation has no impact on men's elevated wage entitlement. Even when men's status is lowered on a specific task (e.g., by telling them that women typically outperform men on this task), men do not reduce their self-pay and respond with elevated projections of their own competence. The usual pattern whereby men assign themselves more pay than women for comparable work might explain why men tend to initiate negotiations more than women.|$|E

500|$|Women and {{men have}} {{approximately}} equal {{risk of dying}} from cancer, which accounts for {{about a quarter of}} all deaths, and is the second leading cause of death. However the relative incidence of different cancers varies <b>between</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men.</b> In the United States the three commonest types of cancer of women in 2012 were lung, breast and colorectal cancers. [...] In addition other important cancers in women, in order of importance, are ovarian, uterine (including endometrial and cervical cancers (Gronowski and Schindler, Table III). Similar figures were reported in 2016. While cancer death rates rose rapidly during the twentieth century, the increase was less and later in women due to differences in smoking rates. More recently cancer death rates have started to decline as the use of tobacco becomes less common. Between 1991 and 2012, the death rate in women declined by 19% (less than in men). In the early twentieth century death from uterine (uterine body and cervix) cancers was the leading cause of cancer death in women, who had a higher cancer mortality than men. From the 1930s onwards, uterine cancer deaths declined, primarily due to lower death rates from cervical cancer following the availability of the Papanicolaou (Pap) screening test. This resulted in an overall reduction of cancer deaths in women between the 1940s and 1970s, when rising rates of lung cancer led to an overall increase. By the 1950s the decline in uterine cancer left breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death till it was overtaken by lung cancer in the 1980s. All three cancers (lung, breast, uterus) are now declining in cancer death rates (Siegel et al. Figure 8), but more women die from lung cancer every year than from breast, ovarian, and uterine cancers combined. Overall about 20% of people found to have lung cancer are never smokers, yet amongst nonsmoking women the risk of developing lung cancer is three times greater than amongst men who never smoked.|$|E
