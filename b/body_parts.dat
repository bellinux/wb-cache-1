25|$|By type of procedure: Amputation {{involves}} {{cutting off}} a <b>body</b> <b>part,</b> usually a limb or digit; castration {{is also an}} example. Resection is the removal of all of an internal organ or <b>body</b> <b>part,</b> or a key part (lung lobe; liver quadrant) of such an organ or <b>body</b> <b>part</b> that has its own name or code designation. Replantation involves reattaching a severed <b>body</b> <b>part.</b> Reconstructive surgery involves reconstruction of an injured, mutilated, or deformed <b>part</b> of the <b>body.</b> Excision is the cutting out or removal of only part of an organ, tissue, or other <b>body</b> <b>part</b> from the patient. Transplant surgery is the replacement of an organ or <b>body</b> <b>part</b> by insertion of another from different human (or animal) into the patient. Removing an organ or <b>body</b> <b>part</b> from a live human or animal for use in transplant is also a type of surgery.|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} lexicon of <b>body</b> <b>part</b> terms in Jahai, a Mon-Khmer {{language}} spoken {{by a group}} of hunter–gatherers in the Malay Peninsula. It provides an extensive inventory of <b>body</b> <b>part</b> terms and describes their structural and semantic properties. The Jahai <b>body</b> <b>part</b> lexicon pays attention to fine anatomical detail but lacks labels for major, ‘higher-level’ categories, like ‘trunk’, ‘limb’, ‘arm’ and ‘leg’. In this lexicon it is therefore sometimes difficult to discern a clear partonomic hierarchy, a presumed universal of <b>body</b> <b>part</b> terminology...|$|R
40|$|A {{control system}} and method for {{prosthetic}} devices is provided. The control system comprises a transducer for receiving movement from a <b>body</b> <b>part</b> for generating a sensing signal {{associated with that}} movement. The sensing signal is processed by a linearizer for linearizing the sensing signal to be a linear function {{of the magnitude of}} the distance moved by the <b>body</b> <b>part.</b> The linearized sensing signal is normalized to be a function of the entire range of <b>body</b> <b>part</b> movement from the no-shrug position of the movable <b>body</b> <b>part</b> through the full-shrug position of the movable <b>body</b> <b>part.</b> The normalized signal is divided into a plurality of discrete command signals. The discrete command signals are used by typical converter devices which are in operational association with the prosthetic device. The converter device uses the discrete command signals for driving the movable portions of the prosthetic device and its sub-prosthesis. The method for controlling a prosthetic device associated with the present invention comprises the steps of receiving the movement from the <b>body</b> <b>part,</b> generating a sensing signal in association with the movement of the <b>body</b> <b>part,</b> linearizing the sensing signal to be a linear function of the magnitude of the distance moved by the <b>body</b> <b>part,</b> normalizing the linear signal to be a function of the entire range of the <b>body</b> <b>part</b> movement, dividing the normalized signal into a plurality of discrete command signals, and implementing the plurality of discrete command signals for driving the respective movable prosthesis device and its sub-prosthesis...|$|R

5|$|Jarasandha is the nemesis of Krishna. No {{one other}} than Bheema {{or the other}} three {{mentioned}} earlier can defeat him, and the legend is that Krishna escapes to Dwaraka due to threats from Jarasandha, and his repeated failures in defeating the latter. This time Bheema and Krishna go in disguised form, as Brahmins(purohits) into the fortress of Jarasandha. There they request for a duel from Jarasandha. Jarasandha chooses Bheema as his sparring partner. During the fight, Krishna signals Bheema to tear Jarasandha vertically apart into two pieces so the latter will be killed for good. However the <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> of Jarasandha rejoin because of a boon he possesses, and he regains his life. After a few failed attempts, Krishna signals Bheema to throw apart Jarasandha's torn <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> in opposite directions. This time however Jarasandha dies.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores <b>body</b> <b>part</b> {{terms in}} Lavukaleve, a Papuan isolate spoken in the Solomon Islands. The {{full set of}} <b>body</b> <b>part</b> terms {{collected}} so far is presented, and their grammatical properties are explained. It is argued that Lavukaleve <b>body</b> <b>part</b> terms do not enter into partonomic relations with each other, and that a hierarchical structure of <b>body</b> <b>part</b> terms does not apply for Lavukaleve. It is shown too that some universal claims which have been made about the expression of terms relating to limbs are contradicted in Lavukaleve, which has only one general term covering arm, hand, leg and (for some people) foot...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel scale and {{rotation}} invariant method to track a human subject’s <b>body</b> <b>part</b> regions in cluttered videos. The proposed method optimizes {{the assembly of}} <b>body</b> <b>part</b> region proposals with the spatial and temporal constraints of a human body plan. This approach is invariant to the object scale and rotation changes. To enable scale and rotation invariance, the human <b>body</b> <b>part</b> graph of the proposed method has to be loopy; efficiently optimizing the <b>body</b> <b>part</b> region assembly is a great challenge. We propose a dynamic programming method to solve the problem. We devise a method that finds N-best whole body configurations from loopy structures in each video frame using dynamic programming. The N-best configurations are then used to construct trellises with which we track human <b>body</b> <b>part</b> regions by finding shortest paths on the trellises. Our experiments {{on a variety of}} videos show that the proposed method is efficient, accurate and robust against object appearance variations, scale and rotation changes and background clutter. 1...|$|R

40|$|The rubber hand {{illusion}} (RHI) is {{the experience}} of an artificial <b>body</b> <b>part</b> as being a real <b>body</b> <b>part</b> and {{the experience of}} touch coming from that artificial <b>body</b> <b>part.</b> An explanation of this illusion would take significant steps towards explaining the experience of embodiment. I present a new cognitive model to explain the RHI. I argue that the sense of embodiment arises when an online representation of the candidate <b>body</b> <b>part</b> is represented as matching an offline prototype representation of what one's body is usually like. The cause of the sense of embodiment in the model <b>body</b> <b>part</b> only partially overlaps with the causes of proprioceptive drift, which commonly accompanies the RHI, and so is compatible with observed dissociations between the illusion and proprioceptive drift. The distinguishing features of this model are the offline body representation, and the process of matching an online model to an offline model, both of which are to be understood in terms of a conceptual space. 28 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Gross {{movement}} – such as locomotion and {{the movement}} of arms and legs – is generated in the motor cortex, divided into three parts: the primary motor cortex, found in the prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different <b>body</b> <b>parts.</b> These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying anterior to the primary motor cortex: the premotor area and the supplementary motor area. The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other <b>body</b> <b>parts,</b> allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a motor cortical homunculus. Impulses generated from the motor cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves. The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements. Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.|$|E

Initially, Singapore police could only determine that the <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> belonged to a Caucasian, and they had a possible name after receiving a missing person report for Lowe from the South African High Commission.
