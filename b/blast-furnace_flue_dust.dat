40|$|In {{the blast}} furnace process, {{material}} losses {{are caused by}} particles that are blown out of the furnace by the off-gas. In order to reduce these losses, {{it is important to}} understand the correlations between furnace conditions and off-gas dust formation. Off-gas <b>dust,</b> as <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> and sludge, were collected during shaft probe sampling in LKAB Experimental Blast Furnace (EBF). Process data was used to evaluate the relationship between off-gas dust amounts and furnace conditions. The graphitization degree (Lc value) of shaft coke and coke in <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> was determined using XRD measurements. Solution loss in the shaft had a negligible effect on coke degradation and the coke particles which ended up in the <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> were mainly derived from abrasion at low temperatures. The amount of alkali and SiO 2 in sludge increased with higher PCR and flame temperature, which confirmed that submicron spherical particles in sludge originated from the high temperature area around the raceway.

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the physical and chemical characteristics of a <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> sample from a coal fired reverberatory furnace was carried out.

40|$|In Copper Flash Smelting, <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> {{can cause}} severe {{problems}} in the gas handling system, which typically consists of a heat recovery boiler and electrostatic precipitator. If the process is not operated properly, the <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> may form accretions on the boiler wall, reducing boiler heat transfer and subjecting the surfaces to corrosion. <b>Flue</b> <b>dust</b> accretions on heat recovery boiler tube walls have a reducing effect on the heat transfer efficiency of the boiler. No previous data on the thermal conductivity of metallurgical dust accretion layer have been published {{and it is the}} main focus of this work to provide these data. This work also focuses on the physical and chemical characterisation of the accretions and understanding their formation mechanism. The results can be used in the dimensioning of metallurgical heat recovery boilers and they also provide accurate input data for process models. <b>Flue</b> <b>dust</b> accretions, loose process <b>flue</b> <b>dust,</b> and their pure chemical components were characterised and their thermal transportation properties were determined through experimental research. <b>Flue</b> <b>dust</b> particles were found to consist of two layers: oxides of copper and iron in the core of the particles and sulphate layers on the surface. The sulphation reactions take place in the atmosphere of the heat recovery boiler and are believed to participate in the accretion formation mechanisms. Sulphate bridges found between the <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> particles in the accretions suggest that the sulphate phase is the binding component that results in the formation of accretions. Dust accretions consist of several layers possessing varying particle sizes, densities, and thermal properties. The initial deposition of fine particles takes place through thermophoresis or condensation, after which larger particles are able to deposit by sedimentation or inertial impaction. Sufficient time and temperature exposure results in the sintering and condensation of the layer structure and species migration and re-crystallisation, resulting in higher density and thermal conductivity of the layer. The thermal diffusivities and thermal conductivities of <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> accretions, particulate samples of process dust, and pure chemical sulphates were determined. All the samples can be regarded as effective thermal insulators with thermal conductivity values of less than 2 W/mK for fused deposit and less than 0. 7 W/mK for porous samples. The thermal diffusivity values for all samples were less than 0. 005 cm²/s. Thermal diffusivity values show a decreasing temperature dependence, but an increase in the temperature dependence of the specific heat capacities results in slightly increased values for the thermal conductivity of the <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> accretions. The particulate samples show slight decreasing temperature dependence for the thermal conductivity values, which is typical of crystalline structures. All the samples have thermal transportation values of the same order of magnitude and also resemble the values of the literature data on similar fouling layers found in other processes, indicating that chemical composition may not significantly affect the thermal properties of fouling layers.

40|$|Based on 100 % pellets {{operation}} at BF No. 3 at SSAB Tunnplåt in Luleå a new pellet with CaO/SiO 2 = 1 was developed during early nineties. The pellet showed good results in metallurgical laboratory test but caused slag formation {{problems in the}} bosh. A high basicity slag was formed during interaction with basic fluxes and its melting point was increased when the slag was finally reduced. By injection of basic fluxes, the slag formation problems in the bosh can be avoided. Without a sinter plant, dusts have to be recycled in a cold bonded briquette. Injection of some of BF <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> would improve {{the properties of the}} briquette and may be beneficial for the BF process. Based on top charging or tuyere-injection of basic fluxes and the injection of BF <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> studies have been done. The studies carried out will clarify some phenomena of slag formation and the effect of co- injection on coal combustion in the blast furnace, including the effect of: 1) basic fluxes on slag formation in the blast furnace, if they are top- charged; 2) basic fluxes on slag formation in the blast furnace, if they are tuyere injected; 3) chemical composition and metallurgical properties of pellet and fluxes on slag formation; 4) reduction conditions on (reduction temperature, reducing gas composition) on bosh slag formation; 5 co- injection of BOF slag or BF <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> on coal combustion efficiency and BF performance. From the results, it can be concluded that the interaction between pellets and fluxes starts when softening and melting starts in the cohesive layer. By choosing fluxes of a high melting point the dissolution of them in the bosh slag can be delayed and the excessive basicity of the bosh slag can be limited. A basic flux with a low melting point will easily dissolve into the bosh slag causing its basicity to increase, which is beneficial to S refining when acid pellets are used. The formation of a bosh slag of excessive basicity (which causes BF operation disturbances, because its high melting point, increases further during reduction) can be avoided by tuyere injection of basic fluxes with the coal. The positive effect is greatest when a fluxed pellet of basicity B 2  1 and with a high Fe content is used as ferrous burden. In this case, the slag amount can be significantly decreased. BOF slag has suitable high-temperature properties for use as a basic flux in combination with e. g., olivine pellets. It has a low softening and melting temperature, does not shrink, is slowly reduced in the BF shaft and its properties are almost unaffected by the partial reduction occurring in the shaft of the BF. BOF slag absorbs a low content of alkalies, which causes volume increase at elevated temperatures, when the basicity is still high. The results indicate that co-injection of BOF slag or BF <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> with PC has positive effects on the BF operation. The injection of BOF slag decreases the Si content in HM by an increased basicity of the slag formed during combustion leading to a decreased activity of SiO 2 in the slag and by an increased FeO content in the tuyere slag that will be reduced by SiFe in the metal at the tuyere level, if the SiFe is initially high. The consumption of reducing agents can be reduced because of a decreased Si content in HM and a decreased slag amount. The permeability is improved by prohibiting the formation of a shell at the raceway end because of improved melting properties of tuyere slag caused by an increased basicity and FeO content, consumption of coal and coke fines by FeO and improved radial transport of tuyere slag. The injection of BOF slag improves the bosh slag because an excessive basicity caused by top-charged fluxes added for neutralisation of coal and coke ashes and non-uniform slag formation caused by uneven distribution of top-charged fluxes are avoided. The productivity increases because of the possibility to decrease the slag amount. The injection of BOF slag can be done without negative effects on combustion efficiency by using very finely ground BOF slag and because of improved total consumption of coal and coke fines by direct reduction in the coke bed. The injection of BF <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> decreases the Si content in HM by an increased FeO content of the tuyere slag that will be reduced by SiFe in the metal at the tuyere level, if the SiFe is initially high. The consumption of coal and coke is decreased because of a high of C content in BF <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> and the decreased Si content in HM. The permeability is improved by prohibiting the formation of a shell at the raceway end because of consumption of coal and coke fines by FeO and improved melting properties of tuyere slag promoting the radial transport of the tuyere slag.

In this paper, we review the history of technetium research and discuss a new approach to the search for natural technetium associated with tin ores which appears to offer a rare possibility of discovering a smelting operation by-product such as <b>flue</b> <b>dust,</b> in which the volatile technetium heptoxide (Tc{sub 2 }O{sub 7 }), like rhenium heptoxide (Re{sub 2 }O{sub 7 }), would be expected to concentrate. Our concept of a search for technetium in these materials would be {{based on the assumption that}} traces of rhenium could occur in the ore and could be traced most easily by neutron activation of small samples. Such a procedure would confirm that an enrichment from the ore to the <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> actually occurs with the rhenium and therefore should occur with technetium. Furthermore, this occurrence should identify the best location to search for technetium...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{recycling}} or {{disposal of}} <b>flue</b> <b>dusts</b> {{is a continuing}} problem for copper, brass, and bronze smelters. Over 300, 000 short tons (st) of dust is generated annually by U. S. secondary copper, brass, and bronze smelters. The Bureau of Mines has developed an alkaline leach method for recovering metal values from copper converter <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> containing zinc, tin, lead, and copper. The dust was leached with a hot solution of ammonium chloride and ammonium hydroxide to solubilize zno. All of the tin (as sNO 2) and the metallic copper, lead, and zinc, as well as possible insoluble compounds of each, report to the residue. Dissolved copper and lead salts are removed from the leachate by cementation with granular zinc. Zinc oxide is precipitated by diluting the leachate with water. The tin-rich (9. 8 pct) residue has a ready market. The cement product is recyclable to the smelting operation. The zno is at least 97 pct pure and has potential marketability.

5|$|The United States Geological Survey (USGS) {{estimates}} {{that more than}} 1 million tons of gallium is contained in known reserves of bauxite and zinc ores. Some coal <b>flue</b> <b>dusts</b> contain small quantities of gallium, typically less than 1% by weight. However, these amounts are not extractable without mining of the host materials (see below). Thus, the availability of gallium is fundamentally determined by {{the rate at which}} bauxite, zinc ores (and coal) are extracted.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Bioleaching of {{the copper}} <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> emanating from {{smelters}} at Sarcheshmeh Copper Complex has been studied. At the present, the dust is {{sent back to}} the smelter, which reduces its efficiency. In this study, a continuous system including a feed tank and two-stage aerated stirred tank bioreactors was established. Mixed mesophile bacteria with different amounts of the dust containing 35 % of copper mainly in the form of sulfide minerals were used. The effects of pulp densities, residence times and temperatures on the final copper recovery and redox potential were experienced. Despite the copper concentrates bioleaching, the process of dust bio-treating was net acid consuming. Lower pulp densities resulted in a stable redox potential in both reactors. However, increasing the pulp density to 7 %, was created an unstable redox potential in the first bioreactor especially at lower temperatures. Final copper recoveries were calculated for pulp densities of 2 %, 4 % and 7 %, were 91. 8 %, 90. 3 % and 87. 6 % with residence times of 2. 7, 4 and 6 days respectively. The promising results indicated that bioleaching is a feasible process that can be applied to copper <b>flue</b> <b>dusts...</b>|$|R
