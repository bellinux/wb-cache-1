50|$|By year 2000, as the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas {{encouraged}} fewer but bigger {{players in}} the banking industry, the bank initiated its first step towards a three-way merger. By September, the bank acquired Pan Asia Bank. A year after, Bank of Commerce purchased selected assets and liabilities of Trader's Royal <b>Bank</b> <b>paving</b> {{the way for the}} takeover of all the branches thereby expanding the branch network to 112. The Monetary Board also approved in principle the bank's acquisition of Urban Bank, although Urban Bank would later be acquired by Export and Industry Bank.|$|E
50|$|Haiti's economy {{suffered}} a severe setback in January 2010 when a 7.0 magnitude earthquake destroyed {{much of its}} capital city, Port-au-Prince, and neighboring areas. Already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere with 80% of the population living under the poverty line and 54% in abject poverty, the earthquake inflicted $7.8 billion in damage and caused the country's GDP to contract 5.4% in 2010. Following the earthquake, Haiti received $4.59 billion in international pledges for reconstruction, which has proceeded slowly.US economic engagement under the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act, passed in December 2006, has boosted apparel exports and investment by providing duty-free access to the US. Congress voted in 2010 to extend the legislation until 2020 under the HELP Act; the apparel sector accounts for about 90% of Haitian exports and nearly one-tenth of GDP. Remittances are {{the primary source of}} foreign exchange, equaling nearly 20% of GDP and more than twice the earnings from exports. Haiti suffers from a lack of investment, partly because of limited infrastructure and a lack of security. In 2005, Haiti paid its arrears to the World <b>Bank,</b> <b>paving</b> the way for reengagement with the Bank. Haiti received debt forgiveness for over $1 billion through the Highly-Indebted Poor Country initiative in mid-2009. The remainder of its outstanding external debt was cancelled by donor countries following the 2010 earthquake but has since risen to over $600 million. The government relies on formal international economic assistance for fiscal sustainability, with over half of its annual budget coming from outside sources. The Michel Martelly administration in 2011 launched a campaign aimed at drawing foreign investment into Haiti as a means for sustainable development.|$|E

50|$|The {{speedway}} features <b>banked,</b> <b>paved</b> 1/2- and 1/3-mile oval {{tracks and}} a 1/8-mile drag strip. From its opening until 2011 it was primarily used for NASCAR races such as NASCAR K&N Pro Series West and Whelen All-American Series events. In late 2011, NASCAR {{announced it was}} dropping Toyota Speedway from its schedule. The company that manages the track, Irwindale Speedway LLC, filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy on February 13, 2012.|$|R

AJ Foyt at one time held the world record for a half mile oval at the speedway. One of ESPN's first televised auto racing events was held there in 1979.|$|R

The role of Islamic banking is explained with special regards to corporate social responsibility (CSR) as now days this concept is growing vastly.

As {{we live in a}} Muslim country so it is very essential to have some basic knowledge about the Islamic banking. In this paper growth and performance of Islamic banking is discussed and compared among the financial years from 2003 to 2010 in terms of growth parameters like assets, deposits, sources and uses of funds. The performance indicators are also discussed to evaluate the growth and performance of Islamic banking system. In the last eight years, Islamic <b>banking</b> <b>paved</b> with the rapid market share of banking services.

50|$|A 0.25 mi dirt track {{existed at}} the field and it was used {{initially}} for horse racing. In 1955, it was converted to host stock car racing. The track was extended to 0.33 mi, <b>banked</b> and <b>paved</b> in 1957. Successful financially, the stock cars were evicted from the site after lobbying by local residents. Race promoter Gerry Bisson then built a race track west of Ottawa in Stittsville, Ontario (now part of Ottawa) which is today known as Capital City Speedway.|$|R
50|$|In 1990 the 1/2 mile (805 metre) Speedway Super Bowl at {{the eastern}} end of the Bob Jane owned Adelaide International Raceway also saw NASCAR racing, giving the {{category}} the chance to run on both a high banked speedway and a traditional flat short track. The slower Super Bowl was a welcome addition to the series as it offered a new challenge with its short straights and much tighter turns which unlike the 24° banking at the Dome that allowed for high speed, was only 7° at AIR. When compared to the much faster Thunderdome, the Bowl earned the reputation of a bull-ring (NASCAR's lapped the Thunderdome at over 140 mph while lapping Adelaide at around 78 mph). NASCAR continued to run a single round of the series in Adelaide until the series folded in 2001. In 1992, plans were announced by Bob Jane and Channel 7 in Sydney (with help from speedway promoter and Seven's lead motor racing commentator Mike Raymond) to turn the 1/2 mile long trotting track at the Granville Showground that surrounded Sydney's Parramatta Speedway into a <b>banked</b> <b>paved</b> oval, thus giving a third oval track for the series to use. However, the plans never got past the planning stage.|$|R

Further proposed improvements were promised on 13 December 2006, when the Ethiopian government announced that it had secured a loan of US$ 98 million from the African Development <b>Bank</b> to <b>pave</b> the 227 kilometers of highway between Jimma and Mizan Teferi to the southwest.

40|$|The Banking {{system in}} India {{and all over}} the world is based on the {{interest}} system. Interest bearing money is almost like the law of nature where money generates money. However, an alternative banking system called Islamic banking which prohibits charging of interest and is based on profit/loss sharing system became popular in many countries. Global Islamic banking assets attained compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 17 % from 2009 to 2013 according to the World Islamic Banking Competitiveness Report 2014 - 2015. The Indian Banking system has undergone many changes in the recent past with deregulation of <b>banking</b> system <b>paving</b> way for new banks in India. However, Islamic banking which has emerged as a global phenomenon lately has not evolved as a full-fledged system in India though is it operative through the NBFC route.

It weighs the various pros and cons of Islamic banking in India. SWOT analysis and Porter’s Five Forces Model are used to provide a thorough analysis of feasibility and scope of Islamic banking in India. The paper reveals that India has a great potential for Islamic banking provided necessary changes in the regulations and guidelines are made to evolve it has an alternative system of banking. The law makers should view it from an economic point of view rather than a religious view for its successful implementation and for the welfare and upliftment of financially excluded sections of society that do not participate in conventional banking due to their religious beliefs...|$|R
