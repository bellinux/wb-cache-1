25|$|Hemispheric {{asynchrony}} in {{ice sheet}} behavior {{has been observed}} by linking short-term spikes of methane in Greenland ice cores and Antarctic ice cores. During Dansgaard–Oeschger events, the northern hemisphere warmed considerably, dramatically increasing the release of methane from wetlands, that were otherwise tundra during glacial times. This methane quickly distributes evenly across the globe, becoming incorporated in Antarctic and Greenland ice. With this tie, paleoclimatologists have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the ice sheets on Greenland only began to warm after the Antarctic ice sheet had been warming for several thousand years. Why this pattern occurs is still open for debate.|$|E

60|$|The nineteenth century, which prided itself {{upon the}} {{invention}} of steam and evolution, might have derived a more legitimate title to fame from the discovery of pure mathematics.
