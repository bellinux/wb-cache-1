5|$|Mahshi (pl. mahshi) {{dishes are}} {{composed}} of rice stuffed vegetables such as, eggplants, baby pumpkins, potatoes, carrots and marrows {{as well as a}} variety of leaf vegetables, primarily grape leaves, cabbage leaves and less often chard. Mahshi requires delicacy and time—the main reason it is prepared <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> it is cooked and served. Many female family members participate in the rolling and stuffing of the vegetables, relaxing the amount of individual effort required, with great attention to detail.|$|E
5|$|Approval for the mission, codenamed Operation Chariot, {{was given}} on 3 March 1942. Using a French ship would involve using the Free French forces and {{increase}} the number of people aware of the raid. Consequently, it was decided the navy would have to provide a ship of their own. The RAF complained that the raid would draw heavily on their resources; the number of aircraft assigned by RAF Bomber Command was reduced time and time again <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of the raid. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill further complicated matters when he ordered that bombing should only take place if targets were clearly identified.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 June, the Israeli Air Force struck Egyptian air fields, {{destroying}} much of the Egyptian Air Force. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> ended, Israeli armored units had cut through Egyptian defense lines and captured the town of el-Arish. The next day, Amer ordered the immediate withdrawal of Egyptian troops from Sinai—causing the majority of Egyptian casualties during the war. Israel quickly captured Sinai and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.|$|E

5|$|The Igu Aro festival (counting of the year) was a royal festival the eze Nri used to {{maintain}} his influence over the communities under his authority. Each of these communities sent representatives to pay tribute during the ceremony to show their loyalty. At the end the Eze Nri would give the representatives a yam medicine and a blessing of fertility for their communities. The festival {{was seen as a}} day of peace and certain activities were prohibited such as the planting of crops <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of the ceremony, the splitting of wood and unnecessary noise. Igu Aro was a regular event that gave an opportunity for the eze to speak directly to all the communities under him.|$|E
5|$|The Voyage Home was {{the first}} Star Trek film to {{extensively}} film on location—only one day was spent doing so in The Search for Spock. Much of the production was filmed in and around San Francisco during ten days of shooting. The production wanted to film scenes that were readily identifiable as the city. The use of extensive location shooting caused logistical problems; {{a scene in which}} Kirk is nearly run over by an irate cab driver required 12–15cars to be repositioned if the shot was incorrect, taking a half-hour to reshoot. Other scenes were filmed in the city but used sets rather than real locations, such as an Italian restaurant where Taylor and Kirk eat. In the film, the Bird-of-Prey lands cloaked in Golden Gate Park, surprising trashmen who flee the scene in their truck. The production had planned to film in the real park, where they had filmed scenes for The Wrath of Khan, but heavy rains <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of shooting prevented it—the garbage truck would have become bogged down in the mud. Will Rogers Park in western Los Angeles was used instead.|$|E

He returned {{the next day with}} Mohammad Asif and batted with intent to add another 35 runs in five overs. This saw Pakistan avoid the follow-on against England and therefore survive an innings defeat.|$|E

25|$|Gloucestershire {{became the}} first side to concede 500 against the Australians, and {{suffered}} the largest defeat margin thus far on tour, losing by an innings and 222 runs at Ashley Down. After winning the toss and batting, they were bowled out for 155, then conceded 111 against Trumper and Duff <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> was over - Trumper making 83 of those runs. On the second day, Trumper was caught by Jessop for 92, but Hill, Noble and Hopkins all made hundreds, as the Australians totalled 434 in a day. They declared overnight, before bowling Gloucestershire out for 168.|$|E
25|$|This {{message from}} the Lombard king had the desired effect; Christophorus and Sergius began to suspect their associates, who in turn rapidly {{abandoned}} them. Both were reluctant to leave the city, but eventually both {{made their way to}} the Pope during the night.

Negotiations to secure their release were unsuccessful, and <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> was out, Afiarta arrived with his partisans. After discussing the situation with Desiderius, they had both men blinded. Christophorus died after three days, while Sergius was kept in a cell in the Lateran.|$|E

25|$|The MCC {{played a}} one-day warm up match against an up-country South Australian team. W. G. Grace had played here in 1873–74 {{on an open}} space covered with stones, but 97 years later the wicket was 'hard, well-prepared and {{exceptionally}} good'. It was not a limited overs match, each side played one innings and could declare. Peter Lever, Alan Ward, Brian Luckhurst, Don Wilson and John Hampshire dropped six easy catches between them before Hutchinson sportingly declared on 146/9. The openers Geoff Boycott and Brian Luckhurst had no problems making the runs, and as they won <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> was out {{it was agreed that}} they could continue batting in order to practice.|$|E
25|$|Michael Vaughan and Strauss {{scored a}} 142 run second wicket {{partnership}} {{that would prove}} to be crucial in the match. Strauss was dismissed on 96 edging a slider from Anil Kumble. England in a seemingly strong position of 252/2 lost two quick wickets of Michael Vaughan and Paul Collingwood. Vaughan edged an R. P. Singh delivery straight to Dhoni while Paul Collingwood went for his first Test duck being deceived by a googly from Kumble and was trapped lbw reducing England to 255/4. This wicket meant Anil Kumble overtook Shane Warne's Test record of 138 lbw wickets. Ryan Sidebottom joined Kevin Pietersen as nightwatchman and survived 5 deliveries <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> ended with England on 268/4.|$|E

Dewlala, a high-ranking member of Ul'dah's ruling Syndicate, informs the Scions that Teledji Adeledji's conspiracy {{had been discovered}} and thwarted by Lord Lolorito long <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of the Sultana's supposed assassination. Having switched the poison with a sleeping drug, Lolorito allowed the Warrior of Light to scapegoat responsibility for the coup attempt while eliminating Adeledji and the Sultana's plans for democracy simultaneously. Lolorito later personally delivers the antidote to Raubahn and pledges to support the Sultana against the rapidly remobilizing Garlean army.|$|E

25|$|The nose-gear light {{indicators}} {{were designed}} to be fail safe by having two separate light bulbs. This proved to be inadequate, as {{it was impossible to}} look through the cover to check whether one of the bulbs had been compromised, meaning that a failure of one bulb would not be detected until both bulbs malfunctioned. The first bulb was thus presumed to have gone inoperative some time <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of the flight, while the second bulb broke during Flight 933. The NTSB therefore advised the Federal Aviation Administration to articulate means to avoid similar compromised fail-safe designs in the future. Both pilots had minimum-descent altitude light warnings, which were presumed to have given a visual warning, but because of the work overload, neither pilot directed his attention to these alerts.|$|E

25|$|Pope John Paul II {{had laid}} out new {{procedures}} for the election of his successor in his Apostolic Constitution Universi Dominici gregis in 1996. It detailed {{the roles of the}} cardinals and support personnel, the scheduling of the conclave, the text of oaths, penalties for violating secrecy, and many details, even the shape of the ballots ("the ballot paper must be rectangular in shape"). He denied the cardinals the right to choose a pope by acclamation or by assigning the election to a select group of cardinals. He established new voting procedures the cardinals could follow if the balloting continued for several days, but those were not invoked in this conclave. He maintained the rule established by Paul VI that cardinals who reached the age of eighty <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> the pope died would not participate on the balloting.|$|E
