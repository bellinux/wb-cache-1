2500|$|Until January 2008, Benson's {{web site}} also stated: [...] "After serving time {{in federal prison}} for not paying his United States income taxes, Bill Benson still does not pay income taxes and yet our federal {{government}} chooses not to arrest him. Why? Because now he can use this book, which he has written : 'THE LAW THAT NEVER WAS' in his defense."

Why do they do this? <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> cannot win!!" [...] The book was actually published several years before Benson's arrest and, as noted above, Benson himself actually was convicted despite using the defense.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the winter}} of 1996–97 Popović visited Serbia {{for the first time}} since moving to New York City, taking in the months-long protests led by the five-party Zajedno {{coalition}} (that included his ex-wife Vesna Pešić's party, the Civic Alliance) over alleged election theft at the November 1996 municipal elections. In July 1997, amid Zajedno's breakup, Popović observed the anti-Milošević energy of a few months earlier slowly petering out, admonishing the opposition as well as the Serb nation in general for not being courageous enough to condemn the Serbs' leading role in the Bosnian War by stating: [...] "The people are sunk in their passivity <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are guilty, they know the lies they took in – they know they triumphed when Sarajevo was bombed. As a nation they have lost all self-respect." [...] He also claimed that [...] "when Milošević tried to rule the Communist Party (SKJ), he destroyed it, then by creating the war, he destroyed Yugoslavia. Now he's trying to destroy what is left of Yugoslavia." ...|$|E

50|$|The ‘Hawthorne Experiment’ was {{originally}} whether changes in light might affect worker productivity in tests {{carried out at}} the Hawthorne Works, Illinois from 1924 to 1932.

60|$|Such are {{the guests}} {{expected}} {{for those two}} hundred bedrooms. The chance travelers are but chance additions to these, and are not generally the mainstay of the house. As {{a matter of course}} the accommodation for travelers which these hotels afford increases and creates traveling. Men come <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> will be fed and bedded at a moderate cost, and in an easy way, suited to their tastes. With us, and throughout Europe, inquiry is made before an unaccustomed journey is commenced, on that serious question of wayside food and shelter. But in the States no such question is needed. A big hotel is a matter of course, and therefore men travel. Everybody travels in the States. The railways and the hotels between them have so churned up the people that an untraveled man or woman is a rare animal. We are apt to suppose that travelers make roads, and that guests create hotels; but the cause and effect run exactly in the other way. I am almost disposed to think that we should become cannibals if gentlemen's legs and ladies arms were hung up for sale in purveyors' shops.|$|E
60|$|Now it {{is quite}} true that there is less general human {{testimony}} {{to the notion of}} a New Jerusalem in the future than to the notion of a Golden Age in the past. But neither of those ideas, whether or no they are illusions, are any {{answer to the question of}} a plain man in the plain position of this parable; a man who has to find some guidance in the past if he is to get any good in the future. What he positively knows, in any case, is the complete collapse of the present. Now that is the exact truth about the thing so often rebuked as a romantic and unreal return of modern men to medieval things. They suppose they have taken the wrong turning, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are in the wrong place. To know that, it is necessary not to idealise the medieval world, but merely to realise the modern world. It is not so much that they suppose the medieval world was above the average as that they feel sure the modern world is below the average. They do not start either with the idea that man is meant to live in a New Jerusalem of pearl and sapphire in the future, or that a man was meant to live in a picturesque and richly-painted tavern of the past; but with a strong inward and personal persuasion that a man was not meant to live in a man-trap.|$|E
60|$|For {{your own}} sake. If {{you want to}} be respected; if {{you want to be}} {{powerful}}--and it is good to be powerful sometimes--if God has set you to govern people, whether it be your children and household, your own farm, your own shop, your own estate, your own country or neighbourhood--Do you want to know the great secret of success?--Be honest and brave. Let your word be as good as your thought, and your deed as good as your word. Who is the man who is respected? Who is the man who has influence? The complaisant man--the cringing man--the man who cannot say No, or dare not say No? Not he. The passionate man who loses his temper when anything goes wrong, who swears and scolds, and instead of making others do right, himself does wrong, and lowers himself just when he ought to command respect? My experience is--not he: but the man who says honestly and quietly what he thinks, and does fearlessly and quietly what he knows. People who differ from him will respect him, because he acts up to his principles. When they are in difficulty or trouble, they will go and ask his advice, just <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> will get an honest answer. They will overlook a little roughness in him; they will excuse his speaking unpleasant truths: because they can trust him, even though he is plain-spoken.|$|E
50|$|After Anwar plays a victim, he cannot continue.

60|$|Not all days, {{and only}} on rare days, is the surf heavy at Waikiki; and, {{in the days}} that followed, Ida and Lee Barton, much in {{evidence}} on the beach and in the water, continued to arouse disparaging interest in the breasts of the tourist ladies, although the Outrigger captains ceased from worrying about them in the water. They would watch the pair swim out and disappear in the blue distance, and they might, or might not, chance to see them return hours afterward.

60|$|The {{problem of}} the snow proved indeed the text for a tale {{touching}} the practical politics of the city. The English soldiers cleared the snow away; the Arabs sat down satisfied or stoical with the snow blocking their own doors or loading their own roofs. But the Jews, as the story went, were at length persuaded to clear away the snow in front of them, and then demanded a handsome salary for having recovered {{the use of their}} own front doors. The story is not quite fair; and yet it is not so unfair as it seems. Any rational Anti-Semite will agree that such tales, even when they are true, do not always signify an avaricious tradition in Semitism, but sometimes the healthier and more human suggestion of Bolshevism. The Jews do demand high wages, but it is not always because they are in the old sense money-grabbers, but rather in the new sense money-grabbers (as an enemy would put it) men sincerely and bitterly convinced of their right to the surplus of capitalism. There is the same problem in the Jewish colonies in the country districts; in the Jewish explanation of the employment of Arab and Syrian labour. The Jews argue that this occurs, not because they wish to remain idle capitalists, but because they insist on being properly paid proletarians. With all this I shall deal, however, when I treat of the Jewish problem itself. The point for the moment is that the episode of the snow did in a superficial way suggest the parts played by the three parties and the tales told about them. To begin with, it is right to say that the English do a great many things, as they clear away the snow, simply because nobody else would do them. They did save the oriental inhabitants from some of the worst consequences of the calamity. Probably they sometimes save the inhabitants from something which the inhabitants do not regard as a calamity. It is the danger of all such foreign efficiency that it often saves men who {{do not want to be}} saved. But they do in many cases do things from which Moslems profit, but which Moslems by themselves would not propose, let alone perform. And this has a general significance even in our first survey, for it suggests a truth easy to abuse, but I think impossible to ignore. I mean that there is something non-political about Moslem morality. Perverse as it may appear, I suspect that most of their political movements result from their non-political morality. They become politicians <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are not political; and feel their simple and more or less healthy life is at a disadvantage, in face of the political supremacy of the English and the political subtlety of the Jews.|$|E
