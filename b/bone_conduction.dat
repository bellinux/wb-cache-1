5|$|The {{cetaceans}} (whales, dolphins and porpoises) are {{marine mammal}} descendants of land mammals. The pakicetids are an extinct family of hoofed mammals {{that are the}} earliest whales, whose closest sister group is Indohyus from family Raoellidae. They lived in the Early Eocene, around 53 million years ago. Their fossils were first discovered in North Pakistan in 1979, at a river {{not far from the}} shores of the former Tethys Sea. Pakicetids could hear under water, using enhanced <b>bone</b> <b>conduction,</b> rather than depending on tympanic membranes like most land mammals. This arrangement does not give directional hearing under water.|$|E

50|$|Cartilage {{conduction}} is {{a pathway}} in which sound signals are {{transmitted to the}} inner ear. This pathway is distinct from conventional sound pathways such as air or <b>bone.</b> Therefore, cartilage <b>conduction</b> it {{referred to as the}} third auditory pathway.|$|R
25|$|Unlike the <b>bone</b> <b>conduction</b> {{spectacles}} {{the sound}} is transmitted via hearing aids which {{are attached to the}} arm or arms of the spectacles. When removing your glasses for cleaning, the hearing aids are detached at the same time. Whilst there are genuine instances where spectacle aids are a preferred choice, they may not always be the most practical option.|$|E
25|$|Sounds are {{transmitted}} via a receiver attached from {{the arm of}} the spectacles which are fitted firmly behind the boney portion of the skull {{at the back of the}} ear, (mastoid process) by means of pressure, applied on {{the arm of the}} spectacles. The sound is passed from the receiver on the arm of the spectacles to the inner ear (cochlea), via the bony portion. The process of transmitting the sound through the bone requires a great amount of power. <b>Bone</b> <b>conduction</b> aids generally have a poorer high pitch response and are therefore best used for conductive hearing losses or where it is impractical to fit standard hearing aids.|$|E
500|$|Since {{infrasonic}} bass is felt, sub-bass can be augmented using tactile transducers. Unlike {{a typical}} subwoofer driver, which produces audible vibrations, tactile transducers produce low-frequency vibrations {{that are designed}} to be felt by individuals who are touching the transducer or indirectly through a piece of furniture or a wooden floor. Tactile transducers have recently emerged as a device class, called variously [...] "bass shakers", [...] "butt shakers" [...] and [...] "throne shakers". They are attached to a seat, for instance a drummer's stool ("throne") or gamer's chair, car seat or home theater seating, and the vibrations of the driver are transmitted to the body then to the ear {{in a manner similar to}} <b>bone</b> <b>conduction.</b> They connect to an amplifier like a normal subwoofer. They can be attached to a large flat surface (for instance a floor or platform) to create a large low frequency conduction area, although the transmission of low frequencies through the feet is not as efficient as the seat.|$|E
40|$|Several {{conditions}} in Orthopaedics and Traumatology {{are characterized by}} a bone loss. Bone auto- or allo-grafting was considered sufficient to fullfill the defects decades ago; however, large bone defects were challenging for the Surgeons, particularly in case of necessity of structural and biological properties. Bioindusrty proposed over the years synthetic biomaterials, as Demineralized Bone Matrix, bioactive surfaces for implant coponents, and recently recombinant Bone Morphogenetic Proteins. At the same time, {{the concept of the}} “biological chamber” and “diamond concept” allowed the scientific community to consider the need of a more complex interaction between scaffolds (matrix), cells (mesenchymal cells), and signaling (growth factors) in order to induce bone regeneration and also to fill small or large bone defects. A brief overview is made on the processes of a physiologic <b>bone</b> metabolism (induction, <b>conduction,</b> osteogenesis), on the latest therapeutical procedures, based on the use of autologous growth factors and cells, and the recent prosthetic or synthetic scaffolds, and the common clinical conditions that may beneficiate of these modern approache...|$|R
30|$|Baseline {{pure tone}} audiograms between 250 and 16, 000  Hz will be {{performed}} for all the patients using a KUDU wave audiometer (Geoaxon, Pretoria, South Africa). This is a portable device run by an eMoyo algorithm on a laptop and it obviates {{the need for a}} sound proof booth (Swanepoel et al. 2010). The audiometer uses external audio cups to attenuate environmental noise and intra-aural probe and fore head vibrator to deliver the pure tones. It also monitors ambient sound via an inbuilt microphone and the test is stopped once the environmental sound becomes loud enough to interfere with the examination. A user friendly game pad is also attached to the laptop and user is instructed to press the keys after perceiving the pure tones. This enables the software to plot the user responses directly on an audiogram. The software also prompts the examiner to position the forehead vibrator after completion of the air conduction tests; at the end of both the <b>bone</b> and air <b>conduction</b> test the pure tone average is automatically calculated and a printer friendly audiogram is generated.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the ratio of hearing loss {{evaluated}} with transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAEs) testing in normal and hypertensive pregnant women during the first week after delivery. This was a prospective, case-control study. The hypertensive pregnancy group included 96 women with gestational hypertension preeclampsia, eclampsia, or HELLP syndrome, while the normal pregnancy group included age-matched 107 women with normal pregnancy. Postpartum first week, pure tone hearing threshold levels of all women were measured at 0. 25, 1, 2, 4 and 6 kHz. TEOAEs testing results were also recorded. All subjects also underwent a detailed ear noise and throat examination. Hearing loss with TEOAE during the first postpartum week was detected in seven (7. 3 %) women in the hypertensive pregnancy group and in three (2. 8 %) women in normal pregnancy group. Mean hearing thresholds and individual thresholds at each of the examined frequencies (0. 25 - 6 kHz) were similar in the two groups. <b>Bone</b> and air <b>conduction</b> pure tone average and TEOAE results were not statistically significantly different in the hypertensive pregnancy and normal pregnancy groups.

500|$|Water has {{different}} acoustic properties {{from those of}} air. Sound from an underwater source can propagate relatively freely through body tissues where there is contact with the water as the acoustic properties are similar. When the head is exposed to the water, some sound is transmitted by the eardrum and middle ear, but a significant part reaches the cochlea independently, by <b>bone</b> <b>conduction.</b> Some sound localisation is possible, though difficult. [...] Human hearing underwater, {{in cases where the}} diver’s ear is wet, is less sensitive than in air. Frequency sensitivity underwater also differs from that in air, with a consistently higher threshold of hearing underwater; sensitivity to higher frequency sounds is reduced the most. [...] The type of headgear affects noise sensitivity and noise hazard depending on whether transmission is wet or dry. Human hearing underwater is less sensitive with wet ears than in air, and a neoprene hood causes substantial attenuation. When wearing a helmet, hearing sensitivity is similar to that in surface air, as it is not greatly affected by the breathing gas or chamber atmosphere composition or pressure. Because sound travels faster in heliox than in air, voice formants are raised, making divers' speech high-pitched and distorted, and hard to understand for people not used to it. The increased density of breathing gases under pressure has a similar and additive effect.|$|E
2500|$|A bone {{anchored}} {{hearing aid}} (BAHA) is an auditory prosthetic based on <b>bone</b> <b>conduction</b> {{which can be}} surgically implanted. It is an option for patients without external ear canals, when conventional hearing aids with a mould in the ear cannot be used. The BAHA uses the skull as a pathway for sound {{to travel to the}} inner ear. [...] For people with conductive hearing loss, the BAHA bypasses the external auditory canal and middle ear, stimulating the functioning cochlea. [...] For people with unilateral hearing loss, the BAHA uses the skull to conduct the sound from the deaf side to the side with the functioning cochlea.|$|E
2500|$|Magnetostriction headphones, {{sometimes}} {{sold under}} {{the label of}} [...] "Bonephones", are headphones that work via the transmission of vibrations {{against the side of}} head, transmitting the sound via <b>bone</b> <b>conduction.</b> This is particularly helpful in situations where the ears must be left unobstructed or when used by those who are deaf for reasons which do not affect the nervous apparatus of hearing. Magnetostriction headphones though, have greater limitations to their fidelity than conventional headphones which work via the normal workings of the ear. Additionally, there was also one attempt to market a plasma-ionisation headphone in the early 1990s by a French company called Plasmasonics. It is believed that there are no functioning examples left.|$|E

40|$|This aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to examine the}} {{auditory}} anatomy of odontocetes, with a particular focus on Cuvier’s beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris) to determine if there are any anatomical features unique to this species that may be of functional significance. Cuvier’s beaked whale was the prime species of interest in this study given the over representation of this species at atypical stranding events {{associated with the use of}} naval sonar. Features traditionally described in odontocete sound reception and anatomical features that are involved with cochlear stimulation via bone conducted vibrations in terrestrial mammals were examined with computed and micro-computed tomography. The morphology of the Z. cavirostris varied from other odontocetes examined, with a decrease in the size of the tympanic plate and medial sulcus of the mallear ridge. Given the role credited to these structures in odontocete sound conduction, this diminution may decrease the efficiency at which vibrations are transferred via these structures. There was also an increased degree of osseous contact between the tympanoperiotic complex and the skull and an increase in the diameter, and decreased impedance, of the cochlear aqueduct. These features may increase the sensitivity of the cochlea of Z. cavirostris to stimulation via bone conducted vibrations via the direct transfer of cranial vibrations to the periotic <b>bone</b> and the <b>conduction</b> of audio-frequency pressure waves from the cerebrospinal fluid to the cochlea via the cochlear aqueduct. The simultaneous presence and phase differences of these routes of BCV may provide a supra sensitivity to cochlear stimulation at low and mid frequencies and create an interaural intensity difference that may form the basis for an exciting novel hypothesis to explain directional hearing via bone conducted vibrations...|$|R
40|$|The {{resistivity}} of bone is {{the most}} variable of all the tissues in the human body, ranging from 312 U cm to 84, 745 U cm. Volume conduction models of cochlear implants have generally used a resistivity value of 641 U cm for the bone surrounding the cochlea. This study investigated the effect that bone resistivity has on modelled neural thresholds and intracochlear potentials using user-specific volume conduction models of implanted cochleae applying monopolar stimulation. The complexity of {{the description of the}} head volume enveloping the cochlea was varied between a simple infinite bone volume and a detailed skull containing a brain volume, scalp and accurate return electrode position. It was found that, depending on the structure of the head model and implementation of the return electrode, different bone resistivity values are necessary to match model predictions to data from literature. Modelled forward-masked spatial tuning curve (fmSTC) widths and slopes and intracochlear electric field profile length constants were obtained for a range of bone resistivity values for the various head models. The predictions were compared to measurements found in literature. It was concluded that, depending on the head model, a bone resistivity value between 3500 U cm and 10, 500 U cm allows prediction of neural and electrical responses that match measured data. A general recommendation is made to use a resistivity value of approximately 10, 000 U cm for <b>bone</b> volumes in <b>conduction</b> models of the implanted cochlea when neural excitation is predicted and a value of approximately 6500 U cm when predicting electric fields inside the cochlear duct.

Means of hearing loss thresholds for 250 Hz – 4 kHz were established and compared between groups of right vs. left ears of tested vs. control ears according to age subgroups: 1 – 3 yr, 4 – 6 yr, 7 – 9 yr, 10 – 12 yr, 13 – 15 yr. At age 1 – 3 yr otitis media with effusion children showed no ear side difference in hearing loss. Age groups of 4 – 6 and 7 – 9 yr otitis media with effusion children showed left ears with higher threshold of hearing loss across all of the tested frequencies than right ears in study and control ears. Right ears showed smaller hearing loss in study and control group and no age group predicted for hearing impairment. Higher hearing loss threshold for 4 kHz in adolescence in otitis media with effusion ears is early sign of sequels after repetitive episodes of middle ear effusion. Control groups showed no ear side or age group dependent difference of hearing loss threshold.

World Data standard treatment for patients is a combined approach, one of the stages is a surgical treatment. In modern oncoorthopedics the standard of surgical treatment of patients with tumor lesions of <b>bone</b> is the <b>conduction</b> of segmental <b>bone</b> resection and oncological arthroplasty. However, just as with other surgical interventions, in arthroplasty with large joints that is associated with the introduction of foreign material into the body, there are complications which usually are infectious by nature. Complications associated with the continuous use of immunosuppressive therapy include bacterial and viral infections. It must be emphasized that in the context of immunosuppression bacterial infection is much greater and is accompanied by greater mortality than in patients without immunosuppression. The frequency of complications in patients who undergo total joint replacement after organ transplantation can be significantly reduced by the correction of metabolic disorders, the purpose of broad-spectrum antibiotics in the perioperative period and careful rehabilitation. It is necessary to work closely with the transplantologists. Also the method of using a local antibiotic administered directly to the site of surgery can be used. This method has significant advantages because of the high local concentrations with minimal risk of systemic toxicity.
