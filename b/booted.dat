5|$|The plain {{appearance}} of the garden warbler means {{that it can be}} confused with several other species. The melodious and icterine warblers usually have long bills and a yellowish tint to their plumage. The <b>booted</b> warbler is similar in colour, although it is smaller, more delicately built and has a flesh-coloured bill. Western and eastern olivaceous warblers are also relatively small, and have white outer tail feathers as well as a pinkish bill. Juvenile barred warblers, which lack the obvious barring of adults, are much larger than garden warblers and have a pale double wingbar.|$|E
5|$|Zerfoss {{entered the}} game with an injury. Curry ran for 80 yards to score a {{touchdown}} on a fumbled punt. Cody <b>booted</b> a 20-yard field goal for the only other Commodores' score. Vanderbilt could only manage five first downs in the contest. The starting lineup was Adams (left end), Lipscomb (left tackle), Putnam (left guard), Reyer (center), Williams (right guard), Cody (right tackle), Cohen (right end), Curry (quarterback), Floyd (left halfback), Zerfoss (right halfback), and Wiggs (fullback).|$|E
5|$|Georgia's kicking {{game had}} {{a far more}} active day than its offense. Punter Gordon Ely-Kelso <b>booted</b> sevenpunts and kicker Brandon Coutu nailed threefieldgoals. The field goals, kicked from 39,51,and28yards away and two extra points made Coutu Georgia's leading scorer in the game, earning 11points. Ely-Kelso netted 264yards in punts, an average of 37.7yards per kick. Though not long, the punts were high enough {{in the air to}} allow Georgia's special teams to get downfield and prevent long punt returns. Only two of Ely-Kelso's punts were {{returned}} by Tech kick returner Eddie Royal, and one return was for negative yardage.|$|E

Other terms for this {{footwear}} include over-the-knee <b>boots</b> (abbreviated OTK boots; the full term {{is also used}} for the 15th century riding <b>boots</b> for men, later adopted by women) and, especially when cuffed, pirate <b>boots.</b> Lengths vary from reaching just over the knee to reaching almost to the crotch (referred to as crotch <b>boots</b> or crotch-high <b>boots).</b>|$|R
5|$|Herrerasaurus {{displays}} {{traits that}} are found in different groups of dinosaurs, and several traits found in non-dinosaurian archosaurs. Although it shares most {{of the characteristics of}} dinosaurs, there are a few differences, particularly in the shape of its hip and leg bones. Its pelvis is like that of saurischian dinosaurs, but it has a bony acetabulum (where the femur meets the pelvis) that was only partially open. The ilium, the main hip bone, is supported by only two sacrals, a basal trait. However, the pubis points backwards, a derived trait as seen in dromaeosaurids and birds. Additionally, the end of the pubis has a <b>booted</b> shape, like those in avetheropods; and the vertebral centra has an hourglass shape as found in Allosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The 1941 VFL season {{went ahead}} despite {{the loss of}} many players to {{military}} service. Miller alternated between playing in the backline and in attack depending on match conditions. When St Kilda were kicking downwind, Miller would play in attack, and when they kicked against the wind, {{he would return to}} a defensive position. In the forward line, he alternated with Sam Loxton, a future Invincibles teammate. He <b>booted</b> 28 goals in 16 games, including eight in one match against North Melbourne. Miller also gained a reputation among opponents for kicking them in the ankles. He again showed his disrespect for authority and reputation. In one match against Melbourne, for whom his boss and state cricket teammate Percy Beames played, Miller charged towards Beames with a raised elbow {{at the start of the}} match, forcing his boss to be taken from the field. Miller came second in St Kilda's best and fairest for 1941 as his team again came second to last.|$|E
5|$|The Browns' first {{opponents in}} the 1986 playoffs were the New York Jets. The Jets were ahead {{for most of the}} game and held a 20–10 lead as time wound down in the final quarter. But Cleveland took over and began a march down the field, ending with a Kevin Mack touchdown. The defense forced the Jets to punt after the ensuing kickoff, leaving the offense with less than a minute to get within field goal range and even the score at 20–20. A pass {{interference}} penalty and a completion to Slaughter put the ball at the Jets' five-yard line, and kicker Mark Moseley <b>booted</b> through the tying score with 11 seconds left. In an initial 15-minute overtime period, Moseley missed a short field goal and neither team scored, sending the game into double overtime. This time, Moseley made a field goal and won the game for the Browns 23–20. It was the team's first playoff victory in 17 years.|$|E

5000|$|Bovver <b>boots,</b> Doc Martens <b>boots</b> {{and army}} <b>boots</b> were adopted by skinheads and punks {{as part of}} their typical dress and have {{migrated}} to more mainstream fashion, including women's wear. As a more rugged alternative to dress shoes, dress <b>boots</b> may be worn (though these can be more formal than shoes). Fashionable <b>boots</b> for women may exhibit all the variations seen in other fashion footwear: tapered or spike heels, platform soles, pointed toes, zipper closures and the like. The popularity of <b>boots</b> as fashion footwear ebbs and flows. Singer Nancy Sinatra popularized the fad of women wearing <b>boots</b> in the late 1960s with her song [...] "These <b>boots</b> are made for walking". They were popular in the 1960s and 1970s (particularly knee-high <b>boots),</b> but diminished in popularity {{towards the end of the}} 20th century. In the 2010s, they are experiencing a resurgence in popularity, especially designs with a long bootleg. <b>Boot</b> bolos, <b>boot</b> bracelets, <b>boot</b> straps, <b>boot</b> chains, and <b>boot</b> harnesses are used to decorate <b>boots.</b> Sandal <b>boots</b> also exist.|$|R
5|$|The Giants hired former Arizona Cardinals {{offensive}} coordinator Jim Fassel as their head coach before the 1997 season. With the team's offense floundering {{once again and}} a 2–3 record after five games, Fassel turned to inexperienced Danny Kanell as the starting quarterback over Dave Brown. The Giants experienced a resurgent season, finishing 10–5–1 and winning the NFC East. They hosted a first–round playoff game against the Minnesota Vikings. The Giants led the Vikings {{for most of the}} game, including 22–13 in the 4th quarter, but following a muffed onside kick, the Vikings <b>booted</b> a last-second field goal to win 23–22. Following the season, George Young left the Giants. He was replaced by Ernie Accorsi, a veteran general manager who had successful stints building the Baltimore Colts and Cleveland Browns.|$|E
5|$|As a pinch hitter, Caballero {{came through}} with hits in clutch situations, notably against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 30. Behind 6–3 at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis, the Phillies sent Caballero {{to the plate}} to pinch hit {{in the top of}} the seventh inning. He led off the inning with a single, scoring the first run of a seesaw come-from-behind rally that ended with a 9–8 Phillies victory, closer Jim Konstanty's 13th of the season. Caballero {{displayed}} his running skills again in September, replacing Goliat in the ninth inning of another game against the Cardinals, and scoring a late-inning run in place of Lopata against the Cincinnati Reds several days later to tie a close game that the Phillies eventually lost in 18 innings. On September 26, Caballero scored another crucial run against the Boston Braves when he pinch-ran for outfielder Dick Sisler. Waiting on third base after advancing from first on a Del Ennis single to center field, Jones hit a high ground ball to Boston shortstop Sibby Sisti, who <b>booted</b> the ball and allowed Caballero to score the game-tying run; the Phillies won, 8–7.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland next {{faced the}} Yankees {{at home in}} a rematch of the {{previous}} year's title game. The crowd of 80,067 was the second-largest in professional football history at the time. More people were turned away at the gates because Cleveland Stadium was filled to capacity. New York scored first in the first quarter on a 47-yard field goal by Harvey Johnson, but Cleveland came back in the second quarter, putting up 17 points to lead 17–3 at halftime. New York came back and tied the game 17–17 in the third quarter. Graham responded with a touchdown throw to Speedie in the third quarter. The Yankees threatened a comeback in the final minutes when Lou Sossman blocked a Groza field goal try and New York recovered, advancing the ball to Cleveland's 25-yard line. Cleveland, however, took over on downs and ran down the clock to three minutes with a series of running plays, reaching New York's 35-yard line. Groza then attempted a field goal that fell short, but the Yankees were called offside, and Groza successfully <b>booted</b> his next try through, giving Cleveland a 26–17 victory. The Browns had 14 first downs to New York's 11 and rushed for 212 yards, compared to 111 for the Yankees. Graham had 11 completions for 161 passing yards despite being sacked five times for 72 yards of losses.|$|E

5|$|The Ravens' first regular-season {{win over}} the Patriots came on September 23, 2012. The game was {{emotional}} as receiver Torrey Smith was competing {{following the death of}} his brother in a motorcycle accident just the night before. Smith caught two touchdowns in a back and forth game; the Ravens erased a 13–0 lead {{in the first half and}} led 14–13, but the Patriots scored at the end of the second quarter for a 20–14 lead. The lead changed twice in the third quarter and the Patriots led 30–21 in the fourth, but the Ravens scored on Smith's second touchdown catch. The Ravens were stopped on fourth down but the Patriots had to punt; in the final two minutes a pass interference penalty on Devin McCourty put the ball at the Patriots 7-yard line; new Ravens kicker Justin Tucker <b>booted</b> a 27-yard field goal on the final play; the ball sailed directly over the upright and was ruled good; the quality of officiating by replacement referees caused controversy as Bill Belichick angrily reached for one of the referees as they were leaving the field, leading to a $50,000 fine later that week.|$|E
25|$|Standard Live USBs {{cannot be}} used on Intel Macs; the EFI {{firmware}} can recognize and boot from USB drives, but it can only do this in EFI mode–when the firmware switches to BIOS mode, it no longer recognizes USB drives, {{due to lack of}} a BIOS-mode USB driver. Many operating systems, such as earlier versions of Windows and Linux, can only be <b>booted</b> in BIOS mode, or are more easily <b>booted</b> or perform better when <b>booted</b> in BIOS mode, and thus USB booting on Intel-based Macs was for a time largely limited to Mac OS X, which can easily be <b>booted</b> via EFI.|$|E

50|$|High-heeled <b>boots</b> help to {{elongate}} the calf, {{creating a}} longer-legged appearance {{which is generally}} considered to be more sexually attractive.
