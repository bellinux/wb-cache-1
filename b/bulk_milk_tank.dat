Univariable regression was used to look for associations between fluke exposure and production-related variables including milk yield, composition, somatic cell count and calving index. Although causation cannot be assumed, a significant (p< 0. 001) negative association was seen between F. hepatica exposure and estimated milk yield at the herd level, representing a 15 % decrease in yield for an increase in F. hepatica exposure from the 25 th to the 75 th percentile.

40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} is {{an ongoing}} problem in Ireland, and herd incidence has remained at approximately 5 % for some years. Spillover of infection from cattle to people remains an ever-present possibility, given the ongoing pool of infection in the Irish cattle population. This paper describes an outbreak of tuberculosis affecting cattle and people on a dairy farm in southeastern Ireland following the consumption of milk from a seven-year-old cow with tuberculous mastitis. Twenty-five of 28 calves born during autumn 2004 and spring 2005 were subsequently identified as TB reactors, and five of six family members were positive on the Mantoux test. During 2005, milk from this cow had mainly been used to feed calves, and was added only occasionally to the bulk tank. Therefore, the calves each received infected milk on an almost continuous basis between birth and weaning. The family collected milk from the <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> <b>tank,</b> and consumed it without pasteurisation. This case highlights {{the risks associated with}} the consumption of raw milk.

40|$|Dairy farmers {{suffered}} substantially increased {{energy bills}} during the 1970 's, {{at a time}} of herd expansion and modernisation of equipment to allow bulk milk refrigeration and storage on the farm. Little was known of the levels of electricity use in the dairy farming sector, but extrapolations had suggested a figure of 300 to over 400 kWh/cow/annum. Farmers were requesting quantitative estimates for the potential of conservation equipment, particularly plate heat exchangers and heat recovery units. An energy audit of dairy farms in South Devon is described. Over a period of two years, data were collected relating to energy use by each of the major components of a milking parlour and dairy, for a range of parlour sizes, levels of production and the ambient conditions. Analysis revealed the factors most influencing variations in energy use. An equation was developed to describe the energy use by a <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> <b>tank,</b> given the level of production and the ambient temperature. The bulk tank accounted for some 40 % of the total energy used. The bulk tank has been studied in detail. The stages of heat transfer from the milk to the chilled water and the resulting effects upon the ice bank have been modelled. Laboratory investigations were carried out to determine some parameters empirically. The model's limits, sensitivity and validation are reported. Typical levels and ranges of energy use are suggested. A mean of approximately 250 kWh/cow/annum resulted from the audit, but 200 kWh/cow/annum was achieved by the most economical of farms without resort to conservation equipment, and this level is proposed as a target for the conscientious farmer. The factors affecting energy use in the farm dairy are identified as political, environmental, technical and managerial and these are discussed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is a {{recently}} emerged virus of ruminants in Europe. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) {{are commonly used}} to detect SBV-specific antibodies in <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> samples to monitor herd exposure to infection. However, it has previously been shown that a <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> sample can test positive even though the majority of cows within the herd are seronegative for SBV antibodies. Development of a pen-side test to detect antibodies in individual milk samples would potentially provide a cheaper test (for which samples are obtained non-invasively) than testing individual serum samples by ELISA. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the agreement between antibody levels measured in milk and serum. RESULTS: Corresponding milk and serum samples from 88 cows in two dairy herds in the UK were tested for presence of immunoglobulin G antibodies to SBV using a commercially-available indirect ELISA. A serum neutralisation test (NT) was also performed as a gold standard assay. The ELISA values obtained for the <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> samples corresponded with the mean values for individual milk samples from each herd (<b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> values were 58...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine on-farm risk factors for bacteriological quality of <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk.</b> <b>Bulk</b> <b>tank</b> raw <b>milk</b> quality was evaluated on all Prince Edward Island dairy herds (n= 235) over a 2 -yr period (March 2005 to March 2007). Biweekly total bacterial, preliminary incubation, laboratory pasteurization, and coliform counts were conducted using a Petrifilm culture system. For the assessment of risk factors, a case-control study was conducted from January 2006 to May 2007. Case and control herds were defined based on the last 6 analyses of bulk tank bacterial counts before on-farm evaluation. Cases were herds that had multiple elevated counts for any of the parameters measured. A total of 69 herds (39 cases and 30 control herds) were evaluated. Data collection included (1) observation and questionnaire on basic hygiene and farm management practices; (2) complete wash analysis of the milking equipment, monitoring the presence of bacterial films on equipment and evaluation of cooling system function; and (3) environmental and cow hygiene scoring. Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. The results of the final model indicated that high alkalinity in the wash water and poor teat-end cleanliness were associated with high bacterial counts in <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> (odds ratios= 12 and 5. 3, respectively). It was also observed that high water temperature of detergent wash and the use of a water softener were associated with low bacterial counts in <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> (odds ratios= 0. 87 and 0. 11, respectively). A significant association between udder hair clipping and teat-end cleanliness was also observed. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of udder hygiene and milking system washing factors on hygienic quality of <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk...</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{implement}} {{appropriate and}} effective disease control {{programs at the}} national level, up-to-date and unbiased information on disease frequency is needed. The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the prevalence of selected endemic infectious diseases in the population of dairy herds in Great Britain. <b>Bulk</b> <b>milk</b> <b>tank</b> (BMT) samples from 225 randomly selected dairy farms, stratified by region and herd size, were tested for antibodies against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine herpesvirus type 1, Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, Leptospira Hardjo, Salmonella spp., Coxiella burnetii, Fasciola hepatica, Neospora caninum, and Ostertagia ostertagi. Furthermore, the presence of BVDV, C. burnetii, and Chlamydia-like organisms was determined by PCR. The apparent herd prevalence was estimated as a weighted proportion of positive herds. The true prevalence was calculated when a test was used with known test characteristics for the cut-off value used. Among unvaccinated herds, the true prevalence of BMT antibodies against BVDV was estimated at 66 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 56 – 77 %], M. avium ssp. paratuberculosis 68 % (95 % CI: 59 – 77 %), bovine herpesvirus type 1 62 % (95 % CI: 52 – 73 %), Leptospira Hardjo 47 % (95 % CI: 34 – 60 %), and Salmonella spp. 48 % (95 % CI: 39 – 56 %). The apparent prevalence of BMT antibodies against C. burnetii was 80 % (95 % CI: 75 – 85 %), F. hepatica 55 % (95 % CI: 48 – 62 %), N. caninum 46 % (95 % CI: 38 – 54 %), and O. ostertagi 95 % (95 % CI: 91 – 98 %). The BVDV, C. burnetii, and Chlamydia-like antigens were detected in 5 (95 % CI: 2 – 9 %), 29 (95 % CI: 21 – 36 %), and 31 % (95 % CI: 24 – 38 %) of herds, respectively. Our results show that dairy cows across GB are frequently exposed to the studied pathogens, which are endemic at high levels with some geographical variations. These prevalence estimates provide a much-needed basis to assess whether nationwide control programs for the studied pathogens are justified by their potential economic, environmental, and public health implications. Should surveillance and control programs be initiated, the estimates presented here are a baseline against which progress can be assessed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Bovine viral {{diarrhoea}} (BVD) is {{an infectious}} disease of cattle with a worldwide distribution. Herd-level prevalence varies among European Union (EU) member states, and prevalence information facilitates decision-making and monitoring {{of progress in}} control and eradication programmes. The primary objective {{of the present study}} was to address significant knowledge gaps regarding herd BVD seroprevalence (based on pooled sera) and control on Irish farms, including vaccine usage. Methods Preliminary validation of an indirect BVD antibody ELISA test (Svanova, Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using pooled sera was a novel and important aspect of the present study. Serum pools were constructed from serum samples of known seropositivity and pools were analysed using the same test in laboratory replicates. The output from this indirect ELISA was expressed as a percentage positivity (PP) value. Results were used to guide selection of a proposed cut-off (PCO) PP. This indirect ELISA was applied to randomly constructed within-herd serum pools, in a cross-sectional study of a stratified random sample of 1, 171 Irish dairy and beef cow herds in 2009, for which vaccination status was determined by telephone survey. The herd-level prevalence of BVD in Ireland (percentage positive herds) was estimated in non-vaccinating herds, where herds were classified positive when herd pool result exceeded PCO PP. Vaccinated herds were excluded because of the potential impact of vaccination on herd classification status. Comparison of herd-level classification was conducted in a subset of 111 non-vaccinating dairy herds using the same ELISA on <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> <b>tank</b> (BMT) samples. Associations between possible risk factors (herd size (quartiles)) and herd-level prevalence were determined using chi-squared analysis. Results Receiver Operating Characteristics Analysis of replicate results in the preliminary validation study yielded an optimal cut-off PP (Proposed Cut-off percentage positivity - PCO PP) of 7. 58 %. This PCO PP gave a relative sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of 98. 57 % and 100 % respectively, relative to the use of the ELISA on individual sera, and was chosen as the optimal cut-off since it resulted in maximization of the prevalence independent Youden’s Index. The herd-level BVD prevalence in non-vaccinating herds was 98. 7 % (95 % CI - 98. 3 - 99. 5 %) in the cross-sectional study with no significant difference between dairy and beef herds (98. 3 % vs 98. 8 %, respectively, p[*]=[*] 0. 595).

40|$|Q fever is a {{zoonotic}} disease, {{caused by}} the obligate intracellular bacterium Coxiella burnetii. Between 2007 and 2010, Q fever {{has been a major}} public health concern in the Netherlands, with almost 3500 human cases reported and dairy goats considered to be the most probable source. At the end of 2009, the Dutch government decided to cull all pregnant dairy sheep and dairy goats based on <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> C. burnetii positive farms, aiming to preventing shedding and to reducing environmental contamination. On <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> C. burnetii PCR positive farms, a life-time breeding ban was implemented for all remaining non-pregnant small ruminants. This study describes test results on a <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> C. burnetii PCR positive dairy goat farm on which all goats had been vaccinated against Q fever with an inactivated phase one vaccine since 2008. All pregnant dairy goats of this farm were culled in 2010, after which <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> was negative in the C. burnetii PCR. One year later, however, this farm became <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> C. burnetii PCR positive again. From all lactating animals on the farm (n = 350), individual milk samples were collected and tested using a commercial real-time PCR assay. Individual milk samples from five dairy goats appeared to be C. burnetii PCR positive. These positive goats had been born on the farm between 2002 and 2006. At postmortem examination, out of 33 mostly tissue samples per animal, only milk and mammary tissue samples were C. burnetii PCR positive. Moreover, immunohistochemical examination did not reveal the source of C. burnetii. After culling of these C. burnetii PCR milk positive animals, the <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> remained negative in C. burnetii PCR {{until the end of the}} observation period. The results indicate that vaccination of Q fever infected dairy goat farms does not completely prevent intermittent shedding of C. burnetii in probably previously infected goats.
