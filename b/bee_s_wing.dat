This does show, however, that becoming a dwarf queen can be beneficial.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{born out}} of a yearlong study of Michel Colombier 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> composition <b>Wings.</b> The dissertation falls into two parts: {{the first is a}} concentrated study on Colombier 2 ̆ 7 s score and the second is my response to the score - Evolution, a rock symphony for jazz orchestra. Wings can be understood as an allegory of the struggles of contemporary society; therefore, in order to gain as much knowledge as possible about the creation of Wings, I found it necessary to conduct a brief study into the social and political climate of the 1960 s. The function of chapter one is to show the symbiotic relationship between the social climate of the 1960 s, the emergence of greater numbers of students, and the increasing sophistication of rock music - factors that I believe have had a profound influence on Colombier 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Wings.</b> I have attempted to show this using two distinct headings: A social overview and Rock As a High Art Form. In the second chapter, I will discuss Michel Colombier 2 ̆ 7 s life in music. His musical upbringing will be discussed as well as his musical influences and career achievements. The third chapter will contain a short study of three forerunners of Wings: Deep Purple 2 ̆ 7 s Concerto For Group and Orchestra, Leonard Bernstein 2 ̆ 7 s Mass, and the music of Emerson Lake 2 ̆ 6 Palmer. A detailed description of the genesis of Colombier 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Wings</b> will follow- an account of its reception history will also be given. The analysis of Colombier 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Wings</b> will take place in chapter four, and will begin with some primary observations of the work, followed by a study of its libretto. The chapter will conclude with a detailed analysis of three sections of the work: Freedom 2 ̆ 6 Fear, Earth and Thalassa. Chapter five will present an overview of my own composition Evolution. An analytical comparison between Evolution and Wings, focussing on specific musical examples, will follow...|$|R

50|$|One {{insecticide}} in Brazil is Fipronil which inhibits GABA receptors of {{the nervous}} system, resulting in seizures, paralysis, and death. S. postica is in contact with Fipronil which is extremely toxic to bees. Compared to other <b>bees,</b> <b>S.</b> postica tolerate higher doses of Fipronil, but the toxicity is still high. Another toxic insecticide widely used in Brazil is Imidacloprid. Similar to Fipronil, S. postica are relatively more tolerant of this insecticide. The route of intoxication {{is very important in}} determining how lethal Imidacloprid is to the <b>S.</b> postica <b>bees.</b> Imidacloprid is significantly more toxic to S. postica through topical exposure compared to consumption of the insecticide. The increase in use of pesticides could cause a decline in pollinators like S. postica hurting the environments of Brazil.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that colonies of the stingless bee Tetragonisca angustula have hovering guards that can detect allospecific intruder bees with volatile odours or different body colour, but conspecific intruders were not detected. Here we show that T. angustula colony entrances are also defended by guards standing on the entrance tube. These standing guards made very few errors in recognition, accepting 100 % of the nestmates and rejecting 92 % of the conspecific non-nestmates presented to them at the nest entrance. In addition, 87 % of the nestmates contaminated with odours from the stingless bee Scaptotrigona bipunctata were rejected. Standing guards also reacted to volatile odours from the stingless <b>bees</b> <b>S.</b> bipunctata and Melipona rufiventris by switching to hovering. The defence reaction, i. e. {{the increase in the number}} of hovering guards, was not, however, comparable to the reaction previously reported to citral, the propaganda chemical used by the obligate robber bee Lestrimelitta limao when attacking other bee colonies...|$|R

40|$|During {{the space}} shuttle return-to-flight {{preparations}} following the Columbia accident, finite element models were needed that could predict the threshold of critical damage to the orbiter <b>s</b> <b>wing</b> leading edge from ice debris impacts. Hence, an experimental program was initiated to provide crushing data from impacted ice for use in dynamic finite element material models. A high-speed drop tower was configured to capture force time-histories of ice cylinders for impacts up to approximately 100 ft/s. At low velocity, the force-time history depended heavily on the internal crystalline structure of the ice. However, for velocities of 100 ft/s and above, the ice fractured on impact, behaved more like a fluid, and the subsequent force-time history curves were much less dependent on the internal crystalline structure...|$|R
