50|$|One form of {{settlement}} risk is foreign exchange settlement risk or cross-currency settlement risk, sometimes called Herstatt risk after the German bank {{that made a}} famous example of the risk. On 26 June 1974, the bank's license was withdrawn by German regulators {{at the end of}} the <b>banking</b> <b>day</b> (4:30pm local time) because of a lack of income and capital to cover liabilities that were due. But some banks had undertaken foreign exchange transactions with Herstatt and had already paid Deutsche Mark to the bank during the day, believing they would receive US dollars later the same day in the US from Herstatt's US nostro. But after 3:30 pm in Germany and 10:30 am in New York, Herstatt stopped all dollar payments to counterparties, leaving the counterparties unable to collect their payment. The closing of Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1990 did not cause similar problems because the Bank of England had set up a special scheme which ensured that payments were completed. Barings in 1995 resulted in minor losses for counterparties in the foreign exchange market because of a specific complexity in the ECU clearing system.|$|E
40|$|Payment system {{reform in}} New Zealand – {{the start of}} real time gross {{settlement}} Bruce White, Economics Department From March 1998, the inter-bank settlement of most high value wholesale payments in New Zealand will occur on a real time gross settlement (RTGS) basis. This means that the interbank transfer of funds associated with each such payment will be posted to the exchange settlement accounts of the paying and receiving banks at the Reserve Bank, transaction by transaction, irrevocably and ahead of value being credited/debited to the banks ’ respective customers. Up until now, the inter-bank transfer of funds has not occurred {{until the end of}} each <b>banking</b> <b>day.</b> The introduction of RTGS will remove the inter-bank exposure that banks have carried when they give irrevocable value to their customers ahead of the time they receive inter-bank settlement of those payments. And where this exposure does not exist because the payments could be reversed should the paying bank fail to settle, RTGS provides a mechanism that enables the spectre of such reversals to be eliminated...|$|E
