50|$|The USART's {{synchronous}} capabilities {{were primarily}} intended to support synchronous protocols like IBM's <b>Synchronous</b> transmit-receive (STR), <b>Binary</b> <b>Synchronous</b> Communications (BSC), Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC), and the ISO-standard High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) synchronous link-layer protocols, which were used with synchronous voice-frequency modems. These protocols {{were designed to}} make the best use of bandwidth when modems were analog devices. In those times, the fastest asynchronous voice-band modem could achieve at most speeds of 300 bit/s using frequency-shift keying modulation, while synchronous modems could run at speeds up to 9600 bit/s using phase-shift keying. <b>Synchronous</b> <b>transmission</b> used only slightly over 80% of the bandwidth of the now more-familiar asynchronous transmission, since start and stop bits were unnecessary. Those modems are obsolete, having been replaced by modems which convert asynchronous data to synchronous forms, but similar synchronous telecommunications protocols survive in numerous block-oriented technologies such as the widely used IEEE 802.2 (Ethernet) link-level protocol. USARTs are still sometimes integrated with MCUs. USARTs are still used in routers that connect to external CSU/DSU devices, and they often use either Cisco's proprietary HDLC implementation or the IETF standard Point-to-Point Protocol in HDLC-like framing as defined in RFC 1662.|$|R

Considering the important role of synchronous belts in the functioning of mechanisms, they are the subject of many studies and research in order to define more finely. Behavior of mechanisms that lead is influenced by their mechanical characteristics. Also, to better master their behavior, extent of the characteristics of longitudinal stiffness and stiffness of the teeth is required.

50|$|<b>Binary</b> <b>Synchronous</b> Communication (BSC or Bisync) is an IBM character-oriented, {{half-duplex}} link protocol, announced in 1967 after {{the introduction of}} System/360. It replaced the synchronous transmit-receive (STR) protocol used with second generation computers. The intent was that common link management rules could be used with three different character encodings for messages. Six-bit Transcode looked backwards to older systems; USASCII with 128 characters and EBCDIC with 256 characters looked forward. Transcode disappeared very quickly but the EBCDIC and USASCII dialects of Bisync continued in use.|$|R
50|$|Early {{synchronous}} protocols were byte-oriented protocols, where synchronization {{was maintained}} by transmitting {{a sequence of}} synchronous idle characters when the line was not actively transmitting data or transparently within a long transmission block. A certain number of idles were sent prior to each <b>transmission.</b> The IBM <b>Binary</b> <b>Synchronous</b> protocol (Bisync) is still in use, Other examples of byte-oriented protocols are IBM's Synchronous transmit-receive (STR), and Digital Data Communications Message Protocol (DDCMP) from Digital Equipment Corporation. Other computer manufacturers often offered similar protocols, differing mainly in small details.|$|R

The purpose is to use exclusively integer decision variables which work better with the synchronous condenser machine types defined in DIgSILENT PowerFactory and with the <b>binary</b> <b>synchronous</b> condenser allocation flag BUS^i. For evaluation of the exact cost of a synchronous condenser, (6) is then changed to (5). The integer decision variable related to the machine type Typ^iis thus converted into its counterpart in S_n^i (Table  1), allowing the objective function to calculate the correct total installation cost.|$|R
