50|$|The {{ecoregion}} {{is home to}} 276 bird species, none {{of which}} are endemic. Large threatened birds include the lesser florican (Eupodotis indica) and Indian <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps).</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are more}} than 400 species of birds in the region {{including}} the endemic rufous-vented prinia (Prinia burnesii), the near-endemic white-winged tit (Parus nuchalis) and the threatened great Indian <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> and lesser florican (Eupodotis indica).|$|R
50|$|Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary (established in 1979, {{also known}} as the Jawaharlal Nehru Bustard Sanctuary of Maharashtra) is a {{wildlife}} sanctuary for the great Indian <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> at Solapur, Maharashtra, India. The land is drought-prone and semi-arid. Its ecoregion is that of Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests.|$|R
50|$|The dry grasslands that predominate {{do provide}} habitat for the native fauna {{remaining}} scattered amid the thorn scrub. The grasslands of southern Andhra Pradesh support a good {{population of the}} great Indian <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> and blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra), although these and other species are declining in number.|$|R
25|$|Many {{types of}} birds are found {{throughout}} the basin, such as myna, Psittacula parakeets, crows, kites, partridges, and fowls. Ducks and snipes migrate across the Himalayas during the winter, attracted in large numbers to wetland areas. There are no endemic birds in the upper Gangetic Plain. The great Indian <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> and lesser florican (Sypheotides indicus) are considered globally threatened.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the twenty}} three {{species of the}} {{bustards}} found in the world, the magnificent, tall, long-necked great Indian <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> {{is the only one}} to have been recorded as endangered according to the 2009 IUCN Red List Category (as evaluated by Bird Life International - the official Red List Authority for birds for IUCN). This categorization is {{based on the fact that}} its population is on the decline as a result of hunting and continued agricultural development.|$|R
50|$|The {{ecoregion}} {{is home to}} 75 mammal species. Threatened species {{include the}} Indian elephant (Elephas maximus), wild dog (Cuon alpinus), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), chousingha (Tetracerus quadricornis), gaur (Bos gaurus), and grizzled giant squirrel (Ratufa macruora). Salim Ali's fruit bat (Latidens salimalii) is critically endangered, and is near-endemic. 260 species of birds live in the eco-region, and two, the rufous babbler (Turdoides subrufus) and yellow-throated bulbul (Pycnonotus xantholaemus) are near-endemic.

40|$|The Great Indian <b>Bustard</b> <b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps,</b> a {{threatened}} and endemic {{species of the}} Indian subcontinent, is declining in its natural habitats. The Great Indian Bustard is a bird of open land and was observed using the grasslands habitat (73 %), followed by areas covered with Prosopis (11 %). In the grasslands, the communities dominated with Cymbopogon martinii were utilized the highest, while those dominated by Aristida adenemsoidis were least utilized. As Cymbopogon martinii is non-palatable, we infer {{that it does not}} attract livestock and herdsmen resulting in minimum movement and trampling that favors the Great Indian Bustard...|$|R
50|$|Maharashtra {{is one of}} the {{six states}} of India where great Indian <b>bustards</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> are still seen. The great Indian bustard at Nannaj and Karmala was first {{identified}} By Mr B.S.Kulkarni in 1972 and with his constant efforts to save the bird had resulted in Dr. Salim Ali visiting Nannaj and starting a research project. Mr Kulkarni wrote extensively in local newspapers and made people aware of its existence and he is still active in trying to protect the bird and its habitat at Nannaj, near Solapur. In former days the bustard was a common bird in the dry districts of Maharashtra.|$|R
50|$|The Great Indian <b>Bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> or Indian <b>bustard</b> is a bustard {{found in}} India and the {{adjoining}} regions of Pakistan. A large bird with a horizontal body and long bare legs, giving it an ostrich like appearance, this bird {{is among the}} heaviest of the flying birds. Once common on the dry plains of the Indian subcontinent, as few as 250 individuals were estimated in 2011 to survive and the species is critically endangered by hunting and loss of its habitat, which consists of large expanses of dry grassland and scrub. These birds are often found associated in the same habitat as blackbuck. It is protected under Wildlife Protection Act 1972 of India.|$|R
50|$|Ravi Sankaran (October 4, 1963 - January 17, 2009) was an Indian ornithologist {{whose work}} {{concerned}} {{the conservation of}} several threatened birds of India. He was the Director of the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. Ravi studied at the Rishi Valley School, Madanapalli, Andhra Pradesh; obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Zoology from Loyola College, Chennai and a doctorate from Bombay Natural History Society Ravi joined the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) in 1985 in the endangered species project on the great Indian <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> and florican species (family Otididae) and {{played a role in}} developing recovery plans for these species. He also established Florican Watch, involving local people.|$|R
50|$|The huge {{adult male}} great bustard is {{possibly}} the heaviest living flying animal. It is also {{arguably the most}} sexual dimorphic extant bird species, {{in terms of the}} size difference between males and females. Going on mass, the only known bird with a higher dimorphism is the green peafowl (Pavo muticus) as the males are apparently near four times as heavy as the female. Among both bustards and all living birds, the upper reported mass of this species is rivaled by that of the kori <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> kori), which, due to its relatively longer tarsi and tail, is both longer and taller on average and is less sexually dimorphic. In terms of weight ranges reported, the great Indian <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> also only lags slightly behind these species. A male is typically 90 - 105 cm tall, with a length of around 115 cm and has a 2.1 - 2.7 m wingspan. The male can range in weight from 5.8 to 18 kg. Average male weights as reported have been fairly variable: in Russia, males weighed a median of 9.2 kg; in Spain, males weighed a mean of 9.82 kg during breeding season and 10.62 kg during non-breeding; in Germany, males weighed a mean of 11.97 kg; and the Guinness World Records has indicated that prior to their extirpation male bustards in Great Britain weighed an average of 13.5 kg. In a study in Spain, one male weighed as much as 19 kg. The heaviest verified specimen, collected in Manchuria, was about 21 kg. Larger specimens have been reported but remain unverified.|$|R

50|$|The Arabian <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> arabs) is {{a species}} bustard which is found across the Sahel region of Africa and south western Arabia. It {{is part of}} the large-bodied genus, Ardeotis, and, though little known, appears to be a fairly typical species in that group.|$|R
50|$|Australian <b>bustards</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> australis) are {{frequently}} seen in farmland on {{approach to the}} Gorge, along with brolgas if the weather has been wet. Communally breeding birds, such as the white-winged chough, the laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), and the apostlebird (Struthidea cinerea), are {{a feature of the}} ecosystems around the entrance to Carnarvon Gorge.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{other birds}} that are {{sometimes}} called turkeys {{are not particularly}} closely related: the brushturkeys are megapodes, and the bird sometimes known as the [...] "Australian turkey" [...] is the Australian <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> australis). The anhinga (Anhinga anhinga) is sometimes called a water turkey, from the shape of its tail when the feathers are fully spread for drying.|$|R
50|$|The Australian <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> australis) {{is a large}} {{ground bird}} of grassland, {{woodland}} and open agricultural country across northern Australia and southern New Guinea.

50|$|The kori <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> kori) is {{the largest}} flying bird native to Africa. It {{is a member of}} the bustard family, which all belong to the order Otidiformes and are {{restricted}} in distribution to the Old World. It is one of the four species (ranging from Africa to India to Australia) in the large-bodied Ardeotis genus. In fact, the male kori bustard may be the heaviest living animal capable of flight.|$|R
50|$|Skilled in {{terrestrial}} hunting, the black-breasted buzzard {{is famous}} for its use of stones to crack the eggs of large ground-nesting birds such as the Emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae), Brolga (Grus rubicundus) and Australian <b>Bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> australis). Stones are either dropped onto or thrown at the eggs to break them open, allowing the buzzard to access the contents for food. The buzzard may also use its beak to crack eggs directly.|$|R
50|$|Diawling National Park {{is home to}} a {{remarkable}} variety of birds. The species found here include northern pintail (Anas acuta), northern shoveler (Anas clypeata), greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus), lesser flamingo (Phoeniconaias minor), Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia), African spoonbill (Platalea alba), great egret (Casmerodius albus), great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), Arabian <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> arabs), pied avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta), slender-billed gull (Larus genei), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), greater hoopoe-lark (Alaemon alaudipes) and Sudan golden sparrow (Passer luteus).|$|R
40|$|The {{density and}} {{distribution}} of the Australian <b>bustard</b> <b>Ardeotis</b> australis was determined from observations made during aerial surveys of kangaroos. Bustards were most abundant in the northern half of Australia, particularly on mitchell grass plains. They were rare or absent in much of southern Australia, on parts of which they were reported as common 100 years ago. Bustard density and distribution seems {{to be influenced by}} vegetation structure, land use and predation...|$|R
50|$|There are 379 {{species of}} birds in the park {{including}} the contiguous Logone floodplain; among the birds that have been sighted are marbled duck, ferruginous duck, greater spotted eagle, scissor-tailed kite in grass lands, lesser kestrel, Nubian bustard (Neotis nuba), quail-plover, Arabian <b>bustard</b> <b>Ardeotis</b> arabs, hippos heron, hornbill, gross hopper, starks, Abyssinian roller, and fast moving ostrich. However, some of the species of global conservation concern are: Marmaronetta angustirostris, Aythya nyroca, Clanga clanga, Falco naumanni, Neotis nuba, which has been recorded once, in 1998.|$|R

One-third of the world’s eagle species are reported from the Matobo National Park. Buff-spotted flufftail and stripe-cheeked bulbuls are seen across the country. The bateleur eagle is {{the only member of}} the genus Terathopius and probably the origin of the [...] "Zimbabwe Bird", the national emblem of Zimbabwe.|$|R
50|$|The bird {{sanctuary}} has about 165 species of birds; the lesser and greater flamingos, great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) and pink-backed pelican (Pelecanus rufescens) {{are the most}} dominant species, they arrive annually in large numbers {{as part of their}} migration during the winter season. Some of the other notable bird species recorded are: avocet, blackwinged stilt (Himantopus himantopus), blacksmith lapwing (Vanellus armatus), black-necked grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), bustards, carmine, darters, African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), geese, korhaans, pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), black-chested snake-eagle (Circaetus pectoralis), blue-cheeked bee-eater (Merops persicus), Cape teal (Anas capensis), kori <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> kori), Hottentot teal (Anas hottentota), martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus), red-knobbed coot, (Fulica cristata), secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius), spoonbills, and white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata).|$|R
50|$|Bustards are all {{fairly large}} {{with the two}} largest species, the kori <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> kori) and the great bustard (Otis tarda), being {{frequently}} cited as the world's heaviest flying birds. In both the largest species, large males exceed a weight of 20 kg, weigh around 13.5 kg on average and can attain a total length of 150 cm. The smallest species is the little brown bustard (Eupodotis humilis), which is around 40 cm long and weighs around 600 g on average. In most bustards, males are substantially larger than females, often about 30% longer and sometimes {{more than twice the}} weight. They are among the most sexually dimorphic groups of birds. In only the floricans is the sexual dimorphism reverse, with the adult female being slightly larger and heavier than the male.|$|R
40|$|Growing {{evidence}} suggests many widely distributed low-density tropical species are declining, but whether protected {{areas and the}} increasingly promoted multi-use community-managed wildlife areas mitigate causal threats is poorly studied. Lack of monitoring data and poorly understood species ecology limit knowledge of patterns, causal mechanisms and degree of abundance or range declines. Working in an African savanna, where bushmeat hunting and cattle-grazing are considered the greatest threats to wildlife, this thesis combined three approaches to study the conservation ecology of widely distributed wildlife at three spatial scales (continent-wide; landscape; home range). The continent-wide conservation status of Kori <b>Bustard</b> <b>Ardeotis</b> kori was assessed by reviewing occurrence records (1863 – 2009) across its range (14 countries). Range contraction was quantified by examining the proportion of historical records (pre- 1970) falling within the area delineated by recent records (1970 – 2009), finding 8...|$|R
50|$|The general {{limit for}} weight in flying birds is at about 25 kg, the {{exceptional}} Argentavis magnificens with {{its size and}} weight of a good-sized adult human notwithstanding as it evolved under unusual ecological conditions. Large males of the kori <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> kori) and great bustard (Otis tarda) are perfectly capable of flight, while weighing in excess of 20 kg. A wing loading of c. 25 kg/m2 is the known limit for bird flight under normal circumstances; thus, a case could be made for Eremopezus to have been capable of flight. Paleontologists do not consider this likely however, due to the stoutness of the bones, which in such a degree is only known from birds that were certainly flightless. The secretarybird's tarsometatarsus, for example, is only some 20% shorter but more than 60% slimmer than that of E. eocaenus. Thus, its wings and arm bones were probably reduced, a process known to have taken as little as 10,000 years in some island rails.|$|R
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{increase}} understanding of the size and composition of eggs from two subspecies of houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii and C. u. undulata). Eggs from the rufous-crested bustard (Eupodotis ruficrista) and kori <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> kori) were also examined for comparison. Infertile eggs were collected from captive birds; egg mass and linear dimensions were recorded, and egg component masses were determined wet and dry. Significant differences were observed {{in the composition of}} the eggs from the two houbara subspecies. Despite being smaller in size, eggs from the macqueenii subspecies had a relatively larger yolk (and relatively less albumen) than eggs from the undulata subspecies. The relative composition of the rufous-crested and kori bustard eggs showed patterns {{similar to that of the}} undulata eggs. For the houbara bustards, changes in initial egg mass (IEM) were associated with changes in egg length more than egg breadth, and changes in egg length and breadth appeared to be due more to increases in albumen mass than to increases in yolk mass...|$|R
50|$|The {{size and}} dark crest are {{generally}} diagnostic amongst the bustards {{found in the}} kori bustard's range. However, East Africa holds the greatest diversity of bustards anywhere, including some other quite large species, and these {{have the potential to}} cause confusion. Kori bustards are distinguished from Denham's bustard (Neotis denhamii) and Ludwig's bustard (Neotis luwigii), both of which they sometimes forage with, by their greyer appearance and by their lack of a tawny red hind-neck and upper mantle. In flight it can be distinguished from both of these somewhat smaller bustards by not displaying any white markings on the upperwing, which is uniformly grey here. Both Stanley's and Ludwig's bustards lack the kori's dark crest. More similar to, and nearly the same size as, the kori is the closely related Arabian <b>bustard</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> arabs) (despite its name, the latter species ranges well into East Africa). However, the Arabian species has white-tipped wing coverts, a browner back and very fine neck vermiculations and also lacks the black base to the neck and the black in the wing coverts as seen in the kori.|$|R
40|$|A {{review was}} {{conducted}} of 236 postmortem examinations of six species of captive and imported bustards in the United Arab Emirates {{for the period}} 1979 - 94. The most common causes of death in adult imported houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii) were euthanasia due to Newcastle disease, aspergillosis, and post-transportation-related deaths. Helminth parasites were a common finding in imported houbara bustards, and large parasite burdens occasionally caused intestinal obstruction and death. The most common causes of death in adult captive houbara bustards were trauma- related deaths and euthanasia for or death following treatment for capture myopathy. Fatty liver change was an important postmortem finding of captive adult houbara bustards. The main {{cause of death in}} juvenile houbara bustards was yolk-sac infection and septicemia. The most common causes of death in adult kori <b>bustards</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> kori) were capture myopathy and handling injuries or euthanasia following these injuries. The most common causes of death in adult rufous-crested bustards (Eupodotis ruficrista) were post- transportation deaths in imported birds and trichomoniasis and trauma in captive birds. Juvenile rufous crested bustards appeared to be highly susceptible to gizzard impactions and foreign-body obstructions of the gastrointestinal tract. Nutritional hone disease is an important disease of all juvenile bustards, particularly kori and houbara bustards. Aspergillosis was also a common postmortem finding in captive and imported adult houbara bustards and also caused mortality in juvenile kori and houbara bustards...|$|R
40|$|Bustards {{are large}} {{terrestrial}} birds that inhabit open plains, deserts, and dry bush country. The helminth parasites of captive houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata macqueeni), rufous-crested bustards (Eupodotis ruficrista), and kori <b>bustards</b> (<b>Ardeotis</b> kori) {{have been investigated}} at the National Avian Research Centre (NARC) and the International Institute of Parasitology. The cestode species recovered include Hispaniolepis falsata, Ascometra vestita, Ascometra choriotidis, Otiditaenia conoideis, Otiditaenia macqueeni, Raillietina neyrai, and Idiogenes sp. The acanthocephalans Mediorhynchus taeniatus and Centrorhynchus lancea were also recovered. A host-parasite list is presented here. Chlamydotis undulata macqueeni is a new host for A. choriotidis, C. lancea, and R. neyrai, and E. ruficrista is a new host for O. macqueeni. Ascometra choriotidis, R. neyrai, O. macqueeni, H. falsata, M. taeniatus, and C. lancea records are new for the United Arab Emirates. Cestodes were recovered from 18 of 78 houbara bustards, two of three kori bustards, and four of 10 rufous-crested bustards. Pathologic findings in the intestinal tract associated with cestode infection included inflammation, mild atrophy, collapse, and fibrosis of the intestinal mucosa. In some birds, the number of parasites was sufficient to partially obstruct the intestinal lumen. Administration of a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg praziquantel was effective in treating kori bustards known to be infected with the cestode O. conoideis. Importation of stock for captive breeding programs may introduce parasites from one region into anothe...|$|R
