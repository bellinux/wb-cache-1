5|$|Another {{breakthrough}} came in 1931, {{when the}} American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza {{and several other}} viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs. In 1949, John Franklin Enders, Thomas Weller, and Frederick Robbins grew polio virus in cultured human embryo cells, the first virus to <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> without using solid animal tissue or eggs. This work enabled Jonas Salk to make an effective polio vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria can <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> in the {{laboratory}} on nutrient culture media, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate. Many vaccines to infectious diseases can <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> in fertilised chicken eggs. Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that takes about {{six months after the}} decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine. A problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available. Cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when {{it may be difficult to}} acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertile eggs.|$|E

5|$|Growing medium - Free-draining, humus-rich, {{somewhat}} acid {{growing media}} {{are used for}} commercial production, such as a mixture of peat or leafmould and an inert material such as grit, sharp sand or polystyrene beads.

5|$|Hippeastrum cultivars {{and species}} can <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> inside in pots or outside in warmer climates (Hardiness 7B-11).

5|$|It was {{not until}} after 9,500 BC that the eight {{so-called}} founder crops of agriculture appear: first emmer and einkorn wheat, then hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas and flax. These eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) sites in the Levant, although wheat {{was the first to}} <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> and harvested on a significant scale. At around the same time (9400 BC), parthenocarpic fig trees were domesticated.|$|E

5|$|Large single {{crystals}} (many cubic centimeters) can <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> by the gas transport (vapor-phase deposition), hydrothermal synthesis, or melt growth. However, {{because of}} high vapor pressure of ZnO, growth from the melt is problematic. Growth by gas transport is difficult to control, leaving the hydrothermal method as a preference. Thin films can be produced by chemical vapor deposition, metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy, electrodeposition, pulsed laser deposition, sputtering, sol-gel synthesis, atomic layer deposition, spray pyrolysis, etc.|$|E
5|$|Lettuce is {{the only}} member of the Lactuca genus to <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> commercially. Although China is the top world {{producer}} of lettuce, the majority of the crop is consumed domestically. Spain is the world's largest exporter of lettuce, with the US ranking second.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are {{essential}} tools in biotechnology, biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology. The yeasts brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) are important model organisms in science, {{since they are}} simple eukaryotes that can <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated. They are particularly valuable in genetics, genomics and proteomics, for example in protein production.|$|E

5|$|Though {{virtually}} unseen in nature, high-purity bismuth {{can form}} distinctive, colorful hopper crystals. It is relatively nontoxic {{and has a}} low melting point just above 271Â°C, so crystals may <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> using a household stove, although the resulting crystals will tend to be lower quality than lab-grown crystals.|$|E
5|$|As {{far back}} as the Iron Age, Welsh folk were using wild cereals to create a coarse bread. By the time the Romans invaded, Celtic skills with bread had progressed to the point that white or brown breads could be produced. The Roman {{invasion}} led to many Welsh people moving to the less hospitable uplands, where the only cereal crops which could <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> were oats, barley and rye. Oat and barley breads were the main breads eaten in Wales up until the 19th century, with rye bread created for medicinal purposes. Oats were used to bulk out meat or meat and vegetable stews, also known as pottage.|$|E

5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare can <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> in {{pure culture}} on agar-containing plates {{supplemented}} with nutrients. The colonies that grow are white to pale cream, {{and cover the}} agar surface within six weeks from the initial inoculation. The mycelium is made of bent-over hyphae, without any aerial hyphae (hyphae that extend above {{the surface of the}} agar). Typically, two indistinct zones develop at about 6mm and 15mm from the initial inoculum spot, with each zone roughly 4mm wide. The zones appear somewhat lighter in color because the hyphae are more closely packed and form crystalline substances that deposit into the agar.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aquilonia adapts {{readily to}} {{cultivation}} in humid or temperate climates, but is rarely cultivated. A fast-growing plant, it can grow in acidic soils from pH 3.5 to 6.5. Propagation is generally by seed, and plants flower at {{four to six}} years of age. Vegetative propagation is possible from semi-hardened cuttings of pencil thickness. The flower spikes attract birds to the garden. It can also <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> in a pot, with its branches heavily pruned to keep foliage dense.|$|E
5|$|Before being {{acquired}} by the society, the Corstorphine hill site was a nursery, once owned by Thomas Blaikie, who planted many of the great French parks such as âLa Bagatelleâ. On this site two nurserymen raised the famous apple cultivars âJohn Downieâ and âJames Grieveâ. Today, the zoo {{has one of the}} most diverse tree collections in the Lothians with 120 species. The south-facing aspect allows bananas to <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> outside. Increasingly, horticulture is seen as a discipline in its own right, with the focus on habitat creation within enclosures, food stuffs for the animals, and enrichment for both the animals and the visiting public.|$|E

5|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} is {{a method}} by which diamond can <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> from a hydrocarbon gas mixture. Since the early 1980s, this method {{has been the subject}} of intensive worldwide research. Whereas the mass-production of high-quality diamond crystals make the HPHT process the more suitable choice for industrial applications, the flexibility and simplicity of CVD setups explain the popularity of CVD growth in laboratory research. The advantages of CVD diamond growth include the ability to grow diamond over large areas and on various substrates, and the fine control over the chemical impurities and thus properties of the diamond produced. Unlike HPHT, CVD process does not require high pressures, as the growth typically occurs at pressures under 27 kPa.|$|E
5|$|Collected and {{described}} by Robert Brown {{in the early}} 19th century, Banksia speciosa is classified in the series Banksia within the genus. Its closest relative is B. baxteri. Banksia speciosa plants are killed by bushfire, and regenerate from seed. The flowers attract nectar- and insect-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters, {{and a variety of}} insects. In cultivation, Banksia speciosa grows well in a sunny location on well-drained soil in areas with dry summers. It cannot <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> in areas with humid summers, though it has been grafted onto Banksia serrata or B.integrifolia.|$|E
5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{cultivated}} New Zealand native trees. In Northwest Europe and other cool oceanic climates, it is very popular as an ornamental tree because it looks like a palm tree. Hardy forms from the coldest areas of the southern or inland South Island tolerate Northern Hemisphere conditions best, while North Island forms are much more tender. It is easily grown from fresh seed â seedlings often spontaneously appear in gardens from bird-dispersed seed â and can <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> very easily from shoot, stem and even trunk cuttings. It does well in pots and tubs.|$|E
