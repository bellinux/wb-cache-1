5|$|In December 1996, Patton {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to consider the}} issue of worker's compensation reform. Both Patton and the state's legislators believed that the generous benefits provided under Kentucky state law created an unfavorable business climate in the state. The reform measures adopted in the special session included a substantial reduction in benefits, including those to coal miners who developed <b>black</b> <b>lung</b> disease. Patton's support of this measure alienated labor leaders, especially in eastern Kentucky's coal mining communities â€“ which had previously been among his strongest supporters. As the law began to take effect, Patton himself agreed that it had gone too far, and his Secretary of Labor worked with representatives from organized labor to draft changes in the law. Those changes were eventually made in the 2002 legislative session.|$|E
5|$|On October 7, 1987, Collins {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to close a}} deficit between state contributions to the worker's compensation Special Fund and disbursements. The Special Fund was designated for payments to workers with occupational diseases and workers whose work-related injuries could not be traced to any single employer. A plan proposed by Democratic state senator Ed O'Daniel was expected to {{provide the framework for}} legislation considered in the session. Under O'Daniel's plan, additional revenue for the Special Fund would be raised by increasing assessments on worker's compensation premiums for 30 years. Assessments for coal companies were increased more than those on other businesses because the majority of the claims paid from the Special Fund were for <b>black</b> <b>lung,</b> a breathing disease common among coal miners; consequently, it was opposed by legislators from heavily coal-dependent counties. Nevertheless, after nine days of negotiations, a bill substantially similar to O'Daniel's original plan was approved by the legislature and signed by Collins.|$|E
5|$|The work {{performed}} by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys {{were forced to}} work without gloves {{so that they could}} better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only {{at the end of the}} working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and <b>black</b> <b>lung</b> disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.|$|E

25|$|Coal dust is {{responsible}} for the lung disease known as pneumoconiosis, including <b>black</b> <b>lung</b> disease that occurs among coal miners. The danger of coal dust resulted in environmental legislation regulating work place air quality in some jurisdictions. In addition, if enough coal dust is dispersed within the air in a given area, in very rare circumstances, it can create an explosion hazard under certain circumstances. These circumstances are typically within confined spaces.|$|E
25|$|Webb's {{family moved}} north to Wabash, Indiana, {{when she was}} four. Four years later, her father died of Coalworker's pneumoconiosis, also known as <b>black</b> <b>lung</b> disease.

While still in high school, she began to tour with her sister for a few weeks each summer.|$|E
40|$|People {{who live}} in cities with dirty air have <b>blacker</b> <b>lungs</b> than people {{who live in}} rural areas with less air pollution. This is because, {{although}} particulates larger than 10 microm are filtered out when inhaled air passes through the nose, smaller particulates reach the lower airways. The particulates that reach the alveoli (the terminal air pockets of the lungs) stay there permanently. This accounts for the fact that a person who has lived in a polluted city for many years has <b>blacker</b> <b>lungs</b> than one who has lived in a polluted city for a shorter time...|$|R

40|$|Production and {{delivery}} of macrophages to the alveoli are dependent upon chemotactic and mitogenic stimuli. To determine whether these mechanisms occur uniformly throughout the lungs or are localized to the areas of particulate deposition, the authors instilled 4 mg of carbon in one lung of a rat, the other lung serving as a control. Following split-lung lavage, little change {{was seen in the}} number of cells lavaged from nontreated lungs, whereas the yield of macrophages from the <b>black</b> <b>lungs</b> rose from 32 X 10 (4) to 400 X 10 (4) after 2 days; control values were not attained until 3 weeks. Labeling indices for cell nuclei in the white lungs were slightly elevated, whereas in the <b>black</b> <b>lungs</b> the value rose from 0. 4 to 1. 0 - 1. 5 % for 3 weeks before falling to normal. The increased labeling was limited to interstitial cells. The results provide further support for the dual origin of alveolar macrophages and indicate the importance of local generation of chemotactic and mitogenic factors in stimulating the cellular response and in directing these cells to the sites of maximal deposition of particles...|$|R
