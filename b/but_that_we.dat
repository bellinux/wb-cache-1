5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E
25|$|Kritiks: The {{negative}} {{can claim}} that the affirmative is guilty of a certain mindset or assumption that should be grounds for rejection or a different mutually exclusive alternative to the Affirmatives plan. Kritiks are sometimes a reason to reject the entire affirmative advocacy without evaluating its policy; other times, kritiks can be evaluated within the same framework for evaluation as the affirmative case. Examples of some areas of literature for kritiks include biopower, racism, centralized government, and anthropocentrism. Kritiks arose in the early 1990s, with the first kritiks based in deconstructionist philosophy about the intrinsic ambiguity of language and were championed by debaters Shane Stafford and Bill Shanahan. Kritiks today have evolved to sometimes include the affirmative advocacy within their alternatives. These kritiks argue that the ontological or epistemological assumptions behind the affirmative are flawed {{and ought to be}} rejected, but the plan itself is fine. For example, an affirmative could argue that {{it would be good to}} reduce our nuclear stockpile to avoid global proliferation out of fear of rogue states acquiring nuclear weapons. The negative could respond with an aff-inclusive kritik that argues that it would be good to reduce our nuclear stockpile because nuclear weapons are unethical, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> ought not conceptualize other states as fundamentally dangerous.|$|E

500|$|Just {{as he had}} as {{baseball}} commissioner, Chandler faced the issue of racial integration during his second term as governor. Among his first actions upon his election was to issue an executive order ensuring that blacks and whites would have equal access to the state park system. He publicly acknowledged the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education as {{the law of the}} land and promised to enforce it. The Kentucky Court of Appeals struck down Kentucky's Day Law—the law proscribing integration—the following year. Some areas of the state resisted the change. Notably, in 1956, when nine black students in Sturgis, Kentucky attempted to enter previously all-white Sturgis High School, they were blocked by 500 opponents of integration. On September 4, 1956, Chandler called out the National Guard—including a force of over 900 guardsmen and several M47 Patton tanks—to disperse the crowd. The confrontation lasted a total of 18 days before the protesters peacefully dispersed. Shortly thereafter, Chandler took similar actions in response to a protest in the town of Clay, which was also resolved without violence. Of his actions, Chandler remarked [...] "We regret it is necessary to use this means of guaranteeing equal rights to our citizens, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must do." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's victory {{meant they}} won the FA Cup for the seventh time, the club's manager Rafael Benítez stated that neither side {{deserved}} to lose the match: [...] "It was difficult to say we deserved to win or the other team. It was a magnificent final. We knew that they could score goals <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could also. We needed to keep going but after 63 games it was really difficult." [...] Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard also praised West Ham, stating: [...] "West Ham were brilliant, they gave us a really good game {{but we had a}} never-say-die attitude and we stuck in there, our best chance was on penalties as we did not have any energy left." [...] Due {{to the nature of the}} comeback, the match has come to be regarded as The Gerrard Final, teammate Peter Crouch summed up the effect Gerrard had on the match: [...] "When the injury-time board went up we thought our chance had gone, but it is always good to have a player like Steven Gerrard in your team." [...] A BBC Sport poll in May 2015 deemed Gerrard's goal to be the best in an FA Cup Final from the past 50 years.|$|E
500|$|Nintendo has {{hoped to}} target a wider {{demographic}} with its console {{than that of}} others in the seventh generation. At a press conference for the then-upcoming Nintendo DS game [...] in December 2006, Satoru Iwata insisted [...] "We're not thinking about fighting Sony, but about how many people we can get to play games. The thing we're thinking about most is not portable systems, consoles, and so forth, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> want to get new people playing games." [...] This is reflected in Nintendo's series of television advertisements in North America (directed by Academy Award winner Stephen Gaghan) and its Internet ads. The advertising slogans were [...] "Wii would like to play" [...] and [...] "Experience a new way to play"; the ads began November 15, 2006, and had a total budget of over US$200million for the year. The productions were Nintendo's first broad-based advertising strategy and included a two-minute video clip showing an assortment of people enjoying the Wii system: urban apartment-dwellers, ranchers, grandparents, and parents with their children. The music in the ads was from the song [...] "Kodo (Inside the Sun Remix)" [...] by the Yoshida Brothers. The marketing campaign was successful; pensioners as old as 103 were reported to be playing the Wii in the United Kingdom. A report by the British newspaper The People also stated that Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom has used the console.|$|E

500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants {{you to have a}} purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able to}} get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E
2500|$|Huckabee proclaimed 1997 {{as a year}} {{of racial}} {{reconciliation}} by saying [...] "Let {{every one of us}} make it our priority to bring reconciliation, not so much that we can force it or legislate it, because we cannot, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> begin in each of our own lives to purpose in our hearts that we will not harbor anger, hostility, prejudice, bigotry and racism toward any person." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cosmos is {{not just}} about the mysteries of space. Sagan leads every chapter with a {{philosophical}} quote to remind readers that the universe is not simply stars and planets, but a link between all things. He reminds readers that [...] "we are all star stuff," [...] and, though it seems humans are currently alone in space, the universe was not created for our race to thrive, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are a product of something much larger. Sagan's book explicitly supports the search for intelligent extraterrestrial life, as he believes the extraterrestrials will be able to spur an enormous change in life on Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Philo {{considers}} Caligula's plan {{to erect}} a statue of himself in the temple of Jerusalem to be a provocation, asking, [...] "Are you making war upon us, because you anticipate {{that we will not}} endure such indignity, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will fight on behalf of our laws, and die in defence of our national customs? For you cannot possibly have been ignorant of what was likely to result from your attempt to introduce these innovations respecting our temple." [...] In his entire presentation, he implicitly supports the Jewish commitment to rebel against the emperor rather than allow such sacrilege to take place.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Fass puts {{forward the}} {{possibility}} that business scandals {{in the real world}} make students believe dishonesty is an acceptable method for achieving success in contemporary society. [...] Academic dishonesty, in this case, would be practice for the real world. For some students, there would be a dichotomy between success and honesty, and their decision is that: [...] "It is not that we love honesty less, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> love success more." [...] Conversely, other scholars consider that with the recent rise in corporate ethics related dismissals in the business world, this approach to cheating may be losing its appeal, if it ever really had any. However, {{it has been shown that}} the expected benefits of cheating as well as student's morality plays an important role for the engagement in dishonest behavior.|$|E

2500|$|The {{essential}} {{point of}} this exercise is often missed. Wittgenstein's point {{is not that it}} is impossible to define [...] "game", <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> don't have a definition, and we don't need one, because even without the definition, we use the word successfully. Everybody understands what we mean when we talk about playing a game, and we can even clearly identify and correct inaccurate uses of the word, all without reference to any definition that consists of necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the concept of a game. The German word for [...] "game", [...] "", has a different sense than in English; the meaning of [...] "Spiele" [...] also extends to the concept of [...] "play" [...] and [...] "playing." [...] This German sense of the word may help readers better understand Wittgenstein's context in the remarks regarding games.|$|E
2500|$|Bono {{described}} the song's theme as such: [...] "It {{is a song}} about coming together, but it's not the old hippie idea of 'Let's all live together.' It is, in fact, the opposite. It's saying, We are one, but we're not the same. It's not saying we even want to get along, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have to get along together in this world {{if it is to}} survive. It's a reminder that we have no choice". The Edge described it on one level as a [...] "bitter, twisted, vitriolic conversation between two people who've been through some nasty, heavy stuff". On another level, he suggested that the line [...] "we get to carry each other" [...] introduces [...] "grace" [...] to the song and that the wording [...] "get to" [...] (instead of [...] "got to") is essential, as it suggests that it is a privilege to help one another, not an obligation. The band have been told by many fans that they played the song at their weddings, prompting Bono to respond, [...] "Are you mad? It's about splitting up!" [...] There was some speculation that the song described a conversation between a father and his HIV-positive gay son, based on the connection of the song to David Wojnarowicz, a gay artist who died of AIDS.|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, Attlee {{opposed the}} Munich Agreement, in which Chamberlain {{negotiated}} with Hitler to give Germany the German-speaking parts of Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland: We all feel relief that war {{has not come}} this time. Every {{one of us has}} been passing through days of anxiety; we cannot, however, feel that peace has been established, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have nothing but an armistice in a state of war. We have been unable to go in for care-free rejoicing. We have felt {{that we are in the}} midst of a tragedy. We have felt humiliation. This has not been a victory for reason and humanity. It has been a victory for brute force. At every stage of the proceedings there have been time limits laid down by the owner and ruler of armed force. The terms have not been terms negotiated; they have been terms laid down as ultimata. We have seen to-day a gallant, civilised and democratic people betrayed and handed over to a ruthless despotism. We have seen something more. We have seen the cause of democracy, which is, in our view, the cause of civilisation and humanity, receive a terrible defeat. ... The events of these last few days constitute one of the greatest diplomatic defeats that this country and France have ever sustained. There can be no doubt that it is a tremendous victory for Herr Hitler. Without firing a shot, by the mere display of military force, he has achieved a dominating position in Europe which Germany failed to win after four years of war. He has overturned the balance of power in Europe. He has destroyed the last fortress of democracy in Eastern Europe which stood in the way of his ambition. He has opened his way to the food, the oil and the resources which he requires in order to consolidate his military power, and he has successfully defeated and reduced to impotence the forces that might have stood against the rule of violence.|$|E
