5|$|During a 2004 {{assessment}} of Texas waterways, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality found {{higher than normal}} levels of bacteria {{at the mouth of}} Carancahua Creek and alkaline pH levels, symptomatic of algal bloom. The issues discovered by the Commission were common in the water bodies examined for the study, and they noted that such issues would <b>be</b> <b>addressed.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} ultimately {{compromised by}} loosening suffrage requirements. It also {{reduced the number}} of delegates and senators to the Virginia General Assembly. The resulting constitution was ratified by a popular majority, though most of the voters {{in the western part of}} the state ended up voting against it. Thus, the underlying intrastate tensions remained, and would have to <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> later.|$|E
5|$|According to {{customary}} law, noblemen {{could not}} be sued outside the province until the 15thcentury. King Louis I even prohibited all prelates and noblemen who owned lands in Transylvania from bringing legal proceedings of lesser importance concerning these estates to the royal court. Nevertheless, legal actions between Transylvanians and the inhabitants of {{other parts of the}} kingdom remained outside the jurisdiction of the voivodes. Litigants could appeal to the royal court against the decision of the voivode from the 14thcentury, but the voivode often remained involved in the proceedings. Legislation prescribed that appeals against decisions of the voivodes were to <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> to the judge royal only from 1444.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{construction}} and reconstruction work resumed on the A3 motorway. The battle damage {{was the first}} to <b>be</b> <b>addressed,</b> along with removal of the trenches excavated in the flyover embankments. Similarly, unexploded ordnance and minefields left around the motorway had to be removed by minesweepers. The motorway pavement was seriously deteriorated, as evidenced by extensive ruts and cracks incurred during the four-year wartime period. Unlike repairs made to the viaducts and flyovers, mine clearance and pavement reconstruction took considerably more time to perform.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} development, {{multiple}} {{members of}} staff voiced dissatisfaction with the final product. Ito and Suzuki felt that the portrayals of the Law and Chaos Heroes were imbalanced, with the Chaos Hero being too emotional and the Law Hero being unsympathetic. They also saw the demon fusion system as too difficult for players to master. Okada, while commenting on what improvements would {{be made for the}} next game, stated that there were too many useless items in the game. Niino felt that the game's pacing and flow needed to <b>be</b> <b>addressed,</b> as after naming the characters, the player immediately is prompted to divide their status points.|$|E
5|$|Despite that, the {{government}} has stated that the issue might <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> if France were to be offered something of equal value. The Council itself has indicated privately that it would discuss the Strasbourg seat only if Parliament gives them a signal to start a debate, as they would not do on their own initiative. However, few wish {{to discuss the issue}} while the current constitutional issues are still present. Although political parties have no formal position, the Greens, Liberals and Socialists are all outspoken on having Brussels as a permanent seat.|$|E

5|$|Individuals with {{breathing}} difficulties due to asthma or allergies may experience additional barriers to quality sleep that can <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> by specific variations of sleep hygiene recommendations. Difficulty with breathing can cause disruptions to sleep, reducing {{the ability to}} stay asleep and to achieve restful sleep. For individuals with allergies or asthma, additional considerations {{must be given to}} potential triggers in the bedroom environment. Medications that might improve ability to breathe while sleeping may also impair sleep in other ways, so there must be careful management of decongestants, asthma controllers, and antihistamines.|$|E
5|$|Jeter {{committed}} 18 {{errors in}} 2007, his highest total since finishing with 24 in 2000. After the season, Cashman {{and his staff}} saw Jeter's defense as an area that needed to <b>be</b> <b>addressed.</b> At the Yankees' request, Jeter embarked on a rigorous training program to combat the effects of age, by focusing on lateral movement and first-step quickness. Jeter's ultimate zone rating (UZR) improved from worst in the AL for shortstops in 2007 to close to league average in 2008.|$|E
5|$|On 3 February 2008, MNS and SP workers {{indulged in}} street {{fighting}} after the former tried {{to attack the}} latter, who were proceeding to Shivaji Park, Dadar, in Mumbai to attend a rally organised by the United National Progressive Alliance (UNPA), the ruling coalition party of India, of which the SP is a member. The rally was to <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> by former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and other prominent members of the UNPA and SP.

5000|$|Another {{format for}} quizzing is called [...] "infinite bounce". This format is {{generally}} used {{when the number}} of teams in the quiz is large - usually around 8-10. Every question <b>is</b> <b>addressed</b> to the team succeeding the team that answered the previous question. If no team answers the question, the next question <b>is</b> <b>addressed</b> to the team succeeding the team to whom the previous question <b>was</b> <b>addressed.</b>|$|R
5|$|Shallow penetration, another {{detriment}} to weld strength, can <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> by decreasing welding speed, {{increasing the}} current or using a smaller electrode. Any of these weld-strength-related defects {{can make the}} weld prone to cracking, but other factors are involved as well. High carbon, alloy or sulfur content in the base material can lead to cracking, especially if low-hydrogen electrodes and preheating are not employed. Furthermore, the workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual stresses into the weld and can cause cracking as the weld cools and contracts.|$|E
5|$|The 747 was {{conceived}} while air travel was increasing in the 1960s. The era of commercial jet transportation, {{led by the}} enormous popularity of the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, had revolutionized long-distance travel. Even before it lost the CX-HLS contract, Boeing was asked by Juan Trippe, president of Pan American World Airways (Pan Am), {{one of their most}} important airline customers, to build a passenger aircraft more than twice the size of the 707. During this time, airport congestion, worsened by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small aircraft, became a problem that Trippe thought could <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> by a larger new aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had {{resulted}} in periods of famine and chronic unemployment, exacerbated {{by the introduction of}} the first of the Corn Laws. By the beginning of 1819, the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the relative lack of suffrage in Northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism. In response, the Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, organised a demonstration to <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> by the well-known radical orator Henry Hunt.|$|E

5|$|The {{first case}} of HIV/AIDS in Malawi was {{reported}} at Lilongwe's Kamuzu Central Hospital in 1985. President Hastings Banda, {{who was in}} power at the time, responded with several small-scale prevention initiatives and created the National AIDS Control Programme, {{a division of the}} Ministry of Health, to manage the growing epidemic. Banda believed that issues relating to sex, including HIV transmission, should not <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> in the public sphere; during this time, it was illegal for Malawian citizens to discuss the epidemic openly. In 1989, Banda introduced a five-year World Bank Medium Term Plan to combat the epidemic, but HIV prevalence had already increased drastically at this point.|$|E
5|$|When {{considering}} the project, Charles Cecil {{played the game}} again and noticed many issues, including pixilated backgrounds, FMV and audio were of poor quality, and he also felt some dialogue was out of place. He thought all these elements could <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> and improved in a remastered edition, {{in which they could}} add a diary, hint system, and new artwork from Dave Gibbons, which they could offer as an interactive digital comic.|$|E
5|$|Where {{medicinal}} plants are harvested {{from the wild}} rather than cultivated, {{they are subject to}} both general and specific threats. General threats include climate change and habitat loss to development and agriculture. A specific threat is over-collection to meet rising demand for medicines. A case in point was the pressure on wild populations of the Pacific yew soon after news of taxol's effectiveness became public. The threats could <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> by cultivation of some {{medicinal plants}}, or by a system of certification to make wild harvesting sustainable.|$|E
