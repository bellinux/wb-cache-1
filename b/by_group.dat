5|$|No. 72 Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) wing that {{operated}} during World WarII. It {{was formed}} in April 1943 at Townsville, Queensland, as part of North-Eastern Area Command. Led <b>by</b> <b>Group</b> Captain Charles Eaton, the wing soon deployed to Merauke, Dutch New Guinea, where it comprised three squadrons flying CAC Boomerang and P-40 Kittyhawk fighters, and A-31 Vengeance dive bombers. Eaton was succeeded <b>by</b> <b>Group</b> Captain Allan Walters in mid-1943. No.72 Wing {{took part in the}} defence of Torres Strait, undertaking interception, patrol and occasional ground-attack and anti-shipping duties. By July 1944, its original squadrons had all been disbanded or transferred to other operational formations. No.120 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron, which had arrived in May 1944, operating Kittyhawks, remained at Merauke until February 1945. The wing headquarters returned to Australia that May, and disbanded the following month.|$|E

5|$|The region, {{as defined}} above, has a total {{population}} of about 5 million. The main disambiguation issue in demographics is the self-identifying name of two contemporary groups.

According to the Greek arguments, the ancient Macedonians' nationality was Greek and thus, {{the use of the}} term on a national level lays claims to their history.

5|$|By {{the evening}} of 4 June, the Allied {{meteorological}} team, headed <b>by</b> <b>Group</b> Captain James Stagg of the Royal Air Force, predicted that the weather would improve sufficiently so that the invasion could go ahead on 6 June. He met Eisenhower and other senior commanders at their headquarters at Southwick House in Hampshire to discuss the situation. General Montgomery and Major General Walter Bedell Smith, Eisenhower's chief of staff, were eager to launch the invasion. Admiral Bertram Ramsay was prepared to commit his ships, while Air Chief Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory {{expressed concern that the}} conditions would be unfavourable for Allied aircraft. After much discussion, Eisenhower decided that the invasion should go ahead. Allied control of the Atlantic meant that German meteorologists did not have access to as much information as the Allies on incoming weather patterns. As the Luftwaffe meteorological centre in Paris predicted two weeks of stormy weather, many Wehrmacht commanders left their posts to attend war games in Rennes, and men in many units were given leave. Marshal Erwin Rommel returned to Germany for his wife's birthday and to meet Hitler to try to get more Panzers.|$|E
5|$|In February 1945, Walters was {{promoted}} to acting air commodore and took over from Air Commodore Lukis as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Northern Command, directing its operations in New Guinea, New Britain and Bougainville {{until the end of}} the war. Headquartered at Madang in Papua New Guinea, Northern Command had previously been a large mobile formation known as No.9 (Operational) Group but had evolved into a garrison force, its mobile function supplanted by No.10 (Operational) Group (later First Tactical Air Force). Northern Command's operational formations included No.71 Wing in northern New Guinea, No.74 Wing at Port Moresby, and No.84 Wing on Bougainville. No.71 Wing, commanded <b>by</b> <b>Group</b> Captain Val Hancock, supported the Australian 6thDivision during the Aitape–Wewak Campaign, despite ordnance deficiencies that at one stage led to its squadrons arming their Bristol Beauforts with captured Japanese bombs. No.84 Wing suffered shortages in pilots and equipment during the Bougainville Campaign, and morale problems following the end of the war owing to inactivity and the uncertainties of demobilisation; as a result, the wing's commanding officer sent Northern Command headquarters a frank report, the tone of which earned a rebuke from Walters. In September, Walters represented the RAAF at the Japanese surrender ceremonies in Wewak.|$|E
5|$|In June–July 1944, No.79 Wing {{supported}} the Allied attack on Noemfoor. No.18 Squadron was again the wing's most active unit, flying 107 sorties. In September, the Beaufighters and Mitchells attacked Japanese shipping and infrastructure in Ceram and Celebes, but lost nine aircraft and twenty-six crewmen killed, among them Squadron Leader Wilbur Wackett, son of Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation manager Lawrence Wackett. By {{the end of}} the month, Mitchell missions were put on hold while replacement crews were trained. In late 1944, plans were made to transfer No.79 Wing from North-Western Area Command to Northern Command in Papua New Guinea, where it would undertake operations against the Japanese in New Britain. The wing's composition for this move was to be Nos.2 and 18 Squadrons, operating Mitchells, and 120 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron, operating P-40 Kittyhawks. No.31 Squadron was transferred from No.79 Wing to the Australian First Tactical Air Force at Morotai in December. The same month, Group Captain Eaton posted out and was replaced <b>by</b> <b>Group</b> Captain John Ryland.|$|E

5|$|No. 79 Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) wing of World WarII. It {{was formed}} in December 1943 at Batchelor, Northern Territory, as part of North-Western Area Command. Led <b>by</b> <b>Group</b> Captain Charles Eaton, the wing {{comprised}} four squadrons on its establishment, flying Beaufort and B-25 Mitchell bombers and Beaufighter heavy fighters. No.79 Wing {{took part in the}} New Guinea and North-Western Area Campaigns during 1944–45, eventually transferring to Balikpapan in the Dutch East Indies as the Allies advanced northward. By the end of the Pacific War, the wing was attached to the Australian First Tactical Air Force and was made up of Nos.2 and 18 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadrons, both flying Mitchells. The latter transferred to the Netherlands Air Force in late 1945, while the former returned to Australia where it disbanded the following year. No.79 Headquarters itself disbanded in October 1945, soon after the end of hostilities.|$|E
5|$|The F-111C entered Australian service {{after the}} {{technical}} problems were resolved, {{and the first}} F-111C was accepted at Nellis Air Force Base on 15 March 1973. On 31 March, the RAAF Washington Flying Unit was formed at McClellan Air Force Base in California with the mission of ferrying the first 12 F-111Cs to Australia. This unit was commanded <b>by</b> <b>Group</b> Captain John Newham, who later served as Chief of the Air Staff between 1985 and 1988. The RAAF's first six F-111Cs arrived at Amberley on 1 July 1973, and three subsequent groups of six F-111s arrived on 27 July, 28 September and 4 December. F-111Cs were allocated to No. 1 Squadron and No. 6 Squadron, {{under the control of}} No. 82 Wing. No. 1 Squadron was the RAAF's strike squadron, and maintained a nominal strength of 12 F-111s. No. 6 Squadron mainly served as the F-111 operational conversion unit, though it also operated the RF-111 aircraft at times and could serve in the strike role if required. Once in RAAF service, all F-111 maintenance was undertaken at Amberley. From 1973 to 2001 No. 482 Squadron conducted intermediate maintenance of the aircraft, while heavy maintenance was the responsibility of No. 3 Aircraft Depot. No. 482 Squadron also operated the RAAF's F-111 flight simulator. From 2001 onwards, Boeing Australia performed all F-111 maintenance under a contract with the Australian government.|$|E

No. 11 Group moved to RAF Martlesham Heath on 14 April 1958 and the room was soon sealed in its original condition. The memorial was unveiled by Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding on 23 April 1958 in a ceremony attended <b>by</b> <b>Group</b> Captain Douglas Bader and Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, among others, and marked by a flypast of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. Control of RAF Hillingdon passed from Fighter Command to Technical Training Command that year, at which time the entire site became known as RAF Uxbridge. The RAF School of Education moved into Hillingdon House from RAF Spitalgate on 10 November 1958, and the station was subsequently merged with No. 22 Group RAF.|$|E
