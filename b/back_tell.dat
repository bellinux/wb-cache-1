500|$|Derrickson and Marvel had {{originally}} discussed him writing the film alongside his Sinister co-writer C. Robert Cargill, with Derrickson also directing, but Marvel {{felt that they}} would not be able to reach their intended release date of July 2016 if Derrickson filled both roles. When Derrickson was chosen as director, Marvel passed on Cargill as an individual writer, with Jon Spaihts hired to rewrite the script instead. Spaihts, a big fan of Doctor Strange as a child, had started [...] "pestering" [...] Marvel as soon as he read reports of the company searching for a director for the film. This eventually led to him meeting with the studio, before they actually began looking for writers for the film. Spaihts said that they talked [...] "all afternoon, and the fit was right", but he received a call from Marvel several days later saying that they were not completely sure they wanted to take the film in the same direction as Spaihts, and were going to look at other writers. Spaihts told his agent to not [...] "take that answer. Call them <b>back,</b> <b>tell</b> them there’s a lot of right answers, and get me back in the room", and after talking with Marvel for [...] "another three or four hours" [...] he was given the job. Marvel never seriously looked at any other writer for the film. Derrickson was already hired when Spaihts joined, and the pair spent several months working on the film's story with Feige and executive producer Stephen Broussard. They started writing the film from the beginning, and initially were unsure whether it would be an origin story, or if it would begin with Strange already as a [...] "fully-formed" [...] sorcerer. Spaihts ultimately felt that [...] "the origin story of this character, as depicted in the comics, is so operatic and beautiful, and so tragic and epic in its sweep, that it was unavoidable. We had to tell that story, and tell our best version of it." [...] Elements from Spaihts' early drafts that he later stated were still in the final film include many of the film's set pieces, such as the climactic battle, which came straight from Derrickson, as well as [...] "little things" [...] from Spaihts, [...] "like a bandaged hand running down a row of prayer bells in a Nepalese temple." [...] Derrickson wanted Nightmare to be the film's antagonist, along with the concept of [...] "nightmares themselves as being a dimension", but Feige felt [...] "getting across the idea of the Dream Dimension as another dimension" [...] would have been challenging alongside everything else that the film introduces. Dormammu, [...] "the most present villain in the comics", became the film's main villain.|$|E
