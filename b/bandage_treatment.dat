40|$|AbstractIntroductionSquamous cell {{carcinoma}} (SCC) {{is the second}} most common form of skin cancer in the United States. The efficacy of a pharmaceutically elegant radiotherapeutic bandage, previously described by us for application against SCC of the skin, was tested {{for the first time in}} vivo using a subcutaneous SCC mouse model and a therapeutically relevant radiation dose. MethodsFemale athymic nude mice were injected with human Colo- 16 SCC cells subcutaneously and after eight days (average tumor volume: 35 ± 8. 6 mm 3) received no treatment, or were exposed to non-radioactive or radioactive (92. 5 ± 18. 5 MBq) bandages for approximately 1 h (n= 10 per group). After treatment, tumors were measured over fifteen days, tumor volume ratios (TVRs) compared and histopathology performed. ResultsFifteen days after treatment, the TVR of the radioactive <b>bandage</b> <b>treatment</b> group was 3. 3 ± 4. 5, while TVRs of the non-radioactive <b>bandage</b> <b>treatment</b> and no treatment control groups were 33. 2 ± 14. 7 and 26. 9 ± 12. 6, respectively. At the time of necropsy, there was mild focal epidermal hyperplasia surrounding a small area of epidermal ulceration in the radioactive bandage group. No other examined tissue (i. e., muscle, liver, kidney, lung, spleen and heart) showed significant lesions. ConclusionsOur radiotherapeutic bandage exhibits promising efficacy against SCC of the skin in a mouse model. It can be individually tailored for easy application on tumor lesions of all shapes and sizes, and could complement or possibly replace surgery in the clinic...|$|E
40|$|Aims and objective.   The {{negative}} impact of chronic leg ulcers on {{quality of life is}} well documented. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effectiveness of a new community nursing model of care on quality of life, morale, depression, self-esteem, social support, healing, pain and functional ability of clients with chronic venous leg ulcers. Background.   Venous leg ulcers are slow to heal, frequently recur and are associated with pain, restricted mobility and decreased quality of life. Although chronic wound care consumes a large proportion of community nursing time and health care resources, there is little evidence available on the effectiveness of differing models of community care for this population. Design.   Randomised controlled trial. Methods.   We recruited a sample of 67 participants with venous leg ulcers referred for care to a community nursing organisation in Queensland, Australia after obtaining informed consent. Participants were randomised to either the Lindsay Leg Club® model of care (n = 34), emphasising socialisation and peer support; or the traditional community nursing model (n = 33) consisting of individual home visits by a registered nurse. Participants in both groups were treated by a core team of nurses using identical research protocols based on short-stretch compression <b>bandage</b> <b>treatment.</b> Data were collected at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks from commencement. Results.   Participants who received care under the Leg Club model demonstrated significantly improved outcomes in quality of life (p = 0 · 014), morale (p < 0 · 001), self-esteem (p = 0 · 006), healing (p = 0 · 004), pain (p = 0 · 003) and functional ability (p = 0 · 044). Conclusion.   In this sample, the evaluation of the Leg Club model of care shows potential to improve the health and well-being of clients who have chronic leg ulcers. Relevance to clinical practice.   These results suggest further evaluation and implementation of this model is warranted by community health organisations involved in the care of this population...|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. (Chiropractic) Chronic {{lower back}} pain (LBP) is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most prevalent conditions in our society with 70 - 85 % of the population experiencing pain at some point in their lives and 80 % having recurrent episodes. The majority of chronic LBP is treated with conservative care, with spinal manipulation being a treatment modality shown to be beneficial resulting in restoration of normal ranges of movement, decrease of muscle spasm and there is an overall biomechanical change. One of the more modern trends is combining manipulation with taping. It has been shown that with the application of Kinesio tape to the lumbar para-spinal muscles effectively increases lumbar range of motion and decreases pain with the relaxation of tense muscles as well as increase in proprioception as the tape increasingly stimulates cutaneous mechanoreceptors. Elastic bandage has been shown to improve proprioceptive acuity as it stimulates cutaneous mechanoreceptors, as well as providing support to joint structure. The purpose of this study was to determine the superiority of one tape versus the other as well as the efficacy of the individual tape and whether the combination treatment of spinal manipulative therapy and taping of the lumbar paraspinal muscles are possibly a more effective treatment protocol in the treatment of chronic lower back pain. Method: This clinical study was a comparative study and consisted of two groups of fifteen participants who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The participants were between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years of age. Group 1 was treated with lumbar spine and sacroiliac joint adjustments and the application of Kinesio tape. Group 2 was treated with lumbar spine and sacroiliac joint adjustments and the application of elastic <b>bandage.</b> <b>Treatment</b> took place over a period of three weeks and participants were treated six times out of a total of seven consultations. Procedure: Subjective data was recorded at the first and fourth consultation prior to treatment and on the seventh consultation by means of a Numerical Pain Rating Scale and an Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire to assess pain and disability. Objective data was recorded at the first and fourth consultation prior to treatment and on the seventh consultation by means of a digital inclinometer for assessing lumbar spine range of motion. Data recorded was analyzed by a statistician. Results: Clinically and statistically significant improvements were noted in both groups over the course of the study with regards to pain, disability and lumbar spine range of motion. Conclusion: The results show that both combination treatments of spinal manipulative therapy and the application of Kinesio™ tape or elastic adhesive bandage are effective treatment protocols, both clinical and statistical in decreasing pain, disability and improving lumbar range of motion in patients with chronic lower back pain. However neither treatment protocols proved to be superior over the other...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo examine {{patient and}} wound {{variables}} presumed to influence healing outcomes {{in the context}} of therapeutic trials for chronic venous leg ulcers. MethodsThis double-blind, vehicle-controlled study was conducted with randomized assignment to one of four cell therapy dose groups (n = 46, 43, 44, 45) or vehicle control (n = 50). A 2 -week run-in period was used to exclude rapid healers and those with infection or uncontrolled edema. This was a multicenter (ambulatory, private, hospital-based and university-based practices, and wound care centers in North America) study. Adults ≥ 18 years old with chronic venous insufficiency associated with an uninfected venous leg ulcer (2 - 12 cm 2 area, 6 - 104 weeks' duration) were included in the study. Excluded were pregnant or lactating women, wounds with exposed muscle, tendon or bone, patients unable to tolerate compression bandages, or patients who had exclusionary medical conditions or exposure to certain products. Exclusion during run-in included patients with infection, uncontrolled severe edema or with healing rates ≥ 0. 349 cm/ 2 wk. Screen fail rate was 37 % (134 / 362), and the withdrawal rate was ∼ 10 % (23 of 228). Growth-arrested neonatal dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes were delivered via pump spray in a fibrin sealant-based matrix, plus a foam dressing and four-layer compression <b>bandaging.</b> <b>Treatment</b> continued for 12 weeks or until healed, whichever occurred first. Patient demographic and wound-related variables were evaluated for influence on complete wound healing in all patients, as well as the subsets of treated and control patients. ResultsWound duration (P =. 004) and the presence of specific quantities of certain bacterial species (P <. 001) affected healing in the vehicle group, while healing in the cell-treated groups was influenced by wound duration (P =. 012), wound area (P =. 026), wound location (P =. 011), and specific quantities of certain bacterial species (P =. 002). Age, sex, race, diabetes, HbA 1 C, peripheral neuropathy, and serum prealbumin did not significantly affect healing. Body mass index was positively associated with healing in cell-treated patients. ConclusionsWound duration is a quantifiable surrogate for one or more undefined variables that can have a profound negative effect on venous leg ulcer healing. Although cell therapy overcame barriers to healing, the only specific barrier identified was the presence of certain bacterial species. Interventional trials of potentially effective new therapies can be most informative when patients with suspected barriers to healing are included. The specific measurement of candidate barriers such as microbial pathogens, wound inflammatory state, and fibroblast function should be considered in future randomized trials to improve our understanding of the basis for chronicity...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe aim was {{to explore}} the current {{experience}} and practice of vascular surgeons in the United Kingdom and Ireland regarding foam sclerotherapy for varicose veins. MethodA postal questionnaire was sent to 609 members of the Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland. ResultsThere were 281 responses (47 %). Seventy surgeons (25 %) used foam sclerotherapy. Most use it selectively; few (29 %) offer it to all patients. It {{was more likely to}} be used for recurrent varices (71 %), in older patients (61 %) and for smaller non-saphenous varices (67 %). The majority of surgeons (69 %) used sodium tetradecyl sulphate and up to a maximum of 10 – 12 ml of foam. The majority used ultrasound guidance (95 %), leg elevation (69 %) and direct pressure over the saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junction during injection (63 %). Eighty per cent used compression <b>bandaging</b> after <b>treatment,</b> usually for 7 days (44 %). Ninety percent advised compression stockings, usually Class II (64 %) for 14 days (39 %).

40|$|The main aims of {{this study}} were to examine the wood {{substrate}} degrading capacities of microorganisms isolated from soft-rotted CCA-treated Eucalyptus sp. power transmission poles in ground contact, and to evaluate techniques for assessment of the degree of wood degradation caused by microbial attack. The performances of various wood preservatives, including remedial and ground-line maintenance treatment systems for poles, were assessed. The predominant organism isolated from Tasmanian woods in this study, the Hyphomycete Phialophora mutabiIis, had demonstrable celIuIase, hemicelIulase, amylase and pectic enzyme activities as well as a measurable wood-degrading capacity. Trichoderma viride was a highly cellulolytic fungus in pure culture, and a dominant early coloniser of untreated E. obIiqua wood in ground contact. However, it produced minimal wood degradation in this examination. A small (< 10 4 cel I s/g wood sawdust) bacterial microflora was found in untreated and preservative-treated hardwoods. Bacterial isolates possessed a number of wood-degrading enzymes: A strain of Bacillus megaterium (S 9 NC) isolated in this study, showed cel I ulase, xy I anase, amylase and pectic enzyme activities, whilst CelIulomonas sp. 8 N produced at least one celIuIase, xyIanase, pectic enzyme and Iaccase. However, no definite degradation of intact E. obIiqua sapwood cell walls by pure cultures of bacteria was observed by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Fungi (including Basidiomycetes) and bacteria were earl y colonizers of untreated E. obliqua stakes in the ground. A mutual istic relationship, albeit not a close one, was demonstrated between propagule counts of fungi and bacteria, isolated from CCA-treated Eucalyptus sp. sawdusts. Two techniques for estimating microbial activity in wood samples were developed in this study, and compared with other methods for estimating the degree of wood degradation. The methods were: i. a Cx-celIuIase assay i i. a modified and improved chitin assay for estimation of fungal biomass in wood. Appropriate parameters for both assay methods were determined. The Cx-celIuIase and chi tin assays were relatively quick and sensitive methods for assessing the degree of microbial attack of woods. These assay procedures, plus impaction determinations using the Pilodyne(R) instrument, and to a much lesser extent the fungal propaguIe count, were largely objective procedures. Visual and microscopic estimates of wood degradation were found to be highly subjective in this study. Several field trials of wood preservatives were used to compare the newly developed assay methods with fungal propagule counts, Pilodyne(R) impaction determinations, and visual and microscopic estimates of wood degradation. The trial s examined were remedial treatments of transmission poles at Warrane, Tasmania, and <b>bandage</b> <b>treatments</b> of poles at Grafton, N. S. W. and Coff 's Harbour, N. S. W. In addition, an E. obliqua preservative-treated sapwood stake trial was emplaced at Grove, Tasmania.

40|$|Compression bandaging {{improves}} {{rates of}} healing {{in people with}} venous ulceration. Some ulcers appear resistant to compression therapy and may benefit from adjunctive therapy. Pentoxifylline is known to improve circulation, but individual trials have failed to conclusively demonstrate its effectiveness in venous ulceration. The objective of this meta-analysis {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of pentoxifylline as an adjunct to compression <b>bandaging</b> in the <b>treatment</b> of venous leg ulcers. The CENTRAL registers of the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases and Wounds Groups were searched - each register is routinely updated by extensive searches of electronic databases, handsearching of relevant journals and conference proceedings, and contact with product companies and experts in the field. The drug's manufacturer was contacted and the references of review articles and all obtained trials were scrutinised for further citations. Randomised controlled trials published in any language comparing pentoxifylline and compression with placebo in adult participants with venous ulceration were included. Trials must have reported a meaningful objective outcome (rates of healing, proportions healed, time to healing). Details from eligible trials (independently selected by two reviewers) were extracted and summarised by one reviewer. A second reviewer independently verified extracted data. Eleven clinical trials were identified. Five trials compared pentoxifylline with placebo (compression standard therapy). Six trials were excluded. Pentoxifylline and compression was more effective than placebo and compression (RR 1. 30, 95 % C 1 1. 10 - 1. 54) and was robust to sensitivity analyses. The greater number of adverse effects (46 reports) occurred in the pentoxifylline group, although this was not significant (RR 1. 12, 95 % C 1 0. 77 - 1. 62); 34 percent of adverse effects were gastro-intestinal. Seven of 21 reported withdrawals were for adverse effects. In conclusion, pentoxifylline appears an effective adjunct to compression <b>bandaging</b> in the <b>treatment</b> of venous ulcers. The absence of cost-effectiveness data suggests it not be employed as a routine adjunct, but it could be considered as for those patients not responding to compression therapy alone. The majority of adverse effects are likely to be tolerated by patients...|$|R

40|$|Congenital {{false joint}} of shin occurs in 1 case per 28 000 - 190 000 live births, {{but it is}} hard-to-treat and {{disabling}} disease. Objective: Improving treatment outcomes, {{reducing the number of}} surgical interventions for the treatment of congenital false joint of shin. Materials and Methods. The method is carried out using staged plaster casts with the gradual correction of deformities. When axis of the leg approximates to the normal one, axial load is added. First, it is done by tapping on the heel. When the child was 7 - 8 months old he was put on the legs and taught to walk. The plaster bandage is replaced by "Scotch cast" and "soft cast" <b>bandage.</b> The <b>treatment</b> lasted up to reaching of clinical effect – correction of shin deformation and absence of pathological mobility. Clinical effect must be confirmed by roentgenography which must demonstrate filling of false joint zone with bone tissue and restoration of intramedullary canal. During all the period of treating alternate courses of electrophoresis with calcium chloride, medical mud extracts and magnetic therapy are conducted. In the period from 1995 till 2015 in the Regional Zaporizhzhia Children Clinical Hospital 4 children (6 shins) aged from 1 to 7 months with false joint of shin were treated using proposed method. Results and discussion. All 4 children (6 shins) treated in clinic with proposed conservative method showed filling of false joint zone with bone tissue, restoration of intramedullary canal and significant extension of axis of the shin. The load on the leg in early terms results in compression of bone fragments (as in compression-distraction osteosynthesis), magnetic therapy, electrophoresis with calcium chloride and medical mud extracts promote active functioning of the muscles that improves regional blood supply and improves osteogenesis. Conclusions. Using the proposed method of treatment of congenital false joint of shins in newborns and infants can allow avoiding surgical intervention and disability of the child. The problem of congenital shin false joint treatment in children is not fully settled and needs further study and solution. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Functional {{bandages}} {{have been}} used in physiotherapeutic practice with the purpose of minimizing disabilities and favoring functional improvement. However, there is still a shortage of research regarding the use of these devices in patients with neurological sequelae, especially those resulting from stroke. Objective To report the motor evolution of patients living with sequelae of stroke, who have been submitted to the use of functional bandages associated with conventional physical therapy. Materials and methods We assessed the active range of motion, strength and degree of spasticity in the flexor and extensor muscles of the wrist and elbow joints, and functionality of the upper limb during the performance of daily activities at the first and the twentieth session of conventional physical therapy {{associated with the use of}} functional bandages. Results There was an increase in range of motion and muscle strength of patients, and reduction in spasticity of the wrist and elbow flexor muscles. Conversely, the functionality scores remained similar before and after treatment. Conclusion The subjects of this study showed a good evolution in the aspects studied. Thus, the use of functional bandages associated with conventional physical therapy seems to contribute to the rehabilitation of patients with stroke sequelae.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{proportion}} {{and rate of}} healing, pain, {{and quality of life}} of low-strength medical compression stockings (MCS) with traditional bandages applied for the treatment of recalcitrant venous leg ulcers. METHODS: A single-center, randomized, open-label study was performed with consecutive patients. Sigvaris prototype MCS providing 15 mm Hg- 25 mm Hg at the ankle were compared with multi-layer short-stretch bandages. In both groups, pads were placed above incompetent perforating veins in the ulcer area. The initial static pressure between the dressing-covered ulcer and the pad was 29 mm Hg and 49 mm Hg with MCS and bandages, respectively. Dynamic pressure measurements showed no difference. Compression was maintained day and night and changed every week. The primary endpoint was healing within 90 days. Secondary endpoints were healing within 180 days, time to healing, pain (weekly Likert scales), and monthly quality of life (ChronIc Venous Insufficiency Quality of Life [CIVIQ] questionnaire). RESULTS: Of 74 patients screened, 60 fulfilled the selection criteria and 55 completed the study; 28 in the MCS and 27 in the bandage group. Ulcers were recurrent (48 %), long lasting (mean, 27 months), and large (mean, 13 cm 2). All but one patient had deep venous reflux and/or incompetent perforating veins in addition to trunk varices. Characteristics of patients and ulcers were evenly distributed (exception: more edema in the MCS group; P =. 019). Healing within 90 days was observed in 36 % with MCS and in 48 % with bandages (P =. 350). Healing within 180 days was documented in 50 % with MCS and in 67 % with bandages (P =. 210). Time to healing was identical. Pain scored 44 and 46 initially (on a scale in which 100 referred to maximum and 0 to no pain) and decreased within the first week to 20 and 28 in the MCS and bandage groups, respectively (P <. 001 vs. 010). Quality of life showed no difference between the treatment groups. In both groups, pain at 90 days had decreased by half, independent of completion of healing. Physical, social, and psychic impairment improved significantly in patients with healed ulcers only. CONCLUSION: Our study illustrates the difficulty of bringing large and long-standing venous ulcers to heal. The effect of compression with MCS was not different from that of compression with <b>bandages.</b> Both <b>treatments</b> alleviated pain promptly. Quality of life was improved only in patients whose ulcers had healed...|$|R
40|$|Background Drawbacks exist {{with the}} {{standard}} <b>treatment</b> (four-layer compression <b>bandages)</b> for venous leg ulcers. We have therefore compared the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two-layer compression hosiery with the four-layer <b>bandage</b> for the <b>treatment</b> of such ulcers. Methods We undertook this pragmatic, open, randomised controlled trial with two parallel groups in 34 centres in England and Northern Ireland. The centres were community nurse teams or services, family doctor practices, leg ulcer clinics, tissue viability clinics or services, and wound clinics. Participants were aged 18 years or older with a venous leg ulcer and an ankle brachial pressure index of at least 0 · 8, and were tolerant of high compression. We randomly allocated participants (1 : 1) to receive two-layer compression hosiery or a four-layer bandage, using a remote randomisation service and prevalidated computer randomisation program. Participants were stratified by ulcer duration and ulcer area with permuted blocks (block sizes four and six). The primary endpoint was time to ulcer healing, with a maximum follow-up of 12 months. Although participants and health-care providers were not masked to treatment allocation, the primary endpoint was measured by masked assessment of photographs. Primary analysis was intention to treat with Cox regression, with adjustment for ulcer area, ulcer duration, physical mobility, and centre. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN register, number ISRCTN 49373072. Findings We randomly allocated 457 participants to the two treatment groups: 230 to two-layer hosiery and 227 to the four-layer bandage, of whom 453 (230 hosiery and 223 bandage) contributed data for analysis. Median time to ulcer healing was 99 days (95...|$|R
40|$|Venous Leg Ulceration (VLU) is {{a chronic}} {{condition}} for which healthcare systems worldwide face rising treatment costs. VLU can {{be due to}} sustained venous hypertension which causes the veins to become cuffed with fibrin, inhibiting the supply of nutrients to the wound site. For patients that cannot tolerate compression therapy with an inelastic short stretch (SS) <b>bandage,</b> the mainstay <b>treatment,</b> an elastic three layered (3 L) bandage is an alternative. In this paper, a mathematical model is developed to investigate whether the healing of venous ulcers under SS and 3 L bandages occurs at different rates and to postulate the reason for any difference. The two treatments were applied to a simplified wound geometry, {{under the assumption that}} the rate limiting step of healing is the supply of oxygen to the wounded tissue. Clinical data of wound size over time under the two treatments from Weller et al. (2012) was used to fit key, unknown, model parameters using a least squares approach. Numerical results are presented for the oxygen distribution within the wound space, using the fitted parameter values. The 3 L bandage allows more oxygen flow into the wound than the SS bandage and, hence, the 3 L bandage results in faster healing, however the difference is more significant for wounds of larger initial size. The model {{can be used as a}} predictive tool in a clinical setting to estimate the time to heal for a wound of a given initial size, treated with either a SS or 3 L bandage...|$|R
40|$|This {{trial was}} {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} safety and efficacy of four-layer compared with short stretch compression <b>bandages</b> for the <b>treatment</b> of venous leg ulcers {{within the confines of}} a prospective, randomised, ethically approved trial. Fifty-three patients were recruited from a dedicated venous ulcer assessment clinic and their individual ulcerated limbs were randomised to receive either a four-layer bandage (FLB) (n = 32) or a short stretch bandage (SSB) (n = 32). The endpoint was a completely healed ulcer. However, if after 12 weeks of compression therapy no healing had been achieved, that limb was withdrawn from the study and deemed to have failed to heal with the prescribed bandage. Leg volume was measured using the multiple disc model at the first bandaging visit, 4 weeks later, and on ulcer healing. Complications arising during the study were recorded. Data from all limbs were analysed on an intention to treat basis; thus the three limbs not completing the protocol were included in the analysis. Of the 53 patients, 50 completed the protocol. At 1 year the healing rate was FLB 55 % and SSB 57 % (chi 2 = 0. 0, df = 1, P = 1. 0). Limbs in the FLB arm of the study sustained one minor complication, whereas SSB limbs sustained four significant complications. Leg volumes reduced significantly after 4 weeks of compression, but subsequent volume changes were insignificant. Ulcer healing rates were not influenced by the presence of deep venous reflux, post-thrombotic deep vein changes nor by ulcer duration. Although larger ulcers took longer to heal, the overall healing rates for large (> 10 cm 2) and small (10 cm 2 or less) ulcers were comparable. Four-layer and short stretch bandages were equally efficacious in healing venous ulcers independent of pattern of venous reflux, ulcer area or duration. FLB limbs sustained fewer complications than SSB...|$|R
