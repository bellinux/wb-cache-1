40|$|The back {{bias voltage}} on a {{functional}} circuit is controlled through a closed loop process. A <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> receives a clock pulse and produces a delay output. The <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> is advantageously constructed {{of the same}} materials as the functional circuit so that the aging and degradation of the <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> parallels the degradation of the functional circuit. As the <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> degrades, the transistor switching time increases, increasing the time delay of the delay output. An AND gate compares a clock pulse to an output pulse of the <b>delay</b> <b>element,</b> the AND output forming a control pulse. A duty cycle of the control pulse {{is determined by the}} delay time between the clock pulse and the <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> output. The control pulse is received at the input of a charge pump. The charge pump produces a back bias voltage which is then applied to the <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> and to the functional circuit. If the time delay produced by the <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> exceeds the optimal delay, the duty cycle of the control pulse is shortened, and the back bias voltage is lowered, thereby increasing the switching speed of the transistors in the <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> and reducing the time delay. If the throughput of the <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> is too fast, the duty cycle of the control pulse is lengthened, raising the back bias voltage produced by the charge pump. This, in turn, lowers the switching speed of the transistors in both the <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> and the functional circuit. The slower switching speed in the <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> increases time <b>delay.</b> In this manner, the switching speed of the <b>delay</b> <b>element,</b> and of the functional circuit, is maintained at a constant level {{over the life of the}} circuit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> {{insensitive}} to power supply and temperature variations become important as circuit speeds increase. A <b>delay</b> <b>element,</b> {{based on a}} CMOS thyristor, is proposed in this paper. This thyristor uses current rather than voltage to control the delay, exhibiting a low power supply noise sensitivity of 9. 43 % and a temperature variation sensitivity of 314 PPM/°C. A technique to cancel the charge sharing effect during switching is incorporated into the <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> to further enhance power supply insensitivity. The <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> is combined with a bandgap reference voltage generator to produce a digitally controlled variable delay line. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> has a lower power supply and temperature sensitivity than a classical chain of inverters. The power consumed by the proposed <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> is lower than an inverter chain, and is much lower than a differential <b>delay</b> <b>element.</b> I...|$|R
30|$|It is {{summarized}} {{that the}} <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> are the fundamental {{building blocks for}} the CMOS delay lines. For delay-tuning functions, {{there are two main}} strategies which are changing the drive strength of the <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> and load-increasing strategy. Analog-tunable <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> are the recommended choice when high-resolution delay step, low jitter, good intrinsic calibration for PVT variations and good stability are considered together in the design. Apart from analog-controlled <b>delay</b> <b>elements,</b> digitally-controlled <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> are also being developed as they offer robustness and simplicity when it comes to design and delay control. The next section discusses these circuits in detail.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Variable <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> {{are often}} used to {{manipulate}} the rising or falling edges of the clock or any other signal in integrated circuits (ICs). <b>Delay</b> <b>elements</b> are also used in delay locked loops (DLLs). Variable <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> have many applications in VLSI circuits. They are extensively used in digital delay locked loops phase locked loops (PLLs), digitally controlled oscillators (DCOs), and microprocessor and memory circuits. In all these circuits, the variable <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> {{is one of the}} key building blocks. Its precision directly affects the overall performance of the circuit. In this a new proposed digitally controlled <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> is implemented in 130 nm technology for DLL Delay locked loop for higher clock rates greater than 2. 5 GHz.

30|$|It is {{summarized}} that, like analog-tunable <b>delay</b> <b>elements,</b> digitally-controlled <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> {{can also}} produce high-resolution delay steps {{according to the}} current ratio relationship of Eq. (3). However, the main challenge with these <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> is in realizing uniform linear delay steps/increments. This {{is because of the}} change in the complex parasitic capacitance of the digitally-controlled transistors responsible for delay tuning when these transistors are turned ON and OFF. This challenge is mainly noticed with the variable-resistor array <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> (Zhang and Kaneko 2015; Maymandi-Nejad and Sachdev 2005). Nonetheless, this drawback may not be applied provided that proper design techniques are utilized, as in the case with the digitally-controlled SCI <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> implemented by (Miao et al. 2015) which has shown to produce fine and linear delay steps within a relatively wide delay range. The digitally-controlled <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> have the upper hand when good process portability, short design time, simple and robust design, and good power management are considered together in the design.|$|R
5000|$|A common {{strategy}} is to realize a higher-order (greater than 2) digital filter as a cascaded series of second-order [...] "biquadratric" [...] (or [...] "biquad") sections (see digital biquad filter). The advantage of this strategy is that the coefficient range is limited. Cascading direct form II sections results in N <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> for filters of order N. Cascading direct form I sections results in N + 2 <b>delay</b> <b>elements,</b> since the <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> of the input of any section (except the first section) are redundant with the <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> of {{the output of the}} preceding section.|$|R
30|$|Fine delay control {{according}} to current ratio relationship of Eq. (3) {{can also be}} attained with digitally-controlled <b>delay</b> <b>elements.</b> However, this might be achieved but {{at the cost of}} linearity degradation as the complex parasitic capacitance of the digitally-controlled transistors changes when the transistors are turned ON and OFF (Maymandi-Nejad and Sachdev 2005). Furthermore, the jitter performance of the digitally-controlled <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> is not as fine as that of the analog-tunable <b>delay</b> <b>elements.</b> This is because that for a high-resolution digital delay line, if the controller always switches the control code of the delay line, the jitter performance will not be good. Alternatively, digitally-controlled <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> have wider range as well as simpler control of delay regulation, simpler and more robust design, lower power consumption, and better process portability than analog-tunable <b>delay</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|R

30|$|This architecture, {{also called}} fixed-delay line, {{makes use of}} N {{identical}} <b>delay</b> <b>elements.</b> Each <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> is connected in series. The output is tapped out at each stage using a switch. Depending on the required delay step, the <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> may be designed using static logic gates or flip-flops (Rahkonen and Kostamovaara 1993; Abas et al. 2007 a; Alahmadi 2013). The finest delay step {{is limited to the}} propagation delay of a single <b>delay</b> <b>element,</b> depending on the speed of the CMOS technology used (Nuyts et al. 2013; Henzler 2010 b). The delay range is approximately equal to the product of the finest delay step by the number of delay stages (Alahmadi 2013).|$|R
30|$|Unlike the tapped delay line, a single-output delay line, as {{its name}} suggests, has only one output. The ability to adjust the desired output signal’s time delay is done either through an analog or digital signal {{depending}} on the type of <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> used. Usually, if a current-starved <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> (Maymandi-Nejad and Sachdev 2003) or shunt-capacitor <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> (Andreani et al. 1999) is used, a digital input word is required to change the delay. On the other hand, if an analog differential buffer (Nuyts et al. 2014; Maneatis 1996) or a MOS diode-based <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> (Markovic et al. 2013) is used, an analog signal is required. More on these types of delay circuits and other types will be discussed in the next two sections.|$|R
