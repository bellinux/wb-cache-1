40|$|For {{decades the}} Hong Kong {{construction}} {{industry has been}} characterized by a stressful work environment and with a poor safety record. Construction personnel under prolonged job stress {{are more prone to}} making errors which can eventually lead to fatal construction accidents. Further, the job burnout experienced by construction personnel can reveal the linkage with safety performance. This study aims to investigate the impact of job burnout experienced by construction managers on safety performance. Thirty senior construction personnel attended the semi-structured interviews and each delivered a detailed account rich enough to be considered to be a case study. The findings from the interviews indicate that the effect of job burnout on safety performance is mixed and complex. Job burnout has a direct effect, no effect or an indirect effect through some mediators on safety performance. The level of involvement of individual staff and reliability of the work system also affect the degree of the linkage. Generally the contractor staff feel more stressful particularly when fatigue is an issue. Social aspects such as bureaucratization of the safety management system, under-evaluation of the contribution from safety personnel, and rivalry manoeuvring have an adverse effect. Good working relationships, quality of workforce and company organisational culture are dilutions to the <b>burnout</b> <b>effect.</b> It is worth noting that an individual’s ability to dilute and accept the <b>burnout</b> <b>effect</b> {{plays a key role in}} the final reaction.

40|$|Burnout is {{prevalent}} in residency training and practice and {{is linked to}} medical error and suboptimal patient care. However, {{little is known about}} how burnout affects clinical reasoning, which is essential to safe and effective care. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine how burnout modulates brain activity during clinical reasoning in physicians. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), brain activity was assessed in internal medicine residents (n = 10) and board-certified internists (faculty, n = 17) from the Uniformed Services University (USUHS) while they answered and reflected upon United States Medical Licensing Examination and American Board of Internal Medicine multiple-choice questions. Participants also completed a validated two-item burnout scale, which includes an item assessing emotional exhaustion and an item assessing depersonalization. Whole brain covariate analysis was used to examine blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal during answering and reflecting upon clinical problems with respect to burnout scores. Higher depersonalization scores were associated with less BOLD signal in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and middle frontal gyrus during reflecting on clinical problems and less BOLD signal in the bilateral precuneus while answering clinical problems in residents. Higher emotional exhaustion scores were associated with more right posterior cingulate cortex and middle frontal gyrus BOLD signal in residents. Examination of faculty revealed no significant influence of burnout on brain activity. Residents appear to be more susceptible to <b>burnout</b> <b>effects</b> on clinical reasoning, which may indicate that residents may need both cognitive and emotional support to improve quality of life and to optimize performance and learning.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} for modeling prepayment rates of individual pools of mortgages. The model incorporates the empirical evidence that prepayment is past dependent via Bayesian methodology. There are many factors that influence the prepayment behavior and {{for many of them}} there is no available (or impossible to gather) information. We implement this issue by creating a Bayesian mixture model and construct a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the parameters. We assess the model on a data set from the Bloomberg Database. Our results show that the <b>burnout</b> <b>effect</b> is a significant variable for explaining normal prepayment activities. This result does not hold when prepayment is triggered by non-pool dependent events. We show how to use the new model to compute prices for Mortgage Backed Securities. Monte Carlo simulation is the traditional method for obtaining such prices and the proposed model can be easily incorporated within simulation pricing framework.

This paper discusses the development of prepayment models for pools of fixed-rate mortgages. The models are complete: calibrated functional forms are given {{for all of the}} factors that determine prepayment rates. Hence, the models can be used as benchmarks against the simple models of the Public Securities Association, the Federal Housing Administration experience, or the variety of projected prepayment rates generated by proprietary industry models. The key factors that determine prepayment rates are: (1) refinancing incentive, (2) seasonal variations, (3) seasoning of the mortgage pool, and (4) <b>burnout</b> <b>effect.</b> Each factor is modeled separately and is calibrated using historical data. A multiplicative relationship determines the prepayment rate of the mortgage pool.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 98 - 102). Teaching {{is one of}} {{the most}} challenging professions due to different stressors teachers are exposed to sometimes leading to teachers’ burnout: a syndrome of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment. <b>Burnout</b> <b>effects</b> range from psychological, physical, and behavioral symptoms to increased turnover. Teachers are not the only victims of burnout; students and the educational system as a whole are also affected by the syndrome. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the levels of burnout and the factors that may cause Lebanese teachers’ burnout by eliciting teachers’ perspectives about them. Multiple-case studies design is used in order to understand the causes of burnout from different perspectives. An interview, a questionnaire including an adapted version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory- Educators Survey (MBI-ES), and a researcher’s reflective journal are used as instruments. Nine teachers who left the profession at least once during the first five years of experience were interviewed and ninety-two teachers who were still teaching during 2013 - 2014 responded to the questionnaire. Descriptive statistics are used to analyze the questionnaire data; qualitative analysis is used for the interviews and the researcher’s reflective journal. Qualitative analysis for each case is performed followed by a cross case synthesis. The latter is conducted to compare the data between cases in order to discover whether similarities can be found between different teachers. Triangulation of the findings is performed through comparing the findings from each instrument and identifying common categories that are used to address the research questions. Findings show that workload, school environment, coordination/mentoring, classroom environment, and emotional factors are major causes of burnout. Findings in this study were found to be parallel to the findings of several researchers; however, different causes of burnout were also found in terms of school and personal background, school and classroom environment, support, workload, and emotional factors. This study provided insight on how to identify causes and symptoms of teacher burnout in order to help prevent the occurrence of the syndrome. 1 hard copy: xii, 144 leaves; col. ill., facsims.; 31 cm. available at RNL...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the direct and indirect – mediated by job <b>burnout</b> – <b>effects</b> of job demands on mental and physical health problems. The Job Demands–Resources model was the theoretical framework of the study. Three job demands were taken into account – interpersonal conflicts at work, organizational constraints and workload. Indicators of mental and physical health problems included depression and physical symptoms, respectively. Material and Methods: Three hundred and sixteen Polish teachers from 8 schools participated in the study. The hypotheses were tested with the use of tools measuring job demands (Interpersonal Conflicts at Work, Organizational Constraints, Quantitative Workload), job burnout (the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory), depression (the Beck Hopelessness Scale), and physical symptoms (the Physical Symptoms Inventory). The regression analysis with bootstrapping, using the PROCESS macros of Hayes was applied. Results: The results support the hypotheses partially. The indirect effect and to some extent the direct effect of job demands turned out to be statistically important. The negative impact of 3 job demands on mental (hypothesis 1 – H 1) and physical (hypothesis 2 – H 2) health were mediated by the increasing job burnout. Only organizational constraints were directly associated with mental (and not physical) health. Conclusions: The results partially support the notion of the Job Demands-Resources model and provide further insight into processes leading to the low well-being of teachers in the workplace...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} waste {{gasification}} as a technology allowing co-firing of {{large quantities of}} biodegradable wastes in power boiler. In contrast to common landfilling and direct co-firing, gasification of wastes presents a number of advantages. Problematic species included in original feedstocks can be partly safely incinerated in the furnace and partly retain in the gasification residues. The choice of gasification technology determines whether these residues could be further used {{in the construction industry}} or should nevertheless be landfilled but benefiting from significantly reduced volume with respect to original waste. Similarly, the choice of gasification technology determines the quality of product gas in terms of its composition and yield. On one hand, the higher the calorific value of product gas, less modification of an existing boiler is needed but the investment costs for gasifier are high. On the other hand large furnaces of coal boilers allow integration of relatively simple gasifiers generating low quality product gas which still will undergo complete <b>burnout.</b> Little <b>effect</b> on boiler operation in terms of long term phenomena like fouling or corrosion is expected to be associated with co-firing of low calorific gas in standard coal power boilers.

Typical microstructure of the ceramic sintered at 1500 °C consisted of large nearly spherical pores (created by starch) uniformly distributed in a dense ZrO 2 matrix. As the content of starch in the dried product (expressed as volume fraction) Xst is increased from 0. 23 to 0. 65, porosity of the ceramic sintered at 1500 °C increased from 38 to 52 vol.

In this case, the pore structure contained pores having sizes above 50 μm and resulted completely interconnected while for those prepared using corn starch the pore interconnection occurred for...|$|R
40|$|Personal {{resources}} are commonly examined {{as part of}} the job demands–resources (JD-R) model, but unlike work resources, personal {{resources are}} rarely found to moderate the impact of demands on well-being. The present study conceptualizes proactive coping (efforts directed toward the management of future stressors) as a personal resource within an expanded version of the JD-R model that differentiates demands into 2 stressor categories: challenges and hindrances. We investigated the role of proactive coping as a moderator of the effects of these 2 forms of work demand on burnout and engagement. A measure of proactive coping was developed from existing scales of proactive work behavior. Results of a cross-sectional survey of 147 Australian employees showed that proactive coping moderated relations between challenge stressors and engagement, as well as relations between challenge stressors and <b>burnout.</b> No moderation <b>effects</b> were observed for hindrance stressors. The study highlights the value of the expanded JD-R model, the merits of proactive coping, and some of the potential benefits of developing employee proactivity. 24 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Prior {{research}} has underlined the key role that specific personal {{resources such as}} generalized self-efficacy and Big-Five traits play {{in the process of}} burnout. However, no studies have examined the predictive and incremental role of emotional intelligence over and above the domains and facets of these classic constructs of burnout. Objectives: The authors investigated in a sample of Spanish secondary teachers, whether emotional intelligence scores would account for variance in burnout dimensions (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment) beyond the level attributable to generalized self-efficacy and big-five personality traits. Method: A sample of teachers completed the general self-efficacy scale, the Big-Five questionnaire, the emotional intelligence Scale, and the burnout inventory. Results: Stepwise multiple regression analysis confirmed these findings and indicated that emotional intelligence abilities accounted for further variance in three burnout subscales not accounted for by generalized self-efficacy and personality traits. Conclusion: These findings extend previous studies and provide additional support for the incremental validity of the emotional intelligence suggesting that emotional intelligence abilities {{have a role to play}} in <b>burnout,</b> often with <b>effects</b> that are incremental over the basic dimensions of generalized self-efficacy and personality traits.
