40|$|Abstract: Attraction of {{sturgeons}} to fishway entrances {{is poorly}} studied but observations on adult Shortnose Sturgeon, Acipenser brevirostrum, entering {{one of two}} fish lifts at Holyoke Dam, Connecticut River, MA, USA, indicate the benthic sturgeons need a <b>bottom</b> <b>entrance</b> with a submerged orifice if the water is deep. Sturgeons can pass upstream in nature-like or ramp fishways, or in technical fishways, like fish lifts, but not so good in traditional fish ladders. Keys to passing sturgeons in fish lifts is 1) attracting fish to the entrance by induced currents, 2) operating the lift during the seasonal (and daily diel period) of migration, 3) cycling the crowder trap within the time period fish will remain at the barrier without departing, and 4) designing the appropriate lift hopper. Adults have a moderate swimming ability and can ascend fish ladders, but they ascend best when the fish ladder design enables them to continuously swim upstream. Unfortunately, most fish ladders (e. g., pool 2 ̆ 6 weir, vertical slot) have cross walls that prevent sturgeons from continuously swimming upstream: {{an important aspect of}} their swimming style. Also, observations in an artificial ladder showed a series of ascents and descents before fish {{reached the top of the}} ladder. This suggests that any ladder for sturgeons should allow fish to descend without injury and loss of upstream ascent drive. Experiments with several species of sturgeons in a prototype sidebaffle ladder allowed fish to swim continuously during ascent and did not harm them during descent. Fish moved freely upand downstream like they might use a seminatural channel. Plans are to install the prototype at a dam in 2015 or 2016 to field test the design...|$|E

40|$|A set of twenty-four {{colonies of}} honeybees {{was divided into}} three groups, two of which {{received}} different intensities of artificial heat, applied by means of specially designed heating frames placed {{in the middle of}} the brood chambers, from 2 Jan. to 16 Mar. 1942. Heating the colonies reduced the area of brood present at the beginning of May without noticeably affecting the consumption of carbohydrate stores and thus had an adverse effect on the colonies. This conclusion is in agreement with that reached as a result of earlier work (Butler & Cockbill, 1942.) Colonies in hives fitted with top entrances were no stronger in the spring than colonies in hives with bottom entrances, nor did they show any significant difference in store consumption. No significant brood chamber temperature differences were found in hives fitted with top entrances as compared with control hives which had normal bottom entrances. During the period when heat was applied to the colonies by means of the heating frames the minimum brood chamber temperature was significantly higher in the heated hives than in the control, unheated, hives, this being especially marked in the case of the hives fitted with 6 W. heaters. Throughout the experiment the minimum brood chamber temperature of all the hives showed a close dependence on screen temperature. During the preliminary period before the heat was turned on a change of 1 d̀ C. screen temperature was associated with change of 0. 92 d̀ C. in the minimum brood chamber temperature in hives with top entrances, and a change of 0. 86 d̀ C. in hives with bottom entrances.

40|$|Abstract: Traditional {{downstream}} {{guidance and}} bypass facilities for anadromous fishes (surface bypasses, surface guidance structures, and behavioral barriers) have typically been ineffective for anguillid eels. Because eels typically spend {{the majority of}} their time near the bottom in forebay environments, deep bypass <b>entrance</b> structures with <b>bottom</b> <b>entrances</b> hold some promise for increased effectiveness as protection measures for this species. A new design of deep-entrance bypass system that uses airlift technology (the Conte Airlift Bypass) to induce flow in a bypass pipe was hydraulically and biologically tested in a simulated forebay environment under controlled laboratory conditions. Water velocities of 0. 9 to 1. 5 m/sec could be generated at the bypass entrance (opening with 0. 073 m 2 area), with corresponding flows of 0. 07 to 0. 11 m 3 /sec. Gas saturation and hydrostatic pressure within the bypass pipe did not vary appreciably from a control (no air) condition under tested airflows. Migratory silver-phase American eels (Anguilla rostrata) tested at night under dark conditions readily located, entered, and passed the bypass; initial avoidance rates (fish avoiding entrainment into the entrance) were lower at higher entrance velocities. Fish that entered the bypass pipe tended to enter headfirst, but those fish that then exited the pipe upstream (rejected the bypass) did so more frequently at lower entrance velocities. Eels appeared to swim against the flow while being transported downstream through the pipe; median transit times for each test velocity ranged from 5. 8 to 13. 7 sec, with transit time decreasing with increasing entrance velocity. There was no strong avoidance of the vertical section of the pipe which contained injected air. No mortality or injury of bypassed eels was observed, and individual eels repeatedly passed through the bypass at rates of up to 30 passes per hour, suggesting that individuals do not avoid repeated entrainment through the bypass...|$|R

40|$|We {{report an}} {{experimental}} study of the intermittent dynamics of a gas flowing through a column of a non-Newtonian fluid. In a given range of the imposed constant flow rate, the system spontaneously alternates between two regimes: bubbles emitted at the bottom either rise independently {{one from the other}} or merge to create a winding flue which then connects the <b>bottom</b> air <b>entrance</b> to the free surface. The observations are reminiscent of the spontaneous changes in the degassing regime observed on volcanoes and suggest that, in the nature, such a phenomenon is likely to be governed by the non-Newtonian properties of the magma. We focus on the statistical distribution of the lifespans of the bubbling and flue regimes in the intermittent steady state. The bubbling regime exhibits a characteristic time whereas, interestingly, the flue lifespan displays a decaying power-law distribution. The associated exponent, which is significantly smaller than the value 1. 5 often reported experimentally and predicted in some standard intermittency scenarios, depends on the fluid properties and can be interpreted as the ratio of two characteristic times of the system.

The flood dominant form of the surface elevation in the channel (unlike the ebb dominant tide in the fjord) is formed over a horizontal distance of 50 m over a shallow <b>bottom</b> at the <b>entrance</b> to the channel. The tide in shallow places becomes asymmetric due to nonlinear effects caused by the influence of the bottom and especially by choking of the tidal flow over a sill that is located between the fjord and channel.

40|$|Susu Dam is an RCC Dam under {{construction}} in Peninsula Malaysia. The dam design {{has been carried out}} by SMEC International in its offices in Kuala Lumpur. The dam is some 90 m tall. The overfall stepped spillway provides for discharges to enter a hydraulic jump stilling basin for energy dissipation, prior to passing through a culvert under a roadway. The spillway was subject to hydraulic model testing at the Utah Water Research Laboratory of Utah State University (USA), at a length scale of 1 : 30. The hydraulic performance of the spillway design was evaluated up to the 4, 700 m 3 /s Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) discharge (almost 1, 000 L/s model scale). The spillway was tested through a number of configurations, prior {{to the development of the}} final arrangement. The purpose of the paper is to describe the modelling detail, and then focus on the flow behaviour at the stair-stepped spillway chute with 2. 4 m high steps, in particular the piezometric pressures and transient pressures on the tread and riser of the steps. The spillway chute converged from ~ 100 m at the crest to 78 m at the <b>bottom</b> at <b>entrance</b> to the stilling basin; the unit discharge entering the stilling basin was ~ 60 m 2 /s for the PMF. Of particular interest was the occurrence of negative pressures on the steps, and the paper will describe the transients for several discharges from the AEP 1 in 1, 000 up to the PMF; the results indicating very low pressures into a cavitation region. The design provides for an aerator across the spillway in order to counter the effects of possible cavitation. Results will be presented with and without the aerator operating.

The graph camera image is rendered at 40 fps. In interactive 3 -D graphics applications the user typically explores the scene by positioning and orienting a virtual camera. When the experience of actual locomotion in the virtual space is unnecessary, such sequential exploration is undesirable since it is inefficient-the user has to cover large distances in the scene, and ineffective-the user can only see {{a small fraction of}} the scene at any given time, which is particularly inadequate for dynamic scenes. The conventional solution is to employ several stationary cameras that render the scene in parallel. However, a large number of cameras is required for adequate scene coverage and there is no continuity between individual images, which requires the user to adapt to a multitude of contexts, one at the time. We introduce the graph camera, a non-pinhole camera with rays that circumvent occluders to sample most or all of a 3 -D scene. The graph camera image has a single layer, it is mostly continuous and non-redundant, yet it shows simultaneously all regions of interest in a complex 3 -D scene. The graph camera is constructed from a planar pinhole camera through a series of view frustum bending, splitting, and merging operations. The graph camera has tens or even hundreds of frusta, yet rendering is efficient due to a fast projection operation that allows rendering in a single pass and allows resolving visibility automatically...|$|R
