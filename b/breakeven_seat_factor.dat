40|$|Judgements {{of overall}} seating comfort in dynamic {{conditions}} sometimes correlate {{better with the}} static characteristics of a seat than with measures of the dynamic environment. This study developed qualitative models of overall seat discomfort to include both static and dynamic seat characteristics. A dynamic factor that reflected how vibration discomfort increased as vibration magnitude increased was combined with a static <b>seat</b> <b>factor</b> which reflected <b>seating</b> comfort without vibration. The ability of the model to predict the relative and overall importance of dynamic and static seat characteristics on comfort was tested in two experiments. A paired comparison experiment, using four polyurethane foam cushions (50, 70, 100, 120 mm thick), provided different static and dynamic comfort when 12 subjects were exposed to one-third octave band random vertical vibration with centre frequencies of 2. 5 and 5. 5 Hz, at magnitudes of 0. 00, 0. 25 and 0. 50 m. s- 2 rms measured beneath the foam samples. Subject judgements of the relative discomfort of the different conditions depended on both static and dynamic characteristics {{in a manner consistent}} with the model. The effect of static and dynamic <b>seat</b> <b>factors</b> on overall <b>seat</b> discomfort was investigated by magnitude estimation using three foam cushions (of different hardness) and a rigid wooden seat at six vibration magnitudes with 20 subjects. Static <b>seat</b> <b>factors</b> (i. e. cushion stiffness) affected the manner in which vibration influenced the overall discomfort: cushions with lower stiffness were more comfortable and more sensitive to changes in vibration magnitude than those with higher stiffness. The experiments confirm that judgements of overall seat discomfort can be affected by both the static and dynamic characteristics of a seat, with the effect depending on vibration magnitude: when vibration magnitude was low, discomfort was dominated by static seat factors; as the vibration magnitude increased, discomfort became dominated by dynamic factors...|$|R

Moreover, Laker Airways had figured that the aircraft's low break-even <b>seat</b> <b>factor</b> would enable it to operate its proposed London - New York Skytrain with a lower break-even factor compared to the 707, an ageing narrowbodied aircraft whose costs were higher per passenger. The DC-10s also had huge potential to boost the projected profitability of Skytrain. Revised estimates anticipated an average load factor of 70-75% and raised the traffic forecast for the first year of operation to 250,000 passengers each way.

30|$|There are {{at least}} six load factors drivers in the airline industry. The first driver is the industry’s output {{decisions}} relative to demand growth. The output growth must be brought into alignment with demand growth. The second driver is pricing. Fare reductions generally stimulate demand. Load factors are affected depending upon capacity decisions. The third driver is the traffic mix. Historically, the higher the proportion of business travellers carried by an airline, the lower the average <b>seat</b> <b>factor.</b> That is, the random element in demand for business travels (highly volatile demand) suggests a lower average load factor in business and first class cabins [31]. The fourth driver is refund policies. A carrier taking non-refundable payment {{at the time of}} reservation is likely to have relatively few no-shows and a relatively higher <b>seat</b> <b>factor</b> than carriers selling a high portion of fully flexible tickets. The fifth driver is commercial success. A success of product design, promotions, marketing communications, distributions, and service delivery will influence load factors. The sixth driver is revenue management. The effectiveness of revenue management systems (RMS) will influence load factors. The RMS capabilities, specifically the refinement of demand forecasting tools, will contribute significantly [30]. Depending on market conditions in the airline industry, there exist a trade-off between load and yield. Unless demand is particularly strong and output growth is under firm control, it is likely that rising yields will be associated with downward pressure on load factors. In contrast, a falling yield tends to be associated with higher load factors. The trade-off suggests that airline carriers will generally want to arrive at a capacity, which targets a load factor balances between the costs of turning passengers away and the costs of meeting all peak demand and oversupplying the market (“double-edged sword”). In general, therefore, from an operational perspective it is easier to manage an airline when load factors are at 64  % than when they are at 84  % [9]. The size of the load factor is therefore a measure of success in the airline industry. However, the success factor is challenged by the fact that demand is volatile and fluctuates in units of single seat-departures in different origin and destination markets. In contrast, the capacity can only be delivered in units of available aircrafts for the particular flight-leg. That is, routes designed to serve the origin and destination markets are broadly fixed in the short run. Furthermore, the necessity to maintain both high flight completion rates, the integrity of network connections, and aircraft/crew assignments, may make it almost impossible for a scheduled passenger carrier to cancel a significant number of its lightly loaded flights [4].|$|R

40|$|Whole-body {{vibration}} exposure of locomotive engineers and the vibration attenuation {{of seats in}} 22 U. S. locomotives (built between 1959 and 2000) was studied during normal revenue service and following international measurement guidelines. Triaxial vibration measurements (duration mean 155 min, range 84 - 383 min) on the seat and on the floor were compared. In addition to the basic vibration evaluation (aw rms), the vector sum (av), the maximum transient vibration value (MTVV/aw), the vibration dose value (VDV/(aw T 1 / 4)), and the vibration <b>seat</b> effective transmissibility <b>factor</b> (<b>SEAT)</b> were calculated. The power spectral densities are also reported. The mean basic vibration level (aw rms) was for the fore-aft axis x = 0. 18 m/sec 2, the lateral axis y = 0. 28 m/sec 2, and the vertical axis z = 0. 32 m/sec 2. The mean vector sum was 0. 59 m/sec 2 (range 0. 27 to 1. 44). The crest factors were generally at or above 9 in the horizontal and vertical axis. The mean MTVV/aw was 5. 3 (x), 5. 1 (y), and 4. 8 (z), and the VDV/(aw T 1 / 4) values ranged from 1. 32 to 2. 3 (x-axis), 1. 33 to 1. 7 (y-axis), and 1. 38 to 1. 86 (z-axis), generally indicating high levels of shocks. The mean <b>seat</b> transmissibility <b>factor</b> (<b>SEAT)</b> was 1. 4 (x) and 1. 2 (y) and 1 (z), demonstrating a general ineffectiveness {{of any of the}} seat suspension systems. In conclusion, these data indicate that locomotive rides are characterized by relatively high shock content (acceleration peaks) of the vibration signal in all directions. Locomotive vertical and lateral vibrations are similar, which appears to be characteristic for rail vehicles compared with many road/off-road vehicles. Tested locomotive cab seats currently in use (new or old) appear inadequate to reduce potentially harmful vibration and shocks transmitted to the seated operator, and older seats particularly lack basic ergonomic features regarding adjustability and postural support...|$|R

Interestingly, it was revealed that quality was categorized into four sub-dimensions: attractive quality, uni-dimensional quality, must-be quality, and indifferent quality. Data analysis results provided key implications. First, according to Kano analysis, attractive quality is composed of interior illumination and activity. Uni-dimensional quality is composed of temperature, indoor air, cleanliness, and spatial density factors(inconvenient, narrow, complex). Indifferent quality is composed of convenience and social density factors(busy, crowded, disorder). Second, activity of waiting <b>seating</b> condition <b>factor</b> has the highest Timko’s customer satisfaction coefficient(. 58), but temperature of ambient condition factor and cleanliness of waiting <b>seating</b> condition <b>factor</b> have the lowest coefficient(-. 51).

For example, for the HS trains, each with the seat capacity of s =  485 seats and the average load factor ρ =  0.80, operating on the line of length of d =  500  km at the operating speed of V =  300  km/h and the service frequency in the single direction of f(T) =  15 trains/h, {{the transport}} work on the line’s demand and supply sides during the period of 1  h will be TWS =  15  ×  500  ×  485  =  3, 637, 500 (seat-km) and TWD =  15  ×  500  ×  485  ×  0.80  =  2, 910, 000 (pax-km), respectively. The corresponding productivity under the same conditions will be TPS =  15  ×  485  ×  300  =  2, 182, 500 (seat-km/h) and TPS =  15  ×  485  ×  0.80  ×  300  =  1, 746, 000, respectively (pax-km/h).|$|R
