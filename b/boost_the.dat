5|$|Brusilov's {{offensive}} {{was stopped}} only in August 1916, with reinforcements from the Western Front. Despite {{being forced to}} retreat, {{the performance of the}} Polish forces impressed Austro-Hungarian and German commanders, and contributed to their decision to recreate some form of Polish statehood in order to <b>boost</b> <b>the</b> recruitment of Polish troops. Their limited concessions, however, did not satisfy Piłsudski; {{in the aftermath of the}} Oath Crisis he was arrested and the Legions disbanded.|$|E

5|$|Most of the population, {{urban and}} rural, took out their anger and frustrations on the nation's Vietnamese population. Lon Nol's call for 10,000 volunteers to <b>boost</b> <b>the</b> {{manpower}} of Cambodia's poorly equipped, 30,000-man army, managed to swamp the military with over 70,000 recruits. Rumours abounded concerning a possible PAVN offensive aimed at Phnom Penh itself. Paranoia flourished and this {{set off a}} violent reaction against the nation's 400,000 ethnic Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|On 29 November 2011, {{the member}} state finance ministers agreed {{to expand the}} EFSF by {{creating}} certificates that could guarantee up to 30% of new issues from troubled euro-area governments, and to create investment vehicles that would <b>boost</b> <b>the</b> EFSF's firepower to intervene in primary and secondary bond markets.|$|E

Progress M1-2 docked with Mir on April 27. On April 26, the Progress M1-1 spacecraft, which had been docked since February and {{was used by the}} Russian Federal Space Agency to <b>boost</b> <b>the</b> station to a higher orbit, undocked and de-orbited over the Pacific Ocean east of New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|Salyut 6's {{propulsion}} system experienced a serious malfunction {{during the second}} crew residency in 1978 and was not usable again {{for the remainder of}} the station's lifespan. As a consequence, it was limited to firing its attitude control thrusters and visiting spacecraft had to perform orbital adjustments. After each crew residency ended, it was necessary for Progress and TKS spacecraft to <b>boost</b> <b>the</b> station into a high orbit so it wouldn't decay until the next residency began.|$|E

5|$|Agoncillo and {{her daughters}} stayed in Hong Kong from 1895 to 1906. She took care of their house, which became an asylum. Their funds had run out because of the heavy {{expenses}} incurred by Don Felipe for his diplomatic activities in France and in the United States. She once had to sell the children's pinafores and their jewels to support her family and {{to pay for their}} voyage back to Manila. The other money was also used to help <b>boost</b> <b>the</b> revolutionary funds. Their support for the revolution made them an impoverished family; however, they gained it back when Don Felipe returned to his profession.|$|E

5|$|Another {{factor that}} helped Tchaikovsky's music become popular was {{a shift in}} {{attitude}} among Russian audiences. Whereas they had previously been satisfied with flashy virtuoso performances of technically demanding but musically lightweight compositions, they gradually began listening with increasing appreciation of the music itself. Tchaikovsky's works were performed frequently, with few delays between their composition and first performances; the publication from 1867 onward of his songs and great piano music for the home market also helped <b>boost</b> <b>the</b> composer's popularity.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1930s, the state of California had floated the idea of {{diverting}} water from the rainy north to support irrigation in the fertile, but dry San Joaquin Valley. A diversion of the Trinity River was contemplated in order to <b>boost</b> <b>the</b> available water supply for the Central Valley watershed, but planners eventually determined that the extra water was not yet needed. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation took over the Central Valley Project from the bankrupt state of California during the Great Depression in 1933 as a federal public works project, and in 1942 it began investigations to dam the Trinity River. However, the Trinity River plan was dropped in 1945, {{after the completion of}} nearby Shasta Dam.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{tried to}} promote the {{diversification}} of agriculture via the production of linen and hemp, following experiences with his friend Martín de Altolaguirre. He proposed to keep reserves of wheat to help have control over its price. He also tried to make leather recognised {{as a product of}} the country, in order to promote its commercial potential. None of these proposals were accepted. He designed a system to give prizes to achievements that would <b>boost</b> <b>the</b> local economy, diversify the agriculture, or deforest the pampas. The system did not work as expected, and as nobody met the requirements no such prize was ever given.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, the Armour Research Foundation (ARF), {{based at}} the Illinois Institute of Technology, began {{studying}} the effects of nuclear explosions on the environment. These studies continued until 1962. In May 1958, ARF began covertly researching the potential consequences of an atomic explosion on the Moon. The main objective of the program, which ran {{under the auspices of}} the United States Air Force, which had initially proposed it, was to cause a nuclear explosion that would be visible from Earth. It was hoped that such a display would <b>boost</b> <b>the</b> morale of the American people.|$|E

The national team joined the tournaments such as the Pestabola Merdeka, Pesta Sukan, Jakarta Anniversary Tournamentp and the President Park Tournament. The Philippines managed to cause upsets results against Thailand, Singapore and South Korea. When the Spanish players, Tomas Lozano, Mannuel Cuenca, Juan Guitierrez and Julio Roxas left the football team due to financial reasons, football in the country saw another decline and basketball gained foothold in the country.|$|E

Writers created and introduced a new family, the Parkers, who already had a link to Ramsay Street {{in the form of}} Ned Parker (Daniel O'Connor). The family made their first on-screen appearance in July 2007, marking the start of the show's renovation.|$|E

While there, she also met children with disabilities at a special school maintained by the army. In August, along with Mumbai-based artist Gurcharan Singh, Zinta painted for the cause of street children for the non-governmental organisation Khushi. In December, she joined the efforts of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to curb human trafficking in India. She spoke on behalf of awareness against the practice, the need for protection and rehabilitation for those rescued from it, and punishment for perpetrators.|$|E
5|$|Kansas' {{victory over}} Virginia Tech was the Jayhawks' fifth bowl victory {{and was the}} 11thbowl game {{in the history of}} the Kansas Jayhawks {{football}} team. Because of the unexpected nature of the Jayhawks' success, some pundits proclaimed the 2008 Orange Bowl as ranking among the greatest Kansas sports victories of all time. The game paid $17million to Kansas and the Big 12 Conference and helped to <b>boost</b> <b>the</b> Kansas football team's national profile among potential recruits. In addition, the bowl appearance assisted the Kansas Athletic Department's fundraising efforts.|$|E
5|$|Orange Bowl {{organizers}} {{predicted that}} Virginia Tech fans, who were located {{closer to the}} site of the game, would be attracted by its proximity and the warm weather offered by southern Florida. Delta Air Lines added more flights from Virginia to Florida in anticipation. To entice more fans to attend, tourism officials planned to step up their advertising in order to <b>boost</b> <b>the</b> economic impact of the event, estimated in 2009 at $200million. The advertising campaign was a difficult sell because the game was scheduled for the first Monday after New Year's Day, the date when most American workers return to their jobs after the New Year.|$|E
