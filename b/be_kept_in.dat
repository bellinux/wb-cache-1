5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, {{in the more}} {{developed}} parts of the world, animals are often intensively managed; dairy cows may <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> zero-grazing conditions with all their forage brought to them; beef cattle may <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> high density feedlots; pigs may be housed in climate-controlled buildings and never go outdoors; poultry may be reared in barns and kept in cages as laying birds under lighting-controlled conditions. In between these two extremes are semi-intensive, often family run farms where livestock graze outside {{for much of the}} year, silage or hay is made to cover the times of year when the grass stops growing, and fertiliser, feed and other inputs are bought onto the farm from outside.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched Aylesbury ducklings are timid {{and thrive}} best in small groups, so the duckers would divide them into {{groups of three}} or four ducklings, each {{accompanied}} by a hen. As the ducklings grew older and gained confidence, they would <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> groups of around 30. Originally the ducks would <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> every room in the ducker's cottage, but {{towards the end of the}} 19thcentury they were kept in outdoor pens and sheds with suitable protection against cold weather.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} beetle are kept as pets, for example diving beetles (Dytiscidae) may <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a {{domestic}} fresh water tank.|$|E

5|$|The museum {{stresses}} that the paintings <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> good condition by whoever has them. Museum director, Anne Hawley {{has stated that}} the works should <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a stable environment of 50% humidity and 70°F. Additionally, they should be kept away from light and stored in acid-free paper. Hawley also noted to avoid rolling the paintings, which will crack the paint. If these guidelines are not followed, the paintings could be damaged and drop in value. More repainting {{would need to be}} done too, which hurts the paintings' integrity.|$|E
5|$|A dolphinarium is an {{aquarium}} for dolphins. The dolphins are usually {{kept in a}} large pool, though occasionally they may <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> pens in the open sea, either for research or for public performances. Some dolphinariums consist of one pool where dolphins perform for the public, others are part of larger parks, such as marine mammal parks, zoos or theme parks, with other animals and attractions as well.|$|E
5|$|Life Is Strange is {{a graphic}} {{adventure}} played from a third-person view. The mechanic of rewinding time allows the player to redo any action {{that has been}} taken. The player can examine and interact with objects, which enables puzzle solving {{in the form of}} fetch quests and making changes to the environment. Items that are collected before time travelling will <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the inventory after the fact.|$|E

50|$|Some {{portraits of}} John of Egmont <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam and the Centraal Museum of Utrecht. A diptych, painted by the Master of Alkmaar, <b>is</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York.|$|R
5|$|Metallic {{plutonium}} {{is produced}} by reacting plutonium tetrafluoride with barium, calcium or lithium at 1200°C. It is attacked by acids, oxygen, and steam but not by alkalis and dissolves easily in concentrated hydrochloric, hydroiodic and perchloric acids. Molten metal must <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a vacuum or an inert atmosphere to avoid reaction with air. At 135°C the metal will ignite in air and will explode if placed in carbon tetrachloride.|$|E
5|$|NuScale's design {{does not}} rely on powered water pumps or circulatory equipment. The company claims it can shut down and {{continue}} cooling itself indefinitely {{in the event of}} a catastrophe. The devices are intended to <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a below-ground pool, to absorb the shock of earthquakes, with a concrete lid over the pool. In the event that AC power is lost for normal cooling systems, the pool water begins to absorb heat and boil.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, some Roman writers, {{particularly}} Republican figures, used Alexander as {{a cautionary tale}} of how autocratic tendencies can <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> check by republican values. Alexander was used by these writers {{as an example of}} ruler values such as amicita (friendship) and clementia (clemency), but also iracundia (anger) and cupiditas gloriae (over-desire for glory).|$|E

50|$|One, Michael Metrinko, <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> solitary {{confinement}} for months. On two occasions, when he expressed {{his opinion of}} Ayatollah Khomeini, he was punished severely. The first time, he <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> handcuffs for two weeks, and the second time, he <b>was</b> beaten and <b>kept</b> alone <b>in</b> a freezing cell for two weeks.|$|R
5|$|The Tour organisers did {{not make}} many changes the rules or route for the next race, because they {{had worked in the}} 1906 Tour de France. The revised points system would <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> this form until 1911, only to be changed a little bit in 1912 before being {{replaced}} by the time system in 1913. The flamme rouge that was introduced in 1906 to indicate the final kilometre of a stage was kept and is still in use.|$|E
5|$|There were 43reported injuries; {{two people}} were deemed to be seriously injured enough to <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> hospital, one in Watford General Hospital, with {{breathing}} difficulties, and another in Hemel Hempstead Hospital, although they were not in a life-threatening condition. Some early media reports spoke of eight fatalities, but these may have been persons missing. All members of staff from the terminal were accounted for.|$|E
5|$|All IQ {{tests show}} {{variation}} in scores {{even when the}} same person takes the same test over and over again. IQ scores also differ for a test-taker taking tests {{from more than one}} publisher at the same age. The various test publishers do not use uniform names or definitions for IQ score classifications. All these issues must <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> mind when interpreting an individual's IQ scores, because they all can result in different IQ classifications for the same person at different times.|$|E

5|$|Bred {{primarily}} as hunting dogs, {{their goal is}} to find the bird, send it into the air and then to retrieve it on command after the hunter has shot the quarry. The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in marshland, fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular in their native Russia as their small size makes them suitable to <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> busy cities, and easily transported to hunting sites.|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{are often}} grown in greenhouses, {{particularly}} in regions unsuited to {{the cultivation of}} cacti outdoors, such the northern parts of Europe and North America. Here, they may <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> pots or grown in the ground. Cacti are also grown as houseplants, many being tolerant of the often dry atmosphere. Cacti in pots may be placed outside in the summer to ornament gardens or patios, and then kept under cover during the winter. Less drought-resistant epiphytes, such as epiphyllum hybrids, Schlumbergera (the Thanksgiving or Christmas cactus) and Hatiora (the Easter cactus), are widely cultivated as houseplants.|$|E
5|$|Cagebirds such as canaries, budgerigars, cockatoos, lovebirds, quails, finches, and parrots {{are popular}} pets, whether for their song, their behaviour, their {{colourful}} plumage, or {{their ability to}} mimic speech. Among reasons for their popularity {{is that they can}} <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> homes too small or otherwise unsuitable for dogs or cats. The cagebird trade {{in some parts of the}} world threatens certain species with extinction, when birds are illegally captured in the wild. For example, in Indonesia, at least 13 species are close to extinction including the Indonesian national bird, the Javan hawk-eagle, while five subspecies including the scarlet-breasted lorikeet may have become extinct in the wild.|$|E

5|$|During {{assembly}} of Collins bow section in Sweden, multiple defects in the hull welding were discovered. Different reasons were given by different parties for the problems: the steel alloy {{used for the}} hull required different welding techniques to those normally used by Kockums; the Swedish navy always requested partial penetration welds for their submarines, while the RAN wanted full penetration welding, but had not made this clear; delays in delivering the steel plates to Kockums resulted in rushed work and a resulting drop in quality. Kockums engineers proposed that the section <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> Sweden for repairs, but to minimise delays it was accepted as-is, with repairs attempted at ASC during full {{assembly of}} the first boat.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{only means}} of {{communication}} is a walkie-talkie connecting him to his supervisor, Delilah. Players may choose {{from a number of}} dialog options to speak with her upon the discovery of new interactive objects or environments, or can refrain from communicating. The player's choices will influence the tone of Henry's relationship with Delilah. As the story progresses, new areas will be opened up for players. The game also features a day-night cycle. Objects found in the wilderness can <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the inventory for later use.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} speed the {{dismantling}} of the third-class forts, the 22nd Army Corps issued General Order 89, which stated (in part) that the guns and ammunition removed from the dismantled forts should <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> storage. Fort Corcoran was chosen as one of the storage locations and thus avoided the immediate demise of the other third-class fortifications. By the end of August 1865, however, with funds running low, and no further appropriations likely, more and more forts were designated as second- or third-class locations, and were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners. Fort Corcoran stored the cannon of the dismantled forts located south of the Potomac River.|$|E
