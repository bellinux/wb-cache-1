Scout's impulsive inclination to fight students who insult Atticus reflects her attempt {{to stand up for}} him and defend him. [...] Atticus is the moral center of the novel, however, and he teaches Jem {{one of the most significant}} lessons of courage. [...] In a statement that both foreshadows Atticus' motivation for defending Tom Robinson and describes Mrs. Dubose, who is determined to break herself of a morphine addiction, Atticus tells Jem that courage is [...] "when you're licked <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what".|$|E

I was the first girl you met, when you arrived in England; and I doubt whether you had seen another, before we came down to stay at Netherly.

60|$|We may, indeed, {{state it}} briefly thus:--Suppose {{you have to}} build a castle, with towers and roofs and buttresses, out of bricks of a given shape, and that these bricks are all lying in a huge heap at the bottom, in utter confusion, upset out of carts at random. You would have to draw a great many plans, and count all your bricks, and be sure you had enough for this and that tower, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>began,</b> and then <b>you</b> would have to lay your foundation, and add layer by layer, in order, slowly.|$|R

"Well, Hallett, {{my advice}} to you in that case is, make love to some young lady, {{directly}} you reach England; and marry her in a month, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> have <b>begun</b> to assume elephantine proportions.

40|$|Building community, that is, {{sustaining}} our {{connections to}} family and our ancestry is often hampered by going to law school. Law schools are highly adept at assimilating you into a profession and a worldview that can {{be at odds with}} who you were and how you saw the world <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>began</b> law school. Unfortunately, in order to fit in, it can seem advantageous to forget tus ralces, your roots. I began by talking about unigndo comunidades as a progressive objective and have been talking about the second part of your conference theme, learning lessons and mobilizing for change, as methods to achieve the objective. I am making a plea that you work more closely with us in LatCrit to create an alliance between progressive law students and law professors that will advance both of our agendas...|$|R

60|$|I'm {{not going}} to compare London, as Englishmen often do, with Paris or Vienna. I won't do two great towns that gross injustice. And, indeed, {{comparison}} here is quite out of the question.
