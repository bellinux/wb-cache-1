40|$|SIM PlanetQuest will {{exploit the}} {{classical}} measuring tool of astrometry (interferometry) with unprecedented precision to make dramatic advances {{in many areas}} of astronomy and astrophysics'(1). In order to obtain interferometric data two large steerable mirrors, or Siderostats, are used to direct starlight into the interferometer. A gimbaled mechanism actuated by linear actuators is chosen to meet the unprecedented pointing and angle tracking requirements of SIM. A group of JPL engineers designed, built, and tested a linear <b>ballscrew</b> <b>actuator</b> capable of performing submicron incremental steps for 10 years of continuous operation. Precise, zero backlash, closed loop pointing control requirements, lead the team to implement a <b>ballscrew</b> <b>actuator</b> with a direct drive DC motor and a precision piezo brake. Motor control commutation using feedback from a precision linear encoder on the ballscrew output produced an unexpected incremental step size of 20 nm over a range of 120 mm, yielding a dynamic range of 6, 000, 000 : 1. The results prove linear nanometer positioning requires no gears, levers, or hydraulic converters. Along the way many lessons have been learned and will subsequently be shared...|$|E
40|$|Future {{aircraft}} architectures will incorporate more energy-efficient electromechanical actuators (EMA) {{for flight}} controls actuation. Development of reliable health monitoring techniques for EMAs promises to maintain or even increase the overall availability {{and safety of}} these new aircraft designs. When it comes to EMAs and similar mechanisms, certain fault types clearly manifest themselves through loss of functionality. Other faults, referred to as latent, do not immediately result in a significantly compromised actuator performance, thus making them challenging to detect. This paper presents a new vibration-based hybrid technique for detecting latent EMA faults without needing an initial stage of fault feature learning. The two faults considered in the study are a high-criticality jam and a low-criticality spall (metal flaking) in the <b>actuator</b> <b>ballscrew</b> mechanism. The <b>actuator</b> position is used to resample variable-speed vibration measurements of a single accelerometer into constant-rate measurements. A set of health characterization signatures is derived theoretically based on the EMA ballscrew kinematics. These theoretical signatures are compared with the signatures extracted from vibration signals measured experimentally on the EMA test articles. The vibration signatures approach is also compared to the diagnostic approach based on EMA motor current measurements. The ability to detect and classify latent faults early as high- or low-critical can improve maintenance planning and increase aircraft dispatch reliability. The technique has been validated on fault-injected data sets collected on the NASA Ames Research Center Flyable Electro-Mechanical Actuator (FLEA) test stand...|$|R
