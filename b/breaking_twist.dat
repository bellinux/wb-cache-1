Fixed-abrasive wire saw, {{with its}} ability to cut hard brittle material, such as silicon ingots, {{crystals}} and quartz, {{has emerged as a}} leading technology for production in semiconductor and photovoltaic industry. There are some defects in conventional fixed-abrasive wire saw such as significant low holding abrasive ability, low machining efficiency, high running costs, etc. A new fixed-abrasive wire, namely brazed diamond wires have been developed to overcome these problems. In this paper, brazed diamond wire were carried out to braze two different size diamond grits onto two different thin steel wires by using a nickel-based powder as brazing alloy. The mechanical properties of brazed diamond wire were evaluated by tensile and <b>breaking</b> <b>twist</b> experiment. The experimental results showed that the heating in the brazing process has litter influence on the wire mechanical properties. The addition of brazed alloy and diamond grits sharply decreased the wire mechanical properties significantly, both in the tensile strength and <b>breaking</b> <b>twist</b> angle. Bigger diamond grit would make the accumulation of brazed alloy which leaded to the deterioration of diameter consistency of wires...|$|E

50|$|Drafting {{is done by}} {{pinching}} off a short section of the rolag, and then pulling back while twist is added to it. The active hand pulls back until the yarn is the desired thickness. The passive hand controls how much twist is allowed in the drafting yarn: too much twist and the yarn won't draft; too little and the yarn will <b>break.</b> <b>Twist</b> concentrates in the thin areas of the yarn, solidifying these. Thus the tension doesn't stretch these parts thinner, but instead drafts the thicker parts until all the yarn is approximately the same thickness. This {{has the effect of}} automatically thinning out the thicker parts, which is what allows this technique to work.|$|R

Schadt built a sample with electrodes and a twisted version of a liquid-crystal material called PEBAB (p-ethoxybenzylidene-p'-aminobenzonitrile), which Helfrich had reported in prior studies at RCA, as part of their guest-host experiments. When voltage is applied, PEBAB aligns itself along the field, <b>breaking</b> the <b>twisting</b> structure and the redirection of the polarization, making the cell turn opaque.|$|R

We utilize a partially quenched construction in which the sea quarks are given by the standard twisted mass lattice action while the valence quarks have an additional strong isospin breaking mass term. This construction allows for a practical use with existing twisted-mass gauge ensembles. Additionally, we construct the relevant partially quenched twisted mass chiral perturbation theory for both mesons and baryons to O(m_q^ 2, m_q a, a^ 2). We provide explicit expressions for the pion, nucleon and delta masses, {{as well as the}} corresponding mass splittings, and discuss the resulting errors from including the strong isospin breaking in the valence sector only. Finally, we demonstrate how the application of this idea can be used, with mild approximations, to determine the values of both the up and down quark masses. Comment: 12 page...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAxonal {{microtubule}} (MT) bundles crosslinked by microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau {{are responsible}} for vital biological functions such as maintaining mechanical integrity {{and shape of the}} axon as well as facilitating axonal transport. Breaking and twisting of MTs have been previously observed in damaged undulated axons. Such <b>breaking</b> and <b>twisting</b> of MTs is suggested to cause axonal swellings that lead to axonal degeneration, which is known as “diffuse axonal injury”. In particular, overstretching and torsion of axons can potentially damage the axonal cytoskeleton. Following our previous studies on mechanical response of axonal MT bundles under uniaxial tension and compression, this work seeks to characterize the mechanical behavior of MT bundles under pure torsion as well as a combination of torsional and tensile loads using a coarse-grained computational model. In the case of pure torsion, a competition between MAP tau tensile and MT bending energies is observed. After three turns, a transition occurs in the mechanical behavior of the bundle that is characterized by its diameter shrinkage. Furthermore, crosslink spacing is shown to considerably influence the mechanical response, with larger MAP tau spacing resulting in a higher rate of turns. Therefore, MAP tau crosslinking of MT filaments protects the bundle from excessive deformation. Simultaneous application of torsion and tension on MT bundles is shown to accelerate bundle failure, compared to pure tension experiments. MAP tau proteins fail in clusters of 10 – 100 elements located at the discontinuities or the ends of MT filaments. This failure occurs in a stepwise fashion, implying gradual accumulation of elastic tensile energy in crosslinks followed by rupture. Failure of large groups of interconnecting MAP tau proteins leads to detachment of MT filaments from the bundle near discontinuities. This study highlights the importance of torsional loading in axonal damage after traumatic brain injury...|$|R
40|$|We {{present results}} for the isospin- 0 ππ s-wave {{scattering}} length calculated in twisted mass lattice QCD. We use three N_f = 2 ensembles with unitary pion mass at its physical value, 240 MeV and 330 MeV respectively. We also use a large set of N_f = 2 + 1 + 1 ensembles with unitary pion masses varying {{in the range of}} 230 MeV - 510 MeV at three different values of the lattice spacing. A mixed action approach with the Osterwalder-Seiler action in the valence sector is adopted to circumvent the complications arising from isospin symmetry <b>breaking</b> of the <b>twisted</b> mass quark action. Due to the relatively large lattice artefacts in the N_f = 2 + 1 + 1 ensembles, we do not present the scattering lengths for these ensembles. Instead, taking the advantage of the many different pion masses of these ensembles, we qualitatively discuss the pion mass dependence of the scattering properties of this channel based on the results from the N_f = 2 + 1 + 1 ensembles. The scattering length is computed for the N_f = 2 ensembles and the chiral extrapolation is performed. At the physical pion mass, our result M_π a^I= 0 _ 0 = 0. 198 (9) (6) agrees reasonably well with various experimental measurements and theoretical predictions.

There are a {{thousand}} {{ways in which}} it may have been done, the difficulty is not to account for the doing of it, but for the showing of it in some crystals and not in others You never by any chance get a quartz crystal broken or twisted in this way.

It is well known that by the movements of strata, portions of rock are often shattered to pieces:--well known also that agate is a deposit of flint by water under certain conditions of heat and pressure: there is, therefore, nothing wonderful in an agate's being broken; and nothing wonderful in its being mended with the solution out of which it was itself originally congealed. And with this explanation, most people, looking at a brecciated agate, or brecciated anything, seem to be satisfied. I was so myself, for twenty years; but, lately happening to stay for some time at the Swiss Baden, where the beach of the Limmat is almost wholly composed of brecciated limestones, I began to examine them thoughtfully; and perceived, in the end, that they were, one and all, knots of as rich mystery as any poor little human brain was ever lost in. That piece of agate in your hand, Mary, will show you many of the common phenomena of breccias; but you need not knit your brows over it in that way; depend upon it, neither you nor I shall ever know anything about the way it was made, as long as we live.|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{effects for}} J/Psi {{production}} in pA collisions {{are controlled by}} the coherence and color transparency effects. Color transparency onsets when the time of formation of the charmonium wave function becomes longer than the inter-nucleon spacing. In this energy regime the effective break-up cross section for a c-cbar dipole depends on energy and nuclear path length, and agrees well with data from fixed target experiments, both in magnitude and energy dependence. At higher energies of RHIC and LHC coherence in c-cbar pair production leads to charm quark shadowing which is a complement to the high <b>twist</b> <b>break</b> up cross section. These two effects explain well with no adjusted parameters the magnitude and rapidity dependence of nuclear suppression of J/Psi observed at RHIC in dAu collisions, while the contribution of leading twist gluon shadowing {{is found to be}} vanishingly small. A novel mechanism of double color filtering for c-cbar dipoles makes nuclei significantly more transparent in AA compared to pA collisions. This is one of the mechanisms which make impossible a model independent "data driven" extrapolation from pA to AA. This effect also explains the enhancement of nuclear suppression observed at forward rapidities in AA collisions at RHIC, what hardly can be related to the produced dense medium. J/Psi is found to be a clean and sensitive tool measuring the transport coefficient characterizing the dense matter created in AA collisions. RHIC data for pT dependence of J/Psi production in nuclear collisions are well explained with the low value of the transport coefficient q_ 0 -hat< 0. 5 GeV^ 2 /fm.

40|$|Chirality, or handedness, {{is a key}} concept {{spanning}} {{all fields}} of natural science, from biology to mathematics. Chiral structures can arise from achiral building blocks that lack a handedness if their assembly is unstable to chiral deformations, a phenomenon called spontaneous symmetry breaking. We theoretically study the role of chirality in two systems composed of liquid crystals dissolved or suspended in water, and our results match those obtained experimentally by our collaborators. In the first system, we study achiral liquid crystals whose Frank twist modulus is much lower than their splay and bend Frank moduli and which are confined in capillaries. Under homeotropic anchoring, their ground state configuration undergoes spontaneous chiral symmetry <b>breaking</b> when the <b>twist</b> modulus decreases enough relative to the splay and bend moduli. Under degenerate planar anchoring, a small twist-to-saddle-splay ratio of elastic moduli leads to degenerate twisted configurations even though an undeformed configuration is possible. Measuring the twist profile of an experimental system produces a value for the saddle-splay constant, which {{has been difficult to}} achieve previously. Under either boundary condition, domain walls and point defects, whose topological charges depend on chirality, separate domains with different degenerate configurations, and certain ones are energetically preferred over others. In the second system, we study filamentous viruses acting as colloidal liquid crystals under the influence of depletion, which promotes condensation of the viruses into 2 D colloidal monolayers. These membranes have tunable chirality and show a rich array of emergent behaviors, including a transition from a circular shape to a striking starfish shape upon changing the chirality of constituent viruses, partial coalescence via domain walls through which the viruses twist by 180 degrees, and phase-separated rafts of a particular size when two virus species with different lengths and opposite chiralities are used. We formulate a simple theory combining Frank elasticity and depletion that shows how entropy and chirality drive the formation and behavior of these diverse structures. Our work may facilitate the design of chiral sensors and reconfigurable materials and suggests that chirality contributes not only biochemically but also physically to the behavior of lipid rafts in biomembranes. ...|$|R
