5|$|While coach McGuire and Rosenbluth {{boarded a}} plane to New York to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show, {{the rest of the}} Tar Heels {{returned}} to North Carolina two days later when they landed at Raleigh–Durham International Airport (RDU). The North Carolina squad was greeted by over 10,000 fans. Some players were carried by members of the crowd from the airport ramp to the terminal. The airport manager believed the crowd gathered to meet the Tar Heels was the biggest in RDU's history. The crowd was so <b>big</b> <b>that</b> it prevented Chancellor Robert House from giving a planned speech for the team. The large crowd at the airport was credited to the airing of both the national semifinal and National Championship game on television around North Carolina. The 1957 North Carolina team were awarded watches for their victory in the national championship. In the 1990s, the team was given rings to commemorate their win in the national championship game after then North Carolina coach Dean Smith insisted upon giving the team rings. Coach McGuire was given a brand new Carolina blue and white Cadillac by the university, as well as being signed to a new fiveyear contract that gave him $11,500 per year.|$|E

So God {{delivered}} King Og of Bashan, his men, and his 60 towns into the Israelites' hands, and they left no survivor.

25|$|The {{construction}} material used for ab anbars were very tough and extensively used a special mortar called sarooj {{which was made}} of sand, clay, egg whites, lime, goat hair, and ash in specific proportions, depending on location and climate of the city. This mixture {{was thought to be}} completely water impenetrable. The walls of the storage were often 2 meters thick, and special bricks had to be used. These bricks were especially baked for ab anbars and were called Ajor Ab anbari. Some ab anbars were so <b>big</b> <b>that</b> they would be built underneath caravanserais such as the ab anbar of Haj Agha Ali in Kerman. Sometimes they would also be built under mosques, such as the ab anbar of Vazir near Isfahan.|$|E
25|$|In less {{developed}} countries, some traditional fishing villages persist {{in ways that}} have changed little from earlier times. In more developed countries, traditional fishing villages are changing due to socioeconomic factors like industrial fishing and urbanization. Over time, some fishing villages outgrow their original function as artisanal fishing villages. Seven hundred years ago, Shanghai, beside the Yangtze River delta, was a small fishing village. In recent times, fishing villages have been increasingly targeted for tourist and leisure enterprises. Recreational fishing and leisure boat pursuits can be big business these days, and traditional fishing villages are often well positioned {{to take advantage of}} this. For example, Destin on the coast of Florida, has evolved from an artisanal fishing village into a seaside resort dedicated to tourism with a large fishing fleet of recreational charter boats. The tourist appeal of fishing villages has become so <b>big</b> <b>that</b> the Korean government is purpose-building 48 fishing villages for their tourist drawing power. In 2004 China reported it had 8,048 fishing villages.|$|E

In a December 1990 {{interview}} with The New York Times, Elfman criticized the growing tendency to use digital technology for sound design and dubbing purposes. [...] "I detest contemporary scoring and dubbing in cinema. Film music as an art took a deep plunge when Dolby stereo hit.

500|$|Director Christopher Nolan {{worked with}} Pacino on Insomnia, {{a remake of}} the Norwegian film of the same name, co-starring Robin Williams.

The film and Pacino's {{performance}} were well received, gaining a favorable rating of 93 percent on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. The film did moderately well at the box office, taking in $113 million worldwide. His next film, S1m0ne, did not gain much critical praise or box office success.|$|E

Ivar was killed on an campaign with King Harald Finehair, {{which resulted in the}} Norðreyar being gifted to his family as compensation. Hrólfr [...] "was so <b>big</b> <b>that</b> no horse could carry him", hence his byname of [...] "Göngu-Hrólf" [...] ("Hrólf the Walker"), and he is identified by the saga writers with Rollo, ancestor of the Dukes of Normandy.

50|$|Another {{situation}} {{is when the}} adjective itself has a modifier that comes after it; that is, when the noun or pronoun is in fact modified by an adjective phrase in which the head adjective is not final. Such phrases as <b>bigger</b> than <b>that,</b> proud of themselves, anxious to leave, if used attributively, would normally have to come after the noun, as in we need a box <b>bigger</b> than <b>that</b> (not *a <b>bigger</b> than <b>that</b> box, although it is possible in this case to say a <b>bigger</b> box than <b>that).</b> Exceptions include certain established phrases such as easy-to-use and variations thereof, {{which can be used}} as if they were single adjectives before the noun. Phrases in which the adjective is followed only by enough also often appear before the noun. Conversely, some phrases in which the adjective is final, such as this <b>big</b> and <b>that</b> ugly, tend to follow the noun.|$|R

500|$|... "Deep Space Homer" [...] {{was written}} by then-executive {{producer}} David Mirkin. Mirkin had worked on {{the idea for the}} episode for a long time, basing the story on NASA's Teacher in Space Project to send ordinary civilians into space in order to spark interest amongst the general public. There was some controversy amongst the show's writing staff during production. Some of the writers felt that having Homer go into space was too large an idea. Matt Groening felt that the idea was so <b>big</b> <b>that</b> it gave the writers [...] "nowhere to go". Several silly gags were therefore toned down to make the episode feel more realistic, including an idea that everyone at NASA was as stupid as Homer. The writers focused more upon the relationship between Homer and his family and Homer's attempts to be a hero.|$|E

500|$|The joke, {{which plays}} on the {{similarity}} of the phrases [...] "fishsticks" [...] and [...] "fish dicks" [...] when spoken, becomes a hit throughout South Park. When Cartman begins taking half credit for the joke, Kyle tells Jimmy he should stand up to Cartman. When Jimmy tells Cartman he feels he wrote most of the joke, Cartman fears Jimmy will try to take full credit and asks Kyle for {{advice on how to}} deal with Jimmy. Kyle instead says he believes Jimmy wrote the entire joke, and suggests that Cartman's ego is so <b>big</b> <b>that</b> he subconsciously remembers things incorrectly to make himself feel more important. This is supplemented by Cartman's flashbacks to the creation of the joke, which become more overblown and ridiculous as the episode goes on, showing him to truly believe that he deserves credit.|$|E

500|$|Mirkin {{said that}} he [...] "brought [...] back to a more story-oriented" [...] {{approach}} and increased the character and emotion focus, while [...] "at the same time still keeping it surreal and weird". During his tenure, Mirkin moved the show's focus towards Homer, and developed some of the secondary characters, such as Apu. He also strongly opposed censorship and network interference. Mirkin's era and style of humor are popular amongst the show's fans, but the writing staff were divided on his style of humor, which saw the show move away from more [...] "realistic" [...] emotional and character based stories to [...] "pure comedy" [...] and [...] "surreal" [...] humor. The episode [...] "Deep Space Homer" [...] was controversial when the episode was in production.

500|$|In the {{advertising}} for the film, MGM boasted of the film's ostentatious nature, bragging {{that it was}} [...] "SO <b>BIG</b> <b>that</b> only MGM could handle it", with its [...] "countless beauties, trained lions, ponies, dogs and other animals". Busby Berkeley, who had led Warner Brothers to become the leading producer of musicals in Hollywood in the 1930s, was {{a major influence on}} the producers which had [...] "glamorous, excessive 1930s cinematic musical numbers". The film also came at a time when producers had begun seeing the economic and cultural importance of the cinematic medium in comparison to theater. Variety notes that the film producers were likely very concerned with the presentation of the film after production was wrapped up, and that the long length of the film at 176 minutes was understandable in that they probably [...] "wanted to preserve as much footage as possible". William S. Gray was responsible for the editing of the film. Over a thousand people were employed in the production, and The Great Ziegfeld required 16 reels of film after the cutting.|$|E
500|$|... "Habits (Stay High)" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by most critics. Harley Brown of Billboard {{wrote that the}} track is [...] "one of the most easily identifiable pop songs [...] heard in recent memory: everyone's gotten high, maybe eaten too many Twinkies, and regretted life decisions, but not everyone makes a really superb song about it". Pitchfork's Carrie Battam stated that the track's hook and production make the lyrics [...] "sound gracefully sad instead of tragic". In her review of Queen of the Clouds, Battam called it [...] "a big, sticky song, but not so <b>big</b> <b>that</b> it stuns your senses or numbs you into enjoyment". [...] Ewald Arndt of FDRMX said that [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is [...] "so fun to listen to" [...] despite its sad themes. AllMusic's Heather Phares called it [...] "the Queen of the Cloudss standout track, while Sam Lansky of Idolator stated that it [...] "has {{a little of the}} texture of Kesha's no-fucks-given party-girl pop but with the languorous sadness of Robyn" [...] and that [...] "It'll get stuck in your head, which is right where it deserves to be." [...] Nick Murray labeled it as Truth Serums best track, and compared it with the music of American rapper Kendrick Lamar.|$|E
