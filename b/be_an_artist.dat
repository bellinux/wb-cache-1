Her frustration stems from her unhappy home life; {{she lives in}} a public housing estate with her brother Tiny and their single father, Sandro.

5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E
5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist.</b>|$|E

25|$|He {{wanted to}} <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> or illustrator, {{but he was}} often {{discouraged}} by societal norms of Japan which favored finding safe, well-paying jobs. He was discouraged because his uncle was an artist who suffered from financial difficulties. Another reason was his father's death which left his family more financially tight. He eventually started writing short stories and began {{to send them to}} Japanese magazines but was not able to get anything published. He cites that his stories were often 400 pages long while most magazines wanted their short stories to be around 100 pages. Eventually, he shifted his focus to making films with his friend who had an 8mm camera.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the divorce}} {{from his first}} wife in 1926, Sir James Dunn married Irene Clarice Richards, the former wife of Francis Archibald Kelhead Douglas, 11th Marquess of Queensberry. The 1928 death of his {{daughter}} Mona Dunn {{from his first marriage}} sent him into a state of depression and for a time he thought about cutting back on his business activities and returning home to his native New Brunswick. However, in 1929, his new wife gave birth to a daughter, Anne, who lifted his spirits a great deal. Anne Dunn grew up to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist,</b> studying under Henry Moore and in Paris, France with Fernand Léger and at the Académie Julian. Nevertheless, Dunn and his second wife divorced in 1942 following which he married his long-time personal secretary, Marcia Anastasia Christoforides. Thirty-six years his junior, “Christofor” as she was nicknamed, was very bright, intensely loyal, and a devoted partner. James Dunn would seek her input on most every business matter {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} is unfinished. Zoffany {{is thought to}} have based the painting on another made of Cook's death by John Webber who was the official artist on Cook's third voyage. Zoffany had been invited at one time to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> on one of Cook's voyages and it is thought that he may have previously painted Cook. Webber had not witnessed the death of Cook, but he would have known many of the people involved. He would have known the English sailors but he would also have seen many of the natives. When Cook and his men visited Hawaii for the second time they spent some time on the main island of Hawaii where he had been received many gifts from the Hawaiian Chief including a feather cape and feathered helmet. Cook had been killed when he returned to Hawaii only two weeks after his second visit. His unplanned return to the island was due to a storm. Cook angered the native people by attempting to take the local chief, Kalaniʻōpuʻu, as a hostage {{in order to get a}} missing boat returned. In the confusion, Cook shot a man and in the aftermath he and four marines were speared to death; the death appears unintended. Cook's replacement, Captain Clerke, was able to very quickly reestablish a relationship with the Hawaiians, and they left with little ill will.|$|E

[...] Pond attended the public schools in Ann Arbor before enrolling at the University of Michigan.|$|E
500|$|The {{music was}} {{developed}} immediately following {{a brief period}} in the mid 1960s where creative authenticity among musical artists and consumer marketing coincided with each other. Before the progressive pop of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable {{to decide on the}} artistic content of their music. Assisted by the mid 1960s economic boom, record labels began investing in artists, giving them freedom to experiment, and offering them limited control over their content and marketing. The growing student market serviced record labels with the word [...] "progressive", being adopted as a marketing term to differentiate their product from [...] "commercial" [...] pop. Music critic Simon Reynolds writes that beginning with 1967, a divide would exist between [...] "progressive" [...] pop and [...] "mass/chart" [...] pop, a separation which was [...] "also, broadly, one between boys and girls, middle-class and working-class." [...] Before progressive/art rock became the most commercially successful British sound of the early 1970s, the 1960s psychedelic movement brought together art and commercialism, broaching the question of what it meant to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> in a mass medium. Progressive musicians thought that artistic status depended on personal autonomy, and so the strategy of [...] "progressive" [...] rock groups was to present themselves as performers and composers [...] "above" [...] normal pop practice.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Knock You Down", {{directed}} by Chris Robinson, premiered on March 23, 2009. The video begins with Hilson slowly falling backwards onto a bed, and then West appears and raps the introduction. Both start reflecting on their previous relationship, before the clip flashes {{back to the}} previous events. West is shown to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist,</b> who is painting a portrait of Hilson. Hilson and West begin to caress each other, as she as shown in several seductive poses in a bed and sings {{in front of a}} white backdrop. The video returns to the present, showing Hilson and West breaking up, as both of them fall backwards onto the floor, similar to the way Hilson falls onto the bed in the opening sequence. Visual effects come into play greater in this scene, as when West falls, he shatters into pieces. Ne-Yo then appears, and sings his lines in front of a grey backdrop. Ne-Yo and Hilson proceed to go on a date at a party in West and Hilson's apartment, and are seen being affectionate by West. He then confronts Hilson, and Ne-Yo also approaches the duo before Hilson walks off, torn between the two men. The clip ends with Hilson falling backwards onto a bed, in similar fashion as the opening scene.|$|E

500|$|... "Welcome to the Occupation" [...] {{is about}} a teacher limited with his career who strives to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist.</b> Willett was {{inspired}} by his job as an English high school teacher in Torrance to write the song, saying that it didn't give him [...] "a lot of creative space to really be very inspired to be a teacher." [...] "Golden Gate Jumpers" [...] {{is about a}} woman who goes to the Golden Gate Bridge and contemplates taking her life away. The tracks [...] "Avalanche in B" [...] and [...] "I've Seen Enough" [...] were originally conceived by the band as one-long track but instead cut into two songs. The former uses snow as a metaphor for how bleak and empty life is when it is coming straight towards you. The latter was created during a jam session in which the band played one continuous chord progression that stuck with them throughout the session. [...] "Every Man I Fall For" [...] is about a woman's perspective on relationships. Inspired by his own mother's relationship with men, Willett saw something he could craft from that emotion, saying that it stuck with him as having importance [...] "because it was something I always saw in relationships; like my mom being a single mother and seeing how men treat these women and how they operate in relationships." ...|$|E
500|$|Brosnan {{also raises}} money for {{charitable}} causes through sales of his paintings. After Brosnan left school, he pursued {{a career in}} art and began working as an illustrator. “I always wanted to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist,</b> a painter. I started as a Trainee Artist in a small studio in South London.” A colleague suggested that Pierce attend a theatre workshop, and eventually he abandoned his artwork {{to pursue a career}} in acting. Brosnan took up painting again in the late 1980s during his first wife’s illness as he found it therapeutic. “Sometimes dramatic moments affect the way you see yourself in the world…from a very hard time in my life, I started painting again and out came every color I could imagine.” Citing his influences as Picasso, Matisse, Bonnard and Kandinsky, Brosnan spends much of his free time between film shoots in front of his easel. “I am self taught, an enthusiastic painter as a friend of mine likes to say.” [...] He has continued painting since then, using spare time on set and at home. Profits from sales of giclée prints of his works are given to a trust to benefit [...] "environmental, children's and women's health charities." [...] Since Harris' death, Brosnan has been an advocate for cancer awareness and, in 2006, he served as spokesperson for Lee National Denim Day, a breast cancer fundraiser which raises millions of dollars and raises more money in a single day than any other breast cancer fundraiser.|$|E

Robert Christgau remarked on its place in his solo career, [...] "In 1996, Saadiq turned the climactic Tony! Toni! Toné! album into a virtuoso history lesson. Six years later, he tried to dazzle Maxwell in his own reflected glory. Six years later yet again, he outd himself with a fearless return to retro."
