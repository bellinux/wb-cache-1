5000|$|<b>Blossom-end</b> <b>rot</b> {{is another}} sign of plant disease that may {{accompany}} blackheart in the same plant. A black rot originates opposite the stem area of the plant fruit (the [...] "blossom-end") and spreads over the fruit as a dark, hardened area.

5000|$|The {{most common}} cause of <b>blossom-end</b> <b>rot</b> and/or {{blackheart}} is exposure to a prolonged hot, or drought period. These plant pathologies may also be caused by an extremely low calcium mineral content in the soil.|$|E
50|$|The first {{symptom of}} <b>blossom-end</b> <b>rot</b> is soft, wet, and reddish discolorations {{that appear in}} the late summer months. As the rot stops growing it will begin to dry out and appear sunken. The {{affected}} fruit will often drop prematurely. Fungicide experiments have shown reduced incidence, from 5% to less than 0.5%, with treatment.|$|E
50|$|Plant {{fruit that}} is afflicted by either <b>blossom-end</b> <b>rot</b> or {{blackheart}} should be picked and discarded, leaving the healthy fruit on the plant. While {{the condition is}} not contagious {{and it will not}} spread from fruit to fruit, removing affected fruit will enable the plant to concentrate strength towards the healthier parts of the plant. Additional water should be added to a plant suffering from the effects of a hot, dry spell. If low calcium in the soil is the cause, this can be treated with calcium-rich fertilizers, such as gypsum, limestone, or ground eggshells.|$|E

The aim of this paper was to evaluate the influence calcium and ammonium on the productivity and blossom-end of tomatoes grown hydroponically. The experiment was carried out in the green house of the Department of Agronomy of the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, and consisted of factorial arrangement between six levels of calcium and two levels of ammonium in the nutrient solution (6 x 2), with six replications in experimental design of randomized blocks. Calcium treatments were the concentrations of 120, 140, 170, 200, 240 and 280 mg L- 1, and ammonium treatments were the absence of this cation in the nutrient solution and the addition of 28. 4 mg L- 1, corresponding to 15 % of total-N of the nutrient solution. The <b>blossom-end</b> <b>rot,</b> productivity, fruit diameter and number of fruits were evaluated. The data were submitted to the analysis of the variance and regression.

40|$|Background The {{incidence}} of <b>blossom-end</b> <b>rot</b> (BER) is generally {{associated with a}} calcium (Ca) deficiency in the distal portion of tomato fruits. The visible symptom is a necrotic lesion, which is presumed to be a consequence of cell death and the subsequent leakage of solutes into the extracellular space. Environmental factors that affect either fruit cell expansion or Ca delivery to the distal portion of the fruit influence the occurrence of BER. However, since no absolute, critical fruit Ca concentration for the occurrence of BER has been identified, it is now important to define the role of Ca in fruit cell physiology and to seek the cause of BER at the cellular level. ...|$|E

Positive influence of biostimulant treatment on yield parameters was observed along with significant decrease in incidence of <b>blossom-end</b> <b>rot</b> (BER) in two pepper cultivars. Biostimulants application resulted in overall increase in macro- and microelement content in fruits of treated pepper cultivars. Generally, biostimulants improved the yield of pepper plants grown hydroponically by increasing the nutrient uptake and decreasing the occurrence of BER.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of a two-year study {{assessing}} the effects of nitrogen fertilization and irrigation regimes on yield traits and on water and nitrogen use efficiency of greenhouse-grown bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). The trials involved the combination of four N doses (0, 100, 200, 300 kg ha- 1) with two irrigation regimes (100 % resti-tution of ETc; repeated cycles of water stress starting from fruit set). In the second year, the crop was transplant-ed one month earlier than in the first year and was mulched with plastic sheeting. The highest yield in both years was obtained by associating 100 % restitution of ETc and the N dose of 200 kg ha- 1. The marketable yields were 37 and 72 t ha- 1 in 1998 and 1999, respectively. Doubling of the yield in the second year was probably due to the earlier transplantation and mulching, confirming the numerous benefits of the latter technique. The water deficit imposed during the late flowering-early fruit set phase had negative effects on the crop, with declines of the marketable yield of up to 44 % due to the reduced number and weight of the fruit and the in-creased waste, mainly peppers with <b>blossom-end</b> <b>rot,</b> cracking, sun-burn and malformations. The peppers grown un-der water stress were richer in dry matter and soluble solids. The yield declines due to water deficit varied in re-lation to the N dose, as confirmed by the numerous interactions recorded between irrigation regime and nitrogen level.

Medium-fruited tomato plants were cultivated in spring up to the 10 th truss. In the first experiment, a 1 / 5, 000 a wagner pot was used, and small openings were made 5 mm or 50 mm {{from the bottom of}} the pots. Capillary wicks, 4 cm in width and 45 cm in length were inserted into the slits and aligned to the pot’s inner wall perpendicularly to the soil surface. The other end of the wick was dipped in half or full strength Ohtsuka-A nutrient solution. The wick was covered with water permeable root-barrier material to prevent root penetration into wick. This resulted in good growth and relatively high yield. Without covering, roots grew vigorously into the wicks and 1 month after transplanting extended to the reservoir solution. Removal of root overgrowth caused wilting in some of the plants. This symptom was more pronounced where the wick insertion points were 50 mm from the base. Root contexture was observed in non-covered and imperfectly covered wicks. These results indicate that it is important to make a wick with a perfect covering for stable plant growth and fruit yield. In the second experiment, the capacity of 2 cm or 4 cm wide with and single or double layers of capillary wicks to transport water to the plant root-zone was examined. Some of the plants wilted in the 2 cm single layer, while no differences were observed in other treatments. Furthermore, a high percentage of <b>blossom-end</b> <b>rot</b> was recorded in all treatments. In response to water uptake by the plants, the nutrient solution was supplied daily depending on the decrease of water in the reservoir, in order to maintain the water level fluctuation within a 3 cm range. This fluctuation may account for the <b>blossom-end</b> <b>rot</b> prevalence observed, probably due to water-stress imposed on the plants by unstable water level in the reservoir. 「毛管給水ひも」によるトマト栽培の可能性を探るため，中玉トマトの 10 段摘心栽培を試み，ひもの特性と栽培上の問題点を明らかにした． 1 / 5, 000 ａワグネルポットの底から 5 ㎜位と 50 ㎜位に小穴を開け，そこへ毛管ひも（幅 4 ㎝，長さ 45 ㎝）の一端を導入し，そのまま鉢中央を横切り対壁に沿って土壌表面まで配置した．他の一端は培養液に浸した．この毛管ひもを遮根透水シートで被覆し（接着あるいは機械織りによるチューブ状管にひもを挿入），その「被覆ひも」を「無被覆ひも」と比較したところ，被覆ひもでは根の侵入が強く抑制でき成育が旺盛で収量も高かった．被覆しないと 1 か月後には根が毛管ひも内に伸長して貯液槽にまで達した．この根を除去すると多くの個体は萎れの症状を呈した．この症状は 50 ㎜位の方が著しかった．被覆が不完全だと接着部あるいは織り込み部から根は毛管ひもに侵入する．従って，毛管ひもは完全被覆されることが重要であるといえる．また，遮根透水ひもを 2 ㎝幅， 4 ㎝幅としシングル状とダブル状で比較したところ，成育半ばでシングル 2 ㎝幅では萎れ症状が観察され枯死する個体も現れた．その 他では成育等に大きな差異は認められなかったが，いずれの処理区においても多くの尻腐れ果が発生した．トマトの吸水に伴って水位は低下するため本試験では毎日，培養液を手で補給した．しかし，水位変化は最大で 3 ㎝と大きかった．尻腐れ果発生はこの液槽の水位レベル管理に起因するところ大と推察され，今後の課題として残された...|$|E

In order to investigate the interaction effect of salinity and nitrogen on tomato growth, fruit quality, and micronutrient concentration in tomato plants, a hydroponic experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with three replications. Treatments included 3 salinity levels (0, 30 and 60 mM), and 3 nitrogen rates (0, 1. 5, and 3 mM).

40|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} shoot pruning (one or two stems) and inflorescence thinning (five or ten flowers per inflorescence) on greenhouse tomato yield and fruit quality were studied {{during the dry}} season (DS) and rainy season (RS) in Central Thailand. Poor fruit set, development of undersized (mostly parthenocarpic) fruits, as well as the physiological disorders <b>blossom-end</b> <b>rot</b> (BER) and fruit cracking (FC) {{turned out to be the}} prevailing causes deteriorating fruit yield and quality. The proportion of marketable fruits was less than 10 % in the RS and around 65 % in the DS. In both seasons, total yield was significantly increased when plants were cultivated with two stems, resulting in higher marketable yields only in the DS. While the fraction of undersized fruits was increased in both seasons when plants were grown with a secondary stem, the proportions of BER and FC were significantly reduced. Restricting the number of flowers per inflorescence invariably resulted in reduced total yield. However, in neither season did fruit load considerably affect quantity or proportion of the marketable yield fraction. Inflorescence thinning tended to promote BER and FC, an effect which was only significant for BER in the RS. In conclusion, for greenhouse tomato production under climate conditions as they are prevalent in Central Thailand, the cultivation with two stems appears to be highly recommendable whereas the measures to control fruit load tested in this study did not proof to be advisable.

40|$|The {{effect of}} 3 {{substrate}} humidity levels {{on the growth}} and yield of 2 sweet pepper hybrids, established under greenhouse conditions, was evaluated. The experiment {{was held in the}} industrial greenhouse of the Fabio Baudrit Moreno Experimental Research Station, in La Garita (Alajuela), and the materials evaluated were the hybrids Villaplants Americano (square yellow fruit, bell type) and FBM- 9 (triangular red fruit type), both national origin genotypes. The first treatment was to supply water at container capacity (CC) to the plant, while the second and third ones were reducing 15 and 30 %, respectively, of the plant original water supply. It was demonstrated that there is no effect due to the amount of water supply on the plant´s growth, although it was observed that hydric- stressed plants were the first to begin the flowering and fruiting phase. In both hybrids, a reduction in the amount of first and second one amount quality fruit and an increasing of fruit rejected as the watering was limited. <b>Blossom-end</b> <b>rot</b> was the main rejection cause due to the water loss, associated with low calcium availability. The highest commercial yield was obtained with the Villaplants Americano hibryd (31, 8 ton. ha- 1), although without statistical difference between substrates at CC and CC– 15 %, despite a fruit quality reduction with the later treatment. The same was observed with the FBM- 9 hybrid. With the CC– 30 % treatment, both commercial yield and fruit quality were affected, in both hybrids. </span...|$|E
40|$|Tomato {{production}} is at second place among vegetable crops in Brazil in economical relevance. The {{aim of this}} research was to evaluate silicon, nitrogen and potassium effect on yield. The experiment was carried out at FAL-UnB in a completely randomized design, with 14 forms of fertilization (control - no fertilization; 2, 4, 6 and 8 kg ha- 1 of SiO 2; 60, 120, 180 e 240 kg ha- 1 of nitrogen; 100, 200, 300 e 400 kg ha- 1 of K 2 O; NPK according to soil analyses), three genotypes (Viradoro, Tospodoro and HEI 035) in two periods of evaluation/ harvest, totalizing 84 treatments, in four replicates, in a total of 336 experimental parcels. A MAPA norm was used to evaluate yield and classify fruits. The lowest fertilizers doses in each nutrient resulted in the highest yield of adequate tomato fruits for processing. HEI 035 showed the lowest discolored and insect damaged fruits, statistically different from those observed on the other genotypes. Nevertheless, HEI 035 showed the highest fruit number with black heart disorder, statistically different from Tospodoro´s result, which was the lowest. The highest number of cracked fruits in each nutrient dose was observed at the lowest dose, and did not differ statistically from control, but differed from NPK that showed the lowest result. HEI 035 showed the highest number of <b>blossom-end</b> <b>rot</b> fruits. It can be concluded that the lowest fertilizer doses in each fertilizer (silicon, nitrogen and potassium) result in the highest yield of adequate tomato fruits for processing...|$|E
40|$|Here we {{demonstrate}} that fruit from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) plants expressing Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) H+/cation exchangers (CAX) have more calcium (Ca 2 +) and prolonged shelf life {{when compared to}} controls. Previously, using the prototypical CAX 1, it has been demonstrated that, in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells, CAX transporters are activated when the N-terminal autoinhibitory region is deleted, to give an N-terminally truncated CAX (sCAX), or altered through specific manipulations. To continue to understand the diversity of CAX function, we used yeast assays to characterize the putative transport properties of CAX 4 and N-terminal variants of CAX 4. CAX 4 variants can suppress the Ca 2 + hypersensitive yeast phenotypes and also {{appear to be more}} specific Ca 2 + transporters than sCAX 1. We then compared the phenotypes of sCAX 1 - and CAX 4 -expressing tomato lines. The sCAX 1 -expressing tomato lines demonstrate increased vacuolar H+/Ca 2 + transport, when measured in root tissue, elevated fruit Ca 2 + level, and prolonged shelf life but have severe alterations in plant development and morphology, including increased incidence of <b>blossom-end</b> <b>rot.</b> The CAX 4 -expressing plants demonstrate more modest increases in Ca 2 + levels and shelf life but no deleterious effects on plant growth. These findings suggest that CAX expression may fortify plants with Ca 2 + and may serve {{as an alternative to the}} application of CaCl 2 used to extend the shelf life of numerous agriculturally important commodities. However, judicious regulation of CAX transport is required to assure optimal plant growth...|$|E
40|$|Rockwool (RC) and peat are {{two common}} {{substrates}} used worldwide in horticultural crop production. In recent years environmental and ecological concerns raised {{the demand for}} reducing the use of RC and peat. Although coconut coir (CC) has been increasingly used {{as an alternative to}} RC and peat, it is still needed to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility of CC before widely used. To meet this need, CC, RC, and peat-vermiculite (PVC) cultivations were used as tomato cultivation substrates to evaluate their effects on EC, pH and mineral ions in root-zone solution and drainage, nutrient uptake by crops, nutrient balance of cultivation system, plant growth and fruit quality. In general, CC significantly increased K and S uptake by crops, photosynthesis, individual fruit weight and total fruit yield compared to RC, and increased P and K uptake by crops and total fruit yield compared to PVC. Moreover, CC significantly increased organic acid of fruit in first truss compared to both RC and PVC. The uncredited nutrient was overally lower under CC than under RC and PVC (the lower, the better). For all substrates, the <b>blossom-end</b> <b>rot</b> (BER) of fruit increased gradually from 3 rd to 13 th trusses. The BER of fruit was not significantly influenced by CC compared to RC or PVC, but was sginificantly decreased by PVC compared to RC. Our results infer that CC was a potential substrate that could be widely used in tomato production. However, the inhibition of BER was still a challenge when CC was used as cultivation substrate for tomato...|$|E
