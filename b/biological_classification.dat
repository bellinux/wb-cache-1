5|$|<b>Biological</b> <b>classification</b> is a {{critical}} component of the taxonomic process. As a result, it informs the user as to what the relatives of the taxon are hypothesized to be. <b>Biological</b> <b>classification</b> uses taxonomic ranks, including among others (in order from most inclusive to least inclusive): Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species.|$|E
5|$|Systematic botany {{is part of}} {{systematic}} biology, which {{is concerned with the}} range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history. It involves, or is related to, <b>biological</b> <b>classification,</b> scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics. <b>Biological</b> <b>classification</b> is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species. <b>Biological</b> <b>classification</b> is a form of scientific taxonomy. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the International Botanical Congress.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of such fields of study as phylogenetics, cladistics, and systematics, the Linnaean system has progressed {{to a system of}} modern <b>biological</b> <b>classification</b> based on the {{evolutionary}} relationships between organisms, both living and extinct.|$|E
50|$|Johann Jakob von Kaup (10 April 1803 - 4 July 1873) was a German naturalist. A {{proponent of}} natural philosophy, he {{believed}} in an innate mathematical order in nature and he attempted <b>biological</b> <b>classifications</b> based on the Quinarian system. Kaup is also known for having coined popular prehistoric taxa like Pterosauria and Machairodus.|$|R
50|$|A food {{group is}} a {{collection}} of foods that share similar nutritional properties or <b>biological</b> <b>classifications.</b> Nutrition guides typically divide foods into food groups and recommend daily servings of each group for a healthy diet. In the United States for instance, USDA has described food as being in from 4 to 11 different groups.|$|R
50|$|Dupré is also {{concerned}} with the handling of <b>biological</b> taxonomy. <b>Biological</b> <b>classifications</b> are made by humans, and are thus open to criticism and modification. This applies in particular to the classifications of humans - for instance after race or sex. Dupré's arguments in this area reflect and mirror the sentiments and criticism of evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould.|$|R
5|$|In <b>biological</b> <b>classification</b> {{humans are}} animals, a basic point {{which has been}} known for more than 2,000 years. The creationist J. Rendle-Short {{asserted}} in Creation magazine that if people are taught evolution they can be expected to behave like animals: since animals behave in all sorts of different ways, this is meaningless. In evolutionary terms, humans are able to acquire knowledge and change their behaviour to meet social standards, so humans behave in the manner of other humans.|$|E
5|$|Historia Plantarum {{was written}} some time between c. 350 BC and c. 287 BC in ten volumes, of which nine survive. In the book, Theophrastus {{described}} plants by their uses, and attempted a <b>biological</b> <b>classification</b> {{based on how}} plants reproduced, a first {{in the history of}} botany. He continually revised the manuscript, and it remained in an unfinished state on his death. The condensed style of the text, with its many lists of examples, indicate that Theophrastus used the manuscript as the working notes for lectures to his students, rather than intending it to be read as a book.|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} {{was among the}} first animals to be given a {{scientific}} name in the modern system of <b>biological</b> <b>classification,</b> since it was described by Carl Linnaeus, in the 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae.

5|$|Most mammals, {{including}} the six most species-rich orders, {{belong to the}} placental group. The three largest orders in numbers of species are Rodentia: mice, rats, porcupines, beavers, capybaras and other gnawing mammals; Chiroptera: bats; and Soricomorpha: shrews, moles and solenodons. The next three biggest orders, depending on the <b>biological</b> <b>classification</b> scheme used, are the Primates {{including the}} apes, monkeys and lemurs; the Cetartiodactyla including whales and even-toed ungulates; and the Carnivora which includes cats, dogs, weasels, bears, seals and allies. According to Mammal Species of the World, 5,416 species were identified in 2006. These were grouped into 1,229 genera, 153 families and 29 orders. In 2008, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) completed a five-year Global Mammal Assessment for its IUCN Red List, which counted 5,488 species.|$|E
5|$|The Protestant Reformation {{inspired}} a literal {{interpretation of the}} Bible, with concepts of creation that conflicted {{with the findings of}} an emerging science seeking explanations congruent with the mechanical philosophy of René Descartes and the empiricism of the Baconian method. After the turmoil of the English Civil War, the Royal Society wanted to show that science did not threaten religious and political stability. John Ray developed an influential natural theology of rational order; in his taxonomy, species were static and fixed, their adaptation and complexity designed by God, and varieties showed minor differences caused by local conditions. In God's benevolent design, carnivores caused mercifully swift death, but the suffering caused by parasitism was a puzzling problem. The <b>biological</b> <b>classification</b> introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 also viewed species as fixed according to the divine plan. In 1766, Georges Buffon suggested that some similar species, such as horses and asses, or lions, tigers, and leopards, might be varieties descended from a common ancestor. The Ussher chronology of the 1650s had calculated creation at 4004BC, but by the 1780s geologists assumed a much older world. Wernerians thought strata were deposits from shrinking seas, but James Hutton proposed a self-maintaining infinite cycle, anticipating uniformitarianism.|$|E

The pre-classical period, which began around 1860, focused on collecting information about humans’ use of resources, while the classical period, which began in 1954, produced anthropological studies on linguistics and <b>biological</b> <b>classifications.</b> The current period, or post-classical period, {{has been described as a}} meeting of social science and the study of natural resources.|$|R

25|$|Systems of {{classification}} {{such as this}} one are primarily of value to malacologists (people who study mollusks) and other biologists. <b>Biological</b> <b>classification</b> schemes are not merely a convenience, they are an attempt to show the actual phylogeny (the evolutionary relatedness) within a group of organisms.

25|$|Negroid (also {{known as}} Congoid) is a {{grouping}} {{of human beings}} historically regarded as a biological taxon. The term {{has been used by}} forensic and physical anthropologists to refer to individuals and populations that share certain morphological and skeletal traits that are frequent among populations in most of Sub-Saharan Africa and isolated parts of South-Southeast Asia (Negritos). First introduced in early racial science and anthropometry, Negroid denoted one of the three purported major races of humankind (alongside Caucasoid and Mongoloid). Many social scientists have argued that such analyses are rooted in sociopolitical and historical processes rather than in empirical observation. However, Negroid as a <b>biological</b> <b>classification</b> remains in use in forensic anthropology.|$|E
25|$|In 1819 William Sharp Macleay had {{published}} his {{ideas of the}} Quinarian system of <b>biological</b> <b>classification,</b> and Swainson soon became a noted and outspoken proponent. The Quinarian System fell out of favour, giving way to the rising popularity of the geographical theory of Hugh Edwin Strickland. Swainson was overworked by Dionysius Lardner, {{the publisher of the}} Cabinet Cyclopaedia and both Swainson and Macleay were derided for their support of the Quinarian system. Both proponents left Britain; Swainson emigrated to New Zealand and Macleay to Australia. An American visiting Australasia in the 1850s heard to his surprise that both Macleay and Swainson were living there, and imagined that they had been exiled to the Antipodes 'for the great crime of burdening zoology with a false though much laboured theory which has thrown so much confusion into the subject of its classification and philosophical study'.|$|E

500|$|As {{early as}} the 5th century BCE the Greek philosopher Hippo {{expressed}} the opinion that cultigens (as we call them now) were produced from wild plants {{as the result of}} the care bestowed on them by man, a revolutionary view at a time when they were regarded as the special creation and gift of the gods. In devising ways of classifying organisms the philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BCE) established the important idea of a fundamentum divisionis — the principle that groups can be progressively subdivided. This has been assumed in <b>biological</b> <b>classification</b> ever since and is congruent with the relatively recent idea of evolution as descent with modification. All <b>biological</b> <b>classification</b> follows this principle of groups within groups, known as a nested hierarchy, but this form of classification does not necessarily presuppose evolution. [...] The earliest scientific (rather than utilitarian) approach to plants is attributed to Aristotle's student Theophrastus (371–286 BCE), known as the [...] "father of botany". In his Enquiry into Plants Theophrastus described 480 kinds of plant, dividing the plant kingdom into trees, shrubs, undershrubs and herbs with further subdivision into wild and cultivated, flowering and non-flowering, deciduous or evergreen.|$|E

500|$|In the 17th century, the {{new method}} {{of modern science}} {{rejected}} the Aristotelian approach.

500|$|From the 16th century, it was {{the fashion}} for ladies to carry small toy-sized spaniels as they {{travelled}} around town.

Key moments in Bram Sto- ker’s Dracula and R. L. Stevenson’s Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde provide evidence for the animality of late Victorian gothic monsters. In an extended reading of Richard Marsh’s 1897 novel The Beetle, this essay shows how the liminality of the monster in late Victorian gothic fiction is rhetorically articulated as a figural aberration {{that can only be}} reabsorbed into the dominant discourse by the use of animal imagery.
