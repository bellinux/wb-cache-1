5|$|As of 2017, {{there are}} 190 {{universities}} in Turkey. Entry {{to higher education}} depends on the Student Selection and Placement System (ÖSYS). In 2008, the quota of admitted students was 600,000, compared to 1,700,000 who took the higher education exam in 2007. Except for the Open Education Faculties (AÖF) at Anadolu, Istanbul and Atatürk University; entrance is regulated by the national ÖSYS examination, after which high school graduates are assigned to universities according to their performance. According to the 2012–2013 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, the top university in Turkey is Middle East Technical University (in the 201–225 rank range), followed by Bilkent University and Koç University (both in the 226–250 range), Istanbul Technical University and Boğaziçi University (in the 276–300 bracket).

25|$|By the {{government}} decree of July 1998 the polytechnics started {{to offer a}} two-stage curriculum (the first three years conferring a bacharelato degree, the following two years a licenciatura bietápica degree); both are undergraduate degrees, but the universities were offering a single licentiate degree (licenciatura) of four to five years. This was changed with the <b>Bologna</b> <b>process</b> with {{a new system of}} three years for a bachelor's degree (licenciatura). Two additional years grant a master's degree (mestrado) which is conferred by the polytechnic institute under protocols with a partner university or alone when the polytechnic institution is in full compliance with the necessary requirements (proper research activity, doctoral teaching staff, and budget). The doctoral degree (doutoramento) is conferred only by the universities, as it always has been. By the time of the implementation of the <b>Bologna</b> <b>Process</b> (2006) in Portuguese higher education, 9.5% of the state-run polytechnic teaching staff had a doctorate degree in 2005 - 15% in 2007 after the <b>Bologna</b> <b>Process.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Bologna's</b> <b>process</b> and {{the opening}} of {{university}} teaching to new educational scenarios provide an opportunity for the implementation of innovative and active methodologies. This paper describes a practice implemented by the share and reuse of learning contents using streaming technology. Streaming technology was used since it promotes the support of pedagogical activity as a dynamic resource and oriented to a model of shared learning. The motivation beyond this idea was the share of teacher's efforts in the development of didactic resources that can be reused on identical curriculum classes on a later moment. Also, within different learning units, some concepts are considered wellknown, but they must be remembered specially if they are not used for some time. Didactical resources where developed and made available allowing and facilitating the student's revise needed. In these cases, only activities are changed. In this model, it is underlying the constructivist theory of learning: students are motivated to construct knowledge for themselves. It demonstrated to be an enhanced experience not only concerning the sharing of knowledge but also because it promotes a desired partnership inter-department. The possibility to make available these contents in an open access repository is a new challenge that it is being tested (e-Learning Repository, UMinho/TecMinho) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{was designed to}} examine the level of internationalization {{of higher education in}} terms of international student mobility in Georgia. The papers aims to explore Georgia as 1) the host country and 2) the country of origin of internationally mobile students, detect the most common problems and barriers existing in the process of recognizing the diplomas obtained at American and European Universities and validating Georgian educational documents abroad. The study revealed that Georgia, after implementing reforms and becoming a part of the Bologna system, is increasing its internationalization level, but there are many problems with the recognition of international education, {{as well as with the}} recognition and validation of Georgian educa-tion abroad, which harms the reputation of Georgian higher education system. It is quite obvious that many Higher Education Institutions in Georgia still do not have the capacity to meet the demands of international students, which results in low numbers, especially on the masters programs. The study concludes that the majority of Georgian educational documents issued after 2005 (after the new reforms and <b>Bologna</b> <b>processes</b> in higher education- HE), have no validation problems at American and European Universities, which stresses the fact that the quality of Georgian HEIs is increasing...|$|R

40|$|It {{is argued}} that {{university}} education has a moral and social function in society.

To serve society in this way safeguards are necessary: a separation from the state, giving institutional autonomy and academic freedom in teaching and research. With the rise of extreme free market capitalism and the "knowledge society", these safeguards are being eroded: national governments, partly through the ramifications of the <b>Bologna</b> convergence <b>process,</b> {{are in the process of}} moulding universities to the needs of the market, and now see the accommodation of students to the workplace as the principal, or indeed only, objective for a university education.

40|$|With the Lisbon and <b>Bologna</b> <b>processes,</b> studies {{completion}} and sustainable employability of students became priorities for European universities. For the Council of European Union, {{the share of}} 30 - 40 year olds with tertiary educational attainment {{should be at least}} 40 % by 2020. The young Luxembourg University needs to understand why some students choose to leave without a diploma. Our aim was to analyse the relationships between self-perceiving of the academic employability skills (AES), self-related global quality of life (GQoL) and satisfaction towards against university services (SUS) among persisting and non-persisting students. Design: All freshmen (947) from the three Faculties of Luxembourg University (Sciences & Technology, Law & Finances and Social Sciences) were invited to participate to a cross-sectional survey that took place at beginning of the second semester. Methods: The persisting students were requested to complete an online questionnaire and those who had dropped out during the first semester (non-registered for the second semester) were contacted to responding at the same questions including socio-demographics characteristics: age; sex; nationality (yes/no); work (yes/no); father’s and mother's occupational level and education. A discriminant analysis was undertaken using: the AES scale- 6 items (Cronbach’s alpha 0. 81); the level of GQoL (1 item, values from 1 “very bad” to 5 “very good”) and the SUS scale- 3 items (Cronbach’s alpha 0. 74). Findings: 99 persisting students and 68 dropouts have responding. There's no significant age difference between these 2 groups (mean 21. 12 years old). Dropouts are more likely young men (55. 9 % vs. 39. 4 % persisting, p = 0. 036) and have a job (58. 2 % vs. 3. 6 % persisting, p = 0. 000). Their GQoL is higher (83. 3 / 100 vs. 78. 1 / 100 persisting, p = 0. 032), but their AES are lower (55. 2 / 100 vs. 67. 3 / 100 persisting, p°= 0. 000). Among them, AES and SUS are positively correlated (correlation 0. 414; p = 0. 000). Conclusions: Contrary to what described in literature, dropouts are not older than persisting students. They’ve a poorer perception of their employability skills, they're less satisfied with university services (like reputation of university, of faculty and teaching quality). However, they've a better quality of life and much of them have a gainful work. These findings are in line with recent studies suggesting that perceptions of quality of higher education have an impact on students’ satisfaction and behavioral intentions. Further researches will determine nature of links between academic services, employability skills and dropout...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{concepts}} {{of learning and}} teaching appear somehow mixed although their use emphasizes {{who is at the}} center of the <b>process.</b> <b>Bologna</b> Declaration has put the stress on the “What students do? ” paradigm, shifting the center of the process to the student. Such paradigm also supports life long learning objectives. The remote laboratory concept provides a tool to sustain this shift towards a student-centric teaching approach. However, in engineering education, this means an additional stress on laboratories, as a result from the pressure to increase experimentation, and raises the question: how to handle overcrowded laboratories? Remote labs present a solution to this problem, allowing students to access experiments without time and location restrictions. Index Terms — e-learning, remote labs. I...|$|R
