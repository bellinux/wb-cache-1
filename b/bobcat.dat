5|$|<b>Bobcat</b> {{activities}} {{are confined to}} well-defined territories, which vary in size depending on the sex {{and the distribution of}} prey. The home range is marked with feces, urine scent, and by clawing prominent trees in the area. In its territory, the <b>bobcat</b> has numerous places of shelter, usually a main den, and several auxiliary shelters on the outer extent of its range, such as hollow logs, brush piles, thickets, or under rock ledges. Its den smells strongly of the <b>bobcat.</b>|$|E
5|$|Its {{population}} in Canada is limited due to both snow depth {{and the presence}} of the Canadian lynx. The <b>bobcat</b> does not tolerate deep snow, and waits out heavy storms in sheltered areas; it lacks the large, padded feet of the Canadian lynx and cannot support its weight on snow as efficiently. The <b>bobcat</b> is not entirely at a disadvantage where its range meets that of the larger felid: displacement of the Canadian lynx by the aggressive <b>bobcat</b> has been observed where they interact in Nova Scotia, while the clearing of coniferous forests for agriculture has led to a northward retreat of the Canadian lynx's range to the advantage of the <b>bobcat.</b> In northern and central Mexico, the cat is found in dry scrubland and forests of pine and oak; its range ends at the tropical southern portion of the country.|$|E
50|$|The 2005-06 Charlotte <b>Bobcats</b> {{season was}} Charlotte's 16th {{season in the}} National Basketball Association (NBA), and their second as the <b>Bobcats.</b> The <b>Bobcats</b> moved from the Charlotte Coliseum to the Charlotte <b>Bobcats</b> Arena. During their second season under the <b>Bobcats</b> name, they would become the fourth team to start out their season with three {{different}} overtime games within their first six games to start out the regular season.|$|R
50|$|The Mavericks and the Charlotte <b>Bobcats</b> {{agreed on}} a trade that sent Erick Dampier, Matt Carroll and Eduardo Nájera to the <b>Bobcats,</b> while the <b>Bobcats</b> sent Tyson Chandler and Alexis Ajinca to the Mavericks.|$|R
50|$|On March 14, 2013, Pargo {{signed a}} 10-day {{contract}} with the Charlotte <b>Bobcats.</b> On March 24, 2013, he signed a second 10-day {{contract with the}} <b>Bobcats,</b> and on April 3, 2013, he signed {{for the remainder of}} the season. On August 9, 2013, he re-signed with the <b>Bobcats.</b> In April 2014, the Charlotte <b>Bobcats</b> were renamed the Hornets.|$|R
5|$|The <b>bobcat</b> {{may have}} {{external}} parasites, mostly ticks and fleas, and often carries the parasites of its prey, {{especially those of}} rabbits and squirrels. Internal parasites (endoparasites) are especially common in bobcats. One study found an average infection rate of 52% from Toxoplasma gondii, but with great regional variation. One mite in particular, Lynxacarus morlani, has to date been found only on the <b>bobcat.</b> Parasites' and diseases' role in the mortality of the <b>bobcat</b> is still unclear, but they may account for greater mortality than starvation, accidents, and predation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bobcat</b> prey base {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} other midsized predators of a similar ecological niche. Research in Maine has shown little evidence of competitive relationships between the <b>bobcat</b> and coyote or red fox; separation distances and territory overlap appeared random among simultaneously monitored animals. However, other studies have found <b>bobcat</b> populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations, with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage. With the Canada lynx, however, the interspecific relationship affects distribution patterns; competitive exclusion by the <b>bobcat</b> {{is likely to have}} prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid relative.|$|E
5|$|Though the <b>bobcat</b> prefers {{rabbits and}} hares, it hunts insects, chickens, geese and other birds, small rodents, and deer. Prey {{selection}} depends on location and habitat, season, and abundance. Like most cats, the <b>bobcat</b> is territorial and largely solitary, although with some overlap in home ranges. It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries, including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces. The <b>bobcat</b> breeds from winter into spring {{and has a}} gestation period of about two months.|$|E
50|$|On July 22, 2010, {{he signed}} with the Charlotte <b>Bobcats.</b> On February 24, 2011, McGuire was waived by the <b>Bobcats</b> {{following}} a trade between the <b>Bobcats</b> and Portland Trail Blazers. However, he was re-signed on March 3, 2011.|$|R
50|$|The Quinnipiac <b>Bobcats</b> {{represent}} Quinnipiac University in ECAC Hockey. The <b>Bobcats</b> {{will attempt}} {{to qualify for the}} NCAA tournament {{for the first time in}} school history. The <b>Bobcats</b> will compete in the Nutmeg Classic on November 25 and 26.|$|R

5|$|<b>Bobcat</b> remains have {{occasionally}} {{been found}} in the resting sites of male fishers.|$|E
5|$|The adult <b>bobcat</b> has few predators {{other than}} humans, {{although}} it may be killed in interspecific conflict. Cougars and gray wolves can kill adult bobcats, a behavior repeatedly observed in Yellowstone National Park. Coyotes have killed adult bobcats and kittens. At least one confirmed observation of a <b>bobcat</b> and an American black bear (Ursus americanus) fighting over a carcass is confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bobcat</b> {{has long}} been valued both for fur and sport; it has been hunted and trapped by humans, but has {{maintained}} a high population, even in the southern United States, where it is extensively hunted. In the 1970s and 1980s, an unprecedented rise in price for <b>bobcat</b> fur caused further interest in hunting, but by the early 1990s, prices had dropped significantly. Regulated hunting still continues, with half of mortality of some populations being attributed to this cause. As a result, the rate of <b>bobcat</b> deaths is skewed in winter, when hunting season is generally open.|$|E
50|$|On March 21, 2014, {{he signed}} a 10-day {{contract}} with Charlotte <b>Bobcats.</b> On March 31, 2014, {{he signed a}} second 10-day contract with the <b>Bobcats.</b> On April 10, 2014, he signed with the <b>Bobcats</b> {{for the rest of}} the season.|$|R

50|$|The playoff dream {{may have}} not been {{realized}} had the <b>Bobcats</b> fallen in their season finale to rival Sam Houston State. Despite several Nealy turnovers, the <b>Bobcats</b> prevailed in overtime over the Bearkats in San Marcos. The <b>Bobcats</b> entered the playoffs as a fourth seed.|$|R
5|$|Urbanization {{can result}} in the {{fragmentation}} of contiguous natural landscapes into patchy habitat within an urban area. Animals that live in these fragmented areas often have reduced movement between the habitat patches, {{which can lead to}} reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Animals such as the <b>bobcat</b> are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home ranges. A study in coastal Southern California has shown <b>bobcat</b> populations are affected by urbanization, creation of roads, and other developments. The populations may not be declining as much as predicted, but instead the connectivity of different populations is affected. This leads to a decrease in natural genetic diversity among <b>bobcat</b> populations. For bobcats, preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary for population viability. Educating local residents about the animals is critical, as well, for conservation in urban areas.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bobcat</b> (Lynx rufus) is a North American {{cat that}} {{appeared}} during the Irvingtonian stage of around 1.8 million years ago (AEO). Containing 12 recognized subspecies, it ranges from southern Canada to central Mexico, including most of the contiguous United States. The <b>bobcat</b> is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas, as well as semidesert, urban edge, forest edge, and swampland environments. It remains in some of its original range, but populations are vulnerable to local extinction ("extirpation") by coyotes and domestic animals. With a gray to brown coat, whiskered face, and black-tufted ears, the <b>bobcat</b> resembles the other species of the midsized Lynx genus. It is smaller on average than the Canada lynx, with which it shares parts of its range, but is about {{twice as large as}} the domestic cat. It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped, stubby tail, from which it derives its name.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bobcat</b> is an {{adaptable}} animal. It prefers woodlands—deciduous, coniferous, or mixed—but {{unlike the}} other Lynx species, it does not depend exclusively on the deep forest. It ranges from the humid swamps of Florida to desert lands of Texas or rugged mountain areas. It makes its home near agricultural areas, if rocky ledges, swamps, or forested tracts are present; its spotted coat serves as camouflage. The population of the <b>bobcat</b> depends primarily on the population of its prey; other principal factors {{in the selection of}} habitat type include protection from severe weather, availability of resting and den sites, dense cover for hunting and escape, and freedom from disturbance.|$|E
50|$|In 2008 {{members of}} the Leeds American Football team youth squad were invited to Texas by the Celina <b>Bobcats,</b> who were the Division Three All Star State Champions, {{following}} tuition and guidance to form their own team back in England, the Leeds <b>Bobcats</b> were born. In 2010, the <b>Bobcats</b> Youth team won its first trophy after defeating the Colchester Gladiators in the final of a 5 team tournament. Several {{members of the}} <b>Bobcats</b> juniors went on to represent Great Britain at youth level and in 2011 {{the majority of the}} team progressed to senior level and the <b>Bobcats</b> became a Senior associate team.|$|R
5000|$|The Belleville <b>Bobcats</b> {{were first}} formed in 1972 {{as a member}} of the Metro Junior [...] "B" [...] league.In 1980 the team won the Metro Championship. With the {{founding}} of the OHL's Belleville Bulls, the <b>Bobcats</b> moved west to Trenton, and became the Trenton <b>Bobcats.</b> However, after uneven performance while in Trenton, the team returned to Belleville in 1987. After two seasons, the <b>Bobcats</b> moved to Wellington in 1989 and merged into the Wellington Dukes. The <b>Bobcats</b> were Metro [...] "B" [...] Champions and Sutherland Cup All-Ontario Junior [...] "B" [...] Champions in 1980. This team was owned and operated by Vern Nutley.|$|R
50|$|On April 15, 2012, Moon {{signed with}} the Charlotte <b>Bobcats.</b> On July 2, 2012, he was waived by the <b>Bobcats.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>bobcat</b> is {{believed}} to have evolved from the Eurasian lynx, which crossed into North America by way of the Bering Land Bridge during the Pleistocene, with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago. The first wave moved into the southern portion of North America, which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers. This population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago. A second population arrived from Asia and settled in the north, developing into the modern Canada lynx. Hybridization between the <b>bobcat</b> and the Canada lynx may sometimes occur.|$|E
5|$|The face appears wide due to ruffs of {{extended}} hair beneath the ears. <b>Bobcat</b> eyes are yellow with black pupils. The {{nose of the}} <b>bobcat</b> is pinkish-red, {{and it has a}} base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face, sides, and back. The pupils are round, black circles and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception. The cat has sharp hearing and vision, and a good sense of smell. It is an excellent climber, and swims when it needs to, but normally avoids water. However, cases of bobcats swimming long distances across lakes have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{range of}} the <b>bobcat</b> was from southern Canada, throughout the United States, and {{as far south as}} the Mexican state of Oaxaca, and it still persists across much of this area. In the 20th century, it was thought to have lost territory in the US Midwest and parts of the Northeast, including southern Minnesota, eastern South Dakota, and much of Missouri, mostly due to habitat changes from modern agricultural practices. While thought to no longer exist in western New York and Pennsylvania, multiple confirmed sightings of bobcats (including dead specimens) have been recently reported in New York's Southern Tier and in central New York. In addition, <b>bobcat</b> sightings have been confirmed in northern Indiana, and one was recently killed near Albion, Michigan. In early March, 2010, a <b>bobcat</b> was sighted (and later captured by animal control authorities) in a parking garage in downtown Houston. By 2010, bobcats appear to have recolonized many states, occurring in every state except Delaware.|$|E
5000|$|He {{worked for}} ESPN, {{although}} in April 2007, he interviewed for the vacant head coaching {{position with the}} Charlotte <b>Bobcats</b> (later known as the Charlotte Hornets) which was eventually filled by Sam Vincent. Upon the firing of Sam Vincent in April 2008, he stated that coaching the <b>Bobcats</b> would be a [...] "dream job." [...] On December 22, 2010, Silas was named interim {{head coach of the}} <b>Bobcats,</b> replacing the outgoing coach Larry Brown. On February 16, 2011, the <b>Bobcats</b> removed his interim status. On April 30, 2012, the <b>Bobcats</b> announced that Silas would not return to the <b>Bobcats</b> for the 2012 - 2013 season after producing the worst record in NBA history. Because of the record transfer that occurred in 2014, Silas's tenure with the <b>Bobcats</b> is now recognized as his second tenure with the Charlotte Hornets, meaning that he had coached them for about six seasons with a record of 204-220.|$|R

5|$|The {{species is}} {{considered}} endangered in Ohio, Indiana, and New Jersey. It {{was removed from}} the threatened list of Illinois in 1999 and of Iowa in 2003. In Pennsylvania, limited hunting and trapping are once again allowed, after having been banned from 1970 to 1999. The <b>bobcat</b> also suffered population decline in New Jersey {{at the turn of the}} 19th century, mainly because of commercial and agricultural developments causing habitat fragmentation; by 1972, the <b>bobcat</b> was given full legal protection, and was listed as endangered in the state in 1991. L. r. escuinipae, the subspecies found in Mexico, was for a time considered endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, but was delisted in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Habitats in Boise National Forest support nearly 300 {{terrestrial}} vertebrate {{species and}} 28 fish species. The most common large animals are mule deer and elk, but other mammals present include moose, black bears, cougar, coyote, yellow-bellied marmot, beaver, porcupine, Canadian lynx, mountain goat, pika, river otter, muskrat, pronghorn, mink, <b>bobcat,</b> marten, and timber wolves.|$|E
5|$|In some areas, coyotes {{share their}} ranges with bobcats. These two {{similarly}} sized species rarely physically confront one another, though <b>bobcat</b> populations tend to diminish {{in areas with}} high coyote densities. However, several studies have demonstrated interference competition between coyotes and bobcats, and in all cases coyotes dominated the interaction. Multiple researchers reported instances of coyotes killing bobcats, whereas bobcats killing coyotes is more rare. Coyotes attack bobcats using a bite-and-shake method similar to what is used on medium-sized prey. Coyotes (both single individuals and groups) {{have been known to}} occasionally kill bobcats – in most cases, the bobcats were relatively small specimens, such as adult females and juveniles. However, coyote attacks (by an unknown number of coyotes) on adult male bobcats have occurred. In California, coyote and <b>bobcat</b> populations are not negatively correlated across different habitat types, but predation by coyotes is an important source of mortality in bobcats. Biologist Stanley Paul Young noted that in his entire trapping career, he had never successfully saved a captured <b>bobcat</b> from being killed by coyotes, and wrote of two incidents wherein coyotes chased bobcats up trees. Coyotes have been documented to directly kill Canadian lynx on occasion, and compete with them for prey, especially snowshoe hares. In some areas, including central Alberta, lynx are more abundant where coyotes are few, thus interactions with coyotes appears to influence lynx populations more than the availability of snowshoe hares.|$|E

50|$|On July 28, 2009, he {{was traded}} to the Charlotte <b>Bobcats</b> in {{exchange}} for Emeka Okafor. Chandler joined a <b>Bobcats</b> team that had never made the playoffs in their young history. Chandler struggled with injuries in 2009-10, missing more than a month with a stress fracture in his left foot. Chandler still helped the <b>Bobcats</b> win 44 games and earn their first-ever postseason berth. The <b>Bobcats,</b> led by Gerald Wallace and Stephen Jackson, made it to the playoffs as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference, and went up against the Orlando Magic. Chandler had the task of defending Dwight Howard. Chandler limited Howard to 9 points and 9 rebounds per game, both below his season and career averages. The <b>Bobcats</b> were, however, swept in their first trip to the playoffs with their <b>Bobcats</b> moniker.|$|R
