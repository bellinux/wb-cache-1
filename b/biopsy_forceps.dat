40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the sensitivity of}} brush cytology and <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsy</b> in a homogeneous patient group with hilar cholangiocarcinoma. METHODS: Brush cytology and <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsy</b> were routinely performed in patients with suspected malignant biliary strictures. Fifty-eight consecutive patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) including <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsy</b> and brush cytology in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma between 1995 - 2005. RESULTS: Positive results for malignancy were obtained in 24 / 58 patients (41. 4 %) by brush cytology and in 31 / 58 patients (53. 4 %) by <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsy.</b> The combination of both techniques brush cytology and <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsy</b> resulted only in a minor increase in diagnostic sensitivity to 60. 3 % (35 / 58 patients). In 20 / 58 patients (34. 5 %), diagnosis were obtained by both positive cytology and positive histology, in 11 / 58 (19 %) by positive histology (negative cytology) and only 4 / 58 patients (6. 9 %) were confirmed by positive cytology (negative histology). CONCLUSION: Brush cytology and <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsy</b> have only limited sensitivity for the diagnosis of malignant hilar tumors.

50|$|Colon polyps are not {{commonly}} associated with symptoms. Occasionally rectal bleeding, and on rare occasions pain, diarrhea or constipation may occur because of colon polyps. Colon polyps are a concern {{because of the potential}} for colon cancer being present microscopically and the risk of benign colon polyps transforming over time into malignant ones. Since most polyps are asymptomatic, they are usually discovered at the time of colon cancer screening. Common screening methods are occult blood test, colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy (usually flexible sigmoidoscopy, using a flexible endoscope, but more rarely the older rigid sigmoidoscopy, using a rigid endoscope), lower gastrointestinal series (barium enema), digital rectal examination (DRE), and virtual colonoscopy. The polyps are routinely removed at the time of colonoscopy either with a polypectomy snare (first description by P. Deyhle, Germany, 1970) or with <b>biopsy</b> <b>forceps.</b> If an adenomatous polyp is found with sigmoidoscopy or if a polyp is found with any other diagnostic modality, the patient must undergo colonoscopy for removal of the polyp(s). Even though colon cancer is usually not found in polyps smaller than 2.5 cm, all polyps found are removed since the removal of polyps reduces the future likelihood of developing colon cancer. When adenomatous polyps are removed, a repeat colonoscopy is usually performed in three to five years.|$|E

It is common to combine <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsy</b> with cytology methods to increase the diagnostic yield. Although the flexible cryoprobe has been established for bronchoscopic interventions in malignant stenosis, the obtained biopsies, called “cryobiopsies,” have not been investigated in a large cohort of patients. The aim of this feasibility study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic yield and safety of cryobiopsy and <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsy.</b> MethodsDuring a 6 -year period, 296 patients with visible endoluminal tumor lesions {{were included in the}} study at the bronchoscopy unit of a university hospital. In the first consecutively conducted 55 cases, both techniques, <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsy</b> and cryobiopsy, were applied simultaneously. Pathologic and quantitative image analyses were performed to evaluate the size and quality of the obtained specimens. We evaluated the safety and diagnostic yield to describe the feasibility of cryobiopsy. ResultsComparative analysis of the first conducted and randomly assigned 55 cases revealed a significantly higher diagnostic yield for cryobiopsy compared with <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsy</b> (89. 1 % vs 65. 5 %, P <. 05). In this cohort, quantitative image analysis showed significantly larger biopsies regarding size and artifact-free tissue sections for cryobiopsy compared with <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsy</b> (P <. 0001). The overall diagnostic yield of cryobiopsy was 89. 5 %. Mild bleeding occurred in 11 cases (3. 7 %), moderate bleeding occurred in 3 cases (1. 0 %), and severe bleeding occurred in 1 case (0. 3 %).

40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of bronchoscopically recovered cryobiopsy of lung tissue {{has opened up}} new possibilities in the diagnosis of neoplastic and non-neoplastic lung diseases in various aspects. Most notably the morphological diagnosis of peripheral lung biopsies promises to achieve a better yield with a high quality of specimens. To better understand this phenomenon, its diagnostic options and perspectives, this study morphometrically compares 15 cryobiopsies and 18 transbronchial <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsies</b> of peripheral lung tissue a priori without considering clinical hit ratio or integration of results in the clinical diagnostic processing.

Urbanski" ABSTRACT: Electrocoagulation bronchoscopy <b>biopsy</b> <b>forceps</b> may prevent bleeding, but could also impair {{the quality of the}} specimens obtained. Patients with endobronchial lesions during bronchoscopy underwent six endobronchial biopsies each with a hot <b>biopsy</b> <b>forceps,</b> alternating between with electrocoagulation (‘‘hot’’) and without (‘‘cold’’). Bleeding was quantified on a scale of 1 – 4, with 1 being no bleeding. The generator was set on ‘‘soft coagulation’ ’ mode, with power settings of 40, 60, 80 and 100 W for each group of 10 patients in a sequential fashion. Clinical pathology results were recorded before samples were reviewed by a second, blinded, pulmonary pathologist. A total of 39 patients with 40 endobronchial lesions had six biopsies performed (one patient had only four samples taken), giving a total of 238 biopsy samples. Concordance between hot and cold samples was 92. 5 % for the clinical pathologist and 87 % for the blinded pathologist. Paired analysis suggested lower average bleeding score with the use of hot forceps. Overall bleeding rates for cold and hot biopsies, respectively, were as follows: grade 1 : 30. 3 and 41. 2 %; grade 2 : 62. 2 and 49. 6 %; grade 3 : 7. 6 and 9. 2 %; and grade 4 : 0 and 0 %. In conclusion, the use of hot <b>biopsy</b> <b>forceps</b> for endobronchial biopsy {{does not appear to have}} a negative impact on the pathological samples. Hot <b>biopsy</b> <b>forceps</b> showed a statistically significant reduction in bleeding score, which is unlikely to be of clinical significance...|$|E

The specimens were then submitted to a pathologist and processed. Histopathology of the obtained specimen confirmed the diagnostic suspicion of choroid melanoma in both patients. Conclusion. Essen <b>biopsy</b> <b>forceps</b> is a very practicable alternative method to the FNAB, allowing a combined histopathological and immunohistochemical examination for achieving high diagnostic accuracy at minimal risk. 1...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is growing}} {{advocacy}} {{for the use}} of disposable medical accessories to reduce the risks of infection transmission. Their purchase costs can, however, be considered as prohibitive in an endoscopy unit operating under a cost-containment program. We therefore compared the costs of reusable and disposable <b>biopsy</b> <b>forceps.</b> METHODS: From October 1995 to September 1997, biopsies were obtained in 7740 sessions. The evaluation of costs included purchase prices, repairs, cleaning (chemicals, equipment, technician time) and autoclaving costs in a centralized sterilization unit. For comparison, the lowest purchase price for disposable <b>biopsy</b> <b>forceps</b> was $ 26. 90 in 1997. RESULTS: A mean of 12 new reusable forceps were purchased every year for a total purchase price of $ 5460. A total of 315 biopsy sessions were performed per forceps (mean time life of 3 years per forceps, including 3 repairs). Yearly repair cost was $ 3308, equipment $ 1002, chemicals $ 3250, central sterilization $ 8333, and technician salary $ 4373. Total cost was $ 25, 726 and cost per biopsy session was $ 6. 65. CONCLUSIONS: Total purchase and reprocessing costs for reusable <b>biopsy</b> <b>forceps</b> were 25 % of those of disposable devices. The use of disposable <b>biopsy</b> <b>forceps</b> would have led to a yearly extra cost of $ 78, 377 in the operation of our endoscopy unit...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: Gastric {{dysplasia}} {{is generally}} accepted {{to be the}} precursor lesion of gastric carcinoma. Approxi-mately 25 % to 35 % of histological diagnoses based on endo-scopic forcep biopsies for gastric dysplastic lesions change following endoscopic resection (ER). The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the predictive endoscopic features of high-grade gastric dysplasia (HGD) or early gastric cancer (EGC) following ER for lesions initially diagnosed as low-grade dys-plasia (LGD) by a <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Methods: To determine pre-dictive variables for upgraded histology (LGD to HGD or EGC). The lesion size, gross endoscopic appearance, location, and surface nodularity or redness as well as the presence of a depressed portion, Helicobacter pylori infection, and intes-tinal metaplasia were retrospectively investigated. Results: Among 251 LGDs diagnosed by an initial <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsy,</b> th...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Fiberoptic {{bronchoscopy}} (FOB) {{has been}} one of the essential procedures used in the diagnosis of lung cancer. Diagnostic yields of FOB related procedures such as bronchial washing (BW), bronchial brush-ing (BB), bronchial biopsy (BBx), and transbronchial biopsy (TBBx) depend on the location and extent of the tumors. The yields of BW vary among different studies (39 - 79 %). Some reported that the yield might increase in post-bronchoscopic sputum. Since samples from BW are obtained directly from the respiratory tract, we hypothesized that post bronchoscopic <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsy</b> BW might further increase the yield as well. The objec-tive of this study was to compare the diagnostic yields of bronchial washing before and after <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsy</b> for lung cancer. Material and Method: 114 patients, 70 with endobronchial lesions (42 exophytic lesions, 28 submucosal lesions) and 44 with non-endobronchial lesions, suspected to have lung cancers were evaluated at Siriraj Hospital between March and October 2000. All the patients underwent FOB with initial BW then <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsy</b> (BBx or TBBx) of the lesions followed by re-BW. The cytological specimens were blinded to the cytopathologists. Positive cytologic results of each procedural specimen were compared to final malignancy diagnosis (by positive specimens from FOB, transthoracic needle aspiration, surgery, clinical and radiologi-cal follow-up) to determine the sensitivity of each test...|$|R
40|$|Endoscopic <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsy</b> is {{essential}} before planning an endoscopic resection of upper gastrointestinal epithelial tumors. However, for-ceps biopsy {{is limited by}} its superficiality and frequency of sampling errors. Histologic discrepancies between endoscopic forceps biop-sies and resected specimens are frequent. Factors associated with such histologic discrepancies are tumor size, macroscopic type, surface color, {{and the type of}} medical facility. Precise targeting of biopsies is recommended to achieve an accurate diagnosis, curative endoscopic resection, and a satisfactory oncologic outcome. Multiple deep <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsies</b> can induce mucosal ulceration in early gastric cancer. Endoscopic resection for early gastric cancer with ulcerative findings is associated with piecemeal resection, incomplete resection, and a risk for procedure-related complications such as bleeding and perforation. Such active ulcers caused by <b>forceps</b> <b>biopsy</b> and following submucosal fibrosis might also be mistaken as an indication for more aggressive procedures, such as gastrectomy with D 2 lymph node dissection. Proton pump inhibitors might be prescribed to facilitate the healing of biopsy-induced ulcers if an active ulcer is predicted after deep biopsy. It is unknown which time interval from biopsy to endoscopic resection is appropriate for a safe procedure and a good oncologic outcome. Further investigations are needed to conclude the appropriate time interval...|$|R
