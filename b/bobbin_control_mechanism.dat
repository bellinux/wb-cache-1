30|$|Congestion {{control is}} {{fundamental}} to network operations and is responsible for throttling the number of packets entering the network.

TCP congestion <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> operate in the end-systems of the network to limit the packet sending rate when congestion is detected. Another well-known congestion <b>control</b> <b>mechanism</b> is queue management [72] that operates inside the intermediate nodes of the network (e.g. switches and routers) to complement TCP. There have been several improvements in congestion <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for the Internet and evolutionary network architectures, such as Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTN) and Named Data Networking (NDN).
