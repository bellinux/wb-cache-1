5|$|In the original, 7th-century charter {{recording}} this grant, Reculver {{is referred}} to as a civitas, or city, but this is probably a reference to either its Roman past or the church's monastic status, rather than a large population centre. In 692 Reculver's abbot Berhtwald was elected Archbishop of Canterbury, from which position he probably offered Reculver patronage and support. Bede, writing no more than 40 years later, described Berhtwald as having been well educated in the Bible and experienced in ecclesiastical and monastic affairs, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> indicating that Berhtwald was not a scholar.|$|E
5|$|The {{enormous}} task which Gaudí faced, not {{in terms}} of the number of works, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of their complexity, required the collaboration of a large number of assistants, artists, architects and craftsmen. Gaudí always led the way, but allowed expression of the individual abilities of all of his collaborators. A test of his expertise both in his field and in interpersonal communication was demonstrated in bringing together a large number of diverse professionals and creating an integrated team.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Buckley {{wrote that}} by 1 July, {{there was a}} {{stalemate}} in which the British were established south of the Odon but had retired from Hill 112, in {{what may have been}} a premature decision. The Germans had maintained a continuous front but only by using reserves which made it impossible to begin the counter-offensive planned by , which made the offensive a considerable Allied success, as part of a strategy of attrition based on organised fire power. Looked on as an attempt to break through and force the Germans out of Caen the operation failed <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of Montgomery's strategy it was a costly victory. The German defence of Normandy never recovered from the damage inflicted during Epsom, the initiative was lost and German counter-attack tactics failed in the face of Allied fire power, with even greater cost than that inflicted on the British; the German command structure and assumptions on which the defence was based were undermined.|$|E

25|$|The Rydberg formula, {{which was}} known empirically before Bohr's formula, {{is seen in}} Bohr's theory as {{describing}} the energies of transitions or quantum jumps between one orbital energy levels.

Lacan retains Freud's dualism <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of an opposition between the symbolic and the imaginary and not referred to different kinds of drives. For Lacan all drives are sexual drives, and every drive is a death drive (pulsion de mort) since every drive is excessive, repetitive and destructive.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{traditional}} personality tests that contain subscales relating to psychopathy, though they assess relatively non-specific tendencies towards antisocial or criminal behavior. These include the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (Psychopathic Deviate scale), California Psychological Inventory (Socialization scale), and Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory Antisocial Personality Disorder scale. There {{is also the}} Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRP) and the Hare Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (HSRP), <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of self-report tests, the PPI/PPI-R has become more used than either of these in modern psychopathy research on adults.|$|E

50|$|There {{are often}} other cost metrics in {{addition}} to execution time {{that are relevant to}} compare query plans https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ9FHvOJ0Ws. In a cloud computing scenario for instance, one should compare query plans not only <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of how much time they take to execute <b>but</b> also <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of how much money their execution costs. Or in the context of approximate query optimization, it is possible to execute query plans on randomly selected samples of the input data in order to obtain approximate results with reduced execution overhead. In such cases, alternative query plans must be compared <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of their execution time <b>but</b> also <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of the precision or reliability of the data they generate.|$|R

There is a large number of performance criteria, but there are no baseline data and no methodology for monitoring. There may even be a disincentive for provinces to improve their monitoring systems, since it is in their interest to show that their access figures are low and that they are in need of more central funds.|$|E
