2500|$|March 5, 2010 a rebroadcast of Powers' This I Believe {{episode was}} aired on The <b>Bob</b> <b>Edwards</b> Show. The event was marked in Bakersfield. The show remains {{available}} on Audible.com and iTunes. In the presentation the commentators reviewed his forward thinking efforts {{and the wide}} scale of his reading across religions and they were struck by his pursuit of knowledge from an awareness of Lawrence of Arabia to actually reading the Qur'an, the way the Bahá'í quote [...] "The earth is but one country and mankind its citizens" [...] was emphasized {{in his life and}} was found when there were so few Bahá'ís around, and the way the New Testament inspired him to [...] "put down his gun".|$|E

5000|$|The phrase [...] "In the catbird seat" [...] {{was among}} the {{numerous}} folksy expressions used by Barber. According to Barber's daughter, after her father read Thurber's story, he began using the phrase [...] "in the catbird seat." [...] This seems to reverse events, however, as the passage of story quoted above clearly references Barber himself. According to [...] "Colonel" [...] <b>Bob</b> <b>Edwards's</b> book Fridays with Red, Barber claimed that Thurber got this and many other expressions from him, and that Barber had first heard the term used during a poker game in Cincinnati during the Great Depression. Barber himself also put forth this version of events in his 1968 autobiography, Rhubarb in the Catbird Seat.|$|R
2500|$|After a {{time at the}} Lenin Barracks in Barcelona he {{was sent}} to the {{relatively}} quiet Aragon Front under Georges Kopp. By January 1937 he was at Alcubierre [...] above sea level, in the depth of winter. There was very little military action, and Orwell was shocked by the lack of munitions, food, and firewood, and other extreme deprivations. Orwell, with his Cadet Corps and police training, was quickly made a corporal. On the arrival of a British ILP Contingent about three weeks later, Orwell and the other English militiaman, Williams, were sent with them to Monte Oscuro. The newly arrived ILP contingent included Bob Smillie, <b>Bob</b> <b>Edwards,</b> Stafford Cottman and Jack Branthwaite. The unit was then sent on to Huesca.|$|E
2500|$|The announcing crew for {{the game}} {{consisted}} of a five-person team with only one video camera. Jonathan Wiener, a Trinity sophomore English major from Jackson, Mississippi, had the play-by-play. Justin Thompson, (brother of Shawn Thompson, one of the play participants) of New Braunfels, Texas, was the color analyst. Bill Swint of New Braunfels, Texas, ran the video camera assisted by Butch Maddux of China Spring, Texas. The video and audio feeds were mixed and uploaded live to a streaming videocast server by <b>Bob</b> <b>Edwards</b> of Dallas, Texas. The game was broadcast live on the internet but was not otherwise televised. According to The New York Times, [...] "Wiener kept his cool through the frenzy and described most of the details precisely as they occurred. The replay of the video with Wiener’s description has been shown on national television {{and has become a}} hit on the Internet." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the <b>Bob</b> <b>Edwards</b> Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E
