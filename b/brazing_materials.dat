40|$|Recently {{there has}} {{been a great deal of}} {{interest}} in research development and commercialization of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Joining and sealing are critical issues that will need to be addressed before SOFCs can truly perform as expected. Ceramics and metals can be difficult to join together, especially when the joint must withstand up to 900 C operating temperature of the SOFCs.

40|$|Ceramics {{are being}} used {{increasingly}} in applications where high temperatures are encountered such as automobile and gas turbine engines. However, the use of ceramics is limited {{by a lack of}} methods capable of producing strong, high temperature joints. This is because most ceramic-ceramic joining techniques, such as brazing, require that the entire assembly be exposed to high temperatures in order to assure that the <b>braze</b> <b>material</b> melts. Alternatively, localized heating using high energy electron beams may be used to selectively heat the <b>braze</b> <b>material.</b> In this work, high energy electron beam brazing of a ceramic part is modeled numerically. The part considered consists of a ceramic cylinder and disk between which is sandwiched an annular washer of <b>braze</b> <b>material.</b> An electron beam impinges on the disk, melting the braze metal.

40|$|A simple tube-plate joint {{tensile test}} was {{implemented}} {{to compare the}} effectiveness of commercial brazes, namely, TiCuNi, TiCuSil, and Cu-ABA, used for bonding Ti-tubes joined to C-C composite plates.

40|$|SUMMARY The use of {{orthodontic}} appliances {{may contribute to}} local gingivitis, often attributed to increased plaque retention. Gingivitis of bacterial origin cannot clinically be distinguished from local tissue irritation caused by corrosion products. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to assess the cytotoxic effect of various metallic components used in orthodontics. Multi-component devices such as facebows, molar bands, and brackets along with single-component brackets and archwires were tested by the agar overlay cytotoxicity test with mouse fibroblast cells. None of the archwires caused any cytotoxic effect, even though some contained 54 per cent nickel. However, the multi-component devices, which were joined with silver- and copper-based brazing alloys were more cytotoxic than the single-component devices. Copper is more cytotoxic than nickel, which could explain the greater cytotoxic effect of the samples with <b>brazing</b> <b>materials.</b> It is speculated that cytotoxic corrosion products from {{orthodontic appliances}} might contribute to localized gingivitis...|$|E

In particular, metal supported SOFCs consisting of metallic frames and substrates coated with plasma sprayed functional layers have shown an excellent stability concerning redox cycling. In order to provide sufficient power, these single cells have to be assembled to stacks. To prevent short-circuiting the frame of each cell has to be electrically insulated from the neighbouring one. For that purpose a ceramic coating is applied on each metal frame by thermal spraying before it is brazed to other stack components. Such layers should at one hand show good wetting and adhesion to the silver based <b>brazing</b> <b>materials.</b> On the other hand it should maintain sufficient electrical resistance even at the fuel cell operating temperature.

In this study, the effects of microstructural changes on the property of clad sheets due to thermomechanical treatment were investigated. The clad sheets were fabricated by roll bonding of twin-roll-cast AA 3527 and AA 4343 alloys followed by cold rolling down to a thickness of 0. 22 mm.

40|$|Key words:brazing, alloys, powderprecursors, coated rods Abstract. The paper {{presents}} research made {{to achieve}} environmental powder precursors from a CuSnP alloy, {{used in the}} manufacturing process of <b>brazing</b> <b>materials,</b> such as coated rods. The innovation of the paper consists in the elemental participation of the components in the new alloys, procedure {{that takes place in}} the alloying process, throughcoat conditions of the addition materials and by simultaneous obtaining the new precursors that fulfill high friability and deoxidation conditions {{of the participants in the}} brazing process. Developing the copper alloy batches is conditioned by a good protection to oxidation and gas absorption from the melting oven atmosphere. In order to protect the melt from the above mentioned phenomena’s we developed a slagging flux, boron-cryolithe type, which has melting proprieties below those of the copper phosphorus alloy, approx. 700 °C. The load calculation was made based on the technical characteristics of the industrial base materials that were used, taking into account the loss coefficient of 5 %. The melting, casting and cooling of the samples, dimensioned so they will be friable, was accomplished through classic procedures. The grinding of the sample, including the moistening thermic treatments, was achieved by experimental research, followed by calculations, based on the criteria of maximum yield for grinding. Estimating the sample friability,in the preliminary phase of the experimental determinations, was needed in order to restrain the testing domain,through structural and hardness analyses.

40|$|Nickel {{titanium}} (NiTi) {{plate of}} 1. 2 mm thickness was successfully clad on AISI 316 L {{stainless steel substrate}} by a microwave-assisted brazing process. Brazing was conducted in a multimode microwave oven in air using a copper-based <b>brazing</b> <b>material</b> in tape form. The <b>brazing</b> <b>material</b> was melted {{in a few minutes}} by microwave-induced plasma initiated by conducting wires surrounding the brazing assembly. Metallographic study by scanning-electron microscopy (SEM) and compositional analysis by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) of the brazed joint revealed metallurgical bonding formed via inter-diffusion between the brazing filler and the adjacent materials. A shear bonding strength in the range of 100 - 150 MPa was recorded in shear tests of the brazed joint. SEM and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) analysis for the surface of as-received NiTi plate and NiTi cladding showed similar microstructure and phase composition. Nanoindentation tests also indicated that the superelastic properties of NiTi were essentially retained. The cavitation erosion resistance of the NiTi cladding was essentially {{the same as that of}} as-received NiTi plate, and higher than that obtained in laser or TIG (tungsten-inert gas) surfacing. The high resistance could be attributed to avoidance of dilution and defect formation in the NiTi clad since the cladding did not undergo melting and solidification in the brazing process. Electrochemical tests also recorded similar corrosion resistance in both as-received NiTi and NiTi cladding. Thus, the present study indicates that microwave-assisted brazing is a simple, economical, and feasible process for cladding NiTi on 316 L stainless steel for enhancing cavitation erosion resistance. © 2005 Elsevier B.
