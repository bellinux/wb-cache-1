5|$|Beryllium {{improves}} many {{physical properties}} when added as an alloying element to aluminium, copper (notably the alloy <b>beryllium</b> <b>copper),</b> iron and nickel. Beryllium does not form oxides {{until it reaches}} very high temperatures. Tools made of <b>beryllium</b> <b>copper</b> alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In structural applications, the combination of high flexural rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays {{and other forms of}} ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of particle detectors. The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and beryllium oxide have led to their use in thermal management applications.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{products}} {{are the leading}} manufacturing field. The United States is the largest producer {{of oil in the}} world, as well as its second-largest importer. It is the world's number one producer of electrical and nuclear energy, as well as liquid natural gas, sulfur, phosphates, and salt. The National Mining Association provides data pertaining to coal and minerals that include <b>beryllium,</b> <b>copper,</b> lead, magnesium, zinc, titanium and others.|$|E
5|$|Mixing about 2.0% {{beryllium}} into copper {{forms an}} alloy called <b>beryllium</b> <b>copper</b> that is six times stronger than copper alone. Beryllium alloys {{are used in}} many applications because of their combination of elasticity, high electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, high strength and hardness, nonmagnetic properties, as well as good corrosion and fatigue resistance. These applications include non-sparking tools that are used near flammable gases (beryllium nickel), in springs and membranes (beryllium nickel and beryllium iron) used in surgical instruments and high temperature devices. As little as 50 parts per million of beryllium alloyed with liquid magnesium leads to {{a significant increase in}} oxidation resistance and decrease in flammability.|$|E

5|$|Since moulds {{have been}} {{expensive}} to manufacture, they were usually only used in mass production {{where thousands of}} parts were being produced. Typical moulds are constructed from hardened steel, pre-hardened steel, aluminium, and/or beryllium-copper alloy. The choice of material to build a mould from is primarily one of economics; in general, steel moulds cost more to construct, but their longer lifespan will offset the higher initial cost over a higher number of parts made before wearing out. Pre-hardened steel moulds are less wear-resistant and are used for lower volume requirements or larger components; their typical steel hardness is 38–45 on the Rockwell-C scale. Hardened steel moulds are heat treated after machining; these are by far superior in terms of wear resistance and lifespan. Typical hardness ranges between 50 and 60 Rockwell-C (HRC). Aluminium moulds can cost substantially less, and when designed and machined with modern computerised equipment can be economical for moulding tens or even {{hundreds of thousands of}} parts. <b>Beryllium</b> <b>copper</b> is used in areas of the mould that require fast heat removal or areas that see the most shear heat generated. The moulds can be manufactured either by CNC machining or by using electrical discharge machining processes.|$|E
25|$|The {{starting}} material is a flat substrate, {{such as a}} silicon wafer or a polished disc of <b>beryllium,</b> <b>copper,</b> titanium, or other material.

25|$|Most keys have needle springs made of {{phosphor}} bronze, stainless steel, <b>beryllium</b> <b>copper,</b> or a gold alloy. The B thumb keys {{typically have}} flat springs. Phosphor bronze {{is by far}} the most common material for needle springs because it is relatively inexpensive, makes a good spring, and is resistant to corrosion. Unfortunately, it is prone to metal fatigue. Stainless steel also makes a good spring and is resistant to corrosion. Gold springs are found mostly in high-end flutes because of gold's cost.|$|E

The chlorine dioxide process, which originated in Germany after World War I, is becoming more popular because of environmental pressures to reduce or eliminate chlorinated bleaching compounds.
