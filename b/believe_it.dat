5|$|I {{believe in}} all sincerity {{that if you}} do not deflate the {{opposition}} candidate before your own campaign gets started, the odds are you are doomed to defeat.

5|$|Laurens Hammond died in 1973, and {{the company}} {{struggled}} to survive, proposing an acquiring of Roland in 1972, which was turned down.

5|$|The Persians were {{alerted to}} the {{withdrawal}} of the Greeks by a boat from Histiaea, but did not at first <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> They sent some ships to see if this was the case, and finding that it was, the whole fleet set sail for Artemisium in the morning. The Persians then sailed on to Histiaea and sacked the surrounding region.|$|E

5|$|The Quran is {{the central}} {{religious}} text of Islam. Muslims <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> represents the words of God revealed by the archangel Gabriel to Muhammad.

Palaeontologists <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> would have eaten plants such as mosses, ferns, horsetails, cycads, and conifers or fruits.

5|$|After {{the split}} with the Bahá'ís, some Azalis were {{very active in}} secular reform {{movements}} and the Iranian Constitutional Revolution (19051907), including Shaykh Ahmad Ruhi Kermani and Mirza Abd-al-Hosayn Kermani. However, the community was still suppressed as a heresy and the accusation of being an Azali was often enough for most to <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> to be true.

5|$|Although {{the story}} of the Tree That Owns Itself is more legend than history, the tree has become (along with the University Arch and the Double-Barreled Cannon) one of the most {{recognized}} and well-loved symbols of Athens.

5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is reasonable to conclude that the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E
5|$|But how, {{it may be}} asked, can any {{analogous}} principle {{apply in}} nature?

5|$|Charles's wife, Isabeau of Bavaria, {{held the}} ball to honor the {{remarriage}} of a lady-in-waiting. Scholars <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> was a traditional charivari, with the dancers disguised as wild men, mythical beings often associated with demonology, that were commonly represented in medieval Europe and documented in revels of Tudor England. The event was chronicled by contemporary writers such as the Monk of St Denis and Jean Froissart, and illustrated {{in a number of}} 15th-century illuminated manuscripts by painters such as the Master of Anthony of Burgundy. The incident later provided inspiration for Edgar Allan Poe's short story Hop-Frog.|$|E
5|$|Gigantic and {{visually}} impressive, the Megalosaurus {{became one of}} the park's three 'mascot dinosaurs' along with the Iguanodon and (less so) the Ichthyosaurs. Working from fragmentary evidence from Jurassic fossils found in England, consisting mainly of a hip and femur (thigh bone), with a rib and a few vertebrae, Owen conjectured the animal was quadrupedal; palaeontologists now <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> to have been bipedal (standing like Tyrannosaurus rex). The first suggestion that some dinosaurs might have been bipedal came in 1858, just too late to influence the model.|$|E
