40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this thesis}} is the {{knowledge}} of the most relevant deactivation mechanisms of Pd/Rh three-way catalysts under different ageing conditions, the deactivation correlation of laboratory scale ageing and engine bench/vehicle ageings, and the evaluation of the deactivation correlation. In the literature review, the phenomena involved in the three-way catalyst operation and its deactivation are considered. In the experimental section, ageing-induced phenomena in the catalyst are studied and deactivation correlations between laboratory scale and engine bench/vehicle ageings are presented, {{based on the results of}} several surface characterization techniques. The effects of ageing atmosphere and temperature, and time are considered in particular. Fresh and aged catalysts used in this study were metallic monoliths designed for Euro IV emission limits. Thermal ageings were carried out in the reductive, oxidative and inert atmospheres in the temperature range of 800 °C to 1200 °C, and in the presence of water vapour (hydrothermal ageing). The engine ageing was carried out in the exhaust gas stream of a V 8 engine during a 40 hour period. The ageing procedure composed of rich and stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratios carried out consecutively. The vehicle ageing was accomplished under real driving conditions (100 000 kilometres). According to the results, deactivation of a Pd/Rh monolith is a combination of several ageing phenomena. The most important deactivation mechanisms are the sintering of active phase, the collapse in surface area and ageing-induced solid-solid phase transitions in the bulk washcoat. Furthermore, poisoning is a relevant deactivation mechanism of the vehicle-aged catalyst. High ageing temperature, gas phase composition and exposure time are essential variables to the deactivation of a Pd/Rh three-way catalyst. This thesis presents an approach to discover the deactivation correlation between the laboratory scale ageing and under the vehicle's operation in an engine bench or on-road. Based on the characterization results, the accelerated laboratory scale air ageing does not correspond to the ageing-induced changes in the catalyst under the vehicle's operation. Therefore, there is a need for a modified ageing cycle and according to the results, a deactivation correlation between the laboratory scale ageing and the engine <b>bench</b> <b>ageing</b> can be presented as a function of ageing temperature and atmosphere, and time. Instead, after the vehicle operation, the deactivation correlation cannot be presented based solely on the studied variables because, after 100 000 kilometres of driving, the role of poisoning should be taken into account in the ageing cycle. The results of this thesis can be utilized and applied in the development of laboratory scale ageing cycles, which corresponds closely to the ageing-induced changes in the catalyst during the vehicle operation. This enables a rather fast testing of the catalyst's performance and reduces the cost during the manufacturing of catalysts...|$|E

40|$|International audienceReliability is the {{key issue}} {{concerning}} ultracapacitor applications. In several power applications ultracapacitors are charged and discharged at high current which causes ultracapacitors heating. This paper presents ultracapacitor ageing according to the temperature. To investigate this effect, a test <b>bench</b> of accelerated <b>ageing</b> of ultracapacitor is carried out. Experimental tests are realized at constant temperature when the ultracapacitors are polarized at the maximum voltage. To quantify the ultracapacitor ageing, the equivalent series resistance (ESR) and the equivalent capacitance (Cequi) are measured using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The cause of this ageing is the degradation of the electrolyte and the activated carbon. The electrolyte decomposes during the oxydoreduction phenomena which creates by-products. This degradation leads to an increase of the Equivalent Series Resistance. These by-products deteriorate also {{the surface of the}} activated carbon which generates the reduction in the capacitance. After these tests, the ultracapacitor lifetime is obtained versus temperature for the fixed voltage. With the use of the law of Arrhenius the ultracapacitor lifetime is generalized at all the temperatures but always for an extreme voltage which is the nominal voltage of the component. Finally, other tests on various ultracapacitors are made to generalize the lifetime of the ultracapacitor according to the temperature...|$|R
40|$|Exposure dating of last-glacial cycle {{deposits}} in Tasmania, New Zealand and Patagonia reveal a {{temporal and spatial}} variability of glacial advances different to that apparent in the Northern Hemisphere. Exposure ages from six alpine valley systems in Tasmania and three in New Zealand reveal similar trends: (1) MIS- 3 (~ 30 - 40 ka) advances are of limited extent in Tasmania and less extensive than New Zealand MIS- 2 advances; (2) peak glacial cold conditions (‘LGM’) occur between ~ 24 - 29 ka; (3) amelioration of LGM conditions and glacial retreat commenced ~ 19 - 22 ka; (4) deglaciation inferred from recessional moraine sequences continued to 14 - 15 ka; (5) {{there is little evidence}} for a major late glacial readvance younger than 14 - 15 ka with lower valley regions devoid of ice. This moraine chronology suggests that following a ‘weak’ MIS 3 cool phase, the Southern Hemisphere, or ‘local’ LGM, peaked and was followed by warming a few thousand years prior to that apparent in the Northern Hemisphere. These moraine ages from New Zealand and Tasmania for the LGM–LGIT (ca. 30 to 11 ka) show a remarkable similarity to the glacial chronology emerging from Lagos Buenos Aires in Patagonia. A near-complete record of glacial expansion phases over the last glacial cycle is preserved in the series of 10 glacial moraine benches (8 of which have been exposure dated) that flank the slopes of Mt Murchison above Lake Te Anau, Fiordland, New Zealand. Five other glacial advance phases are recorded as distinct <b>benches</b> with <b>ages</b> decreasing with altitude from LGM peak (27. 2 ka, 830 m a. s. l.), recessional phases (24. 4, 19. 9, 20. 7 and 17. 2 ka) with the youngest terrace just above the lake (15. 8 ka, 220 m a. s. l.). This deglaciation chronology correlates well with δ 18 O variability apparent in the ice core records from Byrd and Law Dome in Antarctica, each of which display most depleted δ 18 O values from 30 to 20 ka, followed by general warming to 10 ka. Hence, the general character of Antarctic climate variability as observed in δ 18 O trends from the ice cores appear to be reflected in the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude terrestrial deglaciation chronologies determined by cosmogenic exposure dating.

40|$|The {{determination}} of oak wood {{contribution to the}} Canadian whisky ageing process was studied. A direct injection – gas chromatography mass spectrometry method was developed and optimized to accurately monitor thermally degraded wood extracts derived from hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin. Thermally degraded wood extracts included furfural, 5 -methylfurfural, furfuryl alcohol, cyclotene, guaiacol, cis-whisky lactone, creosol, trans-whisky lactone, maltol, 4 -ethylguaiacol, eugenol, 4 -ethylphenol, syringol, 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural, vanillin, and syringaldehyde. A three year ageing process of base Canadian whisky in brand new casks with 2 mm and 4 mm depth char, once used American Bourbon casks, and refurbished rechar casks were monitored over time for the thermally degraded wood extracts and compared. New casks had 80000 ppb of extract/LAA (litres of absolute alcohol), once-used AB casks had 20000 ppb of extract/LAA, and refurbished – rechar casks had 18000 ppb of extract/LAA {{at the end of}} the three year period. Extractions of wood compounds were logarithmic profiles. The time taken to extract half the total wood components of the three year ageing process was 30 - 50 days. To predict the ageing process in Canadian whisky the chemical structure of oak wood staves were determined using various alkaline and acid gravimetric digestions, and the results were calibrated with a fibre optic accessory from an NIR. The calibration models developed were neutral detergent solubles (RMSECV = 2. 65), hemicellulose (RMSECV = 2. 13), lignin (RMSECV = 2. 42), cellulose (RMSECV = 7. 22), and char (RMSECV = 7. 07). The models developed were adequate for screening purposes with RPD values of 1. 53 – 3. 74. A 60 day disc <b>ageing</b> study for <b>bench</b> top <b>ageing</b> experiments was developed to correlate the compound changes over time and the wood derived extracts in the surrounding spirit. It was determined that hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin derived compounds extract at different rates, and the error of the developed calibration models was too great in order to correlate loss in hemicellulose, lignin, and cellulose to the amount of wood extract that entered the whisky. The 60 day disc protocol was used to directly calibrate total wood extract in the spirit to the NIR probe. It was determined that NIR could be successfully used to predict the thermally degraded wood extract available on the surface layer below the char on a bench top level. The calibration model had a RMSECV of 914 ppb, R 2 of 0. 94, RPD of 3. 98, and a RER of 32. 53...|$|R

In the past, many judges have availed themselves of this privilege. Some, however, have remained upon the bench long beyond the time that they are able to adequately discharge their duties, and in consequence the administration of justice has suffered.I suggest an act providing that when any judge of a federal court below the Supreme Court fails to avail himself of the privilege of retiring now granted by law, that the President be required, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint another judge, who would preside over the affairs of the court and have precedence over the older one. This will insure at all times the presence of a judge sufficiently active to discharge promptly and adequately the duties of the court. The content of McReynolds's proposal and the bill later submitted by Roosevelt were so similar to each other that it is thought the most probable source of the idea. Roosevelt and Cummings also relished the opportunity to hoist McReynolds by his own petard. McReynolds, having been born in 1862, had been in his early fifties when he wrote his 1914 proposal, but was well over seventy when Roosevelt's plan was set forth.|$|R
