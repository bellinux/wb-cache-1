5|$|In 1993 Christensen was arrested, tried, {{and sentenced}} to five years, four months {{imprisonment}} for trafficking marijuana and heroin. She claimed that she had <b>been</b> <b>driving</b> a car from Texas to Florida {{as a favor to}} friends, and had no knowledge that she was being used as a drug mule by them. Many Odinists and Asastruer decried the sentence, and claimed that it was a political frame-up; Murray established a Free Else Christensen Committee and with Stephen McNallen created a defense fund to aid her. Christensen herself did not endorse the claim that the charges were politically motivated, instead blaming her own naivete at being exploited by drug dealers. Before being imprisoned she gave the Odinist Fellowship's membership list to McNallen for the use of his own Heathen organisation, the Asatru Folk Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Timoshenko and his partner, Officer Herman Yan, had <b>been</b> <b>driving</b> in {{a marked}} 71st precinct police {{car on a}} routine patrol in Crown Heights, with Timoshenko riding as the {{passenger}} when they spotted a 2003 black BMW sports utility vehicle headed westbound on Lefferts Avenue at 2:30 am. The officers scanned the BMW's license plate on a computer in their police car. When the check came back, it indicated that the plate was assigned to a 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander, not the BMW. Timoshenko and Yan signaled for the vehicle to pull over, and the driver complied, turning north onto Rogers Avenue, where both officers got out of their car and approached the stopped vehicle.|$|E

25|$|A Chevrolet lorry was {{purchased}} in 1933 for a {{collection and delivery}} service at Staple, especially for the fruit and vegetable farmers. This was apparently a success, but the service seems to have ceased {{in the early part of}} the Second World War.

25|$|In February 2016, Uber's vetting {{procedures}} {{came under}} scrutiny once more following the 2016 Kalamazoo shootings, purportedly committed by Jason Dalton, an Uber driver in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

This led to a seven-hour manhunt for the suspect, during which it is believed that Dalton continued to drive and accept fares. Uber was aware of the issues with Dalton's driving skills, having received multiple complaints, though critics agree that Dalton would not have raised any red flags since {{he did not have a}} criminal record.|$|E

25|$|A highly {{successful}} motor racing driver in many disciplines, Dan Gurney had <b>been</b> <b>driving</b> in Formula One {{since the late}} 1950s. While driving for the Brabham works team, he joined {{with a group of}} prominent motor racing figures and financial backers in the United States, including Carroll Shelby, to found All American Racers. This effort was largely backed by the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, in an effort to challenge Firestone's longtime dominance of American open-wheel racing. Inspired by the performance of Jack Brabham and Bruce McLaren's own teams, AAR decided to enter Grand Prix racing. Then as now, the main engineering hub for Formula One manufacturers was in the United Kingdom, so AAR set up a subsidiary team known as Anglo American Racers which, while registered and based in the USA, was named in deference to the cars' British Weslake engines.|$|E

25|$|The team ran the 1987 HDT VL {{during the}} 1988 Australian Touring Car Championship while the {{evolution}} car was homologated {{and prepared for}} later in the season. In the 1988 ATCC, the Commodore's were really just making up the numbers against the Ford Sierra RS500's and the best Perkins could manage was a 3rd at Sandown (during the season, Perkins had actually been testing {{one of the new}} fuel injected Commodore's and became increasingly frustrated at the delays in debuting the car). Jeff Allam and Armin Hahne, both with long associations with TWR, joined the team for the Sandown 500, with Perkins and Hulme sharing a brand new Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV while Allam and Hahne drove Perkins old VL updated to TWR specs. Hahne, who in 1988 had <b>been</b> <b>driving</b> a Ford Sierra for Walter Wolf Racing in the European Touring Car Championship and the German DTM series, was a late replacement for Tom Walkinshaw, who was unable to drive as scheduled due to the death of his father. Perkins and Hulme had a strong race at Sandown, finishing second behind the Sierra of Allan Moffat and Gregg Hansford, while the Allam/Hulme car failed to finish.|$|E
