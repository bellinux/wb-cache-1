500|$|<b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> {{would not}} be misunderstood. By the love of our country, I do not mean loyalty to our King, for that is a duty of another nature, and a man may be very loyal, in the common sense of the word, without one grain of public good in his heart. Witness this very kingdom we live in. I verily believe, that since the {{beginning}} of the world, no nation upon earth ever shewed (all circumstances considered), such high constant marks of loyalty in all their action and behaviour as we have done; and at the same time, no people ever appeared more utterly void of what is called public spirit ... therefore, I shall think my time not ill-spent if I can persuade most and all of you who hear me, to shew the love you have for your country by endeavouring in your several situations to do all the public good you can. For I am certain persuaded that all our misfortunes arise from no other original cause than that general disregard among us to the public welfare.|$|E

2500|$|In the end, {{she imagines}} {{there are women}} {{creeping}} around behind the patterns of the wallpaper and comes to believe {{she is one of}} them. She locks herself in the room, now the only place she feels safe, refusing to leave when the summer rental is up. [...] "For outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green instead of yellow. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits in that long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Comey {{informed}} Congress of {{this additional}} investigation despite having been advised by Justice Department officials {{that such an}} announcement would violate department policies and procedures, including a policy not to comment on investigations close to an election. Comey later explained, {{in a letter to}} FBI employees, [...] "We don't ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed." [...] Law enforcement sources added that he feared he would be accused of concealing relevant information if he did not disclose it.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} we {{returned}} down Broadway, {{it seemed to me}} that the city was flying before some awful calamity. [...] "Why," [...] said I, [...] "Colonel, what under heaven is the matter? Everyone appears to be pitching out their furniture, and packing it off." [...] He laughed, and said this was the general [...] "moving day." [...] Such a sight nobody ever saw unless it was in this same city. It seemed a kind of frolic, as if they were changing houses just for fun. Every street was crowded with carts, drays, and people. So the world goes. It would take a good deal to get me out of my log-house; <b>but</b> <b>here,</b> <b>I</b> understand, many persons [...] "move" [...] every year.|$|E

2500|$|Love {{made several}} {{responses}} to the rumors, first in 1998: [...] "All this time I have never addressed this. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> am finally saying {{for the very first}} time that Kurt did not [...] Live Through This. I mean for fuck's sake, his skills were much better than mine at the timethe songs would have been much better. That's the first thing." [...] Love later addressed the issue, stating: [...] "I wanted to be better than Kurt. I was really competing with Kurt. And that's why it always offends me when people would say, [...] "Oh, he wrote Live Through This." [...] I'd be proud as hell to say that he wrote something on it, but I wouldn't let him. It was too Yoko [...] for me. It's like, [...] "No fucking way, man! I've got a good band, I don't fucking need your help." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I know, I know," [...] he cried. [...] "We can't help that, Jim, now. I'll {{take it on}} my shoulders, holus bolus, {{blame and}} shame, my boy; <b>but</b> stay <b>here</b> <b>I</b> cannot let you. Jump! One jump, and you're out, and we'll run for it like antelopes." ...|$|R

6000|$|Indeed I KNEW. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> {{believed}} I understood Consuelo, and was relieved. I even {{ventured to}} say gently, [...] "And you are better?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Very often I beg myself; but, as thou knowest, <b>I</b> am seldom <b>here,</b> {{except when}} <b>I</b> come to {{look again at}} my disciple.
