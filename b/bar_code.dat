40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The aim was {{to assess}} the value of <b>bar</b> <b>coding,</b> {{together}} with developed microcomputer programs, as a tool to speed up mailing and handling of return responses of a survey where over 4000 adolescents received a mailed questionnaire. DESIGN [...] <b>Bar</b> <b>codes</b> were used for displaying the identification number of a questionnaire, as well as each response alternative and number of the question. These <b>bar</b> <b>codes</b> were read by a wand, a handhold scanner, connected to a microcomputer and the data were automatically entered into a computer data file. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS [...] Compared with previous similar surveys, the use of <b>bar</b> <b>codes</b> did not seem to affect a manner of responding. <b>Bar</b> <b>coding</b> saved human steps in handling of return responses, reduced an error rate, and helped to control the process of work. <b>Bar</b> <b>coding</b> is recommended as a new technical tool for preparations of future large scale surveys...|$|R

These molecular cytogenetic tools facilitate chromosome identification and the delineation of both inter- and intra-chromosomal rearrangements. We present an overview of the various conceptual approaches which can be largely divided into two classes: Simple <b>bar</b> <b>codes</b> designed for chromosome identification and complex <b>bar</b> <b>codes</b> for high resolution aberration screening of entire karyotypes. We address the issue of color redundancy and how to overcome this limitation by complementation of <b>bar</b> <b>codes</b> with whole chromosome painting probes. Copyright (c) 2006 S.

25|$|The printed format {{has gone}} through several changes. The first publications, in 1967–72, were in folded tabloid {{newspaper}} format, with no staples, black ink text, and a single color highlight that changed each edition. From 1973 onwards, editions were produced on a four-color press with a different newsprint paper size. In 1979, the <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> appeared. In 1980, it became a gloss-paper, large format (10"×12") magazine. As of edition of October 30, 2008, Rolling Stone has had a smaller, standard-format magazine size.|$|E

25|$|The first desktop {{programmable}} calculators {{were produced}} in the mid-1960s by Mathatronics and Casio (AL-1000). These machines were very heavy and costly. The first programmable pocket calculator was the HP-65, in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. Two years later the HP-25C introduced continuous memory, i.e., programs and data were retained in CMOS memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first alphanumeric, programmable, expandable calculator, the HP-41C. It could be expanded with random access memory (RAM, for memory) and read-only memory (ROM, for software) modules, and peripherals like <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> readers, microcassette and floppy disk drives, paper-roll thermal printers, and miscellaneous communication interfaces (RS-232, HP-IL, HP-IB).|$|E

25|$|During the 1970s and 1980s Grand Trunk Western would {{continue}} to improve its efficiency and embark on efforts to improve its operating ratio. It had consolidated some of its operations including dispatching in Pontiac, locomotive maintenance in Battle Creek and railcar maintenance in Port Huron. Its intercity passenger train operations would be handed over to Amtrak in 1971. Responsibility for GTW's commuter rail operation in Detroit was turned over in 1974 to the regional transportation authority SEMTA. GTW moved into the intermodal freight business by creating intermodal transfer yards in Chicago in 1975 and suburban Detroit, in 1978. The railroad's president at the time, John H. Burdakin, was also a proponent of the Automatic Car Identification (ACI) system. It was a means to identify the location of shipments and equipment with <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> labels {{on the sides of}} freight cars and locomotives. The labels were read by automatic scanners at various rail yards. When Conrail was formed in 1976 GTW sought to acquire some of its routes in Michigan. It gained 151 miles (243km) of trackage between Saginaw and Bay City as well as near Muskegon and Midland, Michigan. Several of GTW's cuts in its expenditures came from reductions in its workforce through changes it negotiated in union work rules. In 1978 it discontinued its Lake Michigan railcar ferry operations after consecutive years of financial losses over $1 million. By 1987 the company sold its headquarters building on Lafayette Avenue in Detroit and moved to the new office park complex Brewery Park. The complex was developed {{on the site of the}} former Stroh's Brewery near downtown Detroit. Locomotive performance was also enhanced with a rebuilding program of its EMD GP9s.|$|E

The IEMA release further stated that identification was needed to secure the purchase of Mature-rated games at roughly the same rate as was needed for R-rated film admission. In compliance with the ESRB's further demand that Bethesda request retailers [...] "to adhere to their respective store policies not to sell the newly rated M (Mature) game to those under the age of 17," [...] several retailers had begun to include cash register prompts tied to the game's <b>bar</b> <b>code,</b> instructing the cashier to ask for ID.
