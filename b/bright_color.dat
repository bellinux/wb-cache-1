5|$|At the lek, {{males have}} been {{observed}} to break up into pairs, performing “confrontation displays”. This consists of facing each other while bowing, jumping, and flapping their wings, sometimes even snapping their bills, {{and at the same}} time giving off various squawking and grunting calls. When the female approaches, it becomes even more intense. The display turns into a cacophony of <b>bright</b> <b>color</b> and a frenzied activity filling the air with very strange sounds.|$|E
5|$|The antbirds are a {{large family}} of small {{passerine}} birds of subtropical and tropical Central and South America. They are forest birds which tend to feed on insects {{at or near the}} ground. A sizable minority of them specialize in following columns of army ants to eat small invertebrates that leave their hiding places to flee from the ants. Many species lack <b>bright</b> <b>color,</b> with brown, black, and white being the dominant tones.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{undergoes a}} molt {{in the spring}} and autumn. It is the only cardueline finch to undergo a molt twice a year. During the winter molt it sheds all its feathers; in the spring, it sheds all but the wing and tail feathers, which are dark brown in the female and black in the male. The markings on these feathers remain through each molt, with bars on the wings and white under and {{at the edges of the}} short, notched tail. The sexual dimorphism displayed in plumage coloration is especially pronounced after the spring molt, when the <b>bright</b> <b>color</b> of the male's summer plumage is needed to attract a mate.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>bright</b> <b>colored</b> throats {{also give}} the lizards a fitness {{advantage}} because the <b>bright</b> <b>colored</b> throats attract more females, and therefore those males {{are more likely}} to reproduce. Although the <b>bright</b> <b>colored</b> throats increases the likelihood of being eaten by predators, it also increases their sexual success. Therefore, the prevalence of <b>bright</b> <b>colored</b> throats is maintained in this population of lizards. Based on the conflicting benefits of dull and <b>bright</b> <b>colored</b> throats, it is understandable that both morphs have been maintained in this species. Both traits give the lizards a different evolutionary advantage.|$|R
5000|$|By the 1950s, {{many people}} {{began to think of}} royal blue as a <b>brighter</b> <b>color,</b> and it is this <b>brighter</b> <b>color</b> that was chosen as the web color [...] "royal blue" [...] (the web colors when they were {{formulated}} in 1987 were originally known as the X11 colors).

5|$|As {{with all}} members of its genus, C.cinnabarinum is {{generally}} considered inedible by field guides. Because the fruit bodies begin development underground, they are too tough for consumption {{by the time they}} are visible, and their appearance may be considered unappetizing. A study of the cultural practices of mestizo descendants of the Otomi people in Tenango de Doria, Mexico, reported that immature specimens of C.cinnabarinum, known locally as yemitas, were frequently eaten raw in the past, especially by children. Consumption of the species was no longer commonplace, with only five of the 450 locals interviewed familiar with the practice. The gleba of C.cinnabarinum has been described as having a mild taste and, despite a local recollection to the contrary, is not sweet. C.cinnabarinum has also been used in traditional medicine. A 1986 ethnomycological study of native traditions in Veracruz identified this use of huang noono, which locals roasted, then consumed as a powder with mineral water to treat gastrointestinal distress. Unlike these Mexican traditions, Hunan folk beliefs hold that the mushroom is poisonous on account of its <b>bright</b> <b>color.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since {{the human}} eye has three types of color sensors that respond to {{different}} ranges of wavelengths, a full plot of all visible colors is a three-dimensional figure. However, the concept of color {{can be divided into}} two parts: brightness and chromaticity. For example, the color white is a <b>bright</b> <b>color,</b> while the color grey {{is considered to be a}} less bright version of that same white. In other words, the chromaticity of white and grey are the same while their brightness differs.|$|E
25|$|Fancy Dance or Fancy Feather Dance (Northern and Southern styles): A dance {{featuring}} vivid regalia {{with dramatic}} movement, including spins and leaps. Often the biggest crowd-pleasing competition of a pow wow. Aside from <b>bright</b> <b>color</b> and non-traditional materials, fancy dancers are also distinguished {{by use of}} a two-bustle design on their regalia. There are two styles of the roach: In the North, {{it is the same}} as the grass dance roach, in the South, the roaches have rockers, two feathers on springs that rock back and forth.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} use of {{feathers}} in modern Mexico {{is in the}} creation of traditional dance costumes. These include the headdresses for dances such as the Quetzales in Puebla and the Concheros performed in various parts of central Mexico. In Oaxaca, there is the Dance of the Feather, which used dyed ostrich feathers and for the Dance of Calala, in Suchiapa, Chiapas, the main dancer uses a fan of turkey and rooster feathers. Ostrich feathers are the most common in traditional dance costumes, followed by rooster, turkey and hen feathers. Despite their <b>bright</b> <b>color,</b> peacock feathers are rarely used. In most cases, the symbolic meaning of the feathers has been forgotten. One notable exception is the Huichols, who have maintained much of their original cosmology.|$|E
25|$|Ivey was {{acquainted with}} Mark Tobey, Morris Graves, {{and other members}} of the 'Northwest School', and was close friends with Richard Gilkey and many of the Skagit Valley-based {{painters}} who were considered by some critics to represent a second generation of the Northwest School. However, his deeply personal style of abstraction showed more of the influence of Still, Rothko, and others he studied under at the California School of Fine Arts. He found inspiration in observation of the real world, but his intense immersion in the painting process transformed what he saw into lush abstractions that emphasized color and the picture plane. In Ivey's paintings, shapes are secondary to color in the development of spaces, and delicate neutral grays set off glowing patches of <b>bright</b> <b>color.</b>|$|E
25|$|Her {{changeable}} {{nature is}} reflected throughout her work, {{which has led}} critics and scholars to have very different conclusions about her and her work. Her style often goes {{back and forth between}} classic structure and baroque action, open form and hard-edge shape, and <b>bright</b> <b>color</b> and monochrome palette. Throughout her career, she refused to adopt a singular, recognizable style and instead embraced change through varying the mood, subject matter, texture, materials, and compositions of her work often. By changing her work style often, she differed from other abstract expressionists since many of them adopted unchanging identities and modes of depiction. Despite these intense variations, her works can typically be recognized through their gestural style, texture, rhythm, and depiction of organic imagery. Her interest in the self, nature, and modern life are themes which commonly surface in her works. Krasner is often reluctant to discuss the iconography of her work and instead emphasizes the importance of her biography since she claims her art is formed through her individual personality and her emotional state.|$|E

500|$|Conspicuousness and {{toxicity}} may be inversely related, as polymorphic poison dart frogs {{that are}} less conspicuous are more toxic than the brightest and most conspicuous species. [...] Energetic costs of producing toxins and <b>bright</b> <b>color</b> pigments lead to potential trade-offs between toxicity and bright coloration, and prey with strong secondary defenses have less to gain from costly signaling. Therefore, prey populations that are more toxic are predicted to manifest less bright signals, opposing the classical view that increased conspicuousness always evolves with increased toxicity.|$|E

The people whose bad deeds are sensed by David are identified by an article of clothing in a single <b>bright</b> <b>color</b> (red, orange), to contrast them with the dark and dreary color scheme typical {{of the rest of}} the movie (but not of most comic books). Several scenes also depict characters through reflections or doorways, as if framing them in a picture similar to comic books.|$|E

500|$|In 1904 Romaine Brooks, {{the name}} she preferred, became {{dissatisfied}} with her work, {{and in particular}} with the <b>bright</b> <b>color</b> schemes that she had used in her early paintings. She travelled to St. Ives on the Cornish coast, rented a small studio, and began learning to create finer gradations of gray. When a group of local artists asked her to give an informal show of her work, she displayed only some pieces of cardboard on which she had dabbed her experiments with gray paint. From then on, nearly all of her paintings are keyed to a gray, white and black color scheme with touches and tints of ochre, umber, alizarin and teal. By 1905 she had found her tonal palette and would continue to develop these harmonics her whole career.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} game's {{welcoming}} aesthetics, and some, its visual design. Kill Screen considered the game's affect delightful and Destructoid said its <b>bright</b> <b>color</b> scheme and rubber-like surfaces were disarming and recalled {{the feel of}} an inflatable castle. Polygon reviewer described the title as having [...] "old-school sensibilities" [...] in its arcade-style visual design, with simple geometry and flat 2D art.

Calixto of Kill Screen concluded that Videoball [...] "feels like it's trying to knock down barriers to entry" [...] in its [...] "bubbly and peaceful" [...] visual design, with gradients and 90s Japanese arcade-style music.

[...] By contrast, IGN reviewer Levi Buchanan noted the Game Gear's biggest fault was its game library when compared to the Game Boy, stating that [...] "the software was completely lacking compared to its chief rival, which was bathed in quality games. It didn't matter that the Game Gear was more powerful. The color screen did not reverse any fortunes. Content and innovation beat out technology, a formula that Nintendo is using right now with the continued ascendance of the DS and Wii." [...] Buchanan later went on to praise some parts of the Game Gear's library, however, stating [...] "Some of those Master System tweaks were very good games, and fun is resilient against time." [...] Retro Gamer praised Sega's accomplishment in surviving against the competition of Nintendo in the handheld console market with the Game Gear, noting that [...] "for all the handhelds that have gone up against the might of Nintendo and ultimately lost out, Sega's Game Gear managed to last the longest, only outdone in sales by the Sony PSP.
