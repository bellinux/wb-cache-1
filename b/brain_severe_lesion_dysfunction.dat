40|$|Background and Purpose. The {{purposes}} of this study were to evaluate the effects of preterm birth, <b>severe</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lesions,</b> and postterm age on kicking movements of young infants and to compare the prognostic value of kinematic analysis of kicking with a qualitative assessment of infants' spontaneous movements. Subjects. The subjects were 12 full-term infants without brain injury, 12 low-risk preterm infants without brain injury, and 11 preterm infants with <b>severe</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lesions</b> (periventricular leukomalacia). Methods. Videotape recordings of each infant's motor behavior in a supine position were made at 1 and 3 months postterm age. Kicking frequency, temporal organization of the kick cycle, coordination among different joints, and interlimb coordination were measured. A qualitative assessment for lower-extremity movements and a Gestalt judgment of general movement quality according to Prechtl's method were made from the same videotape recordings. Results. Kinematic analysis showed only mild differences among the 3 groups of infants. Qualitative assessment of the lower-extremity movements, however, showed that preterm infants with brain lesions, and particularly those who later were found to have cerebral palsy, consistently had fewer segmental movements of the foot and abnormal general movements at bell? ages. Conclusion and Discussion. The data suggest that the mechanisms responsible for kicking movements in newborns and young infants {{do not appear to be}} influenced by the extrauterine environment or by brain lesions; at least at the ages studied. Qualitative assessment of lower-extremity and general movements seems to be more appropriate for clinical purposes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is {{the most}} common {{congenital}} viral infection, causing hearing, visual and psychomotor impairment. Preexisting maternal CMV immunity substantially reduces, but not eliminates, the risk of fetal infection and affectation. This article is about a case of nonprimary maternal CMV infection during pregnancy, with vertical transmission, resulting in severe fetal affectation. Preconceptional analysis indicated maternal CMV past infection. Pregnancy progressed uneventfully until the 20 th week ultrasound (US), which revealed cerebral abnormalities: thin and hyperechogenic cerebral cortex with prominent lateral ventricles, bilateral periventricular hyperechogenicities, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and absent corpus callosum. The MRI suggested these findings were compatible with congenital infection rather than primary brain malformation. The fetal karyotype was normal. The title of CMV's IgG antibodies almost tripled. Since the first semester,analysisof the polymerasechainreaction(PCR) forCMVDNAintheamniotic fluid was negative. The pregnancy was terminatedat 23 weeks.

40|$|Background: Maturation of amplitude-integrated {{electroencephalogram}} (aEEG) {{activity is}} influenced by both gestational age (GA) and postmenstrual age. It is not fully known how this process {{is influenced by}} cerebral lesions. Objective: To compare early aEEG developmental changes between preterm newborns with different degrees of cerebral lesions on cranial ultrasound (cUS). Methods: Prospective cohort study on preterm newborns with GA < 32. 0 weeks, undergoing continuous aEEG recording during the first 84 h after birth. aEEG characteristics were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated using pre-established criteria. Based on cUS findings three groups were formed: normal (n = 78), mild (n = 20), and <b>severe</b> cerebral <b>lesions</b> (n = 6). Linear mixed models for repeated measures were used to analyze aEEG maturational trajectories. Results: 104 newborns with a mean GA (range) 29. 5 (24. 4 - 31. 7) weeks, and birth weight 1, 220 (580 - 2, 020) g were recruited. Newborns with <b>severe</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lesions</b> started with similar aEEG scores and tendentially lower aEEG amplitudes than newborns without brain lesions, and showed a slower development of the cyclic activity (p < 0. 001), but a more rapid increase of the maximum and minimum aEEG amplitudes (p = 0. 002 and p = 0. 04). Conclusions: Preterm infants with <b>severe</b> cerebral <b>lesions</b> manifest a maturational delay in the aEEG cyclic activity already early after birth, but show a catch-up of aEEG amplitudes to that of newborns without cerebral lesions. Changes in the maturational aEEG pattern may be a marker of <b>severe</b> neurological <b>lesions</b> in the preterm infant...|$|R
40|$|Outcomes of Zika virus (ZIKV) {{infection}} in pregnant women vary from {{the birth of}} asymptomatic offspring to abnormal development and <b>severe</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lesions</b> in fetuses and infants. There are concerns that offspring affected in utero and born without apparent symptoms may develop mental illnesses. Therefore, animal models are important to test interventions against in utero infection and health sequelae in symptomatic and likely more widespread asymptomatic offspring. To partially reproduce in utero {{infection in}} humans, we directly inoculated selected porcine conceptuses with ZIKV. Inoculation resulted in rapid trans-fetal infections, persistent infection in conceptuses, molecular pathology in fetal brains, fetal antibody and type I interferon responses. Offspring infected in utero showed ZIKV in their fetal membranes collected after birth. Some in utero affected piglets were small, depressed, had undersized brains, and showed seizures. Some piglets showed potentially increased activity. Our data suggest that porcine model of persistent in utero ZIKV infection has a strong potential for translational research {{and can be used}} to test therapeutic interventions in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Survival of {{extremely}} {{low birth weight}} infants has dramatically improved {{in the last decade}} of the twentieth century. The objective of our study was to evaluate the neurological evolution of the surviving infants because frequent motor, sensitive and psychological disturbances are related. Prospective, longitudinal study in a population of newborns, nursed in our neonatal intensive care unit and born between 1992 and 2001 with less than 1. 000 g and/or less than 28 weeks of gestational age (GA). Neurological assessment of outcome was made using the neurodevelopmental score (O. M. S. 1988) at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months. Neurological follow-up every year and neuropsychological testing at 3, 5 and 8 years. Only children with at least 2 years of follow-up were included. The children were grouped in 3 categories: M (major neurological handicap), m (minor neurological handicap), N (normal neurological outcome). To evaluate the evolution with time, we compared the results from the first period (1992 to 1996) to the second part of this decade (1997 to 2001). Mortality fell from 38 % (27 / 70) in the first period (1992 - 1996) to 18 % (8 / 44) in the second one (1997 - 2001) (p = 0. 02) including neonates of less than 25 weeks GA. Neurodevelopmental status improved and <b>severe</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lesions</b> decreased (25 % with intraventricular haemorrhage III & IV and cystic periventricular leukomalacia versus 6 % in the second period) (p = 0. 017). Major handicap fell from 26 % (9 / 34) to 16 % (5 / 31) and normal neurological evolution raised from 15 % (5 / 34) to 48 % (15 / 31) (p = 0. 013). With the survival of newborns less than 28 weeks, the severe ocular complications increased: 6 % (5 / 79). In conclusion, mortality and quality of life have significantly improved in the past 10 years in our service. <b>Severe</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lesions</b> have decreased under a better multifactorial management.

30|$|This {{study was}} led under {{conditions}} enabling a state-of-play of ongoing practices without the physicians responsible for WoWt decisions being pressured by any moral dilemma {{between the individual}} interest of the dying patient and the collective benefit for potential graft recipients. Although not expressly forbidden under current French law, organ harvesting after controlled circulatory death is still not practiced “so as to rule out any potential tension between the decision to withdraw treatment and the intention to harvest organs” [7]. In other countries, teams involved in organ retrieval after controlled death consider organ donation as a routine part of end-of-life care once it is established that the patient wishes to be a donor [10, 22, 30, 31]. Of the 32 patients theoretically eligible as organ donors before effective WoWt measures in our study, 22 presented <b>severe</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lesions</b> and were de facto, unable to express their wishes.

40|$|Proton {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to study the brain of 2 normal and 15 abnormal infants aged from 33 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) to 14 months postnatal age. Eleven of the infants were examined {{on at least two}} occasions. The principal clinical diagnoses in the abnormal infants were perinatal ischemic and hemorrhagic brain injury. All proton spectra demonstrated peaks that were assigned to N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline containing compounds (Cho), and creatine plus phosphocreatine (Cr). The NAA/Cho and NAA/Cr ratios increased with age, while the Cho/Cr ratio decreased with age in the majority of infants. The NAA/Cho ratio was generally lower in abnormal infants, but the difference was not apparent before 40 weeks (PMA). This ratio was lowest in infants with the severest degree of neurological abnormality. Proton and phosphorus MRS was compared in seven infants. In those with <b>severe</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lesions,</b> early phosphorus spectra were abnormal. On follow-up the phosphorus spectra became normal, but the proton spectra showed persistently low NAA/Cho and NAA/Cr ratios.

The brain is much more susceptible to the deleterious effects of ammonium in childhood than in adulthood. Hyperammonemia provokes irreversible damage to the developing central nervous system: cortical atrophy, ventricular enlargement and demyelination lead to cognitive impairment, seizures and cerebral palsy. The mechanisms leading to these <b>severe</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lesions</b> are still not well understood, but recent studies show that ammonium exposure alters several amino acid pathways and neurotransmitter systems, cerebral energy metabolism, nitric oxide synthesis, oxidative stress and signal transduction pathways. All in all, at the cellular level, these are associated with alterations in neuronal differentiation and patterns of cell death. Recent advances in imaging techniques are increasing our understanding of these processes through detailed in vivo longitudinal analysis of neurobiochemical changes associated with hyperammonemia. Further, several potential neuroprotective strategies have been put forward recently, including the use of NMDA receptor antagonists, nitric oxide inhibitors, creatine, acetyl-L-carnitine, CNTF or inhibitors of MAPKs and glutamine synthetase. Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy will ultimately be a powerful tool to measure the effects of these neuroprotective approaches...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the efficiency of spiral CT (SCT) aortography for diagnosing acute aortic lesions in blunt thoracic trauma patients. Between October 1992 and June 1997, 487 SCT scans of the chest were performed on blunt thoracic trauma patients. To assess aortic injury, the following SCT criteria were considered: hemomediastinum, peri-aortic hematoma, irregular aspect of the aortic wall, aortic pseudodiverticulum, intimal flap and traumatic dissection. Aortic injury was diagnosed on 14 SCT examinations (2. 9 %), five of the patients having had an additional digital aortography that confirmed the aortic trauma. Twelve subjects underwent surgical repair of the thoracic aorta, which in all but one case confirmed the aortic injury. Two patients died before surgery from <b>severe</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lesions.</b> The aortic blunt lesions were confirmed at autopsy. According to the follow-up of the other 473 patients, we are aware of no false-negative SCT examination.

It is concluded that SCT aortagraphy is an accurate diagnostic method for the assessment of aortic injury in blunt thoracic trauma patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We review two {{complementary}} MRI imaging modalities {{to characterize}} {{structure and function}} of neuronal networks in the human brain, and their application to subjects with <b>severe</b> <b>brain</b> injury. The structural imaging modality, diffusion tensor imaging, is based on imaging the diffusion of water protons in the brain parenchyma. From the diffusion tensor, several quantities characterizing fiber structure in the brain can be derived. The principal direction of the diffusion tensor {{has been found to}} depend on the fiber direction of myelinated axons. It can be used for white matter fiber tracking. The anisotropy (or directional dependence) of diffusion {{has been shown to be}} sensitive to developmental as well as white matter changes during training and recovery from brain injury. The functional MRI imaging modality, resting state fMRI, concerns the functional connectivity of neuronal networks rather than their anatomical structure. Subjects undergo a conventional fMRI imaging protocol without performing specific tasks. Various resting state network patterns can be computed by algorithms that reveal correlations in the fMRI signal. Often, thalamic structures are involved, suggesting that resting state fMRI could reflect global brain network functionality. Clinical applications of resting state fMRI have been reported, in particular relating signal abnormalities to neurodegenerative processes. To better understand to which degree resting state patterns reflect neuronal network function, we are comparing network patterns of normal subjects with those having <b>severe</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lesions</b> in a small pilot study...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY The {{association}} between non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke {{has been studied}} in 402 patients consecutively admitted to a stroke unit. Brain infarction patients with sinus rhythm (n = 196) and non-rheumatic AF (n = 92) were further compared. Some findings supported an embolic origin of the stroke: half of the deceased AF patients (n = 24) at autopsy either had left atrial thrombosis or arterial embolism compared to none of the ten with sinus rhythm. Patients with AF also had a higher mortality and more <b>severe</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lesions,</b> findings compatible with a sudden occlusion of blood flow. However, these differences might also be explained by an atherothrombotic occlusion with impaired autoregulation in the ischaemic region in conjunction with heart failure, which was {{more common in the}} AF patients. Other findings supporting an atherothrombotic mechanism were: the prevalence of AF was higher (19 - 29 %) in all kinds of stroke, including haemorrhage, than in age-matched controls (3 - 9 %). Also patients with previous AF and no present embolic source resembled the whole AF group and differed from patients with sinus rhythm. Thus embolism is a plausible cause of stroke in many AF patients, whereas an atherothrombotic origin is more likely in others. Characteristics identifying the mechanism in an individual case were not found. Stroke Vol 16, No 2, 198...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that mitochondrial lesions of specific severity and morphology could be produced in myocardial cells by laser micro-beam irradiation. This paper (i) describes four general categories of contractility responses resulting from irradiation of a single mitochondrion in a beating myocardial cell (group I, no change; group II, change followed by return to rhythmic contractions; group III, cessation of contraction; group IV, cell death); (ii) correlates mitochondrial lesion type with functional response; and (iii) distinguishes between physiological deprivation of mitochondria within the cell and secondary effects due to laser energy dissipation. Of the 22 contracting cells that were altered but did not die (groups II and III) 18 returned to rhythmic contractility statistically similar to the pre-irradiation contraction rate. A definite correlation between lesion severity and functional response was noted: only cells in Group I (no change) had the least <b>severe</b> <b>lesion</b> type (8 / 14), and none had the most <b>severe</b> <b>lesion</b> type. Twenty of 22 cells in groups II and III had moderate type lesions, and of the 20 cells in group IV (cell death), 18 had the most <b>severe</b> <b>lesion</b> type. The short term physiological effects upon cell contractility (up to 30 minutes post-irradiation) of selective mitochondrial deletion were determined. Up to 36 large mitochondria were destroyed with the least <b>severe</b> <b>lesion</b> type, and no change in cell contractility was observed. This contrasts with the rapid cell death often obtained by destroying a single mitochondrion with the <b>severe</b> <b>lesion</b> type. The morphology and laser effects precipitating cell death are discussed. Quiescent cells have been stimulated to contract by irradiation and a few have continued to contract up to 5 minutes post-irradiation.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Over {{the last}} decades, {{considerable}} {{progress has been}} made in the perinatal management of high-risk preterm neonates, changing the landscape of pathological conditions associated with neurological impairments. Major focal destructive lesions are now less common, and the predominant neuropathological lesion is diffuse white-matter damage in the most immature infants. Similarly, over the last few years, we have observed a trend towards a decrease in neurological impairment in the absence of treatments specifically aimed at neuroprotection. OBJECTIVES: We examined whether recent changes in treatment strategies in perinatal care during the perinatal period could have had an indirect beneficial impact on the occurrence of brain lesions and their consequences. METHODS: Thus, we reviewed the effects of the most common treatments administered during the perinatal period to the mother or to very preterm infants on brain damage and neurocognitive follow-up. RESULTS: Antenatal steroids and exogenous surfactant are the two main treatments capable of leading to neuroprotection in very preterm infants. Randomized controlled trials are currently investigating the effects of inhaled nitric oxide and erythropoietin, while antenatal magnesium sulphate and caffeine are also likely to provide some neuroprotection, but this needs to be further investigated. Finally, other common treatments against pain, haemodynamic failure and patent ductus arteriosus have conflicting or no effects on the developing brain. CONCLUSION: While specific neuroprotective drugs are still awaited, recent advances in perinatal care have been associated with an unexpected but significant decrease in the incidence of both <b>severe</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lesions</b> and neurological impairment...|$|R

At 24 h following the lesion, lumbar spinal cord levels of [Met]enkephalin, as measured by radioimmunoassay, were elevated (70 %) bilaterally in both hemisegments, ipsi- and contralateral to the lesion.

Objective: To evaluate AVID serum levels in SBL and BD patients. Design: Prospective, open label, observational trial. Setting: A general teaching hospital. Method: Three groups of adult subjects (age {{greater than or}} equal to 18 y) of both sexes were included in this study: control group: 29 healthy volunteers; SBL group: 17 patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) : less than or equal to 8; and BD group: 11 brain-dead patients. Samples of venous blood were collected in the morning at rest from healthy volunteers and at 8 hourly intervals over a period of 24 h from SBL and BID patients for AVP determinations. Concomitantly, some clinical and laboratorial variables were also recorded. Results: AVP serum levels (pg/ml) were [mean (SD); median]: control [2. 2 (1. 1); 2. 01; SBL [5. 7 (6. 3); 2. 9]; and BID [2. 6 (1. 0); 2. 81. AVID serum levels varied greatly in SBL patients, but without statistically significant difference in relation to the other groups (p= 0. 06).

Assessment of contents of intervention may improve understanding of working mechanisms. Therefore, we compared effects - including analyses of contents of physiotherapy - of COPCA (COPing with and CAring for infants with special needs) and Typical Infant Physiotherapy (TIP). Patients and method: Forty-three very high risk (VHR) -infants were included before 9 months corrected age (CA), based on either a <b>severe</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lesion</b> or clear neurological dysfunction. They {{were randomly assigned to}} receive 1 year of intervention, COPCA (n= 23) or TIP (n= 20). Infants were assessed at baseline, after 3, 6 and 12 months, and at 21 months CA with a large battery of neuromotor, cognitive, functional and family tests, with the Infant Motor Profile (IMP) as primary outcome. Physiotherapeutic intervention sessions were videotaped and quantitatively analyzed. Statistics included factoranalysis, partial correlations and multivariable mixed-effects models. Results: At RCT-level, cross-sectional outcome of COPCA and TIP was similar on primary and secondary outcomes. Mixed-effect models did not show significant differences over time between COPCA and TIP on total IMP-score. Process analyses revealed virtually no associations between physiotherapy and outcome.

Diastolic cerebral blood flow velocities and pulsatility index measurements were different between patients with SND and patients with no SND. Using receiver-operating characteristic analysis, we found the best threshold limits to be 25 cm/s (sensitivity, 92 %; specificity, 76 %; area under curve, 0. 93) for diastolic cerebral blood flow velocity and 1. 25 (sensitivity, 90 %; specificity, 91 %; area under curve, 0. 95) for pulsatility index. According to a recursive-partitioning analysis, TCDB classification and TCD measurements were the most discriminative among variables to detect {{patients at}} risk for SND. CONCLUSION: In patients with no <b>severe</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lesions</b> on CT after mild to moderate traumatic brain injury, TCD on admission, in complement with brain CT scan, could accurately screen patients at risk for SND...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} whether more thanone observer or fractional flow reserve has the same resultsin assessing coronary lesion severity in intermediatelesions. Methods: Our hospital’s database was searched for fractionalflow reserve procedures and then these patient’slesions were assessed visually by three experienced interventionalcardiologist. Results: 8 of 46 patients were (17. 4 %) female and 38 of 46 were (82, 6 %) male. Average age was 61 ± 11 years (Male: 60 ± 11 / Female: 70 ± 7 years). One observer could onlydetect 66. 7 % of <b>severe</b> <b>lesions</b> and 76. 2 % of non-severelesions. When two observers agreed about lesion severity,true detection of <b>severe</b> <b>lesions</b> was (max) 76. 7 %, andtrue detection of non-severe lesions was (max) 66. 7 %, soa decrease in true detection of non-severe lesions wasobserved. When one of the observers called a lesion “severe”and the lesion was assumed as “severe”, detectionof a <b>severe</b> <b>lesion</b> was 83. 3 % (p= 0. 017); {{if all of the}} observersagreed that the lesion was “non-severe” then truedetection of a non-severe lesion was 90. 5 % (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: One observer can’t detect a lesion severitysufficiently, but when three observers’ information wasevaluated, there was nearly 90 % concordance with fractionalflow reserve results.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Studies using brain-imaging {{techniques}} have shown changes in regional blood flow (rCBF) {{in patients with}} liver cirrhosis. It remains unknown whether the aetiology of liver disease accounts for these changes. AIMS: To evaluate whether the aetiology of liver cirrhosis is associated with different patterns of rCBF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 patients with end-stage liver disease and no overt encephalopathy were studied. Thirteen age-matched subjects admitted to the neurology department for headache were used as controls. Exclusion criteria were focal <b>brain</b> <b>lesions,</b> <b>severe</b> <b>brain</b> atrophy and any abnormalities found on computed tomography scan suggesting other central nervous system diseases, alcohol intake or use of neuroactive drugs for at least 6 months. rCBF was assessed using single-positron-emission tomography (SPECT) with 99 mTc-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99 mTc-HM-PAO) as a tracer in all patients and controls. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The liver-disease aetiology was as follows: alcoholic (A) in 19 patients; viral (V) (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis D virus, hepatitis C virus) in 14 patients; alcoholic with concomitant viral (A + V) in five patients; and cholestatic (C) (primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis) in 12 patients. SPECT showed significantly lower rCBF in cirrhotic patients than in controls for most cortical and subcortical regions and in alcoholic and viral patients than in cholestatic liver disease patients for some cortical regions. When patients were grouped according to previous alcohol abuse (including cases with a concomitant viral aetiology), rCBF was significantly lower in the frontal superior, medial and temporal inferior regions in the alcoholic group. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral blood flow is significantly lower in patients with liver cirrhosis than in controls and, among cirrhotics, it is lower in alcoholic and viral cirrhosis than in cholestatic liver disease. In patients with previous alcohol abuse, cerebral blood flow was significantly more reduced in the frontal and temporal regions compared with patients without previous alcohol abuse...|$|R

30|$|Subtle endometriosis is scored {{separately}} from typical lesions. By pathology, they are different, the former being active lesions, {{the latter being}} burnt-out lesions. Subtle lesions in contrast with typical lesions are not associated with the LUF syndrome while no data indicate today that subtle lesions cause pain or infertility. Another important argument to score subtle lesions separately is that typical lesions are readily recognized during laparoscopy, whereas the recognition of subtle lesions varies with the expertise and the scrutiny of the surgeon. A separate classification will permit to evaluate whether subtle lesions are clinically important for pain, infertility, progression, and most importantly whether subtle <b>lesions</b> predict more <b>severe</b> <b>lesions</b> in the future. For the patient, it indeed would be important to know whether subtle lesions herald the onset of more <b>severe</b> <b>lesions</b> or whether they should be considered less important.|$|R
