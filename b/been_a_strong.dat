5|$|The Killer {{was not an}} {{immediate}} success in Hong Kong, but received critical acclaim in the Western world with reviewers praising the action scenes and its over-the-top style. The film became Woo's stepping stone to make Hollywood films and has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> influence on many directors, including Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez and Johnnie To.|$|E
5|$|The Scott Wilson Report did not {{consider}} extending the line beyond Tweedbank due to the increased capital and operating costs of continuing further without a corresponding increase in passenger demand. The Campaign for Borders Rail consider nevertheless that there would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> case for reaching Melrose {{on the basis of}} the town's role in Borders tourism.|$|E

5|$|Fox started {{displaying}} {{symptoms of}} early-onset Parkinson's disease in 1991 while shooting the movie Doc Hollywood, {{although he was}} not properly diagnosed until the next year. After his diagnosis, Fox started drinking heavily. He sought help and stopped drinking altogether. In 1998, {{he decided to go}} public with his condition, and since then, he has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> advocate of Parkinson's disease research. His foundation, The Michael J. Fox Foundation, was created to help advance every promising research path to curing Parkinson's disease, including embryonic stem cell studies.|$|E
5|$|Jim Carrey was {{considered}} for the part of Jack Sparrow. However, the production schedule for The Curse of the Black Pearl conflicted with Bruce Almighty. Others {{considered for the}} role include Michael Keaton and Christopher Walken. Although Cook had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> proponent of adapting Disney's rides into films, the box office failure of The Country Bears (2002) made Michael Eisner attempt to shut down production of Pirates of the Caribbean. However, Verbinski told his concept artists to keep working on the picture, and when Eisner came to visit, the executive was astonished by what had been created.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-French {{businessman}} James Goldsmith {{announced the}} formation of the Referendum Party on 27 November 1994. Goldsmith had once <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> supporter of the EEC but had grown disenchanted with it during the early 1990s, becoming particularly concerned that it was forming into a superstate governed by centralised institutions in Brussels. He opposed the Maastricht Treaty, believing that it resulted in increased German dominance in Europe. As an economic protectionist, he was also critical of the EU's signing of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, believing that global free trade would damage both the EU's economy and his own business interests.|$|E

In this paper, {{this problem is}} answered. The main conclusion is that if X <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> Σ*-space and every point of X <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Gδ-set of X, then X <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> Σ-space. <b>As</b> a corollary, we have that a T 2 -space <b>is</b> <b>a</b> σ-space iff it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Σ*-space with a Gδ-diagonal.

5|$|The top 10 selling {{states during}} the first quarter of 2012 were California, Michigan, Florida, Illinois, Texas, New York, Minnesota, Ohio, North Carolina and Maryland. California is the leading market and {{accounted}} for almost 23% of Volt sales during this quarter, followed by Michigan with 6.3% of national sales. In California the leading regional markets are San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, all metropolitan areas notorious for their high congestion levels and where free access to high-occupancy lanes for solo drivers has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> incentive to boost Volt sales in the state.|$|E
5|$|This {{season ends}} on a cliffhanger {{due to the}} Writers' Strike. The show's head writer and {{executive}} producer, Jason Katims, stated that this last episode was “not in any way viewed as the season finale... If we were leading {{to the end of}} the season , we would have most likely brought the story around to the coach and his family again,” and there would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> football element as well, Katims said. Seven of the 22 episodes NBC ordered for Season 2 weren’t made.|$|E
5|$|Doubt {{about the}} {{possibility}} of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove René Descartes, and most other philosophers along with him, to dualism: the belief that the mind is to some degree independent of the brain. There has always, however, <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> argument in the opposite direction. There is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of, or injuries to, the brain (for example by drugs or by lesions, respectively) can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways. In the 19th century, the case of Phineas Gage, a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain, convinced both researchers and the public that cognitive functions were localised in the brain. Following this line of thinking, a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists, believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of, or reducible to, physical phenomena.|$|E

5|$|Edgar had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> ruler who {{had forced}} monastic reforms on a {{probably}} unwilling church and nobility, {{aided by the}} leading clerics of the day, Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury; Oswald of Worcester, Archbishop of York; and Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester. By endowing the reformed Benedictine monasteries with the lands required for their support, he had dispossessed many lesser nobles, and had rewritten leases and loans of land {{to the benefit of}} the monasteries. Secular clergy, many of whom would have been members of the nobility, had been expelled from the new monasteries. While Edgar lived, he strongly supported the reformers, but following his death, the discontents which these changes had provoked came into the open.|$|E
5|$|Local {{influences}} {{have also}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> part of Scouting. By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting {{has been able}} to find acceptance {{in a wide variety of}} cultures. In the United States, Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. frontier experience. This includes not only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts, but the underlying assumption that American native peoples are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from the Indian subcontinent, because that region was a significant focus in the early years of Scouting. Baden-Powell's personal experiences in India led him to adopt Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as a major influence for the Cub Scouts; for example, the name used for the Cub Scout leader, Akela (whose name was also appropriated for the Webelos), is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book.|$|E
5|$|On August12, a {{tropical}} disturbance entered the Caribbean Sea {{to the south}} of Antigua, believed to have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> tropical wave. Moving westward, it developed into {{a tropical}} storm by August15, based on ship observations in the region. That day, it passed {{to the south of}} Jamaica and later turned to the northwest. Due to the ongoing War of 1812, there was a British blockade of American ships, which caused a lack of observations in the region. As a result, the storm's track was uncertain, although it is believed that the system entered the Gulf of Mexico by August18; that day, a ship reported hurricane-force winds. After moving northward, the hurricane turned to the northwest off the coast of Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|Prison officials, {{fed up with}} Stroud's {{activities}} and their attendant publicity, intensified their efforts to transfer him out of Leavenworth. Stroud, however, discovered a Kansas law that forbade the transfer of prisoners married in Kansas. To this end, he married Jones by proxy, which infuriated the prison's administrators, who would not allow him to correspond with his wife. Prison officials {{were not the only}} ones perturbed with Stroud's marriage; his mother was also incensed. They had a close relationship, but Elizabeth Stroud strongly disapproved of the marriage to Jones, believing women were nothing but trouble for her son. Whereas previously she had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> advocate for her son, helping him with legal battles, she now argued against his application for parole, and became a major obstacle in his attempts to be released from the prison system. She moved away from Leavenworth and refused any further contact with him until her death in 1937.|$|E
5|$|The black meat of a Silkie is {{generally}} considered an unusual attribute in European and American cuisines. In contrast, several Asian cuisines consider Silkie meat a gourmet food. Chinese cuisine especially values the breed, {{but it is also}} a common ingredient in some Japanese, Cambodian, Vietnamese and Korean dishes. Areas where Chinese cuisine has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> influence, such as Malaysia, may also cook Silkie. As early as the 7th century, traditional Chinese medicine has held that chicken soup made with Silkie meat is a curative food. The usual methods of cooking include using Silkie to make broth, braising, and in curries. Traditional Chinese soup made with Silkie also uses ingredients such as wolfberries, Dioscorea polystachya (mountain yam), orange peel, and fresh ginger. A few fusion restaurants in metropolitan areas of the West have also cooked it as a part of traditional American or French cuisine, such as in confit.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Roberts has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> {{proponent of}} raising the image of {{motorcycle}} racing among the general public. During his riding career, he {{made a point of}} returning to the United States during the mid-season break in the Grand Prix calendar to race in the Laguna Seca 200 as a way to increase the profile of the event in order for it to gain Grand Prix status. The race eventually attained Grand Prix status in 1988 and in 1993, Roberts took on the role of promoter, providing financial backing for the 1993 United States Grand Prix. In the 1990s when Grand Prix racing faced diminishing numbers of competitors due to increasing costs, Roberts demanded that Yamaha provide engines to privateer teams in order to bolster the number of racers.|$|E

5|$|Without {{the support}} of the Communists, the {{increasingly}} unpopular and destructive Confrontation quickly came to an end. Secret talks between Malaysia and Indonesia were held throughout late 1965 and early 1966, and a peace treaty was signed in August of the latter year. Sukarno was toppled from power by the generals on accusations of collaborating with the rebels and replaced by Suharto as President on 12 March of the following year. The conflict had been an unqualified success for Britain and the West, as she had subdued a rising Communist power in Asia and prevented the 'domino effect' from taking off. And from a purely tactical standpoint, it had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> performance from British troops and commanders, as they had managed to confine a brewing disaster on a Vietnamese scale to a relatively small bush war that had a relatively small human cost and stabilised a potentially dangerous political situation of South East Asia.|$|E
