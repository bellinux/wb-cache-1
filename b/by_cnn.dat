5|$|In polling, Dodd {{has seemed}} unable {{to break through}} to the top tier. In Nationwide polls he usually only polls at or around 1%. A November 7, 2007 Gallup poll placed him in last place, behind both Joe Biden and Dennis Kucinich at 1%. At the state level, Dodd has also not done so well. In a November 18, 2007 Iowa poll {{conducted}} by ABC news, he registered with 1% the same number from a similar poll done by ABC news on July 31, 2007. In New Hampshire, a poll conducted <b>by</b> <b>CNN</b> placed Dodd at 1% constant from a September poll but up from polls in June and July. However, on the straw poll level, Dodd was able to gain a victory during an event in South Carolina on March 5, 2007. He won the York County straw poll by receiving 28% of the 100 votes cast. Barack Obama came in second with 24%. Hillary Clinton got 18% and John Edwards received 11%. The victory came two days after Dodd visited the county which probably secured him the win.|$|E

30|$|However, when we {{actually}} use these features generated <b>by</b> <b>CNNs</b> layers {{in a practical}} environment, two challenges appear. Firstly, the adjacent images in the dataset of LCD might have more resemblance than the images that really form the loop closure, so the algorithm tends to identify the adjacent images as loop closure, which is certainly not preferred. Secondly, the feature matching is computationally intensive because the dimension of features generated <b>by</b> <b>CNNs</b> may be very large, and LCD may have to compare the current image to {{a large amount of}} pre-captured images in order to decide whether the robot returns to previously visited positions. This can not satisfy strong request for real-time performance in robotic applications.|$|R
