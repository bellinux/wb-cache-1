40|$|This report {{describes}} a novel means of closing and sealing small type B radioactive material transport packages for surface or air transport as governed by 10 CFR 71 or NUREG- 0360 {{has been developed}} at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL). This method is a controlled brazing process {{that may be used}} to attach and seal a closure lid to a containment vessel and then remove it at a later time. The process may be performed multiple times without the need for special preparations of the braze joint. A number of advantages for utilization of this technique have been determined. A <b>brazed</b> <b>seal</b> has integrity at high temperatures for better protection in accident or abnormal environments. A properly designed joint has essentially the same strength as the parent metal. A closure that is brazed, therefore, will no longer be the anticipated point of failure for a broad range of accident environments. This technique will allow the containment vessel design to be optimized with a lighter, more uniform wall thickness throughout. Finally, with a well defined process for sealing, mechanical inspection, leak testing, and then reopening at a later time, automation of the process is relatively straightforward and the overall system should be as easy to use as one that utilizes elastomeric seals for containment...|$|E
40|$|Electrodes, current collectors, ceramic to metal <b>braze</b> <b>seals,</b> and {{metallic}} components {{exposed to}} the high 'hot side' temperatures and sodium liquid and vapor environment have been tested and evaluated in laboratory cells running for hundreds of hours at 1100 - 1200 K. Rhodium/tungsten electrodes have been selected as the optimum electrodes based on performance parameters and durability. Current collectors have been evaluated under simulated and actual operating conditions. The microscopic effects of metal migration between electrode and current collector alloys {{as well as their}} thermal and electrical properties determined the suitability of current collector and lead materials. <b>Braze</b> <b>seals</b> suitable for long term application to AMTEC devices are being developed...|$|R
40|$|Alkali metal {{thermoelectric}} converter operation in a recirculating test cell (RTC), {{which requires a}} small electromagnetic pump (EM) and a high-temperature beta-double-prime alumina-solid-electrolyte (BASE) -to-metal seal, is discussed. The design of a pump and an active metal <b>braze</b> <b>seal</b> and the initial operation of a cell using these components are described. The pump delivered 0. 25 cu cm/min against a 28 -psia head. A <b>braze</b> <b>seal</b> system was selected after shear strength tests of Ta or Nb brazed to BASE {{by a variety of}} fillers including TiCuNi, TiNi, and TiNiCr. The TiCuNi filler was chosen for environment cell testing and showed no failure or observable degradation after short-term tests up to 1055 K. The pump and the Nb/TiCuNi/BASE seal were used in a test that demonstrated all the operational functions of the RTC for the first time. An increase in the radiation reduction factor at constant input power was observed, indicating that the condenser was being wet by sodium resulting in an increased reflectivity...|$|R

A hydrogen-atmosphere, induction-heated brazing furnace was constructed to simultaneously braze 20 - 26 separate sensor leads at one time. The <b>brazed</b> <b>seals</b> were leak-tight, and the sheath wall {{has less than}} 10 percent interaction with the braze alloy. (auth...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} integrity of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) {{and the long-term}} stability underoperating conditions are basic requirements for a reliable operation of SOFC stacks. In this respect the use of metallic <b>brazes</b> as <b>sealing</b> material is considered to have advantages incomparison to the widely used brittle glasses or glass ceramics. In this study the mechanical properties of reactive air brazed YSZ-steel joints and their long-term stability at high temperatures in air and dual atmospheres are investigated. Silver-based braze compositions like Ag- 4 CuO are used for reactive air brazing of gas tightness samples. During aging in air at 850 °C for 800 h {{the thickness of the}} interfacial oxide layers increases with time, while the bending strength decreases. Microstructural analysis reveals the formation of voids within the brazing zone and the development of multilayered reactionlayers. In contrast, the aging in dual atmospheres at 850 °C causes strong degradation andthe total loss of gas tightness. However, the addition of small amounts of TiH 2 to the brazecompositions enhances the dual atmosphere tolerance of the reactive air <b>brazed</b> <b>seals...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} to return Martian samples to Earth for extensive analysis is in great {{interest of the}} planetary science community. It is important {{to make sure the}} mission would securely contain any microbes that may possibly exist on Mars so {{that they would not be}} able to cause any adverse effects on Earth's environment. A <b>brazing</b> <b>sealing</b> and sterilizing technique has been proposed to break the Mars-to-Earth contamination chain. Thermal analysis of the brazing process was conducted for several conceptual designs that apply the technique. Control of the increase of the temperature of the Martian samples is a challenge. The temperature profiles of the Martian samples being sealed in the container were predicted by finite element thermal models. The results show that the sealing and sterilization process can be controlled such that the samples' temperature is maintained below the potentially required level, and that the brazing technique is a feasible approach to break the contamination chain...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{compression}} {{tests were}} performed on gasket test specimens machined to the cross-sectional dimensions of a stainless steel (Type 304) ring type gasket to be installed in the SM- 1 reactor pressure vessel. Testing the mechanical properties of the gasket specimens under varying loads, and subsequent sectioning and inspection of specimens for adequacy of welded and brazed joints, gave the following results: (1) a penetration scheme involving five 0. 070 -in. diam. holes, spaced 1 / 4 in. center-to-center for each 6 1 / 2 in. belt circle span, may be made in a gasket ring without materially increasing the gasket stresses, (2) a lug may be welded to the gasket face to provide a <b>brazed</b> <b>sealing</b> support for 0. 0625 -in. diam. tubes and thermocouples, and (3) excellent attachments {{can be made by}} tungsten-inert gas welding of the lug to the gasket face and induction brazing of the tubes and thermocouples to the lug using Nicrobraz alloy.

40|$|AbstractA dense cermet {{membrane}} {{consisting of}} tantalum metal and yttria-stabilized zirconia {{has been developed}} for separation of hydrogen from hydrogen containing gas mixtures. Ta/YSZ membrane without secondary phase {{can be obtained by}} mechanical polishing after high vacuum sintering. As-prepared membrane showed dense structure with continuous channel of tantalum. Hydrogen permeation experiments were conducted using different cell to investigate the optimum sealing method. Hydrogen fluxes through these cermet membranes were measured in the region of 350 – 500  °C. The permeation flux increased monotonically with increasing the temperature. The highest hydrogen flux was 1. 2  ml/min⋅cm 2 for a cermet membrane of 0. 5  mm cm thick at 300 °C using 100 % H 2 as the feed gas and Ar as the sweep gas. Ta/YSZ membrane was deteriorated by tantalum hydride formed during permeation with <b>brazing</b> <b>sealing</b> {{but in the case of}} knife edge type sealing, no tantalum hydride was detected on the surface of Ta/YSZ cermet membrane...|$|R
40|$|A hot {{gas turbine}} engine {{capacitive}} probe clearanceometer is employed to measure the clearance gap or distance between blade tips on a rotor wheel and its confining casing under operating conditions. A <b>braze</b> <b>sealed</b> tip of the probe carries a capacitor electrode which is electrically connected to an electrical inductor within the probe which is inserted into a turbine casing to position its electrode at the inner surface of the casing. Electrical power is supplied through a voltage controlled variable frequency oscillator having a tuned circuit in which the probe is a component. The oscillator signal is modulated by a change in electrical capacitance between the probe electrode and a passing blade tip surface while an automatic feedback correction circuit corrects oscillator signal drift. A change in distance between a blade tip and the probe electrode {{is a change in}} capacitance therebetween which frequency modulates the oscillator signal. The modulated oscillator signal which is then processed through a phase detector and related circuitry to provide an electrical signal is proportional to the clearance gap...|$|R

40|$|A special double-wall {{container}} and {{a process for}} utilizing the container are being developed to enable (1) acquisition of a sample of material in a dirty environment that may include a biological and/or chemical hazard; (2) sealing a lid onto the inner part of the container to hermetically enclose the sample; (3) separating the resulting hermetic container from the dirty environment; and (4) bringing that hermetic container, without any biological or chemical contamination of its outer surface, into a clean environment. The process is denoted S(exp 3) B (separation, seaming, and <b>sealing</b> using <b>brazing)</b> because <b>sealing</b> of the sample into the hermetic container, separating the container from the dirty environment, and bringing the container with a clean outer surface into the clean environment are all accomplished simultaneously with a brazing operation...|$|R
50|$|Because {{the spark}} plug also seals the {{combustion}} chamber or the engine when installed, seals {{are required to}} ensure there is no leakage from the combustion chamber. The internal seals of modern plugs are made of compressed glass/metal powder, but old style seals were typically made {{by the use of}} a multi-layer <b>braze.</b> The external <b>seal</b> is usually a crush washer, but some manufacturers use the cheaper method of a taper interface and simple compression to attempt sealing.|$|R
40|$|The NSC 800 is an 8 -bit CMOS {{microprocessor}} {{manufactured by}} National Semiconductor Corp., Santa Clara, California. The 8 -bit microprocessor chip with 40 -pad pin-terminals has eight address buffers (A 8 -A 15), eight data address [...] I/O buffers (AD(sub 0) -AD(sub 7)), six interrupt controls and sixteen timing controls with a chip clock generator and an 8 -bit dynamic RAM refresh circuit.

40|$|One of the {{critical}} challenges facing planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology {{is the need for}} reliable sealing technology. Seals must exhibit long-term stability and mechanical integrity in the high temperature SOFC environment during normal and transient operation. Several different approaches for sealing SOFC stacks are under development, including glass or glass-ceramic <b>seals,</b> metallic <b>brazes,</b> and compressive <b>seals.</b> Among glass seals, rigid glass-ceramics, self-healing glass, and composite glass approaches have been investigated under the SECA Core Technology Program. The U. S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has developed the refractory glass approach {{in light of the fact}} that higher sealing temperatures (e. g., 930 - 1000 degrees C) may enhance the ultimate in-service bulk strength and electrical conductivity of contact materials, as well as the bonding strength between contact materials and adjacent SOFC components, such as interconnect coatings and electrodes. This report summarizes the thermal, chemical, mechanical, and electrical properties of the refractory sealing glass...|$|R
50|$|While most {{tanks are}} manufactured, some fuel tanks are still {{fabricated}} by metal craftsmen or hand-made {{in the case}} of bladder-style tanks. These include custom and restoration tanks for automotive,aircraft, motorcycles, and even tractors. Construction of fuel tanks follows a series of specific steps. The craftsman generally creates a mockup to determine the accurate size and shape of the tank, usually out of foam board. Next, design issues that affect the structure of the tank areaddressed - such as where the outlet, drain, fluid level indicator, seams, and baffles go. Then the craftsmen must determine the thickness, temper and alloy of the sheet he will use to make the tank. After the sheet is cut to the shapes needed, various pieces are bent to create the basic shell and/or ends and baffles for the tank. Many fuel tanks' baffles (particularly in aircraft and racecars) contain lightening holes. These flanged holes serve two purposes, they reduce the weight of the tank while adding strength to the baffles. Toward the end of construction, openings are added for the filler neck, fuel pickup, drain, and fuel-level sending unit. Sometimes these holes are created on the flat shell, other times they are added {{at the end of the}} fabrication process. Baffles and ends can be riveted into place. The heads of the rivets are frequently brazed or soldered to prevent tank leaks. Ends can then be hemmed in and soldered, or flanged and <b>brazed</b> (and/or <b>sealed</b> with an epoxy-type sealant) or the ends can be flanged and then welded. Once the soldering, brazing or welding is complete, the fuel tank is leak-tested.|$|R
40|$|EPCO Products {{manufactures}} banjo fittings for use {{in systems}} such as automobile brakes, heating and cooling, and robotics, among many others. Each banjo fitting consists of two cylindrical components joined by brazing. However, the brazing is subcontracted to another company that does not guarantee their work. EPCO wishes to guarantee their products as zero leak, but cannot do this unless each unit is tested to ensure the <b>brazing</b> has properly <b>sealed</b> the two components together. Due to this, EPCO {{is in need of}} a device that will test each fitting for leaks in the brazing before they leave the facility for use. The testing device {{needs to be able to}} adapt to all the various sizes and types of banjo fittings that EPCO manufactures. The device must pressurize each banjo fitting using the line pressure provided at their facility and be quick and easy to operate.
