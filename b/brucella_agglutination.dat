40|$|Introduction: Brucellozis {{is still}} a common {{infectious}} disease in our country and sometimes it may be presented with uncommon clinical manifestations. Case 1 : A ten years old male was presented to our clinic with complaints of malaise, weight loss, petechia, and bleeding of gums. On physical examination cervical lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly had been detected and in complete blood count pancytopenia was found. admitted to our clinic. In bone marrow aspiration hypocellular bone marrow was seen. His <b>Brucella</b> <b>agglutination</b> test was positive at 1 : 1280 titer and the blood culture was positive for Brucella mellitensis. The pancytopenia was resolved after the antibiotherapy. Case 2 : A nine-year-old female was referred to our clinic with tachycardia, who had the cardiac rate of 136 /min. The electrocardiography showed sinusal tachycardia and echocardiography was normal, no endocarditis or pericarditis was present. She had complaints of fatigue and lassitude for the last month. Her <b>brucella</b> <b>agglutination</b> test was positive at 1 : 1280 titer and blood culture was negative. After antibiotherapy her symptoms regressed, cardiac rate decreased to 80 - 100 /min.

Brucellosis was diagnosed by positive <b>Brucella</b> Standard <b>Agglutination</b> Test (and # 61619; 1 / 160 titer) and/or growth of Brucella spp. in blood culture in addition to the presence of clinical signs and findings. Diagnosis of osteoarticular system complications was established by physical examination and radiological findings obtained by diagnostic imaging tools. Magnetic resonance images of the thoracic, lumbar or sacral vertebrae were acquired in patients with back pain, low back pain and sacro-iliac joint pain. Results: Osteoarticular involvement was noted in 129 patients (40. 8 %) (females: 52 % and males: 48 %). The most common route of transmission was employment in farming and/or consumption of un-pasteurized milk or dairy products, especially fresh cheese, in 97 (75 %) cases. Mean age was 46 and # 61617; 18 years. Sacroiliitis was the most frequent osteoarticular involvement (n: 68, 52. 7 %), 70. 5 % of which were bilateral. Sacroiliitis was followed by spondylodiscitis in 35 (38. 7 %), peripheral arthritis in 20 (15. 5 %), bursitis in 1 (0. 8 %) cases. Patients with osteoarticular involvement received medical treatment for at least three months. Discussion: Ratio and anatomical region of osteoarticular involvement in brucellosis shows variability among areas. In the present study, we demonstrated that sacroiliitis was the most common form in Konya city. This disease should be included in differential diagnosis in patients with symptoms of sacroiliitis, spondylodiscitis or those with articular pain.

40|$|Objective: Brucellosis {{is still}} an {{important}} infectious disease, being widespread as endemic and sporadic cases in Turkey. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate clinical and laboratory findings, treatment modalities and final outcomes of brucellosis in children. Material and Methods: This is a retrospective record review of all patients 0 - 18 years of age with brucellosis admitted during a 8 -year period between January 2003 and September 2010. Results: Of the 62 patients, 39 (63 %) were male. The mean age and standard deviation of patients was 120 ± 51. 7 months (4 months- 18 years). Most common symptoms on admission were fever (88 %), arthralgia (64 %) and dizziness (19 %). On physical examination, the findings and percentages were as follows; arthritis (29 %), lymphadenopathy (25 %), hepatomegaly (24 %) and splenomegaly (17 %). Fifty-one percent of the patients had high sedimentation rate, 41 % had high transaminase levels, and 40 % had positivity for C-Reactive Protein. <b>Brucella</b> <b>agglutination</b> tests were positive in all cases. Brucella spp. was isolated from blood cultures in 27 % of the cases. All of the cases were given combined drug therapy. Three of the cases (4. 8 %) had relapses during the follow up period. No mortality was seen in patients with brucellosis. Conclusion: Childhood brucellosis remains an important public health problem in our country. It may cause serious complications in children, and treatment with at least two antibiotics for not less than six weeks appears to be effective...|$|E
40|$|Background: Brucellosis is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} zoonotic disease. There are reports regarding the brucellosis infection in family members sharing the same risk factors. This {{study was designed to}} screen the prevalence of brucellosis among the family members of cases with acute brucellosis. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on family members of 95 acute brucellosis cases (n= 239) hospitalized in Kashan Beheshti Hospital during 2013 - 2014. After taking the informed consent, the blood samples (5 cc) were taken from family members and the <b>brucella</b> <b>agglutination</b> test was done. The least titration value of 1 : 80 and 1 : 40 for positive Wright, Coombs Wright and 2 ME tests were considered, respectively. A questionnaire containing information about the demographic and past history, signs, and laboratory results of both patients and their family members were completed through interviewing. Results: Ninety-five and 81 out of 239 family members were considered as brucella affected and seropositive, respectively. The highest risk factor for transmission was the consumption of contaminated dairy, especially fresh cheese. The rate of seropositivity among the family members was 33. 9. Despite the significant correlation between dairy consumption and seropsitvity (P< 0. 01), there was no statistical association between sex, age, job, residency and animal contact with number of seropositive cases among family members. Conclusion: Considering the high rate of seropositivity among family members of brucellosis cases and consumption of fresh cheese as the most common risk factor for transmission, screening the family members and public education to avoid the consumption of unpasteurized dairy is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Background: Human brucellosis, a {{multi-organ}} system disease {{which may}} mimic other conditions, {{has a low}} incidence in childhood and the diagnosis may be easily missed. Brucellosis {{has become a major}} medical problem in some provinces of Iran. This study aimed to examine the epidemiology, clinical, and laboratory features, and treatment outcome of Brucellosis. Materials and Methods: We retrieved and reviewed the records charts of all patients admitted to pediatric infectious diseases, Ghods Hospital from March 1995 to March 2004 with a clinical diagnosis of brucellosis whose <b>brucella</b> <b>agglutination</b> titer was 1 : 160 or greater in department. Information on age, gender, history of using unpasteurized milk or milk products, presenting symptoms and physical signs were extracted from the patients ’ files. We also noted the result of routine laboratory tests, treatment given and outcome of treatment. Results: Children under 12 years constituted the total brucellosis admissions. One hundred and seventy-five patients (107 males, 68 females with a M/F ratio of 1. 6 : 1) had a diagnostic label of brucellosis and a brucella titer of 1 : 160. Eighty-seven patients (50 %) were 1 - 6 years old, 86 (49 %) were 7 - 12, while 2 patients were under 1. One hundred (57 %) patients were from rural areas and 75 (43 %) from cities. The admission for the disease was in summer in 76 patients (43 %), followed by spring in 52 (30 %), winter in 24 (14 %) and autumn (13 %). One hundred and fourteen (65 %) had history of using unpasteurized milk or milk products. The most frequent symptoms were arthralgia (79 %) and fever (78 %). The most commo...|$|E
40|$|Clinical human {{brucellosis}} {{is quite}} rare in Malaysia although seroconverters are relatively more. This report describes {{a case of}} clinical human brucellosis in Malaysia. This case involved a 29 -year-old research assistant in a veterinary microbiology laboratory. She complained of intermittent fever, anorexia, profuse sweating, malaise, headache, normotensive (110 / 60 mm Hg), muscle pain, and arthralgia for 3 d. Blood tests against dengue and malaria were negative thus she was prescribed vitamin C, paracetamol and cough syrup for common flu. The complaints, however, persisted {{on and off for}} the next 1 month. She eventually developed anemia and hypotension (90 / 50 mm Hg) and started to show reduced body weight. Abdominal palpations revealed hepatomegaly and splenomegaly with pain. Thus, brucellosis was suspected before the Rose-Bengal plate test was performed, which revealed the presence of high level of antibody against Brucella. The same test was repeated after 14 d and the results confirmed the presence of high antibody level against <b>Brucella.</b> Following serum <b>agglutination</b> test, a diagnosis of brucellosis was made and she was eventually prescribed rifampicine p. o. once a day combined with doxycycline p. o. twice a day for 6 consecutive weeks before she made a full recovery...|$|R
40|$|Brucellosis is {{widespread}} among humans and animals. Diagnosis of brucellosis mostly depends on serological methods. Serological tests are preferred over time-consuming and hazardous bacterial cultures in routine laboratory practice. However, these tests are somehow challenging due to ‘incomplete/blocking antibodies’ that prevent <b>agglutination.</b> <b>Brucella</b> Coombs gel test (BCGT) is newly developed test that contains Coombs antibodies (anti-human IgG) in gel microtubes and depends on gel centrifugation methods for the serological diagnosis of brucellosis. Here, {{performance of the}} BCGT is compared with standard serum tube agglutination (STA), standard serum tube agglutination with Coombs (C-STA) and immune capture agglutination (Brucellacapt). In total, 78 positive samples for study group and 16 samples {{for the control group}} were enrolled in the study. The samples were tested at dilutions of 1 : 40 – 1 : 5120. Titres at 1 : 160 and above were considered positive for brucellosis, whereas those lower than 1 : 160 were considered negative. Excellent agreement levels were determined between BCGT test and C-STA (κ, 0. 894; p < 0. 001), and BCGT and Brucellacapt (κ, 0. 802; p < 0. 001), when the diagnostic titre was accepted as 1 : 160. BCGT is easy to apply and interpret and provides reliable titre results in less than 2 h. It is also advantageous for screening...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBrucellosis is a {{systemic}} infection involving many organs and tissues. The musculoskeletal system {{is one of}} the most commonly affected. The disease can present with sacroiliitis, peripheral arthritis, spondylitis, paraspinal abscess, bursitis, and osteomyelitis. A 25 -year-old male patient was admitted with fever of 20 -day duration, right-sided hip pain, and night sweating. A <b>Brucella</b> standard tube <b>agglutination</b> test was positive at a titer of 1 / 160. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hip joint showed right sacroiliitis and a hyperintense, nodular, lobulated mass within the right iliacus muscle, consistent with abscess. The patient was started on intramuscular streptomycin at a dose of 1 g/day, oral rifampin 600 mg/day, and doxycycline 200 mg/day. On day 20 of treatment, the patient was admitted with swelling and pain over the left elbow for the past week. MRI of the left elbow was performed, which showed fluid edema suggestive of olecranon bursitis. Taking the patient's complaints into consideration, rifampin and doxycycline treatment were maintained for a year. Pain at the hip joint and elbow resolved and MRI findings disappeared. Abscess of the iliacus muscle, which has not been reported before, and the olecranon bursitis that developed during treatment make this case worth presenting...|$|R
