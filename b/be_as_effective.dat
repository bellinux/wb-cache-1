40|$|NM 441 is a {{lipophilic}} prodrug {{of a new}} thiazeto-quinoline {{carboxylic acid}} derivative NM 394, {{and when it is}} administered orally it is readily absorbed and hydrolyzed to its parent compound. After oral administration of NM 441 at a dose of 20 mg/kg to dogs, the peak concentration of NM 394 in plasma was 2. 39 micrograms/ml, whereas it was 0. 63 micrograms/ml for NM 394 administered alone. The in vivo activity of NM 441 was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and enoxacin in mouse protection studies. NM 441 <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> ofloxacin and <b>was</b> twice <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> ciprofloxacin against systemic infection with Staphylococcus aureus. Against infections with streptococci, NM 441 was two to three times <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> ofloxacin and five times <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> ciprofloxacin. Against infection with Escherichia coli, NM 441 <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but against infections with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, NM 441 was two to four times <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. NM 441 was three to seven times <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> enoxacin in systemic infections. Against urinary tract infections with E. coli, NM 441 reduced the number of bacterial CFU per gram of kidney by 1 to 2 log 10 more and, with P. aeruginosa, by 1 to 6 log 10 more than did ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.

5|$|England {{maintained}} their newly confident approach, being on top {{for most of}} the fourth Test. Yardley's men scored 496 and achieved a first innings lead of 38, Yardley contributing two wickets. England increased their lead by 365 before Yardley declared. He kept the team batting for five minutes on the last day, allowing him to use the heavy roller to quicken the break-up of the pitch. Australia had to score 404 in 345 minutes, a target considered unlikely as such a large total had never been made to win a Test match. In addition, the pitch was difficult to bat on by now and the spinners could turn the ball sharply. However, England made several errors: Godfrey Evans, the England wicket-keeper had a bad day and missed some stumping chances; three catches were dropped by fielders, and England's only specialist spinner, Jim Laker, bowled poorly. Consequently, Yardley was forced to use Denis Compton's bowling. Compton was not a specialist bowler and although he caused problems for the batsmen, Bill Bowes believed the selectors were mistaken in expecting him to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> as a front line spinner. Yardley seemed unsure of the best course of action as Bradman and Arthur Morris added 301 runs for the second wicket; he resorted to using the very occasional leg spin of Hutton, who was hit for 30 runs in four overs, although Yardley himself dropped a catch from Hutton's bowling. The pitch conditions were unfavourable for the faster bowlers, but the ineffectiveness of the spinners forced Yardley to take the new ball. Australia won by seven wickets; the spectators were unhappy with the inadequate English bowling and the absence of a suitable bowler to exploit the pitch on the last day. Bowes later criticised Yardley for allowing Australia to score quickly enough to win; he believed that Yardley used Hutton's bowling to encourage the tourists to take risks against lesser bowling to keep up with required rate of scoring, but he miscalculated in using such bowling for too long. Wisden also stated that England should have won the match.|$|E

40|$|The {{activities}} of clarithromycin, sulfisoxazole, and rifabutin against three virulent strains of Mycobacterium avium complex isolated from patients with {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}} were evaluated in a model of intracellular infection. Human monocyte-derived macrophages were infected at day 6 of culture with M. avium complex. Intracellular bacteria were counted 60 min after inoculation. Extra- and intracellular bacteria were counted at days 4 and 7 after inoculation. The concentrations used were 4 micrograms of clarithromycin per ml (MICs for the three strains, 4, 4, and 4 micrograms/ml), 50 micrograms of sulfisoxazole per ml (MICs, 50, 25, and 25 micrograms/ml), and 0. 5 micrograms of rifabutin per ml (MICs, 2, 0. 5, and 0. 5 micrograms/ml). Compared with controls, clarithromycin and rifabutin slowed the intracellular replication of the three strains (at day 7 after inoculation, P was less than 0. 01 for the first strain and less than 0. 001 for the two others). Sulfisoxazole was ineffective against the three strains. Clarithromycin <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> rifabutin.
