The Neyman-Pearson Theorem defines a rule in which the <b>best</b> <b>critical</b> <b>region</b> is derived for testing a simple hypothesis. Sequential Analysis builds upon this theorem as another form of sampling within hypothesis tests, in which the number of samples is not predetermined before sampling. Abraham Wald's Sequential Probability Ratio Test, along with standard testing {{will be used to}} make conclusions about our original problem concerning the simple hypothesis test.

Proactive computersystem forensics is the design, construction and configuring of systems {{to make them}} most amenable to digital forensics analyses in the future. The primary goals of proactive computer-system forensics are system structuring and augmentation for automated data discovery, lead formation, and efficient data preservation. This paper proposes: (1) using the Neyman-Pearson Lemma to proactively build online forensics tests with the <b>best</b> possible <b>critical</b> <b>regions</b> for hypothesis testing, and (2) using classical stopping rules for sequential hypothesis testing to determine which users are deviating from standard usage behavior and should {{be the focus of}} more investigative resources.

40|$|Congenital {{diaphragmatic hernia}} (CDH) is a {{frequently}} occurring birth defect {{and a source}} of potentially fatal neonatal respiratory distress. Recently, through the application of detailed karyotyping methods, several CDH-critical regions within the human genome have been identified. These regions typically contain several genes. In this paper we focused on genes from 15 q 26, the <b>best</b> characterized CDH <b>critical</b> <b>region,</b> as well as FOG 2 and GATA 4 – genes singled out from CDH-critical regions at 8 q 22 -q 23 and 8 p 23. 1, respectively. We tested the hypothesis that these putative CDH-related genes are expressed within the developing diaphragm {{at the time of the}} hypothesized initial defect. Our results show that 15 q 26 contains a cluster of genes that are expressed in the developing rodent diaphragm, consistent with an association between deletions in this region and CDH. We then examined the protein expression pattern of positively identified genes within the developing diaphragm. Two major themes emerged. First, those factors strongly associated with CDH are only expressed in the non-muscular, mesenchymal component of the diaphragm, supporting the hypothesis that CDH has its origins in a mesenchymal defect. Second, these factors are all co-expressed in the sam...|$|R

40|$|The {{conventional}} Kibble-Zurek scaling {{describes the}} scaling {{behavior in the}} driven dynamics across a single <b>critical</b> <b>region.</b> In this paper, we study the driven dynamics across an overlapping <b>critical</b> <b>region,</b> in which a <b>critical</b> <b>region</b> (Region-A) is overlaid by another <b>critical</b> <b>region</b> (Region-B). We develop a hybridized Kibble-Zurek scaling (HKZS) to characterize the scaling behavior in the driven process. According to the HKZS, the driven dynamics in the overlapping region can be described by the critical theories for both Region-A and Region-B simultaneously. This results in a constraint on the scaling function in the overlapping <b>critical</b> <b>region.</b> We take the quantum Ising chain in an imaginary longitudinal-field as an example. In this model, the <b>critical</b> <b>region</b> of the Yang-Lee edge singularity and the <b>critical</b> <b>region</b> of the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition point overlap with each other.

40|$|Awarded the HKIE Transactions Prize 2005 Extent of <b>critical</b> <b>region,</b> {{which is}} usually {{referred}} to as plastic hinge length, of high-strength reinforced concrete (HSRC) columns, where extensive inelastic damages might occur under seismic loading, was experimentally investigated. A total of 6 HSRC columns that can be grouped into 2 series or 3 pairs, were tested under various axial load levels as well as reversed cyclic inelastic displacement excursions simulating seismic loading. The first series of columns contained transverse steel designed according to the shear resistance requirement of BS 8110, while the second series, representing limited ductile columns, to the authors' proposed equation. From test observation, progressive development and formation of the <b>critical</b> <b>region</b> in these columns were discussed. The extents of these <b>critical</b> <b>regions</b> were subsequently evaluated rigorously using direct (by physical observation or measured column curvature profiles) and indirect (by back calculation using an idealised column curvature profile) methods. From the results, it was evident that: (1) the <b>critical</b> <b>region</b> developed starting {{from the point of}} maximum bending moment over a finite length along the concrete spoiling area, (2) the extent of <b>critical</b> <b>region</b> was largely influenced by volumetric ratio of transverse steel, concrete strength and axial load level, (3) the extents of <b>critical</b> <b>region</b> evaluated using both methods were in good agreement, (4) the HSRC columns containing transverse steel calculated using the authors' proposed equation proved to behave in a limited ductile manner, and the extent of their <b>critical</b> <b>regions</b> was smaller than that of the counterpart columns designed complying with BS 8110. Finally, some guidelines for the design of limited ductile HSRC columns were proposed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel method and a tool calledSyncchar for understanding and modeling {{the performance of}} shared memory parallel programs. Syncchar helps programmers choose the type of synchronization they need and focuses their attention on which <b>critical</b> <b>regions</b> would benefit most from reorganization. Conservative synchronization (e. g., a spinlock) performs best for highly contended data structures, whereas optimistic synchronization (e. g., transactional memory or a sequence lock) performs best for lightly contended data structures. Syncchar usesdataindependence andconflictdensity to model the performance of parallel programs. A pair of <b>critical</b> <b>regions</b> are data independent if the memory written by one <b>critical</b> <b>region</b> (its write set) does not intersect the memory read or written by the other <b>critical</b> <b>region</b> (its address set). When <b>critical</b> <b>regions</b> are not data independent, conflict density measures {{the degree to which}} there is a single “problem ” thread that is conflicting with many other threads, or whether all conflicting threads conflict with each other. By sampling the address sets of a lock-based program, the Syncchar algorithm predicts the speedup of the program if it were converted to use optimistic concurrency. Syncchar also identifies contention hot-spots in critical sections, which helps focus programmer effort in the areas of greatest performance gains. The paper measures and validates the Syncchar model using several microbenchmarks, and provides a case study of performance tuning <b>critical</b> <b>regions</b> in the Linux kernel. The Syncchar tool uncovers opportunities to increase the performance of the Linux kernel by as much as 4. 8 % and the transactional Linux kernel (TxLinux) by up to 8 %. 1...|$|R
