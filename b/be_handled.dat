5|$|As {{a highly}} {{radioactive}} element, americium {{and its compounds}} must <b>be</b> <b>handled</b> only in an appropriate laboratory under special arrangements. Although most americium isotopes predominantly emit alpha particles which can be blocked by thin layers of common materials, many of the daughter products emit gamma-rays and neutrons which have a long penetration depth.|$|E
5|$|Aspect weavers take {{instructions}} {{known as}} advice specified {{through the use}} of pointcuts and join points, special segments of code that indicate what methods should <b>be</b> <b>handled</b> by aspect code. The implementation of the aspect then specifies whether the related code should be added before, after, or throughout the related methods. By doing this, aspect weavers improve modularity, keeping code in one place that would otherwise have been interspersed throughout various, unrelated classes.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the highly}} {{reactive}} nature of potassium metal, it must <b>be</b> <b>handled</b> with great care, with full skin and eye protection and preferably an explosion-resistant barrier between the user and the metal. Ingestion of large amounts of potassium compounds can lead to hyperkalemia strongly influencing the cardiovascular system. Potassium chloride {{is used in the}} United States for lethal injection executions.|$|E

5|$|Care {{needs to}} be taken when {{machining}} hafnium because it is pyrophoric—fine particles can spontaneously combust when exposed to air. Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but hafnium compounds should <b>be</b> <b>handled</b> as if they were toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds.|$|E
5|$|Elemental iodine {{is also a}} skin irritant, {{and direct}} contact with skin can cause damage and solid iodine {{crystals}} should <b>be</b> <b>handled</b> with care. Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration, such as tincture of iodine and Lugol's solution, are capable of causing tissue damage if used in prolonged cleaning or antisepsis; similarly, liquid Povidone-iodine (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns in some reported cases.|$|E
5|$|Elemental {{scandium}} {{is considered}} non-toxic, though extensive animal testing of scandium compounds {{has not been}} done. The median lethal dose (LD50) levels for scandium(III) chloride for rats have been determined as 4mg/kg for intraperitoneal and 755mg/kg for oral administration. In the light of these results, compounds of scandium should <b>be</b> <b>handled</b> as compounds of moderate toxicity.|$|E

5|$|In each case, these {{simplified}} models display many of {{the issues}} that have to <b>be</b> <b>handled</b> in practice. Constraint satisfaction problems, which generalize graph homomorphism problems, can express various additional types of conditions (such as individual preferences, or bounds on the number of coinciding assignments). This allows the models to be made more realistic and practical.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, dragonflies and damselflies are {{sought out}} as a hobby similar to birding and butterflying, known as oding, from the Latin name of the {{dragonfly}} order, Odonata. Oding is especially popular in Texas, where 225 different species of odonates have been observed. With care, and with dry fingers, dragonflies can <b>be</b> <b>handled</b> and released by oders, as {{can be done with}} butterflies, though it is not encouraged.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is toxic, an {{oxidizing}} agent, and is categorised as probably carcinogenic {{to humans}} by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Consequently, it must <b>be</b> <b>handled</b> and stored {{with the appropriate}} safety precautions to prevent inhalation, ingestion and skin contact. Due to its hazardous nature, the limited applications of lead(II) nitrate are under constant scrutiny.|$|E

5|$|Like other rare-earth metals, {{lutetium}} {{is regarded}} as having a low degree of toxicity, but its compounds should <b>be</b> <b>handled</b> with care nonetheless: for example, lutetium fluoride inhalation is dangerous and the compound irritates skin. Lutetium nitrate may be dangerous as it may explode and burn once heated. Lutetium oxide powder is toxic as well if inhaled or ingested.|$|E

5|$|Polonium and its {{compounds}} must <b>be</b> <b>handled</b> in a glove box, {{which is}} further enclosed in another box, maintained at a slightly higher pressure than the glove box to prevent the radioactive materials from leaking out. Gloves made of natural rubber do not provide sufficient protection against the radiation from polonium; surgical gloves are necessary. Neoprene gloves shield radiation from polonium better than natural rubber.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium and {{tellurium}} compounds {{are considered}} to be mildly toxic and need to <b>be</b> <b>handled</b> with care, although acute poisoning is rare. Tellurium poisoning is particularly difficult to treat as many chelation agents used in the treatment of metal poisoning will increase the toxicity of tellurium.
