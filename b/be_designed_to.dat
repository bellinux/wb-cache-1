5|$|One current {{difficulty}} in {{the ideas of}} Geniocracy is that the means of assessing intelligence are ill-defined.

5|$|Developments in AspectJ have {{revealed}} {{the potential to}} incorporate just-in-time compilation into the execution of aspect-oriented code to address performance demands. At run-time, an aspect weaver could translate aspects in a more efficient manner than traditional, static weaving approaches. Using AspectJ on a Java Virtual Machine, dynamic weaving of aspects at run-time {{has been shown to}} improve code performance by 26%. While some implementations of just-in-time virtual machines implement this capability through a new virtual machine, some implementations can <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> use features that already exist in current virtual machines. The requirement of a new virtual machine is contrary to one of the original design goals of AspectJ.|$|E
5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under {{the snow on}} the roof and {{freezing}} at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow.|$|E
5|$|Muscles and nerves {{that control}} the {{digestive}} process may be affected by PD, resulting in constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach {{for a longer period}} than normal). A balanced diet, based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended and should <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> avoid weight loss or gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction. As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) may appear. In such cases it may be helpful to use thickening agents for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating, both measures reducing the risk of choking. Gastrostomy to deliver food directly into the stomach is possible in severe cases.|$|E

5|$|The first LARPs {{were run}} in the late 1970s, {{inspired}} by tabletop role-playing games and genre fiction. The activity spread internationally during the 1980s and has diversified into {{a wide variety of}} styles. Play may be very game-like or may be more concerned with dramatic or artistic expression. Events can also <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> achieve educational or political goals. The fictional genres used vary greatly, from realistic modern or historical settings to fantastic or futuristic eras. Production values are sometimes minimal, but can involve elaborate venues and costumes. LARPs range in size from small private events lasting a few hours to large public events with thousands of players lasting for days.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} such motif is the double {{crossover}} (DX) complex, which contains two Holliday junctions {{in close proximity}} to each other, resulting in a rigid structure that can self-assemble into larger arrays. The structure of the DX molecule forces the Holliday junctions to adopt a conformation with the double-helical domains directly side-by-side, in contrast to their preferred angle of about 60°. The complex can <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> force the junctions into either a parallel or antiparallel orientation, but in practice the antiparallel variety are more well-behaved, and the parallel version is rarely used.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of habitats {{is a necessary}} step in the maintenance of biodiversity because if habitat destruction occurs, the animals and plants reliant on that habitat suffer. Many countries have enacted legislation to protect their wildlife. This may {{take the form of}} the setting up of national parks, forest reserves and wildlife reserves, or it may restrict the activities of humans with the objective of benefiting wildlife. The laws may <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> protect a particular species or group of species, or the legislation may prohibit such activities as the collecting of bird eggs, the hunting of animals or the removal of plants. A general law on the {{protection of}} habitats may be more difficult to implement than a site specific requirement. A concept introduced in the United States in 1973 involves protecting the critical habitat of endangered species, and a similar concept has been incorporated into some Australian legislation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the story}} group, monsters {{were the first}} thing designed. The monsters' names, skills, and personalities were decided first, after which they were drawn by artist Akira Toriyama. Yuji Horii allowed Toriyama to paint full {{drawings}} rather than directly create the pixel art that would be shown in the game. The artwork was then converted into computer graphics; as Toriyama was unfamiliar with computer graphics technology, other staff took charge of this. Many new monsters needed to <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> make the game feel real, and the process was laborious for Toriyama. But he has also said that, compared to the manga comics he was used to, he enjoyed painting more, so on balance the experience was positive. Yuji Horii stated that for his process, like other manga and film creators, he quickly outlines the story's plot in his mind. With regard to map design, a blank map was used to create the physical shape of the place, like a castle, cave, or tower, and then the key elements and story were created together afterwards. The scenarios were mainly written by his friend Hiroshi Miyaoka. Compared with write lines in writing paper and design map in graph paper, staff wrote both two in 5mm graph papers of A4, as they felt that's easy for organization; their manuscript thickness is 15cm.|$|E
