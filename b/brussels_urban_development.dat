40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{question}} whether {{and to what extent}} <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics make use of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts to tackle tasks and challenges posed by immigration and the presence of migrants in cities. As a start, relevant migration-related issues with a connection to <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> are expounded. This is followed by the analysis of six <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts in terms of any migration and integration – related statements they may contain. The thesis consists of three chapters: in the first chapter, “migration” as the given central topic is identified and discussed following an examination of up-to-date specialist literature. There is a strong emphasis on the terminology used in current debates with particular attention given to the term “integration“. Another aspect of the first chapter is immigration in Germany: since its foundation, the Federal Republic of Germany has been a destination for immigrants; as a result, there are presently 12 million people from migrant backgrounds living in Germany. Among the main destinations were large West German cities, and within these cities specific districts which have consequently become rife with migration-related issues and problems. As a result, there are complex social, economic and spatial developments and phenomena which all have an impact on <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics: Population development, segregation, the housing situation, the educational situation, their economic potential and chances, cultural impact of the presence of migrants. These aspects and the subject of integration and their relevance to <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> are the main topics of the professional debate. “Migration” with its complex spatial and content-related implications thus offers a cross- section view of <b>urban</b> <b>development.</b> The second chapter addresses the subject of “urban development”. A brief retrospective highlights the general framework and paradigms of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> since the 1960 s and, above all, the use and implementation of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts. The realisation here is that <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts do provide ideas and possibilities on how to handle migration-related issues and integrate these into <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics. Basic consideration of urban migration topics on one hand and <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics on the other hand have been the basis for developing a “migration evaluation” of selected current <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts. Using a uniform investigation raster, it is explored how and to what extent these <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts contain statements on the migration-related topics mentioned above. The concluding examination in the third chapter returns to the initial questions: Is migration an integral part of current <b>urban</b> <b>development?</b> If so, how and to what extent? This will then lead to questions of whether the full potential of migration-related possibilities is being tapped and the restrictions and boundaries that apply. The overall conclusion is that <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics has so far failed to fully realise the importance of “migration” as an issue. <b>Urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts have been used with reserve to implement this issue in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics in an explicit, constructive and stringent manner. There {{can be no doubt that}} this is a difficult task. The appropriate consideration of issues of migration and integration in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts is met with various challenges: the complexity of this task cannot be ignored. However, this should by no means affect the comprehensibility of the problem; the significance of migration issues within <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts and the real life impact of these issues on <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> should correspond; <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts should be closely linked with other (professional) conceptions in the context of migration and integration. Migrants should be involved in the process of creating <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts in order to tap their resources, knowledge and potential for <b>urban</b> <b>development.</b> Finally, the thesis identifies existing gaps and areas in need of further research: <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts give but little indication of actual activity in the respective migration-related communal arenas; also, <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts are the result and expression of ongoing local politics debates, yet a discrepancy remains between the political aims and stances identified in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts and those discussed outside the realm of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts. This discrepancy requires further analysis. A third gap has been identified between local politics objectives and actual local activity beyond political agendas. The thesis closes on the note that not only is there a need for migration to be recognised as an urban development-relevant matter but that there is ample reasoning for the integration of migration as a task in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> and the {{restoration}} of the urban infrastructures currently plays {{a significant role in the}} conurbation of Brussels. The first aim of the <b>Brussels</b> <b>Urban</b> Geology (BUG) program is the creation of a GIS application gathering and collecting all information on the geological underground of the Brussels region. The ultimate goal is to create a tool usable by the local authorities and the companies within the framework of regional planning within the territory of Brussels. Several databases have been created and will be illustrated in this paper: • The drill holes database is used to build up the 3 D geological model of the underground of Brussels. For all the boreholes, information is stored on the depth of the top and the thickness of each geological formation, the geographic coordinates, the type of the boreholes, etc. • The fillings database will serve to create contour maps of the made ground observed in the boreholes of the Brussels region. This is particularly important in the <b>urban</b> planning <b>development.</b> • The peat database identifies all the boreholes in which peat layers have been observed and aims to locate the zones where small ground movements could occur. The outputs from this layer inform about the thickness and the nature of peaty grounds and are thus particularly important in this context. Currently, more than 700 drill holes, from a total of around 5000 drill holes available in the archives of th...|$|R

40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>development</b> bestows a great {{opportunity}} to increase sustainability in the built environment as cities are responsible for the majority of environmental impacts. However, the <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> process is fragmented and sub-optimization leads to unsustainable life cycle outcomes.

40|$|In {{the global}} {{knowledge}} economy, knowledge-intensive industries and knowledge workers are extensively {{seen as the}} primary factors to improve the welfare and competitiveness of cities. To attract and retain such industries and workers, cities produce knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> strategies, and therefore such strategising has become an important development mechanism for cities and their economies. The paper discusses the critical connections between knowledge city foundations and integrated knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> mechanisms in both the local and regional level. In particular, the paper investigates Brisbane’s knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> strategies that support gentrification, attraction, and retention of investment and talent. Furthermore, the paper develops a knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> assessment framework to provide {{a clearer understanding of}} the local and regional policy frameworks, and relevant applications of Brisbane’s knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> experience, in becoming a prosperous knowledge city. The paper, with its knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> assessment framework, scrutinises Brisbane’s four development domains in detail: economy; society; institutional; built and natural environments. As part of the discussion of the case study findings, the paper describes the global orientation of Brisbane within the frame of regional and local level knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> strategies performing well. Although several good practices from Brisbane have already been internationally acknowledged, the research reveals that Brisbane is still {{in the early stages of}} its knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> implementation.
