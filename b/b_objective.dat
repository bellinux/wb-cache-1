40|$|An {{objective}} meteorological analysis {{technique is}} presented whereby both {{horizontal and vertical}} upper air analyses are performed. The process used to interpolate grid-point values from the upper-air station data {{is the same as}} for grid points on both an isobaric surface and a vertical cross-sectional plane. The nearby data surrounding each grid point are used in the interpolation by means of an anisotropic weighting scheme, which is described. The interpolation for a grid-point potential temperature is performed isobarically; whereas wind, mixing-ratio, and pressure height values are interpolated from data that lie on the isentropic surface that passes through the grid point. Two versions (A and B) of the technique are evaluated by qualitatively comparing computer analyses with subjective handdrawn analyses. The objective products of version A generally have fair correspondence with the subjective analyses and with the station data, and depicted the structure of the upper fronts, tropopauses, and jet streams fairly well. The version <b>B</b> <b>objective</b> products correspond more closely to the subjective analyses, and show the same strong gradients across the upper front with only minor smoothing...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to lay a {{foundation}} for the Anchorage Metro Area Transportation Solutions (AMATS) Freight Advisory Committee's (FAC) long-term vision of identifying the freight infrastructure projects in Anchorage.

40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed {{that there is a}} distinction between two kinds of representations of space and time. Perspectival or egocentric representations are viewpoint-dependent {{in the sense that the}} way spatial and temporal positions and relations are represented is relative to one’s own position in space or time. In contrast, objective representations are independent of one’s position in space or time and thus viewpoint-invariant. For instance, I may represent event A as past or as more past than event B (perspectival representations of temporal position and temporal relation, respectively) or I may represent event A as occurring on September 11, 2001 and as earlier then event <b>B</b> (<b>objective</b> representations of temporal location and temporal relation, respectively). And similarly for spatial positions and relations. One contentious issue, however, is whether perspectival and objective representations are independent or whether representations of one kind are constructed, at least in part, from representations of the other kind. One further issue is whether the analogy between space and time is strong enough that the answer given to the previous question in the case of space, say, should also hold for time, or vice-versa...|$|E
40|$|Usability is a core {{construct}} of website evaluation and inherently defined as interactive. Yet, when analysing first impressions of websites, expected usability, i. e., before use, is of interest. Here we investigate to what extend ratings of expected usability {{are related to}} (a) experienced usability, i. e., ratings after use, and (<b>b)</b> <b>objective</b> usability measures, i. e., task performance. Furthermore, we try to elucidate how ratings of expected usability are correlated to aesthetic judgments. In an experiment, 57 participants submitted expected usability ratings after the presentation of website screenshots in three viewing-time conditions (50, 500, and 10, 000 ms) and after an interactive task (experienced usability). Additionally, objective usability measures (task completion and duration) and subjective aesthetics evaluations were recorded for each website. The results at both the group and individual level show that expected usability ratings are not significantly related either to experienced usability or objective usability measures. Instead, they are highly correlated with aesthetics ratings. Taken together, our results highlight the need for interaction in empirical website usability testing, even when exploring very early usability impressions. In our study, user ratings of expected usability were no valid proxy neither for objective usability nor for experienced website usability...|$|E

The diagnosis may {{be made by the}} ultrasound examination (types II a-, II <b>b).</b> <b>Objective.</b> The aim of the authors was to define the congenital structural neonatal hip dysplasia, and to differentiate hip hypoplasia, hip dysplasia and teratogenic anomalies. Methods. In all the cases, the uniform clinical and ultrasound tests were performed. All the patients were examined in the neonatal period of life (the first six weeks). The following clinical tests were used: Le Damany-Ortolany, Coleman-Barlow-Palmen and Weissman-Strinović. For the ultrasound examination, the Graph’s method was used. Results. The investigation was performed in the period 2007 - 2008. 2, 878 neonates were included. The distribution of the sonotypes, according to Graph, was as follows: Ia in 16. 17 %. Ib in 65. 08 %; IIa+ in 18. 17 %, IIc in 0. 28 %, IId in 0. 19 %; IIIa in 0. 009 %, IIIb in 0. 02 %; and IV in 0. 01 %. It was found that DDH was 8 times more frequent in girls; located more frequently at the left side than bilaterally. Conclusion.

40|$|Background: Addition of {{clonidine}} to ropivacaine (0. 2 %) {{can potentially}} enhance analgesia without producing prolonged motor blockade. The {{aim of the}} present study was to compare the post-operative pain relieving quality of ropivacaine 0. 2 % and clonidine mixture to that of plain ropivacaine 0. 2 % following caudal administration in children. Methods: In a prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, 30 ASA 1 pediatric patients undergoing infraumbilical surgery were randomly allocated to receive a caudal injection of either plain ropivacaine 0. 2 % (1 ml/kg) (group A) or a mixture of ropivacaine 0. 2 % (1 ml/kg) with clonidine 2 μg/kg (group <b>B).</b> <b>Objective</b> pain score and need for supplemental analgesics were compared during the 1 st 24 hours postoperatively. Residual post-operative sedation and motor blockade were also assessed. Results: Significantly prolonged duration of post-operative analgesia was observed in group B (P< 0. 0001). Heart rate and blood pressure were not different in 2 groups. Neither motor blockade nor post-operative sedation varied significantly between the groups. Conclusion: The combination of clonidine (2 μg/kg) and ropivacaine 0. 2 % was associated with an improved quality of post-operative analgesia compared to plain 0. 2 % ropivacaine. The improved analgesic quality of the clonidine-ropivacaine mixture was achieved without causing any significant degree of post-operative sedation or prolongation of motor blockade...|$|E

Methods. Forty children with AR and twenty-five normal controls were included. The relationship between IL- 37 b and Th 1 / 2 cytokines production in serum and nasal lavage was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified for in vitro regulation experiment of IL- 37 b. Intranasal mometasone furoate was given in AR children and IL- 37 b change after one-month treatment was detected using ELISA. Results. We observed significantly decreased IL- 37 b expression levels in both serum and nasal lavage compared to controls. IL- 37 b was negatively correlated with Th 2 cytokines. Our results also showed that IL- 37 b downregulated Th 2 cytokine expressed by PBMCs and this modulation was through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) pathway. We also found that intranasal mometasone furoate therapy can promote nasal IL- 37 b expression. Conclusion.
