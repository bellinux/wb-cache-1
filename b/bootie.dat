5|$|Following {{the release}} of Labcabincalifornia, member Fatlip split from The Pharcyde, and the group did not return until 2000, {{releasing}} the album Plain Rap to mediocre reviews. Though the album marked the first collaboration between the group and J-Swift, <b>Bootie</b> Brown and Imani had a falling out with SlimKid (now known by his birth name Tre Hardson), before the album was released, turning the group into a duo. In 2004, Imani and <b>Bootie</b> released the group's fourth album, Humboldt Beginnings, receiving little attention and harsh reviews. Tre and Fatlip have both since released solo albums, but no project released by the group or its members since their debut {{has been able to}} reach the acclaim of Bizarre Ride.|$|E

Following the release, the group set out on the Lollapalooza tour, and waited almost three years to release their second album, Labcabincalifornia. While the album featured two highly regarded hit singles, [...] "Runnin'" [...] and [...] "Drop", it received mixed reviews.

2500|$|The size of {{a needle}} is {{described}} first by its diameter and secondly by its length. [...] The size of the new stitch is determined {{in large part by}} the diameter of the knitting needle used to form it, because that affects the length of the yarn-loop drawn through the previous stitch. [...] Thus, large stitches can be made with large needles, whereas fine knitting requires fine needles. In most cases, the knitting needles being used in hand-knitting are of the same diameter; however, in uneven knitting, needles of different sizes may be used. Larger stitches may also be made by wrapping the yarn more than once around the needles with every stitch. The length of a needle determines how many stitches it can hold at once; for example, very large projects such as a shawl with hundreds of stitches might require a longer needle than a small project such as a scarf or <b>bootie.</b> [...] Various sizing systems for needles are in common use.|$|E
