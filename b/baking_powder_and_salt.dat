60|$|Without more ado Glenn settled to brisk action, {{every move}} of which Carley watched with keen eyes. The usurping of a woman's {{province}} {{by a man}} was always an amusing thing. But for Glenn Kilbourne--what more would it be? He evidently knew what he wanted, for every movement was quick, decisive. One after another he placed bags, cans, sacks, pans, utensils on the table. Then he kicked at the roaring fire, settling some of the sticks. He strode outside to return with a bucket of water, a basin, towel, and soap. Then he took down two queer little iron pots with heavy lids. To each pot was attached a wire handle. He removed the lids, then set both the pots right on the fire or in it. Pouring water into the basin, he proceeded to wash his hands. Next he took a large pail, and from a sack he filled it half full of flour. To this he added <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> <b>and</b> <b>salt.</b> It was instructive for Carley to see him run his skillful fingers all through that flour, as if searching for lumps. After this he knelt before the fire and, lifting {{off one of the}} iron pots with a forked stick, he proceeded to wipe out the inside of the pot and grease it with a piece of fat. His next move was to rake out a pile of the red coals, a feat he performed with the stick, and upon these he placed the pot. Also he removed the other pot from the fire, leaving it, however, quite close.|$|E

50|$|According to General Mills, Bisquick {{was invented}} in 1930 after one of their top sales {{executives}} met an innovative train dining car chef on a business trip. After the sales executive complimented the chef on his deliciously fresh biscuits, the dining car chef shared that he used a pre-mixed biscuit batter he created consisting of lard, flour, <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> <b>and</b> <b>salt.</b> The chef then stored his pre-mixed biscuit batter on ice in his kitchen ahead of time, enabling him to bake fresh biscuits quickly on the train every day.

50|$|Bisquick is {{a baking}} mix brand that {{was founded by}} Carl Smith in 1931. At the time, Smith was {{employed}} a sales executive for the General Mills, Inc. Sperry Division.

However, unlike the Americans, the British also ran some round-trips, using their southeast corridor. On 6 July the Yorks and Dakotas were joined by Short Sunderland flying boats. Flying from Finkenwerder on the Elbe near Hamburg to the Havel river next to Gatow, their corrosion-resistant hulls suited them to the particular task of delivering <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> <b>and</b> other <b>salt</b> into the city.|$|R
5000|$|Nuegados is a {{traditional}} plate from many different countries in Latin America. However, {{it is only in}} [...] "El Salvador that they are called 'nuégados'" [...] (Latinaish, Salvadoran Nuegados) Nuegados are [...] "nothing more than fried dumplings coated with a sweet sugar cane sauce". To prepare nuegados, one deep fries a dough made of corn flour, <b>baking</b> <b>powder,</b> butter, <b>salt,</b> <b>and</b> water in oil. A cinnamon sugar syrup is then poured on top of the dumplings. They are often eaten with coffee.|$|R
50|$|Place the flour, <b>baking</b> <b>powder,</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> mace in {{a medium}} bowl. Stir with a wire whisk to combine. Set aside. In a large bowl of an {{electric}} mixer, cream together the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs and mix until creamy. Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well-combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll {{the dough into a}} 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat the oil in a deep-sided pot over medium heat to 375 °F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side for another 2 or 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining fastnachts.|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceFood ScienceFadi AramouniLittle in vivo {{research}} on glycemic index (GI) values or the digestive impact of sorghum based food products currently exists. Because sorghum is a gluten-free grain, its utilization in the United States is growing, especially in baking applications. Information on how sorghum affects {{blood sugar levels}} would be beneficial as new products emerge because glycemic effect {{has an impact on}} human health and in controlling diabetes. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the GI of a sorghum muffin, and compare this value to the GI of muffins made from commonly consumed grains in the United States. The effects of particle size and damaged starch on GI were also studied. GI values were determined for muffins made from white sorghum, corn, brown rice, whole wheat, and all-purpose flours. All muffin formulations were composed of flour, water, <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> <b>and</b> <b>salt.</b> To determine the GI, weighed portions of muffin containing 20 g of available carbohydrates were eaten on separate occasions by eight healthy volunteers (ages 18 - 40) after an overnight fast (10 hours). Each muffin was administered twice. Two capillary blood samples were taken at 0 (fasting), 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after consumption and averaged. Blood glucose curves were constructed from mean blood glucose values. The GI was calculated by dividing the incremental area under the curve for the test food (muffin) by that for the standard (20 g dextrose drink) and multiplying by 100. The GI for the muffins was calculated as the mean from the respective average GIs of the 8 volunteers. The data indicated that sorghum flour milled at particle size < 400 um resulted in the lowest GI of 32 ± 16. 8. These findings should assist in development of lower GI sorghum foods...|$|E
