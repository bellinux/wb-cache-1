40|$|Broiler {{production}} in the United States is coordinated almost entirely through systems of production contracts, in which a grower’s compensation is based, in part, on how the grower’s performance compares with that of other growers. The industry is undergoing a gradual structural change as production shifts to larger broiler enterprises that provide larger shares of an operator’s household income. Larger enterprises require substantially larger investments in broiler housing, and new or retrofitted houses are also {{an important source of}} productivity growth in the industry. This report, based on a large and representative survey of broiler operations, describes the industry’s organization, housing features, contract design, fees and enterprise cost structures, and farm and household finances. broilers, chickens, production contracts, <b>broiler</b> <b>grower</b> financial performance, chicken housing, chicken litter, poultry, Farm Management, Production Economics,...|$|E
40|$|The aim was {{to study}} the effects of dietary pea {{inclusion}} and the addition of Avizyme 1200 -enzyme cocktail on broiler performance, intestinal viscosity and organoleptic quality of meat. The experimental design was a 4 × 2 factorial, the factors being dietary pea inclusion (0, 150, 300 and 450 g kg- 1) in the diets fed from day 9 to day 38 and the addition of Avizyme 1200 enzyme cocktail including amylase, protease and xylanase during the entire experiment. The growth of birds improved (p ≤ 0. 018) with pea inclusion in a cubic manner. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) of the birds fed on unsupplemented diets improved along pea inclusion, while pea inclusion impaired the FCR on the birds on enzyme cocktail supplemented diets (p ≤ 0. 006). The use of the enzyme cocktail improved the body weight, body weight gain and FCR of the broilers and decreased intestinal viscosity (p 0. 05).

The use of contracts to vertically coordinate the production and marketing of agricultural commodities has become common practice in many agricultural sectors. Commodities such as tomatoes and broilers have been pro duced almost exclusively under contracts be tween processors and independent growers for decades. For example, in broiler industry con tracts, processors control almost every aspect of production from the distribution of inputs (chicks and feed) to decisions about when to harvest mature birds and repopulate houses with new flocks. Most contracts are written such that they cover one flock at the time. In order to contract production of chickens with a processor a grower is required to construct housing facilities and to equip them according to a processor’s specification.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The broiler {{industry}} in the United States has undergone tremendous change {{since the end of}} World War II. Several structural changes in the industry facilitated the widespread adoption of new technology. Improvements in feeding, breeding, and managing made production more efficient. Extensive use of contract growing and production financing accompanied the increase in broiler production. The largest expansion of production took place in the South Atlantic States and the South Central States. Rapid transportation, combined with lower production costs, enabled southern fryers to compete favorably with Oregon-grown fryers. To meet competition from <b>broiler</b> <b>growers</b> in other states, the Oregon Fryer Commission has undertaken a modest promotion program. It would be desirable for the Oregon Fryer Commission to know the most advantageous uses for its limited amount of promotion dollars. This study was undertaken to determine production costs of a few selected broiler enterprises in Oregon, and the effectiveness of four types of in-store promotional material in increasing fryer sales. The growers selected for the cost of production study appeared to operate three of the better broiler enterprises in Oregon. Average costs for each grower were calculated from data of the last four broods marketed in 1963. Total cost per pound of broiler marketed by these growers was 17. 94 cents, 18. 64 cents, and 16. 90 cents. Assuming each grower received the average Oregon price of 17 cents per pound in 1963, the first two growers would have lost 830 and 4, 110 per brood, while the third grower would have made a profit of 100 per brood. In the promotion study, two posters, a banner, and a gondola were employed as in-store promotional material. The sample stores were selected from two food chains in the Portland metropolitan area and one food chain in the Salem area. The sample size of Chain A was 1 Z stores, while the sample size of both Chain B and Chain C was six stores. Store selections were based on large volume of fryer sales and the location of stores with respect to different socioeconomic groups. The study was divided into three periods: two weeks of prepromotion, four weeks of promotion, and two weeks of postpromotion. The purpose was to determine the number of pounds of fryers sold weekly in each store during the three periods. Increases or decreases of fryer sales for each store were determined by comparing fryer sales during the promotion and postpromotion periods to fryer sales during the prepromotion period. To determine promotion effectiveness, changes of fryer sales in stores with promotional material were compared to changes of fryer sales in check stores with no promotional material. It appeared that promotion by Fryer Commission poster and revised Fryer Commission poster during one, two, and four-week intervals was similarly effective. At the same time, promotion effectiveness of banners was considerably less. An elaborate, colored, pictorial poster appeared more effective in promotion than a simple, low-cost banner. Emphasizing the word “Oregon” seemed to have little effect in increasing fryer sales. Enlarging fryer display space by the use of gondolas increased fryer sales during short time periods. Carry-over effects of promotion seemed to be slight. Featuring fryers at reduced prices during a week increased sales volume significantly. Sales volume following a week of small price reductions returned to its approximate prepromotion level. However, sales volume following weeks of large price reductions was slightly below its prepromotion level. This presents a question of the effect of price specials on total volume of fryer sales and on profits {{over a longer period of}} time for retailers, processors, and <b>broiler</b> <b>growers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Emerging broiler famers {{are faced}} with the {{challenge}} of acquiring contracts with the contract providers in South Africa. The question is, are these emerging farmers able to perform well financially regardless of the availability of contracts to their disposal. Profitability is one of the core issues to the development and sustainability of emerging broiler farmers. A well performing farmer is the one who is able to manage and improve the good financial performance of the farm in general. In order to determine the financial performance of the farm, financial ratios can be useful in determining and analyzing how a farm performs financially. In this study, four financial ratios are used to analyze and determine how emerging broiler farmers in Gauteng perform financially. This is done through a representative farm model which makes use of ten emerging farmers situated in the southern and northern sides of Gauteng. Out of ten emerging broiler farmers that took part in the study, the results show that only two of them are producing under contracts. This is an indication that emerging broiler farmers in Gauteng are characterized by both financial and production risk. This further implies that farmers who do not have contracts are likely to have a poor financial performance in as far as broiler enterprise is concerned. The study establishes the differences between the contract growers and the non contractors that form the representative farm model and this is achieved by looking the results of the financial ratios. The study further distinguishes the financial performances between the southern and northern sides of Gauteng which form the representative farm model. The results indicated that although 80 % of the emerging <b>broiler</b> <b>growers</b> in Gauteng do not produce under contracts, they are still able to perform well financially. However the contract growers outperform the no contractors in terms of financial performance due to a well defined market structure. Dissertation (MScAgric) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|Between 2002 and 2006, the {{feasibility}} of a regional chain for sustainable production of poultry meat is studied. The study is initiated by a company, owned by a family of <b>broiler</b> <b>growers</b> (Kuijpers Kip) and is financed by the Ministry of agriculture, nature management and fisheries and the Ministry of transport, public works and water management. Representatives of the Dutch poultry business, non-governmental organizations and knowledge organizations engineered the study. The goal {{of this study was}} to design a concept for a regional and sustainable production chain for poultry meat and meat products, and to judge its feasibility. The study was divided in two phases. During the fist phase, alternative scenarios for poultry meat production are designed, and for all scenarios technical, economical, legal, organizational and commercial feasibility, social acceptation, animal welfare and environmental effects (with attention for transport effects) are explored. Four alternative scenarios for broiler production and three different slaughtering and processing scenarios are designed. In the alternative broiler production scenarios, the last three days of the incubation and the hatching don¿t take place at a hatchery but at the broiler plant. After 18 days of incubation, the eggs are placed in litter on the floor or on a battery. In the four different scenarios the time on the battery was 0, 10, 18 or 42 days, respectively. The slaughtering and processing and scenario¿s were: slaughtering and processing at the poultry farm; slaughtering at the farm (mobile slaughtering plant) and processing in a traditional processing company, and slaughtering and processing in a traditional poultry processing plant. During the second phase, the scenario `physical short chain¿ is studied in detail. In this physical short chain, the hatching process, broiling and slaughtering are concentrated at one large poultry plant. After slaughtering the carcasses are transported to a processing company, but the farmer directs the process. Therefore he is responsible for the total process and for the final product. Tests and calculations concerning production of the poultry, costs for slaughter, marketing, and reduction of transport costs indicate that the physical short chain is economical practicable. Reduction of transport for day-old chicks and matured chickens is about 400. 000 km/year for this company...|$|R
40|$|Poultry {{operations}} require numerous variable inputs for {{the operation}} to run. Due to this {{it is extremely difficult}} for poultry growers to estimate the financial capacity of the operation. The poultry industry had evolved over the years from back yard non-commercial hobby farms to vertically integrated contract farms. These changes have made it extremely important that poultry growers fully understand the revenue, expenses, and income associated with the operation. Under the contract system, it is difficult for poultry growers to have a full understanding of and expectation for their projected expenses and revenues from the operation due to variability in production conditions and prices and the flock-to-flock variations in revenues that result from the tournament pay system. Therefore, accurately estimating their projected cash flow becomes problematic because of the method used to determine their payments as well possible bonus incentives. In addition, traditional poultry operation budgets are therefore often difficult to use and interpret. Projecting cash flow into the future is complicated by unforeseen circumstances such as changes in revenues and costs that normally occur year to year (Cunningham 2 ̆ 6 Fairchild, 2012). The purpose of this project is to create an excel program to help poultry growers better estimate and analyze the cash flow of their operations. The program will take into account a major portion of the possible revenues and expenses the grower may have related to the broiler operation. Taking into account the major sections will help give the grower as accurate as possible a portrayal of their financials. The excel program being created, called Arkansas Broiler Enterprise Assessment Tool (AR B. E. A. T), will allow for growers {{to have the ability to}} input information regarding their own operation rather than using generalized budgets. AR B. E. A. T is designed for use by contract <b>broiler</b> <b>growers</b> that are working directly with integrators. All independent contract operations are different. Therefore, the program uses a panel of 7 growers along with current research to build the default calculations. As the user works through the program, they will enter their own information and the totals will recalculate based off of their inputs. In the event growers do not have their own information, the panel defaults are there for users that do not have full information about the operation. It is great for potential growers to gain an understanding of the potential revenue, expenses, and income to expect from the operation. Growers can also utilize the program to run “what if scenarios” to determine how changes in costs and other areas will impact the overall financials of the operation. AR B. E. A. T is not perfect and it does have its limitations just like other financial analysis tools. Ultimately it comes down to the growers’ decisions and management of the flock...|$|R

A study was conducted for 42 days on 240 broiler chicks treated with trace elements chelates with amino acids: B-TRAXIMRTEC Cu-I 30; B-TRAXIMRTEC Fe- 120. The broiler chicks were housed in cages (10 chicks per cage, 6 cages per group) and assigned to 4 groups (C, E 1, E 3 and E 3) fed on the same corn-soybean meal-based diet.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Models of between-farm {{transmission}} of pathogens have identified service vehicles and social groups as risk factors mediating {{the spread of}} infection. Because of high levels of economic organization {{in much of the}} poultry industry, we examined the importance of company affiliation, as distinct from social contacts, in a model of the potential spread of avian influenza among broiler poultry farms in a poultry-dense region in the United States. The contribution of company affiliation to risk of between-farm disease transmission has not been previously studied. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We obtained data on the nature and frequency of business and social contacts through a national survey of <b>broiler</b> poultry <b>growers</b> in the United States. Daily rates of contact were estimated using Monte Carlo analysis. Stochastic modeling techniques were used to estimate the exposure risk posed by a single infectious farm to other farms in the region and relative risk of exposure for farms under different scenarios. The mean daily rate of vehicular contact was 0. 82 vehicles/day. The magnitude of exposure risk ranged from < 1 % to 25 % under varying parameters. Risk of between-farm transmission was largely driven by company affiliation, with farms in the same company group as the index farm facing as much as a 5 -fold increase in risk compared to farms contracted with different companies. Employment of part-time workers contributed to significant increases in risk in most scenarios, notably for farms who hired day-laborers. Social visits were significantly less important in determining risk. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Biosecurity interventions should be based on information on industry structure and company affiliation, and include part-time workers as potentially unrecognized sources of viral transmission. Modeling efforts to understand pathogen transmission in the context of industrial food animal production should consider company affiliation in addition to geospatial factors and pathogen characteristics. Restriction of social contacts among farmers may be less useful in reducing between-farm transmission...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} so that the possible effects of thermally-oxidised dietary oil and vitamin E supplementation could be determined on the performance, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant defence system and some blood and meat quality traits of broilers. <b>Broilers</b> were fed <b>grower</b> diets containing fresh or oxidised oil, supplemented with and without vitamin E (200 mg/kg) from {{four to six weeks}} of age. Neither oxidised dietary oil nor vitamin E supplementation had any adverse effect on weight gain, feed consumption or feed conversion ratio. However, the broilers that received oxidised oil had lower levels of plasma cholesterol and triglyceride compared to the control. The glucose level was neither influenced by oxidised oil nor by vitamin E supplementation. The plasma malondialdehyde level increased slightly in broilers fed oxidised oil, indicating increased lipid peroxidation. Higher glutathione peroxidise (GSH–Px) activity observed in the broilers fed oxidised oil suggests greater oxidative stress. Vitamin E supplementation partly depressed GSH–Px activity in broilers fed oxidised oil. This depression in enzyme activity might be the result of homeostatic compensation. The uric acid concentration was not affected by oxidised oil and vitamin E supplementation. Feeding oxidised oil did not cause a marked discolouration in breast meat. Vitamin E supplementation had some beneficial effects on colour measurements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Effects of an {{antibiotic}} growth promoter (flavomycin), a probiotic mixture (protexin) or {{a mixture of}} organic acids including plant extract and mineral salts (genex) on performance, intestinal microbial flora and tissue morphology have been examined in 160 day-old Ross 308 broiler chicks. Commercial corn-soybean-based <b>broiler</b> starter and <b>grower</b> diets were formulated as basal diets for control treatment. Basal diets were supplemented with a probiotic (0. 1 % protexin), {{an antibiotic}} growth promoter (0. 1 % flavomycin), an organic acids mixture (0. 2 % genex) {{or a combination of}} a probiotic with an organic acids mixture (0. 1 % protexin+ 0. 2 % genex). In total, five dietary treatments were employed in the trial. Live weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion ratio and mortality were not affected by dietary treatments throughout the experiment. However, relative weight of the small intestine of antibiotic treatment had significantly less than that of the basal diet. Intestinal microbial flora and tissue were determined at 21 and 42 days. In both periods, antibiotic orth th organic acids mixture treatments significantly decreased total bacteria counts. In addition to that all treatments significantly decreased gram negative bacteria counts compared to the basal diet. Probiotic treatment significantly increased ileum and jejunum villus height, whereas antibiotic treatment significantly decreased muscularis thickness compared to the basal diet...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to assess the efficacy of plant extracts as alternatives for antimicrobial growth promoters in broiler diets. The performance experiment included 1, 200 male broilers raised from 1 to 42 days of age. The metabolism experiment used 96 male <b>broilers</b> in the <b>grower</b> phase housed in metabolic cages for total excreta collection. At {{the end of the}} metabolism experiment, 24 birds were sacrificed to assess organ morphometrics. In both experiments, the following treatments were applied: control diet (CD); CD + 10 ppm avilamycin; CD + 1000 ppm oregano extract; CD + 1000 ppm clove extract; CD + 1000 ppm cinnamon extract; and CD + 1000 ppm red pepper extract. The microencapsulated extracts contained 20 % of essential oil. No significant differences (P> 0. 05) in the studied performance parameters were observed among treatments. The dietary supplementation of the extracts did not influence (P> 0. 05) nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolizable energy values. In general, organ morphometrics was not affected by the experimental treatments, but birds fed the control diet had higher liver relative weight (P< 0. 05) as compared to those fed the diet containing red pepper extract, which presented the lowest liver relative weight. These results showed that there was no effect of the tested plant extracts on live performance or in organ morphometrics...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Flavor {{comparisons}} were made using triangle difference and consumer preference tests to compare meat samples from broilers fed a commercial ration without an anticoccidial agent to those from broilers fed narasin, an anticoccidial agent. Two hundred, day-old chicks were divided in two pens of 50 males each and two pens of 50 females each. Within each sex, one pen was fed commercial <b>broiler</b> starter and <b>grower</b> rations {{while the other}} pen was fed a similar ration supplemented with narasin at 80 mg/kg diet. There {{were no significant differences}} in growth, feed efficiency, or mortality between the two feeding regimens. Medicated feed was withdrawn 72 hr prior to slaughter at 49 days of age. The meat was evaluated by both a sensory panel and a consumer panel. Meat was prepared for flavor evaluation by the sensory panel either by pressure deep fat frying or by oven roasting. Sensory panel evaluations were made on freshly cooked product and on cooked meat refrigerated for 24 hr and reheated in a conventional oven to 45 C prior to evaluation. Consumer panelists were served only fried chicken shortly after cooking. No flavor differences were detected by the sensory panel with freshly cooked or reheated chicken. The consumer panel forced-choice test indicated no preference. Narasin fed at 80 ppm in feed with a 72 hr withdrawal does not alter the flavor of fried or roasted chicken within the limits of methods used.

40|$|Five {{different}} {{commercial poultry}} feeds namely, broiler finisher, broiler starter, <b>broiler</b> super starter, <b>grower</b> mash and layer top mash obtained from their trade outlets in Akure, Nigeria were examined for their microbiological and physicochemical qualities using standard microbiological and analytical methods. The bacterial count was highest in broiler starter with 2. 50 H 10 4 cfu mLG 1, while the least count of 6. 60 H 10 2 cfu mLG 1 {{was recorded in}} layer top mash. Fungal count was highest in layer top mash (7. 40 H 10 2 sfu mLG 1) and least in grower mash (1. 50 H 10 2 sfu mLG 1). A total of seventeen microorganisms were isolated which include Aerobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus, Erwinia amylovora, Mirococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus flavus, A. fumigatus, A. niger, Acaulopa macrospore, Cladosporium fulvum, Dotchiza populae, Fusarium sp., Geotrichium candidum, Pleurophrgmium sp., Rhizopus stolonifer, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Proximate composition revealed the presence of moisture, ash, fat, crude fibre and protein content. The mineral analysis shows that, the poultry feeds contained essential elements, namely K +, Na +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and P. The presence of some pathogenic microorganisms in the poultry feeds lucidly revealed the level of contamination. Therefore, the commercial poultry feeds should be periodically examined for bio safety, so as to reduce or probably prevent the risk of cross contamination of poultry and poultry products...|$|R
40|$|Day-old male chicks {{were used}} to test the effects of a {{combination}} of formic and propionic acids (CFP) added to wheat- and barley-based diets on the performance and gut histomorphology of broilers. The CFP, containing formic and propionic acids based on an inorganic phyllo-silicate carrier, was added to starter and <b>grower</b> <b>broiler</b> diets of standard (NRC, 1994) or lower nutrient density (LND) using different levels of wheat and barley. Body weight gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of broiler chicks were significantly (P < 0. 001) improved by CFP supplementation at 21 days of age regardless of nutrient density (ND). However, at 35 days of age CFP addition significantly (P < 0. 001) increased BWG and FCR. Proventriculus weight was also significantly affected by the dietary treatments. Ileal viscosity was significantly (P < 0. 05) affected by ND which was associated with wheat and barley contents, whereas feed viscosity was significantly (P < 0. 05) affected by CFP supplementation. Villus height was significantly (P < 0. 05) increased by the CFP supplementation. In the case of villus width, an interaction effect was observed: there was a significant (P < 0. 05) decrease in the group fed the standard ND diet, but only a numerical decrease in the group fed the LND diet compared to control group. No significant effect of dietary treatment on the thickness of the lamina muscularis mucosae could be detected...|$|R
40|$|The {{approach}} of Harris (1970) and Harris et al. (1984) {{was used to}} develop mathematical profit functions for describing the bioeconomic objectives in an integrated three-way cross commercial broiler production system. The reproductive and productive performances of the pureline maternal grandparent female and the single cross female parent were included to reflect {{the impact of the}} traits expressed in those populations. The resulting complex function was approximated with linear and quadratic equations. Inputs (costs) in the system included feed, housing, labor and facilities, and processing. Outputs (returns) included salvage value of the cull hens and the processed cut-up broilers. A systematic procedure was developed to calculate relative economic values of the traits in the breeding objective from the bioeconomic function. The traits were boiler livability, boiler weight, proportion of carcass, proportion of breast-thigh-leg, <b>broiler</b> feed consumption, <b>grower</b> livability, layer livability, rate of lay, settability, fertility, and hatchability. The relative economic values thus obtained were 1. 51, 1. 00, 5. 99, 3. 21, -. 20, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, and 0 in paternal grandparent; 4. 48, 1. 00, 5. 99, 3. 21, -. 20, 3. 00, 3. 10, 4. 58, 2. 97, 3. 04 and 3. 04 in maternal great-grandparent male; and 9. 30, 1. 00, 5. 99, 3. 21, -. 20, 7. 88, 8. 15, 12. 06, 7. 80, 7. 97, and 7. 97 in maternal great-grandparent female, for the traits in the above order...|$|R
40|$|In {{the poultry}} industry, several {{alternative}} methods for disposal of dead birds have been developed. This study evaluated {{the efficacy of}} a dehydrated poultry mortality-soybean meal (DPSM) product, made from 60 % on-farm whole dead birds, 40 % soybean oil meal, and a preservative amendment, for inclusion in broiler diets. Composite samples of the DPSM product were obtained for nutritional and microbiological analysis. A subsequent 42 -d broiler growout experiment was conducted using DPSM incrementally (0 to 100 %) substituted for the protein source component (i. e., soybean oil meal) in starter and grower diets. Nutritionally, the DPSM product was similar to soybean oil meal (SBOM), with approximately 51. 5 % CP, 2. 81 % Lys, 0. 72 % Met, 1. 85 % Thr, 3. 14 % Arg, and 1. 36 % TSAA. True amino acid digestibilities of DPSM, however, were higher than soybean oil meal. Likewise, crude fat (18. 03 %) and ash (8. 00 %) concentrations of DPSM were higher than those typically observed for SBOM. Although at low levels, 13 genera of bacteria (including some pathogenic organisms) were isolated from the DPSM product. When replacing SBOM in <b>broiler</b> starter and <b>grower</b> diets, DPSM, at lower, more practical replacement rates, did not significantly influence body weight, feed consumption, or feed conversion. According {{to the results of}} this study, using DPSM in partial substitution for SBOM in broiler diets was a safe, efficient, and economically feasible alternative for dead bird disposal.
