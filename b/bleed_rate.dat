40|$|For the {{development}} of optimal perfusion processes {{the effect of the}} feed and <b>bleed</b> <b>rate</b> on cell growth in a perfusion bioreactor was studied. The viable-cell density, viability, growth, death, and lysis rate and cell-cycle distribution of a hybridoma cell line producing an IgG 1 were studied over a range of specific feed and bleed rates. It was found that the feed and bleed rates applied in the different cultures could be divided into two regions based on the viable-cell density and cell-cycle distribution. The cultures in the first region, low feed rates (0. 5 and 1. 0 d(- 1)) combined with low bleed rates (0. 05 and 0. 10 d(- 1)), were nutrient-limited, as an increase in the feed rate resulted in an increase in the viable-cell density. The cultures in the second region, high feed and bleed rates, were nonnutrient-limited. In this region the viable-cell density decreased more or less linearly with an increase in the <b>bleed</b> <b>rate</b> and was independent of the feed rate. This suggests that the cells were limited by a cell-related factor. Comparison of Trypan-blue dye-exclusion measurements and lactate-dehydrogenase activity measurements revealed that cell lysis was not negligible in this bioreactor set-up. Therefore, lactate-dehydrogenase activity measurements were essential to measure the death rate accurately. The specific growth rate was nearly constant for all tested conditions. The viability increased with an increase of the <b>bleed</b> <b>rate</b> and was independent of the feed rate. Furthermore, the specific productivity of monoclonal antibody was constant under all tested conditions. For the optimal design of a perfusion process it should first be established whether viability is an important parameter. If not, a <b>bleed</b> <b>rate</b> as low as possible should be chosen. If low viabilities are to be avoided, the <b>bleed</b> <b>rate</b> chosen should be higher, with the value depending on the desired viability. Next, the feed rate should be set at such a rate that the cells are just in the nonnutrient-limited region. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E

30|$|Bleeding is a {{frequent}} complication of PNL and management of bleeding is crucial. According to studies that have included large patient series, bleeding which requires transfusion {{can be seen in}} 5 – 18  % of cases and bleeding which requires embolization can be seen in 0.3 – 1  % (Michel et al. 2007; Skolarikos and de la Rosette 2008; Kessaris et al. 1995; Turna et al. 2007; El-Nahas et al. 2007). Imaging modality during percutaneous access (ultrasonography vs. fluoroscopy), tract dilatation technique, tract size, and tract length are all factors, which can affect <b>bleeding</b> <b>rates</b> in PNL (Pearle et al. 1998). In the light of this information, mini-PNL seems to be a preferable option due to its lesser parenchymal injury formation. In a study by Ates et al.

40|$|For the {{development}} of optimal perfusion processes, insight into the effect of feed and <b>bleed</b> <b>rate</b> on cell growth, productivity, and metabolism is essential. In the here presented study {{the effect of the}} feed and <b>bleed</b> <b>rate</b> on cell metabolism was investigated using metabolic flux analysis. Under all tested feed and bleed rates the biomass concentration as calculated from the nitrogen balance (biomass-nitrogen) increased linearly with an increase in feed rate, as would be expected. However, {{depending on the size of}} the feed and <b>bleed</b> <b>rate,</b> this increase was attained in two different ways. At low feed and bleed rates (Region I) the increase was obtained through an increase in viable-cell concentration, while the cellular-nitrogen content remained constant. At high feed and bleed rates (Region II) the increase was attained through an increase in cellular-nitrogen content, while the cell concentration remained constant. Per gram biomass-nitrogen, the specific consumption and production rates of the majority of the nutrients and products were identical in both regions, as were most of the fluxes. The major difference between the two regions was an increased flux from pyruvate to lactate and a decreased flux of pyruvate toward citrate in region II. The decreased in-flux at the level of citrate can either be balanced by a decreased out-flux toward lipid biosynthesis leading to a lower fraction of lipids in the cell, by a decreased out-flux toward the citric acid cycle resulting in a decreased energy generation, or by a combination of these. Finally, the specific productivity increases less than the nitrogen content per cell in region II, which implies that for obtaining maximum production rates it is important to increase the cell density and not only the biomass density...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{assessed}} whether fibrinogen concentrate as targeted first-line hemostatic {{therapy was}} more effective than placebo or a standardized transfusion algorithm in controlling coagulopathic bleeding in patients undergoing major aortic surgery. MethodsIn this single-center, prospective, double-blind study, adults undergoing elective thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic replacement surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized to intraoperative fibrinogen concentrate (n =  29) or placebo (n =  32). Study medication was given if patients had clinically relevant coagulopathic bleeding, measured by 5 -minute bleeding mass, after cardiopulmonary bypass removal, protamine administration, and surgical hemostasis. Fibrinogen concentrate dosing was individualized using the thromboelastometric FIBTEM test. If bleeding continued, a standardized transfusion algorithm was followed. In the placebo group, all 32 patients received 1 transfusion cycle of fresh-frozen plasma/platelets, and 30 patients required a second transfusion cycle; none of these patients received any other procoagulant therapy. Change in <b>bleeding</b> <b>rate</b> after treatment was compared using t tests. ResultsMean change in <b>bleeding</b> <b>rate</b> after fibrinogen concentrate was − 48. 3 g/ 5 min, compared with 0. 4 g/ 5 min after placebo (P < . 001), − 16. 1 g/ 5 min after 1 transfusion cycle (fresh-frozen plasma or platelets; P =. 003), and − 28. 0 g/ 5 min after 2 transfusion cycles (fresh-frozen plasma and platelets; P =. 11).

40|$|Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess whether the use of staple line reinforcement (SLR) reduces staple line complications (SLC). Mechanical staple lines are essential for gastrointestinal surgery such as bariatric surgery. However, SLC, such as bleeding and leakage, still occur. The purposes of this study were to provide quantitative evidence on the relative efficacy of gastric SLR and to compare the rates of effectiveness of three commonly used methods. Methods A search of the medical literature in English lan-guage journals identified studies from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2013, using the following reinforcement types: (1) no reinforcement, (2) oversewing, (3) a biocompatible glycolide copolymer, and (4) bovine pericardium after gastric bypasses and sleeve gastrectomies. Types of reinforcement were compared using a random-effects model. Results This meta-analysis reviewed 16, 967 articles, extracting data on 56, 309 patients concerning leak and 41, 864 patients concerning bleeding. Over 40 % of patients had no reinforcement, resulting in the highest leak rate (2. 75 %) and <b>bleed</b> <b>rate</b> (3. 45 %). Overall, reinforcing with bovine peri-cardium had the lowest leak (1. 28 %) and bleed (1. 23 %) rates. Suture oversewing was better than no reinforcement but not as effective as bovine pericardium for leak (2. 45 %) and bleed (2. 69 %) rates. Buttressing with a biocompatible glycolide copolymer resulted in the second highest leak rate (2. 61 %) and a <b>bleed</b> <b>rate</b> of 2. 48 % but had significantly lower bleed rates than no reinforcement. Conclusions SLR provided superior results for patients com-pared to no reinforcement for reducing SLC. Buttressing with bovine pericardium resulted in the most favorable outcomes. The effectiveness of different methods used to reinforce the staple line in gastric surgery does not appear to be equal. Keywords Staple lines. Staple line leak. Staple line bleed.

OBJECTIVE: To report the major bleeding and fatal <b>bleeding</b> <b>rates</b> in patients randomized to placebo or observation (i. e. no anticoagulation therapy) for the secondary prevention of recurrent VTE. PATIENTS/METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to summarize the <b>rates</b> of major <b>bleeding</b> and fatal bleeding in patients randomized to placebo or observation during the secondary prevention of VTE. Unrestricted searches of Medline (1950 to August 31, 2013), Embase (1980 to August 31, 2013), and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials using the OVID interface were conducted. Publications from potentially relevant journals were also searched by hand. We used a random-effects model to pool study results and I(2) testing to assess for heterogeneity. RESULTS: The analysis included 11 studies and 3, 965 patients who were followed for a median of 24 months. The overall pooled major <b>bleeding</b> <b>rate</b> was 0. 45 per 100 patient-years (95 % CI: 0. 29 to 0. 64; I(2) : 0 %), and the overall pooled fatal <b>bleeding</b> <b>rate</b> was 0. 14 per 100 patient-years (95 % CI: 0. 057 to 0. 26; I(2) : 0 %).
