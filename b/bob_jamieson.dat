In June 1981, NBC announced that Tom Brokaw would depart Today to anchor the NBC Nightly News with Roger Mudd {{beginning in the}} spring of 1982. The search for Brokaws replacement was on, and the initial candidates were all NBC News correspondents, including John Palmer, Chris Wallace, Bob Kur, <b>Bob</b> <b>Jamieson,</b> and Jessica Savitch.
