25|$|The first Valpolicella {{producer}} to commercially {{market a}} ripasso wine was Masi {{in the early}} 1980s. When the style first became popular in the late 20th century, it was rarely noted on the wine label. There was also debate about whether it was even permitted to be included under DOC regulations. If it was mentioned at all it was relegated to the <b>back</b> <b>label</b> wine description notes. Today the term ripasso is freely permitted to be used, with several examples on the wine market labeled as being made in the ripasso style. In late 2009, Ripasso della Valpolicella received its own DOC designation.|$|E

Production and software revision codes were imprinted as stamps on the <b>back</b> <b>label</b> to correspond with the software version and producer. All licensed NTSC and PAL cartridges are a standard shade of gray plastic, {{with the exception of}} The Legend of Zelda and , which were manufactured in gold-plastic carts. Unlicensed carts were produced in black, robin egg blue, and gold, and are all slightly different shapes than standard NES cartridges. Nintendo also produced yellow-plastic carts for internal use at Nintendo Service Centers, although these [...] "test carts" [...] were never made available for purchase. All licensed US cartridges were made by Nintendo, Konami and Acclaim.

[...] A crianza is wine aged for at least two years, at least one of which was in oak. Rioja Reserva is aged for at least three years, of which at least one year is in oak. Finally, Rioja Gran Reserva wines have been aged at least two years in oak and three years in bottle. Reserva and Gran Reserva wines are not necessarily produced each year. Also produced are wines in a semi-crianza style, those that have had a couple of months oak influence but not enough to be called a full crianza. The designation of crianza, Reserva etc. might not always appear on the front label but may appear on a neck or <b>back</b> <b>label</b> {{in the form of a}} stamp designation known as Consejo.|$|E

In 1959, after {{recovering from the}} ill effects of cyanide poisoning, Whitney sold his Rochester business and moved to New York City, opening a gallery at 585 Broadway with Andrew W. Paradise, Mathew Brady's [...] "right-hand man." [...] Nevertheless, {{during the winter of}} 1861–62, Brady would commission Whitney to take [...] "views of the fortifications around Washington and places of interest for the Government." [...] These would include scenes in and around Arlington, Falls Church and Alexandria, VA. In March 1862, Brady again dispatched Whitney and Brady operator, David Woodbury, to take photographs on the Bull Run battlefield. Whitney also relates that he took views at Yorktown, Williamsburg, White House, Gaines' Mill, and Westover and Berkeley Landings during McClellan's Peninsula Campaign. Whitney personally appears in an unusually large number of photographs from 1861 to 1863, and while {{there is no question that}} Whitney took photographs for Brady, alas, there are no wartime views specifically ascribed to him. Whitney's last documented self-portrait (Anthony, Views in Washington City, 2733) is on March 27, 1863 during which time he documented the Southern Plains Indian Delegation inside the White House's well lit conservatory (2734, 2735). In addition to Anthony's post-war views with <b>back</b> <b>label</b> attributions to Whitney & Paradise, Whitney is also listed as working with a Mr. Beckwith in Norwalk, Connecticut. from 1865 to 1871, and then alone in Norwalk from 1873 to 1880. Lastly he can be placed in Wilton, Connecticut from 1879 to 1886.|$|E

50|$|When {{the rack}} was manufactured, as a wire was installed, each end would be marked with wire labels (a.k.a. wire markers).

A number strip would be peeled out and {{wrapped around the}} wire near the end. Wire numbers were {{made up of a}} series of the number strips so wire 1051 would be four strips. There are also pocket sized printers that print onto an adhesive <b>backed</b> <b>label</b> that can be wrapped around the wire.|$|R
