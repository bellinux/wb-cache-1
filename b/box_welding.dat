Firstly, this thesis investigates the induced residual stress distributions in square welded sections fabricated from HSS plates with sin-gle and multiple weld passes. The non-destructive neutron diﬀraction technique was used to investigate the residual stresses in six test specimens: four specimens fabricated from 5 mm HSS plates using single weld passes, {{and the other two}} spec-imens fabricated from 16 mm HSS plates using six weld passes. Secondly, this thesis investigates the ultimate strength of short and slender <b>welded</b> <b>box</b> (HS) and short and slender composite sections (CB) fabricated from HSS and ﬁlled with HSC. Herein, forty ﬁve short test specimens having width to thickness ratios ranging from 15 to 40 and length to width ratios ranging from 3. 5 to 5 were tested. Furthermore, ﬁfteen slender test specimens (HS) and thirty nine slender test specimens (CB) having width to thickness ratios ranging from 15 to 40 and slenderness ratios ranging from 18 to 124 were tested to failure. Furthermore, ﬁnite element modelling (FEM) of the all test specimens was veri-ﬁed with the experimental results.

40|$|Abstract. For {{aerospace}} applications, light-weight {{boxes to}} protect and carry electronic equipment need to be sealed. The main requirements on the components are low thermal expansion and gas tightness. The common material for such an application is a metal matrix composite (MMC).

50|$|The Medium Tank M4 {{was used}} in all theatres of the Second World War. It had a {{versatile}} reliable design and was easy to produce, thus huge numbers were made and provided to both Britain and the USSR by the United States under Lend-Lease. Despite official opinions, the Medium Tank M4 was well liked by some Soviet tankers, while others called it the best tank for peacetime service. When Britain received the tank, it was given the designation Sherman, which {{gave rise to the}} name Sherman tank and the UK naming its US-built tanks after American Civil War generals. Both the British and the Soviets re-armed their M4s with their own tank guns. The Soviets re-armed a small number with the standard 76 mm F-34 tank gun but so much 75 mm ammunition was supplied by the US that the conversions were not widespread. The British conversion was better known as the Sherman Firefly, which had the 3-inch (76.2mm) calibre Ordnance QF 17-pounder anti-tank gun mounted in the standard turret with a new mantlet and the radio moved to an armoured <b>box</b> <b>welded</b> to the turret bustle. The combination of British and American weaponry proved desirable, although despite the United States building a few 17-pounder Fireflies from new, it never went into mass production and did not see action. The US had its own reasonably effective 76 mm calibre long-barrel gun for the Sherman, which was much-used later in the war. The Firefly thus remained a British variant of the Sherman. The M10 Tank Destroyer was also up-gunned with the 17-pounder, creating the M10C tank destroyer. This {{was used in}} accordance with British tactical doctrine for tank destroyers, in that they were considered self-propelled anti-tank guns rather than aggressive 'tank hunters'. Used in this fashion, it proved an effective weapon.|$|R

In this ocntext letter <b>box</b> repair <b>welds</b> applied to thin ferritic steel plates to simulate repair of postulated shallow cracks have been manufactured for the purpose of experimental and numerical analysis of welding residual stresses. Two speciments have been procured, one of them prepared in accordance with a standard welding procedure, while in the second case a different procedure was followed in order to obtain extended martensite formation in th heat affected zone. Residual stresses have been determined in both speciments by neutron diffraction at the HFR of the JRC in Petten, The Netherlands. In parallel Institut de Soudure in France has performed a full 3 -dimensional analysis of the residual stress field for the standard welding case taking into account the materials and phase transformations. The experimental data obtained for both specimens clearly suggest that the non-conventional welding procedure rendered higher maximum stress values. In the case of the standard welding procedure numerical and experimental data show a reasonable qualitative agreement. The maximum stress value was in both cases found in the same region of the material - in the base metal justundernaeth the weld pool - and in both cases found to be of similar magnitude (~ 800 MPa found in neutron diffraction and ~ 700 MPa found in numerical analysis).

40|$|Empa’s {{research}} {{efforts in the}} 1990 s provided evidence that a considerable increase of the fatigue strength of welded aluminum beams {{can be achieved by}} externally bonding pultruded carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates using rubber-toughened epoxies over the fatigue-weak welding zone on their tensile flange. The reinforcing effect obtained is determined by the stiffness of the unidirectional CFRP laminate which has twice the elastic modulus of aluminum. One can therefore easily follow that an unstressed CFRP laminate reinforcement of welded beams made of steel will not lead to a substantial increase in fatigue strength of the steel structure. This consideration led to the idea of prestressing an external reinforcement of the welded zone.

To study the overall buckling behavior of high-strength steel columns, an experimental investigation on the ultimate bearing capacity of <b>weld</b> <b>box</b> and H columns with a nominal yield stress of 690 MPa subjected to axial compression was carried out. Twelve columns with slenderness ratios ranging from 30 to 70 were comprised in the experiment.

By comparing the experimental results with the buckling curves stipulated in GB 50017 - 2003, Eurocode 3, and ANSI/AISC 360 - 10, it is found that the current design curves underestimate the ultimate strength of the axially loaded box and H columns welded by 690 MPa high-strength steel plates.

Upper superstructure was widened: <b>welded</b> <b>boxes</b> on either sides were abandoned. This new superstructure design increased its height to 2160 mm. The back wall of the fighting compartment got straightened, and the ventilation fan on top of the superstructure was relocated {{to the back of the}} fighting compartment. From March 1943, the driver's periscope was abandoned. In February 1943, Alkett was joined by MIAG as a second manufacturer. From May 1943, side hull spaced armour plates (Schürzen) were fitted to G models for added armour protection, particularly against Russian anti-tank rifles, but were also useful against hollow-charge ammunition. Side plates were retro-fitted to some Ausf. F/8 models, as they were to be fitted to all front line StuGs and other tanks by June 1943 in preparation for the battle of Kursk. Mountings for the Schürzen proved inadequately strong, as many were lost in the field. From March 1944, an improved mounting was introduced; as a result, side skirts are seen more often with late model Ausf G. From May 1943, 80 mm thick plates were used for frontal armour instead of two plates of 50 mm + 30 mm. However, a backlog of StuGs with completed 50 mm armour existed. For those, a 30 mm additional armour plate still had to be welded or bolted on, until October 1943.|$|R
40|$|Since the mid- 1990 ’s several {{claims for}} the return of the Mapungubwe human remains were made by {{indigenous}} communities, while some archaeologists felt that a pro-active process for repatriation should be initiated. The National Heritage Resource Act (Act 25 of 1999) made repatriation possible, but no regulations setting a procedure were promulgated. In 2004, Draft Regulations were circulated by the South African Heritage Resource Act. Comments raised in reply were used by the Department of Anatomy (UP) to develop a repatriation policy. During this time the Deputy Minister of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism was tasked by the President to arrange the repatriation of all the Mapungubwe remains (including associated sites). She established a Steering Committee consisting of various stakeholders: institutions holding remains, communities claiming the remains and Government institutions with a stake in heritage and conservation. Important compromises were achieved: although all Mapungubwe human remains were repatriated, they were buried in sealed containers in tomb structures on principal sites in hope that they would be well preserved and be available for future research. No samples for destructive analyses (DNA, chemical) prior to re-burial were, however, allowed. All the remains, apart from those from Schroda, were documented (Buikstra and Ubelaker, 1994). The remains were sealed in plastic bags and packed in high density foam in 143 PVC containers (one individual per <b>box)</b> which were <b>welded</b> shut to achieve an airtight seal. The involvement of politicians and government officials confounded the process (e. g., due to internal issues, the ceremonial part of the reburial was cancelled) and better results would have been achieved had the holding institutions followed a pro-active approach and initiated discussions with the claimant communities directly, rather than wait until they were forced to engage on politically motivated terms.
