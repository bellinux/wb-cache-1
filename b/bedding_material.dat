40|$|The {{objective}} of the work was to evaluate differences in agglomeration characteristics between commercially available alternative <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> and quartz-based <b>bed</b> <b>materials,</b> commonly used in fluidised bed combustion. Pure quartz <b>bed</b> <b>materials.</b> Magnesium oxide and foundry sand (natural sand with a clay coating) were used as alternative bed aterials. Carefully controlled bench-scale fluidised bed agglomeration experiments were performed, using calcium-rich bark and potassium-rich olive residue as model fuels with significantly different ash compositions, typical for forestry and griculture residues respectively. The resulting <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> particles and agglomerates were analysed with SEM/EDS. Analysis of <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> and agglomerates suggested that Mg and Al in the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> affect the agglomeration temperature positively for calcium-rich fuels. Al-rich foundry sand was found to decrease the agglomeration temperature in (Si, K) -rich systems. For combustion of olive residue in MgO bed, no attack layer was formed and agglomeration probably occurred via direct adhesion by partly melted alkali-silicates.

500|$|In the Sahara, {{breeding}} {{takes place}} in the hottest part of the summer on a stony desert plain. When choosing a nest site, the female scrapes several trial hollows before selecting one of them. The main criterion for selection seems to be the porous nature of the underlying rock. Spongy rock heats up less in the sun and provides a cool spot to nest. Also desirable are one or two [...] "cover stones" [...] close by, chosen because their dense structure attracts dew at night, moisture which drains into the soil and gets absorbed by the porous rock which helps keep the nest cool by day. The nest is made in a shallow depression in the ground without any <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> and two, occasionally three, eggs are laid. The eggs are elongated ovals in shape, buff with grey and brown blotches and speckles. Their colour and shape makes them difficult to distinguish from the pebbles lying around them. Both parents incubate the eggs and their cryptic colouration makes them almost invisible when sitting on the nest. The eggs hatch after about 20 days.|$|E

The model based on earlier work of the authors on heat transfer in single-phase fluid flow through packed beds, includes separation of the overall heat transfer coeffi-cien t in to conduction, convection and radia-tion contributions and their interactions. Numerical {{results indicate that the}} heat trans-fer rates increase with loading ratios and Reynolds number, as expected, but the increase varies with different <b>bed</b> <b>materials.</b> This dependence on the properties of the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> is discussed and predictions using the present model are compared with a correla-tion available in the literature. For the special case where the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> are the same, the literature correlation prediction and the present model agree and the differences obtained where other <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> are used further illustrates the importance of consider-ing the properties of the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> in evaluating the total heat transfer rates...|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{replenishment}} {{is one of}} {{the effective}} methods to prevent a sediment deficiency and detaching overgrowing algae in downstream reaches of dams. In this study, we examined the effect on a <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> size and algal biomass based on data measured in Futase dam. We assumed that algae detaches from the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> when the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> are moved by flow. So, threshold <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> size in motion Dcri for a given τ is calculated. The result showed that in winter, algal biomass was very high if flow was constantly low (No. 1). However, other result showed that the algal biomass was not so high if Dcri was temporally high (No. 2). This is probably because the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> of No. 2 were finer and easier to move by flow than those of No. 1. Thus, sediment replenishment promotes detachment of algae not only by enhancing sediment transport during major floods but also by covering riverbed with fine <b>materials</b> and reducing <b>bed</b> stability in winter...|$|R

These include eliminating overcrowding, not mixing pigs from different litters, providing straw or other <b>bedding</b> <b>material,</b> and providing sufficient food that not only meets nutritional needs but satisfies the appetite.

2500|$|The first {{engagement}} of the 155 L was probably by the 8th Foot Artillery Regiment firing from [...] during the Battle of the Mortagne on August 27. The first artillery duels {{of the war}} quickly convinced the French of their inferiority in heavy artillery relative to the Germans. [...] Thus it was seen necessary to enhance the mobility of their 155mm guns. In October 1914, a program was started to fit the 155 L wheels with a system of metallic soles and gutters articulated together. The use of this system—known as cingoli or Bonagente wheel belts after {{the name of their}} Italian inventor—eliminated the laborious construction of wooden platforms. The cingoli tracks added 800 kilograms to the gun's total weight, but saved 5 tons of <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> that otherwise had to be transported for the wooden platforms.

40|$|Dual Fluidized Bed (DFB) {{gasification}} is one {{alternative for}} the production of biofuels. In a DFB gasification process, the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> plays a crucial role. Primary role of the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> is to provide the heat needed for the gasification reaction. If the <b>bed</b> <b>material,</b> used in the system, is catalytically active it can improve the quality of the produced gas. In addition, inorganics originate from the biomass are retained in the system in the form of ash, which interacts with the <b>bed</b> <b>material,</b> thus representing catalytic potential. As a consequence of being circulated between oxidative and reductive environments, the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> releases some inorganics into the gas phase, thereby influencing the final composition of the produced gas. The goal of the present work is to increase our understanding as to how changes in the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> related to reactions with ash components can be utilized to improve the performance of the system. In this way, {{it should be possible to}} optimize the gasification step, thereby decreasing the cost of biofuel production. Moreover, by choosing naturally occurring <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> not only the cost of the process is decreased, but also negative impact on the environment which comes with the disposal of the material. This work deals with the application of catalytic <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> in dual fluidized bed systems, both as a primary measure in the gasification process itself and as a secondary measure for the reforming of the raw gas. Applied directly in the gasification step, the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> interacts with the inorganics derived from the fuel. As a result of this interaction, the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> changes its physical and chemical properties, which has impacts for the gasification process. In the present study, four naturally occurring materials were evaluated. In the Chalmers 2 – 4 -MWth gasifier, the effects on the gasification process of interactions between the ash and the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> were studied for quartz-sand and olivine. The effects on the process were evaluated with respect to: 1) the composition of the produced gas; 2) tar content; and 3) the physicochemical properties of the <b>bed</b> <b>material.</b> The studies yield information about the transport of inorganics between the reactors and their influences on the gas composition. Whereas the release of alkali during gasification implies a potential for enhancement of the gas quality, the presence of these same species represents a risk for agglomeration during combustion. In the Chalmers 12 –MWth boiler, ilmenite was tested as the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> and as an alkali getter material. The adsorption of potassium to the ilmenite is shown to be non-reversible, and ilmenite shows great promise as a <b>material</b> for decreasing <b>bed</b> agglomeration in fluidized bed boilers. As a secondary measure, downstream of the gasifier, manganese ore was evaluated for its tar-reforming capability in a dual fluidized bed reactor system, in a process known as chemical looping reforming. This material has the ability to reduce tar levels by as much as 72 %, while having high activity towards hydrogen production...|$|R
40|$|The {{most widely}} used <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> in the {{existing}} fluidized bed systems is silica sand. Upon burning fuels with high alkali content, such as biomass, in a bed of silica sand, alkali silicates are formed as molten glassy phase that easily stick and form agglomerates, defluidization of the reactor and unplanned operational stops. Several materials have been tested as alternative <b>bed</b> <b>materials,</b> often containing aluminate minerals. Due to the relatively high cost of such <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> the most dominant practice is still the use of silica sand even with high alkali fuels and the bed sintering is controlled by continuous replacement of the <b>bed</b> <b>material.</b> The present study investigates the possibility of mixing <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> and thereby optimizing the existing process by combining the low cost of silica sand with the sintering inhibiting properties of bauxite. Silica sand and bauxite were mixed in different ratios {{in a series of}} tests and were exposed to alkali compounds in a 12 MW boiler as well as in simplified experiments in a lab-scale furnace. The performance of the mixture of <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> was then evaluated based on the tendency to chemically interact with the alkali compounds, the formation of agglomerates and the effect on the overall performance of the reactor. Thermodynamic predictions of the expected compounds at the given conditions were also used to compare with the experimentally obtained results. It was observed that mixing <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> led to change in the observed mechanism of agglomeration and is beneficial for the fluidization. Furthermore, when calcium was present the amount of the formed alkali silicates and thereby the amount of agglomerates was decreased. It could be therewith shown that a significant improvement can be reached with existing <b>bed</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

Cottonseed meal, 1.5 {{million tons of}} which are produced in the U.S. every year, none of which is [...] suitable for humans or any other simple-stomach animals, is even cheaper than soybean meal. Historically, meat and bone meal, blood meal, and meat scraps have almost always commanded a higher price as a feed additive than oilseed meals in the U.S., so not much incentive existed to use animal products to feed ruminants. As a result, the use of animal byproduct feeds was never common, {{as it was in}} Europe. However, U.S. regulations only partially prohibited the use of animal byproducts in feed. In 1997, regulations prohibited the feeding of mammalian byproducts to ruminants such as cattle and goats. However, the byproducts of ruminants can still be legally fed to pets or other livestock, including pigs and poultry. In addition, it is legal for ruminants to be fed byproducts from some of these animals.

The concentration of carbon monoxide at 700 degreesC was higher than that at 800 and 900 degreesC. The influence of heat transfer efficiency on combustion efficiency was significant as the operating temperature was higher than 700 degreesC. The concentration of carbon monoxide decreased with increasing static bed height.
