Within this breed, an association was found between more intense seasonality and genotype -/- at a MnlI restriction site (allele 2 for its absence v. 1 for its presence) in Exon II of the MT 1 receptor gene. This study was designed to ascertain whether this association results in a direct effect of the MT 1 genotype on the expression of seasonality in MA ewes. In {{the first year of the}} study, genotyping of 314 MA ewes at locus MnlI was carried out and resulted in frequencies of 43. 0 %, 44. 9 % and 12. 1 % for genotypes +/+, +/- and -/-, respectively. The SOA of these ewes was determined in early April of two consecutive years by assaying plasma progesterone concentrations in two blood samples taken 9 days apart. Groups of 30 ewes of each homozygous genotype (+/+ and -/-) were identified from this population and their SOA was followed by taking blood samples at regular intervals between January and mid-April of the second and third year of the study. In the second year, groups of ewes were managed together on rangelands, whereas in the third year each group was split into two subgroups given differential feed levels. The results clearly showed that genotype had no significant effect on SOA during the 2 -to 3 -month period preceding the introduction of rams for spring mating. In the second year of the study, in which the experimental procedure allowed a fair comparison of the fertility of ewes in spring mating, fertility was similar for both genotypes. The reciprocity of the association was not demonstrated and the MnlI polymorphic site could not be used as a genetic marker of selection for out-of-season <b>breeding</b> <b>ability,</b> at least not in the MA breed. The percentage of cycling ewes significantly decreased between January and April, and older ewes (5 or 6 years old depending on the year of the study) were more cyclic than younger ones (2 and 3 years old, respectively).

Few pairs bred in 2011 - 2013 and almost no birds in juvenile plumage were seen. Long-term data suggest that poor breeding began in 1998. Lack of recruitment over this period {{would mean that the}} current population is mostly elderly and experiencing senescent decline in performance. Anthropogenic effects such as introduced predators are unlikely to explain this decline because islands with and without such factors exhibited the same low breeding. The poor reproduction seems to be linked to diet. Previous work indicated that sardine and herring (Clupeidae) supported successful breeding, but these fish were mostly absent from the diet during this study, except in the central part of Galápagos, where most breeding attempts during this study occurred. Elsewhere in the eastern Pacific sardine abundance has decreased dramatically by natural processes in the last 15 years, as part of a well-documented and apparently natural cycle. This cyclic change in abundance provides a possible explanation for the recent demographic changes in Blue-footed Boobies in Galápagos.

In the present study, a new three-dimensional (3 -D) neutronics calculation system has been developed for the helical-type reactor to enhance quick feedback between neutronics evaluation and design modification. Using this new calculation system, advanced Flibe-cooled and Li-cooled liquid blanket systems proposed for FFHR 2 have been evaluated to make clear design issues to enhance neutronics performance. Based on calculated results, modification of the blanket dimensions and configuration have been attempted to achieve the adequate tritium <b>breeding</b> <b>ability</b> and neutron shielding performance in the helical reactor. The total tritium breeding ratios (TBRs) obtained after modifying the blanket dimensions indicated that all the advanced blanket systems proposed for FFHR 2 would achieve adequate tritium self-sufficiency by dimension adjustment and optimization of structures in the breeder layers. Issues in neutron shielding performance have been investigated quantitatively using 3 -D geometry of the helical blanket system, support structures, poroidal coils etc. Shielding performance of the helical coils against direct neutrons from core plasma would achieve design target by further optimization of shielding materials. However, suppression of the neutron streaming and reflection through the divertor pumping areas in the original design is important issue to protect the poroidal coils and helical coils, respectively. Investigation of the neutron wall loading indicated that the peaking factor of the neutron wall load distribution would be moderated by the toroidal and helical effect of the plasma distribution in the helical reactor. ...|$|E
40|$|Breeding practices, {{evaluation}} of estrus synchronization and milk progesterone profile {{study was conducted}} in Sidama zone. The study was conducted at two agro ecological zones (highland and midland) of the zone to assess the prevailing cattle breeding practices. Data was collected using semi structured questionnaire and focus group discussion. A total of 180 respondents were randomly selected from the 9 kebeles and included in the study. The survey results indicated that the average age at first service for native and crossbred heifers were (42. 2 ± 4. 4 and 30. 3 ± 4. 4) months. The average age at first calving for native and crossbred was (51. 9 ± 5. 9 and 39. 3 ± 3. 9 months). Panmectic mating system was common in the study area. Most of the respondents do not own their own bulls but rely on the bulls owned by their acquaintances. The study further indicated that the respondents selected animals based on their higher milk yield, followed by <b>breeding</b> <b>ability,</b> growth rate and low intake of feed. There was lack of awareness among the respondents in estrus detection and time of insemination. Thus in most of the cases the AM/PM rule for insemination is not followed. Majority of the respondents were not satisfied with the results of the estrus synchronization and mass insemination (OSMI) program as the conception rate in the cattle was much below their expectation. The results pertaining to the {{evaluation of}} the synchronized cattle under the mass insemination program indicated that the estrus response interval differed (P< 0. 05) among the native and the crossbred cattle while the values were (68. 6 ± 1. 9) hours among the native and (56. 0 ± 2. 0) hours among the crossbred cattle. The average number of services per conception was higher among the native cattle (2. 4) when compared to that of the crossbreds (1. 83). However, the conception rate was higher among the crossbreds vis-a vis that of the native cattle. The results further indicate that the conception varied across the agro ecologies with the values being higher in the 1 st parity among the cattle reared in the midlands while the same was higher in the 2 nd parity among the cattle reared in the highlands. The body condition score was higher (P< 0. 05) among the cattle with exhibited better conception rate. Conception rate varied across the agro ecologies with higher rate of conception observed among the cattle reared in the highlands. Conception also varied across the age of the cow with higher values observed among those aged between 5 - 7 years or in the second parity. The optimum conception was observed among the cows inseminated between 10 - 15 hours after the onset of estrus. The rate of conception too varied (P< 0. 05) across the bulls whose semen was used to artificially inseminated cows. The rate of estrus response was higher in the action research when compared to those involved in the mass insemination. Pregnancy diagnosis following milk progesterone profile using Hormonst micro-lab farmer test kit indicated that most of the early embryonic mortalities were observed within 28 to 46 th days post insemination. The effect of genetic and non-genetic factors contributed to the success of conception in cattle.

In this study, {{the ability of a}} crop model to explain yield differences among genotypes in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of two-row harley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was explored. Yield and model-input traits of 94 RILs and their parents, 'Prisma' and 'Apex', were measured in field experiments conducted in Wageningen, Netherlands, in 1996 at low and in 1997 at high N levels. The major gene, denso, with the dwarfing allele from Prisma, was segregating in this population. Short denso RILs outyielded tall types in both years, and this yield advantage was stronger in 1997, largely because the tall genotypes lodged. A crop model based on existing routines for biomass production explained only 26 to 38 ␘f the yield variation among genotypes. The model, using input traits measured from the 1997 data, did not accurately predict growth of genotypes in 1996 because some traits varied with plant N status, which the model did not account for. Model analysis in the high-N environment showed that of the seven model-input traits examined, only lodging score, preflowering duration, and fraction of biomass partitioned to spikes had a significant effect on yield.

As the name suggests and as also mentioned by Wendell Levi in his book The Pigeon, this breed was developed {{in and around the}} City of Birmingham in England. The Birmingham Roller has a flying type and a show type. Show Rollers are larger than the flying variety, and are bred just for show. A similar breed called a Parlor Roller look much like Birmingham Rollers, but can't fly; rather, they spin backwards, somersaulting on the ground for many yards. Oriental Rollers are another aerial performer and come in many colour varieties. Some fanciers fly their rollers in competition, both locally and nationally. There is even a World Cup competition that includes several other countries. Kits (group of pigeons) are scored for quality and depth, as well as the number of birds that roll at the same time, referred to as a turn or break. The Birmingham Roller {{is a very}} popular breed of performing pigeon, with around 10,000 breeders worldwide.|$|R
50|$|When {{presented}} for grading and studbook inspection, the heavy-type Dole Gudbrandsdals are tested for pulling power and trotting. In the lighter type, x-rays showing {{the knee and}} lower legs {{to be free of}} defects must be presented, and stallions must have satisfactory results on the track before they may be used for breeding. However, three-year-old stallions may be issued temporary licenses before they begin their racing career if their conformation, <b>breeding,</b> and trotting <b>ability</b> are considered acceptable. Trotting-type mares with proper conformation that are not fast enough during grading may be registered as draft-type Doles. These strict and organized standards have improved the quality of the Dole breed over the past few decades. Although the Dole horse is one of the smallest draft breeds, it shows great pulling power, and is also hardy and agile. They are especially known for their excellent trots, as is shown by the lighter sub-type of the breed. During the late 20th century, interbreeding between the two types became quite common; due to this, the breed became much more uniform in type, with fewer differences between the trotter and draft sections.|$|R
40|$|Many {{diseases}} limit dry {{bean and}} snap bean yields. Common bacterial blight (CBB), caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli, {{is one of}} the most serious bacterial diseases in dry bean and snap bean that cause crop losses. Since there is no satisfactory chemical control, the use of resistant cultivars is an important control measure. Genetic studies of resistance are important for choosing appropriate <b>breeding</b> methods. Combining <b>ability</b> was determined for disease resistance in three snap bean genotypes (Alessa, Hab 52 and Hab 198) and two dry bean genotypes (Bac- 6 and A- 794). Plants were inoculated with highly pathogenic isolate CNF 15, using a razor blade procedure in leaves and needle punctures in pods. They were evaluated 7 days after inoculation. Leaves were evaluated on a 1 to 5 scale and pods by lesion diameter. Diallel analysis was conducted using Griffing's model. General combining ability (GCA) was significant for both leaf and pod infection, whereas specific combining ability (SCA) was significant for disease reaction in pods. Bac- 6 and A- 794 were considered superior genotypes for leaf resistance. Nonadditive effects were predominant in pod reactions, and Alessa x Bac- 6, Alessa x A- 794 and Hab 52 x Bac- 6 were the best combinations...|$|R
40|$|Genomic {{selection}} offers {{great potential}} {{to increase the}} rate of genetic improvement in plant <b>breeding</b> programs. The <b>ability</b> to accurately impute missing genotypes for {{a large number of}} individuals, screened with low marker density, at low cost is crucial for achieving this. In this research an existing general algorithm for tracing allele inheritance in known pedigrees was modified to enable genotype imputation in specific crosses (biparental, backcross, and topcross) that are common in plant breeding. The extension was tested with a series of representative simulated examples of these crosses. The results show success of imputation is affected by many factors including the number of low-density markers per cM, level of inbreeding or intercrossing of the individuals to have genotypes imputed, level of inbreeding of the parents of a cross, and genome length; but not by the number of high-density markers or by the interaction between the genome length and the number of low-density markers. With as few as one or two markers per 20 cM genotype imputation was successful when parents were inbred. Therefore, genotyping strategies in which inbred parents of a cross are genotyped at high-density and their descendants are genotyped with 200 to 400 markers genome wide may be cost effective and useful in practical plant breeding programs that utilize genomic selection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In colonially <b>breeding</b> birds, the <b>ability</b> to {{discriminate}} between individuals is often essential. During post-fledging care, parents have to recognize their own offspring among many other unrelated chicks in the breeding colony. It {{is well known that}} fledglings and food-provisioning parents of many bird species use contact calls to convey their identity. These calls are also often used as hunger-related signals of need in young birds. Here, we investigate how such calls incorporate signals of need {{and at the same time}} act as reliable indicators of each chick's identity. Results In a field study, we experimentally manipulated the hunger level of colonially breeding Jackson's golden-backed weaver (Ploceus jacksoni) nestlings close to fledging and investigated its effects on acoustic call parameters. Some acoustic parameters that were related to the time-frequency pattern showed high individuality and were largely unaffected by a nestling's state of hunger. However, the majority of call parameters were significantly affected by hunger. Interestingly, most of these acoustic parameters showed both consistent changes with hunger and high between-individual differences, i. e. potential for individual recognition. Conclusion The results indicate that individual recognition processes can be based on static, hunger-independent call parameters, but also on dynamic hunger-related parameters that show high individuality. Furthermore, these signal properties suggest that the assessment of signals of need can be improved if the signal value is referenced to a chick's vocal spectrum. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Japanese apple {{industry}} developed {{following the}} importation of 75 cultivars from America in 1871. Ralls Janet and Jonathan had been the leading cultivars until the 1960 s, when those cultivars were replaced by Starking Delicious and Fuji. Starking Delicious had the greatest production in the 1970 s, but its production rapidly decreased after 1980 due to short shelf life. Fuji was introduced in 1962 and continues to increase its production. Fuji is now the leading cultivar and is grown on 48 % of the apple orchard area in Japan. Fuji was selected from 787 hybrid seedlings of Ralls Janet and Delicious. Fuji fruits are medium to large size, red striped, firm, crisp, very sweet and very juicy. Fruit matures in early or mid-November and often develops water core. Trees are large, spreading, vigorous and productive. The original seedling tree of Fuji still produces fruits {{every year in the}} orchard of the Apple Research Center at Morioka. Apple breeding in Japan is popular in each apple growing prefecture. Relatively large breeding programs are located in three regions, the Apple Research Center at Morioka, the Aomori Apple Experiment Station and the Nagano Fruit Tree Experiment Station. Fuji is {{regarded as one of the}} important parents for apple <b>breeding.</b> Long keeping <b>ability</b> and sweetness of Fuji have been inherited by its children and grandchildren (first generation and second generation seedlings) ...|$|R
