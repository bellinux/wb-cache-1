Our protocol, Explicit Synchronization via Intelligent Feedback (ESIF), uses feedback from neighboring nodes to synchronize data communication at multiple beams. ESIF exploits routing information to guarantee long-term fairness and minimize the energy and latency overheads. Unlike previous works on directional antennas that discuss range extension, we focus on optimal spatial reuse.

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{presents}} a {{detailed discussion of}} various issues involved in designing a medium access control (MAC) protocol for multihop wireless networks with nodes employing multiple <b>beam</b> smart <b>antennas.</b> Multiple <b>beam</b> smart <b>antennas</b> can form several beams simultaneously and can initiate concurrent transmissions or receptions in them, thereby increasing the throughput of the bottleneck nodes. Traditional on-demand MAC protocols for omnidirectional and single <b>beam</b> directional <b>antennas</b> based on the IEEE 802. 11 distributed coordination function (DCF) mechanism cannot {{take advantage of this}} unique capability of multiple <b>beam</b> <b>antennas</b> as they do not facilitate concurrent transmissions or receptions by a node. This paper introduces a novel protocol, hybrid MAC (HMAC), which enables concurrent packet reception (CPR) and concurrent packet transmission (CPT) at a node equipped with multiple <b>beam</b> <b>antennas</b> and is backward compatible with IEEE 802. 11 DCF. Simulation results show the superior performance of HMAC in most ad hoc scenarios. Moreover, in some sample topologies, the throughput of HMAC is close to the theoretical maximum.

The processor installed on the ASR-9 was far more advanced than processors that had been used on previous models. Some of the major areas that the digital processor was superior to earlier versions, the use of an optimum clutter filter bank, a fine-grained ground mapping threshold and mean level thresholding on the weather bands. Combining all of the upgraded components, the ASR-9 provided a significantly improved ability to detect aircraft in the presence of ground clutter, or weather clutter such as torrential rains. The new and improved processor on the ASR-9 also enhances the ability to detect hazardous weather conditions that could affect flight, landing and take off of various aircraft. A new solid state design and Remote Maintenance Monitoring significantly improved the overall availabilities of the ASR-9, as well as lowering the monthly operation costs.|$|E

Advanced transmission antenna technology is critical to generate and switch narrow beams rapidly among {{a large number of}} users under quality of service (QoS) constraints such as average delay. In this paper, we jointly optimize resource allocation and congestion control, and compare the performances of two types of satellite transmit antennas: a multiple <b>beam</b> <b>antenna</b> and a phased array antenna. For a multiple <b>beam</b> <b>antenna</b> with traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTA), throughput is decided by either the most demanding user or the average of all user parameters. For a phased array antenna, joint antenna gain patterning and beam scheduling is given as a function of channel conditions, interference (depending on users' geographical distribution), and average delay requirements. We then develop a low-complexity on-line algorithm of choosing either interference suppression or sequential service for the active users who are closely located within the width of a spotbeam. Due to flexible power allocation, the phased array antenna can provide better performance than the multiple <b>beam</b> <b>antenna</b> when a small number of users are very demanding or many users are densely crowded in a small area.
