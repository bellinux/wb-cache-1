[...] "And if you look at the cutbacks in Hollywood, being on a soap is not of any less or more value than being in any other medium at this time." [...] Another factor that contributed to his decision to join All My Children was the actors strike. He intended to stay on All My Children for a year. That year turned into more because the actor fell in love with New York.|$|E

The best known is his equestrian portrait of John Hawkwood on the wall of Florence Cathedral. <b>Both</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> on the four heads of prophets that he painted around the inner clockface in the cathedral, he used strongly contrasting tones, suggesting that each figure was being lit by a natural light source, as if the source was an actual window in the cathedral.|$|E

Georgescu had more ambitious goals: He wanted to overturn and replace the existing, but flawed, mainstream paradigm of neoclassical economics with his own 'bioeconomics' (see below); to downscale (degrow) the economy as soon as possible (see below); and not merely be relegated to some arcane and insignificant — so he believed — economics subdiscipline such as ecological economics.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Max Harris {{and other}} Angry Penguins writers {{represent}} an Australian outcrop {{of a literary}} fashion which has become prominent in England and America. The distinctive feature of the fashion, it seemed to us, was that it rendered its devotees insensible of absurdity and incapable of ordinary discrimination.

2500|$|The town of Patambán in the {{southwest}} of the lake area makes a green glaze ware, which is distinguished {{by the quality of}} the glaze and the fine clay used. Even the bottoms of the pieces are glazed and have designs. Most of the forms are for common use such as little mugs, pitchers plates and platters.

[...] One form that is found <b>both</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> neighboring San José de Gracia is a water jar {{in the shape of a}} pineapple. The body is entirely covered in small conical lumps placed by hand. These jars range from one cup to five gallons in size. The lid is decorated with a representation of the spikey crown of the fruit. Most of these are also covered in Patambán's green glaze but a brown glaze version also exists. One other vessel this town makes along with Huantzio is a large-bellied water container with a small neck. These are not glazed in green but rather covered with a red slip and burnished. They are then decorated with black and white horizontal bands interspersed with rabbits, birds and flowers. Huanzito often uses a blue and green color scheme as well.|$|E
