The object of this survey has been to answer the question if it is possible to have a balanced <b>bipolar</b> <b>transmission</b> without a return conductor and during a trip of one pole control it as an HVDC transmission with series connected converters by adding the by-pass switches and the logic for a series connected HVDC converter system which means that a shutdown of the transferred power during the transition phases is not necessary. The survey has been performed with the software PSCAD where an already existing series connected converter circuit had been modified to a bipolar system and the control logic for the transition phases has been created. There were some problems with various control signals between the software HiDraw and PSCAD, this was solved by different methods and the result shows {{that it is possible to}} have a transition between bipolar operation and monopolar operation with metallic return without the need to totally shut down the power transfer completely.

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{possible}} to load the transmission lines very close to their thermal limits by allowing the conductors to carry usual ac along with dc super imposed on it. The added dc power flow does not cause any transient instability. This project gives the feasibility of converting a double circuit ac line into composite ac–dc power transmission line to get the advantages of parallel ac–dc transmission to improve stability and damping out oscillations. Simulation and experimental studies are carried out for the coordinated control as well as independent control of ac and dc power transmissions. No alterations of conductors, insulator strings, and towers of the original line are needed. The present situation demands the review of traditional power transmission theory and practice, on the basis of new concepts that allow full utilization of existing transmission facilities without decreasing system availability and security. To achieve this is by simultaneous ac–dc power transmission in which the conductors are allowed to carry superimposed dc current along with ac current. Ac and dc power flow independently, and the added dc power flow does not cause any transient instability. Simultaneous ac–dc power transmission was first proposed through a single circuit ac transmission line. In these proposals Mono-polar dc transmission with ground as return path was used. There were certain limitations due to use of ground as return path. Moreover, the instantaneous value of each conductor voltage with respect to ground becomes higher by the amount of the dc voltage, and more discs are to be added in each insulator string to withstand this increased voltage. In this paper, the feasibility study of conversion of a double circuit ac line to composite ac–dc line without altering the original line conductors, tower structures, and insulator strings has been presented. In this scheme, the dc power flow is point-to point <b>bipolar</b> <b>transmission</b> system. The novelty of our proposed scheme is that the power transfer enhancement is achieved without any alteration in the existing EHV ac line.

50|$|HVDC {{electrodes}} {{are used}} in most <b>bipolar</b> HVDC <b>transmission</b> systems {{as a means to}} improve the reliability of the entire system. In the event that one of the poles in the bipolar system is faulted, the current path will switch to ground return, thus allowing the system to continue operating at reduced capacity and reducing the possibility that a pole fault will cause a bipolar outage. Usually these ground return paths are only used for very short durations until the faulted pole can be returned to service. The ground current in such schemes can flow in either direction, and the electrodes have to be designed to be reversible, operating either as an anode or cathode.|$|R
30|$|In [18] and [19], the transient-energy based {{protection}} {{methods are}} proposed for HVDC line, which can identify an {{internal or external}} fault by comparing the amplitudes of the transient energies {{on both ends of}} the line, these methods are similar to the current differential protection, and they need strict data synchronization. Different from the aforementioned methods, this paper presents a novel directional pilot protection method based on the polarity characteristic of transient energy. For a fault inside the DC line, the transient energies detected on both sides of HVDC line are negative; while the transient energy on one side is positive, and that on the other side is negative for an external fault. On the basis of this fact, an integral criterion identifying the fault direction is constructed. By analyzing the fault directions on both sides, the internal fault can be discriminated from the external fault. Due to only using the directional information, the proposed protection method does not require the synchronous data at all. To verify the performance of the proposed method, a <b>bipolar</b> HVDC <b>transmission</b> system model is built, and extensive simulations are carried out.|$|R

Polymorphism at dopamine receptor genes DRD 2, DRD 4, and dopamine and serotonin transporter genes (DAT, SERT) {{has been used in}} previous association studies. Some authors have reported positive association between certain alleles and bipolar disorder, using the case-control design. In this family-based association study of DRD 2, DRD 4, DAT, and SERT, the distribution of parental nontransmitted alleles was compared with that of alleles transmitted to 53 Sardinian probands suffering from <b>bipolar</b> disorder. The <b>transmission</b> disequilibrium test (TDT) was used to detect any disproportionate transmission of alleles by heterozygous parents to affected children. No {{differences were found between the}} allele distribution of polymorphisms at DRD 2, DRD 4, DAT, and SERT in probands and parental nontransmitted chromosomes. TDT did not reveal any difference between transmitted and nontransmitted alleles. Our results do not support the hypothesis of a role for DRD 2, DRD 4, DAT, or SERT in bipolar disorder. Previously reported positive associations between DRD 2 or SERT and bipolar disorder were conceivably due to stratification dependent on the case-control design, even though our sample might have failed to detect small associations due to limited power. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the properties of}} glycine receptors and glycinergic synaptic inputs at the axon terminals of rod bipolar cells (RBCs) in rats by patch-clamp recording. Glycine currents recorded from isolated axon terminals were larger than those from isolated somata/dendrites; this was confirmed by puffing glycine onto these two regions in retinal slices. The current density at terminal endings {{was more than one}} order of magnitude higher than the density at somatic/dendritic regions. Glycine currents from isolated terminals and isolated somata/dendrites showed similar sensitivity to picrotoxinin blockade. Single-channel opening recorded from isolated terminals and somata/dendrites displayed a similar main-state conductance of ≈ 46 pS. Application of glycine effectively suppressed depolarization-evoked increases in intracellular Ca 2 + at the terminals. In the presence of GABAA and GABAC antagonists, strychnine-sensitive chloride currents were evoked in RBCs in retinal slices by puffing kainate onto the inner plexiform layer. No such currents were observed if the recorded RBCs did not retain axon terminals or if Ca 2 + was replaced by Co 2 + in the extracellular solution. The currents displayed discrete miniature-like events, which were partially blocked by tetrodotoxin. Consistent with early studies in the rabbit and mouse, this study demonstrates that glycine receptors are highly concentrated at the axon terminals of rat RBCs. The pharmacological and physiological properties of glycine receptors located in the axon terminal and somatic/dendritic regions, however, appear to be the same. This study provides evidence for the existence of functional glycinergic synaptic input at the axon terminals of RBCs, suggesting that glycine receptors {{may play a role in}} modulating <b>bipolar</b> cell synaptic <b>transmission...</b>|$|R
40|$|Presynaptic {{transmitter}} release {{has mostly}} been studied through measurements of postsynaptic responses, {{but a few}} synapses offer {{direct access to the}} presynaptic terminal, thereby allowing capacitance measurements of exocytosis. For mammalian rod <b>bipolar</b> cells, synaptic <b>transmission</b> has been investigated in great detail by recording postsynaptic currents in AII amacrine cells. Presynaptic measurements of the dynamics of vesicular cycling have so far been limited to isolated rod bipolar cells in dissociated preparations. Here, we first used computer simulations of compartmental models of morphologically reconstructed rod bipolar cells to adapt the ‘Sine + DC’ technique for capacitance measurements of exocytosis at axon terminals of intact rod bipolar cells in retinal slices. In subsequent physiological recordings, voltage pulses that triggered presynaptic Ca 2 + influx evoked capacitance increases that were proportional to the pulse duration. With pulse durations ≤ 100 ms, the increase saturated at ∼ 10 fF, corresponding {{to the size of a}} readily releasable pool of vesicles. Pulse durations ≥ 400 ms evoked additional capacitance increases, probably reflecting recruitment from additional pools of vesicles. By using Ca 2 + tail current stimuli, we separated Ca 2 + influx from Ca 2 + channel activation kinetics, allowing us to estimate the intrinsic release kinetics of the readily releasable pool, yielding a time constant of ∼ 1. 1 ms and a maximum release rate of 2 – 3 vesicles (release site) − 1 ms− 1. Following exocytosis, we observed endocytosis with time constants ranging from 0. 7 to 17 s. Under physiological conditions, it is likely that release will be transient, with the kinetics limited by the activation kinetics of the voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels...|$|R
