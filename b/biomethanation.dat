40|$|Food waste (FW) {{has a high}} {{content of}} water and is easily biodegradable; thus its {{treatment}} through anaerobic digestion (AD) is an attractive method. Even though theoretically thermophilic AD is preferred over mesophilic AD due to higher rate of organic solids destruction and <b>biomethanation,</b> as well as higher reduction of pathogens, most anaerobic digesters are operated under mesophilic conditions as the operational parameters such as cost, process stability, and structural requirements are simpler. In order to reach the advantages of both mesophilic and thermophilic AD processes, thermophilic/hyperthermophilic hydrolysis can be performed prior to mesophilic <b>biomethanation</b> in the same digester. Therefore, this research aims at investigating the effect of thermophilic/hyperthermophilic pretreatment on mesophilic <b>biomethanation</b> of FW through batch experiments.

40|$|<b>Biomethanation</b> is {{a process}} by which organic {{material}} is microbiologically converted under anaerobic conditions to biogas. Three main physiological groups of microorganisms are involved: fermenting bacteria, organic acid oxidizing bacteria, and methanogenic archaea. Microorganisms degrade organic matter via cascades of biochemical conversions to methane and carbon dioxide. Syntrophic relationships between hydrogen producers (acetogens) and hydrogen scavengers (homoacetogens, hydrogenotrophic methanogens, etc.) are critical to the process. Determination of practical and theoretical methane potential {{is very important for}} design for optimal process design, configuration, and effective evaluation of economic feasibility. A wide variety of process applications for <b>biomethanation</b> of wastewaters, slurries, and solid waste have been developed.

Moreover, long-term batch digestion studies showed that the rate of <b>biomethanation</b> in a continuously stirred digester was inferior to that of a non-stirred one.

MSW is a chronic problem in Saudi Arabia and more specifically in Saudi Urban areas. The MSW practices in KSA are simply done by collecting the waste and dumping it in open landfill sites. KSA is considering WTE as a potential renewable energy source that can contribute to electricity demand in the Kingdom. This research aims to assess potential contribution of WTE facility to meet electricity demand in the three main cities in the Western Province of Saudi Arabia and to provide an alternative solution to landfills. Three scenarios for WTE utilization were developed: Mass Burn, Mass Burn with recycling, and refused derived fuel (RDF) with <b>biomethanation.</b> The Mass Burn scenario implies full waste stream incineration; the Mass Burn with recycling scenario considers segregation of reusable materials and the waste leftover for incineration; while RDF with <b>biomethanation</b> considers segregation of general waste stream into inorganic and organic waste and utilizes organic waste for <b>biomethanation</b> and inorganic for RDF.

Sequential increases in the chemostat dilution rate demonstrated excellent <b>biomethanation</b> performance at retention times as low as 25 h. Retention times shorter than 25 h caused prevalent bacterial populations and methane production to decrease, and intermediary carbon metabolites accumulated in the following order: acetate, butyrate, propionate, lactate, ethanol, and lactose.

Three dominant bacterial trophic group populations were present (in most probable number per milliliter) whose species numbers varied with the substrate consumed: hydrolytic, 1010; acetogenic, 107 to 1010; and methanogenic, 106 to 109.

The reactors supplemented with ferric oxyhydroxide (R 2) and magnetite (R 3) showed significantly enhanced <b>biomethanation</b> performance {{compared with the}} control (R 1). The removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) after 30 days was 31. 9, 59. 3, and 82. 5 % in R 1, R 2, and R 3, respectively. The consumed COD was almost fully recovered as biogas in R 2 and R 3, while only 79 % was recovered in R 1. The total energy production as biogas was accordingly 32. 2, 71. 0, and 97. 7 kJ in R 1, R 2, and R 3, respectively. The reactors also differed in the acid formation profile with more propionate and butyrate found in R 1 and more acetate found in R 3. The enhanced <b>biomethanation</b> seems {{to be associated with}} variations in the bacterial community structure supposedly induced by the ferric oxides added. In contrast, no evident variation was observed in the archaeal community structure among the reactors. The potential electric syntrophy formed between Methanosaeta concilii-like methanogens and electroactive iron-reducing bacteria, particularly Trichococcus, was likely responsible for the enhanced performance. The stimulated growth of fermentative iron reducers may also have contributed by altering the metabolic characteristics of the bacterial communities to produce more favorable acidogenic products for methanogenesis. The overall results suggest the potential of biostimulation with (semi) conductive ferric oxides to enhance the rate and efficiency of the <b>biomethanation</b> of organic wastes.

40|$|Residential {{bioenergy}} {{consumption and}} bioenergy resources based on by-products of residential agricultural production and animal husbandry have been analyzed statistically, {{based on a}} nationwide residential livelihood and energy survey conducted in Cambodia in 2009. Furthermore, the potential for <b>biomethanation,</b> residential biogas consumption and small-scale power generation for non-electrified rural areas has been assessed. Household potential of biogas substrates in Cambodia, based on nationally representative data has not been presented earlier. This paper proposes mixtures of substrates for biogas production for various livelihood zones of Cambodia. The occurrence of biomass suitable for <b>biomethanation</b> is most favorable in unelectrified rural areas, except for fishing villages. The theoretical daily biogas potential from animal dung and rice husk appears to be promising for households in unelectrified rural villages, both for household digesters and units designed for small-scale electricity generation. Theoretical CH 4 content of biogas was 63. 9 % and specific biogas yield 0. 41 Nm 3 /kg for households in unelectrified villages. Based on the survey, the energy content of biogas potential is 25. 5 PJ per year. This study shows that biogas has nationally significant technical potential in Cambodia...|$|E
40|$|About 40 {{million tonnes}} of {{municipal}} waste is generated in India every year. The waste management scenario {{continues to be}} grim, even though {{there have been some}} commendable initiatives by scattered municipalities, individuals, groups and NGOs. As of today, open dumps are the major mode of waste disposal. Composting, <b>biomethanation</b> and thermal processing are being attempted as the options for waste processing. This paper analyses the performance of such waste processing initiatives in India, identifies the key constraints and presents suggestions for improvement...|$|E
