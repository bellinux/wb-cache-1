5|$|<b>Highland</b> <b>cattle</b> {{were first}} {{imported}} into Canada in the 1880s. Both the Honourable Donald A. Smith, Lord Strathcona of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Robert Campbell of Strathclair, Manitoba, imported one bull each. There were also <b>Highland</b> <b>cattle</b> in Nova Scotia, Canada, in the 1880s. However, their numbers were small until the 1920s when large-scale breeding and importing began. In the 1950s cattle were imported from and exported to North America. The Canadian <b>Highland</b> <b>Cattle</b> Society was officially registered in 1964 and currently registers all purebred cattle in Canada. Towards {{the end of}} the 1990s, there was a large semen and embryo trade between the UK and Canada. However, that has stopped, largely due to the BSE (mad cow disease) outbreaks in the United Kingdom. Today, <b>Highland</b> <b>cattle</b> are mainly found in eastern Canada. The population of <b>Highland</b> <b>cattle</b> for Canada and the United States of America combined is estimated at 11,000.|$|R

5|$|<b>Highland</b> <b>cattle</b> {{were first}} {{imported}} into Australia by {{the mid-19th century}} by Scottish migrants such as Chieftain Areneas Ronaldson MacDonell of Glengarry, Scotland. Arriving in Port Albert, Victoria, in 1841 with his clan, they apparently drove their <b>Highland</b> <b>cattle</b> to a farm at Greenmount, on the Tarra River, preceded by a piper. Samuel Amess, also from Scotland, who made a fortune in the Victorian goldfields and became Mayor of Melbourne in 1869, kept a small fold of black <b>Highland</b> <b>cattle</b> on Churchill Island. They were seen and survived in Port Victoria during the late 1800s, but other folds were believed to have died out {{in areas such as}} New South Wales. In 1988 the Australian <b>Highland</b> <b>Cattle</b> Society was formed. Since then, numbers have been growing and semen is being exported to New Zealand to establish the breed there.|$|R

5|$|The meat of <b>Highland</b> <b>cattle</b> {{tends to}} be leaner than most beef because Highlands are largely {{insulated}} by their thick, shaggy hair rather than by subcutaneous fat. <b>Highland</b> <b>cattle</b> can produce beef at a reasonable profit from land that would otherwise normally be unsuitable for agriculture.

The meat is also gaining popularity in North America as the beef is low in cholesterol.|$|R
