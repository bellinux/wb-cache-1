40|$|Abstract. Reverse Engineering (RE), as the {{important}} {{technology for learning}} and mastering the advanced technology, as well as shortening the period of product design and development, has already become the highlight in the manufacturing industry. But there are some inner un-measurable parts, like couplers. The inner form information of the coupler {{can not be fully}} captured without any cutting, {{which is one of the}} bottlenecks in RE. Therefore, an effective method needs to be explored for reconstructing lumen model. Taking model reconstruction of coupler lumen as a case, an assembly reverse method is proposed by analyzing the parts functions and restraint relations in coupler. The method in detail is that, firstly, all parts are assembled in the coupler <b>body</b> <b>lumen,</b> then, according to assembly relations and the enveloping space determined by movement scope of individual parts, the coupler lumen shape can be obtained. The method proposed is successfully applied in model reconstruction of heavy haul coupler, and which provides a common solution of model reconstruction for inner un-measurable parts...|$|E

40|$|Arsenophonus nasoniae, a male-killing endosymbiont of chalcid wasps, was {{recently}} detected in several hard tick species. Following {{the hypothesis that}} its presence in ticks may not {{be linked to the}} direct occurrence of bacteria in tick's organs, we identified A. nasoniae in wasps emerging from parasitised nymphs. We confirmed that 28. 1 % of Ixodiphagus hookeri wasps parasitizing Ixodes ricinus ticks were infected by A. nasoniae. Moreover, in examined I. ricinus nymphs, A. nasoniae was detected only in those, which were parasitized by the wasp. However, in part of the adult wasps as well as in some ticks that contained wasp's DNA, we did not confirm A. nasoniae. We also found, that in spite of reported male-killing, some newly emerged adult wasp males were also infected by A. nasoniae. Additionally, we amplified the DNA of Rickettsia helvetica and Rickettsia monacensis (known to be Ixodes ricinus-associated bacteria) in adult parasitoid wasps. This may be related either with the digested bacterial DNA in wasp <b>body</b> <b>lumen</b> or with a role of wasps in circulation of rickettsiae among tick vectors...|$|E
40|$|In the {{flagellate}} green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii the Ca 2 +-binding EF-hand protein centrin is encoded by a single-copy gene. Previous {{studies have}} localized the protein to four distinct {{structures in the}} flagellar apparatus: the nucleus-basal body connector, the distal connecting fiber, the flagellar transitional region, and the axoneme. To explain the disjunctive distribution of centrin, the interaction of centrin with as yet unknown specific centrin-binding proteins has been implied. Here, we demonstrate using serial section postembedding immunoelectron microscopy of isolated cytoskeletons that centrin is located in additional structures (transitional fibers and basal <b>body</b> <b>lumen)</b> and that the centrin-containing structures of the basal apparatus are likely part of a continuous filamentous scaffold that extends from the nucleus to the flagellar bases. In addition, we show that centrin {{is located in the}} distal lumen of the basal body in a rotationally asymmetric structure, the V-shaped filament system. This novel centrin-containing structure has also been detected near the distal end of the probasal bodies. Taken together, these results suggest a role for a rotationally asymmetric centrin “seed” in the growth and development of the centrin scaffold following replication of the basal apparatus...|$|E
40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is {{a chronic}} inherited disease affec-ting more than 30, 000 {{children and adults}} in the United States and 80, 000 people worldwide. 1 It is a multisystem disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding CF trans-membrane conductance regulator (CFTR). 2 CFTR is a pro-tein involved in the transport of chloride ions across cell membranes or the gene that encodes this protein. It is pre-sent in the epithelium {{of most of the}} <b>body</b> <b>lumen</b> and reg-ulates the sodium and water balance. A dysfunction of this subtle balance severely affects the airway epithelium, in-creases viscosity of the mucous, and in turn, causes a reduc-tion in the mucociliary clearance, which consequently leads to bacterial retention. CF most commonly leads to pancre-atic insufficiency, electrolyte imbalance, gastrointestinal manifestations, elevated sweat and chloride levels, infer-tility in males, and obstructive sinopulmonary disease. 2 - 4 Chronic sinusitis associated with CF has a different un-derlying pathophysiology as described above. Nishioka et al found {{a significant difference in the}} appearance of the paranasal sinuses on computed tomography (CT), such as agenesis of the frontal sinus, medial bulging, and extensive maxilloethmoidal opacification in CF patients as compar-ed to non-CF patients. 5 However, CT can only determine the extent of opacification and cannot differentiate between thickened mucosa and pus. 6 Eggesbø et al assessed the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by utilizing short inversion time inversion recovery (STIR) and T 1 -weighted sequences and found three major patterns in the maxillary sinus lumen: air-filled, oval pus-filled, and streak-shaped pus-filled lumen. 6 Long-standing inflammation caused by sinonasal poly-posis and sinusitis when involving the adjacent bony frame-work of the paranasal sinuses leads to localized osteitis. This osteitis coupled with chronic rhinosinusitis is known as osteitic rhinosinusitis.

30|$|During cell division, a {{subpopulation}} of proteins, RNAs, {{and other}} macromolecules in mother cells are inherited unequally into two daughter cells (Betschinger & Knoblich 2004; Goldstein & Macara 2007; Suzuki & Ohno 2006). Unequally distributed cellular components include fate determinants {{that govern the}} fates of two daughter cells. Prior to asymmetric division, these fate determinants are differentially enriched at either of the apical or basal pole, in which the mitotic spindle apparatus and centrosomes are unequally aligned. Proteins that promote self-renewal and stemness are recruited to the spindle apparatus at the apical side which typically faces {{the outside of the}} <b>body</b> or the <b>lumen</b> of internal cavities. In contrast, differentiation-promoting factors are recruited to the mitotic spindle located at the basal side toward the basement membrane.|$|R
50|$|Epithelial cells {{adhere to}} one another through tight junctions, desmosomes and adherens junctions, forming sheets of cells that line {{the surface of the}} animal body and {{internal}} cavities (e.g., digestive tract and circulatory system). These cells have an apical-basal polarity defined by the apical membrane facing the outside surface of the <b>body,</b> or the <b>lumen</b> of internal cavities, and the basolateral membrane oriented away from the lumen. The basolateral membrane refers to both the lateral membrane where cell-cell junctions connect neighboring cells and to the basal membrane where cells are attached to the basement membrane, a thin sheet of extracellular matrix proteins that separates the epithelial sheet from underlying cells and connective tissue. Epithelial cells also exhibit planar cell polarity,in which specialized structures are orientated within the plane of the epithelial sheet. Some examples of planar cell polarity include the scales of fish being oriented in the same direction and similarly the feathers of birds, the fur of mammals, and the cuticular projections (sensory hairs, etc.) on the bodies and appendages of flies and other insects.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{ingestion}} of foreign bodies {{is a frequent}} occurrence, especially among children. The majority of these objects travel safely through the gastrointestinal tract, without causing symptoms or leaving sequelae. Acute appendicitis is the emergency surgical pathology of greater prevalence. However, the impaction of a foreign body into the appendicular lumen as an etiologic agent of appendicitis is a very rare event. CASE REPORT: We describe {{the case of a}} 21 -year-old male patient with lower abdominal pain over approximately six days, in association with vomiting, fever and abdominal distension. After imaging studies, a radiopaque foreign body was identified in a pelvic topography, with distention and air-fluid levels in intestinal loops. Our patient was submitted to an open appendectomy, evidencing acute perforated appendicitis and the presence of two foreign <b>bodies</b> in its <b>lumen.</b> The patient progressed satisfactorily in the post-operative period, with use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. DISCUSSION: Foreign bodies impacted in the gastrointestinal tract are usually removed by endoscopic techniques. When these bodies cause infections, there should be a resolution, preferably by surgical laparoscopy, which will serve both for diagnostic as therapeutic purposes...|$|R
40|$|Burkholderia cenocepacia AU 1054 is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen {{isolated from}} the blood of a person with cystic fibrosis. AU 1054 is a multihost pathogen causing rapid pathogenicity to Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. Within 24 h, AU 1054 causes greater than 50 % mortality, reduced growth, emaciated <b>body,</b> distended intestinal <b>lumen,</b> rectal swelling, and prolific infection of the nematode intestine. To determine virulence mechanisms, 3, 000 transposon mutants were screened for attenuated virulence in nematodes. Fourteen virulence-attenuated mutants were isolated, and the mutant genes were identified. These genes included paaA, previously identified as being required for full virulence of B. cenocepacia K 56 - 2. Six mutants were restored in virulence by complementation with their respective wild-type gene. One of these contained an insertion in gspJ, predicted to encode a pseudopilin component of the type 2 secretion system (T 2 SS). Nematodes infected with AU 1054 gspJ had fewer bacteria present in the intestine than those infected with the wild type but still showed rectal swelling. The gspJ mutant was also defective in pathogenicity to onion and in degradation of polygalacturonic acid and casein. This result differs from previous studies where no or little role was found for T 2 SS in Burkholderia virulence, although virulence factors such as zinc metalloproteases and polygalacturonase {{are known to be}} secreted by the T 2 SS. This study highlights strain specific differences in B. cenocepacia virulence mechanisms important for understanding what enables environmental microbes to function as opportunistic pathogens...|$|R
40|$|Intestinal {{epithelial}} cells are {{located at the}} interface between the external environment and {{the inside of the}} <b>body.</b> The gut <b>lumen</b> contains nutrients indispensable for body growth and maintenance, the gut microbiota to aid in digestion, as well as potential toxins and irritants. The role of intestinal {{epithelial cells}} is to act as a barrier and provide information of the composition of the luminal content in the intestine to the cells dispersed in the lamina propria, including immune cells. A controlled passage of immunogenic substances through intestinal epithelial cells is possible either via a paracellular pathway or a transcellular pathway. Paracellular permeability allows passage through complex protein structures called tight junctions while the transcellular pathway allows passage through the intestinal epithelial cells by endocytosis. Despite the crucial role of intestinal barrier function in maintaining gut homeostasis, intestinal permeability is poorly described during the neonatal period, either in term or preterm neonates. Research suggests that there is a decrease in intestinal permeability with age, however literature is contradictory and no firm conclusion can be drawn due to the paucity of data. Intestinal barrier function is highly influenced by the external environment, especially lumen nutritional content. Clinical trials and animal models have shown that this is particularly true during the neonatal period where formula-feeding increases intestinal permeability. The mechanisms leading to this impaired barrier function during post-natal development have not been identified. Animal models have indicated that formula composition can be improved by reducing protein content or by adding exogenous substances naturally present in breast milk, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, prebiotics or anti-microbial substances. Finally, long-term consequences of inaccurate development of intestinal barrier function during the neonatal period have been hypothesised to be the cause of increased sensitivity of the intestine and immune cells later in life, leading to inflammation or autoimmunity. The long-term consequences of intestinal barrier dysfunction due to formula vs. breastfeeding on gut function in adulthood have yet to be explored...|$|R
40|$|Male Nezara viridula produce sex pheromones {{from many}} {{independent}} single cells, {{each with a}} duct that opens onto the ventral abdominal surface. Despite the presence of along duct and an associated end complex (in {{the form of a}} cupule and microvillus saccule), the structural organization of the cells that comprise the gland conform to Class 1 epidermal gland cell classification : a single cell surrounds the entire secretory complex. Each cuticular cupule contains a central bed of filaments and opens into a narrow tubular ductule that leads {{from the base of the}} cupule through the epidermis to the cuticle to open externally as a pore. The cuticle of the cupule is continuous with that of the ductule and has the appearance of three layers, although the inner (middle) layer may be a gap formed during construction of the complex. In young adult males, just molted, the ultrastructure of the cells and their inclusions indicate that they are not active. The region of the cell that is distal to the abdominal cuticle is reduced and the proximal region, surrounding the duct, is enlarged when compared with sexually mature (3 - 4 weeks old) adult males. At maturity the pheromone cells are enlarged distally around the cupule, but are reduced to a narrow sleeve proximally, around the ductule. Two characteristic cell profiles are evident, based on the shape of the cupule and the organelle content. Type A shows a broad opening to the cupule, an abundance of mitochondria, and few vesicular bodies. Type B has an elongated, narrow, vase-like opening to the cupule, few mitochondria, and numerous vesicular bodies. Type B cells are smaller and more abundant than Type A. Distribution within the epidermal layer also differs. It is likely that the different types represent cells producing different secretion profiles. However, the secretions retained by the standard fixation protocol within mature cells of both types look similar and appear to collect as crystalline <b>bodies</b> within the <b>lumen.</b> This may represent a common storage mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{extensive}} {{development of}} the ruminant forestomach sets apart their N economy from that of nonruminants {{in a number of}} respects. Extensive pregastric fermentation alters the profile of protein reaching the small intestine, largely through the transformation of nitrogenous compounds into microbial protein. This process is fueled primarily by carbohydrate fermentation and includes extensive recycling of N between the <b>body</b> and gut <b>lumen</b> pools. Nitrogen recycling occurs via blood and gut lumen exchanges of urea and NH 3, as well as endogenous gut and secretory N entry into the gut lumen, and the subsequent digestion and absorption of microbial and endogenous protein. Factors controlling urea transfer to the gut from blood, including the contributions of urea transporters, remain equivocal. Ammonia produced by microbial degradation of urea and dietary and endogenous AA is utilized by microbial fermentation or absorbed and primarily converted to urea. Therefore, microbial growth and carbohydrate fermentation affect the extent of NH 3 absorption and urea N recycling and excretion. The extensive recycling of N to the rumen represents an evolutionary advantage of the ruminant in terms of absorbable protein supply during periods of dietary protein deficiency, or asynchronous carbohydrate and protein supply, but incurs a cost of greater N intakes, especially in terms of excess N excretion. Efforts to improve the efficiency of N utilization in ruminants by synchronizing fermentable energy and N availability have generally met with limited success with regards to production responses. In contrast, imposing asynchrony through oscillating dietary protein concentration, or infrequent supplementation, surprisingly has not negatively affected production responses unless the frequency of supplementation is less than once every 3 d. In some cases, oscillation of dietary protein concentration has improved N retention compared with animals fed an equal amount of dietary protein on a daily basis. This may reflect benefits of Orn cycle adaptations and sustained recycling of urea to the gut. The microbial symbiosis of the ruminant is inherently adaptable to asynchronous N and energy supply. Recycling of urea to the gut buffers the effect of irregular dietary N supply such that intuitive benefits of rumen synchrony in terms of the efficiency of N utilization are typically not observed in practice...|$|R
40|$|African horsesickness virus (AHSV) is a dsRNA {{virus that}} belongs to the Orbivirus genus within the Reoviridae family. Each of the ten viral dsRNA {{segments}} encodes one virus-specific protein. During its life cycle AHSV replicates both in an insect vector and in a mammalian host, but while it has no detrimental effect on insect cells the virus is highly pathogenic to mammalian cells. It is postulated that this relates to different viral release mechanisms. Currently the main candidate for mediating viral release in both insects and mammals is the viral nonstructural protein NS 3. In bluetongue virus (BTV), the prototype virus of the Orbivirus genus, {{it has been shown}} that NS 3 interacts with both the viral outer capsid protein VP 2 and a cellular exocytosis protein. For AHSV, we investigated whether the same mechanism was involved in viral release. This study aimed to identify and map possible protein-protein interaction between AHSV NS 3 and VP 2, and AHSV NS 3 and unknown insect cellular proteins. For investigating the NS 3 -VP 2 interactions a eukaryotic expression system (yeast twohybrid), a column binding assay utilising bacterially expressed NS 3 and recombinant baculovirus expressed VP 2 as well as a membrane flotation assay utilising recombinant baculovirus expressed VP 2 and NS 3 -GFP, were used. A number of problems were encountered and no conclusive results were obtained. For investigating viral-cellular protein interactions the yeast two-hybrid system was also used, utilising NS 3 as bait to screen proteins expressed from a Drosophila cDNA library. Results showed an interaction between the N-terminal region of AHSV NS 3 and ubiquitin, an essential protein for the trafficking and degradation of membrane proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum. It also acts as a sorting signal in both the secretory pathway and in endosomes, where it targets proteins into multivesicular <b>bodies</b> in the <b>lumen</b> of vacuoles/lysosomes. It has been shown that ubiquitin could play a role in the pinching off of budding vesicles. An AHSV infected cell could therefore potentially use ubiquitin in its vesicular budding pathway, therefore giving the opportunity for viruses to use this to release them from the cell. The Hsp 70 was another protein identified that interacts with AHSV NS 3. This protein plays a role in folding reactions, protein translocation across membranes of organelles and protein assembly. It has been reported in other studies done that both ubiquitin and Hsp 70 play roles in regulating the bioavailability of viral proteins, which could explain the different levels of NS 3, high in insect cells and low in mammalian cells, which indirectly control the viral exit pathway used, budding versus lytic release. These results lay the foundation for explaining the potential role of NS 3 in the AHSV life cycle in insect cells. Dissertation (MS) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011. Geneticsunrestricte...|$|R
40|$|Preterm birth (< 37 weeks {{completed}} {{weeks of}} gestation) affects 9 - 12 % of all live births; {{with the majority}} being moderately preterm birth (32 - 36 weeks gestation). It {{is the leading cause}} of neonatal mortality and morbidity and males have been reported to be at greater risk than females. In this thesis, I have examined the effect of moderate preterm birth, using an ovine model, on the structure of the heart and cardiomyocyte growth, and on the structure and composition of the large conduit arteries (thoracic aorta and left carotid artery). Pregnant ewes were induced to deliver vaginally using epostane (50 mg in 2 ml ethanol) at 0. 9 of term (132 ± 1 days of gestation) or at term (147 ± 1 days of gestation). Clinically relevant doses of Betamethasone (11. 4 mg) were also administered 24 hours and 48 hours before birth to ewes delivering preterm. Offspring were euthanised 2 days after birth or at 14. 5 months of age. During the study period, preterm sheep were significantly lighter and smaller compared to term controls, with survival rates 75 % for both preterm male and preterm female lambs after the first 2 weeks of life. At 12 months of age, body composition was not different between preterm and term sheep. By 14 months of age, preterm female sheep had caught up in body weight to terms; however preterm males were still lighter than term males. At this time, no detectable differences in arterial pressure and heart rate were observed between preterm and term sheep. In the immediate period after birth, preterm hearts were lighter and smaller compared to terms; however, relative to body weight, only right ventricular (RV) chamber volume remained smaller and left ventricle (LV) and RV walls were thicker. Total number of cardiomyocytes within the LV plus septum (LV+S) was not significantly different between preterm and term lambs; however relative to body weight, preterm lambs exhibited significantly more cardiomyocytes. Preterm lambs also had a significantly higher proportion of mononucleated cardiomyocytes in the LV+S but significantly lower proportion of binucleated cardiomyocytes compared to term lambs; indicative of an immature heart. In adulthood, preterm sheep had smaller RV and LV wall volumes, but when adjusted to body weight, there were no longer any differences. Interestingly, there was sexual dimorphism in the long-term effects on the LV+S; preterm male sheep exhibited significantly reduced wall volume, wall thickness and cardiomyocyte number compared to term male sheep, whereas no differences were observed between preterm and term females. In the immediate period after birth, there was no evidence of arterial injury in the thoracic aorta or left carotid artery. At this time, preterm lambs had narrower lumen areas in both blood vessels and thinner walls were observed in the left carotid artery. When adjusted for <b>body</b> weight, <b>lumen</b> area and wall thickness actually increased in the aorta of preterm lambs compared to term controls. Collagen deposition within the aortic wall was significantly reduced in preterm male lambs compared to terms. In adulthood, the number of elastin layers and elastin content was significantly reduced, whereas smooth muscle content increased in the left carotid artery of preterm sheep compared to term sheep. Interestingly, there was sexual dimorphism observed in the effects of preterm birth on aortic structure, such that preterm male sheep exhibited significant reductions in lumen size, medial area, intima-media thickness and layers of elastin compared to term male sheep, however no differences were observed in females. In my studies, moderate preterm birth after antenatal corticosteroid exposure has resulted in significant alterations in cardiovascular structure, predominantly in males. Even though, these differences are likely attributed to the smaller body size of the preterm male sheep, the reduced complement of cardiomyocytes in the LV+S and thinner walls with fewer layers of elastin in the aorta are likely to render the adult preterm male cardiovascular system particularly vulnerable to secondary postnatal insults and increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular consequences in later life. In conclusion, this thesis provides valuable insight into the effects of moderate preterm birth on the cardiovascular system in the immediate period after birth and in early adulthood. Overall, this study is clinically important given the large proportion of individuals born moderately preterm. The findings highlight the cardiovascular vulnerability of those born moderately preterm, particularly in males, and these adverse effects are expected to be greater with increasing severity of prematurity...|$|R
