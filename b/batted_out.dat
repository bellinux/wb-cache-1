5|$|The 1948 Australia {{team that}} toured England {{has become known}} as The Invincibles, because they did not lose a single game. Following their {{performances}} during the Australian season, Barnes and Morris were favoured as Australia's first-choice opening pair, while Brown <b>batted</b> <b>out</b> of position in the middle order in the first two Tests.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{reassembled}} at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Australia dropped Bill Brown, their reserve opener, who had <b>batted</b> <b>out</b> {{of position}} in the middle order and scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three Test innings. Brown {{was replaced by the}} all rounder Sam Loxton; the move had an unexpected impact on Johnson's playing role during the Test.|$|E
5|$|Brown thus gained {{selection}} for the First Test, batting {{out of position}} in the middle order while Sid Barnes and Morris opened, whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India. This was the exact situation that had unfolded in the Worcestershire and MCC matches when Australia fielded their first-choice team; Harvey did not play and Brown <b>batted</b> <b>out</b> of position in the middle order. There was a chance of Harvey receiving a last-minute call-up when Barnes was ill with food poisoning in the week {{leading up to the}} Test, but the opener recovered.|$|E

50|$|Meat Loaf's <b>Bat</b> <b>Out</b> of Hell trilogy of albums (consisting of <b>Bat</b> <b>Out</b> of Hell, <b>Bat</b> <b>Out</b> of Hell II: Back into Hell, and <b>Bat</b> <b>Out</b> of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose) {{has sold}} more than 50 million copies worldwide. Almost 40 years after its release, it still sells an {{estimated}} 200,000 copies annually, and stayed on the charts for over nine years, {{making it one of the}} best selling albums in history. He is also known for his powerful wide-ranging operatic voice and theatrical live performances.|$|R
5|$|England batted {{again and}} Tallon {{dismissed}} George Emmett from Lindwall with a diving one-handed catch. Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, {{who took it}} {{in his right hand}} with a dive, leaving England at 1/1. England then declared at 3/174; Tallon conceded nine byes and with more than a day was lost to rain, Tallon was not required as Australia <b>batted</b> <b>out</b> the last session for a draw.|$|E
5|$|On 26 January 2008 {{during the}} 4th and final Test of the 2007–08 series against India, Gilchrist {{announced}} that he would retire from international cricket {{at the end of the}} season. A back injury kept Ricky Ponting off the field for sections of the Indian's second innings, resulting in Gilchrist captaining the team for the part of final two days of his Test cricket career. India <b>batted</b> <b>out</b> the match for a draw, so Gilchrist's 14 in the first innings was his final Test innings; he took his 379th and final catch when Virender Sehwag was caught behind. Gilchrist had scored only 150 runs at 21.42 in his final Test series.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{traditionally}} fielded its strongest possible team in {{the tour}} opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Barnes opened with Morris, while reserve opener Brown <b>batted</b> <b>out</b> of position in the middle order. The hosts won the toss and batted first, and Barnes took the last two catches as Australia dismissed them for 233. He delivered nine overs with his leg spin and was the most economical Australian bowler, conceding ten runs without taking a wicket. When Australia batted, Barnes made 44 from 104 balls in 99 minutes before being the first batsman to fall at 1/79.N- Australia reached 462 and dismissed the hosts for 212 to complete a victory by an innings and 17 runs. During the second innings, Barnes took his first wicket for the tour, having Laddy Outschoorn caught behind by Don Tallon to spark a collapse that saw the home side lose their last five wickets for 47 runs. Barnes ended with 1/25 and took two catches in the second innings; all four of his catches for the match were from spinners.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bat</b> <b>Out</b> of Hell is a {{rock musical}} written by Jim Steinman. Steinman wrote {{all of the}} songs, {{many of which were}} {{previously}} recorded by Meat Loaf on the albums <b>Bat</b> <b>Out</b> of Hell and <b>Bat</b> <b>Out</b> of Hell II: Back into Hell. The musical follows Strat, the forever young leader of The Lost who has fallen for Raven, daughter of Falco, the tyrannical ruler of Obsidian.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bat</b> <b>Out</b> of Hell II: Picture Show is a 1993 {{music video}} by Meat Loaf. Besides the three music videos {{directed}} by Michael Bay for the singles from <b>Bat</b> <b>Out</b> of Hell II: Back into Hell, the video contains three live performances {{and interviews with}} Meat Loaf and songwriter/producer Jim Steinman. Until {{the release of the}} 2006 Collectors Edition of <b>Bat</b> <b>Out</b> of Hell II, this was the only official release of the video clips.|$|R
50|$|In February 2017, Steinman's <b>Bat</b> <b>Out</b> of Hell The Musical, {{based on}} the hit 1977 album <b>Bat</b> <b>Out</b> of Hell, opened for previews at the Manchester Opera House in Manchester, England, and will officially open at the London Coliseum in June.|$|R
5|$|The next {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. Bradman installed Barnes and Morris as his preferred opening pair, while Brown <b>batted</b> <b>out</b> of position at No. 6. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team lined up in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same positions. It was a chance for players from both sides to gain a psychological advantage, but Brown failed to capitalise. He came to the crease with the score at 4/280 to join Keith Miller and scored 26 in a stand of 63 before being dismissed as Australia amassed 552 and won by an innings. This was followed by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, against Lancashire, a draw for which Brown was rested.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Second World War cost Brown his peak years, which he spent in the Royal Australian Air Force. Cricket resumed in 1945–46 and Brown, in Bradman's absence, captained an Australian eleven in a match that was retrospectively awarded Test status. Brown missed {{the entirety of the}} following season because of injury. Upon his return, he was unable to repeat his previous success and was ousted from the opening positions by Arthur Morris and Sid Barnes. Selected for the Invincibles tour, he performed reasonably well in the tour matches but, with Morris and Barnes entrenched as openers, he <b>batted</b> <b>out</b> of position in the middle order during the first two Tests. He struggled and was dropped from the Test team, never to return. Upon returning to Australia, Brown continued playing for Queensland {{until the end of the}} 1949–50 season.|$|E
5|$|Bosanquet {{played in}} the first Test against Australia, making his Test debut for England. Australia batted first and {{recovered}} from a poor start to score 285 runs; Bosanquet took the wickets of Warwick Armstrong and Syd Gregory with googlies to finish with two for 52 in 13 overs. He scored a single run when he <b>batted,</b> <b>out</b> of an English total of 577. In the second innings he bowled 23 overs and took one for 100. The English bowlers came under heavy punishment from the Australian batsmen; Victor Trumper scored an unbeaten 185 and the team reached 485. Bosanquet had Monty Noble stumped, and Warner later wrote {{that he was in}} good form with the ball, beating Trumper with a googly and troubling others. England needed to score 194 to win and Bosanquet came to the wicket with 13 needed to win; he scored one run before the winning hit was made. A hand injury forced Bosanquet to miss the second Test. However, with England 2–0 up in the series, he returned for the third Test. On a very good pitch for batting, Bosanquet took three for 95 in an Australian innings of 388, and none of the batsmen were comfortable batting against his googly. When England replied, Bosanquet was out for 10 runs, hitting a poor shot as his team were bowled out for 245. In Australia's second innings, Bosanquet bowled badly at first, delivering full tosses and long hops {{at the end of the}} third day's play. Next morning, his bowling improved as he established a good length, delivering a spell of seven overs in which he took four wickets for 23 runs, again causing confusion with his googly. He finished the innings with figures of four for 73. However, he failed again with the bat, scoring 10 runs in his second innings as England fell to a heavy defeat.|$|E
50|$|This album's title {{also became}} the title {{for two more}} Meat Loaf albums. Steinman {{produced}} the album <b>Bat</b> <b>Out</b> of Hell II: Back into Hell (1993). Desmond Child produced the album <b>Bat</b> <b>Out</b> of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose (2006).|$|R
50|$|Both <b>Bat</b> <b>Out</b> of Hell and <b>Bat</b> <b>Out</b> of Hell II: Back into Hell are {{prominently}} featured {{with five}} tracks {{from the first}} and four from the second. The album did not feature any songs from his 1986 album Blind Before I Stop.|$|R

25|$|On August 2, 1923, Bush noticed {{early in}} a game that Hank Severeid and Wally Gerber of the St. Louis Browns had {{switched}} spots in the batting order and <b>batted</b> <b>out</b> of turn. In the second, fifth and seventh innings both players made outs, and Bush said nothing. In the ninth inning, Gerber hit a single with two out and a runner on first base. Bush appealed to the umpire that Gerber had <b>batted</b> <b>out</b> of order. Gerber was declared out to end the game.|$|E
25|$|Injuries limited his {{appearances}} in 1946 as well. In the Old Trafford Test, {{he went in}} last and <b>batted</b> <b>out</b> 13 minutes with Ranga Sohoni to save the match.|$|E

25|$|The Warriors {{could have}} gone second in the Pura Cup table if they had managed to force a win {{on the final day}} against the Redbacks, having earned a three-run first innings lead when Steve Magoffin had Dan Cullen caught behind for six midway through day three. Effectively 88 for three overnight, the Warriors lost nightwatchman Beau Casson and Adam Voges in the first session, but Marcus North and Dave Bandy <b>batted</b> <b>out</b> four hours in a 211-run fifth-wicket partnership. The Warriors <b>batted</b> <b>out</b> the day to draw the game, and were thus third, with a chance to qualify with a win in the final round at the Bushrangers.|$|E
25|$|India lost Virender Sehwag {{early in}} their reply, but then Wasim Jaffer and Rahul Dravid <b>batted</b> <b>out</b> the day without further loss to take the hosts to 136/1 {{by the end of}} day 2. The match was very nicely balanced.|$|E
25|$|Australia won the toss and {{opted to}} bat first. After losing David Warner for 38, the duo of Chris Rogers and Steve Smith <b>batted</b> <b>out</b> {{the rest of}} day one and both scored {{hundreds}} in the process.

25|$|Glamorgan Dragons {{were out}} of luck at Bristol, as their top order {{collapsed}} to the bowling of Carl Greenidge. Only a last-wicket partnership between Robert Croft and Dean Cosker ensured that Glamorgan <b>batted</b> <b>out</b> 20 overs, as they were 70 for 8 at one point but finished on 128 for 9. However, it was never enough. Croft took two wickets with his off-spin, but Craig Spearman's 39 built the platform as Gloucestershire Steelbacks eased to victory with 17 balls to spare.|$|E
25|$|There was no Currie Cup the {{following}} season, but Taylor still played three first class games, {{though he was}} relegated down the order. Against the touring New Zealanders Taylor batted at number seven; in a rain-affected game at Ellis Park, Transvaal hit 145 for eight in 29 overs, with Taylor slapping Tony MacGibbon, Bob Blair and John Richard Reid for 64 runs, 40 {{more than any other}} Transvaal batsman. Transvaal declared overnight, trailing by 71 runs, but New Zealand <b>batted</b> <b>out</b> the day for a draw.|$|E
25|$|England {{were thus}} left to chase 75 for the Ashes, but Emma Liddell didn't {{want to be}} beaten, and her pace trapped Laura Newton and Jenny Gunn lbw in the second over as England lost their first two wickets for one run. However, Liddell couldn't get any further breakthroughs, and even though England lost Connor and Edwards to Fitzpatrick - both lbw - Arran Brindle <b>batted</b> <b>out</b> an hour for 24 not out to see England to the target about three hours before the {{scheduled}} close.|$|E
