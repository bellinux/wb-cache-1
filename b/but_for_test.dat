We characterize these games in terms of marginal contribution to the great coalition and we provide a typology of different overdetermined causation cases.

One of {{the more}} {{intriguing}} questions in tort law {{is the case of}} joint and several tortfeasors and the dilution-of-liability puzzle. When harm materializes and there are multiple potential tortfeasors, the law tends {{to limit the number of}} joint tortfeasors, focusing the final burden on a small number of actors. This limitation is achieved by several legal mechanisms, such as a no duty rule, a narrow interpretation of negligence, a restrictive implementation of the causal link (be it the <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>test,</b> the proximate cause test or the rule of intervening cause test), and a doctrine of remoteness of damage. Thus, in the typical accident example, if A, B, and C inflicted risk upon D, often times the tort system will filter out A and B and leave only C to carry the final burden.

Extraction was performed by ultrasonic treatment, followed by isolation by alkaline extraction with isohexane. Derivatization with N-Methyl-bisheptafluorobutyric amide enabled gas chromatography-mass pectrometry analysis of the perfluorobutyryl derivatives in selected ion monitoring mode. The methylphenidate concentrations lay between 0. 073 and 1. 1 ng/mg hair.

40|$|The {{so-called}} "Cristallini Method" for {{sampling of}} UF 6 by adsorption and hydrolysis in alumina pellets inside a fluorothene P- 10 tube {{has been developed}} by the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC) several years ago [1]. This method has several advantages compared to the currently used sampling method, for which UF 6 is distilled into a stainless steel tube for transportation, with hydrolysis and isotopic analysis being performed after shipping to the analytical laboratory. Using the Cristallini sampling method the transport is cheaper and relatively safer concerning radiological protection aspects. In order to be reliable for both scientific and nuclear safeguards applications, the Cristallini sampling method {{has been subjected to}} a rigorous validation program. This includes a variety of sampling materials and measurement methods for the isotopic analyses as well as numerous participating laboratories around the world. The involved organizations include laboratories in Argentina, Brazil (collaborating within ABACC), Germany, Belgium (sites of Joint Research Centre, JRC, in Karlsruhe and Geel, respectively), Austria (Safeguards Analytical Services Laboratory of the IAEA) and within the United States, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the NBL-Program office and ASTM. This technical report describes in particular the application of the "Double Spike" method by thermal ionization mass spectrometry (DS/TIMS) for the validation program of the Cristallini method, performed by staff from the unit JRC-G. 2 in Geel/Belgium (formerly IRMM) in collaboration with staff from SGAS/IAEA. The results are in good mutual agreement, but they reveal slight differences for the 235 U/ 238 U isotope ratios for samples taken by the Cristallini method compared to samples processed in the traditional manner by distillation and subsequent direct hydrolysis. For test samples prepared by ABACC using the IRMM- 020 (0. 2 % 235 U) and IRMM- 022 (0. 72 % 235 U) certified UF 6 reference materials, significant differences of about 0. 01 %- 0. 02 % were observed, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>test</b> samples prepared from IRMM- 023 (3. 3 % 235 U) the differences are insignificant. The reason for the observed differences is not yet known, they can be due to fractionation, contamination or memory effects occurred during the sampling or subsequent chemical processing. The results from JRC-G. 2 and SGAS/IAEA using the double spike method play a special role within the validation program due to the high precision of this method. The results are proposed to be included for the intended standardization of the Cristallini sampling method through ASTM, in particular for defining an additional uncertainty component to account for the sampling process and the subsequent sample preparation, which would have to be attributed in the future to all isotopic measurements on samples taken by the Cristallini sampling method.

40|$|In {{computational}} aeroelasticity, unsteady aerodynamics is computationally expensive {{compared to}} the structural calculation. This problem becomes more severe for prediction of flutter or Limit-Cycle oscillation (LCO), which requires multiple runs of simulations at various flow conditions. The former can be captured by linear computational-aerodynamic-fluid (CFD) solver, while the prediction of the latter requires nonlinear CFD solver. Reduced-order modelling (ROM) techniques for unsteady aerodynamics have been investigated extensively. Among these ROMs, Auto-Regression with eXogeneous variables (ARX) {{has been applied to}} predict the flutter behaviour successfully for relatively complicated test cases. Motivated by the nice performance of ARX, whether other linear system identification methods, such as Auto-Regression Moving Average with eXogeneous inputs (ARMAX), Output-Error (OE) and Box-Jenkins (BJ), are effective as linear ROMs is investigated. When it comes to the nonlinear ROM, the linear information is expected to use. A polynomial-based state-space model, extended from linear system identification, is defined to combine the linear part with nonlinear functions of the state and input. A direct requirement for the linear method is the representation in state-space form. The nonlinear functions compose of polynomials of degree equal or greater than $ 2 $. The coefficients of this nonlinear model are obtained by solving an optimisation problem with a Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. Furthermore, we assume that the linear method is capable of capturing the flutter and keep the linear matrices constant during the nonlinear optimisation to reduce computational cost. As for the test case for LCO, an analytical Van-der-pol (VDP) oscillator is selected. The nonlinear ROM is built to replace the nonlinear term in VDP. Coefficients of the nonlinear ROM are obtained by solving an optimisation problem and the validation is carried out by reproducing the VDP oscillation. Another important factor for a fairly accurate ROM is the training signal. Different training signals are examined to reproduce the VDP oscillation. After checking the theoretical representation and the numerical solution algorithm, ARX and ARMAX are selected as linear ROMs for two reasons: the construction of state-space representation is explicit; ARMAX model is a variation from ARX by adding averaged error terms without changing the stability of the system. The comparison is carried out in two test cases. In the analytical test case, ARX and ARMAX can reproduce the training signal very well after an order selection and capture the flutter boundary. For the second test case, using CFD data, ARX and ARMAX match training signals well, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>test</b> signals, ARMAX shows a lower fitness caused by overestimation of error contribution. For the nonlinear training, the optimiser can follow the nonlinear behaviour of the reference output, which demonstrates significant error reduction {{compared to the}} linear model. The validation of the ROM is examined for different training signals: chirps, random phase multi-sine, sequential sinusoids and multi-chirps. Chirps and sequential sinusoids fail to reproduce VDP. For most cases, random phase multi-sine is unable to follow VDP oscillation. Although the bounded oscillation is predicted for certain cases, repetitive tests are not consistent. For the multi-chirps, the optimiser is changed to accustom the cost function. With a couple of tests, this signal can deterministically reproduce the bounded oscillation, but the accuracy is not high. Another assumption that typical frequencies at flutter and LCO are not far apart is considered. Sequential sinusoids with narrow frequency band and wide amplitude range are applied to construct the nonlinear ROM in both random and deterministic cases. The frequencies and amplitudes are randomly chosen with the frequencies predetermined in the random case, while frequencies and amplitudes in the deterministic case are scattered uniformly. The LCO behaviour is predicted quite well in terms of amplitude and frequency in the bounded phase but not in transitional stage for both the cases. Repetitive tests are required for the random case. This study applied ARX and ARMAX as the linear ROM for flutter prediction and built the polynomial-based nonlinear ROM for predicting LCO. The observation that narrowing frequency range and widening amplitude range increase the chance of capturing LCO can be used for nonlinear training signal design.
