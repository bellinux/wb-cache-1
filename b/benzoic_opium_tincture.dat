2500|$|In the United States, <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> {{contains}} 10 mg per mL of anhydrous morphine. [...] By contrast, <b>opium</b> <b>tincture's</b> weaker cousin, paregoric, also confusingly {{known as}} [...] "camphorated tincture of opium", is 1/25th {{the strength of}} <b>opium</b> <b>tincture,</b> containing only 0.4mg of morphine per mL. [...] A 25-fold morphine overdose may occur if <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> is used where paregoric is indicated. <b>Opium</b> <b>tincture</b> is almost always dosed in drops, or fractions of a mL, or less commonly, in minims, while paregoric is dosed in teaspoons or tablespoons. [...] Thus, an order for <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> containing directions in teaspoons is almost certainly in error. [...] To avoid this potentially fatal outcome, the term [...] "camphorated tincture of opium" [...] is avoided in place of paregoric since the former can easily be mistaken for <b>opium</b> <b>tincture.</b>|$|R
2500|$|<b>Tincture</b> of <b>Opium</b> {{is known}} as one of many [...] "unapproved drugs" [...] {{regulated}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); the marketing and distribution of <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> prevails today only because <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> was sold prior to the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act of 1938. [...] Its [...] "grandfathered" [...] status protects <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> from being required to undergo strict FDA drug reviews and subsequent approval processes. However, the FDA closely monitors the labeling of <b>opium</b> <b>tincture.</b> Bottles of <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> are required by the FDA to bear a bright red [...] "POISON" [...] label given the potency of the drug and the potential for overdose (see discussion about confusion with Paregoric below). Despite <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> being an [...] "unapproved drug" [...] as discussed above, a search of FDA's website does not reveal any efforts at this time to ban <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> or restrict its use; in fact, the FDA has a [...] devoted to patient and practitioner education about <b>opium</b> <b>tincture.</b> However, in a warning letter to a manufacturer of <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> in late 2009, the FDA noted that [...] "In regard to your unapproved drugs, we found that your firm is manufacturing and distributing the prescription drug <b>Opium</b> <b>Tincture</b> USP (Deodorized—10 mg/mL). Based on our information, there are no FDA-approved applications on file for this drug product." [...] This warning may indicate a shift in FDA policy toward banning <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> or at least requiring the product to be brought within the FDA's regulatory framework.|$|R
5000|$|Most modern {{formulations}} of <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> {{do not contain}} the alkaloid narcotine (also known as noscapine), which has antitussive properties. Even modest doses of narcotine can induce profound nausea and vomiting. Since <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> is usually prescribed for its antidiarrheal and analgesic properties (rather than as an antitussive), <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> without narcotine is generally preferred. This [...] "de-narcotized" [...] or [...] "deodorized" [...] <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> is formulated using a petroleum distillate to remove the narcotine.|$|R
50|$|<b>Opium</b> <b>tincture</b> {{is useful}} as an {{analgesic}} and antidiarrheal. Opium enhances the tone {{in the long}} segments of the longitudinal muscle and inhibits propulsive contraction of circular and longitudinal muscles. The pharmacological effects of <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> are due principally to its morphine content. The quantity of the papaverine and codeine alkaloids in <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> {{is too small to}} have any demonstrable central nervous system effect.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, the FDA {{issued a}} [...] "Patient Safety" [...] news {{bulletin}} stating that [...] "To help resolve the confusion <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> and paregoric, FDA {{will be working}} with the manufacturers of these two drugs to clarify the labeling on the containers and in the package inserts." [...] Indeed, in 2005, labels for <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> began to include the concentration of morphine (10 mg/mL) in large text beneath the words [...] "Opium Tincture". The FDA has also alerted pharmacists and other medical practitioners {{about the dangers of}} confusing these drugs, and has recommended that <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> not be stocked as a standard item (i.e., that it should not be [...] "on the shelf"), that <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> be dispensed in oral syringes, and that pharmacy software alert the dispenser if unusually large doses of <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> appear to be indicated.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Opium</b> <b>tincture</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} potent oral {{formulations}} of morphine available by prescription. [...] Accidental or deliberate overdose is common with <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> given the highly concentrated nature of the solution. Overdose and death may occur with a single oral dose of between 100 and 150mg of morphine in a healthy adult who is not habituated to opiates. [...] This represents the equivalent of between two to three teaspoons of <b>opium</b> <b>tincture.</b> [...] Suicide by laudanum was not uncommon in the mid-19th century. [...] Prudent medical judgment necessitates toward dispensing very small quantities of <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> in small dropper bottles or in pre-filled syringes to reduce the risk of intentional or accidental overdose.|$|R
2500|$|Despite the FDA's efforts {{over the}} past few years, the {{confusion}} persists, sometimes with deadly results. [...] The Institute for Safe Medication Practices recommends that <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> not be stocked at all in a pharmacy's inventory, and that [...] "It may be time to relegate <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> and paregoric to the museum of outmoded opioid therapy." [...] Despite the risk of confusion, <b>opium</b> <b>tincture,</b> like many end-stage medications, is indispensable for intractable diarrhea for terminally ill patients, such as those suffering from AIDS and cancer.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Opium</b> <b>tincture</b> is used {{to treat}} {{neonatal}} abstinence syndrome (NAS) when diluted 1:25 (one part <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> to 25 parts water). The recommended dose is 0.2 mL of the diluted solution under the tongue every three hours, which may be increased by 0.05 mL every three hours until no objective signs of withdrawal are observed. In no event, however, should the dose exceed 0.7 mL every three hours. [...] The <b>opium</b> <b>tincture</b> is gradually tapered over a 3–5 week period, {{at which point the}} newborn should be completely free of withdrawal symptoms.|$|R
