50|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} (TBCs) are used {{extensively on the}} surface of superalloy in both commercial and military gas turbine engines to increase component life and engine performance. A coating of about 1-200 µm can reduce the temperature at the superalloy surface by up to 200K. TBCs are really a system of coatings consisting of a <b>bond</b> <b>coat,</b> a thermally grown oxide (TGO), and a thermally insulating ceramic top coat. In most applications, the <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> is either a MCrAlY (where M=Ni or NiCo) or a Pt modified aluminide coating. A dense <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> is required to provide protection of the superalloy substrate from oxidation and hot corrosion attack and to form an adherent, slow growing TGO on its surface. The TGO is formed by oxidation of the aluminum that is contained in the <b>bond</b> <b>coat.</b> The current (first generation) thermal insulation layer is composed of 7wt % yttria stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) with a typical thickness of 100-300 µm. Yttria stabilized zirconia is used due to its low thermal conductivity (2.6W/mK for fully dense material), relatively high coefficient of thermal expansion, and good high temperature stability. The electron beam directed vapor deposition (EB-DVD) process used to apply the TBC to turbine airfoils produces a columnar microstructure with several levels of porosity. The porosity between the columns is critical to providing strain tolerance (via a very low in-plane modulus), as it would otherwise spall on thermal cycling due to thermal expansion mismatch with the superalloy substrate. The porosity within the columns reduces the thermal conductivity of the coating.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{examines}} the failure mechanisms of TBC-coated systems during cyclic temperature exposure without additional mechanical load in the temperature range between 900 °C and 1050 °C. If failure appeared until an testing duration of 5000 h in the temperature range between 900 °C and 950 °C, it {{was driven by}} {{the formation of a}} brittle chromium-carbide layer in the interdiffusion zone between the substrate and the MCrAlY <b>bond</b> <b>coating.</b> It can be distinguished between two cases. At a low activity of chrome in the MCrAlY, the carbon from the substrate can diffuse into the <b>bond</b> <b>coating</b> and leads there to local precipitations of chromium-carbide, that doesn't exert, however, any effect on the bonding of the MCrAlY. If the activity of chrome in the <b>bond</b> <b>coating</b> is however high, the formation of a closed chromium-carbide layer caused cracks and subsequent spallation during temperature changes. It could be shown that specifically the elements rhenium and aluminum contribute to a significant increase of the chrome activity. If spallation of the TBC occurred in the temperature range between 1000 °C to 1050 °C, it was correlated with the oxidation of the <b>bond</b> <b>coating.</b> A flawless a-Al 2 O 3 oxide layer doesn't necessarily need to contribute to increased lifetimes. Since cracks have their origin generally at defects, the crack propagation takes place along the border between the <b>bond</b> <b>coating</b> and the oxide layer for components with a pure oxide layer and a smooth MCrAlY-surface. Considering a rough <b>bond</b> <b>coating</b> surface, a crack will be initiated along the border between oxide and TBC. In a defect containing oxide layer, however, cracks that develop within the oxide can be stopped at flaws. Consequently, an optimal <b>bond</b> <b>coating</b> seems to be one that develops an existing optimal surface roughness and trains a defect containing oxide layer with a slow growth rate...|$|R

50|$|The <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> adheres {{the thermal}} barrier coating to the {{superalloy}} substrate. Additionally, the <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> provides oxidation protection and functions as a diffusion barrier against the motion of substrate atoms towards the environment.There are five major types of bond coats, the aluminides, the platinum-aluminides, MCrAlY, cobalt-cermets, and nickel-chromium.For the aluminide bond coatings, the final composition {{and structure of the}} coating depends on the composition of the substrate. Aluminides also lack ductility below 750 °C, and exhibit a limited by thermomechanical fatigue strength. The Pt-aluminides are very similar to the aluminide bond coats except for a layer of Pt (5—10 μm) deposited on the blade. The Pt is believed to aid in oxide adhesion and contributes to hot corrosion. The cost of Pt plating is justified by the increased blade life span. The MCrAlY is the latest generation of <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> and does not strongly interact with the substrate. Normally applied by plasma spraying, MCrAlY coatings are secondary aluminum oxide formers. This means that the coatings form an outer layer of chromium oxide (chromia), and a secondary aluminum oxide (alumina) layer underneath. These oxide formations occur at high temperatures in the range of those that superalloys usually encounter. The chromia provides oxidation and hot-corrosion resistance. The alumina controls oxidation mechanisms by limiting oxide growth by self-passivating. The yttrium enhances the oxide adherence to the substrate, and limits the growth of grain boundaries (which can lead to flaking of the coating). Investigation indicates that addition of rhenium and tantalum increases oxidation resistance. Cobalt-cermet based coatings consisting of materials such as tungsten carbide/cobalt can be used due to excellent resistance to abrasion, corrosion, erosion, and heat. These cermet coatings perform well in situations where temperature and oxidation damage are significant concerns, such as boilers. One of the unique advantages of cobalt cermet coatings is a minimal loss of coating mass over time, due to the strength of carbides within the mixture. Overall, cermet coatings are useful in situations where mechanical demands are equal to chemical demands for superalloys. Nickel-chromium coatings are used most frequently in boilers fed by fossil fuels, electric furnaces, and waste incineration furnaces, where the danger of oxidizing agents and corrosive compounds in the vapor must be dealt with. The specific method of spray-coating depends on the composition of the coatings. Nickel-chromium coatings that also contain iron or aluminum perform much better (in terms of corrosion resistance) when they are sprayed and laser glazed, while pure nickel-chromium coatings perform better when thermally sprayed exclusively.|$|E
50|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} typically consist of four layers: the metal substrate, metallic <b>bond</b> <b>coat,</b> thermally-grown oxide (TGO), and ceramic topcoat. The ceramic topcoat is typically composed of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) which is desirable for having very low conductivity while remaining stable at nominal operating temperatures typically seen in applications. This ceramic layer creates the largest thermal gradient of the TBC {{and keeps the}} lower layers at a lower temperature than the surface. However, above 1200 °C, YSZ suffers from unfavorable phase transformations, going from t'-tetragonal to tetragonal to cubic to monoclinic. Such phase transformations lead to crack formation within the top coating. Recent advancements in finding an alternative for YSZ ceramic topcoat identified many novel ceramics (rare earth zirconates) having superior performance at temperatures above 1200 °C, however with inferior fracture toughness {{compared to that of}} YSZ. In addition, such zirconates may have a high concentration of oxygen ion vacancies, which may facilitate oxygen transport and exacerbate the formation of the TGO. With a large enough TGO, spalling of the coating may occur, which is a catastrophic mode of failure for TBCs. The use of such coatings would require addition coatings that are more oxidation resistant, such as alumina or mullite.|$|E

Thermal cycling and isothermal experiments are carried out on a platinum-aluminide <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> and on a NiCoCrAlY <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> deposited on a Ni-based superalloy in air and in vacuum.

The <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> surfaces in cyclic experiments rumple to a similar characteristic wavelength of about 60 - 100 ??m and an amplitude varying from 2 ??m to 5 ??m.

40|$|Thermal barrier coating (TBC) {{applications}} {{continue to}} increase {{as the need for}} greater engine efficiency in aircraft and land-based gas turbines increases. However, durability and reliability issues limit the benefits that can be derived from TBC's. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms that cause TBC failure is a key to increasing, as well as predicting, TBC durability. Oxidation of the <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> has been repeatedly identified as one of the major factors affecting the durability of the ceramic top coat during service. However, the mechanisms by which oxidation facilitates TBC failure are poorly understood and require further characterization. In addition, researchers have suspected that other <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> and top coat factors might influence TBC thermal fatigue life, both separately and through interactions with the mechanism of oxidation. These other factors include the <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> coefficient of thermal expansion, the <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> roughness, and the creep behavior of both the ceramic and <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> layers. Although it is difficult to design an experiment to examine these factors unambiguously, it is possible to design a computer modeling "experiment" to examine the action and interaction of these factors, as well as to determine failure drivers for TBC's. Previous computer models have examined some of these factors separately to determine their effect on coating residual stresses, but none have examined all the factors concurrently. The purpose of this research, which was performed at DCT, Inc., in contract with the NASA Lewis Research Center, was to develop an inclusive finite element model to characterize the effects of oxidation on the residual stresses within the TBC system during thermal cycling as well as to examine the interaction of oxidation with the other factors affecting TBC life. The plasma sprayed, two-layer thermal barrier coating that was modeled incorporated a superalloy substrate, a NiCrAlY <b>bond</b> <b>coat,</b> and a ZrO 2 - 8 wt % Y 2 O 3 ceramic top coat. We examined the effect on stress during burner rig thermal cycling of the following independent variables: creep in the <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> and top coat, oxidation, <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> coefficient of thermal expansion, number of thermal cycles, and interfacial roughness. All these factors were suspected of influencing TBC failure. The model showed that all the material properties studied had a significant effect on the coating's residual stresses if the interface of the <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> was rough. <b>Bond</b> <b>coat</b> expansion, <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> oxidation, and <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> creep had the highest effect on coating stresses, and these were highly interactive.

Oxidation of the <b>bond</b> <b>coat,</b> on the other hand, tended to dominate stress generation during later cycles by greatly increasing delamination stresses over <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> valleys.

Thermal cycling oxidation tests were performed to evaluate the influence of ZrO 2 addition and substrate composition. The addition of ZrO 2 particles to PtAl coatings on Mar M 246 and Inconel 718 appeared to accelerate the growth of thermally grown oxide and reduced the rumpling of thermally grown oxide. However, when depositing PtAl coatings with ZrO 2 nanoparticles on Mar-M- 247, there was no changes, as mentioned above, in thermally grown oxide.

Instead of oxygen diffusion barrier, Ir exhibited a diffusion barrier to Al possibly by forming a high temperature solid solution with Al, which has a higher melting point than general β-NiAl phase. As a result, it restrained the inward diffusion of Al and slowed down the outward diffusion of Al, thus improving the oxidation resistance.

An area fraction of 3 ̆b 2 -NiAl phases within the <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> was calculated by image analysis, and a reasonable approach to estimate time for complete depletion of the Al-rich 3 ̆b 2 -NiAl phase within the <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> was suggested.

40|$|NiCoCrAlTaY <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> was {{deposited}} by cold spraying {{to assemble}} thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). The microstructure of the cold-sprayed <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> was examined using scanning electron microscopy. TBCs consisting of cold-sprayed <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> and plasma-sprayed YSZ were pretreated at different con-ditions to form different thermally grown oxides (TGOs) before thermal cycling test. The {{influence of the}} TGO composition on the thermal cyclic lifetime was quantitatively examined through the measurement of the coverage ratio of the mixed oxides on the <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> surface. The {{results showed that the}} <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> exhibited a dense oxidation-free microstructure, and TGOs in different morphologies and constituents were present after thermal cyclic test. The formation of TGOs was significantly influenced by pre-treatment conditions. Two kinds of TGO were detected on the surface of <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> after the spallation of YSZ coatings. One is the a-Al 2 O 3 -based TGO and the other is the mixed oxide. It was found that the thermal cyclic lifetime is inversely proportional to the coverage ratio of the mixed oxides formed at the bond coat/YSZ interface. The high coverage ratio of the mixed oxide on the interface leads to the early spalling of YSZ coating.

40|$|Plasma {{pretreatment}} {{on the top}} {{and bond}} coats was performed and its influence on the thermal durability of thermal barrier coating (TBC) system was investigated through cyclic thermal exposure. Two types of <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> were prepared by different methods, namely, air plasma spray (APS) and high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF), and two kinds of feedstock powder were employed for preparing the top coat in APS process. The better thermal durability was achieved in the vertically cracked TBC with the surface modified <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> or with the <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> prepared by APS process. The hardness and fracture toughness values of TBCs increased because of densification of the top coat during cyclic thermal exposure, and the <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> prepared by HVOF process showed higher values than that by APS process. The TBCs with the surface modified <b>bond</b> <b>coat</b> were more efficient in improving adhesive strength than those without plasma pretreatment on the <b>bond</b> <b>coat.</b> The relationship between microstructure evolution and thermomechanical characteristics of TBCs with plasma pretreatment was discussed in cyclic thermal exposure...|$|E

40|$|A cyclic furnace {{study was}} {{conducted}} between 990 - 280 C and 1095 - 280 C to evaluate the effects of yttrium, chromium, and aluminum concentrations in nickel base alloy bond coatings and also {{the effect of the}} <b>bond</b> <b>coating</b> thickness on the performance of yttria-stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coatings. The presence and the concentration of yttrium is very critical. Without yttrium, rapid oxidation of Ni-Al, Ni-Cr, and Ni-Cr-Al bond coatings causes zirconia thermal barrier coatings to fail very rapidly. Concentrations of chrominum and aluminum in Ni-Cr-Al-Y <b>bond</b> <b>coating</b> have a very significant effect on the thermal barrier coating life. This effect, however, is not as great as that due to yttrium. Furthermore, the thickness and the thickness uniformity also have a very significant effect on the life of the thermal barrier system...|$|R
