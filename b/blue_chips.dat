25|$|Knight has {{appeared}} or {{been featured in}} numerous films and television productions. In 1994 a feature film titled <b>Blue</b> <b>Chips</b> featured a character named Pete Bell, a volatile but honest college basketball coach under pressure to win who decides to blatantly violate NCAA rules to field a competitive team after a sub-par season. It starred Nick Nolte as Bell and NBA star Shaquille O'Neal as Neon Bodeaux, a once-in-a-lifetime player Bell woos to his school with gifts and other perks. The coach's temper and wardrobe were modeled after Knight's, though at no time had Knight been known to illegally recruit. Knight himself appears in the movie and coaches against Nolte in the film's climactic game.|$|E

500|$|The game {{features}} {{items and}} traps which will either help or impede the player's progress. Collecting <b>blue</b> <b>chips</b> {{scattered around the}} levels will increase the player's score; time chips will extend the player's time and slow [...] "Awakers" [...] (if collected on foot). Flying through gold rings will replenish the player's boost meter, spiked rings will harm the player if flown through, and green rings will never disappear (unlike ordinary gold rings). The gameplay also {{involves the use of}} [...] "persona masks", which will transform Nights into a different entity, thus granting new abilities to the player. There are three personas: transforming into a dolphin allows the player to swim underwater, a rocket speeds up Nights' flight, and a dragon will increase resistance to wind. Bosses are encountered twice in each level—an easier version early in a level, and a more difficult one at the end.|$|E

500|$|Each {{level is}} split up into four [...] "Mares" [...] set in Nightopia and a boss fight {{which takes place}} in Nightmare. In each level, players {{initially}} control Claris or Elliot, who immediately have their Ideyas (spherical objects that contain emotions) of hope, wisdom, intelligence and purity stolen from them by Wizeman's minions, leaving behind only their Ideya of courage. The goal of each Mare is to recover one of the stolen Ideya by collecting 20 <b>blue</b> <b>chips</b> and delivering them to the cage holding the Ideyas, which will overload and release the orb it holds. If the player walks around the landscape for too long, they will be pursued by a sentient alarm clock which will awaken the character and end the level if it comes {{into contact with the}} player. The majority of the gameplay centres on flying sequences, which are triggered by walking into the Ideya Palace near the start of each level so that the character merges with the imprisoned Nights. Once the flying sequence is initiated, the time limit will begin.|$|E
