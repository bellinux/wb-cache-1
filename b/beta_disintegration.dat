40|$|ABSTRACT. Counting radioisotopes in {{microplates}} requires special {{technology to}} count with good efficiency and negligible crosstalk between wells. In the TopCountTM Microplate Scintillation Counter, we use time-resolved counting technology to achieve high counting efficiencies and low backgrounds {{with a single}} photomultiplier tube (PMT), which collects light {{from the top of}} the microplate well. We developed liquid and solid scintillants that produce slowly decaying pulse trains, and the electronics to discriminate true <b>beta</b> <b>disintegration</b> events from noise based on the pulse characteristics. Crosstalk is prevented by the basic design of the instrument and the use of opaque, reflective microplates. Crosstalk from 'H or 14 C is not measurable above background, whereas crosstalk from penetrating radiation, such as "I or 32 P, is measurable, but only a fraction of a percent. With the virtual absence of crosstalk, sample spectra are not corrupted by small crosstalk pulses, and the sample spectra (tSIS) can be used for reliable quench correction. With 24 -well microplates, it is possible to introduce an external standard for quench correction using the external standard spectrum (tSIE), and accurate dual-label counting can be performed. Fast, single-photon detection circuitry permits luminescence measurements using two detectors with a dynamic range of up to 106 and with crosstalk of less than 0. 03 %...|$|E
