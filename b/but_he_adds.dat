The problem is, since the EZ peripheral countries do not have their own currencies, {{they are forced to}} adjust their economies by decreasing their wages instead of devaluation.|$|E

25|$|Many authorities, {{including}} the Rema, note the custom {{that the father}} of a firstborn should fast on his child's behalf until the child reaches halakhic adulthood. The Rema rules that if the father is a firstborn himself, the mother should fast on behalf of the child. The Mateh Moshe and Maharil dispute this and rule in such a scenario that the mother need not fast. The Magen Avraham rules that it is appropriate to follow the lenient opinion if fasting causes the mother excessive discomfort or if she is pregnant or nursing, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> that a mother who begins following the former opinion must maintain that custom and fast in subsequent years.|$|E

Four years later, in the 1906–07 season, he went back to New Zealand with a MCC side composed of amateur players that played 11 first-class matches in a three-month period. These were his only experiences of international cricket, though Foot writes, in his history of Somerset cricket: [...] "It's well known that he was invited to go to Australia with the Warner-Douglas team" [...] of 1911–12. <b>But,</b> <b>he</b> <b>adds,</b> [...] "he thought hard about it, tried in vain to revise his business schedules and said no to likely fame." ...|$|E

[...] Theron Martin says [...] "for the series as a whole to be worth watching, though, the storytelling and character development need to improve". Melissa Harper adds it is a [...] "slick, well animated show" [...] but [...] "disjointed story {{makes it difficult to}} know or care what is going on".

2500|$|Nyrop {{writes that}} the most common example is the [...] "intense feeling which knits parents to their offspring", <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> that kisses of affection are not only common between parents and children, but also between {{other members of the}} same family, which can include those outside the {{immediate}} family circle, [...] "everywhere where deep affection unites people." [...] The tradition is written of in the Bible, as when Orpah kissed her mother-in-law and when Moses went to meet his father-in-law, he [...] "did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent" [...] (Exodus 18:7); and when Jacob had wrestled with the Lord he met Esau, ran towards him, fell on his neck and kissed him. The family kiss was traditional with the Romans and kisses of affection are often mentioned by the early Greeks, as when Odysseus, on reaching his home, meets his faithful shepherds.|$|E
2500|$|The term is {{also used}} in {{reference}} to attacks on non-Jewish ethnic minorities, and accordingly some scholars do not include antisemitism as the defining characteristic of pogroms. Reviewing its uses in scholarly literature, historian Werner Bergmann proposes that pogroms should be [...] "defined as a unilateral, nongovernmental form of collective violence initiated by the majority population against a largely defenseless ethnic group, and he states that pogroms occur when the majority expects the state {{to provide them with}} no assistance in overcoming a (perceived) threat from the minority," [...] <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> that in western usage, the word's [...] "anti-Semitic overtones" [...] have been retained. [...] Historian David Engel supports this, writing that [...] "there can be no logically or empirically compelling grounds for declaring that some particular episode does or does not merit the label ," [...] but he states {{that the majority of the}} incidents [...] "habitually" [...] described as pogroms took place in societies significantly divided by ethnicity and/or religion where the violence was committed by the higher-ranking group against a stereotyped lower-ranking group against whom they expressed some complaint, and with the belief that the law of the land would not be used to stop them.|$|E

2500|$|The {{event that}} is often {{considered}} {{to have been the}} first conflict between Rome and Constantinople was triggered by the elevation of the see of Constantinople to a position of honour, second only to Rome on the grounds that, as capital of the eastern Roman empire, it was now the [...] "New Rome". This was promulgated in the First Council of Constantinople (381) canon 3 which decreed: [...] "The Bishop of Constantinople, however, shall have the prerogative of honour after the Bishop of Rome because Constantinople is New Rome." [...] It has been asserted by many that the Council of Rome, a synod held by Pope Damasus I in the following year, 382, protested against this raising of the bishop of the new imperial capital, just fifty years old, to a status higher than that of the bishops of Alexandria and Antioch, and stated that the primacy of the Roman see was established by no gathering of bishops but by Christ himself. Thomas Shahan says that, according to Photius too, Pope Damasus approved the council of Constantinople, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> that, if any part of the council were approved by this pope, it could have been only its revision of the Nicene Creed, as was the case also when Gregory the Great recognized it as one of the four general councils, but only in its dogmatic utterances. In Roman Catholic doctrine, no council, regardless of who summoned it or who presided over it, is ecumenical unless it is confirmed or at least recognized as such by the pope.|$|E
2500|$|Cleanth Brooks {{used the}} Ode: Intimation of Immortality {{as one of}} his key works to analyse in his 1947 work The Well Wrought Urn. His {{analysis}} broke down the ode as a poem disconnected from its biographical implications and focused on the paradoxes and ironies contained within the language. In introducing his analysis, he claimed that it [...] "may be surmised from what has already been remarked, the 'Ode' for all its fine passages, is not entirely successful as a poem. Yet, we shall be able to make our best defense of it in proportion as we recognize and value its use of ambiguous symbol and paradoxical statement. Indeed, it might be maintained that, failing to do this, we shall miss much of its power as poetry and even some of its accuracy of statement." [...] After breaking down the use of paradox and irony in language, he analyses the statements about the childhood perception of glory in Stanza VI and argued, [...] "This stanza, though not one of the celebrated stanzas of the poem, {{is one of the most}} finely ironical. Its structural significance too is of first importance, and has perhaps in the past been given too little weight." [...] After analysing more of the poem, Brooks points out that the lines in Stanza IX contains lines that [...] "are great poetry. They are great poetry because ... the children are not terrified... The children exemplify the attitude toward eternity which the other philosopher, the mature philosopher, wins to with difficulty, if he wins to it at all." [...] In his conclusion about the poem, he argues, [...] "The greatness of the 'Ode' lies in the fact that Wordsworth is about the poet's business here, and is not trying to inculcate anything. Instead, he is trying to dramatize the changing interrelations which determine the major imagery." [...] Following Brooks in 1949, C. M. Bowra stated, [...] "There is no need to dispute the honour in which by common consent it [...] is held" [...] <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> [...] "There are passages in the 'Immortal Ode' which have less than his usual command of rhythm and ability to make a line stand by itself... But these are unimportant. The whole has a capacious sweep, and the form suits the majestic subject... There are moments when we suspect Wordsworth of trying to say more than he means. Similarly, George Mallarby also revealed some flaws in the poem in his 1950 analysis: [...] "In spite of the doubtful philosophical truth of the doctrine of pre-existence borrowed from Platon, in spite of the curiously placed emphasis and an exuberance of feeling somewhat artificially introduced, in spite of the frustrating and unsatisfying conclusion, this poem will remain, so long as the English language remains, one of its chief and unquestionable glories. It lends itself, more than most English odes, to recitation in the grand manner." ...|$|E
