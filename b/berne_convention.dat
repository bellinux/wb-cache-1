5|$|The <b>Berne</b> <b>Convention</b> for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works has {{protected}} the copyrights on literary, scientific, and artistic works since 1886. Article 9 of the Convention states that: Authors of {{literary and artistic works}} protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorising {{the reproduction of}} these works, in any manner or form.... Any sound or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction {{for the purposes of this}} Convention. This means a composer has performing rights and control over how derivative works should be used, and the rights are retained at least 50 years after death, or even longer. Even if a song is a traditional arrangement in the public domain, performing rights can still be violated. Where they exist, performers rights may have a shorter duration than full copyright; for example, the Rome Convention sets a minimum term of twenty years after the performance. This created a market for bootleg CDs in the late 1980s, containing 1960s recordings.|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} four essays on the development and effects in developing countries of international protection of intellectual property rights (IPRs). The first essay critically reviews the literature on rationales for and against IPR institutions. Several theoretical and empirical considerations provide increasing grounds for doubting the welfare gains for developing countries of increasing IPR protection. The second essay examines the patterns and driving forces of international IPR protection since {{the enactment of the}} Paris and <b>Berne</b> <b>Conventions.</b> Over 2, 800 country-level decisions were considered within a 120 year period and 68 Treaties. The analysis shows that IPR protection has been historically positively related to the level of economic development of countries, confirming literature reports. Such evolutionary tend is disrupted with current IPR harmonisation. The third essay analyses industrial property protection provisions of 17 post WTO-TRIPs US bilateral trade agreements with smaller and mostly “South” countries undertaken in the 2000 s. The analysis reveals significant heterogeneity on extent of protection reached by different bilateral trade partners. The fourth essay examines the determinants of IPR protection reached bilaterally between the US and small south countries during the 2000 s. A political economy model of a North-South bilateral joint negotiation of market access and IPRs rules is developed, in which governments’ decisions are driven by their preferences, and the possibility of facing costs inflicted by stakeholders. The model is tested using data developed in the third essay. After controlling for countries’ IPR preferences, the data supports the model’s predictions; South countries that enable organised and non-organised stakeholders to inflict costs on governments when policies deviate from their preferences have been able to resist North (US) demands regarding IPR protection more successfully.

25|$|The same {{law also}} {{modified}} the provisions on the copyright of foreign works. It added an article 5(4) {{to the law}} that defined that a foreign work was eligible to copyright in Russia if its copyright had not expired in the source country and it had not fallen into the public domain in Russia through the expiry of its copyright term. Previously, foreign works published before May 27, 1973, when the USSR had joined the Universal Copyright Convention (UCC), had not been copyrighted {{at all in the}} Soviet Union or in Russia, even after Russia had joined the <b>Berne</b> <b>Convention</b> in 1995. When Russia had signed the <b>Berne</b> <b>Convention,</b> it had made a reservation regarding article 18 of the <b>Berne</b> <b>Convention</b> by stating that it would not consider the <b>Berne</b> <b>Convention</b> applicable to any works in the public domain in Russia. Foreign pre-1973 works thus remained uncopyrighted in Russia, although they should have become subject to copyright according to article 18(2) of the <b>Berne</b> <b>Convention</b> because that article only exempted works that once were copyrighted, but on which that copyright already had expired, which didn't apply to pre-1973 foreign works in Russia. Russia faced severe criticism for this, especially from Western countries. The new article 5(4) of the Russian copyright law was supposed to resolve the situation by restoring copyright on such foreign works and making Russia's copyright law fully compliant with the <b>Berne</b> <b>Convention.</b> Nevertheless, the common practice in Russia did not change; pre-1973 foreign works were still commonly considered to be uncopyrighted in Russia due to this reservation.|$|E

40|$|Professor Reichman uncovers {{a paradox}} {{at the heart}} of the debate about {{bringing}} international intellectual property relations within a GATT Code of Conduct. On the one hand, the industrialized countries that subscribe to free-market principles at home want to impose a highly regulated market for intellectual goods on the rest of the world, one in which authors and inventors may 2 ̆ 2 reap where they have sown. 2 ̆ 2 On the other hand, the developing countries that restrict free competition at home envision a totally unregulated world market for intellectual goods, one in which 2 ̆ 2 competition is the lifeblood of commerce. 2 ̆ 2 To unravel this paradox, he identifies a set of postulates for negotiators on both sides. Included in this list is the lack of an international norm against misappropriation; a long-term need to assimilate intangible alien property to the international law of state responsibility; the duty to respect soveriegn rights of both rich and poor states to control their own economic destinies; and the emergence of preferential treatment for developing countries as a principle of international economic law. Armed with these postulates, Professor Reichman derives a set of analytical propositions to guide a TRIPs negotiation conducted in the spirit of cooperation and good faith. A crucial move in this analysis is to distinguish between defensive proposals to institute transitional legal barriers to imports of nonqualifying intellectual goods and offensive proposals to establish universal standards of protection that could limit the development strategies even of states that do not export intellectual goods to major markets. As regards proposals for a defensive alliance bolstered by common border control measures and by the dispute settlement machinery of the GATT, Professor Reichman offers a new interpretation of Article XX(d) that minimizes conflict with the basic GATT disciplines. However, Contracting Parties that participate in a defensive alliance must strictly respect their obligations to provide national treatment under the Paris, Berne, and Geneva (U. C. C) Conventions, and they may find the transaction costs of implementing the scheme too high in the end. As regards offensive proposals that pit universal standards of protection against national developmental strategies, Professor Reichman finds that basic GATT rules cannot be overcome unless preferential measures favoring the developing counties are combined with trade concessions off-setting the costs of economic dislocation. Given such an approach, Professor Reichman suggests that Contracting Parties that already adhere to intellectual property conventions can be persuaded to provid adequate, not maximum, levels of protection for the traditional subject matters of those Conventions, and they should renounce systematic misappropriation of applied scientific know-how. Contracting Parties that do not adhere to one or more intellectual property conventions pose a harder case, but Professor Reichman argues that these states cannot expect indefintely to exploit the most valuable alien property of all without paying compensation in one form or another. Professor Reichman fears, however that maximalist illusions will cause the Uruguay Round to produce fewer positive results than could have been attained in a spirit of moderation and compromise. He warns thet continued insistence on universalist these unacceptable to the developing countries risks provoking these countries to form a 2 ̆ 2 Union 2 ̆ 2 of their own in order to curtail rights that the industrialized countries currently enjoy under existing intellectual property conventions. He points out that the real losers in such a confrontation would be those authors, inventors and trademark proprietors whose livelihood depends on the day-to-day operations of the international system that the Paris and <b>Berne</b> <b>Conventions</b> set in place over a century ago...|$|R
40|$|The Nature Management Act – Act of 19 June 2009 no. 100 – is a {{milestone}} in Norwegian environmental legislation. It constitutes a follow-up to Article 110 b of the Constitution which establishes a right for everyone to a natural environment whose productivity and diversity is maintained whilst leaving the implementation of this right to further regulation. The Act replaces the 1970 Nature Conservation Act and is a thorough modernisation {{of the law in}} the light of present-day environmental principles and international conventions. It is guided by the 1992 Biodiversity Convention and serves as the legal basis for national implementation of other international instruments in the field of nature conservation, such as CITES, the World Heritage Convention and the Ramsar and <b>Berne</b> <b>Conventions.</b> The Act came into force on 1 July 2009, except for its provisions relating to the introduction and release of invasive alien species. The Act covers natural diversity in all its aspects – living organisms, landscape, and geology. All species of Norwegian fauna and flora are covered, including invertebrates and, in principle, algae and single-celled organisms. The Act can be said to provide rules on three different levels. First, it lays down the legal basis for preserving outstanding natural areas and rare or threatened species, in particular by protected areas and priority species. Secondly, it provides for the management of natural diversity elsewhere in built-up or rural areas, particularly by selected habitat types, principles for wildlife management, and rules on invasive alien species. Thirdly, with a view to encouraging sustainable use of natural resources, it lays down management objectives, a general duty of care with respect to natural diversity and a number of environmental principles that shall guide decisionmaking by public authorities in pursuance of the Act itself or of any other statutory legislation, as well as the allocation of grants from the public purse or the exercise of public ownership. Harvesting of wildlife and salmon and fresh-water fish is permitted only when expressly authorised. For plants, harvesting is, as a main rule, allowed unless it will threaten the survival of the local population of species. The authorities may be obliged to consider a species for priority status if it is registered on the Norwegian Red List and functional ecological areas may be designated for priority species. Subject to certain exceptions, the deliberate import or release of alien species will require a special permit. More stringent rules are introduced for the five different categories of protected areas including their management. Legal protection is improved against encroachments whilst a proposal for a protected area is under consideration. National parks may be established even on private ground and marine protected areas may be created within the limit of territorial waters. Landowners will receive compensation from the state for economic loss due to impediments to ongoing land use but not for restrictions on new future use. The instrument of selected habitat types has been inspired by similar European networks. After the Government’s selection of habitat types local authorities will be able to consider the various localities under the Planning and Building Act 2008. New statutory rules deal with the access to genetic resources and benefitsharing from the extraction and exploitation of genetic material and allows for a permit requirement to be introduced by regulations under the Act. Lastly, the Act authorises various enforcement measures including reinstatement orders, direct enforcement and coercive fines, as well as sanctions against violations in the form of damages or criminal sanctions. The Act is divided into ten chapters and consists of a total of 78 sections. The provisions regarding the objectives of the Act, management objectives, environmental principles, and access to genetic material apply to the Norwegian continental shelf and economic zone {{as well as to the}} land territory and territorial waters. The other provisions do not apply beyond the limit of territorial waters, but the Government intends to examine further the feasibility of an extended geographical scope. ...|$|R

Rzepa, Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London We have developed the Chemical Semantic Web so that computers can understand primary publications and act upon them. An autonomous machine could read and understand an issue from J. Med. Chem., extract the information, run high-throughput computations and systematize the results leading to new scientific insights. For robots the most exciting and most tractable part of scientific publications are formalized presentations of data (e. g. analytical proof of synthesis) and supplemental data (e. g. crystallography and spectra). We argue that these are "facts" under the <b>Berne</b> Copyright <b>convention</b> and therefore re-usable without hindrance. For many decades humans have manually abstracted articles and produced compilations and we argue that robots {{can do the same}} to great communal benefit. However it appears that some publishers now see a journal as a database and may regard chemically-aware robots as unacceptable under their license terms. The public Semantic Web currently depends on complete absence of barriers to the re-use of information. Robots cannot currently negotiate license agreements, logon to sites, or make micropayments. We see Open Access, especially to data, as an exciting opportunity to transform chemical informatics and provide a global knowledge base. We shall present arguments that funders, researchers, editors and readers should promote a model of publication for Open Data.

40|$|In {{the global}} {{capitalist}} economy, people, goods, services, capital, culture, and ideas flow through borders with ease, and countries {{interact with each}} other in a complex, interdependent economic relationship. As information and knowledge become increasingly commodified, high-technology goods and services have become a staple of both domestic and crossborder trade. In many developed and middle-income developing countries, information- and entertainment-based industries now constitute some of the most highly important and fastest growing sectors in the national economy. The protection of intellectual property rights has therefore moved from a meager domestic or bilateral issue to the forefront of the international trade debate. The chapter begins by tracing the international enclosure movement from the creation of <b>Berne</b> and Paris <b>Conventions</b> to the establishment of the TRIPs Agreement and the recent bilateral and regional trade agreements. It explains how the one-size-fits-all standards required by the latter agreements have drastically reduced the policy space available to less developed countries.

It discusses, in particular, the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (―Doha Declaration‖), the Decision on the Implementation of Paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (―August 30 Decision‖), and the proposed article 31 bis of the TRIPs Agreement.
