40|$|AbstractStructural {{steel is}} {{commonly}} used as construction material. In designing structural steel, practitioners typically use the steel section properties table to obtain the necessary data needed to calculate the nominal strength of the selected section. The commercially available section properties tables in Indonesia typically list the weight, section area, inertia, radius of gyration, and section modulus of the commercially available steel sections. In many cases, {{it is not uncommon}} for <b>built-up</b> <b>sections</b> to be used as structural members. The section properties of these <b>built-up</b> <b>sections</b> are not readily available in the aforementioned section properties table. A series of tables have been developed to enlist the section properties of the <b>built-up</b> <b>sections</b> that are commonly used in Indonesia. Moreover, these tables also provide the nominal strength of the <b>built-up</b> <b>sections</b> with respect to several loads, i. e. tension, compression, bending, and shear. These nominal capacities will enable the practitioners to design <b>built-up</b> structural steel <b>sections</b> more easily and efficiently...|$|R
40|$|Cold-formed steel {{members have}} been used {{extensively}} in low and mid-rise residential building construction. The usage of cold-formed steels as primary structural members has been increased due to its high load to weight ratio. Cold-formed steel <b>built-up</b> <b>sections</b> are commonly used as compression elements to carry larger loads and over longer spans when a single individual section is insufficient. However, not much {{research has been done}} on <b>built-up</b> <b>sections.</b> This paper aims to investigate the compressive capacity of pin-ended cold-formed steel <b>built-up</b> I <b>sections</b> using the finite element method (FEM). In the study, cold-formed steel built up I section consists of two identical C-channels sections oriented back to back forming an I-shaped cross section and connected to each other at certain spacing along their length. A non-linear finite element model is developed and verified against theoretical and experimental results. The theoretical numerical analysis is based on the Effective Width Method and the Direct Strength Method. As for the experimental testing, the compression test is carried out on 11 specimens. It was shown that the finite element methods results correlate well with the experimental results. In addition, the analytical results by the Effective Width Method and Direct Strength Method are generally conservative for cold-formed steel <b>built-up</b> I <b>sections...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{advantages}} of using cold-formed steel are high strength-to-weight ratio, flexibility in fabricating different cross-section shapes, easy for construction and so on. Cold-formed steel sheets are usually manufactured into open sectional profiles by cold-rolling and brake-pressing methods. Doubly symmetric built-up sections, with {{the advantage of}} having larger torsional rigidity compared to traditional singly symmetric open sections, have great potential to extend the application of cold-formed steel to structural members with larger scale. The doubly symmetric built-up open and closed sections {{can be made by}} connecting two channel sections using self-tapping screws, which are also convenient for industrialized production. In this study, the structural performance of cold-formed steel <b>built-up</b> <b>section</b> beams with intermediate stiffeners and <b>built-up</b> <b>section</b> beams with web perforations was examined through experimental and numerical investigations. The impact of different screw arrangements on the moment capacities of <b>built-up</b> <b>section</b> beams was also studied. A total of 113 beam tests that include simply supported beam tests of 16 pairs of channel sections with stiffened webs, 19 built-up sections with intermediate stiffeners, 43 built-up sections with web perforations, as well as 35 built-up sections with different screw arrangements was conducted. The material properties of the test specimens were also obtained by tensile coupon tests. The main objective of the experimental investigation is to obtain the section moment capacities and understand the structural behaviour of the built-up sections under bending. Finite element (FE) models of the beam specimens were also developed and numerical analysis that includes material nonlinearity, geometric nonlinearity and contact nonlinearity (for <b>built-up</b> <b>section</b> beams only) was performed and the results were verified against the test results. The validated FE models were employed for extensive parametric studies of 382 numerical simulations that include 101 channel sections with stiffened webs, 113 built-up sections with intermediate stiffeners, 80 built-up sections with web perforations, as well as 88 built-up sections having different screw arrangements. A wide range of section slenderness was considered in the built-up sections and different failure modes of beams were investigated. Therefore, a comprehensive study on the influence of stiffener features, different sizes of web holes, and various screw arrangements on the structural performance of cold-formed steel <b>built-up</b> <b>section</b> beams was carried out. The results obtained from the experimental and numerical studies were employed for evaluating the design rules of cold-formed steel <b>built-up</b> <b>section</b> beams. It should be mentioned that the existing direct strength method (DSM) for cold-formed steel members does not cover the design of <b>built-up</b> <b>section</b> beams. Hence, suitable design rules based on DSM have been proposed for cold-formed steel <b>built-up</b> <b>section</b> beams with intermediate stiffeners and <b>built-up</b> <b>section</b> beams with web perforations under bending. The design equations for considering the screw spacings of built-up closed section beams have also proposed.

A total of 18 test specimens were fabricated from hot-rolled {{stainless steel plates}} by means of shielded metal arc welding (SMAW). Two grades of stainless steel were considered, namely the austenitic grade EN 1. 4301 and the duplex grade EN 1. 4462. Using the sectioning method, the test specimens were divided into strips. The residual stresses were then computed by multiplying the strains relieved during sectioning by the measured Young??s moduli determined from tensile and compressive coupon tests. Residual stress distributions were obtained for 10 I-sections, four square hollow sections (SHS) and four rectangular hollow sections (RHS). Peak tensile residual stresses reached around 80 % and 60 % of the material 0. 2 % proof stress for grades EN 1. 4301 and EN 1. 4462, respectively.

The sub-assemblage frame consists of a <b>built-up</b> hybrid beam <b>section</b> connected to two cruciform column sections using typical end-plate connection. The connections used in this study are the flush and extended end-plate that proposed by the Steel Construction Institute for wind-moment connection but incorporating several modifications. The sub-assemblage frame was tested under monotonic load until failure, and the <b>built-up</b> hybrid beam <b>section</b> is unrestrained against out-of-plane deformation, to control the failure criterion of the beam to lateral-torsional buckling. The structural behavior of the sub-assemblage frame was closely observed and the experimental results were compared to the theoretical model proposed by the authors. The rotational stiffness and moment capacity of the end-plate connection tested in the sub-assemblage frame were predicted using the results obtained from the isolated connection tests. The experiment results showed the failure of the sub-assemblage frame is dominated by lateral-torsional buckling at mid-span of the beam, due to the absence of lateral restraint. Comparison between theoretical and experimental model showed reasonable agreement. The design approach of BS 5950 - 1 : 2000 for beams subjected to bucking moment showed large reserves of strength, which the actual effective length ratio for beams connected using flush end-plate and extended end-plate connection are 0. 70 and 0. 78 respectively.

AISI cold-formed steel framing design guide (2002) has recommended that the moment of resistance and inertia of the <b>built-up</b> <b>section</b> are the simple addition of the component parts, based on deflection compatibility of the two sections. However, this design approximation has not been justified by any experimental or numerical study. Very little information was found in literature about this topic. The objective of this study is the investigation of the flexural behaviour of built-up box girders assembled from cold-formed stud and track sections when subjected to eccentric loading. Finite element analysis is conducted for this purpose, being much more economical than expensive experimental testing. Detailed parametric studies are carried out to identify the factors affecting the flexural capacity of built-up cold-formed steel sections. The parametric results are used to develop a design equation for calculating the flexural capacity of built-up cold-formed steel sections...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} industry uses cold-formed steel (CFS) sheets {{in the form}} of galvanised thin-walled profiles and corrugated sheets. In the past decade, CFS profiles have been competing with their hot-rolled counterparts as primary structural members of industrial halls, office buildings and residential housing of up to 3 - 4 storeys. The spans and column heights achieved with CFS profiles are ever larger. Due to the large slenderness of these members, adequate strength and stability are necessary, as well as reliability in design. Thin-walled members go through buckling during all stages of their working life. Local buckling appears at loads sometimes much lower than the design load. Distortional buckling seriously reduces the member resistance. It interacts with warping and lateral-torsional buckling, being significant for these asymmetric open sections. To restrict these effects, builders employ double sections - usually two standard cold-formed shapes bolted together to form a <b>built-up</b> <b>section.</b> These sections have the advantages of symmetry, higher stability and strength. The design of built-up members involves many uncertainties - although the European standard includes guidelines on the prediction of local, distortional and global buckling, the partial integrity and interaction between the parts of the composed members is still not studied. To study the actual behaviour, built-up members are tested in bending. An optical device for 3 D motion analysis measures the displacement of points of interest on the specimen. Two interacting cameras use parallax to obtain the position of an arbitrary number of reflective markers glued to the specimen. The device tracks the movement of the markers in a 3 D coordinate system without any contact with the specimen. Standard displacement transducers measure vertical displacements to validate the results. The paper gives an appraisal of the applicability of the method, a summary of the difficulties faced and the outcome of the test campaign. status: publishe...|$|E
50|$|Cold-formed steel (CFS) is {{the common}} term for {{products}} made by rolling or pressing steel into semi-finished or finished goods at relatively low temperatures (cold working). Cold-formed steel goods are created by the working of steel billet, bar, or sheet using stamping, rolling (including roll forming), or presses to deform it into a usable product. Cold-worked steel products, such as cold-rolled steel (CRS) bar stock and sheet, are commonly used {{in all areas of}} manufacturing of durable goods, such as appliances or automobiles, but the phrase cold-formed steel is most prevalently used to describe construction materials. The use of cold-formed steel construction materials has become more and more popular since its initial introduction of codified standards in 1946. In the construction industry both structural and non-structural elements are created from thin gauges of sheet steel. These building materials encompass columns, beams, joists, studs, floor decking, <b>built-up</b> <b>sections</b> and other components. Cold-formed steel construction materials differ from other steel construction materials known as hot-rolled steel (see structural steel). The manufacturing of cold-formed steel products occurs at room temperature using rolling or pressing. The strength of elements used for design is usually governed by buckling. The construction practices are more similar to timber framing using screws to assemble stud frames.|$|R
50|$|Whilst most runways and taxi-tracks {{from the}} {{military}} airfield remain, only one runway is primarily used, east-west runway 09-27, which was extended eastwards by the RAF in 1956, to avoid take-offs and landings over <b>built-up</b> areas. A <b>section</b> of the old main runway is currently used for light aircraft.|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{for optimum}} minimum-weight design of <b>built-up</b> wide-flange <b>sections</b> for flexural steel members is presented. The formulation comprises a general solution subject to compact-section and strength constraints. The design {{is based on}} the allowable stress procedure of the American Institute of Steel Construction (ASD-AISC) specifications. The optimum solution is of closed-form so that the section proportioning is direct and simple. The solution is governed by activeness of moment alone or moment and shear together. The process is illustrated {{with the help of an}} example problem which is implemented on a spreadsheet...|$|R
