25|$|McNabb {{requested}} and {{was granted}} {{his release from}} the team on December 1, 2011, with a reported interest in joining the Houston Texans, Kansas City Chiefs or his hometown Chicago Bears, all three of whom had lost their starting quarterbacks for the season to injury but were still making playoff pushes. While the Texans and Chiefs had signed Jake Delhomme and Kyle Orton, respectively, prior to McNabb becoming a free agent, the Bears had not signed anyone and expressed interest in adding McNabb. It was ultimately {{decided that it was}} too late to add a free agent quarterback for the playoff hunt, as it would <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> grasp their offense in the short period of time. The Bears subsequently signed Josh McCown.|$|E

500|$|Thomas {{stated that}} he was {{interested}} in writing a feature film based on the series, in the interest of providing closure to the story lines and character arcs. In September 2008, Michael Ausiello, writing for Entertainment Weekly, reported that Thomas had met with Bell to discuss the plot, which would likely involve Veronica solving crime in college rather than as an FBI agent. Thomas felt that the [...] "FBI scenario was more of a 'What if...?'", aimed at getting a fourth season, and that he [...] "would want to bring back our key players, and it would <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> believe that the FBI stationed Veronica in Neptune." [...] Ausiello later reported that Enrico Colantoni would be involved in the project. Colantoni said that he was fully aware of the talks taking place, adding, [...] "cult shows have translated well into the film arena. Nothing's official, but they're talking about it." [...] In addition to the feature-film possibility, Thomas had a meeting with DC Comics to talk about a Veronica Mars comic book series.|$|E

500|$|California Chrome {{shipped to}} New York on May 20 in a {{semi-trailer}} horse van together with Ride On Curlin. They had a police escort through New York City from the Throgs Neck Bridge to Belmont Park. The [...] press reported that Art Sherman believed the misspelled saddle cloths at the Derby and Preakness {{were a good}} luck charm, and that he specifically asked Belmont Park for another misspelled cloth along with a properly spelled version. The first week California Chrome spent at the Belmont track was generally uneventful, other than galloping past an opossum that wandered onto the track the morning of May 23. The horse {{paid little attention to}} it, but the press pounced on the story; the animal was labeled [...] "Dumb-Ass Possum", and someone created a Twitter account for the creature. Delgado commented, [...] "I can tell you he loves this track, and I don't see him (having) any problem getting a mile and a half." [...] On May 31, Espinoza arrived to give the colt a short workout known as a [...] "breeze". Horse and jockey were greeted by a large contingent of fans and press at about 6:30a.m., and ran a [...] "sharp" [...] half-mile (...) officially clocked at 47.69 seconds.

500|$|On March 26, NFL.com analyst Lance Zierlein {{wrote that}} the Bears' five biggest needs {{entering}} the draft were at outside linebacker, nose tackle, offensive line, safety, and wide receiver. The general consensus regarding the Bears' seventh-overall pick was to select an edge rusher like Vic Beasley (Clemson), Dante Fowler (Florida), Shane Ray (Missouri) and Randy Gregory (Nebraska), though WBBM-TV's Greg Gabriel believed the Bears should trade down from the pick, with players like Arik Armstead (Oregon), Danny Shelton (Washington), Eddie Goldman (Florida State), Jordan Phillips (Oklahoma) and Malcom Brown (Texas) being fits for the Bears' new 3–4 defense if the Bears were to trade down to a spot between 10th and 20th. Another suggested position to draft with the first-rounder was wide receiver, particularly Alabama's Amari Cooper, who, despite not being considered [...] "a true need, a talent like his would <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> pass up here." [...] A defensive position considered for the pick was nose tackle; Sports Illustrated writer Andy Staples believed a 3–4 defense should focus on NT, and as a result, the Bears should draft Shelton, followed by a linebacker in later rounds, such as Eric Kendricks (UCLA), Benardrick McKinney (Mississippi State), Stephone Anthony (Clemson) and Paul Dawson (TCU) in the second round, and afterwards, draft a running back like Buck Allen (USC) or Mike Davis (South Carolina).|$|E

The “Keokuk Gang” {{consisted}} of “Old Man” Ernie Derr, Don White, Ramo Stott and Hutcherson himself. Dick Hutcherson said of Derr: 'Got to beat the old man. The old man will <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> beat {{if you have to}} haul him out in a wheelchair.' He started racing in 1956 and moved up to the International Motor Contest Association (IMCA) circuit in 1959. Hutch was a quick learner and very competitive and took the IMCA championship in 1963 and 1964. He was the Late Model champion at Huron, South Dakota’s Dakota State Fair Speedway in 1960 and 1964. He has 81 IMCA wins to his credit. During this time he also raced in the Midwest Association for Race Cars circuit.|$|E
2500|$|Writing for The Atlantic, Mike Mariani {{wrote that}} [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> {{look at the}} roster of {{television}} shows any given season without finding several that owe a creative debt to Twin Peaks," [...] stating that [...] "Lynch’s manipulation of the uncanny, his surreal non-sequiturs, his black humor, and his trademark ominous tracking shots can be felt {{in a variety of}} contemporary hit shows. In 2010, the television series Psych paid tribute to the series by reuniting some of the cast in the fifth-season episode, [...] "Dual Spires". The episode's plot is an homage to the Twin Peaks pilot, where the characters of Psych investigate the death of a young girl in a small town called [...] "Dual Spires". The episode also contains several references to the original show. Twin Peaks actors that guest star in the episode are Sherilyn Fenn, Sheryl Lee, Dana Ashbrook, Robyn Lively, Lenny Von Dohlen, Catherine E. Coulson and Ray Wise. Prior to the airing of the episode, a special event at the Paley Center for Media was held where the actors from both shows discussed the episode.|$|E
2500|$|Said Steve Kroft on the May 8, 2011, {{edition of}} 60 Minutes, [...] "For {{more than a}} decade, bin Laden managed to elude the U.S. {{military}} and intelligence establishments, and he taunted three U.S. presidents. That finally ended last Sunday, {{and the last thing}} bin Laden saw was a Navy SEAL in the third floor bedroom of his compound in Pakistan." [...] According to The Economist, [...] "The silence of the usual critics of 'illegal', 'extrajudicial', targeted killing in the wake of America's killing of Osama bin Laden might reflect hypocrisy, sure. But this can <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> distinguish from resignation to the fact that Mr Obama didn't submit his case for executing Mr bin Laden to some global civil authority because there isn't one and he didn't have to—because America's the biggest kid on the block and, ultimately, what America says goes. And, if it comes down to it, Britain, France, Italy, Russia and other powerful governments hope America will indulge their own kill-squad adventures with similar approving silences. Of course, if some aggrieved faction in the future seeks retribution through the targeted killing of one of these countries' leaders, that will be raw vengeance, that will be terrorism, that will be an international crime, because, like it or not, that's how it works." ...|$|E
