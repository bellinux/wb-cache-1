5|$|Drogba faced {{problems}} off {{the pitch}} during {{the end of}} the season as his transfer from Marseille to Chelsea in July 2004 came under scrutiny.

5|$|Although most U.S. {{aircraft}} losses {{continued to}} be inflicted by anti-aircraft fire, U.S. Air Force F-105s and Navy A-4 Skyhawks increasingly encountered SAMs and MiGs. North Vietnamese fighters also became a particular problem <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> radar coverage in the Red River Delta region, which allowed the MiGs to surprise the strike forces. Airborne early warning aircraft had difficulty detecting the fighters at low altitudes and the aircraft themselves were difficult to see visually.|$|E

5|$|During {{the time}} of the earthquake, others {{believed}} that the destruction was a result of an underground nuclear explosion. Igor Nesterov, head of seismology of USSR, said the Leninakan seismic station was destroyed so there was no way of knowing whether it received reports of an earthquake coming its way, although Nesterovs' colleagues later said the station was not able to receive reports <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> instruments it carried.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} whether Eorpwald was baptised in East Anglia, Northumbria or Kent, {{but it is very}} likely that Edwin, now the senior ruler, was present as his sponsor. Higham {{suggests}} that <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> proper facilities in East Anglia, it is likely that he was baptised by Paulinus at Edwin's centre of authority in Northumbria. The manner of Eorpwald's conversion indicated that he was a subordinate king and that Edwin was his overlord.|$|E
5|$|Often, the {{migration}} route of a long-distance migrator bird doesn't follow {{a straight line}} between breeding and wintering grounds. Rather, it could follow a hooked or arched line, with detours around geographical barriers. For most land-birds, such barriers could consist in seas, large water bodies or high mountain ranges, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> stopover or feeding sites, {{or the lack of}} thermal columns for broad-winged birds.|$|E

5|$|The stamps {{were sold}} from post-offices {{across the country}} but some were also issued to postmen for sale.

5|$|As {{illustrated}} by the table of matches above, little is known of organised cricket to 1725 <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> newspaper coverage. The shortage of references {{in the latter part}} of the 17th century is due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry. Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries. It follows that equally little is known of clubs and teams, players and locations.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1920s {{the rise}} in motor traffic had put {{pressure}} on the ferry's capacity. A proposed bridge between Shooter's Hill and East Ham was rejected as it would be too obvious a target for wartime bombings, and a third vessel was introduced instead. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a fixed crossing, the Thames became a psychological barrier for those living in the East End of London, who could only use a limited number of routes to cross the river, including the Woolwich Ferry. The lack of a suitable alternative route was instrumental in creating plans for what eventually became the Dartford Crossing further downstream.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Brabant Revolution {{was also}} able to {{continue}} unthreatened <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> external opposition. Soon after the revolution started, Joseph II had fallen ill. Following its defeats {{at the hands of}} the patriot army in the initial campaign, the only Austrian force in the region, taking refuge in Luxembourg, could not challenge the rebels alone. The ongoing conflict with the Ottoman Empire also meant that the bulk of Austria's own army could not be spared to put down the rebellion.|$|E

5|$|It {{is largely}} unknown how baleen whales produce sound <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a melon and vocal cords. In a 2007 study, it was {{discovered}} that the larynx had U-shaped folds which are thought to be similar to vocal cords. They are positioned parallel to air flow, as opposed to the perpendicular vocal cords of terrestrial mammals. These may control air flow and cause vibrations. The walls of the larynx are able to contract which may generate sound with support from the arytenoid cartilages. The muscles surrounding the larynx may expel air rapidly or maintain a constant volume while diving.|$|E

5|$|Maxwell {{ordered his}} first lieutenant, Henry Parkyns Hoppner, to take Lord Amherst {{and his party}} {{in two of the}} boats to an island, known today as Pulo Leat, three miles away. The island's thick {{vegetation}} prevented an assessment of whether it was inhabited, and forced the boat crews to row a further three miles along the shore before finding a suitable landing spot between the mangroves. The rest of the ship's company were evacuated in the remaining boats and a large raft. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> provisions, in particular drinking water, it was decided that Hoppner would continue with Amherst and his embassy to Java, roughly 200 miles to the south.

5|$|Milk was an {{important}} source of animal protein for those who could not afford meat. It would mostly come from cows, but milk from goats and sheep was also common. Plain fresh milk was not consumed by adults except the poor or sick, and was usually reserved for the very young or elderly. Poor adults would sometimes drink buttermilk or whey or milk that was soured or watered down. Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> technology to keep it from spoiling. On occasion it was used in upper-class kitchens in stews, but it was difficult to keep fresh in bulk and almond milk was generally used in its stead.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{positions}} to develop within the code {{was referred to as}} the kick through. The position was unique to the Sheffield game and developed <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> an offside rule. The job of the man playing in the kick through position was to remain near to the opposition's goal and wait for a through ball, a tactic today called cherry picking or goal hanging. By 1871 this position had become modern-day forwards. Cover goals developed in opposition of kick throughs. Despite their name their job was to man mark the kick through.|$|E
5|$|Plain milk was not {{consumed}} by adults except the poor or sick, being {{reserved for the}} very young or elderly, and then usually as buttermilk or whey.
