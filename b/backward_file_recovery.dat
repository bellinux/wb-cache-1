40|$|Most systems {{administrators have}} {{experienced}} a situation where a vital file has accidentally been deleted without a recent backup. In this article, we’ll explore how to recover files in Linux. To begin, however, there are several caveats: 1. The methods described are emergency measures. They do not replace a working backup process to protect your data. You should also consider version control methods to protect your data from accidents. 2. <b>File</b> <b>recovery</b> is usually a time-consuming process, and often is not completely successful. Once a file is deleted, the space it occupied on the hard drive is marked as “available ” and can be overwritten. DO NOT install any <b>file</b> <b>recovery</b> software on the drive that houses the file you want to recover. 3. These data recovery techniques involve elements of luck and timing, in addition to technique. If you’ve suffered an accidental deletion in the first place, luck isn’t necessarily on your side. 4. Even if you do recover the file, {{there is no guarantee}} that it will have the same information that was contained in the original. Inspect anything you retrieve and verify the informatio...|$|R

A variety of popular file types can be found and carved. There {{is no way to}} add unknown file types. The file name is found in the deleted file search, but not in the lost file.

30|$|Based on kernel code reconstruction, {{this paper}} has {{proposed}} an adaptive approach for Linux memory analysis that can address a Linux memory image without information about the kernel version or System.map file.

Our experimental results with a number of Linux memory images show that RAMAnalyzer can automatically identify the kernel version and recovery kernel symbols. Based on the kernel symbols, RAMAnalyzer then extracts live system information about the target system at the time of memory acquisition.|$|R

40|$|Part 3 : FORENSIC TECHNIQUESInternational audienceMany {{techniques}} {{have been proposed}} for <b>file</b> <b>recovery,</b> but recovering fragmented files is still a challenge in digital forensics, especially when the files are damaged. This chapter focuses on JPEG files, {{one of the most}} popular photograph formats, and proposes techniques for recovering partially-damaged standalone JPEG fragments by reconstructing pseudo headers. The techniques deal with missing Huffman tables and sub-sampling factors, estimate the resolution of fragments, assess the image quality of JPEG files with incorrect quantization tables, and create quantization tables that are very close to the correct quantization tables in a reasonable amount of time. Experiments with real camera pictures demonstrate that the techniques can recover standalone fragments accurately and efficiently...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This article {{describes}} the implementation of an intelligent agent that provides recommendations for educational resources in a virtual learning environment (VLE). It aims to support pending (undeveloped) student learning activities. It begins by analyzing the proposed VLE data model entities in the recommender process. The pending student activities are then identified, which constitutes the input information for the agent. By using the attribute-based recommender technique, the information can be processed and resource recommendations can be obtained. These serve as support for pending activity development in the course. To integrate this technique, we used an ontology. This served as support for the semantic annotation of attributes and recommended <b>files</b> <b>recovery.</b> Keywords—Learning activities, educational resource, recommender agent, recommendation technique, ontology.
