They are {{interrupted}} as Armida appears, and wrests Almirena from Rinaldo's embrace. Rinaldo draws his sword {{to defend his}} lover, but a <b>black</b> <b>cloud</b> descends to envelop Armida and Almirena, and they are borne away. Rinaldo mourns {{the loss of his}} loved one. When Goffredo and Eustazio arrive they comfort Rinaldo, and propose they visit a Christian magician who may have the power to save Almirena. Rinaldo, left alone, prays for strength.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of July 16, 1904, a severe thunderstorm produced a strong tornado that touched down around 3:30pm EST in Chappaqua, New York. Residents reported the first indication of the thunderstorm was a large <b>black</b> <b>cloud</b> approaching the region. The sky was reportedly completely dark as torrential rain and high winds commenced. Intense lightning and loud thunder prompted people to seek shelter in their cellars. The tornado tracked directly through Chappaqua before moving towards the Hudson River. Upon reaching the river, the tornado became a waterspout that was powerful enough to uncover the river bed below it. The waterspout eventually dissipated by 4:00pm EST. The tornado was later rated as F3 on the modern-day Fujita scale.|$|E
5|$|Pictures of {{shooting}} the music video in Lyngby, Denmark were released on Aqua's Facebook page on 14 September 2011. A take {{of the video}} was also uploaded on their YouTube channel. The video was officially uploaded on YouTube on 22 September. Directed by Michael Sauer Christensen, it is set in an eerie, empty house that is reminiscent of a horror film, where a <b>black</b> <b>cloud</b> wanders through {{the halls of the}} house. The members wear black and gray clothing in the video, with Nystrom's costume gradually changing throughout. The video ends by the members exiting the house through the roof and transforming into a beam of light shooting into the sky. The video uses a shortened radio edit of the original song, omitting the bridge.|$|E

The cloud obscured Point Misenum near {{at hand and}} the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives, the population began to call {{to each other and}} move back from the coast along the road. A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.|$|E
5|$|A US {{version of}} the music video was {{directed}} by Tim Hope. The video employs a dream-like animated world, with woodland glades, cartoon flowers which bloom instantly and the air full of clockwork-like insects and birds, but with real people embedded within it. On top of a mountain, a woman (Nerys Davies) waters plants inside a house. The band are aboard a horse carriage that travels through a rural landscape. A small coloured bird flies from the carriage up to the house, lands on the woman's windowsill and flaps its wings as if delivering a message. It transforms into a crow and then into a huge black menacing bird. The bird flies over the house and turns into a <b>black</b> <b>cloud,</b> which pours rain onto the land. The rain burns holes on the things it falls on, and crow feathers protrude from the holes. Finally a tornado lifts up the house, spinning it across the sky and then dropping it precisely on a normal suburban street. The video's acclaimed visuals earned Hope an MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction in 2002. It was also nominated for Breakthrough Video.|$|E

25|$|Eruptions at Krakatoa {{started again}} around 16 June with loud explosions {{and a thick}} <b>black</b> <b>cloud</b> {{covering}} the islands for five days. On 24 June, a prevailing east wind cleared the cloud, and two ash columns could be seen issuing from Krakatoa. The seat of the eruption {{is believed to have}} been a new vent or vents that formed between Perboewatan and Danan. The violence of the ongoing eruptions caused tides in the vicinity to be unusually high, and ships at anchor had to be moored with chains. Earthquakes were felt at Anyer, Banten, and ships began to report large pumice masses to the west in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
25|$|Joseph married Angelique McGulpin (Bead-Way-Way or Mecopemequa) in 1794 in Maketoquit's {{village at}} the foot of Maple River rapids, Michigan. Angelique was born about 1780 in Chig-au-mish-kene village on Grand River, Michigan. She was a {{daughter}} of Maketoquit (<b>Black</b> <b>Cloud),</b> the chief of a large band of Grand River Ottawa. He located his main village in what became Essex Township of Shiawassee County, {{on the south side of}} the Maple River, but the band used a winter camp in Lebanon Township of Clinton County (now the village of Maple Rapids) for gathering maple sugar. Children of the marriage were Francis Bailly, born in 1795; Alexis Bailly; born in 1798; and Sophia Bailly, born in 1807. The marriage ended in divorce. Francis remained with Maketoquit's band and Alexis was sent to boarding school in Montreal. Sophia was adopted by a close friend of both parents, fur trader Magdelaine Laframboise, who summered on Mackinac Island and wintered on Grand River (now Lowell, Michigan).|$|E
25|$|The early {{light was}} {{obscured}} by a <b>black</b> <b>cloud</b> through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near {{at hand and}} the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives the population began to call {{to each other and}} move back from the coast along the road. Pliny's mother requested him to abandon her and save his own life, as she was too corpulent and aged to go further, but seizing her hand he led her away as best he could. A rain of ash fell. Pliny found it necessary to shake off the ash periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder. The letter compares the ash to a blanket of snow. Evidently the earthquake and tsunami damage at that location were not severe enough to prevent continued use of the home.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{changes in the}} Battle of the Black Gate: Merry is not present there in the book, Pippin does not kill a troll as he does in the novel (instead, Aragorn does), the eagles fight and defeat some of the mounted Nazgûl (while Frodo putting on the One Ring distracted the Nazgûl, who raced away to Mount Doom in the book before a {{confrontation}} could occur), and Aragorn kills the Mouth of Sauron in the extended edition of the film {{but not in the}} book. There was an even larger change planned: Sauron himself would come out in physical form to battle Aragorn, who would only be saved by the destruction of the Ring. Jackson eventually realised it ignored the point of Aragorn's true bravery in distracting Sauron's army against overwhelming odds, and a computer generated Troll was placed over footage of Sauron in the finished film. In the book, after the destruction of the Ring the spirit of Sauron rises like a <b>black</b> <b>cloud</b> from the ruin of Barad-dûr before being blown away by the wind, but in the film the Eye of Sauron erupts in flame and then explodes as Barad-dûr collapses. As in all of Jackson's Middle-earth adaptions, the eagles do not speak.|$|E

[...] The Ramayana presents a similar description of Kabandha. Kabandha had a broad chest and was without a head or neck. He had only one eye {{on his chest and}} a mouth on his belly. He used his long arms to draw his prey closer. Kabandha is often depicted as a tree.|$|E

500|$|By 1932, Quizapu had {{produced}} many phreatic events and one effusive eruption, but no large Plinian eruptions. This frequency of minor eruptive activity {{proved to be}} a precursor for a major eruption. On 25 January 1932, observers in Malargue saw a large <b>black</b> <b>cloud</b> over the summit. By 9 April, the volcano emitted green gas and started to [...] "bellow like a bull". On April 10, Cerro Azul finally erupted, releasing a towering column or plume of white gas. After 10 AM, the plume turned black with ash and began to form an umbrella shape. The ash was carried by wind into Puesto El Tristan in Argentina, about [...] away, where beginning at 1 PM it rained down for hours. At 4 PM, coarser sandy material and some pumice lapilli began to fall.|$|E
500|$|In Bulgaria, farmers saw {{a horrible}} ala with huge wings and sword-like thick tail in the {{contours}} of a dark cloud. When an ala–cloud overtook the village, villagers peered into the sky hoping to see an imperial eagle emerging there. They believed that the mighty bird with a cross on its back could banish the ala–cloud from the fields. In eastern Bulgaria, ala appeared not in clouds, but in gales and whirlwinds. In other regions of Bulgaria, the ala was seen either as a [...] "bull with huge horns, a <b>black</b> <b>cloud,</b> dark fog or a snake-like monster with six wings and twelve tails". The ala is thought to inhabit remote mountain areas or caves, in which she keeps bad weather. In Bulgarian tradition, thunderstorms and hail clouds were interpreted as a battle between the good dragon or eagle and the evil ala.|$|E
500|$|Yeul {{explains}} {{that every time}} the timeline is changed, the resulting shock kills her; Caius has been driven mad by watching her die repeatedly and seeks to end the process by unleashing the Chaos trapped in Valhalla to destroy all time. Serah, it is revealed, has the same power, and risks death every time she changes the future. Resolving to go on, Serah breaks free of her dream-world and frees Noel from his, {{in which he is}} the last living human after his Yeul dies and Caius leaves for Valhalla. After briefly encountering Lightning, the pair fight Caius, first in 500 AF Academia and then in Valhalla. As they defeat him, he claims to have killed Lightning, then impales himself through the heart on Noel's blade, killing the weakened Etro. When the pair return to Academia in 500 AF, where Vanille and Fang have been rescued from the collapsing pillar and the new Cocoon, named [...] "Bhunivelze", has risen, Serah dies in front of Noel and Hope from the shock of the future changing. Just then, a <b>black</b> <b>cloud</b> erupts from the sky as the Chaos that Etro was keeping trapped breaks free. Lightning is then shown in crystal stasis on the throne of Etro's temple. If the player completes all [...] optional parts of the game, they are shown an additional scene in which Caius is on the throne, declaring that the goddess is gone for good, and that Yeul and he can begin a new life freed from their 'curses'.|$|E
