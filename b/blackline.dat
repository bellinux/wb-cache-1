2500|$|At launch, the Fabia was {{available}} in three trim levels: Classic, Comfort, and Elegance. Later in the Fabia's life the mid-range Comfort model was dropped for the name Ambiente {{to fit in with}} the rest of the range. Other models available throughout the car's lifespan included Ambiente SE, <b>Blackline,</b> Silverline, Sport, Bohemia (estate only, run-out model) and VRS. Various safety features and minor changes were made over time. Easy and Junior models were sold in Eastern European markets where the buying power is lower. Some of these Fabias do not have painted bumpers, side mirrors or gloveboxes. The Junior didn't have power steering and the steering wheel was 'borrowed' from Octavia I. Because of that, it was slightly bigger, with a diameter of 380mm instead of the regular 370mm found on all the other Fabia models. Also sold in such markets is the Fabia Praktik, which is a panel van version of the Fabia with the rear windows and seats removed. A lesser powered version of the 1.4 MPI with just [...] is also sold in Eastern Europe.|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{blueprints}} {{have largely}} been replaced by more modern, less expensive printing methods and digital displays. In the early 1940s, cyanotype blueprint began to be supplanted by diazo prints, also known as whiteprints, which have blue lines on a white background; thus these drawings are also called blue-lines or bluelines. Other comparable dye-based prints are known as <b>blacklines.</b>|$|R
30|$|Planning and {{conducting}} prescribed burns, especially large ones, require intensive coordination among many partners to meet objectives {{and to ensure}} the safety of personnel. The Baker II burn, for example, was conducted by personnel from the Coronado National Forest, other national forests, BLM, US Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and the Animas Foundation, which operates the Diamond A Ranch in New Mexico. The Diamond A Ranch conducts an independent prescribed burning program on its private lands. The NRCS and Forest Service’s Rocky Mountain Research Station assisted with planning, and the Mexican government sent observers and offered the use of a helicopter. Ignitions were done on the ground from prepared <b>blacklines</b> and from a helicopter in some inaccessible areas. The prescribed burns created a mosaic of grass and wooded areas and were generally successful in achieving the objectives.|$|R

30|$|Large-scale {{prescribed}} burns {{were conducted}} in three replicate 65 ha pastures during the fall (October or November) each year during 2007 to 2010. We burned one quarter (16 ha) of each pasture each year in a rotation, with a different quarter burned each year. Pastures were grazed by cattle at a moderate stocking rate of 0.65 animal unit months (AUM) per hectare during May to October of each year, which is the stocking rate at which these pastures had been grazed in years prior to initiation of the burn study. (See Augustine and Derner [2014] for effects of this prescribed burn program on cattle foraging distribution and weight gain.) The three replicate burns were conducted on the same afternoon each year, using the same methods as the small-scale burns, except with wider <b>blacklines.</b> Prior to each burn, fuel loads were measured by harvesting all standing plant biomass within ten randomly located 0.25 m 2 quadrats in each burn site. During each burn, we again measured temperatures of the headfire with 6 Omega type-J thermocouples placed 1 cm above ground level and attached to dataloggers that recorded temperature at 1 sec intervals. During 2007 to 2010, we conducted a total of 12 prescribed burns in these pastures under four different weather and fuel load conditions.|$|R

30|$|Burns {{occurred}} at two different locations, {{each of which}} had a different spatial scale. Hereafter, we refer to the first location as the small-scale burns, and the second location as the large-scale burns. Small-scale prescribed burns occurred {{in a set of}} 20 400 m 2 plots established in 2006 in upland shortgrass steppe that had not been grazed by livestock for the previous five years, and remained ungrazed throughout the study period. Four prescribed burn treatments with four replicate plots per treatment were implemented during 2006 to 2013, consisting of: (1) plots burned annually in late March or early April, (2) plots burned annually in October or November, (3) plots burned once every three years in late March or early April, and (4) plots burned once every three years in October or November. Hereafter we refer to these as annual spring, annual fall, triennial spring, and triennial fall burns, respectively. Spring burns occurred prior to any green-up in the dominant grass species, blue grama, and fall burns occurred after complete senescence of aboveground blue grama biomass. For each burn, we established a wet-line on the two downwind boundaries, initiated backburns to create 1 m to 2 m wide <b>blacklines</b> on these boundaries, and then burned the remainder of the plot with a headfire lit with hand-held drip torches from the upwind boundaries. Plant responses to the burns conducted during 2006 to 2007 are reported by Scheintaub et al. (2009). The four plots within a given treatment were always burned on the same afternoon, within a period of approximately two hours. In years in which both annual and triennial burns occurred, all eight plots were burned on the same afternoon. Although annual and triennial burns of the same season occurred under the same weather conditions, they differed in terms of fuel loads and hence were considered separately in analyses. Prior to each burn, fuel loads were measured by harvesting all standing plant biomass within two randomly located 0.25 m 2 quadrats in each plot. Litter, which we define as detached biomass lying on the ground surface, was not measured. During each burn, we measured temperatures of the headfire using six glass-insulated, Omega type-J wire thermocouples over-braided with stainless steel. Thermocouples were placed 1 cm above ground level and attached to dataloggers that recorded temperature at 1 sec intervals (Jacoby et al. 1992). During each burn, we also recorded mean wind speed, relative humidity, and air temperature. For analyses, we calculated mean weather parameters, fuel load, and temperature responses across all four replicate burns within a given treatment. No temperatures were recorded in 2006 or 2007, and no data from those burns are included here. During 2008 to 2013, we conducted a total of 60 prescribed burns on these plots under 15 different weather and fuel load conditions.|$|R
