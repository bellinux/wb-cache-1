5|$|At {{the end of}} this week's episode, Rick is of {{the mind}} that they're square; they've got {{everything}} out in the open, they've each said their piece and they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and they're riding back in that car and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E
5|$|Bond goes to Osato Chemicals to meet Mr. Osato himself, {{masquerading}} {{as a potential}} new buyer. Osato humours Bond, but after their meeting he orders his secretary, Helga Brandt, to have him killed. Outside the building, assassins open fire on Bond before Aki rescues him again. Bond and Aki drive to Kobe, where the Ning-Po is docked. They investigate the company's dock facilities and discover that the ship was delivering elements for rocket fuel. They are discovered, but Bond eludes the henchmen until Aki gets away; however, Bond is captured and knocked out. He wakes, tied up in SPECTRE operative Helga Brandt's cabin on the Ning-Po. In a sexy cocktail dress, she interrogates Bond, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> of managing to bribe his way to freedom when she suddenly chooses to enjoy herself by kissing and freeing him {{in order to have}} sex. Brandt then flies Bond to Tokyo, but en route she sets off a flare in the plane and bails out, finally persuaded to kill him. Bond manages to land the plane.|$|E

At a press conference in 2013, Padilla said he never imagined ending up in entertainment, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> that he is in show business for a more important reason since his family went through financial difficulties.|$|E
25|$|As a moral philosopher, Mosterín {{does not}} believe in the {{existence}} of intrinsic or natural rights (neither for animals in general nor for humans in particular), <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> that any political society can create rights through legislative action. Following Hume and Darwin, and taking into account Giacomo Rizzolatti’s results on mirror neurons, Mosterín suggests that our inborn capacity for compassion, fed by knowledge and empathy, is a more solid basis for the moral consideration of non-human animals than abstract and uncheckable speculations about intrinsic rights. This fits his emphasis on the relevance of moral emotions (like compassion) to ethics, somehow comparable with the role played by perception in empirical science.|$|E
500|$|Chris meets Aidan when he {{is brought}} into the {{hospital}} following a [...] "vicious beating". Aidan provides a source of kindness and support for Chris. He later takes his car to the local garage to be serviced and flirts with Chris, who is initially unaware {{of what is going}} on. Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major) attempts to help Chris by asking Aidan if he is gay or straight, which leads to embarrassment for them all. The appearance of Chris' father, George (Lliam Amor), makes the situation worse and when Aidan asks Chris out for a drink, he turns him down. Mason told an Inside Soap writer [...] "George is only just starting to accept that his son is gay, so when Aidan invites Chris for a drink, Chris turns him down out of fear of what his dad will think." [...] Chris becomes intrigued by Aidan, but he also unsure what to do as he has never had a boyfriend before and it is all new to him. Natasha urges Chris to [...] "face his fears" [...] and she decides to play matchmaker at a barbecue they are all attending. Chris bonds with Aidan, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> he missed his chance when Aidan goes on a date with someone else. Mason revealed that this leads to some new tension between the characters.|$|E

2500|$|Socrates repeats {{his claim}} that formal accusations of {{corruption}} and impiety shall not destroy him, but that he shall be harmed by the prejudiced gossip and slanders of his enemies. He tells the court of being unafraid of death, because his true concern is in acting ethically. That people who fear death are showing their ignorance, because death {{might be a good}} thing, but that most people fear death as an evil thing, when they cannot possibly know death to be either good or evil. Socrates says that his wisdom is in being aware that he is ignorant: “I am wiser than this man; it is likely that neither of us knows anything worthwhile, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> he knows something, when he does not.” Apology, 21d.|$|E
2500|$|Non-reductive physicalism {{is a form}} of {{property}} dualism in which it is asserted that all mental states are causally reducible to physical states. One argument for this has been made in the form of anomalous monism expressed by Donald Davidson, where it is argued that mental events are identical to physical events, and there can be strict law-governed causal relationships. Another argument for this has been expressed by John Searle, who is the advocate of a distinctive form of physicalism he calls biological naturalism. His view is that although mental states are ontologically irreducible to physical states, they are causally reducible (see causality). He has acknowledged that [...] "to many people" [...] his views and those {{of property}} dualists look a lot alike. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> the comparison is misleading.|$|E
2500|$|Ever {{since that}} time, people run around {{saying they are}} looking for their other half because they are really trying to recover their primal nature. The women who were {{separated}} from women run after their own kind, thus creating lesbians. The men split from other men also run after their own kind and love being embraced by other men (191e). Those that come from original androgynous beings are the men and women that engage in heterosexual love. He says some people think homosexuals are shameless, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> they are the bravest, most manly of all, as evidenced by the fact that only they grow up to be politicians (192a), and that many heterosexuals are adulterous and unfaithful (191e). Aristophanes then claims that when two people who were separated from each other find each other, they never again want to be separated (192c). This feeling is like a riddle, and cannot be explained. [...] Aristophanes ends on a cautionary note. [...] He says that men should fear the gods, and not neglect to worship them, lest they wield the axe again and we have to go about hopping on one leg, split apart again(193a). If man works with the god of Love, they will escape this fate and instead find wholeness.|$|E

The song was co-written by Michael W. Smith, David Mullen, and Cindy Morgan. On February 21, 2010 TobyMac and Michael Tait, along with the Newsboys, performed the song [...] "Jesus Freak" [...] during Winter Jam in Nashville, Tennessee. In June 2010 Kevin Max tweeted {{that he was trying}} to arrange a reunion tour for [...] "perhaps" [...] 2011. On August 3, 2010 [...] "Jesus Freak" [...] was released as a download to the Rock Band store. The song has a [...] "Supervision Recommended" [...] rating. The Rock Band store states that [...] "Supervision Recommended" [...] tracks [...] "may contain suggestive lyrics and the infrequent use of strong language," [...] and the song is not playable in LEGO Rock Band due to the rating. In October 2010 Kevin Max discussed the prospect of new DC Talk music. He admitted that he would love to make more music <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> [...] "that time has passed us by...". He then explained, [...] "as individuals we are so different in our approaches that it might be quite a process." [...] Kevin expressed interest in a reunion tour for the fans.|$|E
