The highest pre-strain values were reached within the necking area. Tensile tests on rectangular samples were performed, then reduced samples were cut out and submitted to bending. A Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system was used to measure the maximum local strains reached during both tests. The evolution of the applied load on the <b>bending</b> <b>tool</b> versus its displacement showed that a rupture in bending was obtained for tensile pre-strains higher than 0. 25, as evidenced by a load drop.

40|$|Sheet metal bending is {{a process}} in which bends are formed using a {{combination}} of a punch and a die. <b>Bending</b> <b>tools</b> need to satisfy the following two criteria: (1) tools should be able to withstand bending forces, and (2) tool shapes should be such that there is no tool-part interference. In this paper, we describe a systematic methodology for automatically synthesizing a punch shape {{that can be used to}} produce more than one type of part. We create a parametric geometric model of possible punches. This parametric model describes a family of possible punch shapes. Using the geometric models of various given part types and a parametric punch model, we automatically generate constraints on punch parameters that eliminate the possibility of part-tool interference. We use mixed integer programming techniques to solve these constraints and identify parameters of a punch shape that can work for the given set of parts. Finally, we perform strength analysis of the designed punch to verify that [...] ...|$|R

The process involves optimising the sequence of designated bends {{taking into account the}} total processing and handling time, avoiding collisions of the sheet metal with tools and machine and respecting the dimensional accuracy constraints of the part. Experienced operators employ expert rules to define possible different feasible sub-optimal sequences that lead to the desired final shape. The expert knowledge is replaced in this work by stochastic search using a classic genetic algorithm. In addition, dimensional accuracy issues are introduced by determining machine stopper positions.

40|$|While the bending {{sequence}} planning {{has been}} intensively studied, {{design of the}} motion path of a sheet metal part in the bending operation tends to be ignored by researchers. Because during the bending operation, the space for maneuvering a sheet metal part is very small, collisions between the part and <b>bending</b> <b>tools</b> are likely to occur. When a robot is used to handle the part, {{the role of an}} automatic path-planning tool becomes more significant. In this study, an evolutionary path-planning approach for robot-assisted handling of sheet metal parts in bending is firstly proposed and implemented. The proposed approach globally searches the motion path space to identify feasible paths. Collision detection algorithms based on segment intersection are used to check if the generated paths are feasible or infeasible. This method can automatically design feasible handling operations for a robot.
