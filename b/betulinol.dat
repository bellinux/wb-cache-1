40|$|By {{removing}} the primary fines from an oxygen-delignified mill birch pulp, a fiber fraction was obtained having low metals content and no extractives. After DEDeD bleaching the fiber fraction had somewhat higher brightness and better brightness stability than the birch pulp containing the primary fines. The fines fraction was enriched with lignin, extractives, xylan, and metals. Bleaching the fines fraction in a QQP sequence {{did not affect}} the extractives, whereas a ZeQP sequence clearly reduced the extractives content. In a biorefinery concept, the fines fraction could be utilized as a source of xylan, fatty acids, sterols, and <b>betulinol.</b> Another possibility is to use the fines fraction unbleached or separately bleached as a bonding material in various fiber furnishes...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} lipophilic extractives in the hexane extracts from grey alder bark, knotwood, and cones has been investigated by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The efficiency of two extraction methods was compared. The highest amount of lipophilic extractives (about 9 % of o. d. material) was observed in grey alder cone, while the lowest (about 3 %) was found in knotwood. The three different morphological parts of alder showed significant differences {{not only in the}} content but also in composition of extractives, namely fatty acids, triglycerides, and triterpenes. The main identified compounds were triterpenoids (lupen- 3 -one, lupeol, betulone, <b>betulinol,</b> and betulinic acid) in bark, and triglycerides in cones. The major group in knotwood was free fatty acids (mainly linoleic acid, 18 : 2) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study a specific class of extractives existing in lignocellulosic biomass and more precisely in wood materials, and their thermochemical behavior during pyrolysis. The focus was centered on the class of terpenes and terpenoids; specifically two model compounds, abietic acid and <b>betulinol,</b> were chosen to represent the subclasses of di- and triterpenoids, respectively. The model compounds were investigated via pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and the main objective was to study their product profiles and characteristic fragmentations, {{as well as the}} influence of specific variables (pyrolysis temperature and time) on pyrolysis products. Pyrolysis experiments were performed at three different temperatures (700, 600, and 500 °C) with two different pyrolysis times (20 and 5 seconds). The MS spectra indicated that the fragments obtained from abietic acid and <b>betulinol,</b> under the chosen conditions, were mainly aromatics in nature, especially at the higher temperature, whereas at the lower temperature different fragmentation products of the original molecule were also present. Among the pyrolytic products, benzene, indene, naphthalene, and their derivatives, mainly methylated, were dominant and common to both model compounds. Phenanthrene derivatives were only found during pyrolysis of abietic acid, due to the stability of the phenanthrene carbon skeleton, which is a characteristic of tricyclic resin acids. A general trend could be seen at the higher pyrolysis temperature and longer time enhancing the formation of the detected compounds. Overall, pyrolysis temperature was shown to be a more influential parameter than pyrolysis time. The relevance of this type of research relies on the fact that investigations on model compounds can improve the understanding of the whole biomass behavior under different pyrolytic conditions. In addition to that, studies on the thermochemical behavior of lignocellulosic materials have a key role in evaluating the feasibility of producing certain fuels and chemicals from this renewable and abundant resource. This can offer an attractive opportunity for industry in the manufacture of various wood-based chemicals, fuels, and similar products, as an alternative to those derived from fossil resources...|$|E
30|$|The {{quantitative}} analysis of TOFAs {{was performed by}} GC/FID according to Lappi and Alén [3]. The relative mass-based response factors used between the GC peak areas derived from internal standards (ISs), heneicosanoic acid and <b>betulinol,</b> and those of compounds were equal to 1. α-GISAL and the product esters were also determined by GC/FID; in each case, the dried sample was dissolved in toluene (1 : 100 v/v) and then per(trimethylsilyl)ated {{with a mixture of}} 0.5  mL N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) containing 1  % of trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) in 1  mL pyridine prior to chromatographic analysis. Xylitol was used as an IS. The identification of the peaks was conducted by a gas chromatograph equipped with a mass selective detector (GC/MSD). The results were analyzed with the Enhanced ChemStation G 1701 CA (version C. 00.00, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) software and the mass spectra were compared to those in the Wiley 7 n database. The relative mass-based response factors in relation to that of the IS (1.0) were determined by the separately-purified mono- and dilaurate of α-GISA using GC/FID under the same conditions as those in GC/MSD; they were 3.5 and 3.7, respectively. These values were also used for the quantitative determination of other fatty acid mono- and diesters.|$|E
