40|$|In the {{manufacturing}} of metal components both wear and corrosion {{have to be}} considered. In particular corrosion {{is a very important}} problem in the aeronautic field, were the aluminum alloys are widespread used, but are affected by several corrosion typologies. Furthermore nowadays carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) are finding an increasing use, but they can induce galvanic corrosion phenomena when coupled with aluminum alloys. To overcome this problem corrosion resistant coating are used on aluminum components. Otherwise titanium alloys have a very high corrosion resistance and furthermore no galvanic corrosion phenomena arise when coupled with CFRP. On these premises the realization of a titanium coating on aluminum components could allow the use of aluminum alloys coupled with CFRP and improve the corrosion resistance of the above mentioned alloys.

Chapter 1 gives an exposition of concepts and techniques used {{in understanding the}} electronic structure and bonding in some chemically interesting molecules. Heuristics concepts like isolobal analogy and electron counting rules are used in analyzing and predicting some novel chemical systems. A brief description of computational techniques such as density functional theory (DFT) based methods are used to quantitatively examine the structures and energies of these systems. In chapter 2 we present a critical analysis of bonding in neutral and dianionic stannadiphospholes and compare the potential energy surfaces with the isoelectronic Cp+ and Cp- species. The analysis indicates that Sn can be a better isolobal analogue to P+ than to BH or CH+. In chapter 3 we present new strategy to stabilize B 2 H 4 in planar configuration using transition metal fragments. This requires the metal to donate two electrons into the empty B-B π orbital. Such complexes present a unique case study to the classical DCD model of metal-π complex. In chapter 4 we study the bonding in some recently synthesized metallaboranes which does not follow conventional electron counting rules. The complex and non-canonical nature of these metallaboranes feature some unique bonding patterns which are elucidated using theoretical techniques. In the final chapter we present new approach to <b>build</b> metal <b>coated</b> boron fullerenes.

In our experiments, particles landing on a polished stainless steel surface at a temperature below 300 °C splashed and formed irregular splats, whereas those deposited on substrates heated above 400 °C formed round disk splats. Simulations showed that formation of fingers around the periphery of a spreading drop is caused by the presence of a solid layer. Droplets that spread completely before the onset of solidification will not splash. To sufficiently delay the instant at which solidification started in our simulations to obtain disk splats, we had to increase the thermal contact resistance between the droplet and the substrate by an order of magnitude. We measured the thickness of the oxide layer on the test surfaces used in our experiments and confirmed that heating them creates an oxide layer on the surface that increases the thermal contact resis-tance.

40|$|In this study, microfibrillated {{cellulose}} (MFC) {{was applied}} {{in an aqueous}} suspension as a coating material on paper substrates. Two different coating techniques were used: rod coating and size press. The MFC suspension used has a high water content and water is known to deteriorate {{the properties of the}} paper, so water treated paper substrates were prepared as references to give an indication of the effects that the processing has on the final properties of the coated papers. The structure of the MFC coating and associated surface properties were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by measuring the thickness and the roughness of the coated substrates. A tool to visualise the distribution of the MFC was developed and the tensile properties ofthe MFC coated substrates were characterised. Resistance to air, oxygen and water vapour permeationas well as water and grease absorption were used to describe the barrier properties of the coated papers. The MFC coated paper substrates exhibited a higher roughness than the reference paper substrate. This was due to the sensitivity of the substrate to water and not from the coating material it self since the water treated paper substrates showed an even higher roughness than the MFC coated substrates. The latter showed slightly increased tensile properties compared to the reference paper substrates, and most importantly, reduced air permeance and grease absorption (- 100 % and - 84 % respectively); for the rod coated paper substrate with 3 g⁄m 2 coat weight. The water vapour transmission rate was also decreased with the applied MFC coatings. Advantages and drawbacks were identified for the coating techniques. The rod coating allowed a good control of the coat weight in a range of 1 to 3 g⁄m 2. However, the Mayer rod and the high viscosity of the MFC suspension caused poor MFC distribution and a coating which reproduced the rod pattern. With the size press, coat weights around 1 g⁄m 2 were reached.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis has been directed to the study {{and the development of}} a new thermal spray process now known as the"SPS" (Suspension Plasma Spraying), in which the raw material to be treated is initially a liquid suspension. The SPS process is employed either for the preparation of thick coating or to the production of spherical and dense powders. The principle of SPS is the axial injection of a suspension into the plasma core by gas atomization. The atomization droplets are successively dried, melted and accelerated in the plasma plume. Finally, melt droplets strike a substrate and solidify to <b>build</b> the <b>coating</b> (deposition route) or are solidified in-flight and are then collected from within the reactor (powder route). The SPS process is best achieved with the use of r. f. thermal plasma technology and has been applied to the complex shape forming of ceramic materials: e. g. hydroxyapatite (HA), Ca[subscript] 10 (PO 4) [subscript] 6 (OH) [subscript] 2. HA, which is a bioceramic used in various biomedical applications such as bone substitute. The original chemical synthesis of the HA is a key step for the control of physical and chemical properties of the HA suspension which in turn are fundamental to the success of the entire SPS process. HA decomposes at elevated temperatures. With proper control of the plasma spraying parameters (i. e. the nature of the plasma gas and its composition, plasma power level, pressure, etc), the in-flight plasma decomposition can be minimized. Moreover it is possible to control the coating texture, its crystallinity and adhesion strength while maintaining high deposition rates (> 150 [micrometre]/min). The morphology of powders prepared by the SPS technique and the size of resultant powders depends strongly on the atomization parameters of the spray suspension in the plasma. Water promotes the stabilization of HA during the plasma treatment and therefore helps to limit its in-flight decomposition. The SPS process is a potentially powerful technology providing in-flight reaction routes for new materials synthesis and shaping, both as powders and as finished coatings. A further advantage of the SPS process concerns its economics through the used of a reduced number of process steps required in comparison to conventional plasma spray process...|$|R
40|$|A {{continuum}} {{model that}} possesses several desirable {{features of the}} electrical conduction process in carbon-nanotube (CNT) based nanocomposites is developed. Three basic elements are included: (i) percolation threshold, (ii) interface effects, and (iii) tunneling-assisted interfacial conductivity. We approach the first one through the selection of an effective medium theory. We approach the second one {{by the introduction of}} a diminishing layer of interface with an interfacial conductivity to <b>build</b> a thinly <b>coated</b> CNT. The third one is introduced through the observation that interface conductivity can be enhanced by electron tunneling which in turn can be facilitated with the formation of CNT networks. We treat this last issue in a continuum fashion by taking the network formation as a statistical process that can be represented by Cauchy's probability density function. The outcome is a simple and yet widely useful model that can simultaneously capture all these fundamental characteristics. It is demonstrated that, without considering the interface effect, the predicted conductivity would be too high, and that, without accounting for the additional contribution from the tunneling-assisted interfacial conductivity, the predicted conductivity beyond the percolation threshold would be too low. It is with the consideration of all three elements that the theory can fully account for the experimentally measured data. We further use the developed model to demonstrate that, despite the anisotropy of the intrinsic CNT conductivity, it is its axial component along the CNT direction that dominates the overall conductivity. This theory is also proved that, even with a totally insulating matrix, it is still capable of delivering non-zero conductivity beyond the percolation threshold.

The creation of clathrin-coated vesicles demands interplay between the plasma membrane lipids, cargo molecules and the proteins that <b>build</b> up the <b>coat.</b> This thesis deals with the identification and characterisation of sorting nexin 9 (SNX 9) as a novel component of the endocytic machinery. SNX 9 belongs to a large family of proteins based {{on the presence of}} a PX domain. In addition, SNX 9 harbours an SH 3 domain followed by a region with predicted low-complexity and a C-terminal BAR homology domain. Binding studies demonstrated that SNX 9 interacted with the endocytic core components clathrin and AP- 2 and dynamin- 2, a GTPase known to be crucial for vesicle scission. The C-terminal region bound to phosphatidylinositols and targeted SNX 9 to artificial liposomes and cellular membranes. Consistent with a role in endocytosis, a large portion of SNX 9 co-localised with AP- 2 and dynamin- 2 but not with markers for early endosomes, Golgi. Over-expression of truncated variants of SNX 9 in K 562 and HeLa cells interfered with the uptake of transferrin. SNX 9 recycles between a membrane-bound and a cytosolic pool. In cytosol, SNX 9 formed a resting complex together with dynamin- 2 and the metabolic enzyme aldolase. Activation for membrane binding involved ATP hydrolysis and correlated with phosphorylation of SNX 9 and the release of aldolase. Aldolase bound to a tryptophan-containing acidic region near the clathrin and AP- 2 motifs and blocked lipid binding of purified SNX 9 derivatives. SNX 9 was required for membrane targeting of dynamin 2 in vitro and knockdown of SNX 9 in HeLa cells by RNAi resulted in impaired membrane localisation. Together these results argue strongly for a role of SNX 9 in recruiting and linking of dynamin- 2 to sites of vesicle creation...|$|R
