40|$|International audienceVisibly pushdown automata {{are special}} pushdown automata whose stack {{behavior}} {{is driven by}} the input symbols according to a partition of the alphabet. We show that it is decidable for <b>a</b> given <b>visibly</b> pushdown automaton whether it is equivalent to <b>a</b> <b>visibly</b> counter automaton, i. e. an automaton that uses its stack only as counter. In particular, this allows to decide whether <b>a</b> given <b>visibly</b> pushdown language is a regular restriction of the set of well-matched words, meaning that the language can be accepted by a finite automaton if only well-matched words are considered as input...|$|R

He threatened to drive into Buemi's rear-end the next time he was anywhere near him. Buemi confronted Abt shortly after and accused the latter of hitting him deliberately. When Buemi walked away, he turned to Abt and called him [...] "a dirty guy". More than half an hour after the rant, Buemi called Audi Sport Abt [...] "a dirty team" [...] through the press and claimed the company went beyond what was allowed in the rules. Frijns was perplexed by Buemi's confrontation as he was expecting to be thanked by Buemi and believed he avoided being caught up in a more serious incident in the opening lap, [...] "I had actually already taken him before I turned in and I felt a small touch on the left rear but nothing much. Then five or six laps later he was behind me and I chose to let him go so I don’t know what he is crying about." [...] Ten days after the ePrix, Buemi apologised to his team and both Andretti drivers on Twitter.|$|R
