5|$|Baker's yeast or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a {{unicellular}} fungus, {{is used to}} make {{bread and}} other wheat-based products, such as pizza dough and dumplings. Yeast species of the genus Saccharomyces are also used to produce alcoholic beverages through fermentation. Shoyu koji mold (Aspergillus oryzae) is an essential ingredient in brewing Shoyu (soy sauce) and sake, and the preparation of miso, while Rhizopus species are used for making tempeh. Several of these fungi are domesticated species that were bred or selected according to their capacity to ferment food without producing harmful mycotoxins (see below), which are produced <b>by</b> <b>very</b> closely related Aspergilli.

5|$|Hobbs was an {{occasional}} medium-paced bowler who bowled a good length {{and made the}} ball swing. Some critics judged {{him to be a}} potentially good bowler, but both Surrey and England were reluctant for him to bowl regularly, fearing it would affect his batting. As a fielder, Hobbs improved greatly from his early days. He fielded in the covers and was expert in cutting off potential runs and returning the ball quickly to the wicket-keeper. Contemporaries believed him {{to be one of the}} best cover fielders there had been, and remarked on his powers of anticipation in getting to the ball. They also noted he sometimes deceived batsmen with his casual attitude and occasional deliberate mis-fields; these would be followed <b>by</b> <b>very</b> sharp fielding which often produced a run out.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lane {{continued}} to organize with its 9mile (14km) wide eye surrounded <b>by</b> <b>very</b> deep convection, and the storm strengthened further to reach peak winds of 125mph (205km/h) by midday on September 16. It turned unexpectedly {{to the northeast}} , and at 1915UTC on the 16th, Hurricane Lane made landfall in a sparsely populated region of Sinaloa, 20miles (32km) southeast of El Dorado. This made Lane the most intense hurricane to strike Mexico since Hurricane Kenna in the 2002 season. The combination of the mountainous terrain of Mexico and increasing west-southwesterly wind shear caused the storm to rapidly weaken, and the storm dissipated on September 17. The remnants of Lane later moved into Texas, United States.|$|E

5|$|Like other thyreophorans, Scelidosaurus was herbivorous. However, {{while some}} later ornithischian groups possessed teeth capable of {{grinding}} plant material, Scelidosaurus had smaller, less complex leaf-shaped teeth suitable for cropping vegetation and jaws capable of only vertical movement, {{due to a}} short jaw joint. Paul Barrett concluded that Scelidosaurus fed with a puncture-crush system of tooth-on-tooth action, with a precise but simple up-and-down jaw movement, in which the food was mashed between the inner side of the upper teeth and the outer side of the lower teeth, without the teeth actually touching each other as shown <b>by</b> <b>very</b> long vertical wear facets on the lower teeth alone.|$|E
5|$|Methoxyflurane is an {{extremely}} potent and highly lipid-soluble anesthetic agent, characterized <b>by</b> <b>very</b> slow induction (onset of action) and emergence (offset or dissipation) times.

Methoxyflurane has powerful analgesic (pain-relieving) properties at well below full anesthetic doses. It was utilized in self-administration devices for obstetric analgesia, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today.|$|E

5|$|The Pondicherry shark has {{a robust}} build and a {{moderately}} long, pointed snout. The large and circular eyes {{are equipped with}} nictitating membranes. Each nostril is broad with a small, narrow nipple-shaped lobe on the anterior rim. The arched mouth lacks conspicuous furrows or enlarged pores at the corners. The upper and lower jaws contain 14–15 and 12–14 tooth rows on either side respectively; in addition, there are one or two rows of small teeth at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw midpoints). The upper teeth have a single narrow, smooth-edged central cusp, flanked on both sides <b>by</b> <b>very</b> large serrations. The lower teeth are narrower and more upright than the uppers, and may be smooth to finely serrated. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly long.|$|E

With the detainees loaded on trucks, the ground convoy force attempted to reach the first crash site. Unable to find it amongst the narrow, winding alleyways, the convoy came under devastating small arms and RPG fire. The convoy had to return to base after suffering numerous casualties, and sustaining substantial damage to their vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ignacio {{continued}} to quickly intensify after becoming a hurricane, and reached peak winds of 105mph (165km/h) later on August 24 while located within 30miles (48km/h) {{off the coast}} of Baja California Sur. Upon reaching peak strength, the hurricane possessed a 12mile (19km) wide eye surrounded <b>by</b> <b>very</b> deep convection. The National Hurricane Center predicted it to attain major hurricane status and potentially reach significantly higher winds if the center remained over open water. However, it turned to the northwest and paralleled the Baja California Peninsula a short distance offshore, resulting in a steady weakening trend due to its interaction with the high terrain. On August 25 Ignacio made landfall just east of La Paz with winds of 80mph (130km/h). It rapidly weakened over land, first deteriorating to a tropical storm 12hours after landfall and later to a tropical depression about a day after moving ashore. Ignacio continued northwestward across the peninsula, and dissipated on August 28 while located in northwestern Baja California Sur.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the {{depression}} was forecast to reach maximum strength as {{a tropical storm}} before weakening, and only the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's hurricane model predicted it to attain hurricane status. However, low amounts of wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures favored further intensification. After being previously removed from the primary thunderstorm activity, the circulation became situated beneath a persistent area of deep convection. It is estimated the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Kenneth early on September 15. The storm quickly developed banding features—spiral rain showers of convection—as its convection formed into a central area of deep convection. These were all signs for further development, and Kenneth attained hurricane status early on September 16. By September 17, the hurricane had finished an eyewall replacement cycle, meaning its original eye {{was replaced by a}} larger, better defined eye. As a result, it quickly intensified and attained major hurricane status. With a 23mile (37km) wide eye surrounded <b>by</b> <b>very</b> cold cloud tops, Kenneth strengthened to reach peak sustained winds of 135mph (215km/h), a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, on September 18 about 1725miles (2790km) east of the Big Island of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|On 26 August, the {{aircraft}} carrier HMS Victorious sailed from Singapore with her two escorting destroyers, HMS Caesar and HMS Cavendish, bound for Fremantle in Western Australia. The genuine purpose of the voyage is still disputed, but {{it is probable that}} the carrier group was passing through as a show of strength to Indonesia {{in the wake of the}} Pontian landings as well as the routine 'goodwill visit' that the vessel was purportedly making to Britain's ally. The task force was surprisingly met <b>by</b> <b>very</b> little Indonesian response as it passed through their territorial waters, the carrier reporting only a single Tupolev Tu-16 aircraft making a flyover as the warships passed through the Sunda Strait the following day. The ownership of the Strait itself was complex, as Indonesia claimed it despite British assertions that it was an international waterway that her warships could pass through at any time. Following standard British procedure in such a situation, the British Military Attache in Jakarta had telephoned ahead to the Indonesian Director of Naval Intelligence that the squadron would be passing through Indonesian territory without seeking their clearance, a precedent set the last time Britain had used the Straits in October 1963. This policy, engineered by the Foreign Office, had the dual purpose of notifying the Indonesians of a possibly provocative action without recognizing what they thought to be exaggerated claims on international waters. The return date to Singapore was not set exactly at the time of sailing but was to be sometime in mid-September.|$|E
5|$|That a large {{population}} remained in residence in the north sector of Mundo Perdido during the Terminal Classic {{is evidenced by the}} quantity of burials of differing gender and age. Some were interred inside collapsed buildings or in casual graves. They were usually accompanied <b>by</b> <b>very</b> few funerary offerings, generally bone and lithic artefacts. The dense occupation of the north sector, which included elite activity, continued for at least a hundred years after the abandonment of the rest of Tikal and is perhaps linked to the nearby water supply and to continued ritual activity at Temple III. While the northern portion of the Mundo Perdido continued in use, the rest of the complex was partially abandoned. The occupation of the Mundo Perdido came to an end in the Terminal Classic and very few traces of Postclassic activity have been recovered, limited to a few ceramic finds in Structure 3D-43 to the north.|$|E
