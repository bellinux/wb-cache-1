5|$|Ice had to {{be stored}} at {{multiple}} points between harvesting and its final use by a customer. One method for doing this was the construction of ice houses to hold the product, typically either shortly after the ice was first harvested or at regional depots after it had <b>been</b> <b>shipped</b> out. Early ice houses were relatively small, but later storage facilities were the size of large warehouses and contained much larger quantities of ice.|$|E

5|$|After the victory, a {{prize crew}} was put aboard Chesapeake. The {{commander}} of the prize, Lieutenant Falkiner, had {{a good deal of}} trouble from the restive Americans, who outnumbered his own men. He had some {{of the leaders of the}} unrest transferred to Shannon in the leg-irons that had, ironically, <b>been</b> <b>shipped</b> aboard Chesapeake to deal with expected British prisoners.

5|$|When the Alsos Mission found {{documentation}} {{in office}} of Union Minière in Antwerp that indicated over 1,000 tons of refined uranium {{had been sent}} to Germany, but about 150 tons still remained at Olen, Belgium, Groves sent Furman back to Europe with orders to secure the Olen cache. The Alsos Mission located 68 tons there, but another 80 tons was missing, having <b>been</b> <b>shipped</b> to France in 1940 ahead of the German invasion of Belgium. Groves had the Olen uranium shipped to England and, ultimately, to the United States.|$|E
5|$|While {{waiting for}} an {{opportunity}} to launch this operation, the Alsos Mission learned that uranium ore that had been taken from Belgium in 1944 had <b>been</b> <b>shipped</b> to the Wirtschaftliche Forschungsgesellschaft (WiFO) plant in Stassfurt, which was captured by the 83rd Infantry Division on 15 April. As it was in the occupation zone allocated to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference, the Alsos Mission, led by Boris Pash and accompanied by Lansdale, arrived on 17 April to remove anything of interest. Over the following ten days, 260 truckloads of uranium ore, sodium uranate and ferro-uranium weighing about 1,000 tons were taken away.|$|E
5|$|During 1944 the 4th Armoured Brigade {{provided}} crews for comparative {{trials of}} the American M4 Sherman and British Churchill tank in New Guinea conditions that were conducted by the Australian Army {{in response to a}} request from the British War Office. Macarthur-Onslow proposed including other tanks in these trials, including a British Cromwell that had <b>been</b> <b>shipped</b> to Australia in 1943, but this did not occur. Before the tanks were sent to New Guinea, the 4th Armoured Brigade trialled two Sherman tanks alongside Grants and Matilda IIs in Queensland during mid-1944. The Churchills and Shermans were subsequently trialled in the Madang region of New Guinea; the Churchill proved better suited to jungle conditions.

5|$|Marshall held another {{press conference}} on October 17 to {{announce}} that the NAACP was requesting a formal government investigation into the working conditions that had led the men to strike. He called attention to three aspects: the Navy policy that put {{the great majority of}} African Americans into segregated shore duty, the unsafe munitions handling practices and lack of training that had led to the catastrophic detonationand the unfair manner in which 50 of 258 men had been singled out as mutineers. when their actions concerning loading ammunition after the explosion were not significantly different from the other 208 men. Marshall pointed to the men of Division One who had refused to load ammunition prior to August 9, but had <b>been</b> <b>shipped</b> out and given other duty, not arrested and court-martialled.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the leaders}} of Kentucky's Confederate {{government}} had remained in Chattanooga, Tennessee, awaiting Governor Hawes' return. They finally departed on September 18, and caught up with Bragg and Smith in Lexington, Kentucky on October 2. Bragg had been disappointed {{with the number of}} soldiers volunteering for Confederate service in Kentucky; wagon loads of weapons that had <b>been</b> <b>shipped</b> to the Commonwealth to arm the expected enlistees remained unissued. Desiring to enforce the Confederate Conscription Act to boost recruitment, Bragg decided to install the provisional government in the recently captured state capital of Frankfort.

5|$|The AGM-129 was fielded in 1987 as a {{stealthy}} {{cruise missile}} platform {{to deliver the}} W80-1 variable yield nuclear warhead. Although originally designed to equip the B-1B Lancer bomber, the AGM-129 was redesignated {{so that it would}} only be carried by the B-52H, mounted on external pylons on the wings or internally in the bomb bay. In March 2007, the USAF decided to retire its AGM-129 complement in order to help comply with international arms-control treaties and to replace them with AGM-86 missiles. In order to do so, the USAF began to transport its AGM-129s stored at Minot to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana by B-52s for ultimate disposal. According to The Washington Post, by 29 August 2007, more than 200 AGM-129s had <b>been</b> <b>shipped</b> from Minot to Barksdale in this manner.|$|E

5|$|The Alsos Mission {{had learned}} that the uranium ores that {{had been taken from}} Belgium in 1944 had <b>been</b> <b>shipped</b> to the Wirtschaftliche Forschungsgesellschaft (WiFO) plant in Staßfurt.

As it was in the occupation zone allocated to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference, the Alsos Mission, led by Pash and accompanied by Lansdale, Perrin and Air Commodore Sir Charles Hambro, arrived on 17 April to remove anything of interest. Over the following ten days, 260 truckloads of uranium ore, sodium uranate and ferrouranium weighing about 1,000 tons, were taken away by an African-American truck company. The uranium was taken to Hildesheim and most of it was flown to the United Kingdom by the Royal Air Force; the rest had to be moved to Antwerp by train and loaded onto a ship to England.|$|E
5|$|The {{weather had}} begun to deteriorate, and {{it was decided that}} the schuit was not strong enough to bring the {{remaining}} Malagasy ashore. One end of a rope was anchored to the shore, and at low tide volunteers from the Dutch group on shore swam out to Meermin, bringing {{the other end of the}} rope with them and handing it up to the crew on the ship. The crew then helped the remaining fifty-three Malagasy climb down to the Dutch volunteers, who helped them to shore, some carrying children on their backs. The Dutch built a fire to warm the Malagasy after their immersion in the water, and fed them; three wagons took them to Cape Town on 12March. Of the 140 or so Malagasy who had <b>been</b> <b>shipped,</b> 112 reached the Cape Colony as slaves.|$|E
