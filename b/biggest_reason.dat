25|$|One of the <b>biggest</b> <b>reason</b> for {{increase}} in female infanticide is {{being associated with}} the {{increase in}} number of private Ultrasound Scanning Centres which often tell the sex of baby, and as they become more accessible and affordable people who could not find out the sex of baby historically, have started finding it out and often results in abortion in case of girl child.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in {{free agency}} they signed Tim Thomas away from divisional Phoenix, in a four-year, $24million deal. That was to counter the {{defection}} of Vladimir Radmanović to the Lakers in a similar deal, except Radmanovic signed for an extra year, but both players would make {{the same amount of}} money annually, which would be $6million. Sam Cassell (widely credited as the <b>biggest</b> <b>reason</b> for the Clippers' recent success) signed a two-year, $13million deal. Cassell stated that once he retired he would like to join the Clippers' coaching staff under Mike Dunleavy, Sr. The team also signed veteran Aaron Williams to an undisclosed deal.|$|E

25|$|Zoey (Miles?): A baby {{orangutan}} who {{was brought}} into the Miles' family after being rejected by her mother. Zoey is very playful and curious, which is the <b>biggest</b> <b>reason</b> she gets into tight, and sometimes near fatal, situations. Having an aggravating tendency to rip things apart (mainly Molly's homework), throw food around, and trash anything she comes across, {{she has to be}} carefully monitored {{as if she were a}} human toddler. She once swallowed an entire bottle of shampoo and became seriously dehydrated, which caused Molly to rush her to a hospital in order to keep her from dying. This act has probably led to Zoey bonding strongly with Molly and learning the most from her.|$|E
25|$|Probably the <b>biggest</b> <b>reason</b> {{behind the}} spread of Islam in the region was the very weak {{presence}} of the Church in Bosnia at the time. The old competition between the Catholic and Bosnian churches (along with the Orthodox Church in certain areas) contributed to a very weak and disorganized religious structure in much of Bosnia. To many Bosnians religion {{was a combination of}} traditions and superstitions. Compared to the well-funded and organized religious institutions of their neighbors, it was relatively easy for Bosnians to switch from their folk-Christianity to Islam. It is significant that the only other European region under Ottoman control where {{a large segment of the}} population adopted Islam was Albania; also home to competing Christian sects. Some taxes on Muslims and orthodox Vlachs were also lighter than those on other rayah. The Hatt-ı Şerif attempted to eliminate this uneven taxation.|$|E

500|$|Bruce David Forbes, {{author of}} Religion and Popular Culture in America, {{felt that the}} video drew on Madonna's {{childhood}} experiences and dramatized her efforts to renegotiate these relationships, in her daily interactions with her lover and father, and in relation to Catholicism, which the singer {{referred to in the}} line [...] "Oh father I have sinned". Dunn noticed that like the Pepsi commercial shot for her earlier single [...] "Like a Prayer", Madonna's persona is split into a child and adult, who repeatedly fuse and separate. Leslie C. Dunn commented that as the narrative developed, the child is shown singing, but the adult Madonna's voice is heard, and when the adult Madonna appears in a hallway, her shadow is that of a child. Madonna responded to these observations by saying: [...] "I think the <b>biggest</b> <b>reason</b> I was able to express myself and not be intimidated was not having a mother." ...|$|E

The movie included the songs [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" [...] and [...] "What Kind of Love Are You On" [...] by Aerosmith. In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the <b>biggest</b> <b>reason</b> I changed my mind was because I was scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career – I just want it to be special when I make a movie." ...|$|E

On the other hand, Sterling Whitaker of The Boot put [...] "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] at number six on his list of Top 10 Jason Aldean Songs. Laura McClellan of Taste of Country ranked the song at number three of Aldean's Top 10 songs, citing it as [...] "the <b>biggest</b> <b>reason</b> the industry is beginning to recognize Aldean with award nominations." [...] Chuck Dauphin of Billboard ranked the song atop his list of Jason Aldean's 10 Best Songs and described it as [...] "a ballad that one doesn’t get tired of hearing – and that’s not something you see everyday."

500|$|... "Frozens success doesn't {{benefit from}} a general {{appetite}} for American films in Japan" [...] (as reported by the International Business Times), but according to Akira Lippit of the USC School of Cinematic Arts, there were several factors that constituted this phenomenon: besides the fact that animated films [...] "are held in great regard in Japan, and the Disney brand name {{with all of its}} heritage is extremely valuable", [...] "the <b>biggest</b> <b>reason</b> is the primary audience... 13- to 17-year-old teenage girls." [...] He further explained that audiences of this age range have a vital role in shaping Japanese pop culture and [...] "Frozen has so many elements that appeal to them, with its story of a young girl with power and mystique, who finds her own sort of good in herself." [...] He compared the film's current situation with a similar phenomenon which occurred with Titanic in 1997, [...] "when millions of Japanese teen girls turned out to watch Leonard DiCaprio go under– several times," [...] and thought the same would happen with Frozen. Another reason that contributed to the film's success in the market was that Disney took great care in choosing [...] "high quality" [...] voice actors for the Japanese-dubbed version, since Japan's pop music scene had an important role particularly with teenage audiences. Orika Hiromura, Disney Japan's marketing project leader for Frozen, {{said in an interview with}} The Wall Street Journal: [...] "We really put effort into finding actors who could not only play the role but also belt out the tunes as well. We found the perfect match in Takako Matsu and Sayaka Kanda, and they really added a whole new dimension to the storytelling." ...|$|E

Marshall repeatedly asked her to marry him, but after finding that she had had many affairs while they were together, married film actress Corinne Griffith instead.|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{certainly}} the <b>biggest</b> <b>reason</b> {{for the increase}} in invalid ballots {{was that in the}} vote for the parliament, the ballot papers for the constituency elections were combined with that for the regional lists.

2500|$|In January 2001, the Ohio State University {{dismissed}} Cooper. His {{loss in the}} Outback Bowl to a {{team that}} had not even won a single game the year before {{was a factor in}} his subsequent firing, as was negative publicity regarding player behavior before and during the game. [...] Other contributing factors included the record against Michigan (which was actually considered by most people to be the <b>biggest</b> <b>reason</b> for his firing), a reputation of inability to win [...] "big games", the lack of a national championship, the perception of him as an outsider by many alumni, the poor bowl game record, and finally a perceived lack of discipline on the team.|$|E
2500|$|Hart fought {{his way to}} {{the finals}} of the tournament to crown the next Intercontinental Champion and was set to face Faarooq at [...] Owen beat Faarooq with Austin's help. Afterward, Austin {{explained}} that he wanted to beat Hart for the title when he returned and would not allow Faarooq or anyone else to beat him. After Hart retained the title twice by disqualification between Bad Blood and Survivor Series in Montreal, Austin got his wish and defeated Hart for the Intercontinental Championship again. Later that night, the Montreal Screwjob took place. Bret left the Federation after the event and both the British Bulldog and Jim Neidhart were granted quick releases from their contracts to jump to WCW. This left Owen as the only Hart family member remaining in the WWF, due to his contractual obligations. Unlike Smith and Neidhart, Vince McMahon did not grant Owen a release from his contract and Owen remained with the company. He was skeptical about returning to WCW anyway, as he was not confident that the organization would use him correctly. Bret has said that the <b>biggest</b> <b>reason</b> Owen did not make the move was because WCW president Eric Bischoff was unwilling to match his WWF contract.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his first}} full season in 1984, San Diego won their first NL West title. Gwynn was elected to start in his first All-Star Game, and {{he won his first}} batting title with a [...]351 average along with 71 RBIs, and 33 stolen base; he had only 23 strikeouts in 606 at-bats. He {{finished}} third in the balloting for the National League MVP behind Chicago Cubs winner Ryne Sandberg and runner-up Keith Hernandez of the New York Mets. He had 213 hits, breaking the Padres record of 194 set by Richards in 1980. Gwynn hit second in the Padres batting order behind Alan Wiggins, and benefited from the higher number of fastballs opposing pitchers threw in response to the speedy leadoff hitter (70 SB) being on base. Wiggins' speed also disrupted the defense and opened up holes that Gwynn was able to exploit for hits. He hit above [...]400 when Wiggins was on base ahead of him. [...] "Anybody can hit a fastball", said Gwynn. The duo was one of the <b>biggest</b> <b>reason</b> behind San Diego's success. They could score fast with Wiggins getting on first, stealing second, and Gwynn singling him home. Gwynn batted [...]410 with runners in scoring position, and Manager Dick Williams said his records indicated that Gwynn had the best [...] "RBI percentage" [...] on the team.|$|E
