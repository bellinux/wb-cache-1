Another radiographic sign of elevated lead levels is the presence of radiodense lines called lead lines at the metaphysis in the long bones of growing children, especially around the knees. These lead lines, caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|Chelation challenge, {{also known}} as {{provocation}} testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable <b>body</b> <b>burden</b> of heavy metals including lead.

Chelation challenge mainly measures the burden of lead in soft tissues, though whether it accurately reflects long-term exposure or the amount of lead stored in bone remains controversial. Although the technique {{has been used to}} determine whether chelation therapy is indicated and to diagnose heavy metal exposure, some evidence does not support these uses as blood levels after chelation are not comparable to the reference range typically used to diagnose heavy metal poisoning.

25|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. This is because mercury is stored in the muscle tissues of fish, and when a predatory fish eats another fish, it assumes the entire <b>body</b> <b>burden</b> of mercury in the consumed fish. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. The first occurrence of widespread mercury poisoning in humans occurred this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E

500|$|On June 11, 2007, {{the plaintiffs}} {{presented}} their first argument, {{in which they}} contended that Michelle Cedillo, {{as well as other}} children with autism, suffered from a [...] "mercury efflux disorder" [...] which was described by Aposhian, their first expert witness, as [...] "a problem with getting a metal, in this case mercury, out of a cell." [...] As evidence that such disorders have been documented before, he pointed to Wilson's disease. Aposhian based this claim, in part, on three peer-reviewed papers. The first such study was co-authored by Boyd Haley, and concluded that hair of children with autism contained less mercury than that of children without autism. Aposhian stated that [...] "we know that the hair is an excretory organ and that the hair is reflective of the mercury or the metal in the blood, and the blood {{is a reflection of the}} mercury in the tissues, and so the fact that the children with autism had less mercury in their hair was a hint or indication that perhaps there was mercury efflux disorder." [...] The second of these studies was conducted by James B. Adams, and found that baby teeth of children with autism had more than twice as much mercury as those of children without autism. Aposhian cited this study as evidence that [...] "autistic children have a greater <b>body</b> <b>burden</b> of mercury." [...] Another study which Aposhian used to back up this statement was one conducted by Jeff Bradstreet and Mark Geier, which gave dimercaptosuccinic acid, a chelating agent, to children and concluded that children with autism excreted much more mercury thereafter than children without autism. [...] Aposhian also cited a number of in vitro studies as evidence that thimerosal could cause immune system dysregulation.|$|E
500|$|Jeffrey Brent, {{the past}} {{president}} of the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, was invited to testify about the potential role of thimerosal-containing vaccines in triggering Michelle's autism. He stated that [...] "there was not a single study indicating that any form of mercury could cause serious neurological symptoms in the dosages that were used in vaccines" [...] and criticized Aposhian's use of in vitro studies and his equating them to what happens in the actual animal, arguing that [...] "the exposure to a cell in a petri dish was far more likely to cause damage than an equivalent dosage in a living system." [...] With regard to specific in vitro studies, Brent argued that the Goth study was flawed because it tested thimerosal on mouse cells, not human cells; because these cells were exposed not to ethylmercury, as the human body would be after receiving a thimerosal-containing vaccine since thimerosal is quickly metabolized to ethylmercury, but to thimerosal itself, and because the cells were exposed to far higher concentrations of thimerosal than could ever occur {{as a result of the}} administration of thimerosal-containing vaccines. Brent highlighted similar problems with the Agrawal study, noting that the cells in that study, like those in the Goth study, were exposed to thimerosal, not ethylmercury, and to much higher doses than found in vaccines. He also examined the Bradstreet and Geier study and the Holmes study, noting that [...] "much better studies from other investigators could not replicate the results of either the Holmes study or the Bradstreet/Geier study," [...] citing two other peer-reviewed papers which had concluded that hair mercury levels were not significantly different between study participants with autism and controls, as well as a study which had concluded that children with autism had no chelatable heavy-metal <b>body</b> <b>burden</b> whatsoever. Brent also pointed out that, like another of Bradstreet's studies, the Bradstreet-Geier study had been published in a non-indexed journal, the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, which he described as [...] "very much of a fringe journal with lots of alternative agendas, and it's not even indexed by the National Library of Medicine." [...] Brent concluded by testifying that thimerosal could not have degraded Michelle's immune system to the extent that when she was vaccinated with MMR nine months later, it caused brain damage, saying [...] "That couldn't possibly be the case." [...] In the second set of the proceedings, which pertained to thimerosal alone (as opposed to thimerosal working in conjunction with MMR), Brent testified, with regard to Jordan King and one other child with autism who also served as a test case in this trial, that there was [...] "absolutely no reason to chelate them for any mercury-related reason." ...|$|E

To this end, juvenile oysters purchased from a oyster hatchery were transplanted to a reference site, in Bouin, and to different transplantation sites in the Marennes-Oléron Bay, the first oyster production area in France, and in the Gironde Estuary, the biggest estuary in Occidental Europe. Transplantations were done during summer and winter. Whole oyster soft tissues from each site were analyzed for PAHs, PCBs, PBDEs and OCPs. Results obtained with a transplantation period of 3 months suggest that the C. gigas, at the juvenile stage, is a relevant sentinel organism for short-term contamination for these contaminants. In addition, no significant effects of physiological factors on contaminant <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> were observed. A principal component analysis performed with chemical <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> allowed them to be separated into three groups: 1) the reference site, 2) Les Palles (LP) and Boyard (BOY) in winter and 3) all the other sites.

In addition, no relevant effects of physiological or environmental factors on contaminant <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> were observed. Results suggest also a predominance of contaminants related to agricultural activities along the Marennes-Oléron Bay, and therefore, further studies on the presence of pesticides in this region should be considered...|$|R
40|$|Background: Knowledge of time {{trends in}} burdens {{of the heavy}} metals cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) are {{important}} to evaluate effects of preventive actions. This has previously been monitored in northern Sweden in samples from 1990 - 1999. Alpha- 1 - microglobuline (A 1 M) in urine is a potential biomarker of tubular dysfunction, presumed to be effected by <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> of cadmium. It is unknown if elements from catalytic converters, platinum (Pt), rhodium (Rh) and palladium (Pd), cause human exposure. Objective: To continue the time trend series of <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> of Cd, Pb and Hg and to quantify levels of Pt, Rh and Pd and alpha- 1 -microglobuline in samples from northern Sweden. Design: Biobanked blood samples from health screenings in the WHO MONICA-project in northern Sweden were analyzed for Cd, Pb and Hg, in two age-groups; 25 - 35 years and 50 - 60 years. In 2004, blood samples from 287 women were analysed and in 2009, blood samples from 150 men and 177 women were analyzed. Also, cadmium and A 1 M were analysed in urine for the 2004 and 2009 participants. Pt, Rh and Pd were analysed in blood for 26 women in ages 55 - 59 years from the 2009 screening. Results: There was a decline in blood levels of Pb in both men and women. Blood levels of Cd did not change over time. However, in women, levels of U-Cd were lower in 2009 as compared to 2004, also in never-smokers in the younger age-group. Due to use of erythrocytes in the previous report on data from 1990 - 99, <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> of Hg could not be compared to previous data. A decrease from 2004 to 2009 was detected in B-Hg in women in the older age-group. Levels of Pd could not be quantified due to high uncertainty in the analysis. Blood levels of Pt and Rh were at levels of about one thousandth of the heavy metals. Levels of protein A 1 M in urine could not be compared over time, due to changes in analytical method. Levels of the protein {{were higher in the}} older age-group and men had higher levels than women in samples from 2009. Conclusion: The previously detected decline in <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> of Pb continued from 1999 to 2009, while there is still no evident change in <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> of Cd. We cannot evaluate the time trend of Hg <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> after 1999 with these data. Levels of Pt and Rh are detectable. Surprisingly, men in the older age-group had higher levels than women of protein A 1 M. For Cd, there are indications of risk of adverse health effects at the reported levels.

Intake rates and <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> of TCDD were estimated for adult males over the course of the simulation period and compared to available biomonitoring data. One of the most important factors determining the magnitude of the simulated human exposure to TCDD was the fraction of the chemical deposited directly to soil (where it was assumed to have a degradation half-life of 10 or 15 years) relative to the fraction assumed to remain on/in the forest canopy following the spray application (where it was assumed to have a degradation half-life of ≤ 48 h). The simulated <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> under the various scenarios considered were broadly consistent with the biomonitoring data from SVN collected in the mid- 1980 s to late 1990 s.
