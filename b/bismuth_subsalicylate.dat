40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} microscopic colitis (MC) and a stepwise {{approach to}} its diagnosis and management. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: MEDLINE was searched from January 1996 to August 2002. Controlled trials were sought, {{but due to}} their relative rarity, most articles cited are well designed retrospective studies and reviews. MAIN MESSAGE: Microscopic colitis in both its collagenous and lymphocytic forms is a relatively common and important cause of diarrhea in middle-aged and elderly patients. It usually presents as chronic watery diarrhea. Results of endoscopic and radiologic examinations are normal; specific histologic findings are seen on colonic biopsy. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, we suggest a stepwise approach to therapy. First-line therapies include antidiarrheal agents; second-line include <b>bismuth</b> <b>subsalicylates</b> and budesonide; third-line include cholestyramine and 5 -aminosalicylic acid agents. When patients fail to respond to these therapies, oral corticosteroids or immune modulatory therapy should be considered. For severe unresponsive cases, colectomy is the last resort. CONCLUSION: Microscopic colitis is an important cause of chronic diarrhea. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, a stepwise approach to treatment is suggested...|$|R

40|$|Adipose tissue hormone leptin induces endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation {{mediated}} by nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHF). Previously {{it has been}} demonstrated that in short-term obesity the NO-dependent and the EDHF-dependent components of vascular effect of leptin are impaired and up-regulated, respectively. Herein we examined the mechanism of the EDHF-dependent vasodilatory effect of leptin and tested the hypothesis that alterations of acute vascular effects of leptin in obesity are accounted for by chronic hyperleptinemia. The study was performed in 5 groups of rats: (1) control, (2) treated with exogenous leptin for 1 week to induce hyperleptinemia, (3) obese, fed highly-palatable diet for 4 weeks, (4) obese treated with pegylated superactive rat leptin receptor antagonist (PEG-SRLA) for 1 week, (5) fed standard chow and treated with PEG-SRLA. Acute effect of leptin on isometric tension of mesenteric artery segments was measured ex vivo. Leptin relaxed phenylephrine-preconstricted vascular segments in NO- and EDHF-dependent manner. The NO-dependent component was impaired and the EDHF-dependent component was increased in the leptin-treated and obese groups and in the latter group both these effects were abolished by PEG-SRLA.

5|$|Antimotility {{medication}} has {{a theoretical}} risk of causing complications, and although clinical experience has shown {{this to be}} unlikely, these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever. Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea. Loperamide is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. <b>Bismuth</b> <b>subsalicylate,</b> an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, {{can be used in}} mild to moderate cases, but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{compounds}} {{account for}} about half the production of bismuth. They are used in cosmetics, pigments, and a few pharmaceuticals, notably <b>bismuth</b> <b>subsalicylate,</b> used to treat diarrhea. Bismuth's unusual propensity to expand upon freezing is responsible for some of its uses, such as in casting of printing type. Bismuth has unusually low toxicity for a heavy metal. As the toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent years, there is an increasing use of bismuth alloys (presently {{about a third of}} bismuth production) as a replacement for lead.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{overdose}} can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, {{a single}} large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, {{higher than normal}} doses are taken {{over a period of}} time. Acute overdose has a mortality rate of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children. Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including activated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis. The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30–100mg/l after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300mg/l in people taking high doses and 700–1400mg/l following acute overdose. Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to <b>bismuth</b> <b>subsalicylate,</b> methyl salicylate, and sodium salicylate.|$|E
