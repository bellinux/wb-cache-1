5|$|American {{domestic}} public {{concerns about}} intervening in foreign conflicts persisted {{from the end}} of the Vietnam War. The Reagan administration emphasized the use of quick, low-cost counter-insurgency tactics to intervene in foreign conflicts. In 1983, the Reagan administration intervened in the multisided Lebanese Civil War, invaded Grenada, bombed Libya and backed the Central American Contras, anti-communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua. While Reagan's interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the United States, his <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> the Contra rebels was mired in controversy. The Reagan administration's <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> the military government of Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War, in particular the regime of Efraín Ríos Montt, was also controversial.|$|E

5|$|Three Democratic {{candidates}} {{had announced}} intentions {{to run for}} governor in 1899—Goebel, former Kentucky Attorney General P. Wat Hardin, and former congressman William J. Stone. Hardin, a native of Mercer County, had the <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. Lyon County's Stone had the <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> the state's agricultural interests. Goebel generally had the <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> urban voters. Going into the party's nominating convention, Hardin was the favorite to win the nomination. Knowing that combining forces {{was the only way to}} prevent Hardin's nomination, representatives of Goebel and Stone met on June 19, 1899, to work out a deal. According to Urey Woodson, a Goebel representative at the meeting, the two sides signed an agreement whereby half of the Louisville delegation, which was committed to Goebel, would vote for Stone. Both men agreed that, should one of them be defeated or withdraw from the race, they would encourage their delegates to vote for the other rather than support Hardin.|$|E

5|$|In June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, {{heir to the}} thrones of Austria-Hungary, {{was assassinated}} by pan-Slavic nationalists, leading to a sudden {{deterioration}} in relations between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. Austria-Hungary {{was supported by the}} German Empire, whilst Serbia had the <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> the Russian Empire. On 28 July, Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia, which, in turn, required the mobilisation of Russia, hence of Germany, thanks to its responsibilities under the Dual Alliance.|$|E

5|$|A wealthy {{resident}} of al-Rahba, Ibn Mahkan, revolted against the Fatimids and {{took control of}} the town shortly after Lu'lu departed. Though able to oust the Fatimid governor, Ibn Mahkan was unable to hold the town without outside support since al-Rahba was located amid the crossroads of several regional powers who coveted the town. Thus, he gained the <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> the Mirdasid emir of the Banu Kilab tribe, Salih ibn Mirdas. Conflict arose between Ibn Mahkan and Salih leading the latter to besiege al-Rahba. The two reconciled and then Ibn Mahkan and his men captured the fortified town of Anah in Anbar. However, when Ibn Mahkan sought Salih's support in suppressing a revolt in Anah, the latter used the opportunity to kill Ibn Mahkan.|$|E
5|$|After Fan {{was forced}} to step down from his office, Wang Anshi (1021–1086) became Chancellor of the {{imperial}} court. With the <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> Emperor Shenzong (1067–1085), Wang Anshi severely criticized the educational system and state bureaucracy. Seeking to resolve {{what he saw as}} state corruption and negligence, Wang implemented a series of reforms called the New Policies. These involved land value tax reform, the establishment of several government monopolies, the support of local militias, and the creation of higher standards for the Imperial examination to make it more practical for men skilled in statecraft to pass.|$|E
5|$|Ali {{refused to}} negotiate, gained the <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> Salibi, {{and the two}} {{defeated}} their father, who had since demobilized his troops and was relying on local civilian volunteers from Acre. When Zahir re-mobilized his Maghrebi mercenaries in Acre he launched an offensive and defeated Ali, who subsequently fled Deir Hanna in October. Out of sympathy for Ali's children, who remained in the fortress village, he pardoned Ali on the condition he pay 12,500 piasters and 25 Arabian horses for the fortress. By December 1767, Zahir's intra-family disputes were put to rest for several years (until 1774–75), and through the intercession of Uthman, a close and enduring alliance was established between Zahir and Sheikh Nasif.|$|E

5|$|Auchinleck, now Commander-in-Chief, India, {{strongly}} opposed {{such a move}} preferring to retain the division as an entity. Instead, he proposed that the newly arrived 81st (West Africa) Division {{could be used in}} its place. Despite his arguments {{and the end of the}} division's availability for operations against the Japanese-occupied Ramree Island, he was over-ruled by Churchill's <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> Wingate. On 6September, the division began reorganising for long-range penetration. It had been estimated that 10 percent of the men would be unsuitable but this had been based on an erroneous report given in London (believed to be from Wingate) that the division was not first class, even though the standard of its infantry was high.|$|E
5|$|Curtis, {{with the}} <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, {{rejected}} the Storrow Commission's proposal.

He later {{explained that he was}} giving them an opportunity to reconsider their actions and avoid discharges, which would have been irrevocable. The police union members responded that same day by voting 1134 to 2 in favor of a strike and scheduled it to start at evening roll call the next day. Their stated grounds omitted wages and working conditions. They said the strike's rationale was to protest the Commissioner's denial of their right to ally themselves with the AFL.|$|E

After much political dispute over several proposed variations, excavation work began in 1960 with the energetic <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> Prime Minister Robert Menzies. After the completion of the bridges and dams, the dams were locked in September 1963. However, a drought meant that the target water level was not reached until April 1964.
