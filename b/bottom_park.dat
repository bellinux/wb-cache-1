50|$|Beginning in 1981, the City of Lethbridge {{purchased}} new parkland using {{funds from}} Urban Parks for the Future, a project {{run by the}} provincial government and funded by the Heritage Trust Fund. Such parks include: Pavan Park, Alexander Wilderness Park, Peenaquim Park, Lethbridge Nature Reserve and Elizabeth HallWetlands, Indian Battle Park, Bull Trail Park, Botterill <b>Bottom</b> <b>Park,</b> and Popson Park.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{irregular}} {{in shape}} and comprised 4.5 ha in total. It is bordered by {{the road to the}} North and the soon to be called ‘Lakeshore Drive’ to the East, Hengrove Way to the South and Crox <b>Bottom</b> <b>Park</b> to the West. The current buildings are on a site occupied, until the 1960s, by Crox Bottom farm. The farm stopped its activities in 1962. Crox Bottom is a public open space at the edge of Hartcliffe and Headley Park and has been proposed as a Site of Nature Conservation Interest in the Bristol Local Plan. The Pigeonhouse Stream runs through the site.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{parks in the}} area and plenty of untamed forests to hike around in. Almost every valley and creek in Jonestown is managed by the Lower Colorado River Authority, which means you can hike on it freely as public land. Jones Brother's Park is a huge {{waterfront}} public area on Lake Travis featuring 3 boat ramps, a playground, several Great Texas Oak Trees, a basketball court, a large open field ideal for playing Frisbee or flying a kite, and an array of shaded picnic areas. Pecan <b>Bottom</b> <b>Park</b> was officially turned into a public park after locals constantly maintained a rock damn in Sandy Creek.|$|E

500|$|Upper Pine <b>Bottom</b> State <b>Park</b> is a [...] Pennsylvania {{state park}} in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania in the United States. The park is in Cummings Township on Pennsylvania Route 44 and is {{surrounded}} by the Tiadaghton State Forest. It is on Upper Pine Bottom Run, which gave the park its name and is a tributary of Pine Creek. Upper Pine <b>Bottom</b> State <b>Park</b> is in the Pine Creek Gorge, where the streams have cut through five major rock formations from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, a {{nostalgia for the}} bygone Main Street charm took hold; among other changes, {{municipal}} officials installed some old-fashioned cast iron signposts. A 1990s-2000s wave of park-building and improvement added Bridgeview Park, Wynant Park, Oakdale Community Park, Warm Springs Turnpike Pocket Park, and the Cook's Creek Arboretum. Edgewater Park was remodeled: a troubled [...] "midnight basketball" [...] court was turned into parking and wetlands-landscaping, a water-cascade and fishpond were added, and a (flood-resistant) river-overlook platform was installed. The landscaping changes and tireless bird feeding by {{a small number of}} local enthusiasts has made the site a waterfowl haven. Sandy <b>Bottom</b> <b>Park</b> had been an overgrown scrubland surrounding a sewage system structure and road works garage—buried in a foot of sandy sediment in the Flood of 1985; improvements included removing flood-mounded driftwood and installing a nine-hole community golf course with a fine view of the Bridgewater Air Park (FAA: VBW / ICAO: KVBW) runway approach.|$|E
40|$|Generally, {{statistics}} are based off {{the assumption that}} observations are independent {{from each other in}} space. In larger ecological systems however, there can be spatial autocorrelation whereby data collected in nearby areas are not independent of one another which violates the assumption of most statistical tests. It is therefore becoming commonplace for ecological studies to study spatial autocorrelation to both eliminate error (accounting for a nuisance variable that could give false positives) and to better understand the spatial structure of their system of interest. Indeed, the mechanisms that lead to spatial autocorrelation are often associated with behaviors and/or intrinsic characteristics of our target species or community. In this study we investigated whether nest productivity and nest predation of the Prothonotary Warbler (Prothonotaria Citrea) were spatially autocorrelated at Deep <b>Bottom</b> <b>Park</b> along the lower James River, VA. Nest success and predation were measured at 66 different nest boxes over a period of four years (2009 - 2013). We found no spatial autocorrelation between these nest boxes when analyzing both reproductive success and nest predation events. This indicates that our observations are independent from each other in space, and spatial variables are not driving reproductive success or predation, rather individual bird quality is likely the main driver for these differences.
