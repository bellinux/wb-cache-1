5000|$|A {{relative}} of Flight 601's co-pilot {{said he had}} warned that flights on the airline were routinely overloaded and that a nearby slum attracted birds to the runway. However, Sagar Acharya, the airline's head of flight safety, denied the aircraft was carrying too much weight. Most reports stated that the aircraft suffered a bird strike shortly after taking off from Tribhuvan. Conflicting reports stated that it had struck a black eagle, while others stated that it had hit a vulture. This <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> <b>report</b> was confirmed by the air traffic controller on duty, as the air traffic controller stated that the pilot contacted Tribhuvan's Tower for an intention for emergency landing due to [...] "technical glitches", possibly due to a bird strike. Based on the ATC statements, the right engine of Flight 601 might have {{been hit by a}} bird and caught fire. Investigators later focused on the bird strike theory.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the current study was fourfold: to {{identify}} bird strike reporting trends at Part 139 airports in Indiana (2001 - 2014) for comparison to national data; to determine which quarter of the year yields the most bird strike data; to gain a clearer understanding of the relationship between altitude and bird strikes, and to develop information based upon the data analyzed {{that can be used for}} the safety management of birds including comparisons to national data.   Design/methodology: The researchers in this study answered the research questions by reviewing, sorting, and analyzing existing data.   The data collection took place from March 01 to May 02, 2016. Two data sets were utilized for data collection. The National Wildlife Strike Database (NWSD) and the FAA Air Traffic Activity System (ATADS). Findings: When compared to national data, Indiana Part 139 airports have seen a faster increase in bird strike reporting during 2012 and 2014. Aggregate data indicated June through September (Quarter 3) had a significantly higher frequency of bird strikes reported.   When examining bird strikes and altitude of occurrences, the exponential equation explained 95 % of the variation in number of strikes by 1, 000 -foot intervals from 1000 to 10, 000 feet. Not surprisingly, the risk of bird strikes appears to decrease as altitude increases. Originality/value: This study adds to the body of knowledge by addressing the lack of published <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> <b>report</b> analyses at a regional level.   It also connects data analyses to safety management system (SMS) concepts and Wildlife Hazards Management Programs (WHMP). The aviation community can use regional bird strike data and information to develop or enhance existing wildlife hazard management programs, increase pilot awareness, and offers airport managerial implications...|$|E
40|$|Land-use {{restrictions}} {{in the vicinity}} of airports are increasingly employed as a means to reduce <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> on aircraft. Yet, in the absence of controlled studies, the link between land usage and <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> is largely anecdotal. In seeking a connection between <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> and land use, the records of <b>reported</b> <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> from the years 1990 - 2001 were examined for 28 airports in down-state Illinois. For each airport it was noted whether land use within 6 miles of the airports included large bodies of water or wetlands, wildlife sanctuaries, golf courses, landfills, shopping venues with food concessions, or croplands. Because most <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> reportedly occur in the course of aircraft takeoffs and ascent or aircraft descent and landing, aircraft operations (defined as takeoffs or landings) are taken to represent opportunities for <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> such as might be linked to surrounding land uses. This allows the creation of a comparative statistic for the number of aircraft operations per <b>reported</b> <b>bird</b> <b>strike.</b> Because <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> <b>reports</b> are voluntary, no attempt is made to formulate a predictive statistic. However, it is noted that the largely rural down-state Illinois airports <b>report</b> <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> (as a function of aircraft operations) far less frequently than is indicated by a comparative national statistic. The <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> <b>reporting</b> frequency among the studied down-state Illinois airports is noticeably greater at the more heavily trafficked airports.

In 1965 ICAO began to monitor <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> through the collection of <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> <b>reports</b> as {{it became clear that}} the turbine engined aircraft coming into wider use were more susceptible to <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> damage than their predecessors. This data collection became automated in 1980 with the creation of the ICAO <b>Bird</b> <b>Strike</b> Information System (IBIS), which now contains information on more than 80 000 <b>bird</b> <b>strikes.</b> When IBIS was created, it was thought that approximately 10 000 <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> occurred worldwide each year. However, since 1980, increases in <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> <b>reporting</b> C which have come about through a greater awareness of the problem and the efforts of those in the field of airport wildlife control C have given us a better perspective of the present <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> situation. While estimates vary, it is now believed that as many as 40 000 <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> occur to civil aviation aircraft each year. <b>Bird</b> <b>strikes</b> are truly a worldwide phenomenon, as shown by the fact that more than 190 States and Territories, from every ICAO Region, have <b>reported</b> <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> to ICAO. IBIS data reveals that ninety percent of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes,</b> with known locations, occur on or near airports. Birds are attracted to airports and to the airport vicinity for a variety of reasons, all basic and tied directly to their survival. However, their basic needs put birds in direct conflict with aircraft using airports, and it is inevitable that collisions between aircraft and birds occur. While the vast majority of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> have no effect on the flight, eleven per cent of all <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> do effect the flight in some tangible way. From the point of view of airport operations, aborted take-offs and emergency or precautionary landings are the most serious.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Agriculture’s National Wildlife Research Center, {{through an}} Interagency Agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), {{maintains}} a national database of reports of bird {{and other wildlife}} collisions (strikes) with civil aircraft. Wildlife strikes are an increasing problem that costs civil aviation in the USA over $ 350 million annually and the occasional loss of human lives. The database, with about 28, 000 <b>strike</b> <b>reports</b> for 1990 - 1999, provides critical information to airport operators, biologists, engine manufacturers, aeronautical engineers and regulators in designing programs, policies, and aircraft to reduce damaging wildlife strikes. A major deficiency in the database, however, is that about 50 % of the <b>reported</b> <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> provide no information on the bird species involved. To improve the identification of bird species involved in civil aircraft strikes, the National Wildlife Research Center has entered into {{an agreement with the}} Smithsonian Institution, Division of Birds. Dr. Carla Dove, Marcy Heacker-Skeans and their colleagues, at no cost to the airport or aircraft owner, will identify bird remains that are sent with the <b>strike</b> <b>report</b> (FAA Form 5200 - 7). Remains should be sent in a resealable plastic storage bag attached to Form 5200 - 7 to the address on the form (FAA Office of Airport Safety and Standards, AAS- 310, 800 Independence Ave. SW, Washington, DC 20591). Send whole feathers when possible because diagnostic characteristics are often found in the fluffy part or barbs of the feather base. Beaks, feet, bones and talons also are useful diagnostic material.

Since 1995, approximately 46, 600 <b>reported</b> <b>strikes</b> from 1990 - 2002 involving civil aircraft in the USA or for USA carriers in foreign countries have been entered into the database. About 97 % of the <b>reported</b> <b>strikes</b> have involved <b>birds</b> and 3 % have been with mammals or reptiles. Over 2, 000 <b>reported</b> <b>strikes</b> have indicated substantial damage to the aircraft. The database {{has proven to be}} an extremely useful source of objective information on the extent and nature of wildlife strikes for individual airports and for researchers and engineers conducting national studies. Selected records and fields of the database are now available online at [URL] for use by airport personnel, engine manufacturers, FAA officials and others. Although the database is already a powerful research and management tool, improvements are needed in the reporting procedures to make the database even more useful. First, we estimate that up to 80 % of strikes with civil aircraft were not reported under the current voluntary reporting system. Furthermore, only 19, 324 (43 %) of the 45, 340 <b>reported</b> <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> identified the <b>bird</b> to species group (e. g., gull or hawk) and only 9, 350 (48 %) of these 19, 324 reports further identified the bird to species level (e. g., ring-billed gull [Larus delewarensis]). Thus, only 19 % of the <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> <b>reports</b> identified the <b>bird</b> to species. Identification of species struck is critical for prioritizing bird management activities at airports and for engineering/airworthiness studies of aircraft and engine components. To improve species identification, the Feather Laboratory at the Smithsonian Institution, through an agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration, now provides free identification of <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> remains for civil aircraft in the USA (instructions {{can be found at the}} above website). Improvements are also needed in the reporting of other critical strike variables.

According to {{data collected by}} the US Department of Agriculture, over 80, 000 <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> were <b>reported</b> in the period 1990 to 2007 in the US alone (Ref. 1). As a result, bird ingestion {{is an important factor}} in aero engine design and FAA certification. When it comes to bird impacts on engine fan blades, the FAA requires full-scale bird ingestion tests on an engine running at full speed to pass certification requirements. These rotating tests are complex and very expensive. To reduce development costs associated with new materials for fan blades, it is desirable to develop more cost effective testing procedures than full-scale rotating engine tests for material evaluation. An impact test on a nonrotating single blade that captures most of the salient physics of the rotating test would go a long way towards enabling large numbers of evaluative material screening tests. NASA Glenn Research Center has been working to identify a static blade test procedure that would be effective at reproducing similar results as seen in rotating tests. The current effort compares analytical simulations of a <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> on various non-rotating blades to a <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> simulation on a rotating blade as a baseline case. Several different concepts for simulating the rotating loads on a non-rotating blade were analyzed with little success in duplicating the deformation results seen in the rotating case. The rotating blade behaves as if it were stiffer than the non-rotating blade resulting in less plastic deformation from a given bird impact. The key factor limiting the success of the non-rotating blade simulations is thought to be the effect of gyroscopics. Prior to this effort, it was anticipated the difficulty would be in matching the prestress in the blade due to centrifugal forces Additional work is needed to verify this assertion, and to determine if a static test procedure can simulate the gyroscopic effects in a suitable manner. This paper describes the various non-rotating concepts analyzed, and demonstrates the effect believed to be gyroscopic in nature on the result...|$|R

From 1990 - 2005, 370 (0. 6 %) of the 64, 734 <b>reported</b> <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> to civil aircraft involved helicopters. Of the 370 <b>reported</b> <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> involving helicopters, 186 (50 %) indicated damage and 67 (18 %) indicated substantial damage. In contrast, only 15 % of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> with fixed-wing aircraft resulted in damage and 4 % resulted in substantial damage. Whereas helicopters accounted for only 0. 6 % of all <b>bird</b> <b>strikes,</b> helicopters accounted for 13 % (2) of the 16 aircraft destroyed and 24 % (34) of the 141 injuries caused by <b>bird</b> <b>strikes.</b> For helicopters, 63 % of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> and 77 % of damaging strikes occurred during the en-route phase of flight compared to only 2 % and 7 %, respectively, for fixed-wing aircraft. The much higher en-route strike rate for helicopters is related to the lower height at which helicopters typically fly compared to fixed-wing aircraft. For helicopters, about 52 % of strikes occurred from 501 - 2, 000 feet AGL compared to 14 % for fixed-wing aircraft. This is a height zone frequently used by many bird species, especially gulls, waterfowl, raptors and vultures, the species most commonly struck by helicopters. For helicopters, 97 % of strikes causing damage occurred at an indicated airspeed of more than 60 knots. Windshields represented 41 % of helicopter components reported as damaged by <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> compared to only 6 % for fixed-wing aircraft.

Bomber aircraft had the highest strike rate; these aircraft frequently fly long missions at low altitudes where {{they are likely to}} encounter birds. The analyses indicated that factors contributing to USAF <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> overlap and interact. The study allows recommendations for improving <b>reporting</b> of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> and data management as well as make recommendations for airfield management. Results will enable USAF to better focus research on preventing <b>bird</b> <b>strikes,</b> and assess the effectiveness of bird management programs...|$|R

40|$|Collisions between {{aircraft}} and wildlife have increased markedly since first recorded in 1905. These strikes threaten human safety and cost the United States civil aviation industry 3 ̆e 677 million annually. We examined the Federal Aviation Administration’s national wildlife strike database records from 1990 – 2010 to characterize <b>reported</b> <b>strikes</b> with civil aircraft in Mississippi. We hypothesized that daily foraging patterns and seasonal differences would affect <b>strike</b> frequency for <b>birds.</b> We summarized 381 <b>reported</b> <b>strikes</b> (366 <b>birds,</b> 14 mammals, and 1 reptile) comprising 3 ̆e 42 species. <b>Bird</b> <b>strikes</b> per 1000 aircraft operations (take-off and landing counted as separate operations) increased between 1990 2010. The monthly number of <b>reported</b> <b>strikes</b> per 1000 operations peaked July–September, coinciding with late breeding season and fall migration. <b>Bird</b> <b>strikes</b> per 1000 operations occurred more often during runway approach than during take-off, {{and more often}} at dusk than during other times of day. These patterns mirrored nationally observed wildlife-strike patterns. Our results may aid airport biologists in Mississippi to prioritize species management and more effectively implement timing and types of animal control efforts...|$|R
40|$|Airplane {{accidents}} {{are generally more}} serious than accidents involving other methods of transportation. One cause of airplane accidents is a collision with a bird, which is called a <b>bird</b> <b>strike.</b> Particularly, if the bird is ingested by the jet engine, the airplane may lose power and crash. Therefore, {{it is useful to}} understand the <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> risk before opening a new airport. In this paper, the <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> situation at existing airports in Japan is investigated, and the frequency and factors of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> are presented (including geographic information, the number of takeoffs and landings, land use around the airport, and so on). Also, the relationships between these various factors and <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> occurrence are analyzed. Furthermore, risk analysis is performed using Monte Carlo simulations of Haneda Airport as an example (which is the biggest airport in Japan), and <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> countermeasures are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Human and {{wildlife}} conflicts {{have increased in}} importance in many suburban areas of the United States. Birds pose a serious hazard to air traffic, and 1, 200 - 1, 500 <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> are <b>reported</b> to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) annually. The location of a landfill near an airport may increase avian activity because landfills provide a food source for omnivorous birds. To reduce avian hazards at airports, FAA Order 5200. 5 A established a proximity criterion prohibiting the location of any runway used by turbojet aircraft within 3, 048 m of a landfill. However, existing landfills within this proximity may be kept open if an acceptable bird management strategy is developed and maintained. The objectives {{of this study were}} to: (1) document bird use at Nanticoke Sanitary Landfill; (2) evaluate 3 potential techniques for reducing bird numbers at the landfill; and (3) develop bird management guidelines for the landfill environment. Avian numbers, species, and behavior patterns were monitored at the landfill for 11 months (December 1991 through October 1992) before control activities were initiated. The repellent effects of methyl anthranilate (MA, ReJeXiT®), Posi-shellR (PS) cover material, and pyrotechnics (PT) were evaluated during late October to December 1992. A surface MA application did not reduce avian numbers at the landfill, as birds quicKly learned to tear open plastic refuse bags to obtain untreated food. PS treatment alone did not reduce numbers, as birds were able to forage through the thin surface covering. However, hazing birds with the spray equipment used to apply PS reduced the daily number of gulls (primarily herring gulls, (Larus argentatus) foraging at the landfill by about 50...|$|R

40|$|An {{effective}} {{definition of}} a <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> {{is the basis for}} quantifying the scale of bird hazard problems. Here we present a working {{definition of a}} <b>bird</b> <b>strike,</b> which in turn forms the basis of an analysis of 32 years’ data collected at Dublin Airport, Ireland. A variety of datasets are analysed including the number of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> per ten thousand aircraft movements, the mass of the bird species being struck, the time of year at which <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> occur and the dimensions of the aircraft utilising the airfield. In addition, we have analysed the mean number of strikes per year and the mean number of birds struck per <b>bird</b> <b>strike.</b> Following a very serious incident involving a Boeing 737 - 200 which struck a flock of gulls in the mid - 1980 ’s, a new regime of control measures was put in place. Therefore our study permits us {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} this management programme. The results suggest that the most significant impact of control measures is to reduce the number of birds being struck per <b>bird</b> <b>strike...</b>|$|R
40|$|Within {{seconds after}} liftoff of the Space Shuttle during mission STS- 114, a turkey vulture {{impacted}} the vehicle's external tank. The contact caused no apparent {{damage to the}} Shuttle, but the incident led NASA to consider the potential consequences of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> during a Shuttle launch. The environment at Kennedy Space Center provides unique <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> challenges due to the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge and the Atlantic Flyway bird migration routes. NASA is currently refining risk assessment estimates for the probability of <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> to space launch vehicles. This paper presents an approach for analyzing the risks of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> to space launch vehicles and presents an example. The migration routes, types of birds present, altitudes of those birds, exposed area of the launch vehicle, and its capability to withstand impacts affect the risk due to <b>bird</b> <b>strike.</b> A summary of significant risk contributors is discussed...|$|R
