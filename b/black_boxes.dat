On 28 December 1962, Kennedy lowered the US demand to 8–10 stations. On 19 February 1963, the number was lowered further to seven, as Khrushchev continued to insist on no more than three. Kennedy was willing to reduce the number to six, though this was not clearly communicated to the Soviet Union. On 20 April 1963, Khrushchev withdrew support for three inspections entirely.|$|E

What is a <b>black</b> <b>box</b> group? A <b>black</b> <b>box</b> group X is a device or an algorithm (`oracle' or `black box') which produces (nearly) uniformly distributed independent random elements from some finite group X. These elements are encoded as 0 [...] 1 strings of uniform length; given strings representing x, y # X, the <b>black</b> <b>box</b> can compute strings representing xy and x - 1, and decide whether x = y in time bounded from above by a constant. In this setting, one is usually interested in finding probabilistic algorithms which allow us to determine, with probability of error #, the isomorphism type of X in time O(|#| (log|X|) c). We say in this situation that our algorithm is run in Monte Carlo polynomial time. A critical discussion of this concept can be found in [6], while [7] contains a detailed survey of the subject. See also the forthcoming book by Seress [38]. In this paper we discuss a (still rather rudimentary) structural approach to the theory of <b>black</b> <b>box</b> group. We briefly survey methods for constructing <b>black</b> <b>box</b> oracles for subgroups and factor groups of <b>black</b> <b>box</b> groups, and then show how one can construct <b>black</b> <b>box</b> oracles for centralisers of involutions. They are used in the algorithm for finding the p-core of a <b>black</b> <b>box</b> group of characteristic p...|$|R

25|$|On 26 January 2007, {{a dispute}} arose between Adam Air and the Indonesian {{government}} regarding the retrieval of the <b>black</b> <b>boxes.</b> Due to the depth involved, recovery required an underwater remotely operated vehicle, {{but due to}} the cost of using this method of recovery—especially since such equipment needed to be shipped in from elsewhere—the government placed the responsibility for the cost of recovering the recorders on Adam Air. Vice-President of Indonesia Jusuf Kalla went as far as to question the need to retrieve the <b>black</b> <b>boxes</b> at all, although experts said in response that the accident was of international significance as it could indicate a fault with the aircraft. Adam Air said that in its opinion, the <b>black</b> <b>boxes</b> should be recovered, describing the accident as being relevant on both national and international levels, but refused to pay, saying that was the responsibility of the government. Indonesia did request technical assistance from the United States, Japan and France. Jim Hall, {{a former chairman of the}} US National Transportation Safety Board, said that it was essential the boxes be recovered quickly, as at that point their 30-day battery life was about to expire, which subsequently did happen. He cited problems such as poor visibility and strong currents making it difficult to recover the devices without the signal. Setio Rahardjo, Head of National Committee for Transportation Safety, estimated that equipment for the salvage operation, if available, would cost US$100,000 per day to hire in an operation that would take around ten days, equating to US$1 million.|$|E
