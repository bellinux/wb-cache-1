5|$|The {{discovery}} of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921 is {{considered among the}} most significant events {{in the history of}} medicine. The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>transplantation</b> and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic stem cells. This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells. The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the glycaemic index, the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker. The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T cell receptor, which triggers responses of the immune system. The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis. Among the research conducted at the laboratory was the development of gel electrophoresis.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveExperimental and {{clinical}} {{studies have suggested}} that intramyocardial <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> stem cell <b>transplantation</b> combined with coronary artery bypass grafting might improve left ventricular function in the setting of chronic ischemic heart disease. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of available publications regarding the efficacy and safety of intramyocardial <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> stem cell <b>transplantation</b> during coronary artery bypass grafting. MethodsThe databases PUBMED, MEDLINE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and ClinicalTrials. gov (all from their inception to May 2009) were searched for randomized controlled trials and cohort studies of intramyocardial <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> stem cell <b>transplantation</b> during coronary artery bypass grafting to treat ischemic heart disease. Six studies were included. ResultsCompared with control groups, the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> stem cell <b>transplantation</b> group showed a significant improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction from baseline to follow-up (5. 40 %; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 36 – 9. 44; P = . 009). Moreover, the overall change of left ventricular end-diastolic volume from baseline to follow-up favored the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> stem cell therapy group (9. 55 mL; 95 % confidence interval, − 2. 82 to 21. 92; P = . 13). Major adverse cardiovascular events, including ventricular arrhythmia and the composite of other cardiovascular events, were not significantly different between the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> stem cell therapy group and controls (relative risk for ventricular arrhythmia =  0. 951; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 389 – 2. 325; P = . 913; relative risk for cardiovascular event =  1. 134; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 28 – 4. 6; P = . 86).

40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 2051 - 2056 Motivation: A {{significant}} {{issue in}} stem cell therapy {{is to understand}} the role {{of this type of}} cell in the tissue regeneration. To explain this mechanism, an experimental study has quantified that the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> cell <b>transplantation</b> decreases the number of inflammatory cells and reduces the fibrosis area in chagasic mice. Using this experimental data, we have developed an agent-based computational model to investigate the regeneration of the chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy after <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> stem cell <b>transplantation.</b> Results: Our model includes six different types of agents: inflammatory cell, fibrosis area, cardiomyocyte, proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α, Trypanosoma cruzi parasite and <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> stem cell. This latter promotes apoptosis in inflammatory cells, reduction in the fibrosis area and can differentiate into cardiomyocyte. Proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α can increase the fibrosis area and T. cruzi can increase the number of inflammatory cells.
