40|$|A {{method and}} an {{apparatus}} is provided for efficiently controlling the power output of a {{solar cell array}} string or a plurality of solar cell array strings to achieve a maximum amount of output power from the strings under varying conditions of use. Maximum power output from a solar array string is achieved through control of a pulse width modulated DC/DC buck converter which transfers power from a solar array to a load or <b>battery</b> <b>bus.</b> The input voltage from the solar array to the converter is controlled by a pulse width modulation duty cycle, {{which in turn is}} controlled by a differential signal controller. By periodically adjusting the control voltage up or down by a small amount and comparing the power on the load or bus with that generated at different voltage values a maximum power output voltage may be obtained. The system is totally modular and additional solar array strings may be added to the system simply by adding converter boards to the system and changing some constants in the controller's control routines...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{technique}} for efficiently extracting the maximum output power from a solar panel under varying meteorological conditions is presented. The methodology {{is based on}} connecting a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) dc/dc SEPIC or Cuk converter between a solar panel and a load or <b>battery</b> <b>bus.</b> The converter operates in discontinuous capacitor voltage mode whilst its input current is continuous. By modulating a small-signal sinusoidal perturbation into the duty cycle of the main switch and comparing the maximum variation in the input voltage and the voltage stress of the main switch, the maximum power point (MPP) of the panel can be located. The nominal duty cycle of the main switch in the converter is adjusted to a value, so that the input resistance of the converter {{is equal to the}} equivalent output resistance of the solar panel at the MPP. This approach ensures maximum power transfer under all conditions without using microprocessors for calculation. Detailed mathematical derivations of the MPP tracking technique are included. The tracking capability of the proposed technique has been verified experimentally with a 10 -W solar panel at different insolation (incident solar radiation) levels and under large-signal insolation level changes. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Meeting {{rapidly growing}} global energy demand—without {{producing}} greenhouse gases or further diminishing {{the availability of}} non-renewable resources—requires the development of affordable low-emission renewable energy systems. Here, we develop a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) for automotive applications—specifically, a roof-installed photovoltaic (PV) array combined with a PEM fuel cell/NiCd <b>battery</b> <b>bus</b> currently operating shuttle routes on the University of Delaware campus. The system’s overall operating objectives—meeting the total power demand of the bus and maintaining the desired state of charge (SOC) of the NiCd battery—are achieved with appropriately designed controllers: a logic-based “algebraic controller” and a standard PI controller. The design, implementation, and performance of the hybrid system are demonstrated via simulation of real shuttle runs under various operating conditions. The results show that both control strategies perform equally well in enabling the HRES to meet its objectives under typical operating conditions, and under sudden cloud cover conditions; however, at consistently high bus speeds, battery SOC maintenance is better, and the system consumes less hydrogen, with PI control.

40|$|A new {{control method}} for battery storage to {{maintain}} acceptable voltage profile in autonomous microgrids is proposed in this article. The proposed battery control {{ensures that the}} bus voltages in the microgrid are maintained during disturbances such as load change, loss of micro-sources, or distributed generations hitting power limit. Unlike the conventional storage control based on local measurements, the proposed method {{is based on an}} advanced control technique, where the reference power is determined based on the voltage drop profile at the <b>battery</b> <b>bus.</b> An artificial neural network based controller is used to determine the reference power needed for the battery to hold the microgrid voltage within regulation limits. The pattern of drop in the local bus voltage during power imbalance is used to train the controller off-line. During normal operation, the battery floats with the local bus voltage without any power injection. The battery is charged or discharged during the transients with a high gain feedback loop. Depending on the rate of voltage fall, it is switched to power control mode to inject the reference power determined by the proposed controller. After a defined time period, the battery power injection is reduced to zero using slow reverse-droop characteristics, ensuring a slow rate of increase in power demand from the other distributed generations. The proposed control method is simulated for various operating conditions in a microgrid with both inertial and converter interfaced sources. The proposed battery control provides a quick load pick up and smooth load sharing with the other micro-sources in a disturbance. With various disturbances, maximum voltage drop over 8 % with conventional energy storage is reduced within 2. 5 % with the proposed control method...|$|E

(TMI), {{teamed with}} the Ohio Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, has engineered, constructed, and {{demonstrated}} a stationary, low power, multi-module solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) prototype system operating on propane and natural gas. Under Phase I, TMI successfully operated two systems in parallel, {{in conjunction with}} a single DC-AC inverter and <b>battery</b> <b>bus,</b> and produced net AC electricity. Phase II testing expanded to include alternative and renewable fuels typically available in rural regions of Ohio. The commercial system is expected to have ultra-low pollution, high efficiency, and low noise. The TMI SOFC uses a solid ceramic electrolyte operating at high temperature (800 - 1000 C) which electrochemically converts gaseous fuels (hydrogen or mixed gases) and oxygen into electricity. The TMI system design oxidizes fuel primarily via electrochemical reactions and uses no burners (which pollute and consume fuel) [...] resulting in extremely clean exhaust. The use of proprietary sulfur tolerant materials developed by TMI allows system operation without additional fuel pre-processing or sulfur removal. Further, the combination of high operating temperatures and solid state operation increases the potential for higher reliability and efficiencies compared to other types of fuel cells. Applications for the TMI SOFC system cover a wide range of transportation, building, industrial, and military market sectors. A generic technology, fuel cells have the potential to be embodied into multiple products specific to Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) program areas including: Fuel Cells and Microturbines, School Buildings, Transportation, and Bioenergy. This program focused on low power stationary applications using a multi-module system operating on a range of common fuels. By producing clean electricity more efficiently (thus using less fuel), fuel cells have the triple effect of cleaning up the environment, reducing the amount of fuel consumed and, for energy intensive manufacturers, boosting their profits (by reducing energy expenses). Compared to conventional power generation technologies such as internal combustion engines, gas turbines, and coal plants, fuel cells are extremely clean and more efficient, particularly at smaller scales...|$|E
