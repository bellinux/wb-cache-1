50|$|The {{most common}} injury made by ladder climbers is {{bruising}} from falling off a ladder, but bone fractures are common and head injuries are also likely, {{depending on the}} nature of the accident. Ladders can slip backwards owing to faulty <b>base</b> <b>pads</b> which usually fit into the ladder stiles. If badly worn, they can allow the aluminium to contact the ground rather than plastic or rubber, and so lower the friction with the ground. Ladder stabilizers are available that increase the ladder's grip on the ground. One of the first ladder stabilizers or ladder feet was offered in 1936 and today they are standard equipment on most large ladders.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Microcantilevers are {{the basic}} and {{fundamental}} MEMS based structures used in microsystems. Microcantilevers have been used both as sensors and actuators. In this paper, modeling and simulation details of a microcantilever for thermal actuation are presented. The advantage of this actuator is, the tip of this actuator which actually drives some other object doesn’t gets heated and hence {{can be used in}} any environment safely. The main objective of this work is to investigate the nature of deflection of microcantilever based actuator for the applied potential difference across the <b>base</b> <b>pads.</b> In this device, two microcantilevers of different dimensions are considered and when these are subjected to same current, deflect differently. The current density in the thin arm is greater than the current density in the thick arm. Therefore, the thin arm heats up more than the thick arm, which makes the thin arm to bend. Thus, temperature produces thermal strain and thermally induced deflections. This turns the microstructure into a thermal actuator. The amount of tip deflection is a direct function of the applied potential difference between the electrical connection pads. Therefore, the amount of tip deflection can be calibrated as a function of applied voltage. Additional objectives of this work are to obtain voltage, temperature and displacement plots. Increasing the applied voltage in the model developed in ANSYS/Multiphysics, resulted in increase in the deflection. This is because of direct relationship between the applied voltage, current density, temperature developed and deflection.

Different contact geometries, i. e. cylinder-on-flat and flat-on-flat, and different contact span width's with different pad's compression forces are analysed. It is found that fretting fatigue life for two <b>based</b> cylindrical <b>pads</b> is shorter than that for two <b>based</b> flat <b>pads</b> and in two <b>based</b> flat <b>pads</b> is shorter than that for perfectly flat pads. In the case of two <b>based</b> flat <b>pads,</b> stress distribution in the pad with width of 3. 1 mm is about 14 % higher than that in the pad with the width of 6. 2 mm and about 21 % higher than that in the pad with the width of 9. 3 mm.

Stresses increased by 21 % for pad force of 1800 N and around 40 % for pad force 2400 N compared with 1200 N pad force.

To attune the transmitted vibration, a typical isolation system was installed without a significant amount of analysis, and consisted of unrestrained pump <b>base</b> mount <b>pads</b> and flexible couplings on the suction and discharge pipes. Initial testing shows that while the <b>base</b> mount <b>pads</b> worked well, the lack of a positive seismic restraint made those devices unsuitable for use in an earthquake zone. The flexible couplings however actually increased vibration transmitted into the piping because of excessive stiffness. Based on the initial test results and site observations, a new isolation system was required. Although isolation theory is relatively simple, this paper describes how a detailed three-dimensional analytical treatment was required to properly determine the properties of the isolators, including the influence of adequate seismic restraints. Test results are included showing the redesigned system effectively isolates the pumps...|$|R
