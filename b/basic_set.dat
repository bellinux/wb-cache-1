5|$|In early 1977, TSR {{created the}} first element of a two-pronged {{strategy}} that would divide D for nearly two decades. A Dungeons & Dragons <b>Basic</b> <b>Set</b> boxed edition was introduced that cleaned up {{the presentation of the}} essential rules, made the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores. Later in 1977, the first part of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD) was published, which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the <b>Basic</b> <b>Set</b> directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the metric}} system {{has changed and}} {{developed}} since its inception, its basic concepts have hardly changed. Designed for transnational use, it consisted of a <b>basic</b> <b>set</b> of units of measurement, now known as base units. Derived units were built up from the base units using logical rather than empirical relationships while multiples and submultiples of both base and derived units were decimal-based and identified by a standard set of prefixes.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{evidence}} for common descent {{has come from}} the study of biochemical similarities between organisms. For example, all living cells use the same <b>basic</b> <b>set</b> of nucleotides and amino acids. The development of molecular genetics has revealed the record of evolution left in organisms' genomes: dating when species diverged through the molecular clock produced by mutations. For example, these DNA sequence comparisons have revealed that humans and chimpanzees share 98% of their genomes and analysing the few areas where they differ helps shed light on when the common ancestor of these species existed.|$|E
5|$|The Dungeons & Dragons <b>Basic</b> <b>Set,</b> {{released}} in 1977, was an introductory {{version of the}} original D geared towards new players and edited by J. Eric Holmes. But in the same year, TSR Hobbies released a completely new and complex version of D, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD). The Monster Manual, released later that year, became the first supplemental rule book of the new system, and many more followed. The AD rules were not fully compatible {{with those of the}} D <b>Basic</b> <b>Set</b> and as a result, D and AD became distinct product lines. Splitting the game lines created a further rift between Gygax and Arneson; although Arneson received a 10% royalty on sales of all D products, Gygax refused to pay him royalties on AD books, claiming it was a new and different property. In 1979, Arneson filed a lawsuit against TSR; it was eventually settled in March 1981 with the agreement that Arneson would receive a 2.5% royalty on all AD products, giving him a very comfortable six-figure annual income for the next decade.|$|E

The original version of the U.S. Millionaires set cost $200,000 to construct. The U.S. Millionaires production design is handled by George Allison, whose predecessors have included David Weller and Jim Fenhagen.|$|E
5|$|Various {{changes have}} been made to the <b>basic</b> <b>set</b> since the {{syndicated}} version's premiere in 1983. In 1996, a large video display was added center stage, which was then upgraded in 2003 as the show began the transition into high-definition broadcasting. In the mid-1990s, the show began a long-standing tradition of nearly every week coming with its own unique theme. As a result, in addition to its generic design, the set also uses many alternate designs, which are unique to specific weekly sets of themed programs. The most recent set design was conceived by production designer Renee Hoss-Johnson, with later modifications by Jody Vaclav. Previous set designers included Ed Flesh and Dick Stiles.|$|E
