Capital expenditure year 2003 had positive correlation with maintenance expenditure of 2004 in and outside Java island, which means the local staff was able to predict the budget of maintenance expenditure for fixed asset obtained in the current year and before. But, for the <b>budgetary</b> <b>year</b> 2004, there was no correlation between capital expenditure and maintenance expenditure, which means, when local staff made the policy about the allocation of capital expenditure budgets, they did not follow it with the budget allocation for maintenance expenditure.

40|$|Objective: The {{research}} {{describes an}} extensible method of evaluating and cancelling electronic journals during a budget shortfall and evaluates implications for interlibrary loan (ILL) and user satisfaction. Methods: We calculated cost per use for cancellable electronic journal subscriptions (n= 533) from the 2013 calendar {{year and the}} first half of 2014, cancelling titles with cost per use greater than $ 20 and less than 100 yearly uses. For remaining titles, we issued an online survey asking respondents to rank the importance of journals to their work. Finally, we gathered ILL requests and COUNTER JR 2 turnaway reports for calendar year 2015. Results: Three hundred fifty-four respondents completed the survey. Because of the level of heterogeneity of titles in the survey as well as respondents’ backgrounds, most titles were reported to be never used. We developed criteria based on average response across journals to determine which to cancel. Based on this methodology, we cancelled eight journals. Examination of ILL data revealed that none of the cancelled titles were requested with any frequency. Free-text responses indicated, however, that many value free ILL as a suitable substitute for immediate full-text access to biomedical journal literature. Conclusions: Soliciting user feedback through an electronic survey can assist collections librarians to make electronic journal cancellation decisions during slim <b>budgetary</b> <b>years.</b> This methodology can be adapted and improved upon at other health sciences libraries...|$|R

40|$|This {{collection}} of studies analyses {{the various ways}} and means that the financial system of the European Union has at its disposal for handling the inevitable uncertainties {{of the future and}} traces their evolution since the creation of the general budget of the European Communities in 1968. Special attention is paid to the consequences of this evolution not only for the various actors involved – namely the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and Member States – but also for the financial system of the European Union as a whole. The question of the uncertainty of the future is addressed {{in the light of the}} theory of “Budgetary Flexibility”, which posits an essential distinction between “External Flexibility and “Internal Flexibility, on the one hand, and “Annual Flexibility“ and “Multiannual Flexibility“ on the other. External Flexibility differs from Internal Flexibility in that, in the case of the former, more resources (or fewer, in the case of budget cuts) can be allocated in the course of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>year.</b> In the case of the latter, budget limits (frames) are maintained, i. e. a reallocation of resources during the financial year will not lead to the growth in the overall size of the budget. At the same time, Multiannual Flexibility differs from Annual Flexibility in that the former can be considered as an exception to the principle of budgetary annuality as set out by the EC and EU Treaties. The theory of “Budgetary Flexibility” allows to place under a common theoretical framework processes that are often considered separate (and treated in the academic literature as such), and also enables to analyse the pros and cons and the consequences of such flexibility, and to draw conclusions at the level of the European Union. The studies also develop further the theory, devised originally in the 1990 s to analyse the budgetary systems of the Member States. The studies focus on three recent major negotiations which led to the Financial Regulation of 25 June 2002, to its first modification, adopted on 13 December 2006, and to the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management and to the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2007 - 2013. The main forms of flexibility identified in the studies are: the system of amending budgets, the quantity of various budget headings and ”operational” budget lines in the general budget and the system of transfer of appropriations during the <b>budgetary</b> <b>year</b> (”structural flexibility”), the system of compulsory vs non-compulsory expenditure (”normative flexibility”), the system of provisional appropriations, reserves and Funds, the system of commitment appropriations, the system of carry-overs, and the various flexibility elements present in budgetary discipline system and the multiannual financial perspectives and framework of the European Union...|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} {{focussed}} {{on the role}} played by bonds in financing development projects of local self-government units. It shows that the local self-government faces a necessity of satisfying inhabitants’ needs in the field of providing services of a public character having limited financial possibilities. The standard and quality of provided services depend, among other things, on the state of technical and social infrastructure. Maintaining it at the same level and all the more so expanding the infrastructure, scope and quality of these services call for substantial financial outlays. The period of implementing them usually surpasses the <b>budgetary</b> <b>year</b> and, hence, the necessity of designing carefully plans and budgets of investments, as well as sources and assessing possibilities of financing them. It {{should be noted that the}} Public Finance Act permits local self-government entities - along with a budget for a given year - to enact long-term investment programmes, which should be compatible with the development strategy assumptions and constitute an element linking current management with strategic goals. A basic function of these programmes is to create favourable conditions for the local authority to plan and finance needs in the field of development in an orderly manner. Consequently, one of the most important issues is fixing priorities in development needs, as well as financial capabilities of the local self-management. Thus, it becomes indispensable to assess the size of long-term investment outlays, which can be afforded by a given local self-government entity. Zadanie pt.

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the importance of}} time in history of fi nancial law {{as well as in}} creation and application of norms of financial law. In the history of public finance theory and financial law time is only a measure of political, social and economic events that affect appearing, modifi cations and disappearing of specific financial institutions. Time is of crucial importance for financial planning. Financial plans are generally included in the annual plans. This results from using the concept of so–called financial year (<b>budgetary</b> <b>year,</b> fiscal year) for drafting, execution and control of execution of the financial plans. However, the modern financial economy requires a longer time horizon (so–called long–term planning), that is already applied by most of developed countries and European Union. There are completely different aspects of time to consider when one discusses issues of generating of public revenues and public expenditures. The assessment of levy liability and of payments of public expenditures has to be determined by time frame. Otherwise, it could be possible neither to determine their extent nor to attribute to them any legal consequences like for example limitation of assessment or enforcement or sanctions (fines, interest for late payment) that are applied in cases of violation of legally binding deadlines. Time also affects factors responsible for the obligation’s existence (for example the obligated or entitled person’s age, period of conducting of economic or professional activities, or period of benefi ting from tax privileges). On the other hand, a variety of time limits apply to fi nancial proceedings. At last, time plays very important role in the determination of various forms of liability under financial law, particularly because of the application of fi nancial sanctions, differentiated based on economic and legal criteria. Therefore, the main conclusion is that time must be determined in financial law precisely, in the manner that leaves no room for any doubt as to whether the norm regulating financial law rights and obligations is binding or not. Therefore, time cannot be presumed. kpgp@uwb. edu. plUniwersytet w Białymstoku, Wydział Praw...|$|E

Unfortunately the PPP-projects in Estonia is such a new topic that there have been no scientifically qualifiying publications written about it. Quite many topic-related articles have been published in journalism but the purpose of them has been mainly political. In Estonia (mainly in Tallinn) the PPP-projects have been exercised since year 2000. Since then the PPP-projects have been debated over by the state (Ministry of Finance) and the City of Tallinn about whether the PPPprojects should be counted into the debt obligations of the city or not? According to the Rural Municipality and City Budget Act a rural municipality or city may take loans, on the following conditions, the total amount of unrepaid loans shall not exceed 60 percent 20 per cent of proposed budget revenue for that <b>budgetary</b> <b>year.</b> Until 2008 Tallinn counted the costs of the PPP-projects only as yearly payments to the private sector but not as a loan. Since 2009 the new bookkeeping rules were enacted and the PPP-projects were counted upon the local government dept obligations. Thereat it is relevant to mention that the methodics of the Eurostat don`t calculate PPP-projects as dept obligations of the public sector. Until now the PPPprojects in Estonia have been exercised only for some years and it has been done only for renovation of the social infrastructure objects (schools) or construction (dwelling houses, sport structures). Although the PPP-projects have been planned to be used in development of the technical infrastructures (roads) these plans haven`t been accomplished yet. PPP-projects have been Tallinn-centered and the reason for this is that Tallinn has compared to other cities a lot more potential to administer and finance the complicated projects.

Hungary witnesses a full-scale transformation of the financing of its system of higher education, and therefore the management is required to monitor the changes of the environment continuously, and modify its objectives accordingly. A gradually emerging need is that these educational units have to frame operating structures that are suitable for flexibly following the changes occurring in their environment. This is a terrain where the management is supported by management control system, which is in fact means of regulating operations and driving preparations for decision-making. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine to what extent the actual financial management data of the University of Debrecen coincide with the plans for the given <b>budgetary</b> <b>year.</b> The empiric research relies on the received reports, and embraces the years of 2008 – 2012; in this manner, a comprehensive view can be formulated in relation to the efficiency of planning in the past 5 years. To ascertain the correctness of operative management, mathematical, statistical and calculation methods are used. The study is conducted in view of the three major questions defined by the methodology of management control system; realistic grounds of the planned data, deviation analysis, identification of causes. The plan fulfilment indicator is used to present the efficiency of planning both on the institutional and the key budgeting levels. In the context of deviation analysis – supervision of the implementation of planned figures –, figures are prepared for better demonstrability. For the detailed identification of the underlying causes, structure analyses are performed for the income and expenditure sides alike. With respect to expenditures, it is examined whether there is any correlation between remunerations, tangible and other current expenses, because they are the two largest budgetary groups of expenditures, while the work of the personnel indeed necessitates the availability of tangible assets. My analysis has concluded that the obtained results confirm the University does not perform its planning operations appropriately. At the time of planning, historic experience and the available information are neglected. The completed analysis directs attention to the importance of the management control system, and the fact that by today this tool for the support of decision-making has become indispensable even for budgetary organisations...|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has helped millions of families purchase homes through its single-family mortgage insurance programs. In recent years, FHA has experienced {{a dramatic increase in}} its market role due to the contraction of other mortgage market segments. FHA insures almost all of its single-family mortgages under its Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (Fund), which is reviewed from both an actuarial and <b>budgetary</b> perspective each <b>year.</b> On the basis of an independent actuarial review, FHA reported in November 2009 that the Fund was not meeting statutory capital reserve requirements as of the end of fiscal year 2009, as measured by the Fund's estimated capital ratio (i. e., economic value divided by the unamortized insurance-in-force). Additionally, although the Fund historically has produced budgetary receipts for the federal government, a weakening in the performance of FHA-insured loans has heightened the possibility that FHA will require additional funds to help cover its costs on insurance issued to date. In light of FHA's changing market role and financial condition, Congress asked us to examine (1) how estimates of the Fund's capital ratio have changed since 2001, the primary factors contributing to recent changes, and the budgetary implications of changes in the Fund's financial performance; (2) how FHA and its actuarial review contractor evaluate the financial condition of the Fund, including the Fund's performance under different economic scenarios; (3) the steps FHA has taken to improve the financial condition of the Fund, and how it has interpreted statutory requirements pertaining to the Fund; and (4) the performance of FHA's mortgage portfolio from 2005 through 2009, {{and the extent to which}} key characteristics of FHA-insured mortgages have changed in recent years. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{assesses the}} {{heterogeneity}} of an enlarged European Union and discusses the role and contribution of CEECs {{on the development of}} this heterogeneity over time. The two central research questions are: What are the factors that distinguish between successful and less successful CEE countries in terms of the EU enlargement? How was heterogeneity in the EU developed in the last decade? Using cluster analysis methods allow the focusing on heterogeneity in the five selected dimensions of interest: Institutions and Governance; Single Market and Openness; Macroeconomic Policies; Symmetry and Convergence; and Competitiveness. We can find that the specific macroeconomic policies followed by CEE countries during the transformation period were less decisive for a successful transition than the level of (non-elite) political stability, the quality of institutional framework, the maturity and compatibility of informal institutions and the initial level of economic development. We also can find substantial convergence in terms of economic indicators in the EU in the period considered but none or a very slow convergence in terms of institutional indicators. The negative consequences of such heterogeneity were strengthened by the crisis. As a consequence the tensions caused by these different speeds of convergence in different fields challenge the long-term sustainability of EMU, and the consequences of this situation should be more intensively discussed in the EU. We also argue that the experience of transition of CEE countries holds valuable lessons for the currently discussed reforms of the southern periphery of Europe. Similarly to the CEECs before their entrance to the EU, the periphery countries need to find a direction to head for in the next 10 - 15 <b>years.</b> <b>Budgetary</b> savings are inevitable; nevertheless positive long-term visions should be formulated as well...|$|R
