Through the macroscopic analysis, chemical components analysis, microstructure analysis and SEM analysis, we drew some conclusions.

Lowering hydraulic losses in the Mutnovskoe field has been realized with the replacement of U-shaped compensators (expansion unit) on the bellows (a U-shaped compensator has a resistance coefficient eight times that of a <b>bellows</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>joint),</b> flattening of pipelines (to reduce the overall length of pipelines and exclude local resistance at turning of flow), dismantling non-functional valves, etc. Lowering the hydraulic losses in Pauzhetskoe field was also realized with the improvement of transportation conditions to the separator, change of separators type, and redistribution of the flow rate among the main steam pipelines.|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} {{particle}} colliders {{begins in the}} early 60 's when an idea previously patented by R. Wideroe in 1953 is constructed. The design of the vacuum chamber in their experimental area became essential {{as it was the}} rst physical barrier that the particles to be detected needed to traverse. The interaction of the products of the collisions with the vacuum chamber structural materials, hindered the identification of the significative events. This Thesis analyses the historical evolution of the experimental vacuum chambers and summarizes the technical criteria that are to be fulfilled. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) presently under construction at CERN is the last generation of particle colliders. Four big experiments will be in operation (ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb) in the LHC with diferent physics objectives. In particular, LHCb will be devoted to the study of CP violation and the design of its vacuum chamber is the scope of this Thesis. Physics simulations with an initial design consisting of a conical aluminium vacuum chamber with stainless steel flanges and bellows expansion joints, foresaw redundancies in the experiment detection channels that would make it inefficient. The reduction of the radiation background generated after the interactions of the products of the proton collisions with the vacuum chamber materials became essential. Berillium became the ideal candidate as structural material for the vacuum chamber due to its excellent mechanical properties and high transparency to radiation. Nonetheless, its toxicity, difficult machining and complicated weld hampers its use. TIG welding of beryllium to beryllium and to aluminium AA 2219 was qualified for UHV applications as per ISO Norms applicable for aluminium welding. On the other hand, beryllium high price led to consider beryllium-aluminium composites for the fabrication of the LHCb vacuum chamber. The mechanical characterization of the berylliumaluminium HIP AlBeMet AM 162 at the required bakeout temperatures of 200 °C and 250 °C was completed. In turn, the electron beam welding of beryllium-aluminium to beryllium-aluminium and to aluminium AA 2219 was qualified for UHV applications following ISO Norms applicable for aluminium welding. Once characterized mechanically the materials and demonstrated the feasibility of the welding, nite element analysis were performed to design the vacuum chamber; as well as to design other special components integrated in it. The fabrication and thorough tests conducted with prototypes is described; in particular, an aluminium AA 6061 OD 860 mm window 2 mm thick that UHV seals one of the detectors, two <b>bellows</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>joint</b> aluminium fabricated in AA 2219 and two optimized aluminium AA 2219 UHV anges. The final design consisting of a TIG welded conical structure 12 m long fabricated in berillium with thickness ranging between 1 and 2. 4 mm, implementing the validated aluminium window, optimized flanges and bellows expansion joints, will allow a factor 5 reduction of the radiation background generated by the initial vacuum chamber allowing the study of the physics that the LHCb experiment is designed for...|$|E

The effects of convolution geometry and boundary conditions on the failure of bellows are analysed in this study. Lateral deflection is considered as a boundary condition and a FEMsolution for bellows is obtained. The stress distribution {{and the number of}} cycles to failure in the conditions of lateral deflection are obtained.

40|$|The 300 -series {{stainless}} steels are metastable austenitic alloys: martensitic transformation occurs at low temperatures and/or when plastic strain fields {{develop in the}} structures. The transformation influences the mechanical properties of the material. The present note aims at proposing a set of constitutive equations describing the plastic strain induced martensitic transformation in the {{stainless steels}} at cryogenic temperatures. The constitutive modelling shall create {{a bridge between the}} material sciences and the structural analysis. For the structures developing and accumulating plastic deformations at sub-zero temperatures, it is of primary importance to be able to predict the intensity of martensitic transformation and its effect on the material properties. In particular, the constitutive model has been applied to predict the behaviour of the components of the LHC interconnections, the so-called <b>bellows</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> (the LHC mechanical compensation system) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{quest for}} high {{particle}} energies of modern superconducting lepton and hadron storage rings assumes a strong {{minimisation of the}} non-magnetic interconnection zones {{when compared to the}} total magnetic length of the main quadrupoles and the dipoles. The ratio of non-magnetic to magnetic zones in the LHC is close to 3 %. Such a low percentage leads to a very compact design of systems and sub-systems situated in the interconnections, like the mechanical compensation system, composed of the <b>bellows</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>joints,</b> that have to compensate for the thermal contraction of the magnets. Given the complexity of the LHC interconnections, the requirements concerning their reliability were considerably increased since the availability of the collider for physics cannot be compromised. The failure modes taken into account in the present analysis are grouped into 3 categories: material failures, structural stability failures and fatigue failures. Optimisation of stainless steel for cryogenic applications has been carried out. Also, a concept of reliability oriented parametric optimisation of the LHC interconnections is presented...|$|R
40|$|To achieve {{maximum beam}} {{energy in the}} LHC the {{accumulated}} length of the interconnections between LHC main magnets has been limited to around 3 % of the total magnetic length in the Arcs and Dispersion Suppressors. Such a low ratio leads to a very compact design of components located in the LHC interconnections. This implies development and evolution of high intensity plastic strain fields in the stainless steel <b>expansion</b> <b>bellows</b> subjected to thermo-mechanical loads at low temperatures. These components have been optimised to ensure high reliability standards required for the LHC. Nevertheless, initial damage can occur and lead to a premature fatigue failure. For structures in which plasticity {{is not confined to}} the crack tip region, standard failure mechanics, based classically on the stress intensity factor or the strain energy density release rate, can not be used. In the present paper, a constitutive model taking into account plastic strain induced g->a' phase transformation and orthotropic ductile damage is presented. This local approach is used to predict the impact of initial imperfections on the fatigue life of thin-walled LHC <b>bellows</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{majority}} of the thin-walled components subjected to intensive plastic straining at cryogenic temperatures are made of stainless steels. The examples of such components {{can be found in}} the interconnections of particle accelerators, containing the superconducting magnets, where the thermal contraction is absorbed by thin-walled, axisymetric shells called <b>bellows</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>joints.</b> The stainless steels show three main phenomena induced by plastic strains at cryogenic temperatures: serrated (discontinuous) yielding, gamma->alpha' phase transformation and anisotropic ductile damage. In the present paper, a coupled constitutive model of gamma->alpha' phase transformation and orthotropic ductile damage is presented. A kinetic law of phase transformation, and a kinetic law of evolution of orthotropic damage are presented. The model is extended to anisotropic plasticity comprising a constant anisotropy (texture effect), which can be classically taken into account by the Hill yield surface, and plastic strain induced anisotropy. For such a model the shape of the yield surface in the stress space varies as a function of the plastic strains. The constitutive model creates a bridge between material science (experiments) and structural analysis. It has been used to predict the response of beam vacuum and cryogenic bellows to monotonic and cyclic loads developed in the interconnections of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN...|$|R
40|$|The Fe-Cr-Ni {{stainless}} steels {{are well known}} for their ductile behaviour at cryogenic temperatures. This implies development and evolution of plastic strain fields in the stainless steel components subjected to thermo-mechanical loads at low temperatures. The evolution of plastic strain fields is usually associated with two phenomena: ductile damage and strain induced martensitic transformation. Ductile damage is described by the kinetic law of damage evolution. Here, the assumption of isotropic distribution of damage (microcracks and microvoids) in the Representative Volume Element (RVE) is made. Formation of the plastic strain induced martensite (irreversible process) leads {{to the presence of}} quasi-rigid inclusions of martensite in the austenitic matrix. The amount of martensite platelets in the RVE depends on the intensity of the plastic strain fields and on the temperature. The evolution of the volume fraction of martensite is governed by a kinetic law based on the accumulated plastic strain. Both of these irreversible phenomena, associated with the dissipation of plastic power, are included into the constitutive model of {{stainless steels}} at cryogenic temperatures. The model is tested on the thin-walled corrugated shells (known as <b>bellows</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>joints)</b> used in the interconnections of the Large Hadron Collider, the new proton storage ring being constructed at present at CERN...|$|R
40|$|The present {{paper is}} focused on {{constitutive}} modelling and identification of parameters of the relevant model of plastic strain- induced martensitic transformation in austenitic stainless steels at low temperatures. The model {{used to describe the}} FCCrightward arrow BCC phase transformation in austenitic stainless steels {{is based on the assumption}} of linearization of the most intensive part of the transformation curve. The kinetics of phase transformation is described by three parameters: transformation threshold (p/sub xi/), slope (A) and saturation level (xi/sub L/). It is assumed that the phase transformation is driven by the accumulated plastic strain p. In addition, the intensity of plastic deformation is strongly coupled to the phase transformation via the description of mixed kinematic /isotropic linear plastic hardening based on the Mori-Tanaka homogenization. The theory of small strains is applied. Small strain fields, corresponding to phase transformation, are decomposed into the volumic and the shear parts. The grade AISI 316 L, stainless steel often used in cryogenic applications, has been chosen as a good example of the austenitic structure. The magnetic permeability of fine gauge stainless steel sheets (thickness 0. 15 - 0. 25 mm) subjected to monotonic straining was measured as a function of strain. The detailed methodology of relevant measurements is presented in the paper. Tuning of the constitutive model is described and the relevant parameters are identified.
