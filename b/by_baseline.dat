40|$|This paper investigates <b>baseline</b> <b>by</b> {{treatment}} {{interactions of}} a randomized anabolic steroid prevention program delivered {{to high school}} football players. <b>Baseline</b> <b>by</b> treatment interactions occur when a participant’s score on an outcome variable is determined both by their pretreatment standing on the outcome variable and the treatment itself. The program was delivered to 31 high school football teams (Control= 16, Treatment= 15) in Oregon and Washington {{over the course of}} three years (Total N= 3207). Regression and multilevel analyses showed consistent <b>baseline</b> <b>by</b> treatment interactions for knowledge of the effects of steroid use and intentions to use steroids.
