50|$|There {{are several}} {{variants}} of the process, using various media; some are highly abrasive, whereas others are milder. The most abrasive are shot <b>blasting</b> (<b>with</b> metal shot) and sandblasting (with sand). Moderately abrasive variants include glass bead <b>blasting</b> (<b>with</b> glass beads) and media <b>blasting</b> <b>with</b> ground-up plastic stock or walnut shells and corncobs. A mild version is sodablasting (with baking soda). In addition, there are alternatives that are barely abrasive or nonabrasive, such as ice blasting and dry-ice blasting.|$|R

40|$|The {{surface quality}} of an implant {{is defined by}} its {{chemical}} and physical properties and its topographical characteristics. The aim of the present thesis was to verify, whether the application of bioceramics (GB 14 /AP 40) as grit leads to an amelioration of the MBC in comparison <b>with</b> a conventional <b>blasting</b> of titanium implants with corundum (Korox). An untreated titanium implant was used as reference. The determined mean values for roughness resulted in 0, 35 &# 956;m for untreated implants, 0, 56 &# 956;m for implants treated with bioceramics and 1, 04 &# 956;m for those treated with corundum. An energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) showed that the particles were impacted into the titanium surface during the blasting. The so pre-treated implants were implanted into the slipping patella of chinchillas. Samples were extracted, fixed, embedded, cut and colored after 7, 28 and 84 days for examination. The morphometrical evaluation under the microscope lead to the result that no specimen had formed an implant-bone-contact (MBC) after 7 days. After 28 days the mending and the bone growth had begun. Of the untreated specimen 3 of 5 cases showed implant-bone contact while MBC was found in 4 of 5 cases treated with corundum or bioceramics. Generally the MBC was below 10 %. After 84 days all cases displayed MBC. Of the untreated specimens 3 of 4 had an MBC below 11 %. In contrast to this result the specimen <b>blasted</b> <b>with</b> corundum showed an MBC between 31 % to 65 % and the ones <b>blasted</b> <b>with</b> bioceramics ranged between 53 % and 77 %. Consequently the use of bioceramics seems to first have a delayed but then, at a later stage, an increased bone growth {{in comparison with the}} application of corundum. After a period of 28 days the untreated specimens as well as the ones <b>blasted</b> <b>with</b> bioceramics showed no compound strength. Of the specimens <b>blasted</b> <b>with</b> corundum 2 of 5 displayed compound strength. After 84 days the untreated samples still exhibited no tensile strength. A certain tensile strength was found in 4 of 5 cases treated with bioceramics and in all cases treated with corundum. The samples <b>blasted</b> <b>with</b> corundum had an average tensile strength 2. 5 times higher than the ones <b>blasted</b> <b>with</b> bioceramics (GB 14 /AP 40). Further studies will have to assess the influence of surface roughness and structure on the long-run behaviour of implants...|$|R
