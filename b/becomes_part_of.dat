50|$|In Czechoslovakia, {{the county}} {{continued}} to exist as the Hont county (Hontianska župa). In 1923, it <b>became</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Zvolen county. In 1928, it <b>became</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the newly created Slovak Land (Slovenská krajina/zem). Following {{the provisions of the}} First Vienna Award, the southern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Czechoslovak Hont <b>became</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Hungary again in November 1938. The remaining northern <b>part</b> <b>became</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the newly created Hron county (1940-1945) of Slovakia. After World War II, the Trianon borders were restored.

5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster has cheek pouches, {{which are}} an {{extension}} of the mouth, extending from the mouth {{all the way to the}} rear legs. Food is transferred into these pouches through the diastema. The inside of the pouch contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae. When the pouch is full, it extends and <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the structure of the skin. By 11 days of age, the cheek pouches are fully grown and can carry objects up to the size of a sunflower seed. When the cheek pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{the tree}} grows thicker and taller as {{successive}} rings develop around its trunk and new buds grow on the branches. The tree <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> an old growth forest with a shaded and damp understory of broadleaf trees, shrubs, and ferns. In the canopy, a mat of dead needles and lichen accumulate {{on the wide}} upper branches. Exposed to light, air, and rain, the needles decompose and the mat becomes colonized by insects, fungus, and new plants.|$|E
5|$|The short channel splits into Newmill Channel and Reading Sewer {{a little}} further to the north, the first flowing southwards, and the second {{originally}} flowing northwards, when it was the main channel for the River Rother. A public footpath follows the eastern bank of Potman's Heath Channel, and continues along the north {{bank of the river}} to Blackwall Bridge, where it <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Sussex Border Path, a long-distance footpath that follows the county boundary.|$|E

5|$|As it {{continues}} through the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, SR 133 follows a four-lane alignment {{on the west}} side of the canyon, moved from the old two-lane road in the center of the canyon in late 2006. Laguna Canyon Road splits to the northwest where the canyon ends in Irvine. North of the park, the highway becomes the Laguna Freeway after crossing an at-grade intersection with Laguna Canyon Road, followed by an interchange at exit 8, San Diego Freeway (I-405). SR 133 then continues as a freeway and serves Barranca Parkway and the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5). After crossing I-5, SR 133 <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Eastern Toll Road along the northwest side of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, crossing an interchange with Irvine Boulevard at exit 12 before ending at SR 241.|$|E
5|$|At a wye in the Porter {{hamlet of}} Blairville, NY18 breaks from its northsouth {{alignment}} {{and turns to}} the northeast before curving northward once more, returning to a perfect northsouth alignment at an intersection with NY93 in the hamlet of Towers Corners. Southwest of the Four Mile Creek State Park, NY18 turns a full 90 degrees {{to the east and}} begins to parallel the southern shore of Lake Ontario. Here, NY18 meets the northern terminus of NY18F, changes names from Creek Road to Lake Road, and <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Seaway Trail, a National Scenic Byway. The route proceeds northeast to Four Mile Creek State Park, where it intersects the northern end of the Robert Moses State Parkway. East of the park, NY18 gradually moves to the north, decreasing the area between the route and the lakeshore as it proceeds east.|$|E
5|$|Chief of Section D Ros Myers (Hermione Norris) {{introduces}} Lucas North (Richard Armitage) {{to one of}} Adam Carter's assets, Pakistani {{intelligence officer}} Marlin (Emilio Doorgasingh). Marlin has information about a planned attack by Al-Qaeda; a cell intends to create Internet chatter, followed by a dry run, after which they will commence a series of suicide attacks. The ringleader behind this is Nadif Abdelrashid (Ariyon Bakare) who was previously responsible for similar attacks in Turkey and Somalia. Ben Kaplan is in his first undercover operation disguised as a recent convert to Islam and <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the cell. As part of his cover, Ben shares a flat with Jawad (Tariq Jordan), another member. However, {{over the course of}} the operation Ben becomes close to Jawad, which Ben's handler Lucas advises against, as Jawad is not an innocent.|$|E

50|$|Waarder was a {{separate}} municipality until 1964, when it <b>became</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Driebruggen, which <b>became</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Reeuwijk in 1989.|$|R
5|$|Farrell was {{inspired}} to try acting when Henry Thomas' performance in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial moved him to tears. With his brother's encouragement, he attended the Gaiety School of Acting, dropping out when he was cast as Danny Byrne on Ballykissangel, a BBC drama about a young English priest who <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> an Irish rural community. As an 18-year-old travelling in Sydney, he was at one time suspected for attempted murder. The police sketch looked remarkably like him and he had even described blacking out during the night in question. His only alibi was apparently a journal kept by his friend that explained the two had been across town that night, taking MDMA.|$|E
5|$|In Mahoning County, {{the route}} <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the eastern city limits of Canfield, meeting US 224 at a parclo interchange. The highway crosses over the Ohio Turnpike, and becomes {{concurrent}} with I-80 few miles later. Here, {{most of the}} route is surrounded by urban areas. The interchange with I-80 and I-680 is incomplete, with ramps from I-680 west to I-80 east and I-80 west to I-680 east missing. I-80 and SR 11 travel northeast, leaves Mahoning County, and enters Trumbull County. SR 11 and I-80 split at the interchange at SR 711, east of Girard.

5|$|The {{entirety}} of SR357 exists {{within the confines}} of South Bass Island in Lake Erie. It is located within Put-in-Bay Township in Ottawa County. In 2012, between 490 and 590 vehicles travel on the road on average each day. SR 357 begins at West Shore Boulevard, and travels southwestward. The route passes by Oak Point State Park, and <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Bayview Avenue. SR 357 then intersects County Route 163, which leads to the Put-in-Bay Airport, and the Put-in-Bay–Catawba Island ferry. The route later leaves Put-in-Bay, near Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial. SR 357 turns northeast to Columbus Avenue, and later ends at a dead end near the lake, next to a driveway.|$|E
50|$|Duklja (Zeta) <b>became</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Raska (Serbia) {{around the}} 1180s. Banjani <b>became</b> a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Raska (therefore Nemanjic state) and, {{less than two}} centuries later, <b>became</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Bosnia, which fell to the Turks in 1466.|$|R

5|$|The game {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} about a seaside town which was damaged by a cataclysm and consequently {{sunk into the}} depths of the earth. A town named Rogueport was later built at this site, with the fortunes of the lost kingdom fabled to exist behind the eponymous Thousand-Year Door, located in the ruins of the old town. Mario becomes involved when Princess Peach contacts him about a treasure map that she bought in Rogueport, but <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a larger adventure after learning that Peach has gone missing. With the help of Goombella and Professor Frankly, Mario learns that the map can potentially reveal the location of the 7 legendary Crystal Stars, which are required to unlock the Thousand-Year Door. Under the assumption that Peach herself is trying to find the Crystal Stars, he uses the map in an attempt to locate her.|$|E
5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.|$|E
5|$|Even more remarkably, {{there is}} a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics, which is {{analogous}} to the laws of thermodynamics. For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the Penrose process). There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy. This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for black hole area to decrease—as long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy increases. As thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit thermal radiation. Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in Planck's law. This radiation is known as Hawking radiation (cf. the quantum theory section, below).|$|E
50|$|Nieuwpoort was a {{separate}} municipality until 1986, when it <b>became</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Liesveld. Last one has <b>become</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Molenwaard in 2013.|$|R

5|$|Once {{the river}} reaches the {{outskirts}} of Hull, its course {{is marked by a}} series of bridges, most of which open to allow boats to pass. There are swing bridges, lift bridges and bascule bridges, and the river <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Port of Hull. The river, which is the dividing line between West and East Hull, bisects the city's industrial area. The bridges can cause traffic delays during high tides, though river traffic is less than it once was. The Beverley and Barmston Drain rejoins the river above Scott Street Bridge. Below North Bridge, an unused dry dock on the west bank marks the former entrance to Queens Dock. Below Drypool Bridge, a muddy basin on the east bank was once the entrance to Drypool Basin and Victoria Dock. The river reaches its confluence with the Humber estuary in the centre of Kingston upon Hull. At its mouth, a tidal barrier has been constructed to prevent tidal surges from entering the river. In the past, these had regularly flooded the town and the flat countryside to the north.|$|E
5|$|While being {{examined}} {{to increase his}} ninja rank, Naruto meets the legendary ninja Jiraiya and learns how to summon toads to aid him in battle, and to control part of the Nine Tails's chakra energy. The exams are interrupted by the invasion of Konohagakure by the criminal Orochimaru and the ninja of Sunagakure. Naruto defeats the sand village's One Tail Jinchuriki Gaara and convinces him {{there is a better}} way to live. Shortly afterward, Naruto discovers the Akatsuki, a criminal organization that seeks to extract the Nine-Tails from his body. Though Jiraiya drives them off during this first meeting, learning its member Itachi is both Sasuke's brother, and the man who killed their family, the Akatsuki still plan to kidnap Naruto. While accompanying Jiraiya to find a new village leader, Naruto also learns the Rasengan, a sphere of chakra for offensive purposes. When Sasuke leaves the village to join Orochimaru's forces to obtain the power to kill Itachi, Naruto <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a rescue team to retrieve him. Naruto and Sasuke ultimately have a one-on-one battle, though neither can bring himself to finish off the other. The two go their separate ways, but Naruto does not give up on Sasuke, leaving Konoha with Jiraiya to prepare himself for his next encounter with Sasuke and the Akatsuki.|$|E
