Cantrell stated, [...] "There are two things {{you never want to}} get into a conversation or argument about: politics and religion.

[...] "No one in the band claims to be an expert on religion, but the title of the song [...] comes from something {{that a lot of people}} actually believe in". Cantrell also stated that he’s sick of the hypocrisy that’s taken over many facets of organized religion. [...] "I think there’s overwhelming evidence that things aren’t working right now. We need to start growing up as a people. When you’re teaching people that being gay is a mortal sin, yet a good portion of the people teaching this are fucking kids, there’s a huge problem".|$|E

It's going to be amazing. It think it first got leaked four years ago or so that the movie was going to be made, and ever since then it's just been stalling and stalling. So I'm really ready for this to happen. But I’m not kidding: It's very imminent." ...|$|E

Karoui was fined 2,400 dinars for the broadcast, while the station's programming director {{and the president of}} the women's organization which provided dubbing for the film were fined 1,200 dinars.
