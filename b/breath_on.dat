5|$|While {{vacationing in}} Vail, Colorado, Ford was hospitalized {{for two days}} in July 2006 for {{shortness}} of <b>breath.</b> <b>On</b> August 15 he was admitted to St. Mary's Hospital of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for testing and evaluation. On August 21, {{it was reported that}} he had been fitted with a pacemaker. On August 25, he underwent an angioplasty procedure at the Mayo Clinic. On August 28, Ford was released from the hospital and returned with his wife Betty to their California home. On October 13, he was scheduled to attend the dedication of a building of his namesake, the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, but due to poor health and on the advice of his doctors he did not attend. The previous day, Ford had entered the Eisenhower Medical Center for undisclosed tests; he was released on October 16. By November 2006, he was confined to a bed in his study.|$|E

50|$|In contrast, partial liquid {{ventilation}} (PLV) is {{a technique}} in which a PFC is instilled into the lung to a volume approximating functional residual capacity (approximately 40% of total lung capacity). Conventional mechanical ventilation delivers tidal volume <b>breaths</b> <b>on</b> top of it. This mode of liquid ventilation currently seems technologically more feasible than total liquid ventilation, because PLV could utilise technology currently in place in many neonatal intensive-care units (NICU) worldwide.|$|R

500|$|... "Last Gasp" [...] {{received}} a fairly negative critical response; in retrospect, Shearsmith claimed that [...] "people hated" [...] the episode. Several critics, including Gerard Gilbert of The Independent, Jack Seale of Radio Times and comedy critic Bruce Dessau—though complimentary of Inside No. 9 generally—considered [...] "Last Gasp" [...] to be weaker {{than the previous}} three episodes, but not unwatchable. Other reviewers gave a more positive response, but a particularly scathing review by columnist Virginia Blackburn {{was published in the}} Daily Express. On its first showing, [...] "Last Gasp" [...] drew 872,000 viewers, lower than any previous episode. Pemberton subsequently sold a balloon containing his own <b>breath</b> <b>on</b> eBay, with proceeds going to a Sport Relief charity.|$|E

500|$|Despite the song's {{commercial}} performance, critical {{reactions to}} the song were mixed to positive. Jon O'Brien of Allmusic, {{in a review of}} Megalomania, viewed [...] "Playmate to Jesus" [...] as one of the highlight songs of the album saying, [...] "The sweeping strings, inspired sound effects, and driving country-pop melodies of the lushly produced opener 'Playmate to Jesus', [...] shows the reunion hasn't been completely without merit." [...] Time said the song [...] "has the dubious distinction of sounding vaguely like a Lady Gaga track that didn’t pass quality control," [...] but was [...] "relatively catchy, boasting the kind of musical infectiousness that causes you to hum it under your <b>breath</b> <b>on</b> the subway." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Melinda Newman of HitFix {{said it was}} [...] "a bit snoozy", however complemented Twain's reasonably strong vocals. Newman added, [...] "She’s not pushing or belting in any way, but she’s upfront and center. However, her delivery is hardly the peppy rallying call that the lyrics call for and if a song ever demanded to be uptempo, this would be it." [...] Sean Daly of the St. Petersburg Times called the song [...] "a shocking stinkeroo every which way." [...] Daly criticized Twain's vocal delivery, noting she sounded as though she sang through {{the side of her}} mouth much like James Cagney, and said the track reinforced the skeptics who insisted Lange was the reason for Twain's success. He concluded, [...] "If 'Today Is Your Day' is a sign of things to come, you might want to hold your <b>breath</b> <b>on</b> that comeback." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV was disappointed with [...] "Today Is Your Day", but said she would [...] "take it" [...] following the singer's long absence from music. Rubenstein commented that the song was undoubtedly saccharine, yet Twain's lush and rich voice prevailed.|$|E
500|$|... "Antes de las Seis" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic highlighted {{it as an}} example of Shakira's versatility and commented that the album [...] "catches its <b>breath</b> <b>on</b> the ballad." [...] Mikael Wood from Entertainment Weekly termed the song a [...] "gorgeous ballad" [...] and encouraged readers to download it. Jesus Yanez-Reyes from Northern Arizona News gave [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] a very positive review and praised its lyrics and Shakira's [...] "heartfelt" [...] vocal delivery as having the ability [...] "to overcome whatever language barriers may exist between the artist and the listener, truly making it a song of note within the release." [...] Jennifer Schaffer from the Stanford Daily complimented the sensitivity of the song and commented that [...] "Shakira offers her listeners a far more vulnerable persona" [...] through it. Carlos Macias from Terra Music picked [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] as his favourite track from the album and commended its lyrics, calling them [...] "classic Shakira" [...] and concluding that [...] "It'd been a while since the Colombian superstar offered us an insight into her heart." [...] At the Premios Nuestra Tierra awards ceremony in 2012, [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] was nominated for [...] "Mejor Interpretación Pop Del Año" [...] ("Best Pop Performance of the Year").|$|E

2500|$|In older patients, {{emotional}} instability {{may be less}} evident, {{or depression}} may occur, and the symptoms and signs are manifestly circulatory.
