5|$|As {{they move}} <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> Hogwarts, Lupin {{turns into a}} {{werewolf}} and becomes violent, having missed a dose of his Wolfsbane potion. Pettigrew escapes again, and Black prevents Lupin from attacking the others in werewolf form. Some Dementors approach Harry, Ron and Hermione.|$|E
5|$|In {{the predawn}} hours of July 29, the 7th Cavalry Regiment withdrew from No Gun Ri. That afternoon, North Korean {{soldiers}} arrived outside the tunnels and helped those still alive, about two dozen, mostly children, feeding them and sending them <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> their villages.|$|E
5|$|Bligh reached England in April 1790, whereupon the Admiralty {{despatched}} HMS Pandora {{to apprehend}} the mutineers. Fourteen were captured in Tahiti and imprisoned on board Pandora, which then searched without success for Christian's party that had hidden on Pitcairn Island. After turning <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> England, Pandora ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef, {{with the loss of}} 31 crew and 4 prisoners from Bounty. The 10 surviving detainees reached England in June 1792 and were court martialled; 4 were acquitted, 3 were pardoned, and 3 were hanged.|$|E
60|$|The girls both tittered, {{and turned}} from {{talking in a}} low tone with their <b>backs</b> <b>toward</b> their elders, and faced them.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he let the}} boy slip to the floor, {{from whence}} he arose slowly and <b>backed</b> <b>toward</b> the door, scowling and muttering angrily.|$|R
60|$|Betsy {{laughed and}} pulled the {{watering}} pot off from Hank's head. The little mule was angry at the treatment he had received and <b>backed</b> <b>toward</b> the Gardener threateningly.|$|R
5|$|Geyser activity, {{like all}} hot spring activity, {{is caused by}} surface water {{gradually}} seeping down through the ground until it meets rock heated by magma. The geothermally heated water then rises <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> the surface by convection through porous and fractured rocks. Geysers differ from non-eruptive hot springs in their subterranean structure; many consist of a small vent at the surface connected {{to one or more}} narrow tubes that lead to underground reservoirs of water and pressure tight rock.|$|E
5|$|The hijackers {{stormed the}} aircraft's cockpit {{approximately}} 46 minutes after takeoff. The pilot and first officer took measures, such as de-activating the autopilot, to hinder the hijackers. However, Ziad Jarrah, who had {{trained as a}} pilot, {{took control of the}} aircraft and diverted it <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> the east coast, in the direction of Washington, D.C. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al-Shibh have claimed that the intended target was the Capitol Building.|$|E
5|$|At {{the road}} bridge, German {{forces of the}} 9th SS had quickly {{surrounded}} Frost's battalion, cutting them {{off from the rest}} of the division. At around 09:00, the 9th SS Reconnaissance Battalion headed <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> Arnhem from south of the river, having concluded that it was not needed at Nijmegen. Though aware of the British troops at the bridge, it attempted to cross by force. In the resultant two-hour battle, it was beaten back with heavy losses; half of its armored vehicles were destroyed or knocked out and its commanding officer, Viktor Gräbner, was killed in action during the assault. German attacks carried on around the British perimeter at the Arnhem bridge for the rest of the day, but the British continued to hold.|$|E
60|$|We withdrew {{behind an}} {{adjacent}} boulder {{to watch the}} actions of the little party, which stood huddled at the foot of another huge rock, their <b>backs</b> <b>toward</b> us.|$|R

50|$|The {{stricken}} ship <b>backed</b> <b>toward</b> Kerama Retto, counting 14 men killed, 8 missing, and 9 wounded. She repaired at Okinawa, {{and arrived}} back at Pearl Harbor on 22 August via Saipan.|$|R
5|$|In {{conference with}} the local Potawatomi, Black Hawk learned of Stillman's {{presence}} and sent three emissaries to the militia camp under a flag of parley in order to negotiate a peace with the soldiers. The already suspicious soldiers took the three emissaries to their camp, and during the proceedings the militia became aware of several of Black Hawk's scouts in the surrounding hills, watching the proceedings. Once the scouts were spotted, soldiers shot at the three emissaries, killing one. The other two fled <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> their camp, located near {{the confluence of the}} Rock and Kishwaukee rivers.|$|E
5|$|Initially Gazan made rapid progress, but {{he quickly}} {{recognized}} that the opposing force was much stronger than the typical rearguard of a retreating army. Realizing he had been duped and that Gazan's troops were tiring rapidly, Mortier sent orders to Dupont's division to hurry forward. By mid-morning the French momentum had stalled; Mortier committed most of his remaining forces to driving Miloradovich back, leaving a single battalion—perhaps 300troops—to cover his northern flank, and sent the rest to attack the Russian right. Within 30minutes he achieved the superiority of numbers he sought. His 4,500French opposed 2,600Russians and forced them <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> Stein while pressing an attack along the river. Miloradovich had no option, for neither Strik's nor Dokhtorov's flanking columns were to be seen.|$|E
5|$|Morgan placed marksmen at {{strategic}} positions, {{who then}} picked off virtually every {{officer in the}} advance company. Morgan and his men then charged, unaware that they were headed directly for Burgoyne's main army. While they succeeded in driving back the advance company, Fraser's leading edge arrived {{just in time to}} attack Morgan's left, scattering his men back into the woods. James Wilkinson, who had ridden forward to observe the fire, returned to the American camp for reinforcements. As the British company fell <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> the main column, the leading edge of that column opened fire, killing a number of their own men.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{how is it}} you're come {{so early}} this cold morning, Maggie? Did you come in the gig?" [...] said Tom, as she <b>backed</b> <b>toward</b> the sofa, and drew him to her side.|$|R

60|$|His astonishment and uneasiness {{increased}} when the squad with their escort, having {{arrived at the}} Drive, were stationed in line facing the river, with their <b>backs</b> <b>toward</b> Seventy-Sixth Street, the Sixty-Ninth Regiment Band a short distance behind them.|$|R
5|$|NY421 {{begins at}} a dead end south of the hamlet of Horseshoe in an {{isolated}} part {{of the town of}} Piercefield. Here, the highway connects to a pair of dirt roads, one of which leads north alongside Horseshoe Lake to Horseshoe. The two-lane route heads eastward from the trails, following the southern shore of Horseshoe Lake while traversing the deep woods of Adirondack Park. At the southeastern end of the lake, NY421 turns northeastward, crossing a small stream feeding into the lake before curving <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> the east. For the next , the road passes through unabated wilderness as it heads toward the western shoreline of Tupper Lake.|$|E
5|$|North of Ann Arbor, {{the freeway}} runs through {{woodlands}} and near several lakes. In {{the community of}} Whitmore Lake, US23 crosses into Livingston County near the city's namesake body of water. East of Brighton, the freeway intersects I-96 and continues north to an intersection with M-59 south of Hartland. The highway turns northeasterly by Runyon Lake and runs toward the city of Fenton. The trunkline passes through town and bends <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> the northwest, running between lakes Ponemah and Fenton. Continuing north, the environment around US23 transitions to rural farm fields as the freeway approaches {{the south side of}} the Flint area.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play of the drive, Tennessee {{committed}} a five-yard false start penalty, pushing the Volunteers <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> their goal line. A Tennessee rush was stopped for no gain, then Stewart picked up eight yards on a running play. Needing eight yards for a first down, Manning threw an 11-yard pass to Kent for the first down. On the next play, Manning completed a 43-yard toss to Kent, driving the Volunteers into the Virginia Tech half of the field. Manning's next throw was a 35-yard touchdown throw to Marcus Nash. The extra point was good, and Tennessee took a 140 lead with 1:08 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
60|$|Isaac's {{hand was}} still extended. This {{time he had}} lowered the muzzle of his pistol. The {{inspector}} was only human and he paused, for he was looking straight {{into the mouth of}} it. Isaac slowly <b>backed</b> <b>toward</b> the door.|$|R
60|$|Instead of {{replying}} to this speech, Ralph <b>backed</b> <b>toward</b> {{the rear}} of the clothing establishment. He had no desire to enter into a fight on the premises. Now he had his clothing, he wished to get out as quickly as possible.|$|R
60|$|Almost {{immediately}} a {{force of}} yellow warriors {{appeared in the doorway}} through which the messenger had come. They were <b>backing</b> <b>toward</b> the apartment, stubbornly resisting the advance of a handful of red men who faced them and forced them slowly but inevitably back.|$|R
5|$|The 2/5 and the Whaling Group {{encountered}} {{very little}} resistance and reached and occupied several ridges south of Point Cruz by early afternoon. Along the coast near Point Cruz, however, the 7th Company from Tamura's battalion fiercely resisted the U.S. advance. In {{several hours of}} fighting, Company C, 1/5 suffered heavy casualties, including the loss of three officers, and was driven <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> the Matanikau by Tamura's troops. Assisted by another company from 1/5 and later by two companies from the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (3/5), plus determined resistance by Marine Corporal Anthony Casamento, among others, the Americans were successful in stopping the retreat.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{concentrated}} their riposte {{against the}} central column. Herff—who {{had been prepared}} to fall back—instead launched a local counter-attack toward Fort Capuzzo during the afternoon of 15 May with the 2nd Battalion Panzer Regiment5. At around 13:30, DCompany 1DLI at the landing ground was overrun, and with no anti-tank support more capable than the Boys anti-tank rifle, the remaining troops of 1DLI were forced to fall <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> Musaid. A fortuitous dust cloud aided their withdrawal, but by 14:45 Panzer Regiment5 was reporting that it had recaptured Capuzzo, inflicting heavy casualties on the British and taking 70 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|An unusually severe Mediterranean {{tropical}} cyclone developed on 23September 1969 southeast of Malta, producing severe flooding. Steep pressure and temperature gradients above the Atlas mountain range were evident on 19September, {{a result of}} cool sea air attempting to penetrate inland; south of the mountains, a lee depression—a low-pressure area in a mountainous region—developed. Under the influence of mountainous terrain, the low initially meandered northeastward. Following the entry of cool sea air, however, it recurved to the southeast before transitioning into a Saharan depression associated with a distinct cold front by 22September. Along the front's path, desert air moved northward while cold air drifted in the opposite direction, and in northern Libya, warm arid air clashed with the cooler levant of the Mediterranean. The organization of the disturbance improved slightly further before emerging into the Mediterranean Sea on 23September, upon which the system experienced immediate cyclogenesis, rapidly intensifying while southeast of Malta as a cold-core cut-off low, and acquiring tropical characteristics. In western Africa, meanwhile, several disturbances converged toward Mauritania and Algeria, while the medicane recurved southwestward <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> the coast, losing its closed circulation and later dissipating.|$|E
60|$|During this {{conversation}} they had sat down together, with their <b>backs</b> <b>toward</b> the door, {{by the side}} of one of the card-tables. While D'Arbino was speaking, Fabio suddenly felt himself shuddering again, and became conscious of a sound of low breathing behind him.|$|R
60|$|Jane Clayton and the Mosula woman {{were sitting}} {{at the opening of}} the former's tent, their <b>backs</b> <b>toward</b> the {{approaching}} ruffians. The first intimation that either had of the presence of strangers in camp was the sudden appearance of a half-dozen ragged villains about them.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, thank you, sir I can't {{stand that}} sort of thing. I'll race you round the piazza with pleasure, Cousin, but his oven {{is too much for}} me," [...] was Mac's uncivil reply as he <b>backed</b> <b>toward</b> the open window, as if glad of an excuse to escape.|$|R
5|$|As {{temperatures}} {{continue to}} rise, the last animal {{life will be}} driven <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> the poles, and possibly underground. They would become primarily active during the polar night, aestivating during the polar day due to the intense heat. Much of the surface would become a barren desert and life would primarily {{be found in the}} oceans. However, due to a decrease of the amount or organic matter coming to the oceans from the land as well as oxygen in the water, life would disappear there too following a similar path to that on Earth's surface. This process would start with the loss of freshwater species and conclude with invertebrates, particularly those that do not depend on living plants such as termites or those near hydrothermal vents such as worms of the genus Riftia. As a result of these processes, multi-cellular lifeforms may be extinct in about 800 million years, and eukaryotes in 1.3 billion years, leaving only the prokaryotes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the later}} seventeenth century both the Presbyterian and Episcopalian {{wings of the}} church had adopted the {{modestly}} sized and plain form of churches that had emerged after the Reformation. Most had a centralised plan {{with two or three}} arms, in a rectangular or T-planned arrangement. Steeples continued to be a major feature, either centrally on the long axis, or on an end gable, as had been the case in pre-Reformation churches. As a result, there was little of the Baroque extravagance in church building seen on the continent and England. Some minor innovations may indicate a move <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> episcopacy in the Restoration era. Lauder Church was built by Bruce in 1673 for the Duke of Lauderdale, who championed the bishops in the reign of Charles II. The Gothic windows may have emphasised antiquity, but its basic Greek cross plan remained within the existing common framework of new churches.|$|E
5|$|Cöln was {{assigned}} to patrols off the island of Heligoland at the outbreak of World War I in early August 1914, as the flagship of Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass. At the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914, the German patrol forces were attacked by superior British forces, including five battlecruisers and several light cruisers. Cöln was initially stationed {{in support of the}} forces on the patrol line. She attempted to reinforce the beleaguered German forces, and encountered Vice Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers. She was hit several times by the battlecruisers' large-caliber guns, but managed to escape in the haze. She inadvertently turned <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> them, however, and was quickly disabled when the battle resumed. The crew abandoned Cöln, but German vessels did not search the area for three days, and only one man survived.|$|E
60|$|Those at {{the table}} had their <b>backs</b> <b>toward</b> me. But for the {{creature}} walking toward us I might have escaped that moment. Slowly the thing approached me, when its attention was attracted by a huge slave chained a few yards to my right. Here the reptile stopped and commenced {{to go over the}} poor devil carefully, and as it did so its <b>back</b> turned <b>toward</b> me for an instant, and in that instant I gave two mighty leaps that carried me out of the chamber into the corridor beyond, down which I raced with all the speed I could command.|$|R
