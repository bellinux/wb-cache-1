2500|$|Reflexivity: A <b>basic</b> <b>choice</b> in {{defining}} a mereological system, {{is whether to}} consider things to be parts of themselves. In naive set theory a similar question arises: whether a set is {{to be considered a}} [...] "subset" [...] of itself. In both cases, [...] "yes" [...] gives rise to paradoxes analogous to Russell's paradox: Let there be an object O such that every object that is not a proper part of itself is a proper part of O. Is O a proper part of itself? No, because no object is a proper part of itself; and yes, because it meets the specified requirement for inclusion as a proper part of O. In set theory, a set is often termed an improper subset of itself. Given such paradoxes, mereology requires an axiomatic formulation.|$|E

5000|$|John Daniel Wild {{wrote the}} {{following}} in 1959: [...] In classical thought, the world (kosmos) {{is viewed as}} a hierarchy of beings whose structure is already fixed apart from human choice. Man is fitted into this closed system and occupies an intermediate position in the hierarchy. He {{has nothing to do with}} determining the meaning of this world-unless he misunderstands it. His proper function is to let its real, cosmic meaning float into his empty mind from the outside, and then to adjust himself to it as it already is. The general pattern of the good life he is to pursue has been inscribed forever on his nature. His freedom has no effect on this end. It is restricted to a choice of means within his reach.In the New Testament, the term kosmos is employed in a very different way. Take, for instance, the saying in the Gospel of John: “He was in the world-and the world knew Him not” (John 1:10). Many other examples of this sort could be quoted from the Johannine literature and the Pauline Epistles. The term world in these passages does not refer to a fixed, objective cosmos, existing in complete independence of man. It refers rather to man and his world together, to man as existing in a certain condition in a world that is relative to him. In his early work Either/Or and his later work Stages on the Way of Life, Kierkegaard tried to work out this man-world conception, showing in a purely phenomenological manner, without any special appeal to faith, how, in fact the <b>basic</b> <b>choice</b> of a way of life effects not only the thought of the human individual, the way he understands himself, but his feelings, his action, the objects of his attention, and the whole structure of his world.

40|$|Most Namibians eat mahangu, {{a coarse}} cereal {{prepared}} from pearl millet. But despite its being a staple, no research {{was done on}} this crop in Namibia before Independence in 1990. For most Namibians, the <b>basic</b> <b>choice</b> of food is between the flour of pearl millet and maize. Of the two, pearl millet is better adapted to semi-arid conditions. Maize does not grow well in the drylands of Namibia, which have low and unpredictable rainfall, consequently maize flour has to be imported. But farmers have now been introduced to a new variety of pearl millet, Okashana 1 (also known as ICTP 8203). ICTP 8203 is an open-pollinated pearl millet variety developed at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) at Patancheru, India. The prominent characteristics of the variety are that it gives high grain yield, has a large seed, matures early, has resistance to downy mildew disease and yields well under end-of-season drought conditions. With traditional cultivation practices, Namibian farmers have doubled their pearl millet yields. With improved cultivation practices they could even expect 2. 4 tonnes/ha, about eight times the traditional yield of the crop. The consequence is that Namibia need no longer rely so heavily on maize imports.

Such procedures usually consist of two components: a separability cri-terion and a selection strategy. The most <b>basic</b> <b>choices</b> for the latter are individual ranking, forward search and backward search. Many intermediate methods such as floating search are also available. The forward as well as backward selection may cause lossy evaluation of the criterion and/or overtraining of the final classifier in case of high-dimensional spaces and small sample size problems. Backward selection may also become com-putationally prohibitive. Individual ranking, on the other hand, suffers as it neglects dependencies between features. A new strategy based on a pairwise evaluation has recently been proposed by Bo and Jonassen (Genome Biol 3, 2002) and Pezkalska et al. (Interna...|$|R
