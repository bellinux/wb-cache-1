40|$|A {{research}} {{paper on the}} ecology of fish-eating birds on Lake Kariba {{and their impact on}} fish populations within and beyond the lake. Most fish-eating species which were present in the middle Zambezi valley before inundation still occur on the lake (Donnelly and Donnelly 1983) and only those which occupied specialized habitats now lost through flooding have disappeared or become scarce and restricted (e g. Rufous-bellied Heron, African Skimmer, Little Bittern). White-breasted Cormorants disappeared from the lake after 1963 but have now returned (Hustler et al. 1986, Hustler 1986 a). Species that have colonized the lake include the <b>Black</b> <b>Egret,</b> Lesser Black- backed Gull, Grey-headed Gull and White-winged Black Tern. The last three species have probably responded to the large areas of open water formed by the lake and the increase in fishing activity (Begg 1973, Hustler 1986 b). There is no permanent population of Pelicans on Lake Kariba (Irwin 1981) but small numbers have been recorded periodically in recent years (Hustler 1987). These birds are abundant in shallow lakes such as Lake St. Lucia, South Africa (Whitfield and Cyrus 1978) and Lake Nakuru, Kenya (Vareschi and Jacobs 1984), and are absent from Lake Kariba because there are few suitable shallow areas. Fish-eating birds on the lake can be divided into residents, migrants and vagrants. It is likely that most resident species have increased in number because of the longer shoreline and greater availability of fish. Intra-African or palearctic migrants may be present for up to six months every year but their numbers vary considerably. The present investigations were sponsored for many years by the University of Zimbabwe Research Board and by the Swedish Agency for Research Cooperation with Developing Countries (SAREC) ...|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "great white heron" [...] {{could be}} {{confused}} with great egret, but is larger, with yellow legs {{as opposed to the}} great <b>egret's</b> <b>black</b> legs. The reddish egret (Egretta rufescens) and little blue heron (Egretta caerulea) could be mistaken for the great blue heron, but are much smaller, and lack white on the head and yellow in the bill.

The cocoi is distinguished by a striking white neck and solid black crown, but the duller juveniles are more easily confused. More superficially similar is the slightly smaller grey heron, which may sometimes vagrate to the northern coasts of North America. The grey heron (which occupies the same ecological niche in Eurasia as the great blue heron) has very similar plumage, but has a solidly soft-gray neck.

500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white <b>egret,</b> <b>black</b> kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|R
40|$|Indian subcontinent plays host to {{a number}} of migratory birds in summers as well as winters. It is {{estimated}} that over hundred species of migratory birds fly to India, either in search of feeding grounds or to escape the severe winter of their native habitat. Sandi bird sanctuary was created in 1990 in order to protect and conserve the natural habitation and surroundings and also the marine vegetation for the migratory birds, {{as well as for the}} local people of the region. The term migration is used to describe movements of populations of birds or other animals. There are three types of migrants. One way to look at migration is to consider the distances traveled. The pattern of migration can vary within each category, but is most variable in short and medium distance migrants. The origin of migration is related to the distance traveled. The birds migrating through the area, take shelter on the river front before going to the Sandi Bird sanctuary. The birds generally migrate in the winter months of October-November-December. Bird sanctuary is a popular tourist location. Sandi particularly attracts ornithologists and bird watchers, as many rare migratory birds take refuge in the sanctuary. The bird watching camps arranged to observe the migratory birds at Sandi Bird Sanctuary in the month of October and November 2012. The migratory birds at Sandi Bird Sanctuary include great crested grebe, white storks, black lbis, glossy lbis, spoonbill, ruddy shelduck, pin tail, sholveller, spot bill duck, mallard, gadwall, wigeon, tufted pochard, gargancey teal, common teal, cotton teal, grey lag goose, coot, black tailed godwit, painted stock pin tail snipe, marsh sand piper, common tern, river tern, magpie robin, white wagtail, pied wagtail, common snipe, starlings, white lbis, red crested pochard, common pochard, painted stock, black lbis, curlew, Indian skimmer etc. The resident birds at Sandi Bird Sanctuary include little grebe, darter, purple heron, grey heron, pond heron, night heron, large, medium and little egrets, painted stork, open billed stork, cattle <b>egret,</b> <b>black</b> necked stork(endangered), combduck, lesser whistling teal, common pariah kite, brahminy kite, shikra, sparrow, hawk, tawny eagle, greater spotted eagle, crested hawk eagle, lagger falcon rain quail, jungle bush quail, painted bush quail, black partridge, grey partridge, common peafowl, water hens, purple moor hens, jacanas, black winged stilt, lap wing, blue rock pigeon, dove spp., parakeets, crow pheasants, owl, swifts, kingfishers, blue jay, hoopoe, mynas, crow, drongo, bulbul, babblers, cormorants, sarus cranes, etc. There are 38195 local birds and 11378 migratory birds (total 49572) observed during period of study.
