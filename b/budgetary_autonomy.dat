The areas considered for analysis include <b>autonomy,</b> <b>budgetary</b> issues, accountability, political interference, the effects on decentralization, the long-term role of social funds, and exit strategies. The study reveals that a clear vision of the role of social funds with respect to other public and private institutions, can help in a program design that integrates public sector management and institutional issues into all stages of the project cycle. More specifically, the study recommends that social funds be designed to act as catalysts toward public sector reforms, by grafting their positive features and incentives onto government structures. ...|$|R

40|$|For {{more than}} three decades {{healthcare}} decentralization has been promoted in developing countries as a way of improving the financing and delivery of public healthcare. Decision autonomy under healthcare decentralization would determine the role and scope of responsibility of local authorities. Jalal Mohammed, Nicola North, and Toni Ashton analyze decision autonomy within decentralized services in Fiji. They conclude that the narrow decision space allowed to local entities might have limited the benefits of decentralization on users and providers. To discuss {{the costs and benefits of}} healthcare decentralization this paper uses the U-form and M-form typology to further illustrate the role of decision autonomy under healthcare decentralization. This paper argues that when evaluating healthcare decentralization, it is important to determine whether the benefits from decentralization are greater than its costs. The U-form and M-form framework is proposed as a useful typology to evaluate different types of institutional arrangements under healthcare decentralization. Under this model, the more decentralized organizational form (M-form) is superior if the benefits from flexibility exceed the costs of duplication and the more centralized organizational form (U-form) is superior if the savings from economies of scale outweigh the costly decision-making process from the center to the regions. <b>Budgetary</b> and financial <b>autonomy</b> and effective mechanisms to maintain local governments accountable for their spending behavior are key decision autonomy variables that could sway the cost-benefit analysis of healthcare decentralization. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine the variables that explain the geographical expansion and armed activity of Colombian irregular groups since the mid seventies, taking into account the role of the political, fiscal and budgetary decentralization and its effects over local governance. This period of Colombian history (1974 - 2004) has been graved by strong economic, social and institutional changes that have deepened particularly since the decentralization process of the mid eighties. In fact, this paper states that decentralization process transformed the conflict into a dispute over the local power, intensifying the use of violence in order to appropriate part of the public goods and resources, interfere the political process and consolidate the groupÂ´s territorial control. The analysis of the illegal groupÂ´s early activity (1974 - 1982) shows that the use of violence is explained by grievances such as poverty or inequality. However, subsequent years reveal deep changes in the illegal groupÂ´s strategic procedures in which the decentralization process have given them incentives to control the local governments by using violence (greed). The results demonstrate a strong and significant relationship between the intensification of the armed conflict and the greater political, <b>budgetary</b> and fiscal <b>autonomy</b> of local governments. In fact, the presence of local resources such as royalties and taxes triggers violence against politicians being more intense in the municipalities where the actions of the illegal groups are higher.

The Palestinians signed a memorandum of intent on November 8, 1999 with British Gas and a company linked to the Palestinian Authority, the Consolidated Contractors Company, giving them rights to explore the area. According to Michael Schwartz, Barak deployed the Israeli navy in Gaza's coastal waters to impede {{the implementation of the}} terms of the modest contract between the Palestinian Authority and British Gas (BG) to develop Gaza's Mediterranean gas resources. Israel demanded that the Gaza gas be piped to facilities on its territory, and at a price below the prevailing market level and that Israel also control all the (relatively modest) revenues destined for the Palestiniansâto prevent the money from being used to [...] "fund terror." [...] In Schwartz's view, with this Israeli action the Oslo Accords were officially doomed, because by declaring Palestinian control over gas revenues unacceptable, the Israeli government committed itself to not accepting even the most limited kind of Palestinian <b>budgetary</b> <b>autonomy,</b> let alone full sovereignty.

This paper first reviews {{the evolution of the}} "new" performance budgeting model, increasingly being applied in industrial countries. By identifying its main components, the tasks faced by {{emerging market}} economies when converting their present budget systems to this model are determined. It is recognized that this conversion will not be easy and will require four major reform elements. First, any existing program structure must be set in the wider context of strategic budget planning and medium-term budget frameworks. Second, this typically involves redesigning and refining existing program structures. Third, existing budget-costing systems and associated skills will probably need to be improved. Fourth, and perhaps most difficult, a new system of accountability and budget incentives needs to be introduced.

40|$|Our {{objective}} {{is to determine the}} variables that explain the armed activity of irregular groups since the mid- 1970 s and to establish the possible causes of their expansion up to 2002, especially in terms of decentralisation (understood as the increased political, <b>budgetary</b> and administrative <b>autonomy</b> of local government). Over the past 30 years, Colombia has experienced profound changes at an economic, social and institutional level. Not only has the process of urbanisation been consolidated {{at the same time as}} the participation of agriculture in GDP has fallen, but the process of decentralisation has accelerated since the mid- 1980 s. We believe that decentralisation turned the conflict into a dispute for local power. This is manifested in the use of violence to gain control of public goods and services, to influence political and electoral results of interest to the irregular groups, and to consolidate local-level territorial control. The analysis of early guerrilla activity (1974 - 1982) shows socio-economic factors (poverty, inequality) to be the greatest variables. However, from the mid- 1980 s guerrilla activity is linked to the process of decentralisation, which created incentives for irregular groups to consolidate local power bases via the use of violence. The Stateâs weakness in the monopoly of force and the administration of justice facilitated the guerrilla groupsâ expansion and the intensification of their armed activities, as well as those of the illegal âself-defence groupsâ. The statistical and econometric results reveal a strong connection between the intensification of armed activities and local governmentsâ greater political independence and fiscal strength. This study used new historical data on the conflict, and new municipal economic, fiscal, social and political information.

However, not least given the <b>budgetary</b> <b>autonomy</b> of the individual federal states and their influence on federal legislation, for several years central government failed to bring the German deficit ratio back below the Maastricht threshold by means of consolidation measures. Recourse to temporary measures remained limited, while Eurostat was reluctant to accept deficit-decreasing entries in the national accounts. With regard to national fiscal rules, asset sales and securitisations were used to avoid too obvious conflicts. Following the significant decrease in budget deficits experienced since the end of 2005, current European and national fiscal rules are now respected without circumventions.

Most {{of the challenges}} they face are of a statutory nature and are therefore common to all judges, regardless their subject matter jurisdiction. The legal framework {{as well as the}} political culture makes the judiciary dependent upon the executive branch of government, almost entirely.

We then provide a diagnosis of accountability mechanisms, examining their quality of functioning and distortions and constraints. In particular, we analyze to what extent, and through what mechanisms, lower-level governments are held accountable to higher-level governments, the extent to which policies of subnational governments are affected by the competition for mobile firms, taxpayers, and investment capital, the functioning of credit markets, including the responsiveness of subnational governments to credit ratings and bond yields, and the role of democratic electoral channels at national and subnational levels in providing accountability in the provision of subnational public goods. Next, we review the implications of the intergovernmental system and accountability mechanisms on the cooperation of subnational governments and the quality of service delivery. We examine the resources and capacity of the subnational entities that are responsible for key services such as water, sanitation, education and health care, and the impacts of decentralization on service quality and the distribution of benefits among elected officials, citizens and interest groups.

40|$|The Federal Reserve System {{has come}} to occupy center stage in the {{formulation}} and implementation of national and global economic policy. And yet, the mechanisms through which the Fed creates that policy are rarely analyzed. Scholars, central bankers, and other policymakers assume that the Fed 2 Ì 7 s independent authority to make policy is created by law-specifically, the Federal Reserve Act, which created removability protection for actors within the Fed, long tenures for Fed Governors, and <b>budgetary</b> <b>autonomy</b> from Congress. This Article analyzes these assumptions about law and argues that nothing about Fed independence is as it seems. Removability protection does not exist for the Fed Chair, but it exists in unconstitutional form for the Reserve Bank presidents. Governors never serve their full fourteen-year terms, giving every President since FDR twice the appointments that the Federal Reserve Act anticipated. And the budgetary independence designed in 1913 bears little relation to the budgetary independence of 2015. This Article thus challenges the prevailing accounts of agency independence in administrative law and central bank independence literature, both of which focus on law {{as the basis of}} Fed independence. It argues, instead, that the life of the Act-how its terms are interpreted, how its legal and economic contexts change, and how politics and individual personalities influence policymaking- is more important to understanding Fed independence than the birth of the Act, the language passed by Congress.

In the context of Gradual <b>Budgetary</b> <b>Autonomy</b> of Universities, academic TCFs are the object of multiple institutional demands (public service mission: training, world-class research, and revenue-generating commercial activity) that can be potentially contradictory. This article has two objectives: (1) to identify the different institutional demands at play for technological core facilities and the tensions that this could give rise to and (2) to identify the different ways in which these tensions are addressed, illustrating the institutional work of the manager. With a qualitative analysis, ten institutional demands are identified, some of them are potentially contradictory. Findings and practical implicationsThe ways in which demands are balanced help us underline three institutional works made by academic facilities directors; âconciliatory,â âacademic research focused,â or prioritizing âresearch support. â In the studied cases, there is a clear link between the TCFs' founding legal structure and this institutional work. By contrast, the TCF size, the capability of the manager, scientific domain, and current equipment do not differentiate response strategies with respect to institutional demands. In financially challenging times, universities need to define precisely the different missions of TCFs and their potential complementarities, and they also need to be consistent in the selection of their legal form. At the end, this strategic vision of the TCFs activities appears to be a central issue for the university to improve its research and transfer activities. Originality/valueThe multi-level approach â institutional, organizational, and agency â gives account of the clearly contradictory nature of the institutional demands. These contradictory demands make possible an institutional work, and three possible trajectories of the TCFs could be identified.

A proposta desse artigo foi apresentar as concepÃ§Ãµes da educaÃ§Ã£o sanitÃ¡ria, bem como as atividades educativas em saÃºde voltadas especificamente para escolares, buscando articular as concepÃ§Ãµes sespianas com os processos de subjetivaÃ§Ã£o, que podem ou nÃ£o ter contribuÃ­do na produÃ§Ã£o de outras e novas matrizes identitÃ¡rias. Para esse estudo, adotamos o recorte temporal de 1942 a 1960, etapa em que o SESP apresentava-se como agÃªncia bilateral, e dotado de certa autonomia regimental e orÃ§amentÃ¡ria em relaÃ§Ã£o ao antigo MinistÃ©rio da EducaÃ§Ã£o e SaÃºde PÃºblica. Como fontes histÃ³ricas, foram empregadas as suas publicaÃ§Ãµes nesse perÃ­odo, a Revista do SESP e o Boletim do SESP. The Public Health Special Services (ServiÃ§o Especial de SaÃºde PÃºblica - SESP) {{was created}} in 1942 from an agreement between the Brazilian and North American governments, having as functions, the sanitation of regions which produced primary material, such as the rubber from the Amazon region and the iron ores and mica from Vale do Rio Doce. SESP expanded in the rural Brazilian regions, where it built nets of local health units, focusing {{not only on the}} preventive medicine, but also the healing one, having as its main axis, the sanitary education in the most different spaces, among them, at primary schools. The proposal of this article was to present the conceptions of sanitary education, as well as the educational health activities turned specifically to schools, seeking to articulate the sespian conceptions with the subjectivity processes, {{which may or may not}} have contributed in the production of other and new identity formers. For this study, we adopted the time cut from 1942 to 1960, stage when SESP presented itself as a bilateral agency, and gifted with certain regimental and <b>budgetary</b> <b>autonomy</b> in relation to the former Ministry of Education and Public Health. As historical sources, its publications at the time were used, the SESP Magazine and the SESP Bulletin...|$|E
40|$|Background Councils of Chiropractic Education (CCE) {{indirectly}} influence {{patient care}} and safety through their role of ensuring {{the standards of}} training delivered by chiropractic educational institutions. This is achieved by a process of accreditation where CCEs define and assess graduate competencies and educational standards. A previous study comparing CCE graduate competencies found variations between the CCE jurisdictions. It was proffered that variations in standards may potentially compromise patient care and safety and also inter-jurisdictional mutual recognition. This study continues the examination of CCEs by looking for similarities and differences in CCE accreditation standards. There were two purposes of this review. The first was to compare the accreditation standards, domains of accreditation standards, and components of the domains of accreditation standards as represented by the domains of âMission, goals, vision, objectivesâ, âResourcesâ, âFaculty/Academic staffâ, âEducational program/curriculumâ. In addition, we compared the accreditation standards between CCEs {{and those of the}} widely accepted medical accreditation standards of the World Federation of Medical Education (WFME), in order to search for deficiencies and opportunities for improvements in these standards. The second purpose was to make recommendations, if significant deficiencies or variations were found. Method We undertook a systematic review of the similarities and differences between five CCEsâ definitions of an accreditation standard and the descriptive lists of accreditation standards they have adopted. CCE selection criteria and data selection method were undertaken in a systematic manner. This information was tabulated for a comparative analysis and took place in April 2016. Results Only two CCEs had a definition of the term âaccreditation / educational standardâ. At the domain level there was considerably more similarities than differences. The differences became more apparent when the comparisons were made at the component level. These included intended purposes of the mission statement, standards for faculty staff, requirements for clinical training by students, program <b>budgetary</b> <b>autonomy</b> and transparency, the inclusion of chiropractic philosophy and history, and which subjects should be taught in basic, behavioural and clinical sciences. Conclusions A series of recommendations were made. These included the need for an increased clarity of the required basic and clinical science subjects, teaching clinic student requirements, and faculty staff qualifications. These are proposed with the intention of creating uniform and high quality international accreditation standards for chiropractic education. Future research should compare the levels of CCEs inspection standards and processes to see if similarities and differences exist also there...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} regionalism - {{as a form of}} identity and political mobilization - in the multiethnic northern Serbian province of Vojvodina, which has until today been spared of inter-ethnic violence that has characterized all other constitutive regions of the former socialist federative Yugoslavia. Based on a study of the development and activities of the Vojvodinian political parties and non-governmental organizations that have sought to wrest autonomy of the region vis- 0 -vis Serbia during both the reign of Slobodan Milosevic's regime and the rule of the democratic coalition that dethroned his party in 2000, as well as numerous surveys on the population's grievances and identities, the following questions are being asked: what is the reason that, despite the steady and rising dissatisfaction with the socio-economic standing of the Province among the ordinary people, and sentiments that manifest regional and inter-ethnic identities, Vojvodinian autonomist parties have failed to mobilize significant political support? Why do they seem to be continuously losing the battle with the Belgrade-based parties for the proclaimed goals of the new constitutional and <b>budgetary</b> <b>autonomy</b> of the Province, which includes greater regulation, and support of its ethnic minority and multiethnic institutions? Why have the autonomist political parties not been able to tie their programs of autonomous status of the Province to the growing socio-economic and cultural grievances of ordinary Vojvodinians Serbs, Hungarians, Slovaks, Croats, Ruthenians, and Rumanians alike? Why have they failed to tie together the long-standing antiwar and anti-ethnonationalist attitudes toward the former Serb-nationalist regime and its 'moderate' successors, which are shared by local elites and ordinary people, and instrumentalize them as a resource in Serbia's post- 2000 transition to democracy? Here I will demonstrate that the Vojvodinian autonomist elites' political strategy has consisted primarily of the deal-making with Serbian Belgrade-based parties, where the polity access has favored the choice of horse trading and distribution of sinecures by both multiethnic and ethnic minority party leaderships. Simultaneously, they have been discouraged to organize large support in their locales. The goals of democracy, understood in this context as raising opportunities for broad political participation and advancement of regional ethnic and multiethnic practices, are thus being continuously preempted. The second question that calls for attention here is whether the theory and policies of liberal multiculturalism and liberal nationalism (much studied and praised in the region) can offer a model for construction of democratic polities in multiethnic spaces of the post-Communist East-Central Europe. The following section will briefly outline the main argument of liberal multiculturalism-nationalism and its uses for understanding the break-up and reconstructing of multi- and inter-ethic experiences in the former Yugoslavia, as well as local ZEF Discussion Papers on Development Policy 57 prospects for democratization. It will then draw attention to alternative sociological approaches to the problem of political mobilization and recognition of mass grievances and identities that serve as their background. More elaborated suggestions for a suitable theoretical model that can help understand the specific political and cultural set-up that the province of Vojvodina was and is will be presented in the concluding section. Following the section on theoretical schemes, I will present a brief overview of the position of Vojvodina in the federal Yugoslavia and its social and cultural decline after the abolition of its constitutional autonomy in 1988. In the fourth part I will draw a map of political programs and activities of the local autonomist parties. The fifth section will focus on the nongovernmental organizations, depicting their role in researching and framing the grievances, identities and solidarities of ordinary Vojvodinians in terms of evaluation of the prospects for local democratic development. Before the concluding section, I will outline some newest political developments that, {{in the aftermath of the}} 2000 elections, reveal the patterns of intense fights between the members of the Serbian coalition, where the goals of Vojvodinian autonomy and multiethnic identity may be reframed in terms of ethnic divisions and a scramble for sinecures...|$|E
