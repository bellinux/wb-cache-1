25|$|One major {{difference}} between these two approaches is the agent's responsibility. Positive consequentialism demands that we bring about good states of affairs, whereas negative consequentialism requires that we avoid <b>bad</b> <b>ones.</b> Stronger versions of negative consequentialism will require active intervention to prevent bad and ameliorate existing harm. In weaker versions, simple forbearance from acts tending to harm others is sufficient. An example of this is the Slippery Slope Argument, which encourages others to avoid a specified act {{on the grounds that it}} may ultimately lead to undesirable consequences.|$|E
25|$|Tuonela was {{the land}} of dead. It was an {{underground}} home or city for all the dead people, not only the good or the <b>bad</b> <b>ones.</b> It was a dark and lifeless place, where everybody slept forever. Still a brave shaman could travel to Tuonela in trance {{to ask for the}} forefathers' guidance. To travel to Tuonela, the soul had to cross the dark river of Tuonela. If the shaman had a proper reason, then a boat would come to take them over. Many times a shaman's soul had to trick the guards of Tuonela into believing that they were actually dead.|$|E

25|$|Before {{considering}} {{the factors that}} motivate the performance paradox, {{it is important to}} point out that characteristics known as comparability and variability differentiate good performance measures from <b>bad</b> <b>ones.</b> Comparability is defined as the potential to utilize a performance measure across different settings to horizontally compare performance. Variability is essential because it ensures that evaluations can be recorded on an outcome scale that is extended enough to vertically compare different levels of performance. Within organizations, these two properties are impacted by the use of several weakly correlated performance measures through a mechanism termed the running down process.|$|E
25|$|St. Lucy is also {{popular among}} {{children}} {{in some regions}} of North-Eastern Italy, namely Trentino, East Lombardy (Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona, Lodi and Mantua), parts of Veneto, (Verona), parts of Emilia-Romagna, (Piacenza, Parma, Reggio Emilia and Bologna), and all of Friuli, where {{she is said to}} bring gifts to good children and coal to <b>bad</b> <b>ones</b> the night between 12 and 13 December. According to tradition, she arrives {{in the company of a}} donkey and her escort, Castaldo. Children are asked to leave some coffee for Lucia, a carrot for the donkey and a glass of wine for Castaldo. They must not watch Santa Lucia delivering these gifts, or she will throw ashes in their eyes, temporarily blinding them.|$|E
25|$|Unsupervised {{learning}} {{is the ability}} to find patterns in a stream of input. Supervised learning includes both classification and numerical regression. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change. In reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for <b>bad</b> <b>ones.</b> The agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space. These three types of learning can be analyzed in terms of decision theory, using concepts like utility. The mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory.|$|E

25|$|Brown was a leg-spinner in his youth, {{but turned}} to medium paced bowling after the war. He {{was able to}} turn or cut the ball with his large hands and was a wicket taker rather than a {{container}} of batsmen, but sometimes lost his line and length. As a pace bowler he was more accurate, was able to tie down even the best batsmen and proved adept at breaking solid partnerships. In particular {{he was able to}} dismiss the stonewalling Australian captain Lindsay Hassett. He still used his leg-spin when required by conditions or the frailties of the batsmen, sometimes mixing them up in the same over. His bucket hands made him a good catcher and he once caught and bowled Keith Miller in both innings of a Test, so the Australian all-rounder nicknamed him 'C and B'. As a batsman he stuck to the simple expedient of blocking the good balls and thumping the <b>bad</b> <b>ones.</b> With his height, weight and strength he could strike the ball as hard as anyone and once hit a six into the Lord's Pavilion. His first-class centuries were noted for their plentiful boundaries and this was another reason why his was popular with the crowds.|$|E
25|$|Protagoras {{states that}} he has two good pieces of {{evidence}} that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally feel as though someone is responsible for not knowing {{something that can be}} taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness in them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes that none of this is surprising, but what would be surprising is if this were not the case (326e). He closes by addressing Socrates' question why, if virtue is teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment where a hypothetical city state is resting its survival as such to the skill of flute playing. Being {{the most important thing for}} that society, parents would be eager to teach the skill to their sons. Not everyone would be successful though, as we can imagine, as some would have a greater natural inclination than others and often the son of a good flute player would turn out bad and vice versa. Any of them however, even the <b>bad</b> <b>ones,</b> would be better than an average citizen in the real world which might have never been taught how to play. Same goes for virtue, it is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree, to the point that it seems like a part of human nature while it is not (327b–d).|$|E
500|$|According to Steven Curtis Chapman, {{the idea}} for [...] "Miracle of the Moment" [...] {{came out of a}} song he had written called [...] "Find Me", which did not end up being {{included}} on This Moment. He reflected that he thought [...] "God was just saying 'I really just want you to be present in this moment - the good ones, the <b>bad</b> <b>ones</b> - all that'". [...] "Miracle of the Moment" [...] was written and produced by Chapman and Matt Bronlewee. It was mixed by F. Reid Shippen and mastered by Ted Jensen.|$|E
60|$|Once {{there he}} {{replaced}} {{the ball in}} the bag, and looked carefully round him. The door of the <b>Bad</b> <b>One's</b> hut was open, and he saw that the ceiling was supported by great wooden beams, from which hung the bags of gold and the little bridge. He saw, too, the <b>Bad</b> <b>One</b> sitting {{in the midst of his}} treasures eating his dinner, and drinking something out of a horn. It was plain to the boy that he must invent some plan of getting the <b>Bad</b> <b>One</b> out of the way, or else he would never be able to steal the gold or the bridge.|$|R

He compiled his own index for the book, [...] "and swore a mighty oath, when I had finished the task, that I would rather die, and in a particularly unpleasant manner, than do it again". He contrived to include in his index an obscene joke {{at the expense of}} the hapless prosecutor in the Chatterley trial, but found the difficulty of indexing so great that he became a champion of the Society of Indexers. [...] He wrote several articles on the subject, and when reviewing books made a point of praising good indexes and condemning <b>bad</b> <b>ones.</b>|$|E
500|$|The lyrics {{speak of}} a love connection, where the protagonist makes bad decisions; [...] "I never was smart with love, I let the <b>bad</b> <b>ones</b> in and the good ones go". In the chorus, Robyn sings [...] "I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before/I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music noted that Robyn sings [...] "tough and knowing" [...] and [...] "pessimistically optimistic" [...] lines, but manages {{to make it sound}} romantic for the listener. Emma Gaedekke of Billboard commented on the lyrical content, saying, [...] "Robyn's heartfelt vocal turn {{prevents}} the backing music from overwhelming her story of a love connection found at the tail-end of heartbreak." ...|$|E

Reyes finds Doggett and faces gunfire from the police, who are likewise controlled by the cartel; all the while, Reyes attempts to remind Doggett of who they are. Doggett remembers his son. The agents are rescued by Skinner and the Mexican Federales. Doggett tearfully admits that he is happy to have all of his memories, even the <b>bad</b> <b>ones,</b> [...] "as long as I remember the good.” ...|$|E

'Oh, how stupid of me not to think of that before!' said he, and he wished with all his might that the <b>Bad</b> <b>One</b> should become very hungry--so hungry that he could not wait a moment for fresh food to be brought to him. And sure enough at that instant the <b>Bad</b> <b>One</b> called out to his servant, 'You did not bring food that would satisfy a sparrow Fetch some more at once, for I am perfectly starving.' Then, without giving the woman {{time to go to the}} larder, he got up from his chair, and rolled, staggering from hunger, towards the kitchen.|$|R

500|$|Modern reviews {{have been}} largely critical– Brett Alan Weiss, writing for AllGame, {{considered}} the game to be a [...] "slower, less intense, less enjoyable" [...] version of Kaboom!. He criticized {{the lack of support}} for the paddle controller, and stated that not even the two-player and terrorist modes made the game enjoyable. In his book Classic Home Video Games, Weiss wrote that Lost Luggage was a [...] "fleeting pleasure", opining that [...] "the airplanes flying overhead look nice, {{but the rest of the}} game is ordinary in appearance" [...] and that the difficulty curve and action were poor. Writing for Atari HQ, Keita Iida commented that [...] "there are good Kaboom! clones (Eggomania) and then there are <b>bad</b> <b>ones</b> (this one)." [...] Iida believed that if the game was not as similar to Kaboom! then it would be [...] "mildly amusing", but that the better alternatives hampered it.|$|E
500|$|The {{tribes of}} Southern Saudi Arabia and Northern Yemen were closely linked, and the Saudis enticed {{thousands}} of Yemeni workers in Saudi Arabia {{to assist the}} royalist cause. In addition to the Saudis and British, the Iraqis also sent plane loads of Baathist Yemenis to undermine Sallal's regime. The royalists fought for the Imam despite his father's unpopularity. One sheik said [...] "The Imams have ruled us for a thousand years. Some were good and some bad. We killed the <b>bad</b> <b>ones</b> sooner or later, and we prospered under the good ones". The hill tribes were Shia, like the Imam, while the Yemenis of the coast and the south were Sunni, as were most Egyptians. President Sallal was himself a mountain Shia fighting with lowland Sunnis. Al-Badr himself was convinced that he was Nasser's biggest target, saying [...] "Now I'm getting my reward for befriending Nasser. We were brothers, but when I refused to become his stooge, he used Sallal against me. I will never stop fighting. I will never go into exile. Win or lose, my grave will be here".|$|E
500|$|The {{figure of}} Third, {{seated on the}} highest throne in the hall, {{responds}} {{that there will be}} many good places to live, but also many <b>bad</b> <b>ones.</b> Third states that the best place to be is Gimlé in the heavens, where a place exists called Okolnir that houses a hall called Brimir—where one can find plenty to drink. Third describes a hall made of red gold located in Niðafjöll called Sindri, where [...] "good and virtuous men will live." [...] Third further relates an unnamed hall in Náströnd, the beaches of the dead, that he describes as a large repugnant hall facing north that is built from the spines of snakes, and resembles [...] "a house with walls woven from branches;" [...] the heads of the snakes face the inside of the house and spew so much venom that rivers of it flow throughout the hall, in which oath breakers and murderers must wade. Third here quotes Völuspá stanzas 38 to 39, with the insertion of original prose stating that the worst place of all to be is in Hvergelmir, followed by a quote from Völuspá to highlight that the dragon Níðhöggr harasses the corpses of the dead there.|$|E

Breeds told Miller {{that she could}} not discuss her departure because of her contract with the series. She added that [...] "Ruby is still very much alive, I'm not free of Ruby just yet". Two months later, the Daily Star's Susan Hill announced that Ruby decides to leave Summer Bay after she makes [...] "an emotional visit" [...] to her mother's grave. She then realises that she needs to move on from recent events and the only way she can do that is to leave the Bay. A spokesperson told Hill [...] "Ruby knows that to save her life she must leave for a fresh start. It's going to be emotional as she has so many good memories but the <b>bad</b> <b>ones</b> are all she can think of." [...] However, Ruby leaves Summer Bay after she confesses to tampering with the brakes of a car, which resulted in Dexter Walker (Charles Cottier) being seriously injured. Ruby regrets what she has done and hands herself in to the police after saying goodbye to Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke). Breeds thanked her fans on Twitter, saying [...] "Thank you. Such beautiful feedback. So sad that it's all over, but kind of relieved to let poor Ruby go and heal... And my Eyes.. Love you." ...|$|E
500|$|At their {{commercial}} {{peak in the}} 1980s, {{the music}} of Genesis faced the accusation of being [...] "flabbergastingly insignificant" [...] by leading American music critic Robert Hilburn, {{and it has been}} described as [...] "barely distinguishable" [...] from Collins's solo work. According to Rolling Stones Erik Hedegaard, Collins in particular was blamed by those who accused the band of selling out. [...] Retrospectively, The New Rolling Stone Album Guide critic J. D. [...] Considine documented how the band had been [...] "largely ignored" [...] by the music press and public in their earliest years, before being [...] "derided as middlebrow throwbacks still in thrall to the pomposities of art rock" [...] in the late 1970s and then dismissed as [...] "easy-listening lightweights" [...] in the 1980s. He argued this was unfair, as the band had made their [...] "share of mediocre albums" [...] but no <b>bad</b> <b>ones.</b> Q reviewer Andy Fyfe wrote in 2007 that [...] "little of the band's output has aged well" [...] and [...] "transcends in the way real classics do", suggesting they would [...] "remain perennial whipping boys for decades to come." [...] However, The Daily Telegraph chief rock music critic Neil McCormick has said that Genesis were [...] "a daring and groundbreaking band (certainly in their early career)", described Collins as [...] "an outstanding drummer" [...] and stated that [...] "after Gabriel left, he stepped up to prove himself a charismatic frontman with a very distinctive vocal character".|$|E
