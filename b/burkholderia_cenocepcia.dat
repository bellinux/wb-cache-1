There are problems mainly with strains which are capable of epidemic spread. The known epidemic in the Czech Republic was caused by ST 32 strain in the past. In this work, there was completed whole genome sequence of referential isolate 1232 of B. cenocepacia ST 32 in cooperation with bioinformatics by new generation sequencing techniques and by determining the problematic areas by a combination of Sanger sequencing bioinformatics approaches and manual assembling of sequence reads localized in these areas. The final version of the genome sequence was annotated by PGAAP and at the present time it is finalized. Second part of this work is dedicated to looking for a prognostic marker of infection caused by ST 32 strain in patients with cystic fibrosis. We analysed the results of ST 32 trancriptomic experiment and chose genes possibly connected with the cepacia syndrome - serious, mostly fatal state of infection. By quantitative PCR we compared their expression in isolates from 4 patients from time of cepacia syndrome and month before that. We checked the possibility of direct detection of the expression of these genes in clinical material. We identified genes for type III secretion system as [...] ...|$|E
