50|$|The {{compound}} tool {{differs from}} progressive and stage tools by {{the arrangement of}} the punch and die. It is an inverted tool where <b>blanking</b> <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> takes place in a single stage and also the blanking punch will act as the piercing die.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Blanking</b> <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> are {{shearing}} {{processes in}} which a punch and die are used to modify webs. The tooling and processes are the same between the two, only the terminology is different: in blanking the punched out piece is used and called a blank; in piercing the punched out piece is scrap. The process for parts manufactured simultaneously with both techniques is often termed [...] "pierce and blank." [...] An alternative name of piercing is punching.|$|E
50|$|For the {{creation}} of dies for producing jewelry and badges, or <b>blanking</b> <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> (through use of a pancake die) by the coinage (stamping) process, the positive master may be made from sterling silver, since (with appropriate machine settings) the master is significantly eroded and is used only once. The resultant negative die is then hardened and used in a drop hammer to produce stamped flats from cutout sheet blanks of bronze, silver, or low proof gold alloy. For badges these flats may be further shaped to a curved surface by another die. This type of EDM is usually performed submerged in an oil-based dielectric. The finished object may be further refined by hard (glass) or soft (paint) enameling and/or electroplated with pure gold or nickel. Softer materials such as silver may be hand engraved as a refinement.|$|E
2500|$|The process starts by {{heating the}} bar to [...] in less than 60 seconds using {{high-power}} induction coils. It is then descaled with rollers, sheared into <b>blanks,</b> <b>and</b> transferred through several successive forming stages, during which it is upset, preformed, final forged, <b>and</b> <b>pierced</b> (if necessary). This process can also be coupled with high-speed cold-forming operations. Generally, the cold forming operation will do the finishing stage so that the advantages of cold-working can be obtained, while maintaining the high speed of automatic hot forging.|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{evolution}} of micorelectronics is placing greater {{demands on the}} packaging technology of integrated circuits (IC), the trend being towards higher lead counts, smaller lead width, finer lead pitch and thinner leadframes. These demands impose stringent requirements {{on the quality of}} dam-bar cutting, the latter being a mechanical trimming process in which the dam bar btween the leads of an IC package after post-molding process is pierced out. The leadframe thickness and the area of cutting are in the order of one tenth of a millimeter and cutting is performed at a much higher speed than that found in conventional <b>blanking</b> <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> processes. In this work, a purposely built single-punch dam-bar cutting press was constructed. The effects of percentage punch-die clearance, punch shear and the plastic anisotropy of the leadframe materials on the cutting force and energy, {{and the quality of the}} sheared edge of the dam-bar, were studied. The optimum punch-die clearance for minimum cutting energy was established. The cutting force, energy and burr height were found to be affected by the plastic anisotropy of the virgin leadframe materials. These findings can be applied in the design of trimming tools used in the dam-bar cutting of IC packages. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|AISI D 6 is an {{alternative}} tool steel used as die <b>and</b> punch in <b>blanking,</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> cold forming processes. Tooling service life is limited by plastic deformations, wear and rupture due {{to the presence of}} high stresses and cracks. Present work evaluates the critical stress intensity factor K 1 C of AISI D 6 tool steel with and without heat treatment, using the three point bending test of a notched beam or SENB specimen. Initially, a pre-crack was performed by fatigue in the notched specimen assembled in a pre-cracking mechanical equipment developed in laboratory. The fracture toughness tests were carried out in SENB specimen according to the ASTM E 399 standard. The Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics approach was used to calculate fracture toughness of D 6 tool steel heat treated and the Compliance Method of Non-linear Fracture Mechanics was utilised for calculating fracture toughness of D 6 tool steel as received. The material microstructures were characterised by micrographs in an optical microscope and the ruptured surface was examined by SEM photographs. The obtained fracture toughness medium values KIC were 25. 9 MPam 1 / 2 and 44 MPam 1 / 2 respectively for AISI D 6 heat treated and as received, indicating a decrease in ductility due the heat treatment. Although, yield stress has increased 40 %. The different fracture mechanisms are also shown. 1...|$|R

40|$|With the {{significantly}} {{increasing demand}} {{on a large}} scale of miniaturized parts, the fabrication of micro-parts by directly using sheet metal is proven to be a promising and efficient micro-manufacturing process. In this process chain, shearing is used to pre-pierce hole or blank cylindrical part. In this research, the material deformation behavior and the fracture effect in shearing are extensively studied and it is revealed that they {{have a significant effect on}} the subsequent operations and the quality of the fabricated parts. In addition, the influence of forming conditions on deformation behavior, fractured surface quality and dimensional accuracy in shearing operation are systematically investigated. The interactive effects of multi-factors including grain size, lubricated condition and shear velocity on the quality of both the <b>blanked</b> part <b>and</b> the <b>pierced</b> hole are discussed. It is revealed that the forming quality deteriorates with the increase of grain size and shear velocity. High viscosity lubricant leads to low deformation load and small work hardening as well as good surface finish. The rag at the <b>pierced</b> hole edge <b>and</b> the surface breakages on the blanked part exist under high shear velocity, and the shear velocity should be controlled within a certain limit to balance the productivity and surface quality. Furthermore, the ultimate shear strength, billet diameter and burr height have the extreme values when the initial grain size equals to the punch-die clearance. Therefore, the deformation behavior and the product quality in micro shearing process is affected by the interactive effect of material state, die dimension, lubricated condition and shear velocity.

40|$|Tattoos <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> {{are part}} of the mankind since time began. It {{is by no means a}} matter of new fashion. Until recently, tattoos <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> was {{attributed}} to a fringe group of the population. Today, this body art is influenced by the fashion industry and music. However, during the application of tattoos <b>and</b> <b>piercing,</b> infection or blood-borne diseases can be transmitted. It is an activity in which the integrity of human skin is damaged. Therefore, in my diploma paper I deal with the issue of informedness about the risks of infection at tattoo <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> parlours. The main objective was to find out about the level of informedness of students at the Faculty of Health and Social Studies of the University of South Bohemia (ZSF JU) about the presence of infection and the possible risk of its transmission at tattoo <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> parlours. A secondary objective was to compare the level of knowledge of people with tattoos or body <b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> those without them. In this paper, the experience of ZSF JU students with tattoo <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> parlours <b>and</b> the knowledge about blood-borne diseases were described. This diploma paper used a quantitative research, through the form of an anonymous questionnaire. The group of respondents consisted of students at ZSF JU. The paper presented three hypotheses and the research results bring the following evident conclusions: H 1 : The population is not sufficiently informed about the risk of infection at tattoo <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> parlours. This hypothesis was refuted. H 2 : The informedness of the risk of infection at tattoo <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> parlours is higher for people with tattoos or body piercing than for people without them. It was found out that the informedness of the risk of infection in both groups did not differ statistically. H 3 : People, when choosing a tattoo or piercing parlour, are rather interested in the price than in the quality. This hypothesis was not confirmed. The knowledge obtained can serve as an informative material for the prevention of infection at tattoo <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> parlours...|$|R

In contrast to clipping, <b>blanking,</b> <b>and</b> joint blanking/clipping, where one or two thresholds is used to detect if the impulsive noise occurs, and if the impulsive noise occurs how to handle it, deep clipping is characterized by two alternative parameters, namely, a threshold and a depth factor. By optimizing the two parameters, we find that deep clipping achieves better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance than clipping, <b>blanking,</b> <b>and</b> joint blanking/clipping. In addition, we present a mathematical expression for deep clipping and show that the SNR expressions regarding conventional clipping, <b>blanking,</b> <b>and</b> joint blanking/clipping can be easily obtained by using our analytical methods...|$|R
