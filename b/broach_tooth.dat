40|$|Broaching is a {{precision}} multipoint metal removal operation normally employed for manufacturing variety of complex parts having either {{internal or external}} features. Broaching can produce high precision and good surface finish at a high metal removal rate. The unique feature of a broach tool is that the feed/depth of cut for the teeth {{is built into the}} broach unlike other cutting tools. The tool design (e. g., rise per tooth and tooth geometry) {{play a vital role in}} the broach performance. A specially adapted machine tool modified to investigate a single <b>broach</b> <b>tooth</b> has been used. Cutting forces and material removal rate have been measured during experimental work for different combination of broaching parameters and broach tool geometry. The effect of the parameters on the surface quality produced has been established. The characteristics of chips formed have also been defined. Finally, optimum tooth geometry and rise per tooth have been recommended for tool performance, broached surface quality and efficient chip formation. The information provided in this paper will be beneficial for broach tool designers and manufacturing engineers...|$|E
40|$|Mechanistic model {{assumes that}} the types of cutting force acting on the <b>broach</b> <b>teeth,</b> namely axial force, normal force and lateral force, are {{proportional}} to chip-thickness area. In this paper, the proportionality constants related to the cutting force and chip-thickness area were obtained through experimentation. The shaping process {{was used to determine}} the proportionality constants in terms of specific cutting energy constants. The paper also includes static force modelling for broaching operation and graphical presentation of the experimental and simulated results...|$|R
500|$|For some {{circular}} <b>broaches,</b> burnishing <b>teeth</b> {{are provided}} instead of finishing teeth. They {{are not really}} teeth, as they are just rounded discs that are [...] oversized. This results in burnishing the hole to the proper size. This is primarily used on non-ferrous and cast iron workpieces.|$|R

The {{purpose of the}} work: the {{development}} of the flat files <b>teeth</b> <b>broaching</b> method, and the design methods of broaching. Developed has been the method of control by the parameters of the item teeth formation process by changing the parameters values of the three constructive feeds and its combinations on the broaching outting part, the construction of which allows to exclude the process of the formrelieved teeth. The algorithm of the flat broaching design, as well as methods for the design of the minor-dimensional <b>teeth</b> obtaining <b>broaching</b> and the high-technologibroaching constructions have been developed. The constructive and technological limits for using the suggested method of braching and tool have been determined, the technological methods for performing the operations on the formation of the broaching operating surface have been developed. The experimental-industry tests of the installation and tools have been performed in the Production Association "Orelmestprom" and Scientific-Production Firm "Anton". The positive results have been obtained. The efficiency of the introduction: the improvement of the teeth formation process capacity by 2 times, the increase of the material to be filed by the broached files is by 21. 3 %Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring machining, new {{surfaces}} are generated. Depending on the machining process, different qualities of {{surfaces are}} produced. After broaching, a high surface quality is expected. However, the quality can {{be influenced by}} vibrations of the machine structure which leads to varying cutting thicknesses and thus to low surface qualities. The influence of variable cutting thicknesses during machining was investigated experimentally and by means of simulations. Dynamic changes in cutting thickness were considered as geometrical profiles on the uncut surfaces. Process forces were measured during the experiments and the roughness before and after <b>broaching</b> with one <b>tooth</b> was evaluated. The residual stresses in the workpiece surfaces were simulated with an already validated model of orthogonal machining using a self-implemented re-meshing method...|$|R
