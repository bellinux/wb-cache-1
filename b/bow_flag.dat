50|$|The first Ocean type vessel {{launched}} was Ocean Vanguard on 16 August 1941.

6000|$|He {{crawled out}} on the veranda. The rain had ceased, but the wind, which had dwindled to a half-gale, was increasing. A big sea had sprung up, and the mile-long breakers, curling up to the over-fall two hundred yards from shore, were {{crashing}} on the beach. The Jessie was plunging madly to two anchors, and every second or third sea broke clear over her <b>bow.</b> Two <b>flags</b> were stiffly undulating from the halyards like squares of flexible sheet-iron. One was blue, the other red. He knew their meaning in the Berande private code--"What are your instructions? Shall I attempt to land boat?" [...] Tacked on the wall, between the signal locker and the billiard rules, was the code itself, by which he verified the signal before making answer. On the flagstaff gaff a boy hoisted a white flag over a red, which stood for--"Run to Neal Island for shelter." ...|$|R

One plane which had retained its bombs proceeded down the Whangpoo and dropped two bombs which exploded in the water off Augustas starboard <b>bow.</b> Large American <b>flags</b> were then painted on top of Augustas three main battery gunhouses to identify her as neutral.|$|R
60|$|At length every {{formality}} {{had been}} duly observed, and the competitors assumed their places. The gondolas were {{much larger than}} those commonly used, and each was manned by three watermen in the centre, directed by a fourth, who, standing on the little deck in the stern, steered, while he aided to impel the boat. There were light, low staffs in the <b>bows,</b> with <b>flags,</b> that bore the distinguishing colors of several noble families of the Republic, or which had such other simple devices as had been suggested by the fancies of those to whom they belonged. A few flourishes of the oars, resembling the preparatory movements which the master of fence makes ere he begins to push and parry, were given; a whirling of the boats, like the prancing of curbed racers, succeeded; and then, at the report of a gun, the whole darted away as if the gondolas were impelled by volition. The start {{was followed by a}} shout, which passed swiftly along the canal, and an eager agitation of heads that went from balcony to balcony, till the sympathetic movement was communicated to the grave load under which the Bucentaur labored.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, {{however, the}} Magpies surged {{up the ladder}} {{to qualify for the}} finals, while the next year they went within one game - albeit a game in which they were {{conclusively}} vanquished by Burnie - of a flag. The 2005 season brought another grand final appearance, and another loss to Burnie, albeit this time by the comparatively more respectable margin of just 17 points. Then, in 2006, hopes that it might be third time lucky were conclusively dashed on grand final day by a much more talented and cohesive Launceston side, which ultimately won with ease by 57 points. The 2007 season brought a marginal decline in fortunes as the Magpies, having topped the ladder prior to the finals, <b>bowed</b> out of <b>flag</b> contention in straight sets after defeats by eventual premiers Launceston in the second semi final, and Ulverstone in the preliminary final. Kurt Heazlewood's Baldock Medal victory as the competition's best and fairest player provided a small measure of consolation.|$|R
5000|$|The two extant {{martial arts}} {{at the time of}} Japanese take over in 1910, Ssireum and Gungdo grew in {{popularity}} during the Japanese occupation period, both of them founding their current federations in 1920. Many of the oldest Gungdo clubs in Seoul, including Hwanghakjeong (near Gyeongbokgung Palace) and Sukhojeon on Namsan (Seoul) were founded in the 1930s. Taekkyeon did not enjoy much popularity during the occupation era. It has grown in popularity only in the 21st century through the continuance of Song Duk Ki. Most Koreans learned Japanese martial arts during the occupation period, which eventually evolved into Korean martial arts. These include Tae Kwon Do, Soo Bahk Do, Tang Soo Do, Moo Duk Kwan,ˌ Kuk Sool Won* and Kumdo. The main indicator of their Japanese origin is in their uniform, ranking system, and rules. Traditional Korean clothing (Hanbok) has no belt. Belts used in judo and karate, to include the color code and Geup (Kyu) / Dan (rank) system were adopted wholesale by the Koreans. [...] Rules, to include <b>bowing</b> to the <b>flag,</b> and to the master* are direct copies from Japanese martial arts and not found in Ssireum, Gungdo and Taekkyeon. the International Tang Soo Do Federation‹唐手道 南仁道› ...|$|R
