40|$|Abstract. This study {{deals with}} the {{nonlinear}} dynamics associated with large deformation of a <b>beam</b> <b>sliding</b> on two-knife edge supports under external excitation. The beam {{is referred to as}} a Gospodnetic–Frisch-Fay beam, after the researchers who reported its static deformation in closed form. The freedom of the <b>beam</b> to <b>slide</b> on its supports imparts a nonlinear characteristic to the force-deflection response. The restoring elastic force of the beam possesses characteristics {{similar to those of the}} roll-restoring moment of ships. The Gospodnetic–Frisch-Fay exact solution is given in terms of elliptic functions. A curve fit of the exact solution up to eleventh-order is constructed to establish the governing equation of motion under external excitation. The dynamic stability of the unperturbed beam is examined for the damped and undamped cases. The undamped case reveals periodic orbits and one homoclinic orbit depending on the value of the initial conditions. The response to a sinusoidal excitation at a frequency below the linear natural frequency is numer-ically estimated for different excitation amplitude and different values of initial conditions covered by the area of the homoclinic orbit. The safe basins of attrac-tion are plotted for different values of excitation amplitude. It is found that the safe region of operation is reduced as the excitation amplitude increases...|$|R

40|$|Sidles and Sigg {{have shown}} that {{advanced}} LIGO interferometers will encounter a serious tilt instability, in which symmetric tilts of the mirrors of an arm cavity cause the cavity's light <b>beam</b> to <b>slide</b> sideways, so its radiation pressure exerts a torque that increases the tilt. Sidles and Sigg showed that the strength T of this torque is 26. 2 times greater for advanced LIGO's baseline cavities [...] nearly flat spherical mirrors which support Gaussian beams (``FG'' cavities), than for nearly concentric spherical mirrors which support Gaussian beams with the same diffraction losses as the baseline case [...] ``CG'' cavities: T^{FG}/T^{CG} = 26. 2. This has motivated a proposal to change the baseline design to nearly concentric, spherical mirrors. In order to reduce thermoelastic noise in advanced LIGO, O'Shaughnessy and Thorne have proposed replacing the spherical mirrors and their Gaussian beams by ``Mexican-Hat'' (MH) shaped mirrors which support flat-topped, ``mesa'' shaped beams. In this paper we compute the tilt-instability torque for advanced-LIGO cavities with nearly flat MH mirrors and mesa beams (``FM'' cavities) and nearly concentric MH mirrors and mesa beams (``CM'' cavities), with the same diffraction losses as in the baseline FG case. We find that the relative sizes of the restoring torques are T^{CM}/T^{CG} = 0. 91, T^{FM}/T^{CG} = 96, T^{FM}/T^{FG} = 3. 67. Thus, the nearly concentric MH mirrors have a weaker tilt instability than any other configuration. Their thermoelastic noise {{is the same as}} for nearly flat MH mirrors, and is much lower than for spherical mirrors. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures, 4 table...|$|R
40|$|Vibration {{modes of}} a unite-length Timoshenko beam are studied as {{standing}} waves using the wave-train closure principle, {{in order to}} obtain a complete picture of various vibration modes in a beam and to understand the mechanism of their formulations. In particular, the existence of degenerate modes in a beam is investigated. Firstly, it is shown that the two degenerate flexural waves accommodated by an infinite Timoshenko beam are derived from the in-phase'and the out-of-phase relations between transverse vibrations due to bending and shear deformations, respectively. A wave representation of beam vibration is thus developed. Secondly, wave reflection behavior at an elastically supported boundary is analyzed. It is shown that while these two waves are degenerate in an infinite beam, they have to be superposed at the boundary in general, but remain degenerate for certain special boundary conditions. Based on these results, the expression of wave-train closure principle for a finite-length Timoshenko beam is derived, and used to study different standing waves in a beam. It is shown that three types of standing waves (vibration modes) exist in Timoshenko beams, namely, superposed, degenerate, and single. A condition of space synchronization must be satisfied for superposed standing waves. For the other two types of standing waves, this condition is satisfied naturally. While the superposed standing wave is the most general form of vibration mode, vibration modes of elastically supported beams at specific frequencies or <b>beams</b> with <b>sliding</b> and/or simply supported boundary conditions are single standing waves. When additional conditions are satisfied, two single standing waves could exist at the same natural frequency to formulate degenerate standing waves. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
