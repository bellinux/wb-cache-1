40|$|The cyclic {{behavior}} of P/M steel has been evaluated at different tempering conditions. Heat treatment {{is found to}} significantly affect the hardness, micro structure and fatigue response of the material. Optimum tempering temperature is found to give the highest hardness and better fatigue life compare to as-received material. This heat treatment also characterizes the mechanisms of fatigue crack initiations. Three mechanisms are found in this material: (I) crack initiated from <b>broken</b> <b>particle,</b> (2) crack initiated from open pore and (3) crack initiated from interfacial debonding between particle and matrix. It has been observed that, by carefully designing the heat treatment this steel can be beneficially used in fatigue loaded components...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{experimental}} and theoretical {{study of the}} fragmentation of plastic materials is presented. In the experiments polyxymethylen particles of spherical shape were fragmented by impacting them against a hard wall. The experiments revealed a power law distribution of fragment masses similar to heterogeneous brittle materials, however, with a significantly lower exponent. To understand the experimental findings a three dimensional discrete element model is introduced. The model discretizes the sample in terms of randomly sized spheres which are connected by elastic beams. To capture the effect of plasticity a novel type of failure criterion is introduced complemented by a healing mechanism of <b>broken</b> <b>particle</b> contacts under compression. Computer simulations show a good quality agreement with the experimental findings. ...|$|E

By contrast, it is largely unclear how the interplay between cell shape and self-propulsion controls the meso- and macroscale behavior of active matter. Here, we analyze large-scale simulations of homo- and heterogeneous self-propelled particle systems to identify generic effects of <b>broken</b> <b>particle</b> symmetry on collective motion. We find that even small violations of fore-aft symmetry lead to fundamentally different collective behaviors, which may facilitate demixing of differently shaped species {{as well as the}} spontaneous formation of stable micro-rotors. These results suggest that variation of particle shape yields robust physical mechanisms to control self-assembly of active matter, with possibly profound implications for biology and materials design.

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a new class}} of 4 -dimensional z = 2 Lifshitz black branes that have a non-zero linear momentum. These are solutions of an Einstein-Proca-dilaton model that can be obtained by Scherk-Schwarz circle reduction of AdS 5 gravity coupled to a free real scalar field. The boundary of a bulk Lifshitz space-time is a Newton-Cartan geometry. We show that the fluid dual to the moving Lifshitz black brane leads to a novel form of Lifshitz hydrodynamics on a Newton-Cartan space-time. Since the linear momentum of the black brane cannot be obtained by a boost transformation the velocity of the fluid or rather, by boundary rotational invariance, its magnitude plays the role of a chemical potential.

40|$|The {{effect of}} shot peening process {{parameters}} on fatigue life was investigated on a carburized helical gear. In {{most of the}} shot peening parameter optimization cases, once workpiece saturation has exceeded loo%, Almen intensity is the most dominant process parameter and, therefore, is optimized first. Gear tooth bending fatigue lives were evaluated {{as a function of}} Alrnen intensity. Bending fatigue resistance of a carburized gear, shot peened via optimizing Almen intensity, depends on the magnitude and distribution of peening induced compressive residual stresses below the surface and a balance between the benefits of residual stresses and surface damage. TOOTH BENDING FATIGUE is the most common mode of fatigue failure in gearing. Fatigue crack initiation occurs at the surface of the root radius of the tooth where the maximum bending stress is applied. It is well known that shot peening has demonstrated the potential for improvement in fatigue life of gears by introducing residual compressive stresses at and below the surface to retard fatigue crack initiation particularly in the high cycle regime. An extensive review of the improved fatigue performance of gears through shot peening is available in Ref. 1. Optimizing the benefits of the shot peening process requires the identification of critical process parameters and the establishment of optimum levels and tolerances for each parameter. Among many process parameters are shot peening intensity(known as Almen intensity), workpiece saturation, shot size, shot hardness, impact angle, and <b>broken</b> <b>particle</b> content. These parameters are optimized in decreasing order of their influence on fatigue strength. In most cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{finite element}} method is used to study the eects of {{particle}} cluster morphology on the fracture and debonding of silicon particles embedded in an Al– 1 %Si matrix subjected to tensile-compressive cyclic loading conditions. Repre-sentative of an actual cast Al–Si alloy, clusters of silicon inclusions (4 – 8 particles) are considered rather than a single isolated inclusion or an infinite periodic array of inclusions. The silicon particles are modeled with a linear-elastic constitutive relationship and the matrix material is modeled using an internal state variable cyclic plasticity model fitted to experimental data on matrix material. A total of seven parameters are varied to create 16 idealized microstructures: relative particle size, shape, spacing, configuration, alignment, grouping and matrix microporosity. A two-level design of experiment (DOE) methodology is used to screen {{the relative importance of}} the seven parameters on the fracture and debonding of the silicon particles. The results of the study demonstrate that particle shape and alignment are un-doubtedly the most dominant parameters influencing initial particle fracture and debonding. Particle debonding results in a local intensification of stresses in the Al– 1 %Si matrix that is significantly larger than that due to particle fracture. The local stress fields after particle fracture are primarily concentrated within the <b>broken</b> <b>particle</b> halves. After the fracture of several particles within a cluster, the spacing between adjacent particles enters as a second-order eect.

30|$|In PFC 3 D, {{the bond}} between two {{particles}} will fail due to its normal or shear strength being exceeded. Then, the microcrack initiates, the geometry and location of which {{are determined by the}} sizes and current locations of the two parent particles from which the microcrack originated. This means that once two particles break, a microcrack initiates. However, due to the resolution limitation, CT scanning cannot reveal these tiny cracks. Therefore, to maintain consistency with our CT tests, tiny cracks in PFC 3 D were eliminated by FISH programming. This means that if the distance between two <b>broken</b> <b>particles</b> in the PFC model is smaller than 72  µm (the resolution of our CT scanning), the microcrack will not appear in the simulation results.|$|R
40|$|Cone {{penetration}} testing (CPT) {{is one of}} the most versatile devices for in situ soil testing. With minimal disturbance to the ground, it provides information about soil classification and geotechnical parameters. Several researchers have used different numerical techniques such as strain path methods and finite element methods to study CPT problems. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is a useful alternative tool for studying cone penetration problems because of its ability to provide micro mechanical insight into the behaviour of granular materials and cone penetration resistance. This study uses three-dimensional DEM to simulate the cone {{penetration testing}} of granular materials in a calibration chamber. Due to the geometric symmetry of this study a 90 degree segment of the calibration chamber and the cone penetrometer was initially considered followed by a 30 degree segment to allow for the simulation of smaller particle sizes and to reduce computational time. This research proposes a new particle refinement method, similar to the mesh refinement of finite-element modelling, in the sense that a large number of small particles were brought into contact with the cone tip, while the large particles were distanced further away from the cone, to reduce computational time effectively. Using a radius expansion method for sample preparation and assigning a constant mass to each particle in the sample was found to reduce computational time significantly with little influence on tip resistance. The effects of initial sample conditions and particle friction coefficient were found to have an important influence on the tip resistance. In addition, prohibiting particle rotation was found to increase tip resistance significantly compared to when the particles were permitted to rotate freely. Particle shape in this study was simulated by replacing the spheres with simple two-ball clumps and was found to have an important effect on the tip resistance. DEM simulations of biaxial tests were conducted to investigate the effect of initial sample conditions, particle shape and particle friction coefficient on the stress-strain behaviour of granular materials. All the above mentioned parameters were found to have a significant effect on the stress-strain behaviour of granular materials. Biaxial test simulations were also conducted to obtain basic granular material properties to derive analytical CPT solutions from continuum mechanics principles. Some of the DEM simulation results were found to be in good agreement with the analytical solutions that used a combined cylindrical-spherical cavity expansion method. Particle crushing was simulated during the cone penetration tests by replacing a <b>broken</b> <b>particle</b> with two new equi-sized smaller particles with mass conserved. The results showed considerable reduction in the tip resistance for the crushing model compared to the non-crushing model and this reduction increased as the confining stress increased...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in interacting low dimensional quantum systems at zero temperature {{within the framework of}} the functional renormalization group (fRG). Among the several types of spin-orbit interaction the so-called Rashba spin-orbit interaction is especially intriguing for future spintronic applications as it may be tuned via external electric fields. We investigated its effect on the low energy physics of an interacting quantum wire in an applied Zeeman field which is modeled as a generalization of the extended Hubbard model. To this end we performed a renormalization group study of the two particle interaction, including the SOI and the Zeeman field exactly on the single particle level. Considering the resulting two band model, we formulated the RG equations for the two particle vertex keeping the full band structure as well as the non trivial momentum dependence of the low energy two particle scattering processes. In order to solve these equations numerically we defined criteria that allowed us to classify whether a given set of initial conditions flows towards the strongly coupled regime. We found regions in the models parameter space where a weak coupling method as the fRG is applicable and it is possible to calculate additional quantities of interest. Furthermore we analyzed the effect of the Rashba SOI on the properties of an interacting multi level quantum dot coupled to two semi innite leads. Of special interest was the interplay with a Zeeman field and its orientation with respect to the SOI term. We found a renormalization of the spin-orbit energy which is an experimental quantity used to asses SOI effects in transport measurements, as well as renormalized effective g factors used to describe the Zeeman field dependence. In particular in asymmetrically coupled systems the large parameter space allows for rich physics which we studied by means of the linear conductance obtained via the generalized Landauer-Büttiker formalism from the renormalized self energy. The multi level quantum dot exhibits Kondo physics at finite Zeeman fields which can be suppressed if the field and the SOI term are not aligned in parallel. Due to <b>broken</b> <b>particle</b> hole symmetry we observed a gate voltage dependence for finite field conductance plateaus. The computed dependencies have been observed in experiments and thus highlight the flexibility of the considered model. Finally we computed the linear conductance for a multi level quantum dot model that has been proposed to describe SOI and impurity scattering effects in carbon nanotubes (CNT). The SOI was seen to affect the already complicated level structure of the CNT and thus profoundly changes the linear conductance, especially the location of conductance resonances with respect to an applied magnetic field and gate voltage. Again asymmetries influence the conductance and the effects are explained by means of the effective tunnel couplings to the eigenstates of the CNT. We finished with an improved analysis of a reduced version of this model that includes two particle vertex renormalization. The computed linear conductance is in excellent agreement with experimental data...|$|E

To consider whether it was feasible for improving the performance of penetrating projectile we investigated the influence of the convex as one of nonsmooth surfaces for the nose of projectile. A numerical simulation study of the projectile against the concrete target was developed based on the discrete element method (DEM). The results show that the convex nose {{surface of the}} projectile is beneficial for reducing the penetration resistance greatly, which is also validated by the experiments. Compared to the traditional smooth nose structure, the main reason of difference is due to the local contact normal pressure, which increases dramatically due to the abrupt change of curvature caused by the convex at the same condition. Accordingly, the <b>broken</b> <b>particles</b> of the concrete target obtain more kinetic energy and their average radial flow velocities will drastically increase simultaneously, which is in favor of decreasing the interface friction and the compaction density of concrete target around the nose of projectile...|$|R

A growing variety of applications have employed the CPMV multivalent display technology including nanoblock chemistry, in vivo imaging, and materials science. CPMV nanoparticles can be inexpensively produced from experimentally infected cowpea plants at high yields and are extremely stable. Although CPMV has not been shown to replicate in mammalian cells, uptake in mammalian cells does occur in vitro and in vivo. Thus, inactivation of the virus RNA genome is important for biosafety considerations, however the surface characteristics and chemical reactivity of the particles must be maintained in order to preserve chemical and structural functionality. Methodology/Principal Findings: Short wave (254 nm) UV irradiation was used to crosslink the RNA genome within intact particles.
