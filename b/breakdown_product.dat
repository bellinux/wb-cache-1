5|$|The swollen, {{inflamed}} muscle may directly compress {{structures in}} the same fascial compartment, causing compartment syndrome. The swelling may also further compromise blood supply into the area. Finally, destroyed muscle cells release potassium ions, phosphate ions, the heme-containing protein myoglobin, the enzyme creatine kinase and uric acid (a <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> of purines from DNA) into the blood. Activation of the coagulation system may precipitate disseminated intravascular coagulation. High potassium levels may lead to potentially fatal disruptions in heart rhythm. Phosphate binds to calcium from the circulation, leading to low calcium levels in the blood.|$|E

We believe orbital cysts containing blood and blood <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> should be separated into two major categories depending on {{the presence or absence of}} an epithelial or endothelial lining. A hemorrhage into a preexisting lesion such as a dermoid, on lymphangioma, which contains blood <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> lined by an endothelial or epithelial lining, should be referred to as an acute or chronic hematoma in a dermoid or lymphangioma.

5|$|In {{those with}} cirrhosis, {{the risk of}} {{developing}} hepatic encephalopathy is 20% per year, and at any time about 30–45% of people with cirrhosis exhibit evidence of overt encephalopathy. The prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy detectable on formal neuropsychological testing is 60–80%; this increases the likelihood of developing overt encephalopathy in the future. Once hepatic encephalopathy has developed, the prognosis is determined largely by other markers of liver failure, such as the levels of albumin (a protein produced by the liver), the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation, which relies on proteins produced in the liver), the presence of ascites and the level of bilirubin (a <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> of hemoglobin which is conjugated and excreted by the liver). Together with the severity of encephalopathy, these markers have been incorporated into the Child-Pugh score; this score determines the one- and two-year survival and may assist in a decision to offer liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Several unique {{chemicals}} {{are produced by}} Mycena haematopus. The primary pigment is haematopodinB, which is so chemically sensitive (breaking down upon exposure to air and light) that its more stable <b>breakdown</b> <b>product,</b> haematopodin, was known before its eventual discovery and characterization in 2008. A chemical synthesis for haematopodin was reported in 1996. Haematopodins are the first pyrroloquinoline alkaloids discovered in fungi; pyrroloquinolines combine the structures of pyrrole and quinoline, both heterocyclic aromatic organic compounds. Compounds of this type also occur in marine sponges and are attracting research interest due to various biological properties, such as cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines, and both antifungal and antimicrobial activities. Additional alkaloid compounds in M.haematopus include the red pigments mycenarubins D, E and F. Prior {{to the discovery of}} these compounds, pyrroloquinoline alkaloids were considered to be rare in terrestrial sources.|$|E
5|$|Like all Tylopilus species, T.felleus is mycorrhizal. It {{is found}} in {{deciduous}} and coniferous woodland, often under beech and oak in well-drained acid soils, which can be sandy, gravelly or peaty. If encountered on calcareous (chalky) soil, {{it will be in}} moist areas that have become waterlogged and have ample leaf litter. Fruit bodies grow singly or in small groups, and occasionally in small clusters with two or three joined {{at the base of the}} stem. Fruit bodies have also been growing in the cavities of old trees, on old conifer stumps, or on buried rotten wood. The fungus obtains most of its nitrogen requirements from amino acids derived from the breakdown of proteins, although a lesser amount is obtained from the amino sugar glucosamine (a <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> of chitin, a major component of fungal cell walls). The mycorrhizal plant partner benefits from the fungus's ability to use these forms of nitrogen, which are often abundant in the forest floor. Fruit bodies appear over summer and autumn, anytime from June to October or even November, in many of the northern temperate zones. Large numbers may appear in some years, and none in others, generally proportional to the amount of rainfall. Variety uliginosus, known from Michigan, grows among lichens and mosses under pines.|$|E

5|$|Use {{of oxygen}} or sulphur as the {{nucleophilic}} atom causes minor differences in catalysis. Compared to oxygen, sulphur’s extra d orbital makes it larger (by 0.4 Å) and softer, {{allows it to}} form longer bonds (dC-X and dX-H by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower pKa (by 5 units). Serine is therefore more dependent than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its pKa {{in order to achieve}} concerted deprotonation with catalysis. The low pKa of cysteine works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first tetrahedral intermediate as unproductive reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable <b>breakdown</b> <b>product.</b> The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to protonate the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires serine to be re-protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S−. Sterically, the sulphur of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier van der Waals radius and if mutated to serine can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site.|$|E

40|$|Background—The {{nature of}} the <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> {{produced}} in enterocytes during epithelial transport of intact proteins may be critical in determining the functional consequences of protein absorption.  Aim—(a) To measure the transepithelial transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and to identify the nature of HRP <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> released on the basal side of enterocytes and (b) to assess the role of interferon γ (IFNγ) on HRP transport and processing.  Methods—HT 29 - 19 A intestinal cells {{were used to assess}} transepithelial transport of HRP in Ussing chambers, and the nature of <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> in the basal compartment was analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).  Results—(1) In control conditions, [3 H]HRP equivalent fluxes (3135 (219) ng/h per cm 2; mean (SEM)) comprised 50 % amino acids, 40 % peptides, and 10 % intact HRP. Steric exclusion HPLC of the <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> indicated a wide range of molecular masses including a major peptide of about 1150 Da. Lysosomal aspartyl and thiol proteases were expressed but no HLA-DR surface expression was noted. (2) At 48 to 72 hours after IFNγ stimulation, [3 H]HRP equivalent fluxes increased significantly (7392 (1433) ng/h per cm 2) without modification of the relative proportions of amino acids, peptides, and intact HRP, and without modification of the distribution of <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> in HPLC. Lysosomal protease activities were not modified by IFNγ but HLA-DR expression was increased.  Conclusion—Intestinal cells are able to process HRP into peptides potentially capable of stimulating the immune system. IFNγ stimulates the transport and processing of HRP thus increasing the antigenic load in the intestinal mucosa. ...|$|R
30|$|Superior {{degradation}} of AFB 1 by the Blue P. ostreatus strain {{used in this}} study is similar to the findings of Das et al. (2015) who showed that the wild P. ostreatus strain GHBBF 10 (GenBank accession number KC 987361) had greater AFB 1 -degradation capacity than another strain (MTCC 142) from a culture collection. Results from the mutagenicity assay presented here are in agreement with Wang et al. (2011) and Alberts et al. (2009) who used purified manganese peroxidase from P. sordida, and purified laccase from another white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor, respectively, to degrade AFB 1 in an ex situ experiment and both found that the mutagenicity of <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> were significantly reduced compared to control samples in an enzyme activity-dependent manner. In most cases, the extent that <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> reverted to the parent compound in this study were on par with results from the same assay used on <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> from AFB 1 -contaminated maize that had been subjected to ammoniation (Weng et al. 1994), the most effective and commonly used chemical decontamination technology.

The direct antiglobulin test (DAT, or direct Coombs' test) is negative, as the hemolysis of PNH is not caused by antibodies. If the PNH occurs in the setting of known (or suspected) aplastic anemia, abnormal white blood cell counts and decreased platelet counts may be seen at this. In this case, anemia may be caused by insufficient red blood cell production in addition to the hemolysis.|$|E

40|$|June 2012 Abstract The oilseed crop Limnanthes alba (white meadowfoam) {{is grown}} in Oregon. Methods were {{developed}} {{for the production of}} a liquid-based bioherbicide from meadowfoam seed meal (MSM).

It was discovered that the relative amounts of glucosinolate <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> formed were dependent upon the extraction solvent for MSM, the extraction solvent for seed, and the fermentation matrix.

25|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} is {{identified}} by {{a blood test}} for creatinine, which is a <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> of muscle metabolism. Higher levels of creatinine indicate a lower glomerular filtration rate {{and as a result}} a decreased capability of the kidneys to excrete waste products.

To fully investigate the underlying cause of kidney damage, various forms of medical imaging, blood tests, and sometimes a kidney biopsy (removing a small sample of kidney tissue) are employed to find out if a reversible cause for the kidney malfunction is present.|$|E
