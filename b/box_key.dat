50|$|Team Southie Boys {{were first}} {{to arrive at the}} Library of Congress, {{followed}} by Team Geniuses and Team Air Force in third. Teams were advised to seek one of three specific books (titled Poltroons & Patriots, Official Histories and The American Flag: Of Stars and Stripes) each of which covered the final artifact.
