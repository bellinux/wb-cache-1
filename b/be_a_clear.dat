5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} under Article 15(4) of the Constitution {{restrictions}} {{on the right of}} freedom of religion could be imposed only if public order, public health or morality is affected, and section 24(1)(a) of the SA provides for registered organizations to be dissolved only if they threaten public peace, welfare or good order. The appellants therefore submitted that there had to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> and immediate danger to public order before freedom of religion can be circumscribed. Since the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses posed no such threat, the deregistration order was unconstitutional and ultra vires the SA.|$|E
5|$|Many {{churches in}} the city (including the Church of the Resurrection or Holy Sepulchre) were burned, and {{numerous}} relics, including the True Cross, the Holy Lance, and the Holy Sponge, were carried off to the Persian capital Ctesiphon. The loss of these relics was thought by many Christian Byzantines to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> mark of divine displeasure. Some blamed the Jews for this misfortune and {{for the loss of}} Syria in general. There were reports that Jews helped the Persians capture certain cities and that the Jews tried to slaughter Christians in cities that the Persians had already conquered but were found and foiled from doing so. These reports are likely to be greatly exaggerated and the result of general hysteria.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few days, bad weather {{prevented}} more large attacks. On 9 and 11 September, only smaller raids were carried out. It gave Hugh Dowding AOC (Air Officer Commanding) Fighter Command, the chance to prepare and reinforce his forces. The British, possibly {{through the use of}} Ultra intelligence, recognised the German change in strategy and duly prepared for further attacks on the capital. ULTRA's contribution to the preparations for 15 September is also disputed. The intelligence from ULTRA at this stage in the war tended to be fragmented. With the Germans launching attacks whenever there was clear weather, {{it would not have been}} difficult for RAF Fighter Command to have predicted an attack on 15 September, which was to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> day.|$|E

5|$|The film {{focuses on}} a young heiress who has two suitors, one a French baron and the other an American {{businessman}} named Jack. Her aunt, who favors the French noble out her desire for status, is hurt {{to learn that the}} heiress has chosen to marry the American businessman. The baron vows revenge and schemes with the aunt to aid his plot. When the businessman comes to the house to see his fiancée, he learns that she is {{out of the house and}} sits down with the baron and aunt. Moments later, the servant rushes into the room attracted by cries to see Jack bending over the wounded baron with a knife in hand. Both the aunt and the baron accuse him of the stabbing as well as the servant and a policeman, who also saw Jack with the knife. In court, the jury finds it to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> case and Jack is sentenced to ten years in prison.|$|E

25|$|Although some {{consider}} that the distinction between transpersonal psychology and the psychology of religion, is fading (e.g. The Oxford Handbook of Psychology and Spirituality), there is still generally considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> distinction between the two. Much of the focus of psychology of religion is concerned with issues that wouldn't be considered 'transcendent' within transpersonal psychology, so the two disciplines do have quite a distinct focus.|$|E
25|$|The inquiry also {{recommended}} a registration scheme for people {{working with children}} and vulnerable adults such as the elderly. The development of this recommendation led to {{the foundation of the}} Independent Safeguarding Authority. It also suggested a national system should be set up for police forces to share intelligence information. The report said there should also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> code of practice on record-keeping by all police forces.|$|E

25|$|Aruch HaShulchan (Hebrew: ערוך השולחן) is a chapter-to-chapter {{restatement}} of the Shulchan Aruch (the latter {{being the}} most influential codification of halakhah in the post-Talmudic era). Compiled and written by Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein (1829–1908), the work attempts to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear,</b> organized summary of the sources for each chapter of the Shulchan Aruch and its commentaries, with special emphasis on {{the positions of the}} Jerusalem Talmud and Maimonides.|$|E
25|$|Determinism is a {{property}} characterizing state changes {{due to the}} passage of time, namely that the state at a future instant {{is a function of the}} state in the present (see time evolution). It may not always be clear whether a particular interpretation is deterministic or not, as there may not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> choice of a time parameter. Moreover, a given theory may have two interpretations, one of which is deterministic and the other not.|$|E
25|$|In this example, the v, what {{normally}} binds the pronoun, has all phi features {{bound to}} {{itself from the}} start. Kratzer describes predication as the subject pronoun that eventually becomes a relative pronoun. Predication, in (24) adopts the phi features from v. Kratzer predicts that the merging of DPs to a specifier position would only happen when the DPs are without phi features. In the event that a DP adopts phi features from v from predication, then there should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> distinction.|$|E

25|$|Walking is also {{considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> {{example of a}} sustainable mode of transport, especially suited for urban use and/or relatively shorter distances. Non-motorised transport modes such as walking, but also cycling, small-wheeled transport (skates, skateboards, push scooters and hand carts) or wheelchair travel are often key elements of successfully encouraging clean urban transport. A large variety of case studies and good practices (from European cities and some worldwide examples) that promote and stimulate walking {{as a means of}} transportation in cities can be found at Eltis, Europe's portal for local transport.|$|E
25|$|There must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> {{political}} counter-vision {{that can}} overshadow, match or neutralize the guerrilla vision. This {{can range from}} granting political autonomy, to economic development measures in the affected region. The vision must be an integrated approach, involving political, social and economic and media influence measures. A nationalist narrative for example, might be used in one situation, an ethnic autonomy approach in another. An aggressive media campaign must also be mounted {{in support of the}} competing vision or the counter-insurgent regime will appear weak or incompetent.|$|E
25|$|Between 2007 and 2009, Nicaragua's major {{political}} parties discussed the possibility of going from a presidential system to a parliamentary system. Their reason: there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> differentiation between the head of government (prime minister) {{and the head of}} state (president). Nevertheless, it was later argued that the true reason behind this proposal was to find a legal way for President Ortega to stay in power after January 2012, when his second and last government period was expected to end. Ortega was reelected to a third term in November 2016.|$|E

25|$|George, Walker, Kuter and Hansell {{provided}} the key concepts for the AWPD task force. George's vision {{was that the}} plan {{should not be a}} simple list of quantities of men and materiel—it should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> expression of the strategic direction required to win the war by use of air power. The main feature of the plan was the proposal to use massive fleets of heavy bombers to attack economic targets, the choke points of Axis industry. Hansell, fresh from a fact-finding mission to England in which he was briefed on British appreciations of German industrial and military targets, immediately became immersed in the job of target selection.|$|E
25|$|After Adolf Hitler came {{to power}} on January 30, 1933, he began the {{suppression}} of the Communist Party of Germany. The Nazis took police measures against Soviet trade missions, companies, press representatives, and individual citizens in Germany. They also launched an anti-Soviet propaganda campaign coupled with a lack of good will in diplomatic relations, although the German Foreign Ministry under Konstantin von Neurath (foreign minister from 1932–1938) was vigorously opposed to the impending breakup. The second volume of Hitler's programmatic Mein Kampf (which first appeared in 1926) called for Lebensraum (living space for the German nation) in the east (mentioning Russia specifically), and, in keeping with his world view, portrayed the Communists as Jews (see also Jewish Bolshevism) who were destroying a great nation. This ambition, if implemented, would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> danger to the security of the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|On October 27, 1919, the Lebanese {{delegation}} led by Maronite Patriarch Elias Peter Hoayek {{presented the}} Lebanese aspirations in a memorandum to the Paris Peace Conference. This included a significant {{extension of the}} frontiers of the Lebanon Mutasarrifate, arguing that the additional areas constituted natural parts of Lebanon, {{despite the fact that}} the Christian community would not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> majority in such an enlarged state. The quest for the annexation of agricultural lands in the Bekaa and Akkar was fueled by existential fears following the death of nearly half of the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate population in the Great Famine; the Maronite church and the secular leaders sought a state that could better provide for its people. The areas to be added to the Mutasarrifate included the coastal towns of Beirut, Tripoli, Sidon and Tyre and their respective hinterlands, all of which belonged to the Beirut Vilayet, together with four Kazas of the Syria Vilayet (Baalbek, the Bekaa, Rashaya and Hasbaya).|$|E
