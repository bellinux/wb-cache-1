Describing her role, Collins said [...] "I had to play off all the guys and their testosterone-heavy abilities. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> that the female powers of persuasion easily trump fangs and knives and guns."

500|$|In 1989, with Hughes under public attack, {{a battle}} raged {{in the letters}} pages of The Guardian and The Independent. In The Guardian on April 20, 1989, Hughes wrote the article [...] "The Place Where Sylvia Plath Should Rest in Peace": [...] "In the years soon after [...] death, when {{scholars}} approached me, I tried to take their apparently serious concern for the truth about Sylvia Plath seriously. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> my lesson early. [...] If I tried too hard to tell them exactly how something happened, {{in the hope of}} correcting some fantasy, I was quite likely to be accused of trying to suppress Free Speech. In general, my refusal {{to have anything to do}} with the Plath Fantasia has been regarded as an attempt to suppress Free Speech [...] The Fantasia about Sylvia Plath is more needed than the facts. Where that leaves respect for the truth of her life (and of mine), or for her memory, or for the literary tradition, I do not know." [...] Hughes died in 1998.|$|E
500|$|Even {{though the}} show was set in Miami, filming took place at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Stock {{exterior}} shots of Miami {{were used for the}} opening credits and transitions between scenes. The series was filmed with a multiple-camera setup, with each episode last roughly 20 to 22 minutes excluding commercials. Eve said she was initially intimidated by the amount of work required to prepare for and film a television series. During an interview with Billboard, she explained that while filming the first season she felt like she [...] "just wanted to leave because there was so much to learn, it's just a different world". Since she found comedy to be challenging due to the [...] "certain beats you have to learn", Eve hired two acting coaches to help improve her timing. One of her coaches was Chip Fields, who visited the show's set to offer Eve acting advice. During the development of the second season, Eve viewed the set as her home, and felt the process was easier, having grown closer to the cast and crew. In a 2016 interview with Grazia, she revealed her regret at not fully committing herself to her character and the series. She explained: [...] "I was the youngest person on set and was clubbing in between being on set and learning my lines. I look back and wish I was more dedicated. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> from it." ...|$|E

500|$|Previous {{series of}} Jonathan Creek had {{featured}} first Caroline Quentin, and then Julia Sawalha as Jonathan's assistants Maddy Magellan and Carla Borrego, respectively. Quentin {{departed from the}} show {{at the end of}} its third series in 2000 in order to try for a second child, while Sawalha temporarily retired from acting in 2004, having become so disillusioned that she was [...] "dragging self out of bed" [...] by the end of the show's fourth series in order to film episodes. Davies explained that Renwick had always believed Jonathan needed a sidekick character, and that: [...] "You can't really have Jonathan Creek without his sounding board when all the stuff is going on in his mind. In a novel you can have an interior monologue when a leading character is working out what's going on, but for a film or television you have to have Dr Watson for Sherlock Holmes, it's somebody for Holmes to explain it to." [...] For [...] "The Grinning Man", a new sidekick was created in the form of Joey Ross, played by actress Sheridan Smith. Renwick described the opportunity to work with Smith as a major catalyst in his decision to revive the show. The actress had previously appeared in his series Love Soup, and Renwick's wife suggested pairing her with Davies in the new episode. Smith was approached about the role before the episode's script was written, and after readily agreeing to take the part of Ross, Renwick wrote the character's dialogue with Smith's northern accent in mind. The actress found accustoming herself to [...] "detective talk" [...] the hardest part of the role, explaining: [...] "You slow down, and then speed up at the end. I kept watching Alan and going, 'I can’t do this figuring out talk.' <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> from the master." [...] Smith enjoyed the challenge the role presented, stating: [...] "He's [...] written this feisty little northern character, and I am really honoured because he's such a great writer. I have always played chavs and slappers so I wasn't used to being an intelligent young girl." ...|$|E

The fact that I'm a workaholic, studio in, studio out, stage on, stage off, want {{to be dealing with}} music day and night, doesn't mean everyone else has to adjust to that pace. Alec wanted to quit for a while now, so it didn't come as a complete surprise." ...|$|E

2500|$|Money {{was tight}} {{at the club}} and the club's board was putting {{pressure}} on Rioch to sell Colin Anderson the club's star player {{at the time to}} balance the books, following Rioch claiming [...] "a good few for Anderson could well save the club". Anderson's form nosedived, infuriating Rioch – this culminated in Rioch punching the player in the jaw after Anderson nutmegged him during a five-a-side match in training. Faced with the prospect of Anderson going to the PFA over the matter, the club suggested Rioch resign, which he promptly did. Twenty years later, he said, [...] "What I did was inexcusable. It was a period of my career which I deeply regret, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> from the experience".|$|E
2500|$|On May 9, 1887, Buffalo Bill's Wild West {{opened in}} London. Among the {{audience}} members was Queen Victoria, {{who visited the}} Earl's Court encampment three days later. [...] Black Elk recalled that Natives were told [...] "that Majesty was coming. I {{did not know what}} that was at first, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> afterward. It was Grandmother England who owned Grandmother's Land where we lived awhile after the Wasichus murdered Crazy Horse." [...] Red Shirt expressed his pleasure in meeting the Queen and remarked to her that [...] "I have come many thousands of miles to see you. Now that I have seen you, my heart is glad." [...] The encounter and his words were widely circulated among the press and noted in her diary. Since the death of Prince Albert, her husband, which event had occurred thirty years previous to this [...] "command," [...] the queen had been more than ordinarily seclusive. She seldom appeared before great assemblages of her subjects and her visits to even her parliament were rare. To theatrical performances she never went during that long period of her mourning. Her latest knowledge of the greatest actors and actresses of the time was gained by private performances given, by command, in her court, and these were infrequent. [...] "The Wild West was altogether too big a thing to take to Windsor Castle, and {{as in the case of}} Mahomet and the mountain, as the Wild West could not go to the Queen it became absolutely necessary for the Queen to go to the Wild West, if she desired to see it, and it was evident that she did." [...] "Then I presented Red Shirt, the Native Chieftain, who was gorgeous in war paint and feather trappings. His proud bearing was fetching among the royal party, and when he spoke through an interpreter, saying he had come a long way to see her Majesty and [...] "felt glad," [...] the Queen smiled appreciatively, and as the red man, unconventionally, but proudly, strolled away with the dignity of a Supreme Court Judge, she seemed to say, [...] "I know a real prince when I see him." [...] "Every act went with a rush and a cheer, and was received by cries of 'bravo,' 'well done,' etc. At the close of the exhibition calls were made for Red Shirt and myself, in response to which I thanked my patrons and assured them that the recollection of that evening's display of kindness would ever be fresh in my memory. Cries of 'Bravo, Bill,' and the singing of 'For he's a jolly good fellow' by the entire audience brought the demonstration to a close." ...|$|E
