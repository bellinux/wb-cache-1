5|$|Nansen's {{farthest}} north record {{lasted for}} just over five years. On 24 April 1900 {{a party of}} three from an Italian expedition led by the Duke of the Abruzzi reached 86°34′N, having left Franz Josef Land with dogs and sledges on 11 March. The party <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> it back; one of their support groups of three men vanished entirely.|$|E
5|$|Charlie has <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> it {{into his}} new flat in London when his father dies suddenly. Charlie hurries home for the funeral, where he finds the factory near bankruptcy. The factory makes good quality men's shoes, {{but they are not}} stylish and not cheap, and the market for them is drying up. Charlie is {{determined}} to save the factory and his father's legacy, though he has no desire to run Price & Sons himself. The workers, many of whom have known Charlie his entire life, do not understand why Charlie had moved away in the first place, and many are hostile and skeptical of the new management.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{scored the}} first {{run of the}} game in the third inning on a Babe Ruth solo home run into the right field bleachers. In the {{following}} half inning, the Cardinals came back to take a 3–1 lead over the Yankees. Jim Bottomley lined a one-out single into left field to start the Cardinals' fourth inning rally. Les Bell just <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> it to first base after shortstop Mark Koenig accidentally kicked the ball while trying to field it. With runners at first and second base, Chick Hafey hit a bloop single into left field, which loaded up the bases for catcher Bob O'Farrell. This time, left fielder Bob Meusel made an error by dropping O'Farrell's fly ball, so Bottomley scored to tie the game, and the bases remained loaded. Tommy Thevenow followed with a two-run single to right fielder Ruth. Hoyt struck out the next batter, and Wattie Holm hit into a force play at second base. All three runs in the inning were charged as unearned on Hoyt, due to the two Yankee errors.|$|E
50|$|Ryan Hunter-Reay {{also had}} a crash on lap 20 which saw his car slide into the pit lane. This capped a brutal month of May for the Vision Racing driver, in which his car never seemed {{to get up to}} speed, and he <b>barely</b> even <b>made</b> the 500 field.|$|R

He subsequently signed for the Blades on a year-long loan following a brief trial spell. Despite this move he <b>barely</b> even <b>made</b> the substitutes bench {{during the first half of}} the season, with manager Gary Speed claiming he wasn't ready for English football.|$|R
2500|$|Under Omani Arabs Zanzibar became East Africa's main slave port, {{with as many}} as 50,000 enslaved Africans {{passing through}} every year during the 19th century. Some historians {{estimate}} that between 11 and 18 million African slaves crossed the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Sahara Desert from 650 to 1900 AD. Eduard Rüppell described the losses of Sudanese slaves being transported on foot to Egypt: [...] "after the Daftardar bey's 1822 campaign in the southern Nuba mountains, nearly 40,000 slaves were captured. However, through bad treatment, disease and desert travel <b>barely</b> 5000 <b>made</b> it to Egypt.." ...|$|R
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. In the first part of qualifying (Q1), the session got interrupted shortly after it had started, as Felipe Nasr came to a halt at the exit of the tunnel, caused by an engine failure. A red flag came out while the car was cleared off the track. When the running resumed, all drivers except for the two at Force India went out on the ultrasoft tyres to set their first lap times. Max Verstappen was the last to set a representative time, but touched the guardrail at the swimming pool chicane and crashed into the wall, causing another red flag period. As the session got back under way, it were the two Manor cars of Rio Haryanto and Pascal Wehrlein, as well as Jolyon Palmer and Marcus Ericsson who joined Nasr and Verstappen on the sidelines, as they were eliminated. Kevin Magnussen meanwhile <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> it into Q2, but was under investigation for exiting the pit lane while it was closed.|$|E
5|$|According {{to coach}} McKay, the team’s {{progress}} was set back as {{they spent the}} preseason {{trying to find out}} which veterans would develop into regulars, but found that the younger players were better. This meant that the team started over from the beginning as the regular season began. The tone for the season seemed to be set as the team got lost in the Houston Astrodome when leaving the locker room to take the field for their opening game. They spent 20 minutes trying to find their way out, and <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> it to the field in time for the opening kickoff. The team started out with solid defensive play, ranking in the top 10 until injuries began to set in. They began to wear out as the Buccaneers’ offensive ineptitude meant that the defense {{spent a lot of time}} on the field, over 100 plays in some games. Receiver Johnny McKay pointed out the tendency of the offense to feel pressured after a three-and-out possession, with the result that they would press even harder the next time, quickly going three-and-out again. Coach McKay said early on that controlling the ball for 40 percent of the game, as they were, was not long enough to win. Placekicker Mirro Roder was cut after missing three field goals in the first two games, in both of which the Buccaneers were shut out, giving their offense the nickname “Zero Gang”, which stuck with them through a total of eleven shutouts before their first victory as a franchise.|$|E
5|$|In the 1998 Winter Olympics, curling {{became a}} medal sport {{for the first}} time. Olympic trials were held in November 1997 to select Canada's representatives at the Olympics. The Schmirler rink {{finished}} first in the round robin, and defeated Shannon Kleibrink in the final with a score of 9–6, behind strong shot making from Schmirler and McCusker. Schmirler made a difficult in-off to win and clinch the berth to the Olympics. The 1998 Winter Olympics were held in Nagano, Japan. The Schmirler rink was among the favourites for gold, {{but there was a}} strong field in the event. After finishing the round robin in first place with six wins and one loss, Canada played their semifinal game against Great Britain's Kirsty Hay. The game was tied after regulation play and went to an extra end, where Schmirler <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> a draw with her last rock to win the game. In the final against Denmark's Helena Blach Lavrsen, Schmirler secured a win in nine ends, winning Canada the gold medal. After winning the gold medal, Sandra appeared {{on the front page of}} the New York Times. After the Olympics, the Schmirler rink was named 'Team of the Year' by the Canadian Press. The team were also inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame in 1999. After returning from the Olympics, Schmirler and her rink had to compete almost immediately in the Scott Tournament of Hearts as Team Canada. Schmirler and her team made the playoffs, and won the 3 vs. 4 playoff game before dropping the semifinal to Anne Merklinger. After losing in the semis, Schmirler joined CBC as a colour commentator for the final match.|$|E
50|$|Théodred {{offers the}} Rangers Saeradan and Radanir help in rescuing their captive friends and avenging the betrayal. The player and Rohirrim storm {{the village of}} traitors and rescue many Rangers, {{including}} Halbarad and the sons of Elrond. Yet they are still outnumbered - {{the leader of the}} traitorous clan gloats over Ranger's weaknesses and allows them to leave, telling them to spread the tale of how the Falcon-clan beat them. Of almost 60 named Rangers <b>barely</b> 30 <b>made</b> it out alive: Halbarad takes an oath to avenge the traitors and proclaims himself in eternal debt to Théodred, before planning the next move.|$|R
50|$|Catch-22s budget could {{accommodate}} 17 flyable B-25s, and {{an additional}} non-flyable hulk was acquired in Mexico, <b>made</b> <b>barely</b> ferry-able and flown with landing gear down to the Guaymas, Sonora, Mexico filming location, only to be burned and destroyed in the landing crash scene. The wreck was then buried in the ground next to the runway, where it remains.|$|R
50|$|Speaking of her {{teaching}} career in high school, she always broke from tradition {{and followed her}} own creative approach to her work, like preparing materials {{way out of the}} text books, taking after school lessons and designing unconventional science labs. The results that followed always proved outstanding: one hundred percent students sailed through exams when <b>barely</b> forty percent <b>made</b> it before she taught the class. And this miracle indeed happened in a school at South Bronx, considered one of the poorest congressional districts in New York.|$|R
25|$|At {{the start}} of the season, Coca-Cola {{struggled}} throughout the conference due to its depleted lineup but had its share of surprising wins over Red Bull and Sta. Lucia among others. The Tigers <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> it to the wildcard phase with a 5-13 record.|$|E
25|$|Redskins {{running back}} Stephen Davis rushed for 119 {{yards and two}} touchdowns in the first half as Washington {{dominated}} the Lions, who had <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> the playoffs with an 8–8 record and had lost their last four games of the season.

25|$|Soon after Club Colectiv tragedy, Romania may request {{assistance}} {{through the}} EU Civil Protection Mechanism. However, the request was <b>made</b> <b>barely</b> {{six days after}} fire. So, the European Commission received on 5 November a request from the Romanian Government to transfer in other member states of the European Union or the European Economic Area about 80 patients {{who can not be}} treated in Romania. Interim Prime Minister Sorin Cîmpeanu previously stated that Romania did not request the triggering of the mechanism, because Club Colectiv tragedy would not fit in the formal definition of disasters.|$|R
60|$|Often of {{an evening}} I would {{accompany}} Hal upon his rounds. By the savage tribe he both served and ruled {{he had come to}} be regarded as medicine man and priest combined. He was both their tyrant and their slave, working for them early and late, yet bullying them unmercifully, enforcing his commands sometimes with vehement tongue, and where that would not suffice with quick fists; the counsellor, helper, ruler, literally of thousands. Of income he could have <b>made</b> <b>barely</b> enough to live upon; but few men could have enjoyed more sense of power; and that I think it was that held him to the neighbourhood.|$|R
50|$|For years, {{the works}} <b>made</b> <b>barely</b> {{enough money to}} cover the workmen's wages. Then, in 1841, Alfred's brother Hermann invented the spoon-roller—which Alfred patented, {{bringing}} in enough money to enlarge the factory, steel production, and cast steel blocks. In 1847 Krupp made his first cannon of cast steel. At the Great Exhibition (London) of 1851, he exhibited a 6 pounder made entirely from cast steel, and a solid flawless ingot of steel weighing 4300 lb, {{more than twice as}} much as any previously cast. He surpassed this with a 100000 lb ingot for the Paris Exposition in 1855. Krupp's exhibits caused a sensation in the engineering world, and the Essen works became famous.|$|R
25|$|After the war, Paul Brown {{became the}} {{head coach of the}} Cleveland Browns, a {{professional}} team under formation in the new All-America Football Conference. He invited Young to try out for the squad. Young <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> the team and played sparingly in the Browns' first season in 1946, when the team won the first AAFC championship.|$|E
25|$|The Lightning {{had to wait}} a year {{to defend}} their title due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, but in 2005–06, they <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> the playoffs {{with a record of}} 43–33–6 for 93 points in a conference where six teams notched 100 or more points. They lost to the Ottawa Senators in five games {{in the first round of}} the 2006 playoffs.|$|E
25|$|The Board {{ultimately}} {{ruled that}} Sullenberger {{had made the}} correct decision, reasoning that the checklist for dual-engine failure is designed for higher altitudes, when pilots {{have more time to}} deal with the situation, and that while simulations showed that the plane might have just <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> it back to LaGuardia, those scenarios assumed an instant decision to do so, with no time allowed for assessing the situation.|$|E
2500|$|Egyptian Camel Transport Corps not {{required}} by the fighting troops accompanied the evacuation of the wounded down the Umm Esh Shert track, preparatory to {{the withdrawal of the}} whole force. Camels, slow and sometimes obstinate beasts, <b>made</b> <b>barely</b> [...] an hour moving in single file down the precipitous goat path of Umm esh Shert. Their feet, more suited to sand, were cut and bruised by the sharp stones and slippery rocks of the path. Groaning and protesting, the unwieldy beasts lurched perilously down the track. Every now and then one of them would stop short, blocking the way for those behind it and refuse obstinately to move on. It was past mid-day before the last camel had cleared Es Salt ...|$|R

Herbert Wilcox, who should have known better, launched the projectile, first charging it with people like Jack Buchanan, Elsie Randolph and Antony Holles and detonating it with a slow-burning musical comedy plot about a man with one fiancée too many.

5000|$|After high school, she {{continue}} to throw at Arizona State University {{to work with}} one of the best programs in the country at that point in time. She achieved All American status in both events as a freshman in 1984. ASU alumni Ria Stalman and Leslie Deniz went on to take gold and silver in the discus at the 1984 Olympics. Still <b>barely</b> 18, Kaaiawahia <b>made</b> it to the Olympic Trials at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum just 30 miles (50 km) from Fullerton. Her final throw was estimated to be about 56 feet (over 17 meters), which would have been enough to qualify for the Olympics, but the throw was ruled a foul. The third slot went to another Southern California star Ramona Pagel with a [...] Kaaiawahia's best was [...] in fifth place.|$|R
25|$|After forcing Cleveland to punt on {{the opening}} drive of overtime, Elway led the Broncos 60 yards to set up Karlis' game winning 33-yard field goal. The key play of the drive was a 28-yard {{completion}} to Steve Watson on third down and 12 at midfield. Two carries by Sammy Winder then moved {{the ball to the}} 16-yard line where Karlis made his game winning kick, which <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> it inside the left upright.|$|E
25|$|On August 25, 2009, Griffin {{released}} a second comedy album, Suckin' It for the Holidays, in another {{bid for a}} Grammy.

Despite the album's holiday title, it contains little holiday-related content, and it just <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> the nominations cut-off. On December 2, 2009 it was nominated for Best Comedy Album, making it Griffin's second Grammy nomination.|$|E
25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{ruled that}} Sullenberger made the correct {{decision}} in {{landing on the}} river instead of attempting return to LaGuardia because the normal procedures for engine loss are designed for cruising altitudes, not immediately after takeoff. Simulations showed that Flight 1549 could have <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> it back to LaGuardia had that maneuver begun immediately after the bird strike, but this scenario completely neglects {{the time needed to}} understand what had happened and assess the situation.|$|E
50|$|As was {{the case}} in 1950, the 1958 Giants also beat Cleveland twice during the regular season, 21-17 and 13-10, as the teams tied for first with a 9-3 record. The Browns went into the latter game at 9-2, needing only a victory to clinch the {{division}} crown, and led 7-0 early in the first quarter and 10-3 in the fourth quarter. But Pat Summerall - yes, that Pat Summerall - kicked a 49-yard field goal in a snowstorm to provide the win even though he <b>made</b> <b>barely</b> 50 percent (12-of-23) of his attempts during the regular season. Then in the playoff, Summerall added a 26-yard field goal in a game highlighted by the fact the Giants held Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown to a career-low eight yards rushing on seven carries, and limited the Browns to just 86 yards of total offense.|$|R

She <b>made</b> the top 12 of the Miss Hong Kong 2002 pageant on early July. She performed in a red dress during the talent portion. After 3 weeks, she competed at the Miss Hong Kong pageant, or the final. 2002 was a special year, because it marked the 30th anniversary of the pageant. A new crown was designed for the special winner, and Lam wore it. She beat out favourites like Cerina da Graça, Victoria Jolly, and more. She also bagged 2 side awards, all for the final. They include: Miss International Goodwill and Miss Modern Style. She broke the Miss Photogenic takes all streak (from 1996 to 2001). She {{is also one of the}} two Miss Hong Kong winner from San Francisco. Her successor, Mandy Cho Man Lei was also from San Francisco.|$|R
25|$|On 23 June, Villaret and Vignolo sailed from Limassol, {{with two}} war galleys {{and four other}} vessels, {{carrying}} a force of 35 Knights, six Levantine horsement, and 500 foot soldiers. To them were added some Genoese ships. The expedition first put in at Kastellorizo, whence Vignolo went ahead to reconnoitre Rhodes. The locals were warned, however, by a Greek serving the Order, and Vignolo <b>barely</b> escaped and <b>made</b> it back to rendezvous with Villaret. In the meantime, two Knights with fifty men had captured the castle of Kos, but were evicted again by Byzantine reinforcements. The allies then sailed to Rhodes. The chronicles of Amadi and Bustron provide the most detailed account of subsequent events: a first assault on the city of Rhodes by land and sea failed, but on 20 September, the Hospitallers captured the (probably deserted) Feraklos Castle on the island's eastern coast. Five days later they launched another unsuccessful attack on the city, which resisted until November. On 11 November, they took the citadel of Filerimos (ancient Ialysos) through the treason of a local Greek; the garrison of 300 Turks was massacred.|$|R
25|$|Junoon {{were not}} an over night success, {{the band members}} {{struggled}} {{for the first few}} years.

Batting with Peter Willey he scored 145 in a fourth wicket stand of 370 against Somerset at Northampton, which remains the county record for a fourth wicket partnership.

Wes Unseld retired and Elvin Hayes was traded to the Houston Rockets the following season.|$|E
60|$|It was {{absolutely}} necessary, however, to decide at once {{where she was}} to sleep. All the rooms in the tower were of stone--dark, gloomy, and cold even in the summer-time. Impossible {{to put her in}} any one of them. The only other alternative was to lodge her in the little modern lean-to, which I have already described as being tacked on {{to the side of the}} old building. It contained three cottage-rooms, and they might be <b>made</b> <b>barely</b> habitable for a young lady. But then those rooms were occupied by Morgan. His books were in one, his bed was in another, his pipes and general lumber were in the third. Could I expect him, after the sour similitudes he had used in reference to our expected visitor, to turn out of his habitation and disarrange all his habits for her convenience? The bare idea of proposing the thing to him seemed ridiculous; and yet inexorable necessity left me no choice but to make the hopeless experiment. I walked back to the tower hastily and desperately, to face the worst that might happen before my courage cooled altogether.|$|R
