The album was supported by The Hell Not Hallelujah Tour, which was interspersed with two co-headlining tours: The End Times with The Smashing Pumpkins, and a summer 2016 tour with Slipknot.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, at the 30 Rock studios, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), {{is shocked}} when NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) gets more laughs {{than he does}} in the elevator, {{compelling}} {{him to go to}} Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) for help. The same thing happens to Jenna and in retaliation, she starts singing [...] "Wind <b>Beneath</b> <b>My</b> Wings", prompting Kenneth to start singing [...] "99 Bottles of Beer", to which everyone in the elevator joins in. As revenge for upstaging them, Tracy and Jenna start doing his page duties which confuses Kenneth. After Tracy explains what Kenneth was doing, Kenneth feels terrible about it and swears never to upstage them again.|$|E
500|$|The two directors, Buck and Lee, {{were also}} {{impressed}} by how Kristen and Idina related. [...] "During {{one of our}} early read-throughs, Kristen and Idina sang a ballad to each other which had so much emotion {{that everyone in the}} room was in tears," [...] Buck said. [...] "It not only showed how great their voices were together, but showed the power the music would have in the story." [...] However, Bell wasn't all confidence when recording with Menzel, described the experiences working with her co-star as [...] "nerve-racking". The duo had rehearsed at Idina's house a song called [...] "Wind <b>Beneath</b> <b>My</b> Wings", in which Bell greatly commended Idina's powerful voice. Regarding the songs that she performed in the film, Kristen said, [...] "We're singing the lovely songs of Kristen and Bobby Lopez, who wrote 'Book of Mormon.' So it's really, really funny music. It's really good music. They're amazing to work for." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{standard}} {{version of the}} album contains ten tracks and the deluxe edition adds three acoustic versions as bonus tracks. Editions of the album sold at Walmart stores in North America feature a censored version of [...] "The Devil <b>Beneath</b> <b>My</b> Feet". Manson later criticized the store and its gun sales policy, categorizing Walmart in an Australian interview as [...] "that store in America which sells guns to kids but won't sell R-rated lyrics." [...] Manson went on to joke that he might [...] "do a signing at a Walmart store where I just sign guns, {{and you get a}} free record with it when you buy a gun." [...] American CD versions of the album were packaged with black polycarbonate discs identical to those used by Sony for the original PlayStation in the early 1990s; the discs were sourced by Brian Schuman of Concord Music from the same plant Sony used. A heat-sensitive thermal texture was added to the CD, so that it appeared black when first opened but revealed a white pattern when exposed to the heat from a CD player.|$|E
500|$|... "Saturdays of Thunder" [...] {{features}} {{a number of}} references to popular culture. The title of the episode is itself a play on the film Days of Thunder, starring American actor Tom Cruise. The song used {{at the end of}} the episode is [...] "Wind <b>Beneath</b> <b>My</b> Wings", a song by Bette Midler. While Homer is watching television at the beginning of the episode, Marge and her sisters, Patty and Selma, go through a catalog of different hairstyles; Patty tells her sisters that she wants Mary Tyler Moore's hairstyle, referencing the American actress known for her roles in television sitcoms. When Marge and her sisters head to the beauty parlor, Homer promises Marge that he will take Lisa to the video store. When they arrive at the store, Homer watches a clip from the latest McBain film that sees McBain's partner being brutally shot in the chest, a reference to a similar scene in the film Lethal Weapon. McBain's partner is black, a reference to the fact that Dirty Harry's partner is black in the film Sudden Impact.|$|E
500|$|... "Under Your Spell" [...] {{received}} attention from Buffy studies writers because {{it presents a}} frank and unflinching expression of lesbian romance. Buffy the Vampire Slayer was the first show in U.S. television history to portray a long-term lesbian relationship among the core cast of characters. Previous televised depictions of lesbian relations were primarily limited to single [...] "coming out" [...] or [...] "lesbian kiss" [...] episodes, showing lesbian-identified characters as affectionate but not erotic. Tara and Willow demonstrate throughout the series, and specifically in [...] "Once More, with Feeling", that they are [...] "intensely sexual", according to Buffy essayist Justine Larbalestier. Near the end of Tara's song, she sings, [...] "Lost in ecstasy / Spread <b>beneath</b> <b>my</b> Willow tree / You make me / Com — plete", as Tara levitates off the bed while Willow tacitly performs cunnilingus on her. Lorna Jowett called the song [...] "the most erotic scene" [...] of the series. Whedon admitted on the DVD commentary for the episode that the song is [...] "pornography" [...] and [...] "probably the dirtiest lyric I've ever written, but also very, very beautiful".|$|E

500|$|Critics {{considered}} [...] "Subtle Invitation" [...] {{to be one}} of the album's strongest songs {{because of}} its [...] "well executed" [...] jazz influence. The song begins with the sounds of people dining, then introduces the strong bassline and drums. Towards the end of the song, Carey belts out the climax. Sarah Rodman from The Boston Herald described it as fascinating and wrote, [...] "it sounds as though Carey is singing in falsetto while still in her chest voice." [...] "Clown" [...] drew strong media attention, and its lyrical content led critics to speculate that Carey aimed it at rapper Eminem, who had publicly announced that he had had a relationship with Carey. Rodman said [...] "Clown" [...] was [...] "languidly sinister", with lyrics such as, [...] "I should've left it at 'I like your music too'...You should never have intimated we were lovers / when you know very well we never even touched each other." [...] Critics compared [...] "I Only Wanted" [...] with [...] "My All"s instrumentation and structure of verse, chorus and guitar solo. According to Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine, Carey makes vague allusions to her ex-husband Tommy Mottola with the line, [...] "Wish I'd stayed <b>beneath</b> <b>my</b> veil". The song uses Latin-inspired guitar instrumentation and wind sounds as an additional backbone to the melody, and dripping water as its percussion.|$|E
500|$|Idina Menzel, a Broadway veteran, {{was cast}} as Elsa. Menzel had {{formerly}} auditioned for Tangled, {{but did not}} get the part. However, Tangleds casting director, Jamie Sparer Roberts, preserved a recording of Menzel's performance on her iPhone, and on the basis of that, asked her to audition along with Bell for Frozen. Before they were officially cast, Menzel and Bell deeply impressed the directors and producers at an early table read; after reading the entire script out loud, they sang [...] "Wind <b>Beneath</b> <b>My</b> Wings" [...] together as a duet, since no music had been composed yet. Bell had suggested that idea when she visited Menzel at her California home to prepare together for the table read. The songwriters were also present for the table read; Anderson-Lopez said [...] "Lasseter was in heaven" [...] upon hearing Menzel and Bell sing in harmony, and from that moment forward, he insisted, [...] "Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel {{have to be in the}} movie!" [...] Lee said, [...] "They sung [...] it like sisters and what you mean to me nd there wasn't a dry eye in the house after they sang." [...] Between December 2012 and June 2013, the casting of additional roles was announced, including Jonathan Groff as Kristoff, Alan Tudyk as the Duke of Weselton, Santino Fontana as Prince Hans, and Josh Gad as Olaf.|$|E
500|$|During production, Menzel and Jonathan Groff, who portrays Kristoff, {{went to the}} {{animation}} studio {{to explain to the}} animators how they were approaching their characters. Animators asked Menzel questions about her singing, observed how she breathed as she sang live, and made videorecordings of her recording sessions; they then animated Elsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing, for further realism. [...] Her voice supplied inspiration for Elsa's most prominent song, [...] "Let It Go". According to composer Robert Lopez, Menzel's vocal range was able to clearly convey Elsa's [...] "low, vulnerable, fragile side" [...] as well as her power and self-realization. Menzel commented that it was [...] "an honor" [...] to have the song and that she enjoyed recording it. [...] "It's a collision of a bunch of forces that are all coming together in the right way," [...] she explained. [...] "The character, what she is singing and what she is experiencing; beautiful lyrics, beautiful melody {{and a little bit of}} me." [...] Buck and Lee were also surprised by how compatible Menzel and Kristen Bell's voices were. At one point during a table read, they sang a ballad (later revealed as [...] "Wind <b>Beneath</b> <b>My</b> Wings") back and forth to one another with so much sentiment that it reportedly left everyone who was present with tears in their eyes. Subsequently, Lee wanted Menzel and Bell to be in the same room when they were recording the important emotional scenes of the film.|$|E

2500|$|Since 1970, Midler has {{released}} 14 studio albums {{as a solo}} artist.
