In this paper, we test whether foreign <b>bank</b> <b>assets</b> {{change as a}} result of domestic and foreign macroeconomic shocks.

40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis has shown how interconnected {{the financial world}} has become. Shocks in one location or asset class can have a sizable impact on the stability of institutions and markets around the world. But systemic risk analysis is severely hampered {{by the lack of}} consistent data that capture the international dimensions of finance. While currently available data can be used more effectively, supervisors and other agencies need more and better data to construct even rudimentary measures of risks in the international financial system. Similarly, market participants need better information on aggregate positions and linkages to appropriately monitor and price risks. Ongoing initiatives that will help in closing data gaps include the G 20 Data Gaps Initiative, which recommends the collection of consistent bank-level data for joint analyses and enhancements to existing sets of aggregate statistics, and the enhancement to the BIS international banking statistics.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} banks use {{accounting}} discretion to overstate {{the value of}} distressed assets. Banks'' balance sheets overvalue real estate-related assets compared to {{the market value of}} these assets, especially during the U. S. mortgage crisis. Share prices of banks with large exposure to mortgage-backed securities also react favorably to recent changes in accounting rules that relax fair-value accounting, and these banks provision less for bad loans. Furthermore, distressed banks use discretion in the classification of mortgage-backed securities to inflate their books.
