They were joined by six non-SIAA members: North Carolina, North Carolina State, Virginia, Virginia Tech, Washington & Lee, and Maryland.

5|$|Sejmiks were {{significantly}} reformed by the Prawo o sejmikach, the act on regional sejms, passed on 24 March 1791 and subsequently recognized {{as part of}} the Constitution of 3 May. This law introduced major changes to the electoral ordinance, as it reduced the enfranchisement of the noble class. The voting right became tied to a property qualification; to <b>be</b> <b>eligible</b> <b>to</b> vote, a noble had to own or lease land and pay taxes, or be closely related to another who did. Some 300,000 out of 700,000 otherwise eligible nobles were thus disfranchised, much to their displeasure. A document from 1792 lists only 47 sejmiks.|$|E
