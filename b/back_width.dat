The purpose of this research is to investigate the anthropometric measurements and body motions of mentally handicapped teenagers in Hong Kong so as to provide a conceptual framework for product development of their clothing. The results indicated that about one-third of the mentally handicapped teenagers were obese and this could affect their behavioral development as well as level of social acceptance. The anthropometric measurements of the mentally handicapped group also differed markedly from those of the ordinary group. A large range of anthropometric variations was observed within the mentally handicapped group.

A questionnaire survey on consumers investigated satisfaction with jackets according to clothing materials and repair trend after wearing. Subsequently, a preference for cir-cular knitted jackets was shown higher than woven jackets. Females in their 20 s preferred woven jackets than those in their 30 s; however, the latter preferred circular knitted jackets than the former. For woven jackets, they showed the high-est satisfaction with size; however, for circular knitted jackets, they showed the highest satisfaction with fitting. In the question on their satisfaction by jacket part, satisfaction with circular knitted jackets was higher in all items except for bust measurement, bottom edge measurement, elbow circumference, shoulder width, and clothes length. Circular knitted jackets had lower repair rates than woven jackets and woven jackets had significant differences by age in satisfaction with <b>back</b> <b>width.</b> The research results indicate that females in their 20 s and 30 s who value fit preference and practicality will increasingly wear knit clothes.

As shape factors of the weld bead, the bead <b>width,</b> <b>back</b> bead <b>width,</b> and bead cross-section area were measured. According to the weld quality and defined objective functions, the wire feed speed was optimized for various welding speeds. Findings: The wire feed speed that induces the optimum weld quality was found with welding speeds of 0. 5 m/min, 1. 0 m/min, and 1. 5 m/min. The optimum lap welding conditions were then suggested for 1. 6 mm aluminium alloy considering the productivity and quality. Research limitations/implications: The optimization will be extended to various aluminium alloys and the optimized results will be stored in the Al welding database of the intelligent welding power source development. Practical implications: With the increase of the welding speed for aluminium sheet welding, the corresponding wire feed speed should increase as well.

An understanding and clear {{descriptions of the}} human body in motion is important to achieve good fit of garments (Bye et al, 2006; Gill, 2009). However, to date there is still limited research on measuring the dynamic body and its application to clothing, and no previous studies have focused on measuring the dynamic body across body sizes. The purpose of the research was to explore the research method to examine body measurements using the motion capture system. This study tested the accuracy and reliability of a motion capture system in measuring a human body in comparison to the 3 D body scanner. The second purpose was to investigate the body measurement changes in motion and to examine the measurement changes in motion across body sizes. The exploratory research was developed based on the framework for micro and macro levels of fit. The methods for this study were developed to examine body measurements using a motion capture system. The upper body movements in relation to the shoulder girdle were selected for a motion test for this study. The selected motions were the arm rotation and golf swing. Measurements were selected based on their application to pattern development. A total of the 25 women participated in this study. All of them participated in the golf swing test; six were the golf team members and 19 were novices. Of the 25 participants, 19 participated in the arm rotation test. Markers, needed for the optical motion tracking system, were placed at locations on the body corresponding to the selected measurements. Once the markers were attached, the participants were scanned in a natural and relaxed posture using the body scanner, and then their movements were recorded three times using a motion capture system. The quantitative data from the body scanner and motion capture system were analyzed using descriptive statistics, a paired t-test, and an independent t-test. Descriptive analysis of the body measurement change in the two different motion tests in this study indicated that upper body measurements increased or decreased corresponding to the shoulder joint and scapula movement. The shoulder and back arc at the armpit showed the greatest measurement change. The back arc at the armpit increased the most, while the shoulder width decreased the most in the upper body during the motion that involved the arm and torso movement. When the participants performed the arm rotation motion, the shoulder width (- 38. 45 %), <b>back</b> <b>width</b> (16. 08 %), and back arc at the armpit (27. 69 %) showed the most change. The locations that changed measurements the most were the same as the results from the golf swing test. When the participants performed the golf swing motion, the shoulder width (- 14. 47 %), <b>back</b> <b>width</b> (15. 58 %), and back arc at the armpit (20. 65 %) changed the most. An independent t-test indicated that the measurement changes in the golf swing test were different between the novice and expert golfers due to their golf swing poses. There was {{a significant difference in the}} decreases of the shoulder width, and the increases of the lower back arc, right side length, and left diagonal on the back of the body. The results of this study suggest that the measurement changes and percent changes increased as body size increased in two different motion tests. This study suggests that the motion capture system can be successfully used as a body measurement method. The motion capture system can be a reliable method to collect body measurements and to examine the body measurement changes in motion. The motion capture system allowed considering variations in continuous movements among individuals across sizes for dynamic anthropometric studies...|$|E

Transverse occlusion relation, the frequency of crossbite, and the intensity of nasal respiration were measured in all three groups of patients. Results. The obtained results have shown that in the patients with adenoidal enlargement and oral respiration, there was an evidence of maxillary width reduction as opposed to mandibular width. Of the patients, 14 % were with unilateral or bilateral crossbite. In the patients with adenoidectomy done 5 or more years before, transverse maxillary growth compared to mandibular one in the region of the front width, showed statistically significant increase (p < 0. 05) as opposed to the patients with adenoidal enlargement. The effect of adenoidectomy on transverse maxillary growth was not satisfactory anyway, which was also indicated by the increase of frequency of crossbite in 24 % of the patients with adenoidectomy done 5 or more years before.

Two groups of pigs were produced by inseminating LW sows with either stored, frozen semen from 17 LW boars born in 1977 or with semen from 23 LW boars born in 1998. In each group, 15 males and 90 females were randomly chosen and mated to produce approximately 1, 000 pigs/group. These pigs were performance tested with individual ADFI and serial BW and backfat thickness measurements, slaughtered at 105 kg of BW, and measured for carcass traits. The {{data were analyzed}} using mixed linear animal models, including the fixed effect of the experimental group (offspring of 1977 or 1998 boars), the random effect of the additive genetic value of each animal, and, when significant, the fixed effects of sex, fattening batch, and slaughterhouse, the linear regression on BW, and the random effect of the common environment of birth litter. For each trait, the genetic trend was estimated as twice the difference between the 2 experimental groups. Results showed moderately favorable trends for on-test ADG (3. 7 +/- 1. 3 g/d per year) and feed conversion ratio (- 0. 014 +/- 0. 005 kg/kg per year) in spite of a tendency toward an increase in ADFI (7. 6 +/- 4. 7 g/yr). A strong reduction in carcass fatness (- 0. 35 +/- 0. 07 mm/yr for carcass average backfat thickness) and a large improvement in carcass leanness (0. 31 +/- 0. 10 mm(2) /yr and 0. 41 perpendicular to 0. 08 %/yr for loin eye area and carcass muscle content, respectively) were observed. Carcass shape measurements (back and leg length, <b>back</b> <b>width,</b> muscle thickness of hind limbs) were not affected by selection.

Also among all the induction generator configurations for wind power systems the use of Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) configuration with back to <b>back</b> pulse <b>width</b> modulated voltage source converters (VSC) {{is one of the}} best topologies available and it is suitable for both grid connected systems as well as stand-alone systems. Here only stand-alone {{application of}} DFIG is considered. In this thesis mathematical modelling of doubly fed induction machine is presented. The control strategies for both stator side converter and rotor side converter are developed in stator flux oriented reference frame. The dynamics of dc link voltage build-up phase is also included. The stator side converter is used to control the output voltage in direct voltage control manner and the rotor side converter is current controlled where the power imbalance of the system is nullified using dc link voltage controller which modifies the quadrature axis rotor current reference value according to the changes in the wind speed as well as the load. Two control algorithms are presented out of which one gives the best performance for all kinds of loads (balance, unbalance, linear and non-linear) and the other gives poor load regulation and unwanted distortions in the output voltage for non-linear and unbalanced load...|$|R
40|$|Anthropometry data realy {{important}} towards learning facilities design. Comfortness {{and functional}} of table an chair have correlation with physical {{structure of the}} user. Many study for 6 - 18 years old in anthropometry data, but for 4 - 6 years old children there’s no specific anthropometry data. in this research, anthropometry data for 4 - 6 years old child were analyze and applied to the school facilities design. 550 children from 50 schools in East Java were measured, they consist of 259 girls and 291 boys. Average weight of the boys is 21. 40 kg with 9. 23 standard deviation; the girls average weight is 19, 91 kg with 5. 5 standard deviation. From the body dimension gathered from this research could be applied in desigining learning facilities, such as computer table and chair. Another body dimension also used to determine seat’s <b>width,</b> <b>back</b> support’s height, etc, considering the percentile which is appropriate for each adjustment...|$|R
40|$|Liquid phase {{crystallization}} {{of silicon}} LPC Si on glass is a promising method to produce high quality multi crystalline Si films with macroscopic grains. In this study, {{we report on}} recent improvements of our interdigitated back contact silicon heterojunction contact system IBC SHJ, which enabled open circuit voltages as high as 661 mV and efficiencies up to 14. 2 using a 13 m thin n type LPC Si absorbers on glass. The influence of the BSF width on the cell performance is investigated both experimentally and numerically. We combine 1 D optical simulations using GenPro 4 and 2 D electrical simulations using Sentaurus TCAD to determine the optical and electrical loss mechanisms in order to estimate the potential of our current LPC Si absorbers. The simulations reveal an effective minority carrier diffusion length of 26 m and further demonstrate that a doping concentration of 4 1016 cm 3 and a <b>back</b> surface field <b>width</b> of 60 m are optimum values to further increase cell efficiencie...|$|R
5000|$|The tail {{measures}} around 1.5 {{times as}} long as the disc and is relatively broad and flattened at the base. One, rarely two serrated stinging spines are dorsally placed about a third of a disc <b>width</b> <b>back</b> from the tail base. Beyond the sting, the tail becomes thin and whip-like, bearing a long, low ventral fin fold and a much shorter dorsal ridge. There is a short row of closely spaced, spear-shaped thorns along the midline of the back, starting behind the head; 1 - 2 small, seed-shaped thorns are also present on each [...] "shoulder". This species is a plain ochre to dark grayish brown above, becoming lighter towards the disc margins, on the thorns, and past the sting, and white below. Reaching 51 cm across and 1.1 m long, the dwarf black stingray is less than a third as wide as the 1.8 m wide black stingray. The two species also differ in denticle coverage and meristic counts.|$|R
40|$|Even {{though a}} Han-bok, or {{traditional}} Korean costume, should be inherited {{since it is}} invaluable part of our culture, research on Han-bok is scarce. Since {{the development of a}} Jeogori pattern, the upper garment of Korean traditional clothes, is done mostly based on the chest size, the design does not completely consider on wearer’s body shape. Moreover, unless made by an expert, trial and error is almost always necessary to improve the fit of the clothes. In this research, a Jeogori pattern was suggested that improves the fit based on the shape of the upper back(straight or bent) of a female in her late 20 s who often wears a Han-bok and is comfortable when moving. Using a 3 D virtual clothing system, the optimum pattern was selected based on the body shape. The final selection was made, and each subjects tried the garment on to evaluate the comfort when moving, along with its appearance, based on a seven point Likert scale. As a result, for a straight body shape, the optimum ease for the front bust width was 2. 5 cm, and that for the <b>back</b> bust <b>width</b> was 2. 0 cm. The optimum center back dart was 1. 0 cm. The optimum Geodae width was 7. 6 cm, and the optimum back Geodae point was 2. 0 cm. For the bent body shape, the optimum ease for the front and back bust was 2. 0 cm. The optimum Geodae width was 8. 4 cm, and the optimum back Geodae point was 1. 5 cm. Furthermore, if the Hwajang slope was set at half of the vertical distance between the laterals of the neck and shoulder, a fitted silhouette appeared, which is preferred nowadays. In the appearance evaluation, the final pattern designed in this researc...|$|R
50|$|The pelvic fins {{are short}} and broad. The very thin tail {{measures}} 2.6 - 3.4 {{times as long}} as the body, and lacks fin folds. One or two stinging tail spines are placed on the upper surface of the tail, about one-third of a disc <b>width</b> <b>back</b> from the tail base. A wide band of flattened dermal denticles, composed of larger heart-shaped denticles and smaller variably-shaped interstitial denticles, runs along the dorsal surface of the disc from before the eyes to the tail. Small, sharp denticles are scattered over the snout and concentrated at the tip. The tail past the sting is uniformly covered by denticles. The lateral line network is well-developed both over and beneath the disc. Smaller rays are plain greenish gray above, while larger rays are yellowish brown; the tail is uniformly brown and lighter in front of the sting. The underside is distinctively bright yellow, with a thin dark border around the disc margin and sometimes darker blotches around the nostrils, mouth, and gill slits. The largest known male is 71 cm across, and the largest female 65 cm across.|$|R
