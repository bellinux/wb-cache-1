His postulation of embryonic development coincides with his understanding of evolution as a developmental process. [...] In and around 1800, embryology fused with comparative anatomy as the primary foundation of morphology. Ernst Haeckel, along with Karl von Baer and Wilhelm His, are primarily influential in forming the preliminary foundations of ‘phylogenetic embryology’ based on principles of evolution. [...] Haeckel’s ‘Biogenetic Law’ portrays the parallel relationship between an embryo’s development and phylogenetic history. The term, ‘recapitulation,’ has come to embody Haeckel’s <b>Biogenetic</b> <b>Law,</b> for embryonic development is a recapitulation of evolution. [...] Haeckel proposes that all classes of vertebrates pass through an evolutionarily conserved “phylotypic” stage of development, a period of reduced phenotypic diversity among higher embryos. [...] Only in later development do particular differences appear. Haeckel portrays a concrete demonstration of his <b>Biogenetic</b> <b>Law</b> through his ‘Gastrea’ theory, in which {{he argues that the}} early cup-shaped gastrula stage of development is a universal feature of multi-celled animals. An ancestral form existed, known as the gastrea, which was a common ancestor to the corresponding gastrula.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{acceptance}} of Haeckel's <b>Biogenetic</b> <b>Law,</b> despite current rejection of Haeckelian views, finds {{support in the}} certain degree of parallelism between ontogeny and phylogeny. A. M. Khazen, on the one hand, states that [...] "ontogeny is obliged to repeat the main stages of phylogeny." [...] A. S. Rautian, on the other hand, argues that the reproduction of ancestral patterns of development is a key aspect of certain biological systems. Dr. Rolf Siewing acknowledges the similarity of embryos in different species, along with the laws of von Baer, but {{does not believe that}} one should compare embryos with adult stages of development. [...] According to M. S.

Holland, in Walter Garstang: a Retrospective (Theory in Biosciences 130: 247-258, 2011) summarizes Garstang’s more important publications with special attention to his evolutionary thoughts—their source, their relation to the biology of his times, and their fate in the twenty-first century.|$|E
5000|$|The {{theory of}} recapitulation, {{also called the}} <b>biogenetic</b> <b>law</b> or embryological parallelism—often {{expressed}} using Ernst Haeckel's phrase [...] "ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"—is a hypothesis {{that the development of}} the embryo of an animal, from fertilization to gestation or hatching (ontogeny), goes through stages resembling or representing successive stages {{in the evolution of the}} animal's remote ancestors (phylogeny). Since embryos also evolve in different ways, the theory of recapitulation is seen as an historical side-note, rather than as dogma in the field of developmental biology.|$|E

A recent review concluded that the [...] "biogenetic law is supported by several recent studies - if applied to single characters only".|$|E
50|$|Haeckel’s {{illustrations}} show vertebrate embryos {{at different}} stages of development, which exhibit embryonic resemblance as support for evolution, recapitulation as evidence of the <b>Biogenetic</b> <b>Law,</b> and phenotypic divergence as evidence of von Baer’s laws.

In determining the relationships between [...] "phylogenetic linkages" [...] and [...] "evolutionary laws of form," [...] both Gegenbaur and Haeckel relied on a method of comparison. [...] As Gegenbaur argued, the task of comparative anatomy lies in explaining the form and organization of the animal body {{in order to provide}} evidence for the continuity and evolution of a series of organs in the body. Haeckel then provided a means of pursuing this aim with his <b>biogenetic</b> <b>law,</b> in which he proposed to compare an individual's various stages of development with its ancestral line. Although Haeckel stressed comparative embryology and Gegenbaur promoted the comparison of adult structures, both believed that the two methods could work in conjunction to produce the goal of evolutionary morphology.|$|E

40|$|One of the central, {{unresolved}} controversies {{in biology}} concerns {{the distribution of}} primitive versus advanced characters {{at different stages of}} vertebrate development. This controversy has major implications for evolutionary developmental biology and phylogenetics. Ernst Haeckel addressed the issue with his <b>Biogenetic</b> <b>Law,</b> and his embryo drawings functioned as supporting data. We re-examine Haeckel’s work and its significance for modern efforts to develop a rigorous comparative framework for developmental studies. Haeckel’s comparative embryology was evolutionary but non-quantitative. It was based on developmental sequences, and treated heterochrony as a sequence change. It is not always clear whether he believed in recapitulation of single characters or entire stages. The <b>Biogenetic</b> <b>Law</b> is supported by several recent studies – if applied to single characters only. Haeckel’s important but overlooked alphabetical analogy of evolution and development is an advance on von Baer. Haeckel recognized the evolutionary diversity in early embryonic stages, in line with modern thinking. He did not necessarily advocate the strict form of recapitulation and terminal addition commonly attributed to him. Haeckel’s much-criticized embryo drawings are important as phylogenetic hypotheses, teaching aids, and evidence for evolution. While some criticisms of the drawings are legitimate, others are more tendentious. In opposition to Haeckel and hi...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{chordates}} {{arose from the}} alliance between embryology and evolution {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century, as a result of a theoretical elaboration on Kowalevsky’s discoveries about some fundamental similarities between the ontogeny of the lancelet, a putative primitive fish, and that of ascidians, then classified as molluscs. Carrying out his embryological studies in the light of Darwin’s theory and von Baer’s account of the germ layers, Kowalevsky was influenced by the German tradition of idealistic morphology that was concerned with transformations driven by laws of form, rather than with a gradual evolution occurring by means of variation, selection and adaptation. In agreement with this tradition, Kowalevsky interpreted the vertebrate-like structures of the ascidian larva according to von Ko¨lliker’s model of heterogeneous generation. Then, he asserted the homology of the germ layers and their derivatives in different types of animals and suggested a common descent of annelids and vertebrates, in agreement with Saint-Hilaire’s hypothesis of the unity of composition of body plans, but in contrast with Haeckel’s idea of the Chordonia (chordates). In The Descent of Man Darwin quoted Kowalevsky’s discoveries, but accepted Haeckel’s interpretation of the ascidian embryology within the frame of a monophyletic tree of life that was produced by the fundamental <b>biogenetic</b> <b>law.</b> Joining embryology to evolution in the light of idealistic morphology, the <b>biogenetic</b> <b>law</b> turned out to be instrumental in bringing forth different evolutionary hypotheses: it was used by Haeckel and Darwin to link vertebrates to invertebrates by means of the concept of chordates, and by Kowalevsky to corroborate the annelid theory of the origin of vertebrates. Yet, there was still another interpretation of Kowalevsky’s discoveries. As an adherent to empiricism and to Cuvier’s theory of types, von Baer asserted that these discoveries did not prove convincingly a dorsal position of the nervous system in the ascidian tadpole larva; hence, they could not support a homology between different animal types suggesting a kinship between ascidians and vertebrates...|$|E

The elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm with the adapted jumping gene operator (NSGA-II-aJG) is one such evolutionary technique inspired by genetics.

40|$|The {{teaching}} of {{evolution in the}} Portuguese secondary schools is not yet fully understood. This research aimed to contribute to this clarification, {{in the framework of}} the history of the curriculum and the biology subject, by showing the expressions of the evolutionism teaching in the first three decades of the twentieth century. To this end we analyzed the programs of Zoology of 1905 and 1919, as well as two textbooks, entitled «Lições de Zoologia» and written by Bernardo Aires in accordance with these programs. This analysis showed that the study of evolution, eliminated from the program in 1905, was again recognized in the program in 1919. In textbooks, the exposure of evolution focused on the subject of evolution, in the grounds of competition and natural selection, adaptation, the <b>biogenetic</b> <b>law</b> and the essential differences between Lamarckism and Darwinism.

Phylogenetic comparisons and the <b>biogenetic</b> <b>law</b> are applied to deduce behavioural homology. Linyphia webs were constructed gradually and in segments over a period of many days and had a long lifespan. Two construction behaviours, supporting structure and sticky thread (ST) (within the sheet) were observed. ST construction behaviour in linyphiids is considered homologous to sticky spiral construction in orb-weavers. Overall web construction conformed to the pattern of alternate construction of sticky and nonsticky parts as observed in theridiids. Linyphiids had no problem in switching between structure construction and ST construction even during a single behavioural bout. Both web construction behaviours in linyphiids were nonstereotypic, which is unusual in orbicularians. This might be due to the loss of control mechanisms at genetic level, probably by macro mutation. Lack of stereotypic behaviour might have played a substantial role in the origin of the diverse web forms seen in nonorb-weaving orbicularians. This hypothesis is consistent with patterns observed in the orbicularian phylogeny...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{the author}} {{attempts}} to clarify "childhood as the prehistory of human" {{in the dispute}} of Freud and Jung, which {{was a part of}} the "psychoanalytic child", but which forms no part of today's child or childhood. Why did Freud emphasize "sex"? The answer according to the author for this question is because he based his theory on the <b>biogenetic</b> <b>law</b> of E. Haeckel and W. Boelche. Both Freud and Jung relied upon the recapitulation theory of Haeckel and applied it in their psychological ideas. Therefore, for them, "the prehistory of human" was identified with "childhood". However, a different attitude towards biology caused Freud and Jung's theories to diverge. For Freud, some (traumatic) experience not only in individual infancy but also in the prehistory of human had etiological significance in reality. But for Jung, neither the individual infancy nor the prehistory of human had any value outside of fantasy. Post Freud, psychoanalysis has shifted to focus to understanding the child itself. Arguably, this paper concludes that, on the one hand, this change of focus shows that our understanding of the child has progressed, but on the other hand, compared with Freud, it removes some of the building blocks upon which we base our experiences with child or of childhood...|$|E

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to synthesize evolutionary and developmental approaches to morphology, physiology, and behavior. Here we sketch one way to achieve such a synthesis that invokes ideas from evolutionary game theory. Developmental trajectories are often sensitive to environmental conditions. We reject the view, which is popular with some, that this sensitivity is well explained by a general plasticity. Instead we argue that flexibility is founded on a genetically encoded strategy, {{most or all of}} which is shared by the members of a population. Flexibility in the life course is achieved by the conditionalities inherent in the strategy. The strategy, which evolved by natural selection, allows an effective response to environmental variability. This enables organisms to perform well under a broad range of circumstances— a property that engineers call robustness. One of the earliest and most influential attempts to integrate evolution and ontogeny was made by Haeckel (1874) who argued in his recapitulation theory (or <b>biogenetic</b> <b>law)</b> that essentially all phenotypic differences among species arise late during development. His clever idea was that species can evolve only by the terminal addition of new adult stages at the end of ancestral developmental sequences. He believed, for example, that all vertebrates went through nearly identical developmental stages until very late in the developmental process. A chicken embryo and a human embryo would be almost impossible to distinguish—at least if one is examining Haeckel’s famous drawings.

Observations on the ecology and biology of species from Cameroon are presented. These concentrate on niche preferences, successions in disturbed habitats, cleaning behaviour and feeding. Reproductive biology and spermatozoan morphology are reviewed {{in relation to the}} systematics of the order. Putative hemispermatophores, found in the families Cheliferidae, Atemnidae and Withiidae, are described for the first time. The morphology of the female 'gonopods' (renamed gonosacs) is surveyed. Ontogeny is discussed in relation to Grandjean's stase concept and Nelson's formulation of the <b>biogenetic</b> <b>law.</b> The first known calyptostasic pseudoscorpion protonymph is described in a species of Pseudochthonius Balzan (Chthoniidae). The development of the chelal trichobothria is reinterpreted through the application of Grandjean's priority rule and a new system of ontogenetic notations proposed. A revised pseudoscorpion classification is presented, based on a cladistic analysis of the families. Two new suborders are recognized: the Avenenata, containing the superfamilies Chthonioidea and Feaelloidea; and the Venenata, comprising the superfamilies Neobisioidea, Garypoidea, Cheiridioidea and Cheliferoidea. The tribe Pseudotyrannochthoniini of the Chthoniidae is raised to the rank of a separate family. The tribe Hesperolpiini is transferred from the Olpiidae to the Garypidae and raised to subfamilial rank. The subfamily Garypininae is removed from the Olpiidae and given familial rank. The Holarctic genera Larca and Archeolarca are transferred from the Garypidae to the new subfamily Larcinae of the Geogarypidae. The phylogeny of the families is expressed in the cladogram: (((Pseudotyrannochthoniidae (Chthoniidae, Tridenchthoniidae)) (Feaellidae, Pseudogarypidae) ((Hyidae (Ideoroncidae, Bochicidae (Gymnobisiidae (Neobisiidae, Syarinidae)))) (Menthidae (Olpiidae, Garypidae) (Garypinidae, Geogarypidae)) (Sternophoridae (Pseudochiridiidae, Cheiridiidae) (Chernetidae (Atemnidae, Withiidae, Cheliferidae)))))))) [where parentheses indicate nested sets of relationships]. A phylogenetic revision of all species of the family Feaellidae is presented. The area cladogram for this group emphasises the isolated position of the South African biota and the close relationship between the East African, Indian and Madagascan faunas.

40|$|It is {{the intent}} of this paper to {{delineate}} the course of events showing relationships between museums and their environmental factors, especially zoological knowledge. In developing our paper we have followed the scientific method with no attempts to force the evolvement of theories. Our source material was found to be in institution reports, biographies, travel records, and histories of science, zoology, medicine, libraries, education, and human activity peripheral to these. We traced the museum movement of ancient times. We considered Aristotle and Galen, and evaluated their use of specimens. We presented evidence suggesting that the period during the Dark Ages (200 - 1050 A. D.) was not without its zoological collections, contrary to the general opinion. The Middle Period (1050 - 1450 A. D.) with its beginnings of deviation from Authority saw the enrichment of collections by the Crusades; we reviewed Mondino, the anatomist, and his girl assistant Alessandra Giliani. Mention was made of the activities in Natural History at the court of Frederick II. In the following period, we witnessed the founding of large collections by scholars and the nobility; we dwelt on Ruysch and other preparators, seeing for the first time grouping of specimens and descriptive labels. In the America of this time reference was made to the collections possessed by natives before the coming of the Europeans, and how these collections were subsequently one of the bases for a tabulation of the North American fauna. We met Charles Willson Peale, that fabulous character who “invented” the elements of the habitat group and combined them for the education of the scientist and layman alike. The Great Museum Age opened with the scientists taking pride in their vast array of forms and the dawn of great activity in the two interests of zoological research—classification and evolution. We have reviewed the relationship of museums to advances in the zoological sciences. These advances were reviewed in the fields of the scientific method, organic evolution, taxonomy and classification, <b>biogenetic</b> <b>law,</b> teaching, research, zoogeography and zoological techniques.

40|$|In 1903 {{the writer}} {{undertook}} {{a study of}} variation of the tiger beetles. The work here presented is the outgrowth of this beginning, and indeed includes some small portions regarding color patterns that were written in that year. The work has been prolonged for many reasons, but chief of these was the {{very large number of}} species in the group and the fact that an adequate understanding of the material could not be attained without consulting many large collections. Further, the experimental results obtained in 1906 demanded a firsthand study of the variations of the species concerned and their natural habitats. The accumulation of material and data was not completed until 1911. Some of this had to be studied, drawings made, etc., which with numerous other duties and enterprises under way made necessary much time to put it into the present form. A family with upwards of 1300 species of which more than 600 are in one genus and with characters which can be studied and analyzed, appeared to afford material which was sufficiently promising to justify delay. In the fourteen years that have elapsed since the problem was first undertaken at the suggestion of Dr. C. B. Davenport, the attention of biologists has shifted from variation, which was then the chief topic of interest, to experimental modification of characters, and finally to the methods of modern genetics. Various men have made numerous suggestions regarding the work, but in its final preparation the writer has been able to use only a few of them in a general way, and an attempt is made to present the facts and conclusions growing out of the material as simply as possible.

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 The major {{historical}} {{studies that}} have examined American biology have emphasized the development of experimental biology {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century. In this characterization, the descriptive branch of biology has often been treated as less than important and, in several cases, as a hindrance in the application of experimentalism to biology. As a result, one is often left with the impression that morphology and experimental biology represented two conflicting aims in biological investigation. A more balanced appraisal of the development of American biology can be obtained by examining the biological community in the last half of the nineteenth century. William Keith Brooks (1848 - 1908) was selected as a case study. Brooks was America's major morphologist. As such, his scientific work mirrored the twin goals of morphology; to describe the form and structure of organisms and to elucidate any possible ancestral relations of the organisms. In the last half of the century, embryological investigations or life histories were considered to yield the most information on the organism's ancestry. This followed from the widespread acceptance of the <b>biogenetic</b> <b>law</b> (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) and the acceptance of evolution theory. Brooks's own work fits into this characterization of morphological investigation. His studies were primarily upon the life histories of molluscs, hydromedusae, tunicates, brachiopods and crustaceans. In addition to carrying out an active research program, Brooks also dealt with several of the major problems facing morphology. The most critical problems were (1) developing an exact criterion for homology, the basic tool for phylogenetic reconstructions and (2) accounting for the facts of heredity and variation, upon which the theory of descent was based. Brooks's treatment of both of these problems provides an indication of his central position in American morphology. Brooks's position in the development of biology in the United States becomes even more central with an examination of his professional position. As a member of the original Biology Department faculty at Johns Hopkins University, the first graduate program in biology in America, Brooks trained a whole generation of American biologists. While several of these scientists remained morphologists, several others were important in the new application of experimental techniques to biology. The study of Brooks, his scientific work, his role as a morphologist, his position at Johns Hopkins and his response vis-a-vis the rise of experimentalism in biology reveals that the standard interpretation of late nineteenth-century biology is largely inaccurate. It is much more instructive to understand the role of descriptive biology and experimental biology in the development of American biology as being complementary...|$|E
40|$|The {{national}} priority question of education quality is {{considered in the}} article {{at the level of}} an in-depth – existential – function of the educational system, where the former arises. In that case, education appears not only as a social organism, but a fundamental form of understanding existence and self-realization of a person as a self-organized space and biosocial system in terms of an integral educational result. The mechanisms and effects of formal development logic become clear from such research perspective namely, that changes into philosophy of education {{in the shape of a}} single-dimensional methodological imperative and provides for an inconsistency of educational practice, achievement of some pedagogical aims at the expense and to the disadvantage of others. The limited nature of pedagogical thinking is not simply fixed in the paradoxes of human development as an individual and organism, but is considered as the main obstacle in the way of evolution of the Human-Nature-Society global system. The phenomenological comprehension of education problems supposes coming into the space of a spiritual idea, funding the process of searching for quality at different levels of human life and activities from within, which characterizes the topicality of the given article.   The aim of the scientific research is to analyze factors limiting the process of modern human development, and to ground the necessity of the fundamental updating of the education model in the noospheric scientific paradigm. Theoretical methods of research are used in the paper: analysis of scientific literature, system analysis, analogy, systematization, and generalization. The research results are represented in the categories of education philosophy and focus the reader’s attention mainly on its critical-reflexive function. Elimination of the subject of education is considered as a logical result of phenomenological reduction of thinking that loses a higher level of the Universal, divides the single living space into the “autonomous” spheres of life and at the same time hides the natural code of stability (health) of a person. The article contains the description of splitting of consciousness process, of a deep inversion of personality in the system of biological and social determination of development, analysis of the human’s two-headed problem (psychological-physiological and psychospiritual) and the limit of pedagogical thinking operating in modern practice of the students’ personality socialization. System insufficiency and functional danger of the traditional binary model of development is formed in the absence of clear ideas in pedagogics of the ontological structure of the subject and a complete concept of the individual, accumulation of the negative quality of individual and public lifestyles.  Therefore, it is possible to suppose that formation of an individual, a person – the object of the space, social and natural  system must become the aim and result of the modern educational mainstream. In such a case, Müller-Haeckel’s <b>biogenetic</b> <b>law</b> regulating traditional education must lose its methodological force. The proposed methodology of managing quality of education implies higher subjectness of development of the educational process participants, restoration of their personality unity based on noospheric pedagogical philosophy and requires expanding the regulatory principle of modeling educational practice up to the anthropocosmic one.    </p...|$|E
