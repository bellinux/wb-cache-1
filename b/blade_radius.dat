50|$|The driven region, {{also called}} the {{propeller}} region, is the region {{at the end of}} the blades. Normally, it consists of about 30 percent of the radius. It is the driven region that produces the most drag. The overall result is a deceleration in the rotation of the blade. The driving region, or autorotative region, normally lies between 25 and 70 percent of the <b>blade</b> <b>radius,</b> which produces the forces needed to turn the blades during autorotation. Total aerodynamic force in the driving region is inclined slightly forward of the axis of rotation, producing a continual acceleration force. This inclination supplies thrust, which tends to accelerate the rotation of the blade. Driving region size varies with blade pitch setting, rate of descent, and rotor rotational speed.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research work {{is to develop a}} simulation procedure for modeling the soil-tool interaction for a blade of arbitrary shape. The primary motivation for this study is developing agricultural robots with limited power and pulling force to help farmers in crop production. In this thesis, a finite element (FE) investigation of soil-blade interaction is presented. The soil is considered as an elastic-plastic material with the non-associated Drucker-Prager constitutive law. A separation procedure to model the cutting of soil and a method of calculating the forces acting on the blade are proposed and discussed in detail. The procedure uses a separation criterion that becomes active at consecutive nodes on the predefined separation surfaces. In order to mimic soil-blade sliding and soil-soil cutting phenomena contact elements with different properties are applied. To verify correctness of the FE model developed and the procedures used, the FE results are first compared with analytical results available for straight rectangular blades from classical soil mechanics theories; and then the FE results are compared with the experimental ones. Also the effects of blade width, depth and rake angle on blade’s draft force were studied by simulating soil-blade interaction with different blade’s dimensions. After the analytical and experimental validation of the results for straight rectangular blade, the rectangular curved shape blade was modeled in order to investigate the effects of changing the <b>blade’s</b> <b>radius</b> of curvature on the blade’s draft force. The soil interaction with straight triangular blade in different rake angles was simulated next. Since the analytical solutions are limited to rectangular blades, calculated draft forces for triangular blade were verified only experimentally. The triangular and rectangular blades with the same width and depth of interaction were also investigated. The results showed that triangular blade draft force is around half of the amount of force acting on the rectangular blade with the same rake angle. Also the effect of triangular blade’s sharpness and changing the <b>blade’s</b> <b>radius</b> of curvature on draft force was discussed. By changing the blade’s sharpness, the draft forces of triangular blade were calculated in two conditions of constant blade’s width and constant blade’s contact length. The approach presented in this thesis can be used to investigate the soil-tool interactions for real and more complex blade geometries and soil conditions, and ultimately for improving design of blades to be used in tillage operations...|$|R

40|$|The {{intentional}} or accidental {{cutting of}} thin shell structures {{by means of}} a sharp object is of interest in many engineering applications. The process of cutting involves several types of nonlinearities, such as large deformations, contact, crack propagation and, in the case of laminated shells, delamination. In addition to these, a special difficulty is represented by the blade sharpness, whose accurate geometric resolution would require meshes with characteristic size of the order of the <b>blade</b> curvature <b>radius.</b> A computational finite element approach for the simulation of blade cutting of thin shells is proposed and discussed. The approach is developed in an explicit dynamics framework. Solid-shell elements are used for the discretization, in view of possible future inclusion in the model of delamination processes. Since a sharp blade can interfere with the transmission of cohesive forces between the crack flanks in the cohesive process zone, standard cohesive interface elements are not suited for the simulation of this type of problems unless extremely fine meshes, with characteristic size comparable to the <b>blade</b> curvature <b>radius,</b> are used. To circumvent the problem, the use of a new type of directional cohesive interface element, previously proposed for the simulation of crack propagation in elastic shells, is further developed and reformulated for application to the cutting of elastoplastic thin structures, discretized by solid-shell elements.

40|$|For {{the past}} 20 years the DLR Institute of {{composite}} structures and adaptive systems {{is dedicated to}} the research on shape adaptation of all kinds of structures. Two projects that have been related to rotors and fixed wings are presented: active twist for higher harmonic control and morphing for leading edge devices. Regarding the active twist the goal of the current investigation is a high frequency (up to 6 /rev) twist deflection of the blade for individual blade control with relatively small amplitudes. The basic princi-ple of this technology is the skin integration of patch type actuators to introduce shear strain into the skin. Piezoceramic d 33 actuators are used for such purposes. The commercially available macro fiber composites were used for the DLR blades which are based on the passive BO 105 blade. Those blades are made of GFRP with a C spar and a rectangular plan form. The profile is NACA 23012. At the DLR such model rotor <b>blades</b> (<b>radius</b> 2 m) have been designed, built and tested. They show static tip twist amplitudes of ± 2 °, even under centrifugal loads. The dynamics needed to excite a blade at frequencies up to 100 Hz is given by the piezoceramic actuators. Cur-rently the blades for a fully instrumented rotor are being built so they can be tested in a wind tunnel in 2013. Large deformation morphing has been investigated with the goal to realize a smart seamless lead-ing edge for fixed wing aircrafts. This system consists of a kinematic chain which is holding the skin in place. The skin is designed flexible enough to be morphed into the take off and landing shape but strong enough to carry the aerodynamic loads into the substructure and to bare the strains of morphing. In order to do so, a skin design process is established, which allows to tailor the skin thickness {{in a way that the}} displacements introduced by the kinematics will morph the skin into the desired shape. Also the load introduction into the skin is of interest. In the end omega stringers are designed to distribute the load of morphing deflections into the skin, taking into account the string-ers stability and strength. The difference between the aerodynamically wanted target shape and the achieved shape is within tolerable limits. Besides the skin it is an important task to design the kinematics to deploy to a position of approx. 18 degrees. The kinematics has to follow the trajecto-ries given from structural investigations of the skin with minimum deviations. The experiences from these investigations are a great prerequisite for research towards rotor morphing...|$|R
