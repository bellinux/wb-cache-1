50|$|<b>Bensulide</b> is a {{selective}} organophosphate herbicide. It {{is one of}} a few organophosphate compounds that are used as a herbicide. Most of the others are used as insecticides. It is used on vegetable crops such as carrots, cucumbers, peppers, and melons and in cotton and turfgrass to control annual grasses such as bluegrass and crabgrass and broadleaf weeds. It is often applied before the weed seeds germinate (pre-emergence) in order to prevent them from germinating. It is available as granules or an emulsifiable concentrate. Estimates place the total U.S. use of <b>bensulide</b> at about 632,000 pounds annually. Application rates may be relatively heavy (up to 22.6 kg/ha) when it is used. The EPA classifies <b>Bensulide</b> as a General Use Pesticide.|$|E

40|$|The runoff {{of thirty}} turf {{herbicides}} commonly used on lawns, parks, and golf course fairways and greens throughout the United States was simulated using the TurfPQ model. The model {{was used to}} obtain ninety nine years of daily water input, water runoff, and herbicide runoff for ten locations: Boston, MA, Charlotte, NC, Denver, CO, Houston, TX, Indianapolis, IN, Jacksonville, FL, Los Angeles, CA, Minneapolis, MN, Portland, OR, and Wichita, KS. Results were summarized as mean annual herbicide runoff loads (g/ha), extreme event herbicide runoff loads corresponding to a 20 year return period (g/ha), mean herbicide runoff {{as a percentage of}} annual application, extreme event herbicide runoff as a percentage of annual application, mean annual water input (mm), and mean annual water runoff (mm). Urban areas that produced the highest herbicide runoff loads based on surface runoff were Boston, Charlotte, Houston, Indianapolis, and Jacksonville. Mean annual runoff loads did not surpass 3. 4 % of the annual herbicide application with most instances considerably less than 1 %. Extreme event runoff loads did not surpass 9 % of the annual herbicide application but were highly variable and appear to have been very dependent on both location and herbicide. The runoff loads of atrazine, <b>bensulide,</b> DSMA, ethofumesate, napropamide, pendimethalin, and siduron were the largest per hectare. Siduron has the most massive runoff load, which is mainly due to the large amount of the herbicide that is applied annually.

40|$|Organophosphate {{hydrolase}} (OPH, EC 3. 1. 8. 1) is {{a bacterial}} enzyme {{with a broad}} spectrum of potential substrates that include organophosphorus pesticides, herbicides, and chemical warfare agents. OPH has been expressed successfully in bacterial, fungal, and insect cell culture systems; however, none of these systems produces amounts of enzyme suitable for applications outside of the research laboratory. Therefore, a transgenic Zea mays L. (maize) system was developed to express OPH as an alternate to the current OPH expression systems. The bacterial gene encoding the OPH protein was optimized for transcriptional and translational expression in maize. The optimized gene was inserted into the maize genome under the control of embryo specific, endosperm specific, and constitutive plant promoters. Select transformants were analyzed for the expression of OPH. Expression was observed in the seeds of plants transformed with each of the three constructs with the highest expression observed with the embryo specific and constitutive promoter constructs. The highest OPH expressing lines of transgenic maize had expression levels higher than those reported for the E. coli expression system. OPH was purified from transgenic maize seed and analyzed for posttranslational modification and kinetic properties. OPH was observed to undergo a glycosylation event when expressed in maize that yielded at least two forms of OPH homogolous dimer. The glycosylated form of OPH bound tightly to the Concanavalin A sepharose and remained active after months of storage at room temperature. OPH activity was checked against a number of organophosphate herbicides. Enzymatic activity was observed against the herbicide Amiprophos-methyl and kinetic properties were measured. Enzymatic activity was also tested against the organophosphate Haloxon. Transgenic maize callus, leaf, and seed tissue could be screened for the presence of the optimized opd gene by enzymatic activity. Comparison of the growth of transgenic and control callus on media containing organophosphates showed that the transgenic callus was resistant to the herbicidal effects of haloxon. Transgenic plants expressing OPH were also resistant to the herbicide <b>bensulide</b> when compared to control plants. This indicates that OPH {{can be used as a}} screenable marker in plant systems and may be a potential scorable marker system as well...|$|E
40|$|African {{marigold}} (Tagetes erecta L.) was {{screened for}} tolerance to preemergence and postemergence herbicides. Three preemergence herbicides, pendimethalin, <b>bensulide,</b> and trifluralin, had an acceptable margin of crop safety {{both in the}} greenhouse and in the field when applied at one, two, and four times their labeled rates. Two postemergence herbicides, topramezone and encapsulated acetochlor, caused minimal visual injury to the crop and encapsulated acetochlor had a minimal effect on plant dry weight. Dry weight response to topramezone varied among experiments. Additional studies were conducted to better define African marigold tolerance to topramezone. African marigolds tolerated rates up to 36. 8 g topramezone ha- 1. Visual injury five days after application (DAA) was 3. 1 or less (one to nine scale) for plants treated with the label rate, 18. 4 g ha- 1, or less of topramezone. Fifteen DAA, injury was no longer evident. Applications of 73. 7 g ha- 1 and greater caused visual ratings exceeding 3. 5 at the five day evaluation and eventually resulted in plant death. Topramezone and acetochlor were applied in a tank mix to African marigold in the greenhouse and in the field. In the greenhouse, visual injury was 4. 6 or less seven DAA and plants made a full visual recovery by 15 DAA. In the field, visual injury was 3. 3 or less one week after application (WAA). Plants treated with 18. 4 g ha- 1 topramezone recovered by three WAA, other visual injury was less than 2. 7. Data from both studies indicated minimal injury and rapid visual recovery of treated plants. A study observing crop response to topramezone application when African marigold was grown in pendimethalin treated soils indicated that pendimethalin did not affect topramezone tolerance. A tank mix of topramezone with the insecticide malathion was evaluated to determine if tolerance of African marigold to topramezone is achieved through differential metabolism involving cytochrome P 450. Five and 15 DAA, malathion caused no increase in visual injury (P = 0. 3986 and P = 0. 1315). This indicates African marigold tolerance to topramezone is probably due to a selectivity mechanism other than cytochrome P 450 based metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Weeping grass (Microlaena stipoides (Labill.) R. Br. var stipoides) is an Australian native {{grass of}} {{widespread}} occurrence throughout Australia. It is a perennial, cool-season grass which produces slender rhizomes and remains green {{throughout the year}} producing high quality forage (Willis, 1970; Mitchell, 1994). It occurs naturally {{in a number of}} habitats from damp grasslands to heath, woodland and forest as well as shady parts of lawns and gardens. It is considered as having potential in the fields of amenity turf, grazing and revegetation since it produces green foliage all year, is tolerant of close grazing or mowing, acid soils, drought and shading, amongst other factors. Commercial production of weeping grass is desirable in order to make this grass available to the broader market. However a number of factors need to be considered before full commercialisation of this grass. Harlan (1960) indicated that seed production, seedling vigour and establishment were the critical factors in the successful domestication of a native grass. Aspects of these factors were considered in this thesis. Two experiments were undertaken to address the gaps in knowledge that prevent commercialisation of weeping grass. Experiment 1 considered the establishment of weeping grass and examined the use of pre-emergent herbicides on the seedling stage to determine if selective herbicides exist for this species. This experiment went on to consider the particular requirements for the best germination of seedlings in terms of the depth of sowing, {{the presence or absence of}} a mulch and the cleaning of the seed of its lemma and palea. Of the herbicides tested, Trifluralin was shown to be useful for this purpose in both spring and autumn and Pendimethalin was useful for spring applications. The other herbicides tested, Ethofumesate, Dithiopyr and <b>Bensulide</b> were not selective with weeping grass and cannot be recommended for use. For both seed treatments i. e. intact and cleaned, the two most shallow treatments provided the best germination results for the earliest days of assessment. For surface sown seeds the fastest germination was from seed that had been cleaned of its protective lemmas and which had been covered with a mulch. Experiment 2 considered several factors which may have an impact on the seed production of weeping grass. The factors considered were the effect of the accessions, nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation on seed production. It was found that there were significant variations between the accessions of weeping grass in regard to a number of factors related to reproductive growth. The accessions also showed variation in vegetative characters, and these results together highlight the potential for making suitable selections for desired characters from within the weeping grass gene pool. It was shown that weeping grass was strongly responsive to applications of nitrogen fertilizers, with late applications of nitrogen fertilizer promoting late season seed production. In regard to the irrigation treatments that were applied over the summer/autumn period, some accessions were more sensitive than others to the irrigation regime and the production of culms was more dependent upon the season than on soil moisture. However frequent irrigation did increase the number of culms. The irrigation effect on the increase in culm numbers and seed produced was more influenced by the frequency of irrigation than by the absolute amount of irrigation applied, with infrequent irrigation reducing the number of new culms and seeds compared to more frequent irrigation.
