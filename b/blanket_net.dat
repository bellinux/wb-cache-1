40|$|Buriami {{fishery is}} one of {{traditional}} fishing in Japan that is awfully considered the fish behavior toward the fishing gear. This fishery is operated to catch the red sea bream and Japanese sea bream in spring to early summer. Burinawa is a long rope equipped with many white painted strip Buriki and stone weight in regular intervals, and used for herding fish school from rocky bottom to shore. The operations of Buriami fishery, the constructions of Burinawa and some kinds of net gear were investigated in comparison with those at other locations. The operation and fishing gears of Buriami fishery in Yamagawa are almost {{the same as those}} of ancient type. It seemed that Buriami fishery is propagated from Setouchi region to here in former times. Traditional fishing operation caught by <b>blanket</b> <b>net</b> still remained in this place. It was concluded that Buriami fishery in Yamagawa was old fashioned, but with modern devices, adopting to the environment of fishing ground. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{fast breeder}} reactor fuel depletion-economics model was {{developed}} and applied {{to a number of}} 1000 MWe UMBR case studies, involving radial blanket-radial reflector design, radial blanket fuel management, and sensitivity of energy costs to changes in the economic environment. Choice of fuel cost accounting philosophy, e. g. whether or not to tax plutonium revenue, was found to have significant effect on absolute values of energy costs, without, however, distorting design rankings, comparative results, and irradiation time optimization. A single multigroup physics computation, to obtain the flux shape and local spectra for depletion calculations, was found to be sufficient for preliminary design and sensitivity studies. The major source of error in blanket depletion results was found to be the assumption of a fixed flux snape over an irradiation cycle; spectrum hardening in the radial blanket with irradiation is of minor importance. The simple depletion-economics model was applied to several 1000 NWe L 1 FBR case studies. Advantages of a moderating reflector were found to increase as blanket thickness was reduced. For a 45 cm radial blanket, a beryllium metal reflector offered little improvement, in blanket fuel economics, over sodium; for a 15 cm <b>blanket,</b> beryllium increased <b>net</b> <b>blanket</b> revenue by about 60 %. An improvement of about 30 % in <b>net</b> <b>blanket</b> revenue resulted when each radial blanket annular region was assumed to be expose" to its own local optimum irradiation time. Optimum radial blanket irradiation time and the <b>net</b> <b>blanket</b> revenue (mills/Khiie) at this optimum were found to be approximately linear in the unit fuel cycle costs, i. e. fabrication and reprocessing costs ($/ 4 gld) and fissile market value ($/kg).

50|$|The fusion process alone {{currently}} {{does not}} achieve sufficient gain (power output over power input) to be viable {{as a power}} source. By using the excess neutrons from the fusion reaction to in turn cause a high-yield fission reaction (close to 100%) in the surrounding subcritical fissionable <b>blanket,</b> the <b>net</b> yield from the hybrid fusion-fission process can provide a targeted gain of 100 to 300 times the input energy (an increase {{by a factor of}} three or four over fusion alone). Even allowing for high inefficiencies on the input side (i.e. low laser efficiency in ICF and Bremsstrahlung losses in Tokamak designs), this can still yield sufficient heat output for economical electric power generation. This {{can be seen as a}} shortcut to viable fusion power until more efficient pure fusion technologies can be developed, or as an end in itself to generate power, and also consume existing stockpiles of nuclear fissionables and waste products.|$|R

40|$|A {{possible}} {{concept for}} the blanket for next generation fusion devices is the lithium salt blanket, where lithium salt is dissolved {{in an aqueous}} coolant {{in order to provide}} for tritium. Type AISI 316 L stainless steel has been considered as a structural material for such a <b>blanket</b> for <b>NET</b> (Next European Torus), and a systematic study of the corrosion behaviour of 316 L stainless steel has been carried out in a number of lithium salt solutions. The experiments include cyclic potentiodynamic polarization measurement, crevice corrosion, corrosion fatigue and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) tests. This paper presents a part of novel corrosion results concerning the compatibility of 316 L steel and a series of other materials relevant to a fusion blanket environment. No major uniform corrosion problem has been observed, but localized corrosion, particularly corrosion fatigue and SCC, of 316 L stainless steel have been fund so far in a lithium hydroxide solution under some specific potential conditions. The critical electrochemical potential zones for SCC have been identified in the present study. status: publishe...|$|R

The local Red Cross chapter went to the worst affected villages with water, water purification tablets, <b>blankets,</b> and mosquito <b>nets.</b> Many of the affected families were unable to afford rebuilding their homes. Myanmar's National Disaster Relief Committee distributed 500tons of concrete and 50,000roofing sheets to help rebuild homes. By June8, all displaced residents were either staying with relatives or returned to their homes, with the reconstruction or resettlement process expected to take up to nine months. Myanmar's then-Prime Minister Khin Nyunt surveyed the damaged areas and held a ceremony on June7 in Sittwe, where domestic donations were transferred to the government in [...] "the spirit of national consolidation". The Prime Minister stated that the country rarely experiences devastating cyclones due to their strong religious beliefs. A group of 35Rohingya people from Yangon took a tour of Rakhine State after the storm, despite they are usually banned from the region. The group donated about $267,000 (USD), although due to their minority status in the country, the aid did not help other Rohingyas in the state, who also did not receive assistance from the government.|$|R

5000|$|Kids for Kids {{supports}} {{grass roots}} projects that communities identify {{as the most}} effective way of enabling them to help themselves. [...] "We don't believe in charity" [...] said Parker [...] "our aim is to empower women to take charge of their own lives, long term". First priority is water {{and for the first time}} in a long while the Water Environment and Sanitation Department in North Darfur is in a position to drill as many hand pumps as Kids for Kids has money for. [...] "A hand pump can be named after a donor" [...] says Parker. Many Kids for Kids pumps are treasured as a living memorial for someone who has died, or to celebrate something special. In some areas, where hand pumps prove that there is plentiful water, they can be converted to submersible solar powered pumps which will help many people. This year one of the villages Kids for Kids is adopting is Kulkul, the village rebels took Parker and her son Alastair to when they were capture in 2005. Parker is hoping to be able to provide the first Kids for Kids' Solar Powered pump if they can raise the £20,000 ($30,358) Other Projects include the training of midwives—there is no health care in villages so that when there is obstructed labour, a common complication in a region where FGM (female genital mutilation) is widespread, means that rope delivery is the only form of help—first aid workers who treat simple wounds, teach hygiene and even build latrines—provide veterinary care, train in farming techniques and water harvesting, provide donkeys—the only transport in a region where there are no roads—donkey ploughs, carts and water carts, farm tools and seeds, <b>blankets,</b> mosquito <b>nets</b> and other household essentials—and, most importantly, the provision and repair of hand pumps. Long term improvement of the environment, the planting of trees, is another priority, and forms another source of income for families. An extensive tree planting campaign has been funded since 2006, with a Demonstration Garden in the main Tree Nursery in El Fasher, where trees planted back in 2006 are now tall enough to give shade and where people come to picnic at weekends. Kids for Kids has also funded a new Midwives Training School in El Fasher where they fund the training of 40 village midwives each year. But the Key project is a Goat Loan. The poorest 15 percent of families in each Kids for Kids village is lent six goats to provide milk immediately for the children and to enable mothers to have a livelihood as the little flock multiplies. At the end of two years six goats are passed on to another poor family, and so on. Eventually the whole community benefits from this simple, life changing, loan. It has been called the best Microfinance project ever. To ensure that the projects are sustainable and there is clear accountability, the management of the projects is carried out by village committees which are trained in book keeping—but, most importantly, they are accountable to their own communities. This has ensured that the projects have survived even during the worst periods of violence.|$|R
