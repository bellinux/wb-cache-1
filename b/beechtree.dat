On the hills around the town, the following indigenous trees are found: Drimys winteri (Winter's bark), Maytenus magellanica (Hard-log Mayten) and several species of Nothofagus (Southern <b>Beech).Trees</b> in Ushuaia tend to follow the wind direction, and are therefore called [...] "flag-trees", for their uni-directional growth pattern.|$|R
60|$|And very luxuriously {{we turned}} once {{more into the}} lanes, enjoying the past, scenting the future. Close to home, the first little eddy of wind stirred, and the song of {{dripping}} twigs began; an owl hooted, honey-soft, in the fog. We came on two farm hands mending the lane {{at the turn of}} the avenue, and, curled on the top of the bank, their cosy red collie pup, waiting for them to finish work for the day. He raised his sharp nose and looked at us dewily. We turned down, padding softly in the wet fox-red drifts under the <b>beechtrees,</b> whereon the last leaves still flickered out in the darkening whiteness, that now seemed so little eerie. We passed the grey-green skeleton of the farm-yard gate. A hen ran across us, clucking, into the dusk. The maze drew her long, home-coming snuffle, and stood still. 1910.|$|R
60|$|Now {{if there}} be one principle, or secret more than another, on which Turner depends for {{attaining}} brilliancy of light, {{it is his}} clear and exquisite drawing of the shadows. Whatever is obscure, misty, or undefined in his objects or his atmosphere, he takes care that the shadows be sharp and clear--and then {{he knows that the}} light will take care of itself, and he makes them clear, not by blackness, but by excessive evenness, unity, and sharpness of edge. He will keep them clear and distinct, and make them felt as shadows, though they are so faint, that, but for their decisive forms, we should not have observed them for darkness at all. He will throw them one after another like transparent veils, along the earth and upon the air, till the whole picture palpitates with them, and yet the darkest of them will be a faint gray, imbued and penetrated with light. The pavement on the left of the Hero and Leander, is about the most thorough piece of this kind of sorcery that I remember in art; but of the general principle, not one of his works is without constant evidence. Take the vignette of the garden opposite the title-page of Rogers's Poems, and note the drawing of the nearest balustrade on the right. The balusters themselves are faint and misty, and the light through them feeble; but the shadows of them are sharp and dark, and the intervening light as intense as it can be left. And see how much more distinct the shadow of the running figure is on the pavement, than the checkers of the pavement itself. Observe the shadows on the trunk of the tree at page 91, how they conquer all the details of the trunk itself, and become darker and more conspicuous than any part of the boughs or limbs, and so in the vignette to Campbell's <b>Beechtree's</b> Petition. Take the beautiful concentration of all that is most characteristic of Italy as she is, at page 168 of Rogers's Italy, where we have the long shadows of the trunks made by far the most conspicuous thing in the whole foreground, and hear how Wordsworth, the keenest-eyed of all modern poets for what is deep and essential in nature, illustrates Turner here, as we shall find him doing in all other points.|$|R

50|$|The station first {{signed on}} the air {{sometime}} in August 1976 when it became fully licensed by the FCC. Its original owner was Joseph W. Meyers, the controller of Lincoln Broadcasting of Hodgenville, Kentucky. The station was operated under the licensee name of Lincoln Broadcasting until the license was reassigned to Butler County Broadcasting in the 1977-1978 winter season. In April 1978, the station was under ownership of the late Charles Black, who was also mayor of Morgantown at the time. Butler County Broadcasting was renamed <b>BeechTree</b> Publishing sometime in the 2000s, hence the previous branding that {{was used by the}} station until 2015.|$|E
5000|$|From the 1994 <b>Beechtree</b> {{paperback}} reprint: [...] "In recent decades, folk {{tales and}} fairy tales from {{all corners of}} the earth have been made available in a variety of handsome collections and in lavishly illustrated picture books. But in the 1950s, such a rich selection was not yet available. The classic fairy and folk tales were most often found in cumbersome books with small print and few illustrations. Helen Jones, then children's book editor at Little, Brown and Company, accepted a proposal from a Boston librarian for an ambitious series with a simple goal—to put an international selection of stories into the hands of children. The tales would be published in slim volumes, with wide margins and ample leading, and illustrated by a cast of contemporary artists. The result was a unique series of books intended for children to read by themselves—the Favorite Fairy Tales series. Available only in hardcover for many years, the books have now been reissued in paperbacks that feature new illustrations and covers. | The series embraces the stories of sixteen different countries: Czechoslovakia, Denmark, England, India, France, Italy, Ireland, Germany, Greece, Japan, Scotland, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Spain and Russia. Some of these stories may seem violent or fantastical to our modern sensibilities, yet they often reflect the deepest yearnings and imaginings of the human mind and heart. Virginia Haviland traveled abroad frequently and was able to draw upon librarians, storytellers, and writers in countries as far away as Japan to help her make her selections. But she was also an avid researcher with a keen interest in rare books, and most of the stories she included in the series were found through a diligent search of old collections. Ms. Haviland was associated with the Boston Public Library for nearly thirty years—as a children's and branch librarian, and eventually as Readers Advisor to Children. She reviewed for The Horn Book Magazine for almost thirty years and in 1963 was named Head of the Children's Book Section of the Library of Congress. Ms. Haviland remained with the Library of Congress for nearly twenty years, and wrote and lectured about children's literature throughout her career. She died in 1988." ...|$|E

40|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} and fatal brain disorder that causes cognitive decline and eventual loss {{of the ability to}} interact and communicate with others. Family involvement and interaction have been shown to have many therapeutic benefits for people with Alzheimer's disease. However, the decline in cognitive ability and communication skills makes it particularly challenging for family members to have fulfilling and engaging visits. The Family Visit Program (FVP) aims to study the effect of the physical environment and sensory stimulation on the quality of visits using four treatments: existing furniture onsite, a conversation booth, a photo album, and a digital picture frame and stand. The conversation booth was designed as an ergonomic seating unit that helps focus attention by reducing visual and acoustic distractions. The digital picture frame and book-style photo album are intended to serve as the display mediums for the source of stimulation, personally meaningful photographs. The use of existing furniture in the setting is to compare the impact the design intervention has on the quality of interaction. The research was conducted at <b>Beechtree</b> Care Center, a nursing and rehabilitation facility in Ithaca, NY. The study includes three groups of participants: residents, family members, and staff. Original data are collected and analyzed from video recordings, interviews with all participants, and researcher field notes. The goal is to contribute understanding of how to design an environment and therapeutic sensory intervention that facilitates communication with family members and supports the physical and cognitive needs of people with Alzheimer's disease. 2019 - 01 - 2...|$|E
