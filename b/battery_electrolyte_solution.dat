However, {{in some cases the}} presence of such co-solvents does not directly translate into improved low temperature cell performance, presumably due to the formation of ionically resistive surface films on carbonaceous anodes. In order to understand this behavior, a number of lithium-graphite cells have been studied containing electrolytes with various ester co-solvents, including methyl acetate (MA), ethyl acetate (EA), ethyl propionate (EP), and ethyl butyrate (EB). The charge/discharge characterization of these cells indicates that the higher molecular weight esters result in electrolytes which possess superior low temperature performance in contrast to the lower molecular weight ester-containing solutions, even though these solutions display lower conductivity values...|$|R

40|$|Lithium Air (Li-air) {{batteries}} using aprotic organic electrolytes offer {{a higher}} theoretical specific energy and capacity than conventional lithium battery chemistries and other metal air batteries. However, actual Li-air batteries do not demonstrate these high theoretical capacities because the reduction products, Li 2 O and Li 2 O 2, have very low solubilities in common aprotic electrolyte solvents, like propylene carbonate (PC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC). This leads to premature air electrode failure because the precipitates either block the pores {{of the carbon}} electrode or passivate the carbon surface. [1] Xu et al. recently suggested that electrolyte solvents that demonstrate increased Li 2 O and Li 2 O 2 solubility should lead to higher discharge capacity. [2] We have recently began to use methoxybenzene (also known as anisole) as a cosolvent in Li-air <b>battery</b> <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solutions.</b> [3] The solubility of Li 2 O in methoxybenzene is four times higher than PC.

40|$|In this work, the {{electrochemical}} quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) technique {{was applied to}} the study of the charge-discharge cycling of lithium electrodes in a few important Li <b>battery</b> <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solutions.</b> These included ethyl-ene and dimethyl carbonates (EC-DMC) mixtures containing LiAsF 6 or LiPF 6 as the electrolyte, tetrahydrofuran (THF) -EC/LiAsF 6 solutions of two different solvent ratios, and 1 - 3 -dioxolane/LiAsF 6 solutions. The substrate electrode was nickel plated on the quartz crystal. All the experiments were conducted in potentiostatic mode. After an initial step in which the electrode was polarized from open-circuit potential to 0 V (Li/Li F), repeated deposition-dissolution steps were conducted within predetermined potential limits. These experiments proved the superiority of 1 - 3 -dioxolane/LiAsF 6 solutions as a selected electrolyte system for rechargeable Li batteries with Li metal anode. The EQCM studies revealed that in both EC-DMC or EC-THF solutions, Li deposition is accompanied by a pronounced corrosion and accumulation of surface species that further partially dissolve during the anodic steps. These studies also reflected the difference in the surface chemistry developed on lithium in EC-THF solutions of different EC concentrations. At low EC concentration the Li passivity is better, and thus cycling efficiency is higher. This correlates well with previous studies which revealed that at low EC concentrations in ethereal solutions, Li 2 CO 3 is an important component in the Li surface films. mpe...|$|R

To do so, a new model was used in predicting the hydrate formation conditions in presence of both single and mixed <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solutions.</b> The new model {{is based on the}} van der Waals- Platteeuw hydrate equation of state. In order to evaluate the values for the activity of water in <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solutions</b> the simplified version of the Ghotbi-Vera Mean Spherical Approximation (SGV-MSA) model was used. According to the SGV-MSA model the ions in the solutions are considered as charged hard spheres with different sizes. The values of the parameters for the SGV-MSA model are independent of temperature and depend only on the nature as well as concentration of electrolytes studied in this work. These parameters were obtained using the experimental data for the mean ionic activity coefficient of the single <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solutions</b> at 298. 15 K.
