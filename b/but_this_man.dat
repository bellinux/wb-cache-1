25|$|Are {{you aware}} that Claude Pepper is known all over Washington as a shameless extrovert? Not only that, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> is {{reliably}} reported to practice nepotism with his sister-in-law, he has a brother who is a known homo sapiens, {{and he has a}} sister who was once a thespian in wicked New York. Worst of all, it is an established fact that Mr. Pepper, before his marriage, habitually practiced celibacy.|$|E
25|$|The species {{within the}} {{hymenopteran}} order commonly sting or bite others {{with which they}} interact. After a man was stung by a European hornet, he experienced tingling {{at the site of}} contact, as well as headaches and shortness of breath. In the hospital, he was found to have a fast, irregular heartbeat with a blood pressure of 111/63. His subsequent ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. V. crabro toxin contains neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenalineneurotoxin apamin, as well as enzymes phospholipase A and hyaluronidase, the compound histamine, and proteins melittin and bradykinin. These compounds have been shown to cause tachycardia episodes in smaller animals. The mechanism of this attack is still undetermined, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> possibly was just more susceptible to vespine stings than other humans. Currently, the two most effective treatments are electrical cardioversion or propafenone. The man in this case study was given an oral dose of propafenone (150mg) and his atrial fibrillation resolved.|$|E

2500|$|The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer {{told what}} {{happened}} in [...] after Moses asked to behold God's Presence in [...] Moses foretold that he would behold God's Glory and make atonement for the Israelites' iniquities on Yom Kippur. On that day, Moses asked God (in the words of [...] ) [...] "Show me, I pray, Your Glory." [...] God told Moses that Moses {{was not able to}} see God's Glory lest he die, as [...] reports God said, [...] "men shall not see Me and live," [...] but for the sake of God's oath to Moses, God agreed to do as Moses asked. God instructed Moses to stand at the entrance of a cave, and God would cause all God's angels to pass before Moses. God told Moses to stand his ground, and not to fear, as [...] reports, [...] "And He said, I will make all My Goodness pass before you." [...] God told Moses that when he heard the Name that God had spoken to him, then Moses would know that God was before him, as [...] reports. The ministering angels complained that they served before God day and night, and they were unable to see God's Glory, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> Moses born of woman desired to see God's Glory. The angels arose in wrath and excitement to kill Moses, and he came near to death. God intervened in a cloud to protect Moses, as [...] reports, [...] "And the Lord descended in the cloud." [...] God protected Moses with the hollow of God's hand so that he would not die, as [...] reports, [...] "And it shall come to pass, while My Glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with My hand." [...] When God had passed by, God removed the hollow of God's hand from Moses, and he saw traces of the Shechinah, as [...] says, [...] "And I will take away My hand, and you shall see my back." [...] Moses began to cry with a loud voice, and Moses said the words of [...] "O Lord, O Lord, a God full of compassion and gracious [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Moses asked God to pardon the iniquities of the people in connection with the Golden Calf. God told Moses that if he had asked God then to pardon the iniquities of all Israel, even to the end of all generations, God would have done so, as it was the appropriate time. But Moses had asked for pardon with reference to the Golden Calf, so God told Moses that it would be according to his words, as [...] says, [...] "And the Lord said, â€˜I have pardoned according to your word.'" ...|$|E
