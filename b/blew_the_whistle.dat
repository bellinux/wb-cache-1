40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Accountancy)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, School of Accountancy, 2014. This thesis {{presents}} {{empirical evidence}} {{of the factors that}} motivate trainee auditors to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> on wrongdoing in an audit firm. It investigates whether organisational justice (comprised of procedural, interactional and distributive justice) is positively correlated with <b>the</b> willingness to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle.</b> It also investigates whether the type of justice (procedural, interactional and distributive justice) affects <b>the</b> decision to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle.</b> Finally, it investigates whether professional performance, morality-proxied by a sense of religion-, seniority, age and gender affect this decision to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle.</b> <b>The</b> results indicate that most trainee auditors‟ sense of organisational justice is positively correlated to their likelihood to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle.</b> All three justice dimensions (procedural, interactional and distributive justice) are found to increase trainee auditors‟ propensity to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle.</b> High interactional justice is found to be a greater motivation to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> than procedural and distributive justice. Low distributive justice is found to be least effective as an impediment to whistleblowing, whilst low procedural and interactional justice are more effective than low distributive justice in deterring whistleblowing. This research finds that age, gender, seniority and religion do not affect the trainee auditor‟s propensity to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle.</b> Most recent performance ratings do not affect trainee auditors‟ decision to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle,</b> except in <b>the</b> case of trainees who received a low performance rating when there was low interactional justice...|$|R

The results indicate that a friendship or team climate generally explains willingness to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle,</b> but not <b>the</b> actual frequency of <b>blowing</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle.</b> Instead, supervisory status, a control variable investigated in previous studies, is the most consistent predictor of both willingness to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> and frequency of <b>blowing</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle.</b> Contrary to popular belief, the results also generally indicate that police are more inclined than civilian employees to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> in Georgia – in other words, they are less inclined to maintain a code of silence.

40|$|In {{this study}} we focused on key {{concepts}} – moral identity and fairness – in order to explain whistleblowing intention. We {{examined the relationship between}} intention to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> and moral identity, and explored the moderating effect of perceived supervisor procedural fairness in this relationship. Our results showed that employees (N = 278) with a strong moral identity were more likely to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> on wrongdoing of which they had become aware of, and employees who were low in moral identity were less likely to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle.</b> Furthermore, we found that the impact of moral identity on <b>the</b> intention to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> is increased by high procedural fairness, and that low procedural fairness leaves this relationship insignificant.

25|$|Starting in June 2006, Senior Vice President Richard M. Bowen III, {{the chief}} {{underwriter}} of Citigroup's Consumer Lending Group, began warning {{the board of}} directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses. The group bought and sold $90 billion of residential mortgages annually. Bowen's responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the unit's creditworthiness. When Bowen first <b>blew</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> in 2006, 60% of the mortgages were defective. The amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout 2007 and eventually exceeded 80% of the volume. Many of the mortgages were not only defective, but were fraudulent. Bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications. On November 3, 2007, Bowen emailed Citigroup Chairman Robert Rubin and the bank's chief financial officer, head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses, claiming that the group's internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit. The subsequent investigation revealed that at the Consumer Lending Group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since 2005. Regardless of the findings of the investigation, Bowen's charges were ignored, despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX), which he had pointed out. Citigroup CEO Charles Prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with SOX despite Bowen revealing this wasn't so. Citigroup eventually stripped Bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission asked him to testify about Citigroup's role in the mortgage crisis, and he did so, appearing {{as one of the first}} witnesses before the Commission in April 2010.|$|E

3000|$|Complementary to {{the direct}} impact of whistle-blowing {{regulations}} in a code on misconduct is {{its impact on}} whether people report observed misconduct. Reporting misconduct has always been possible and has always occurred. Ultimately, a person needs an initial motivation to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> on someone. This motivation may arise from indignation about observed misconduct or other sources, but is a personal feature and as such exogenous to the organizational setting. Still, the organizational setting affects, how the exogenous motivation to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> translates into actual whistle-blowing. The idea underlying formalized whistle-blowing systems is to use mutual control as a reliable element of the company’s control and compliance system. However, as we elaborated above, the whistle-blower will consider the costs and risks involved by <b>blowing</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> on someone, in particular retaliation. Nevertheless, companies can affect how employees deal with observing misconduct. First, mentioning <b>the</b> possibility to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> on observed misconduct will bring this option {{to the attention of}} employees, signaling that <b>blowing</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> is legitimate and indeed expected. This per se should increases the likelihood to report misconduct. Second, the way whistle-blowing is organized affects potential costs for <b>blowing</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> and <b>the</b> company may, as we elaborated in the above paragraph, lower them by choosing a particular setting. Ceteris paribus, the chances that whistle-blowing occurs, are higher, when the whistle-blowing is organized externally rather than internally.

40|$|Whistleblowing {{is a form}} of pro-social {{behaviour}} {{that occurs}} when a current or former employee reports organisational wrongdoing to any authority that is able to implement corrective action. While models of whistleblowing indicate that a number of social factors may influence an employee’s decision to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle,</b> very little cognisance is given to the role of organisational trust in such situations. Since whistleblowing situations often pose problems for whistleblowers, organisational trust becomes an important facilitator for <b>the</b> decision to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle.</b> This study explores whether organisational trust is an influencing social factor that may facilitate whistleblowing. It is found that organisational trust plays a significant role in decisions to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle.</b> It shows in particular that when organisational trust exists, employees are more likely to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle,</b> and secondly, that whistleblowing is more likely to take place internally rather than externally.

Time took an important role and as it ran down, it only benefited América de Cali. Deportes Tolima had won their match, Deportivo Pereira were tying their match, and Nacional had scored their second goal.
