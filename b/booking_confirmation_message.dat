That is, whenever an {{email address is}} presented for subscription to the list, the list software should send a <b>confirmation</b> <b>message</b> to that address. The <b>confirmation</b> <b>message</b> contains no advertising content, {{so it is not}} construed to be spam itself — and the address is not added to the live mail list unless the recipient responds to the <b>confirmation</b> <b>message.</b> See also the Spamhaus Mailing Lists vs. Spam Lists page.|$|R

3000|$|Once the RN has {{achieved}} L 1 /L 2 synchronization with the target eNB (and {{in the second}} case, in addition to this, also when all the UEs have resynchronized with the RN), the RN sends a handover <b>confirmation</b> <b>message</b> (RRC connection reconfiguration complete) to the new donor eNB. This confirmation is a composite message that includes information about each UE that is being served through the RN. The new donor eNB then sends out a path switch request to the Mobility Management Entity (MME), which initiates a user plane update request to the serving gateway. User plane update is then performed by the serving gateway for each UE indicated in the composite handover <b>confirmation</b> <b>message.</b> A user plane update basically switches the downlink data path to the target eNB. The serving gateway then sends [...] "end marker" [...] packets to the source eNB, {{to indicate that the}} old path {{is not going to be}} used anymore for the concerned UEs.

40|$|The {{dissemination}} of disaster early warning messages {{has a significant}} role in the effectiveness and serviceability in an Early Warning System (EWS). Providing the community in a disaster area with an adequate dissemination and communication of early warning messages will improve people's awareness and reaction to a natural hazard. People who live in a disaster area play a crucial role in the success of EWS. Malaysian, Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi and Indonesian authorities employ mobile phone applications, such as text messages (SMS), as a tool for disaster warning messages. However, there are many challenges in methods for disseminating early warning messages. One of the challenges is the dissemination method in which only notification messages are sent. In this paper, we propose <b>confirmation</b> or verification <b>messages,</b> as part of disaster early warning messages, by using text <b>messages.</b> <b>Confirmation</b> <b>messages</b> are messages that use a verification channel to provide up-to- date official information about the latest natural disaster conditions.

30|$|SAT [17] i.e., Secure Aggregation Tree is {{a method}} that detects and {{prevents}} cheating in the network. This method does not use any cryptographic operation; however, detection of cheating {{is based on the}} topological constraints in the aggregation tree. This method is different from other proposed methods as it is based on cheating detection instead of persistent data authentication. With topological constraints in SAT, each node can hear all messages sent to its father node and message sent by a father node to its grandfather node, that help to check whether father node performs the Data Aggregation correctly or not. If the father node sends aggregated value which is different from the correct aggregation value, then the node will raise an alert. On receiving the alert message by neighbouring nodes they all check whether the cheating node is its father node or not. If yes, then weighted confidence is evaluated. If the weighted confidence value is larger than a predefined threshold value, then the father node is assigned to be cheating node and a detection <b>confirmation</b> <b>message</b> is broadcasted within a given hop limit. After that, the node receiving the detection <b>confirmation</b> <b>message</b> will use recovery mechanism to avoid using the compromised node. During Data Aggregation, a metric to represent the degree of belief is generated for defining the uncertainty in the aggregated result. This framework effectively measures the uncertainty in both data and aggregation result.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{selective}} aperiodic checkpointing approach for VLR (Visitor Location Register) failure restoration in wireless mobile networks. In this approach, the VLR data are backed {{up in the}} non-volatile storage whenever the location update counter for that VLR exceeds the pre-determined threshold. It restores the backed up VLR data after {{the failure of the}} VLR and sends location <b>confirmation</b> request <b>messages</b> only to the selected Registration Areas (RAs) whose information is updated between the time period of back up and failure of the VLR. This is necessary as this information is obsolete in the backed up VLR for this reason and needs to be updated in the restored VLR. However, previous work on aggressive restoration based on periodic and aperiodic checkpointing also provide solutions for VLR database failure recovery. But these solutions are not feasible as they broadcast the location <b>confirmation</b> request <b>messages</b> to the RAs whose location information is found to be obsolete during the restoration. The analytical model and experimental results also show that the proposed method outperforms other previous approaches as it selectively sends the location <b>confirmation</b> request <b>messages</b> instead of broadcasting to the RAs during VLR restoration process...|$|R

Such cancellation messages pose no security risk to the regular EMV payment application, but can be cryptographically verified and are generated by an EMV card only after the correct PIN has been entered. It provided the CAP designers a way to create strong cryptographic evidence that a PIN-activated EMV card is present and has seen some given input data, without having to add any new software functions to EMV cards already in use.|$|R
