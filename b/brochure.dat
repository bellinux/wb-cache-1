40|$|AbstractDespite {{the high}} number of {{publications}} concerning medical texts, there is a considerable gap in research regarding an important element: medical <b>brochures</b> (Mayor Serrano, 2003). These texts are more and more frequent in health centres to transmit specialised information to the general public (Busch Lauer 1995). Knowing the behaviour of a genre in two different languages is important for translation (García Izquierdo, 2002). Our work is based on a previous contrastive analysis about the genre of medical <b>brochures</b> both in English and in Spanish (Faya Ornia, 2015). Here we will observe if medical <b>brochures</b> translated into English in Spain comply with the features of Spanish <b>brochures,</b> or if a functionalist approach has been adopted and therefore suitable adaptations have been made according to the English source <b>brochures.</b> In order to carry out our analysis, we worked with three corpora: source medical <b>brochures</b> in English (collected in the UK), source medical <b>brochures</b> in Spanish (collected in Spain) and medical <b>brochures</b> translated into English and published in Spain. The analysis is based on Nord's functional model (2005), which has been completed with Kress and van Leeuwen's contributions (2006) regarding visual material. To conclude, we will mention the possible reasons that make Spanish <b>brochures</b> more shocking and varied than English ones, as well as address the fact that translated <b>brochures</b> are similar to the Spanish <b>brochures</b> in some aspects but similar to the English <b>brochures</b> in others...|$|R
40|$|The study investigates experiential {{meanings}} in tourism <b>brochures</b> on the topics golfing, diving and adventure from a Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) perspective, particularly the System of Transitivity by Halliday and Mathiessen (2014). Six tourism <b>brochures</b> from Malaysia and Thailand were studied which are two each on golfing, diving and adventure. The data were analysed from the System of Transitivity (Process types, Participants and Circumstantial elements). Previous {{studies have focused}} on the representation of destination images and culture in tourism <b>brochures</b> rather than linguistic realisations in tourism <b>brochures</b> (e. g. Camprubi, Guia & Comas, 2012; Hassan, 2014; Jalis, Che & Markwell, 2014). Hence, this study is significant in filling the research gap. The findings reveal that all process types were employed in all <b>brochures.</b> The findings show that material, relational and mental processes were the major process types in tourism <b>brochures</b> studied. Relational processes were mainly used in tourism <b>brochures</b> from Malaysia for promoting golfing while material processes were mainly used in tourism <b>brochures</b> from Thailand in promoting golfing. Material processes were highly used to promote diving and adventure in tourism <b>brochures</b> from Malaysia while relational processes were highly used to promote diving and adventure in tourism <b>brochures</b> from Thailand. The study concludes that two different process types, relational and material processes were highly used on the same topics of tourism <b>brochures</b> from Malaysia and Thailand while Circumstance of Space was highly used in all tourism <b>brochures</b> from Malaysia and Thailand. The study has proved that SFL is a useful analytical tool for studying authentic text and is able to bring out the implications of the language used in tourism <b>brochures.</b> It is hoped that the findings of the study will provide language practitioners valuable insights on how tourism <b>brochures</b> are written and what descriptive and persuasive features are used in them...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this conference}} is to present {{the results of an}} {{analysis}} of the text genre of medical <b>brochures</b> that have been translated into English and published in Spain. We will contrast the results of this work with those obtained in a previous study of original medical <b>brochures</b> both in English and Spanish. Here, we will try to determine whether the <b>brochures</b> translated into English in Spain are influenced by original Spanish <b>brochures</b> or whether, on the contrary, they comply with the features of the target culture. In order to extract the features of each language, we have worked with a corpus of 250 documents (100 <b>brochures</b> in Spanish, 100 in English and 50 <b>brochures</b> translated into English and published in Spain) ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Health {{education}} {{is the cornerstone of}} primary health care. Health education materials distributed to the community should, therefore, be suitable and effective. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the health education <b>brochures,</b> designed and disseminated by Ministry of Health institutions in the Qassim province. Materials and Methods: The study was a cross-sectional review of health education <b>brochures.</b> We used a structured evaluation form, comprising general information on the <b>brochures</b> and a modified Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM) score sheet. The SAM consisting of 22 criteria in six groups, includes content, literacy demands, graphics, layout/typography, learning stimulation/motivation, and cultural appropriateness. SAM criteria categorize written material into "superior," "adequate" and "not suitable. " Two qualified consultant family physicians evaluated the <b>brochures.</b> Data were analyzed using Epi Info version 3. 4 statistical package. Results: We evaluated 110 <b>brochures,</b> the majority of which addressed chronic health conditions such as mental health, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Seventy-four (67. 3 %) <b>brochures</b> were evaluated as "adequate," 34 (30. 9 %) as "not suitable" and 2 (1. 8 %) as "superior. " "Cultural appropriateness" was the highest scoring factor, with 92 (83. 6 %) <b>brochures</b> falling into either the "superior" or "adequate" category. With regard to "content," 88 (80. 0 %) <b>brochures</b> fell into either the "superior" or "adequate" category. This was the second highest scoring factor. Graphics was the factor that scored the least. Seventy-five (68. 2 %) <b>brochures</b> were rated in this factor as "not suitable. " Conclusions: Although two-thirds of our <b>brochures</b> were considered "adequate," the majority needed improvement to their graphics and learning stimulation factors. We recommend that guidelines for designing health education <b>brochures</b> should be formulated to improve the quality of health education <b>brochures...</b>|$|R

Our results indicate that both <b>brochures</b> about FP and a detailed DA have beneficial effects with regard to knowledge, but the DA seemed to introduce slightly more decisional conflict (DC) than the <b>brochures.</b> Although we encountered challenges with recruitment, our design and measurements seem feasible and the effects of the information materials seem promising, hence justifying conducting a larger study...|$|R

Methods: Two series of focus groups were completed, with a total of seven groups and 39 participants.

Results: All participants thought that the <b>brochures</b> motivated them to talk with their health care providers about screening.

Messages concerning oral health and smoking were developed to emphasize the benefits of quitting smoking (gain-framed) or the costs of continued smoking (loss-framed). These messages were embedded in recruitment <b>brochures</b> for smoking cessation trials, which were placed in twenty dental office waiting rooms for a six-month period. The number of <b>brochures</b> taken from the waiting rooms was tracked, as well as calls to inquire about smoking cessation studies.
