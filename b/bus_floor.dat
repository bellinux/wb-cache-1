25|$|The add-on side tent {{underwent}} a complete redesign. The new model (referred to in publicity materials as an Add-a-Room tent or a Motent) superficially resembles the late Split-windshield's framed tent in general shape and colors, but is otherwise quite different. For one, the tent's frame is now external, with the canvas supported by elastic loops and plastic hooks, somewhat like a shower curtain. Instead {{of a single}} opening front panel, there is a zippered screen door {{in the middle of}} the front (side away from the bus) with a small awning flap that can be lowered for wind and rain protection. This tent also features a waterproof floor, and the attachment method on the vehicle side results in a securely closable shelter (i.e., no more gap below the <b>bus</b> <b>floor).</b>|$|E

The reduction or elimination of the vehicle-to-platform gap is also key to customer safety and comfort. A range of measures can be used to achieve platform gaps of less than 5 cm, including guided busways at stations, alignment markers, Kassel curbs, and boarding bridges.|$|E

The bus will be electrically powered using overhead lines or other roof electrical contact systems designed for it, supplemented with photovoltaic panels, batteries, or supercapacitors on board. It will travel at up to 60 km/h. Different versions will carry up to [...] passengers, with the larger versions being articulated to facilitate going around curves. A working scale model of the now called Transit Explore Bus (TEB) was showcased at the 2016 Beijing International High-Tech Expo.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. After {{preliminary}} design of low floor front axle is finished, {{finite element analysis}} module of CATIA {{is used to calculate}} the distribution of stress field and displacement field of low floor front axle in the working conditions of vertical static loading, emergency braking as well as side slipping of bus, and then the conclusion will be reached to provide theory basis for front axle design of the whole project. Preface Most of city buses are two or three steps, the height of its floor is 600 mm～ 700 mm, for this kinds of buses, the common front axle can meet the challenge. With the development of urban transportation and the growth in the living standard, two or three steps buses have inconvenient problem for particular group and waste times to get up and down the bus. A city needs one step buses {{to meet the needs of}} all kinds of people. To achieve this requirement, the <b>bus</b> <b>floor</b> height should be lower. The <b>bus</b> <b>floor</b> height is about 360 mm～ 400 mm. To lower floor height means the space under the axle is to be decreased, as shown in fig. 1. To resolve this problem, the key is to design large fall low floor front axle and full-scale finite element analysis of the front axle. The paper analyzes the load conditions of vertical static of low floor front axle, emergenc...|$|E

40|$|Although the {{technological}} developments, the handicappeds {{do not take}} part sufficiently {{in the social and}} economic life, because buildings, road construction features and means of the transport are not suitable for them. In this study, a lift for handicappeds was designed, that is supposed to be installed to the middle door of city buses. The lift, whose installation should require a few changes at the bus, is driven by a hydraulic system from the street {{to the level of the}} <b>bus</b> <b>floor</b> and vice-versa. In the work, at first a construction was developed in accordance with the dimensions of the middle door of a city bus. After determining of dimensions of all elements, a hydraulic mechanism was constructed, that raises the handicapped, its wheelchair and the platform. Furthermore the construction of the elements of the system were determined, and its proofs of strength analysis were indicate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Floor {{vibration}} {{model was}} established by FEM and the modal analysis was conducted, which {{were based on the}} condition that this experiment took the automobile floor as the research object and applied the basic theory of finite element analysis. Simultaneously the results of modal analysis were compared with the results of the experiment, verifying the accuracy of the model. This can be considered as a basis of providing reference for the optimization and improvement of light <b>bus</b> <b>floor.</b> 1. Preface Floor is the loading-bearing part of a bus and is also an important part of transmitting the vibration of vehicle. Modal analysis is the basis of the vibration analysis[1]. However, there are little papers on the modal analysis of vehicle floor, and most papers are on the modal analysis of the frame and body of vehicle. During the process of car-moving, occupant seats would vibrate when there is severe floor vibration, which seriously affect the ride comfort of drivers and passengers. Improving floor vibration problems and reducing floor vibration can effectively raise the vehicle’s comfort. Currently the competition of auto industry becomes increasingly fierce, and improving ride comfort is an effective means to increase the competiveness of vehicle in the marke...|$|E

The viewer has no clue this was a vehicle of public transportation and the poles are the fragmented remains of a bus is encouraged to climb up the stairs. Soon, the viewer realizes the bright red climbing frame was a <b>bus's</b> <b>floor</b> and railings - the remains of a suicide bombing. Gil set out to show that the bus's remains, much like human remains, are cleaned up immediately after [...] "the event", leaving no indication as to what has happened.|$|R
