5|$|In 2006 and 2007, {{a number}} of {{leveraged}} buyout transactions were completed which, for the first time, surpassed the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price. The deal was first surpassed in July 2006 by the $33 billion buyout of U.S. hospital operator Hospital Corporation of America, in which KKR participated, though the RJR deal was larger, adjusted for inflation. However, adjusted for inflation, none of the leveraged buyouts of the 2006–07 period would surpass RJR Nabisco. The RJR transaction benefited many of the parties involved. Investment bankers and lawyers who advised KKR walked away with over $1 billion in fees. Kravis and Roberts attracted an unprecedented amount of publicity that turned the cousins into instant celebrities. Size did not, however, guarantee success as the high purchase price and debt load would <b>burden</b> <b>the</b> performance of the investment, which KKR overcame, raising a new investment fund and continuing to invest throughout the 1990s.|$|E

Even if the state imposed a tax of 25 or even 50 percent, creating an immediate, direct, consequential burden, Congress had the legislative power to ensure that such a tax did not hinder or unduly <b>burden</b> <b>the</b> federal government.|$|E

25|$|Even {{in areas}} of high prevalence, the {{frequency}} and severity of infection is not uniform within communities or families.

40|$|Objective: Psychosocial, {{emotional}} and physical responses arising while giving care is considered as <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of <b>the</b> caregiver. To be aware of <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> to <b>the</b> family members or caregivers and the severity of <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> provides important clues for family treatment. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of <b>the</b> caregivers of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia patients, the relationship of <b>the</b> caregiving <b>burden</b> with sociodemographic and psychopathological variables, and whether there is any similarities between the two groups with respect to caregiving <b>burden.</b> Methodology: <b>The</b> caregivers of 40 chronic bipolar patients and 40 schizophrenia patients diagnosed according to DSM-IV participated in this study. Patients’ symptoms were assessed with Clinical Global Impression Scale. Caregivers were evaluated using Zarit Burden Interview. Results: Caregiving burden was found high in the caregivers of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia patients, but there is no statistical difference between the groups. Educational status of the caregivers, the severity of the illness, caregiver’s relationship to the patient, a history of psychiatric disorder in the family were found as important variables that increased <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of <b>the</b> caregiver. Discussion: To uncover the factors that affect <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of <b>the</b> caregivers is important for predicting relapses. Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia significantly affect not only patients but also their families (or caregivers). At this stage, the responsibility of the clinician is not restricted to clinical practice, but includes educating patients and their families as well as helping them to organise against psychological and social difficulties...|$|R

25|$|Because {{this method}} of {{creating}} an easement requires imposing a <b>burden</b> (<b>the</b> easement) upon another party {{for the benefit of}} the landlocked owner, the court looks to the original circumstances in weighing the relative apportionment of benefit and burden to both lots in making its equitable determination whether such easement shall be created by the court. This method of creating an easement, being an active creation by a court of an otherwise non-existent right, may be automatically extinguished upon termination of the necessity (for example, if a new public road is built adjacent to the landlocked tenement or another easement is acquired without regard to comparison of ease or practicality between the imposed easement and any valid substitute).|$|E

Northern Rhodesia duly became an Imperial protectorate on 1 April 1924, with Sir Herbert Stanley installed as the inaugural governor.

Houston missed 32 games in 2003-04 due to a knee injury, and despite claims in the summer of 2004 that he would be ready to play the next season (he even refused to have surgery on his knee that summer), he played in only 20 games that season because his injury had not completely healed. Knee injuries would eventually force Houston to announce his retirement on October 17, 2005.|$|E

The presence of CD8+ T cells in cancer lesions, as identified using RNA sequencing data, is higher in tumors with a high mutational <b>burden.</b> <b>The</b> level of transcripts associated with cytolytic activity of natural killer cells and T cells positively correlates with mutational load in many human tumors. In non–small cell lung cancer patients treated with lambrolizumab, mutational load shows a strong correlation with clinical response. In melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, long-term benefit is also associated with a higher mutational load, although less significantly. The predicted MHC binding neoantigens in patients with a long-term clinical benefit were enriched {{for a series of}} tetrapeptide motifs that were not found in tumors of patients with no or minimal clinical benefit. However, human neoantigens identified in other studies do not show the bias toward tetrapeptide signatures.|$|E
