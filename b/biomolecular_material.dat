40|$|We present new {{results in}} {{physical}} analysis of acoustical SAW- based (Love- wave) resonators and magnetoelastic microsensors in biofluidic applications where the negligible amount of <b>biomolecular</b> <b>material</b> can be monitored in situ in a liquid phase. We reported the exact {{solution of the}} dispersion equation of surface acoustic waves (SAW) of Love type for the first type of resonators and demonstrate the importance of size effects in magnetoelastic resonators never taken into account before in such systems. Our results can readily {{be applied to the}} correct interpretation of resonance frequency and quality factor changes measured in various biofluidic applications. Our choice of the resonators has been motivated by the following. SAW-based microsensors operate at high frequency (up to GHz) which is a great benefit for monitoring of mass since the measurable signal, the shift in phase velocity ΔV/V, is ~ω. The Love wave polarization corresponds to the no-slip conditions for example, when the biomolecular coating material is covalently bound to the substrate. Magnetoelastic sensors is a type of acoustic resonance devices considered as the magnetic analog of SAW sensors. Besides of simple design, miniaturization and low cost of the magnetoelastic materials, the advantage of magnetoelastic resonators is a possibility of wireless remote measurements [1, 2]. Their working principle is based on a usage of magnetostrictive ribbon-shaped elements of a few mm in size as transducers that mechanically oscillate at a fundamental frequency when placed in ac magnetic field. Viscous- or mass loads cause a variation in the resonance frequency of the resonator. Simultaneous monitoring of the dissipation facto...|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{fabrication}} of micro-scale silver interconnecting wires using biological molecules (protein and DNA) served as templates {{has been successfully}} demonstrated. The combination of biomolecular templates with nano-size metal particles illustrates the capabilities of this approach to synthesize versatile electronic interconnecting wires. In the protein-templated approach, {{it started with a}} self-assembled β-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils developed from soluble hen egg white lysozyme. The highly soluble hen egg white lysozyme rapidly converted to form long fibrillar structures with a diameter of 10 nm when it associated with highly concentrated ethanol solution (90 %) or acidic solution (pH 2. 0) at elevated temperatures. The fibrillar protein templates were subsequently subject to silver ion impregnation and chemical reduction to drive the formation of protein-based silver strands which offered a useful and novel way for nano-electronic fabrications. In addition to the protein fibril approach, long-chain double-stranded DNA molecules appear to be another attractive <b>biomolecular</b> <b>material</b> used as templates for nano-structure fabrication. In this approach, the formation of silver wires involved the micro-manipulation of DNA molecules into one-dimensional pattern served as a scaffold followed by silver ion deposition in which the positive silver ions were attracted by the negatively charged DNA backbone. The {{fabrication of}} silver wires was then accomplished by silver ion reduction treatment using hydroquinone in both alkaline and acidic conditions. Electron micrographs show that the silver wires formed with DNA templates are of more than 10 μm long and approximately 300 - 500 nm in width. These achievements suggest a useful way of using a template-directed approach to convert natural biomolecules to metallic silver wires which provide applications in electronic industry...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: Sensitive and {{selective}} molecular recognition is important throughout biology. Certain organisms and toxins use specific binding at the cell surface {{as a first}} step towards invasion. A new series of <b>biomolecular</b> <b>materials,</b> with novel optical and interfacial properties, have been designed to sense molecular recognition events. These polymers, the diacetylenic lipids, have previously been shown to undergo chromatic transitions in response to virus binding {{to the surface of the}} material. Results: Gangliosides that specifically bind cholera toxin, heat-labile Escherichia coli enterotoxin and botulinum neurotoxin were incorporated into a matrix of diacetylenic lipids, 5 – 10 % of which were derivatized with sialic acid. The lipids were self-assembled into Langmuir-Blodgett layers and polymerized with ultraviolet irradiation, yielding a polydiacetylene membrane with a characteristic blue color into which the ganglioside is non-covalently incorporated. When toxin is added, the polymerized membrane turns red. The response is specific {{and selective}}, and can be quantified by visible absorption spectrophotometry. Conclusions: Polydiacetylenic lipid membranes offer a general ‘litmus test’ for molecular recognition at the surface of a membrane.

Observing that many of these solutions are multiscale hierarchical structures comprised of nature’s building block, the cell, a new class of stimuli-responsive materials is proposed based on cellular capabilities.

The simulation work presented in this thesis aims to facilitate the interpretation of experimental data and to provide detailed structural and dynamic information of protein models inaccessible by experiments. ^ Several synthetic protein models have been investigated in this thesis. Firstly, the structure and dynamics of a de novo designed amphiphilic 4 -α-helix bundle protein model capable of binding biological metallo-porphyrin cofactors are examined. The simulation results are {{in agreement with the}} experimental structural determinations available at lower resolution and limited dimension.

The simplified model allows for more sophisticated physical techniques, such as infrared spectroscopy, to be used. MD simulation correctly predicts the infrared frequency shift of the vibrational probes at the binding site in the presence of anesthetics.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} is to create robust artificial protein modules as scaffolds to control both (a) the conformation of novel cofactors incorporated into the modules thereby making the modules possess a desired functionality and (b) the organization of these functional modules into ordered macroscopic ensembles, whose macroscopic materials properties derive from the designed microscopic function of the modules. We focus on two specific types of cofactors for imparting functionality in this project; primarily nonlinear optical (NLO) chromophores designed to exhibit extraordinary molecular hyperpolarizabilities, as well as donor-bridge-acceptor cofactors designed to exhibit highly efficient, 'through-bonds' light-induced electron transfer (LIET) over nano-scale distances. The ensembles range from 2 -D to 3 -D, designed to possess the degree of orientational and positional order necessary to optimize their macroscopic response, the latter ranging from liquid-crystalline or glass-like to long-range periodic. Computational techniques, firmly based in statistical thermodynamics, are utilized for the design the artificial protein modules, based on robust {alpha}-helical bundle motifs, necessarily incorporating the desired conformation, location, and environment of the cofactor. Importantly, this design approach also includes optimization of the interactions between the modules to promote their organization into ordered macroscopic ensembles in 2 -D and 3 -D via either directed-assembly or self-assembly. When long-range periodic order is required, the design can be optimized to result a specified lattice symmetry. The structure and functionality of the individual modules are fully characterized at the microscopic level, {{as well as that}} of the ensembles at the macroscopic level, employing modern experimental physical-chemical and computational techniques. These include, for example, multi-dimensional NMR, various pump-probe transient spectroscopies to ultrafast time-scales, and hyper-Rayleigh scattering at the microscopic level, and synchrotron radiation-based x-ray scattering and x-ray spectroscopy, cold neutron scattering, molecular dynamics simulation, and optical harmonic generation at the macroscopic level. This overall approach has some distinct advantages, compared to more traditional approaches, for example, those based on organic polymers, biopolymers or undressed cofactors. The resulting functional ensembles thereby have potential for important device applications in the areas of optical communications and photovoltaics.

40|$|Markov state models (MSMs) {{and other}} related kinetic network models are {{frequently}} used to study the long-timescale dynamical behavior of <b>biomolecular</b> and <b>materials</b> systems. MSMs are often constructed bottom-up using brute-force molecular dynamics (MD) simulations when the model contains {{a large number of}} states and kinetic pathways that are not known a priori. However, the resulting network generally encompasses only parts of the configurational space, and regardless of any additional MD performed, several states and pathways will still remain missing. This implies that the duration for which the MSM can faithfully capture the true dynamics, which we term as the validity time for the MSM, is always finite and unfortunately much shorter than the MD time invested to construct the model. A general framework that relates the kinetic uncertainty in the model to the validity time, missing states and pathways, network topology, and statistical sampling is presented. Performing additional calculations for frequently-sampled states/pathways may not alter the MSM validity time. A new class of enhanced kinetic sampling techniques is introduced that aims at targeting rare states/pathways that contribute most to the uncertainty so that the validity time is boosted in an effective manner.

The realization of highresolution master structures by {{electron beam lithography}} (EBL) and their transfer to different organic functional materials by mechanical lithographies allow to fully exploit the wide flexibility of molecular systems for opto- and nanoelectronic devices. Planar nanojunctions, consisting of two metallic electrodes separated by an insulating medium, permit to test the molecular conduction properties. Since the typical size of a biomolecule is {{of the order of}} a few nanometer, hybrid molecular electronic (HME) devices need metallic electrodes separated by a nanometer-scale channel.

Moreover, we developed a number of mechanical patterning methods, including soft hot embossing, rapid prototyping, sub-micrometer fluidics, high- and room-temperature nanoimprinting, to fabricate planar nanostructures on both <b>biomolecular</b> and organic <b>materials.</b> These allowed us a high-fidelity pattern transfer up to 100 -nm scale resolution, without reducing the emission yields of light-emitting organics, thus opening the way to the one-step realization of organic-based confined optoelectronic devices...|$|R
