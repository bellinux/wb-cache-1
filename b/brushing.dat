25|$|Large <b>brushes</b> are desired for {{a larger}} <b>brush</b> contact area to {{maximize}} motor output, but small <b>brushes</b> are desired for low mass to maximize {{the speed at which}} the motor can run without the <b>brushes</b> excessively bouncing and sparking.

40|$|Polyelectrolyte <b>brushes</b> are polymer <b>brushes</b> with charged {{units on}} polymer chains. Due to the {{responsive}} properties of polyelectrolyte <b>brushes,</b> they have large applications in many fields. This thesis describes the synthetic approaches of growing polyelectrolyte <b>brushes</b> {{in a controlled}} way. The majority of this thesis focuses {{on the study of}} applying controlled living radical polymerisation methods on surface-initiated polymerisation, aiming to achieve controlled growth of polyelectrolyte <b>brush,</b> e. g. controlled <b>brush</b> thickness, grafting density, and internal structure of the <b>brush.</b> Atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP), activators (re) generated electron transfer (A(R) GET) ATRP and single electron-transfer living radical polymerisation (SET-LRP) have been studied systematically on the synthesis of polyelectrolyte <b>brushes</b> from surface. These polyelectrolyte <b>brushes</b> are studied using ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and contact angle goniometry. During the study, a unique property of the polyzwitterionic <b>brush</b> is found and explored.

40|$|AbstractThe rapid advancements {{in various}} current {{technologies}} {{and the constant}} trend in miniaturizing of components have created a need for higher cleanliness levels. Contamination {{in the level of}} monolayers can drastically alter surface properties such as wettability, adhesion, optical or electrical characteristics. To select an effective cleaning method the three essential factors to be considered such as cleaning chemistry, the scrubbing method and other process parameters. This study investigates the effectiveness of <b>brush</b> cleaning, ultrasonic cleaning and combination of <b>brush</b> and ultrasonic cleaning on removal of contamination, surface defects and <b>brush</b> life time. In this study, the cleaning efficiency was compared for the parts cleaned with ultrasonics, nylon <b>brush,</b> Poly Vinyl Alcohol (PVA) <b>brush</b> and combination of ultrasonics and nylon <b>brush.</b> The life time of <b>brush</b> was studied for both nylon and PVA <b>brush.</b> The techniques used to identify the contamination are SEM, EDX and optical microscope. The microscopic result indicates that the removal efficiency was high for the parts cleaned with ultrasonics (90. 5 %) and PVA <b>brush</b> (90. 2 %) as compared to Nylon <b>brush</b> (77. 4 %). This {{is due to the fact}} that for PVA <b>brush</b> the fluid was being pumped in and out of <b>brush</b> pores (during compression and elastic recovery of the <b>brush),</b> carries the contamination away from the surface and also the contact area between the contamination surface and <b>brush</b> was more. From Liquid Particle Count (LPC) analysis, the > 0. 3 mic particle counts is almost two times lower for parts cleaned with ultrasonics as compared to parts cleaned with <b>brushes.</b> This indicates that 58 / 132 kHz washing followed by 470 kHz DI rinsing effectively removes sub- micron particles from the surface compared to <b>brush</b> cleaning. The defects caused by <b>brushes</b> on the surface of the slider bar is almost 1 % for nylon <b>brush</b> cleaning, 0. 4 % for PVA <b>brush</b> cleaning and 0 % for ultrasonic cleaning. From experimental study, it can be seen that the life time of PVA <b>brush</b> was shorter than Nylon <b>brush</b> by 75 times. The contamination increased after 50 th run for PVA <b>brush</b> and after 700 th run for nylon <b>brush.</b> This is due to the fact that after <b>brush</b> damage (after 50 th run for PVA and 700 th run for nylon) the <b>brush</b> can not effectively remove the contamination and also re-deposition of contamination from <b>brush...</b>|$|R

5|$|Honeyeaters {{are clearly}} the most {{important}} pollination vector, as inflorescences from which honeyeaters are excluded generally do not set any fruit. Moreover, honeyeaters have been observed moving {{from tree to tree}} with significant loads of B.sessilis pollen on their foreheads, beaks and throats, having acquired it by <b>brushing</b> against pollen presenters while foraging for nectar; experiments have shown that some of this pollen may be subsequently deposited on stigmas during later foraging.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Claudette was {{the third}} {{tropical}} storm and first hurricane of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. A fairly long-lived July Atlantic hurricane, Claudette began as a tropical wave in the eastern Caribbean. It moved quickly westward, <b>brushing</b> past the Yucatán Peninsula before moving northwestward through the Gulf of Mexico. Claudette remained a tropical storm until just before making landfall in Port O'Connor, Texas, when it quickly strengthened to a strong Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Forecasting of its path and intensity was uncertain throughout its lifetime, resulting in widespread and often unnecessary preparations along its path.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Henri {{developed}} as Tropical Depression Eighteen {{in the extreme}} northwestern Caribbean Sea on September 14 from a tropical wave, which had previously moved {{off the coast of}} Africa.

After reaching the Gulf of Mexico it turned sharply westward, with a ridge preventing further northward movement. The depression turned southwestward, and intensified into Tropical Storm Henri on September 16.|$|E

50|$|A {{pinstriping}} <b>brush</b> is {{the tool}} of traditional free hand pinstripers use for pinstriping. Freehand pinstriping {{is the most}} difficult method of pinstriping and the <b>brush</b> is an important tool for design. Pinstriping <b>brushes</b> have several different designs, Swords, Daggers, and Flats, as well as Double line <b>brushes.</b> The <b>brush</b> consists of a small wood dowel handle, string or brass fixture with adhesive and <b>brush</b> hairs traditionally made from squirrel hair (confusingly called camel hair). The small wood dowel is balanced so pinstripers can freely spin the <b>brush</b> between their fingers. The dowel's short length is so the <b>brush</b> does not hit the palm of the hand while the <b>brush</b> is placed in-between the index finger and thumb. The hair of a pinstriping <b>brush</b> is relatively long at approximately 2 inches,or more, compared to most artistic <b>brushes</b> of a similar size. This long length is to hold the necessary amount of paint to pull a long line.|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Paine {{contributed to}} one of the most {{significant}} flooding events in Oklahoma history. The 16th tropical storm and 8th hurricane of the 1986 Pacific hurricane season, Paine formed on September 28 off the southeast coast of Mexico.

Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.|$|E
40|$|Polymer <b>brushes</b> are {{commonly}} used to modify the properties of solid surfaces. Here a family of polybasic poly(2 -(diethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) <b>brushes</b> have been grown using ARGET ATRP from a cationic macroinitiator adsorbed on two types of silica surfaces: QCM crystals and oxidised silicon wafers. The pH-response of these <b>brushes</b> is investigated {{as a function of}} <b>brush</b> thickness in a constant flow environment in order to focus on the intrinsic dynamics of the polymer <b>brushes.</b> Independent QCM-D and in situ ellipsometry kinetic studies demonstrate the swelling process of protonation and solvent uptake is typically eight times faster than the corresponding neutralisation and solvent expulsion from the collapsing <b>brush.</b> However, the maximum rate of these processes is independent of <b>brush</b> thickness. The initial pH response of the <b>brushes</b> is hysteretic due to <b>brush</b> entanglement, which once overcome allows highly reversible pH-induced conformational changes. Multiple pH cycles demonstrate that the viscoelastic nature of the swollen state relative to the collapsed <b>brush</b> is independent of <b>brush</b> thickness...|$|R
