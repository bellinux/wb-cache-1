She sailed for Cardiff, {{becoming the first}} ship depending only on pulverized coal to cross the Atlantic, and back to Baltimore on 18 August. Early results showed {{that in addition to}} making the transatlantic crossings about 10% faster than she had before, West Alsek used about 30% less coal during the voyage. West Alsek continued to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> platform for assessing the pulverized coal system during a voyage to Glasgow, her second for the Oriole Line.|$|E
5|$|In 1825 Hogg {{accompanied}} {{his brother}} John {{on a tour}} of Continental Europe. Jane encouraged him to take the trip, believing that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> of his commitment to her. He returned to England in February 1826. Although Hogg enjoyed the trip, he missed reading Greek literature and English newspapers. Writing the journals that were published in 1827 under the title Two Hundred and Nine Days occupied much of his time during the trip. He frequently attacked the Catholic Church and customs officials in his journals, but he often made positive observations about the lifestyles of many of the ordinary people that he met. Hogg also recounted his visit to the grave of Percy Shelley in Italy.|$|E

The character was voiced by Harry Hamlin in God of War II, who was chosen due to his previous portrayal of the character in the 1981 film Clash of the Titans.|$|E

They <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> of credibility for the country as a whole, to indicate to its European partners that it was able to achieve the political stability essential to Italy’s economic recovery.

5|$|Hutton captained the England Test team between 1952 and 1955, {{although}} his leadership was at times controversial. He pursued a cautious approach and faced criticism for negativity. Never {{comfortable in the}} role, Hutton felt that the former amateur players who administered and governed English cricket did not trust him. In 23 Tests as captain, he won eight Tests and lost four with the others drawn. Worn out by the mental and physical demands of his role, Hutton retired from regular first-class cricket during the 1955 season. Knighted for his contributions to cricket in 1956, {{he went on to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Test</b> selector, a journalist and broadcaster. He also worked as a representative for an engineering firm until retiring from the job in 1984. Hutton remained involved in cricket, and became president of Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1990. He died a few months afterwards in September 1990, aged 74.|$|E

He saw Darwin’s theory of natural selection not as flawed, but as incomplete. He felt {{that if he were}} to provide a concrete demonstration of how sexual selection {{played a role in the}} reproductive success of certain species, he could explain the gap between Darwin’s ideas and sexual dimorphism.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} Iblis is also {{considered}} as an adversary to humans spiritual development, in some Sufi traditions from Al Hallaj, he represents a true monotheist and {{is regarded as}} a master of oneness. By accepting a penalty for disobience, he affirmed the oneness of God, erased the illusion of duality (good and evil) and represents a selfless believer and therefore a true lover of God. Actually, the command, prostating before Adam, is considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> of love, rather than a real command. Additionally Iblis as the devil, teaches evil among the earthly beings, so they learn to recognize good.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{its earlier}} involvement, the Discovery Institute was {{concerned}} that this would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> case and that the defendants had earlier displayed their religious motivations. This tension led to disagreements with the Thomas More Law Center and the withdrawal of three Discovery Institute fellows as defense experts prior to their depositions– William A. Dembski, Stephen C. Meyer and John Angus Campbell. This was purportedly because the Thomas More Law Center refused to allow these witnesses {{to have their own}} attorneys present during deposition, but Discovery Institute director Bruce Chapman later said that he had asked them not to testify (as well as Behe and Minnich, who testified anyway).|$|E

McCain, Giuliani and Romney were closely matched in pre-election polls, and the contest was seen as {{important}} to each campaign, as it was the last primary before Super Tuesday, when 41% of the total delegates were up for grabs. It was also the first time that Rudy Giuliani would seriously compete for delegates since a partial effort in New Hampshire, and the first primary after Fred Thompson withdrew his candidacy.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{on leaving}} the Army, Hutchison pitched into the {{political}} world as Conservative candidate in Glasgow Central. The previous election had seen a relatively narrow Conservative majority of 3,521, and was regarded as close enough to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> of opinion among the Glasgow business community. Conservative Party leader Winston Churchill (who was somewhat late arriving) addressed a mass meeting at Blythswood Square in the division and received a warm reception from a large crowd. In {{the circumstances of the}} election (where the Conservatives lost 180 seats), Hutchison did well to win by 1,516 although the swing in Glasgow was much less than elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|On August 12, 1996, Mayne Queen {{departed}} Swartz Bay {{terminal and}} ran aground off Piers Island after losing steering control. The grounding occurred while performing a regular weekly {{test of the}} batteries for the steering control system. A crew member overheard {{there was going to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>test,</b> and in an attempt to be helpful and without direction, cut all power from the vessel's steering batteries, as he had done at night when the ship was stored, not realizing that the test in question only required the removal of a battery charger and that his assistance was neither requested nor required. No one was injured in the incident, and the vessel was assisted off the rocks at high tide, but it suffered extensive damage to its propulsion system, having two of the four steering and propulsion pods for the right-angle drives sheared off and one of the two remaining pods suffering propeller damage.|$|E
25|$|When he returned, however, Cook - now bowling at {{a slower}} pace than in 1911 - {{immediately}} became, for the first time, indispensable to Lancashire. Although he still failed to achieve much against strong counties, he did a notable performance against Gloucestershire with nine for 49, and was second in the Lancashire bowling averages. 1920, however, saw Cook jump right {{to the top of the}} tree with 156 first-class wickets for less than fifteen runs each, and some notable performances in tandem with Harry Dean and Cecil Parkin, notably against Kent at Old Trafford in July. Although he did not have the honour of representing the Players or touring Australia, Cook would no doubt have been chosen as a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden but for the special portrait of Pelham Warner to commemorate Middlesex's Championship win. In the dry summer of 1921, Cook showed himself to be one of the most tireless and consistent workhorses in county cricket, even if no selector thought he had enough sting to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Test</b> match bowler. He took 151 wickets without one haul of seven in an innings, and in 1922 he maintained his accuracy and spin notably when taking seven for 23 on a crumbling pitch.|$|E
25|$|The {{reign of}} Francis II was notable {{in many respects}} {{including}} two wars against Charles VIII of France, {{both of which were}} lost, the establishment of the Parlement of Brittany, and the death of all of his children save for his daughter Anne of Brittany. Francis II's rule as Duke was also marked by continued intrigues with the House of Penthièvre. Joan of Penthièvre's later descendants, the Brosse line of the House of Penthièvre through Jean de Brosse, were denied their claims to the Ducal Crown in the 15th Century possibly as an alteration of the rules of inheritance by the then Duke of Brittany, Francis II. The wars with France eventually cost Ducal Brittany its independence, while the Parlement ensured a degree of autonomy that would continue through the reign of Louis XIV of France. That Francis II's sole heir was his daughter Anne assured an inheritance contest on his death that would pit the power of the House of Montfort against conflicting treaty obligations to the House of Penthièvre in Brittany, and the House of Valois in France, and would also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> of the Breton tradition of semi-Salic law in which a daughter could be the principal inheritor. The position of the King of France dominated these events through two wars. After the first war, under the Treaty of Verger, the marriage of Francis II's sole surviving issue, Anne, would need to be approved by the King of France.|$|E
