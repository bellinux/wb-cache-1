Our participants were randomized into 2 groups, 1 which received nutritional advice alone and 1 that also received vouchers that were exchangeable for <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> during a 12 -mo period. Socioeconomic characteristics, food insufficiency, affordability, and motivation for eating <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> were assessed. A short FFQ was administered. Determinants of consumption of < 1 fruit or vegetable/d were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. A total of 295 participants were included (mean age 44. 8 y; 133 men, 162 women). At baseline, mean daily consumption of <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> was 2. 13 +/- 1. 57 times/d. Nearly 30 % of the sample did not eat <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> every day. Determinants of low <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption were: age younger than 55 y, education level lower than tertiary, and absence of financial means for buying <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> daily. Other determinants were affordability (whether <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> are affordable, lack of money in preventing healthy diet) and attitudes (whether one's own diet is healthy, whether or not <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> improve health, whether eating <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> is a pleasure).

OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of the current}} study was to examine whether early feeding practices influence later <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake in preschool children. DESIGN: The study used data from 4 European cohorts: the British Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), the French Etude des Déterminants pre et postnatals de la santé et du développement de l'Enfant study, the Portuguese Generation XXI Birth Cohort, and the Greek EuroPrevall study. <b>Fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake was assessed in each cohort by food-frequency questionnaire. Associations between early feeding practices, such as breastfeeding and timing of complementary feeding, <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> and/or <b>vegetable</b> intake in 2 - 4 -y-old children were tested by using logistic regressions, separately in each cohort, after adjustment for infant's age and sex and maternal age, educational level, smoking during pregnancy, <b>and</b> maternal <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake. RESULTS: Large differences in early feeding practices were highlighted across the 4 European cohorts with longer breastfeeding duration in the Generation XXI Birth Cohort and earlier introduction to complementary foods in ALSPAC. Longer breastfeeding duration was consistently related to higher <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake in young children, whereas the associations with age of introduction to <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake were weaker and less consistent across the cohorts.

Methods—This was a prospective, population-based cohort study, including 20 069 men and women age 20 to 65 years and free of cardiovascular diseases at baseline. Participants completed a validated, 178 -item food frequency questionnaire. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated for stroke incidence using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for age, sex, lifestyle, and dietary factors. Results—During 10 years of follow-up, 233 incident cases of stroke were documented. <b>Fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> were classified into 4 color groups. Medians of green, orange/yellow, red/purple, <b>and</b> white <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption were 62, 87, 57, and 118 g/d, respectively.

Children's <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption was measured using a valid and reliable subscale from the Children's Dietary Questionnaire. Associations were investigated between children's <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake and characteristics of the home food environment including parental role-modeling, parental providing behaviour, <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> availability, <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> accessibility, pressure to eat, family eating policies and family mealtime practices. Characteristics of the home food environment that showed evidence of an association with children's <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption in simple regression models were entered into a backwards stepwise multiple regression analysis. The multiple regression analysis used generalised linear mixed models, controlled for parental education, household income and child gender, and was adjusted for the correlation between children's <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption within a preschool. Results The multiple regression analysis found positive associations between children's <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption <b>and</b> parental <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake (p = 0. 005), <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> availability (p = 0. 006) and accessibility (p = 0. 012), the number of occasions each day that parents provided their child with <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> (p Conclusions This study identified a range of modifiable characteristics within the home food environment that are associated with <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption among preschool children.

40|$|Low-income Americans consume fewer total <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> daily {{than the}} average for Americans of all incomes. <b>Fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> {{consumption}} by the poor is affected by many factors, including access, availability, cost, taste, convenience, and perishability. Cost is of higher relative importance to low-income Americans {{than the rest of}} the population. In 2000, low-income households spent less money per person on <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> than wealthier Americans but spent a similar percentage of their at-home food budget on <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables.</b> This suggests that the poor are not sacrificing <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> expenditures in order to purchase other types of food at home but rather spend less money on <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> at home because they spend less money on total food at home.

40|$|Early {{childhood}} {{is critical to}} the development of lifelong food habits. Given the high proportion of children with inadequate <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption, identification of modifiable factors associated with higher consumption may be useful in developing interventions to address this public health issue. This study aimed to identify the characteristics of the home food environment that are associated with higher <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption in a sample of Australian preschool children. A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted with 396 parents of 3 to 5 year-old children attending 30 preschools within the Hunter region, New South Wales, Australia. Children's <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption was measured using a valid and reliable subscale from the Children's Dietary Questionnaire. Associations were investigated between children's <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake and characteristics of the home food environment including parental role-modeling, parental providing behaviour, <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> availability, <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> accessibility, pressure to eat, family eating policies and family mealtime practices.

The multiple regression analysis used generalised linear mixed models, controlled for parental education, household income and child gender, and was adjusted for the correlation between children's <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption within a preschool. The multiple regression analysis found positive associations between children's <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption <b>and</b> parental <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake (p = 0. 005), <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> availability (p = 0. 006) and accessibility (p = 0. 012), the number of occasions each day that parents provided their child with <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> (p < 0. 001), and allowing children to eat only at set meal times all or most of the time (p = 0. 006). Combined, these characteristics of the home food environment accounted for 48 % of the variation in the child's <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> score.

S. adults – analysis of the food attitudes and behaviors survey (Under the direction of DR. KYMBERLE STERLING) High dietary intake of <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> (FVs) {{is associated with a}} lower risk for chronic disease including certain cancers, optimal child growth, and weight management. More than 72 million U. S. adults are obese; therefore, <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake is important in weight management. Using data from the Food Attitude and Behavior survey, this study will address the following questions: is there a correlation between recalled <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake during childhood <b>and</b> adult <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake among U. S. adults? Secondly, is reported <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption associated with sociodemographic variables and other health-related behaviors? Results indicated there is a positive correlation between recalled FV intake and reported FV intake in adults. Therefore, public health practitioners should develop initiatives {{to increase the amount of}} FV intake in children so that these FV consumption habits may continue in adulthood...|$|R
