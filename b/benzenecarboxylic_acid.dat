40|$|Natural {{organic matter}} (NOM) {{is a highly}} active {{component}} of soils and sediments, and {{plays an important role}} in global C cycling. However, NOM has defied molecular-level structural characterization, owing to variations along the decomposition continuum and its existence as highly functionalized polyelectrolytes. We conducted a comprehensive systematic overview of spectral signatures and peak positions of major organic molecules that occur as part of NOM using near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. The spectra of carbohydrates and amino sugars show resonances between 289. 10 and 289. 59 eV, attributed to 1 s- 3 p/* transitions of O-alkyl (C-OH) moieties. They also exhibited distinct peaks between 288. 42 and 288. 74 eV, representing C 1 s–*C = O transition from COOH functionalities. Amino acids produced a strong signal around 288. 70 eV, which can be identified as a C 1 s–*C=O transition of carboxyl/carbonyl (COOH/COO-) structures. Spectral features near 285. 29 eV were ascribed to C 1 s–*C=C transition of ring structure of aromatic amino acids, while spectra between 287. 14 and 287. 86 eV were attributed to C 1 s–*C-H and C 1 s–*C-H/ 3 p Rydberg-like excitations from CH and CH 2 groups. Phenols and benzoquinone produced strong resonances between 285. 08 and 285. 37 eV, attributed to the * orbital of C (C 1 s–*C=C) atoms connected to either C or H (C–H) in the aromatic ring. The next higher excitation common to both phenols and quinone appeared between 286. 05 and 286. 35 eV, and could be associated with C 1 s–*C=C transitions of aromatic C bonded to O atom in phenols, and to C 1 s–*C=O transitions from aromatic C connected to O atom (C-OH) in phenols or to a C=O in p-benzoquinone and some phenols with carbonyl structures, respectively. Nucleobases exhibited complex spectral features with pronounced resonances between 286. 02 and 286. 84 eV and between 288. 01 and 288. 70 eV. Molecular markers for black C (<b>benzenecarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> and biphenyl- 4, 4 '-dicarboxylic acid) exhibit sharp absorption bands between 285. 01 and at 285. 43 eV, possibly from C 1 s–*C=C transition characteristic of C-H sites or unsaturated C (C=C) on aromatic ring structures. These aromatic carboxylic acids also exhibit broad peaks between 288. 35 and 288. 48 eV, reflecting C 1 s–*C=O transition of carboxyl functional groups bonded to unsaturated C. This investigation provides a more comprehensive NEXAFS spectral library of biogeochemically relevant organic C compounds. The spectra of these reference organic compounds reveal distinct spectral features and peak positions at the C K-edge that are characteristic of the molecular orbitals bonding C atoms. Detailed structural information can be derived from these distinctive spectral features that could be used to build robust peak assignment criteria to exploit the chemical sensitivity of NEXAFS spectroscopy for in situ molecular-level spatial investigation and fingerprinting of complex organic C compounds in environmental samples...|$|E

Both methods yielded phenols, methoxyphenols, <b>benzenecarboxylic</b> <b>acids,</b> alkanoic acids and hydrocarbons, but their relative amounts differed among the samples {{and for each}} sample depending on the degradation method. In relative quantitative terms, and {{when compared with the}} results obtained by 13 C NMR, it was observed that the use of TMAH led to an 'aliphatic enhancement', the extent inversely depending of temperature.

It is suggested that transesterification and base-catalysed hydrolysis reactions occurring at a sub-pyrolysis temperature could be a successful method of mild, low-temperature alkaline degradation, but it is not sufficient for obtaining stoichiometrically representative information on the molecular assemblages of the HA structure.

40|$|Five chiral {{inducers}} were synthesized with l-borneol and <b>benzenecarboxylic</b> <b>acids.</b> These chiral inducers {{have the}} same substituent (bornyl ester) but different geometries. Para-substituted chiral inducer (I-p) shows relatively high macroscopic helical twisting power (βM), while ortho-substituted chiral inducer (I-o) shows lower. This difference is related with the geometric similarity between the chiral inducers and the host liquid crystals. The result also suggested that distortion of π system induced by polar solvents causes low βM of the I-o. Optically active poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) films were chemically prepared in cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) electrolyte solution induced by the chiral inducers. Circular dichroism (CD) intensities of the resultant polymer films are almost proportional to helical twisting power (HTP) of the chiral inducers. Optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) spectra of the polymer film prepared in the CLC electrolyte induced by I-p (PF-para) shows isosbestic point during the oxidation.

Loss of carbohydrates, removal of methoxyls and formation of catechols during the coalification process was evident.

A very striking feature was the release of benzenecarboxylic moieties after pyrolysis-methylation which have not been observed previously by pyrolytic techniques. These moieties were released in higher amounts from the lignite HA, suggesting that the content in carboxylic groups increase with coalification, at least up to the lignite stage.

Protection of functional groups by simultaneous pyrolysis and methylation yielded pyrolysates in which methyl esters of fatty acids, aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, abietic acids, phenolic <b>acids</b> and <b>benzenecarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> were represented. However, methylation was not complete, and unmethylated compounds were also present. Spectra showed differences in humic acid composition between size separates as well as across land use regimes. The abundance of lignin-derived pyrolysis products increased with decreasing particle size, and was greater in soil under spruce than in soil under grass. Also, the lipid components differed, with hexadecanoic and docosanoic acid methyl esters being the dominant compounds in humic acids from soil under spruce and hexadecanoic and octadecanoic acid methyl esters in the humic acids from grassland. A good correlation was found between previous 13 C NMR and wet chemical data and pyrolysis data, indicating that pyrolysis-methylation {{can be used for}} fast detailed chemical characterization of humic acids extracted from size separates.

40|$|The organic {{fraction}} of black crusts from Saint Denis Basilica, France, {{is composed of}} a complex mixture of aliphatic and aromatic compounds. These compounds were studied by two different analytical approaches: tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) thermochemolysis in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and solvent extraction, fractionation by silica column, and identification of the fraction components by GC-MS. The first approach, feasible at the microscale level, is able to supply fairly general information {{on a wide range}} of compounds. Using the second approach, we were able to separate the complex mixture of compounds into four fractions, enabling a better identification of the extractable compounds. These compounds belong to different classes: aliphatic hydrocarbons (n-alkanes, n-alkenes), aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids (n-fatty acids, α,ω-dicarboxylic <b>acids,</b> and <b>benzenecarboxylic</b> <b>acids),</b> polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and molecular biomarkers (isoprenoid hydrocarbons, diterpenoids, and triterpenoids).

Changes {{in the composition of}} free lipids reflected vegetation types, whereas HAs analysed by visible and 13 C NMR spectroscopy, sodium perborate degradation and Curie-point pyrolysis indicated the extent of structural alteration of lignin in soil. The molecular fractions released by degradation techniques applied to HAs showed that demethoxylation and oxidation were associated with the removal of forest vegetation, and the aromatic compounds consisted mainly of methoxyphenols and <b>benzenecarboxylic</b> <b>acids.</b> Decreased concentration of alkanes and increased amounts of alcohols were observed after removal of forests. The chain lengths of alkyl compounds also tended to decrease. In forest soil, there was a series of diterpene resin acids, whereas in pasture soil steroids from animal origin and a root-derived triterpenoids with friedelan structure were found. In relation to the total quantity and quality of soil C, the overall chemical descriptors indicated that clearing and cultivation (semiarid cereal fields) lead to intense mineralization of SOM (mainly particulate, free organic matter) but the residual humic substances have enhanced maturity in terms of structural condensation and potential resilience.

40|$|GC-MS on the Viking 1976 Mars {{missions}} did {{not detect}} organic molecules on the Martian surface, even those expected from meteorite bombardment. This result {{suggested that the}} Martian regolith might hold a potent oxidant that converts all organic molecules to carbon dioxide rapidly relative to {{the rate at which}} they arrive. This conclusion is influencing the design of Mars missions. We reexamine this conclusion in light of what is known about the oxidation of organic compounds generally and the nature of organics likely to come to Mars via meteorite. We conclude that nonvolatile salts of <b>benzenecarboxylic</b> <b>acids,</b> and perhaps oxalic and acetic acid, should be metastable intermediates of meteoritic organics under oxidizing conditions. Salts of these organic acids would have been largely invisible to GC-MS. Experiments show that one of these, benzenehexacarboxylic acid (mellitic acid), is generated by oxidation of organic matter known to come to Mars, is rather stable to further oxidation, and would not have been easily detected by the Viking experiments. Approximately 2 kg of meteorite-derived mellitic acid may have been generated per m 2 of Martian surface over 3 billion years. How much remains depends on decomposition rates under Martian conditions. As available data do not require that the surface of Mars be very strongly oxidizing, some organic molecules might be found near the surface of Mars, perhaps in amounts sufficient to be a resource. Missions should seek these and recognize that these complicate the search for organics from entirely hypothetical Martian life...|$|R
40|$|A {{heterogeneous}} complexation model {{approach has}} been developed to describe the adsorption of large organic molecules by goethite taking the full speciation of the adsorbed molecules into account. The essence of the model is the calculation of the mean mode of an adsorbed organic molecule, defined by an overall affinity, charge distribution, and reaction stoichiometry. The calculation of the mean mode of the adsorbed organic molecule {{is based on the}} pH-dependent interaction of a functional group for binding a proton or forming an inner or outer sphere complex with specific surface sites. The distribution of the organic molecules over the solid and solution phases is calculated using the CD-MUSIC model with parameters obtained from the mean mode of the adsorbed molecule. The mean mode of the adsorbed molecule is calculated using the competitive Langmuir or NICCA equation in combination with an electrostatic model comprising charge distribution, taking the competitive binding of functional groups with protons or surface sites into account. The new model is applied to the adsorption data of a series of <b>benzenecarboxylic</b> <b>acids.</b> The model approach can describe simultaneously the concentration, pH, and salt dependency of the benzenecarboxylate adsorption. Furthermore, the model is applied to describe data obtained from IR spectroscopy. The new approach predicts the data reasonably well using only three adjustable parameters in case of the NICCA-CD-MUSIC approach. The average stoichiometry of the overall reaction is not an input parameter of the model but is an output parameter.

40|$|Black carbon (BC), {{produced}} by incomplete combustion {{of fossil fuels}} and vegetation, occurs ubiquitously in soils and sediments. BC exists as a continuum from partly charred material to highly graphitized soot particles, with no general agreement on clear-cut boundaries of definition or analysis. In a comparative analysis, we measured BC forms in eight soil samples by six established methods. All methods involved removal of the non-BC components from the sample by thermal or chemical means {{or a combination of}} both. The remaining carbon, operationally defined as BC, was quantified via mass balance, elemental composition or by exploiting <b>benzenecarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> as molecular markers or applying C- 13 MAS NMR (magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy. BC concentrations measured for individual samples vary over 2 orders of magnitude (up to a factor of 571). One possible explanation for this wide range of results is that the individual BC methods rely on operational definitions with clearcut but different boundaries and developed for specific scientific questions, whereas BC represents a continuum of materials with widely contrasting physicochemical properties. Thus the methods are inherently designed to analytically determine different parts of the continuum, and it is crucial to know how measurements made by different techniques relate to each other. It is clear from this preliminary comparative analysis that a collection of BC reference materials should be established as soon as possible 1) to ensure long-term intralaboratory and interlaboratory data quality and 2) to facilitate comparative analyses between different analytical techniques and scientific approaches.

40|$|The {{ability to}} control the {{transition}} from a two-dimensional (2 D) monolayer to the three-dimensional (3 D) molecular structure in the growth of organic layers on surfaces is essential for the production of functional thin ﬁlms and devices. This has, however, proved to be extremely challenging, starting from the currently limited ability to attain a molecular scale characterization of this transition. Here, through innovative application of low-dose electron diﬀraction and aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (acTEM), combined with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we reveal the structural changes occurring as ﬁlm thickness is increased from monolayer to tens of nanometers for supramolecular assembly of two prototypical <b>benzenecarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> – terephthalic acid (TPA) and trimesic acid (TMA) – on graphene. The intermolecular hydrogen bonding in these molecules is similar and both form well-ordered monolayers on graphene, but their structural transitions with ﬁlm thickness are very diﬀerent. While the structure of TPA thin ﬁlms varies continuously towards the 3 D lattice, TMA retains its planar monolayer structure up to a critical thickness, after which a transition to a polycrystalline ﬁlm occurs. These distinctive structural evolutions can be rationalized in terms of the topological diﬀerences in the 3 D crystallography of the two molecules. The templated 2 D structure of TPA can smoothly map to its 3 D structure through continuous molecular tilting within the unit cell, whilst the 3 D structure of TMA is topologically distinct from its 2 D form, so that only an abrupt transition is possible. The concept of topological protection of the 2 D structure gives a new tool for the molecular design of nanostructured ﬁlms. ...|$|R

The series of ligands contained Molecules with an increasing number of functional groups as well as three structural isomers of the tricarboxylates. Thus, the effects of both the number of carboxylate groups and the relative positions of these groups on the competitive efficiency toward phosphate were probed ill this Study. Quantitative adsorption experiments in batch mode and infrared spectroscopy were collectively Used to evaluate the competitive adsorption reactions. Under the conditions probed, mono- and dicarboxylates had no detectable effect on phosphate adsorption whereas the ligands containing three or more carboxylate groups were able to partially outcompete phosphate. However, the pH dependency and the extent of these competitive effects were strongly dependent on (lie structure and composition of the benzenecarboxylate. The collective results showed that it was the competition for hydrogen-bonding surface sites rather than inner sphere Surface sites that primarily determined the outcome of the competitive adsorption experiments,and it was the ability of the organic ligand to act as hydrogen-bonding acceptor and/or donor {{in various parts of the}} pH range that also determined the competitive pH dependency. The importance of H-bonding for the competitive adsorption between phosphate and <b>benzenecarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> suggested that H-bonding interactions contributed substantially to the stabilities of both the adsorbed benzenecarboxylates and the phosphate ions and that these interactions were structurally specific: i. e., they were sensitive to the locations and the directional properties of the H-acceptor and H-donor surface sites.
