5|$|Varian {{was one of}} a {{very few}} experts in the 21st century who was still {{teaching}} about vaquero equipment, methods, and history. She had a strong interest {{in the history of the}} spade bit horse in California. The spade is an elaborate, complex <b>bit</b> <b>that</b> can only be properly used on a highly trained horse handled by a skilled rider. In the vaquero tradition, its use represents the highest level of trust and communication between horse and rider. The process of training the spade bit horse takes five to seven years to complete. Its emphasis has always been on producing a finely tuned working horse and partner, emphasizing quality rather than on how quickly the goal is reached. The conformation of the horse is also a factor; to become a spade bit horse, the animal must be bred to have a higher neck set and well-carried head. Varian compared the ride and handling of a horse trained in this manner to that of a Jaguar automobile.|$|E

25|$|The {{availability}} of the NX bit on 32-bit x86 kernels, which may run on both 32-bit x86 CPUs and 64-bit IA-32-compatible CPUs, is significant because a 32-bit x86 kernel would not normally expect the NX <b>bit</b> <b>that</b> an AMD64 or IA-64 supplies; the NX enabler patch assures that these kernels will attempt to use the NX bit if present.|$|E
25|$|Like many CPUs of its era {{the cycle}} timing of some {{instructions}} varied {{depending on the}} source operand(s). For example, the unsigned multiply instruction takes (38+2n) clock cycles to complete where 'n' {{is equal to the}} number of bits set in the operand. To create a function that took a fixed cycle count required the addition of extra code after the multiply instruction. This would typically consume extra cycles for each <b>bit</b> <b>that</b> wasn't set in the original multiplication operand.|$|E
25|$|It {{consists}} of a bar that is held {{in place in the}} wearer's mouth by straps or other devices. Unlike the metal <b>bit</b> <b>that</b> is most common in horse bridles, the bar of a bit gag is usually a soft rubber cylinder. It is not very effective in preventing speech, unless combined with mouth stuffing, although it will make it somewhat more difficult for the wearer to produce coherent speech. Occasionally, reins are attached. Because of the possibility of injury to the lips, the bit gag is not suitable for rough play.|$|E

The move followed international arbitration proceedings initiated by foreign investors who sued for discrimination citing preferential trade commitments by India to other countries within existing Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (BIPAs). Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman downplayed the importance of BITs: “We don’t have a BIT with many countries (like the US). That has not impacted investment inflows from that country,”.|$|E
25|$|A {{step drill}} bit is a drill <b>bit</b> <b>that</b> has the tip ground {{down to a}} {{different}} diameter. The transition between this ground diameter and the original diameter is either straight, to form a counterbore, or angled, to form a countersink. The advantage to this style is that both diameters have the same flute characteristics, which keeps the bit from clogging when drilling in softer materials, such as aluminum; in contrast, a drill bit with a slip-on collar {{does not have the}} same benefit. Most of these bits are custom-made for each application, which makes them more expensive.|$|E
25|$|Infinite helical symmetry: If {{there are}} no {{distinguishing}} features {{along the length of}} a helix or helix-like object, the object will have infinite symmetry much like that of a circle, but with the additional requirement of translation along the long axis of the object to return it to its original appearance. A helix-like object is one that has at every point the regular angle of coiling of a helix, but which can also have a cross section of indefinitely high complexity, provided only that precisely the same cross section exists (usually after a rotation) at every point {{along the length of the}} object. Simple examples include evenly coiled springs, slinkies, drill bits, and augers. Stated more precisely, an object has infinite helical symmetries if for any small rotation of the object around its central axis there exists a point nearby (the translation distance) on that axis at which the object will appear exactly as it did before. It is this infinite helical symmetry that gives rise to the curious illusion of movement along the length of an auger or screw <b>bit</b> <b>that</b> is being rotated. It also provides the mechanically useful ability of such devices to move materials along their length, provided that they are combined with a force such as gravity or friction that allows the materials to resist simply rotating along with the drill or auger.|$|E

[...] During this stretch, Jay Weinberg did not appear during any of the shows until reappearing during the Spanish shows {{at the end of}} the leg. [...] While Springsteen's wife Scialfa was nowhere to be seen in Europe, their son Evan appeared and played guitar during encores of a number of shows, while Clarence Clemons' nephew Jake also made playing appearances and Springsteen's mother and aunt also took the stage.|$|E

Earlier that year, he knelt on stage at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recited the Lord's Prayer before a television audience of up to one billion people. In 1993, Bowie said he had an [...] "undying" [...] belief in the [...] "unquestionable" [...] existence of God. Interviewed in 2005, Bowie said whether God exists [...] "is not a question that can be answered.... I'm not quite an atheist and it worries me. There's that little <b>bit</b> <b>that</b> holds on: 'Well, I'm almost an atheist. Give {{me a couple of}} months.... I've nearly got it right.

500|$|Classic Coronation Street was a {{recreation}} of 1960s Coronation Street. It starred Wood as the show's gossiping Ena Sharples, with Julie Walters as Martha Longhurst and Lill Roughley as Minnie Caldwell, with Ena telling them the [...] "gossip" [...] she has {{heard about the}} show's plotlines {{for the next two}} decades. The sketch was written with a detailed knowledge of the soap opera's past: [...] "That stuck up Ida Barlow, who's no better than she should be... it'll not be too long before she falls under a bus! That Harry Hewitt'll likely get crushed under the axle of 'is own van, and as for Valerie Barlow – and if this isn't judgement for setting 'erself up in 'er own front parlour as a so-called 'air stylist then my name isn't Ena Sharples – from what I 'ear, it's two clogs to a threpenny <b>bit</b> <b>that</b> she'll electrocute 'erself with 'er own 'airdryer." [...] This sketch's accuracy earned Wood praise from Doris Speed, who had played Annie Walker in Coronation Street from 1960 to 1983.|$|E
500|$|There was {{a variety}} of {{headgear}} used to control horses, predominantly bridles with assorted designs of bits. [...] Many of the bits used during the Middle Ages resemble the bradoon, snaffle bit and curb <b>bit</b> <b>that</b> are still in common use today. [...] However, they often were decorated to a greater degree: [...] the bit rings or shanks were frequently covered with large, ornamental [...] "bosses." [...] Some designs were also more extreme and severe than those used today.The curb bit was known during the classical period, but was not generally used during the Middle Ages until the mid-14th century. [...] Some styles of snaffle bit used during the Middle Ages had the lower cheek extended, {{in the manner of}} the modern half-cheek or full cheek snaffle. Until the late 13th century, bridles generally had a single pair of reins; after this period it became more common for knights to use two sets of reins, {{similar to that of the}} modern double bridle, and often at least one set was decorated.|$|E
500|$|The tour {{differed}} from his television shows {{in that there}} was no desk or celebrity interviews, but presented as more of a variety show than a stand-up routine. Many elements from TV were incorporated into the show, including video bits, musical and comic performers, and cameo appearances by celebrities. Classic sketches were also revived for the tour, albeit under different names due to legal issues over the ownership rights. The Masturbating Bear, for example, made a brief appearance before being transformed into the Self-Pleasuring Panda. Also, the [...] "Walker, Texas Ranger lever" [...] was retitled the [...] "Chuck Norris Rural Policeman Handle". Triumph the Insult Comic Dog mocked the city the tour was appearing in as himself in a prerecorded <b>bit</b> <b>that</b> inserts information about the city by dubbing over the original audio. O'Brien also introduced a giant inflatable bat he claimed to have purchased during Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell tour and at one point walked onstage wearing a replica of Eddie Murphy's purple suit from his comedy special Eddie Murphy Raw. In addition, O'Brien performed music throughout the show, including the disco hit [...] "I Will Survive" [...] and a personal parody of [...] "On the Road Again".|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were {{completely}} negative. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club wrote positively {{of the first}} part of the episode's humor and awarded it a B+. Handlen noted that [...] "the context of seeing actors in the wrong places" [...] is [...] "what’s funny about the episode". However, he did slightly criticize the episode's padding—specifically Nora Dunn's role as Fletcher's wife and the Duck Soup mirror gag—but argued that [...] "for every <b>bit</b> <b>that</b> doesn’t play in the episode, there are three that do." [...] Todd VanDerWerff, also from The A.V. Club, gave the second half of the episode a B– and wrote, [...] "I have basically nothing to add to what Zack said about the first 'Dreamland' last week. 'Dreamland II' is a fairly unnecessary hour of television, and there’s no reason this logy two-parter couldn’t have become a much tighter one-hour episode." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote that [...] "my final judgement on 'Dreamland' [...] is that I enjoyed the entertainment value it presented. It was fun and I'm not one to begrudge a little romp now and then." [...] Kessenich, however, did note that the second part [...] "felt strung out". Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson, however, saw the episode in a more positive light and said, [...] "Season six included some more excellent episodes only peripherally related to the main story arc, [...] Dreamland parts one and two". Kerry Fall from DVD Journal wrote positively of the episodes and described them, together as [...] "one of the best episodes in years". Gareth Wigmore of TV Zone gave {{the first part of}} the episode an 8 out of 10 rating and highlighted the [...] "strong story-telling, clever dialogue, and good acting". Earl Cressey from DVD Talk concluded that both [...] "Dreamland" [...] parts one and two were among the [...] "highlights of season six". Topless Robot named [...] "Dreamland" [...] the fourth funniest episode of the series.|$|E
500|$|The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien premiered on June 1, 2009, with The Max Weinberg 7 now {{expanded}} to eight {{and referred to}} as Max Weinberg and the Tonight Show Band. [...] Andy Richter was back as an announcer, making Weinberg's role as a foil a little uncertain. [...] Gradually Weinberg and the band's roles in the comic aspects of the show began to assert themselves. On June 25, Weinberg departed The Tonight Show temporarily for four weeks to join Springsteen and band part-way through their European leg; this was conveyed on the show via a comedy <b>bit</b> <b>that</b> had his drum riser turn into a float that took him outside the studio and purportedly to the airport. [...] Weinberg returned to the show on August 3, after flying back from a Springsteen show that had ended early into the same morning in Spain. [...] Of being Tonight Show bandleader, he said, [...] "I {{think one of the}} biggest thrills in my life was seeing my name in the same sentence as Doc Severinsen, who, in my view, is the gold standard for 'Tonight Show' bandleaders. There's never been anyone who did it quite near the class and the brilliance of Doc Severinsen in the original Tonight Show Band. I used to think when I was a kid what a great job that must be – you know, same place, every time, everyday. Lo and behold, here I am 40 years later, doing it. That sounds deep, deep, deep, deep, deeply satisfying to me." [...] On September 25, Weinberg left The Tonight Show again for two months, to join Springsteen and band for the final, American portion of the Working on a Dream Tour. [...] The same drum-riser-to-float comedy bit was used, except this time the float was [...] "hit" [...] and demolished by a truck just outside the studio (and airing of the segment was delayed a few days due to O'Brien legitimately injuring himself during the same show). [...] The tour wrapped on November 22, 2009, in Buffalo, New York; Weinberg was back on The Tonight Show the next day. [...] With no E Street Band projects in sight {{for at least the next}} year or two, Weinberg was left to concentrate on his bandleader role.|$|E
