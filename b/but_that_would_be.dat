5|$|Looking for a 3-peat, the Heat {{dominated}} the 2014 postseason, going 12–3 {{in the first}} three rounds. They reached the 2014 NBA Finals and faced the Spurs in a rematch of the 2013 Finals. With James limited in Game 1 due to leg cramps, the Spurs ended the game on a 31–9 run, winning the game 110–95. The Heat would win Game 2, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> their only win of the series, as the Spurs would win Games 3, 4, and 5 to win the Championship, their first since 2007 and the fifth and final title of Duncan's career. Kawhi Leonard was named Finals MVP, becoming the third-youngest Finals MVP after Duncan and Magic Johnson.|$|E
25|$|Next {{was another}} ranked team, as 16th ranked Auburn came to Gainesville. The first half {{may have been}} closer than most would have expected, as Auburn kicked a field goal late to trail just 21–10. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> it for the Tigers as the Gators reeled off 30 {{unanswered}} points {{en route to a}} 51–10 win.|$|E
25|$|The Patriots {{reduced the}} lead to 14-6 on Smith's 42-yard field goal early in the third quarter. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{as close to a}} lead as the Patriots would get. The Dolphins scored again with {{touchdown}}s from Woody Bennett, another 2-yard catch by Hardy late in the third quarter, {{and in the middle of}} the fourth. With 5:32 left in the game, Grogan threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to tight end Don Hasselbeck that made the final score 28-13.|$|E

25|$|Joe Dailey {{would start}} off the scoring {{in the second}} half with a 13-yd pass to Hakeem Nicks but the Irish defense would block another XP attempt making the score 31-19. The Irish would strike back with Quinn hitting Jeff Samardzija with a 42-yd pass to make the score 38-19. UNC would repeat their earlier tandem with Dailey {{throwing}} a 72-yd pass to Nicks to cut the deficit to 38-26. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> UNC's last hurrah in this game as the Irish defense would prevent anymore scoring and the lone score of the 4th quarter was Darius Walker's 1-yd run to give 45-26 final.|$|E
25|$|When Bakunin visited Japan {{after his}} escape from Siberia, {{he was not}} really {{involved}} in its politics or with the Japanese peasants. This might be taken as evidence of a basic disinterest in Asia, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> incorrect. Bakunin stopped over briefly in Japan {{as part of a}} hurried flight from twelve years of imprisonment, a marked man racing across the world to his European home; he had neither Japanese contacts nor any facility in the Japanese language; the small number of expatriate newspapers by Europeans published in China and Japan provided no insights into local revolutionary conditions or possibilities. Besides, Bakunin's conversion to anarchism came in 1865, towards the end of his life, and four years after his time in Japan.|$|E
25|$|City {{started the}} 2016–17 season with mixed form, winning two and losing {{two of their}} opening four games. This was {{followed}} by a run of victories that resulted in the Imps sitting top of the table after a victory at Tranmere, the first time the club had topped any table in ten years. The form again dipped with defeats to Dover and Barrow in late September, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the last time that the Imps would taste defeat in any competition until a last minute defeat to Guiseley on Boxing Day. During that run the Imps travelled to run-away leaders Forest Green and would have fallen twelve points behind with a defeat, but three goals in the final 30 minutes turned around a 2–0 deficit.|$|E

25|$|Hoping {{to rebound}} from their road {{loss to the}} Giants, the Buccaneers went home for an NFC South rematch with the New Orleans Saints. In the first quarter, the Bucs trailed early as Saints QB Drew Brees {{completed}} a 15-yard TD pass to WR Marques Colston and a 52-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson. In the second quarter, kicker John Carney helped New Orleans improve its lead with a 46-yard field goal. Tampa Bay would valiantly fight back, as QB Bruce Gradkowski completed a 44-yard TD pass and a 17-yard TD pass to WR Joey Galloway, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> as close as they would get. In the third quarter, Saints pulled away with RB Deuce McAllister completing a 3-yard TD run and Bree completing a 45-yard TD pass to Henderson. With a scoreless second half, the Bucs would fall to 2–6.|$|E
25|$|Wood {{started the}} 1981 {{season with a}} loss to Abilene Cooper, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the only loss the Lions would see that season. Brownwood {{went on to win}} {{thirteen}} victories to claim another district title and their seventh state championship. The Lions opened up the next season with their first win over Abilene Cooper since 1977. That game was also historical because it was Wood's 366th win, which tied Red Franklin's record set back in 1958. When Brownwood won their next game over Weatherford, Coach Wood became the winningest high school football coach in the United States with 367 wins. Although his team lost to San Angelo Central and another loss to Cleburne (9-3 at TCU's Amon G. Carter Stadium, est attendance of 38,000 fans) cost the Lions their district crown the UIL passed a new rule in 1982, which allowed two teams from each district to advance to the state playoffs. Brownwood took the second place spot, but lost their first game in the playoffs to Gainesville, 14 to 12. Wood's team put away their cleats with nine wins and three losses.|$|E
500|$|The Kieninger Trap {{is named}} after Georg Kieninger who used it in an offhand game against Godai at Vienna in 1925.

The Bb4 is attacked but Black {{does not have to}} move it for the moment, and instead both regains the gambit pawn and sets a trap with 7...Ngxe5 (see diagram at right). Superficially, White seems to win a piece with 8.axb4??, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> falling into the Kieninger Trap because it would allow 8...Nd3 mate; even after the exchange 8.Nxe5 Nxe5, the threat of ...Nd3 mate remains and indirectly defends the Bb4 from capture.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were as positive, however. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "C+" [...] and highly criticized the {{characterization}} of Michael. Largely, he felt that Michael's antics made him {{out to be a}} jerk because the series has not worked at showing that he truly [...] "isn’t a complete asshole". Adams noted that Michael [...] "could truly force Darryl and his staff to work on Saturdays, and he truly could fire them for winning the basketball game. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> an outrageous abuse of legitimate power, which isn’t funny." [...] Ultimately he argued that the basketball scenes went on for too long; he said the [...] "episode’s original cut ran too long to air, and it’s obvious where the basketball scenes boxed out other threads of the episode".|$|E
500|$|The {{idea behind}} using the sex gas came from Chibnall, but he {{admitted}} to having [...] "genuinely no idea where the episode came from". Davies stated [...] "when we're launching a new adult science fiction drama, it's kind of inevitable you're {{going to do the}} sex monster." [...] He also emphasised that the episode is not solely about [...] "having a laugh" [...] with the sex gas, as it also has [...] "something to say about the world". The scene where Carys walks down the street featuring sex in advertisements and couples kissing in public was one of Davies' favourite scenes in the episode, as it explores how [...] the Western world is. The episode was originally much lighter in tone, however, the majority of the comedic moments had to be cut on the final script, as they {{got in the way of}} the plot. Also, Carys was originally meant to have two or three boyfriends, but because of scheduling restrictions, there could only be one. This ended up being beneficial to the episode, as it made it more emotive. There was a scene that would be filmed with Carys and a second boyfriend, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> cut and added on the deleted scenes on the DVD boxset of the first series.|$|E
500|$|During the war, an {{incident}} occurred involving the Prince George's County jail, when local resident Dr. William Beanes, (1775–1824) captured several marauding British Army deserters from the passing army of General General Robert Ross (1766–1814) and Vice Admiral, Sir George Cockburn, (1772–1853), {{and held them}} in the County Jail, after he had treated several wounded [...] "Redcoat" [...] soldiers in their march on to Washington and the disastrous Battle of Bladensburg on the Eastern Branch stream of the Anacostia River in August 1814. Later he was arrested along with several others including Robert Bowie, former 11th Governor of Maryland (1803–06, 1811–12) by retreating British cavalry on orders from Ross who had stayed in his home as headquarters. Later Francis Scott Key (1779–1843), a Georgetown and Frederick lawyer with Col. John S. Skinner, U.S. Prisoner-of-War and Parole Agent went to Baltimore secured a small sailing ship, the Minden, and sailed down the Patapsco River and the Chesapeake Bay to find the British Royal Navy fleet after leaving the Patuxent River, beating up the Bay from their base on Tangier Island, Virginia heading for their attack on the hated [...] "nest of pirates" [...] - Baltimore. After being received and negotiating with General Ross, Admiral Cockburn and their superior, Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, (1758–1832), and showing him some letters written by captured British wounded soldiers testifying to [...] the fair treatment Beanes had given them and tended to them, they agreed to free him <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> held up until they could celebrate after the Burning of Baltimore following their attack on Fort McHenry and landing troops to the east at North Point. Well, the famous story has been told, how the general was killed prior to the skirmishing at the Battle of North Point on September 12, how the advancing British under successor, Colonel Arthur Brooke led the British regiments to face the 20,000 drafted and volunteer citizens and militia {{under the command of}} Major General Samuel Smith, (1752–1839), of the Maryland Militia on the eastern heights of [...] "Loudenschlager's Hill" [...] (later known as [...] "Hampstead Hill" [...] in modern Patterson Park, between Highlandtown and Canton neighborhoods) whose dug-in fortifications and dragged cannon were so numerous that the [...] "Redcoats" [...] halted in their tracks and decided to await the shelling of the fort which guarded the entrances to the Harbor to pass into the inner port and the waterfront of Fells Point. Following the failure of the fort to fall to two days of [...] "the rockets' red glare and the bombs bursting in air" [...] and their flanking troop-loaded barge attack around the west end but driven back by alert artillery seamen at Forts Covington and Babcock in a driving night rainstorm, the British fleet turned about and set sail. Key and his companions Beanes and Skinner who were startled, amazed and emotionally overcome [...] to see a huge 30 by 42 foot banner being raised {{in the light of the}} early morning with the distant booming of the morning's gun salute, knew that the fort and the city had held. When they landed at [...] "The Basin" [...] (modern [...] "Inner Harbor") and Key finished up his draft of a new poem [...] "The Defence of Fort McHenry" [...] at the Indian Queen Hotel at West Baltimore and Hanover Streets, (later to be set to music in a few days) and sung lustily through the city, performed on the stage at the famed Holliday Street Theatre, and then soon throughout the state and soon the nation as [...] "The Star Spangled Banner".|$|E
