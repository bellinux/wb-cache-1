According to Heather Phares of Allmusic, the song [...] "has a silky verse melody that just barely conceals [...] spite", while she keeps [...] "her revenge sweet, the extra sting being given to it {{by the way she}} sounds like she's singing about how ice cream or puppies or being in love makes her smile". Blender reporter Jon Dolan claims that Allen [...] "deploys a sugary melody as a Trojan horse for a smackdown on a douche-bag ex-boyfriend", as Rob Webb from Drowned in Sound called [...] "Smile" [...] an [...] "infectious slice of bouncing, carnival reggae that punches hard with its opening line: 'When you first left me / I was wanting more / <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> fucking that girl next door / What you do that for?,'" [...] and {{went on to say that}} the theme of the song is melancholy, [...] "set against breezy beats", and while not being [...] "an obvious TOTP contender on the surface, [...] is good but far from one of the LP's choice cuts". Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone gave a rather negative review, claiming the singer [...] "doesn't sound as if she's trying too hard", singing the song with a [...] "breezy sha-la-la lilt that just made the song seem even nastier". Later, he called Allen a [...] "theoretical pop princess, who just entered the breakup-song hall of fame". Dom Passantino of Stylus suggested that [...] "'Smile' gets burned off the lights by both Sean Paul and Abs when it comes to facsimiles of 'Uptown Top Ranking,' but neither of them could bring the quality of lyricism the singer does," [...] while Slant Magazine reporter Sal Cinquemani was baffled as to why the song, which she [...] "sings without a smirk of irony", is a UK chart-topper.|$|E
500|$|The {{computers}} seen in {{the internet}} cafe that the Simpsons visit {{in the beginning of}} the episode are based on the Apple iMac computers. In a scene inside Flanders' kitchen, a note which reads [...] "1 COR 6:9-11" [...] can be seen. This refers to the Bible, First Corinthian, chapter 6, verses 9 to 11: [...] "Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God." [...] The cups in the 33 cent store read That '70s Show, a reference which Danny Masterson, one of the lead actors in That '70s Show, was entertained by, according to Scully. Battling Seizure Robots, the seizure-inducing television show that the Simpsons watch in their hotel room, is based on an episode of Pokémon, called [...] "Dennō Senshi Porygon", which caused 685 children to develop epileptic seizures. According to Scully, the staff received [...] "several angry letters" [...] from people for the scene. After the cartoon, an advertisement for Mr. Sparkle, a character that first appeared in the season 8 episode [...] "In Marge We Trust", can be seen on the television screen. Barney, while impersonating Homer, says [...] "That boy ain't right", a line frequently used by Hank Hill, the main character of the animated television series King of the Hill. The giant monsters attacking at the end of the episode are Godzilla, Gamera, Rodan and Mothra, all of which are famous from Japanese monster movies. The scene was included as a reference to the 1998 action science fiction film Godzilla, in which three of the main The Simpsons cast members (Azaria, Cartwright and Shearer) had a live-action role.|$|E

2500|$|Puyi came to Beijing on 9 December 1959 {{with special}} {{permission}} from Mao Zedong and lived {{for the next}} six months in an ordinary Beijing residence with his sister before being transferred to a government-sponsored hotel. Puyi had the job of sweeping the streets, and got lost on his first day of work, which led him to tell astonished passers-by: [...] "I'm Puyi, the last Emperor of the Qing dynasty. I'm staying with relatives and can't find my way home". One of Puyi's first acts upon returning to Beijing was to visit the Forbidden City as a tourist, where he pointed out to other tourists that many of the exhibits were the things he had used in his youth. He voiced his support for the Communists and worked at the Beijing Botanical Gardens. Working as a simple gardener gave Puyi a degree of happiness that he had never known as an emperor, though he was notably clumsy. Behr noted that in Europe people who played roles analogous to the role Puyi played in Manchukuo were generally executed; for example, the British hanged William Joyce ("Lord Haw-haw") only for being the announcer on the English-language broadcasts of Radio Berlin, Italian Communist guerrillas shot Benito Mussolini, and the French executed Pierre Laval, so many Westerners are surprised that Puyi was released from prison after only nine years to start a new life. Behr wrote that the Communist ideology explained this difference, writing: [...] "In a society where all landlord and 'capitalist-roaders' were evil incarnate, it did not matter so much that Puyi was also a traitor to his country: he was, in the eyes of the Communist ideologues, only behaving true to type. If all capitalists and landlords were, by their very nature, traitors, it was only logical that Puyi, the biggest landlord, should also be the biggest traitor. And, in the last resort, Puyi was far more valuable alive than dead". In early 1960, Puyi met Premier Zhou Enlai, who told him: [...] "You weren't responsible for becoming Emperor at the age of three or the 1917 attempted restoration coup. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> fully to blame for what happened later. You knew perfectly well what you were doing when you took refuge in the Legation Quarter, when you traveled under Japanese protection to Tianjin, and when you agreed to become Manchukuo Chief Executive." [...] Puyi responded by merely saying that though he did not choose to be an emperor, he had behaved with savage cruelty as boy-emperor and wished he could apologize to all of the eunuchs he had flogged during his youth.|$|E
