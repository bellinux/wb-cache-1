Following the third practice session, Harvick stated, [...] "We didn't put up a fast lap but it never slows down. I'm really excited." [...] Afterward, Johnson commented [...] "We struggled a little bit maybe in the first practice. But I found a good direction and started making some good gains there at the end. I feel really good about our car. It's very comfortable. I can run the top, run the bottom. I think we're in good shape." [...] "I think we've got the balance real close," [...] Johnson continued. [...] "My motor's running great. Maybe some overall grip <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> I'm one of 43 guys that are saying that. This hot sun out here [...] the track awful slick." ...|$|E
2500|$|Winter and his wife, Monique, live in Beverly Hills. The {{couple have}} no {{children}} and Winter stated in an interview: [...] "I {{can see how}} {{that would be a}} wonderful rewarding thing, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are enough people in the world" [...] and that [...] "It might have been more problematical if I had children with a career and all of it. I tour all the time. If I were to have children, I would want to be home all the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first time}} she was asked about her mother's {{handling}} of the Lewinsky scandal at a campaign stop Clinton responded, [...] "I {{do not think that}} is any of your business." [...] As she became a more experienced campaigner, she refined her responses and deflected questions on the issue with comments such as, [...] "If that's what you want to vote on, that's what you should vote on. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are other people [...] going to vote on things like healthcare and economics." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Keith {{regarded}} him affectionately. [...] "It's yours, Dick; given without reserve. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> {{nothing more to}} be said, and no doubt you're anxious to get away. Besides, the Colonel will be expecting you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Not for you, no; {{only for}} me. There’s nothing {{that a man}} can do that’s wrong, is there? En morale, you know, I mean. Ah, yes, he can kill and steal; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there’s</b> nothing else, is there?” ...|$|R
2500|$|In a July 2012 {{edition of}} Sports Illustrated, Jackson talked about several issues, and also was {{critical}} of the Baseball Writers' Association of America as he believes they have lowered their standards when voting for prospects in the Hall of Fame. He has also been critical of players associated with performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), including distant cousin Barry Bonds, stating [...] "I believe that Hank Aaron is the home run king, not Barry Bonds, as great of a player Bonds was." [...] Of Alex Rodriguez, whom Jackson has worked alongside as {{special assistant to the}} Yankees, Jackson remarked, [...] "Al's a very good friend. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are real questions about his numbers. As much as I like him, what he admitted about his usage does cloud some of his numbers." [...] On July 12, the Yankees released a statement from Jackson after the Sports Illustrated interview had been released. The press release included Jackson saying, [...] "In trying to convey my feelings about a few issues that I am passionate about, I made the mistake of naming some specific players." [...] It had been reported [...] he had been told by the Yankees to steer clear from the team, although general manager Brian Cashman stated he had not been banned but only told to not join the club on a road trip to Boston and would later be free to interact with the club. After the SI article became known and Jackson's status with the Yankees being talked about, Jackson confirmed in his statement [...] "I continue to have a strong relationship with the club, and look forward to continuing my role with the team." ...|$|E

5000|$|On September 21, 2008, Collider {{published}} {{an exclusive interview}} with John Davis (the producer of both AVP films) and he stated, [...] "I think we’ve logically done what we could’ve done with the two AVP movies. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there’s</b> something to go back to with Predator." ...|$|R
60|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. When my {{council in}} Jinghiskahn {{reached the point}} of coming to blows, I used to adjourn the sitting. Let us {{postpone}} the discussion. Wait until Monday: we shall have Sunday to quiet down in. Believe me, I'm not making fun of you; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> something in this young gentleman's advice.

6000|$|... 'It'll do,' {{the manager}} answered, more confidently; 'I won't predict a success, {{because you know}} a manager should never prophesy unless he knows; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> a Public in London that'll take it in, just as they took in [...] "Caste" [...] and [...] "Society," [...] twenty years back, at the Prince of Wales's.

6000|$|... "I didn't take {{particular}} notice," [...] he said, dubiously, [...] "not {{knowing the}} ways of the place. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was a person, too, come in alonger me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Cora;--it {{certainly}} does not fret me, or I should not allow it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> should be a limit. No man is ever rich enough to squander." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{stood up}} before the waning fire and smiled at us all. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> {{was just a little}} {{hesitation}} in his smile. [...] "If I begin--" [...] he said.|$|E
5000|$|Andy Hallett, {{who played}} Lorne, called the Groosalugg [...] "Fabio and Keanu Reeves' love child." [...] Mark Lutz says, [...] "He's {{got such a}} {{dichotomy}} to him where he's all brave and noble on one hand, and so naive and brainwashed on the other. I {{know a lot of}} the fans say, 'Oh, he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer,' <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> more to him than that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You sneer so easily. I'm sorry, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> {{something}} essentially cheap in your attitude. Especially about religion.|$|R

6000|$|... "Excuse me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> {{must be some}} mistake! We {{brought up}} your luggage with you--two trunks--in the station wagon. A man has just arrived with three more, which he says are yours." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Allen may be {{a better}} judge of the present state of things, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was always a studious set who were respectable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{a little}} risk certainly, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is a great one. Anyhow, the attempt must be made," [...] said Alan quietly.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] sighed Geraldine; [...] "he has not {{the fine}} {{athletic}} {{strength of his}} dear father, <b>but</b> still—-still <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is that in him which Edgar had not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Six, I think; yes--one, two, three,--I can't {{make them}} out quite, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are six, besides {{the one on}} the ice. Hist! there he sees him. Ah! Meetuck, he's too quick for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{the captain}} said, [...] "let us {{get up the}} sails. There is but little wind, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is enough to give us {{steerage}} way and prevent us from drifting on to the sandbanks." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cohen told Newsday in August 2009 {{that the}} {{reported}} 26-episode order means [...] "t {{will be up}} to 26. I can't guarantee it will be 26. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> a pretty good chance it'll be exactly 26. Fox has been a little bit cagey about it, even internally.

6000|$|... "I am no coward, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is {{much more}} to be feared, Peter. The arm of the Pope is long, and the arm of the crafty Ferdinand is longer, and both of them grope for the throats and moneybags of heretics." ...|$|E
60|$|There is an air {{of realism}} and disillusionment about this position, which makes it {{attractive}} to those idealists who wish to think themselves cynics. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are various points in which it fails to be as realistic as it pretends.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{they would}} have done better, a year or two since, when we were {{settling}} a new tariff; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>there</b> would be less demand for them now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Saloonio, Colonel?" [...] I {{interposed}} mildly, [...] "aren't {{you making}} a mistake? There's a Bassanio and a Salanio in the play, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> any Saloonio, is there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Hoopdriver {{watched the}} door shut. He had {{intended}} to step out {{into the middle of}} the room, fold his arms and say, [...] "You are in trouble. I am a Friend. Trust me."
