5|$|The Apollo 14 {{crew members}} sampled <b>boulders</b> in the ejecta of Cone crater. These <b>boulders</b> {{appeared}} to be layered and fractured breccias, contrasting from {{the appearance of the}} surrounding area because of their older age. As these <b>boulders</b> increase in size and number closer to Cone crater, it is believed that they originate from the greatest depth of excavation of Cone crater. These <b>boulders</b> show what is believed to be general characteristics of the Fra Mauro formation: clastic texture, stratification, and jointing or fracturing.|$|E

5|$|Marko was {{associated}} with large, solitary <b>boulders</b> and indentations in rocks; the <b>boulders</b> {{were said to be}} thrown by him from a hill, and the indentations were his footprints (or the hoofprints of his horse). He was also connected with geographic features such as hills, glens, cliffs, caves, rivers, brooks and groves, which he created or at which he did something memorable. They were often named after him, and there are many toponyms—from Istria in the west to Bulgaria in the east—derived from his name. In Bulgarian and Macedonian stories, Marko had an equally strong sister who competed with him in throwing <b>boulders.</b>|$|E

5|$|All {{seventeen}} of the confirmed {{heads in}} the Olmec heartland were sculpted from basalt mined in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. Most were formed from coarse grained dark grey basalt known as Cerro Cintepec basalt after a volcano in the range. Investigators have proposed that large Cerro Cintepec basalt <b>boulders</b> found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains {{are the source of}} the stone for the monuments. These <b>boulders</b> are found in an area affected by large lahars (volcanic mudslides) that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes, which suggests that the Olmecs did not need to quarry the raw material for sculpting the heads. Roughly spherical <b>boulders</b> were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head. The stone for the San Lorenzo and La Venta heads was transported a considerable distance from the source. The La Cobata head was found on El Vigia hill in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas and the stone from Tres Zapotes Colossal Head1 and Nestepe Colossal Head1 (also known as Tres Zapotes MonumentsA andQ) came from the same hill.|$|E

5|$|Bouldering {{is a form}} of rock {{climbing}} that is performed on large <b>boulders,</b> small rock formations or artificial rock walls, without the use of ropes or harnesses. While it can be done without any equipment whatsoever, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the path that a climber takes in order to complete the climb) are usually less than 6 meters (20ft.) tall. Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without natural <b>boulders.</b> Bouldering competitions, which employ a variety of formats, take place in both indoor and outdoor settings.|$|E
