5|$|The Pensacola Dam, {{also known}} as the Grand River Dam, is a multiple-arch <b>buttress</b> <b>dam</b> on the Grand River {{in-between}} Disney and Langley in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The dam is operated by the Grand River Dam Authority and creates Grand Lake o' the Cherokees. After decades of vision and planning, it was constructed between 1938 and 1940 for the purposes of hydroelectric power generation, flood control and recreation. It is Oklahoma's first hydroelectric power plant and {{is referred to as the}} longest multiple-arch dam in the world.|$|E
5|$|After nearly 30 {{years of}} {{struggling}} with funding and pursuing various deals, William Beardsley hired engineer Carl Pleasant {{to assist with}} designing. Pleasant recommended hiring the engineer firm Peckham and James to draft plans for the storage dam at the Frogs Tank site. The gravity dam design was dropped, and a relatively new, cheaper and improved but controversial design was adopted: the multiple-arch <b>buttress</b> <b>dam.</b> In 1925, under a new state law, Beardsley was able to create the Beardsley-Agua Fria Water Conservation District. Under the new district, funds could be raised through a bond issue. On December 20, 1925, the construction contract was signed, but the bonds {{had yet to be}} purchased. Five days before the contract was signed, Beardsley died. His son, Robert took direction of the project along with Pleasant. In early 1926, Pleasant eventually sold the needed bonds to the New York firm Brandon, Gordon and Waddell. The firm sent Donald Ware Waddell to oversee construction.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{multiple}} arch <b>buttress</b> <b>dam</b> was the Esparragalejo Dam in Spain, whose 320m long {{wall was}} supported on its air face alternatingly by buttresses and concave-shaped arches.

50|$|<b>Buttress</b> style {{diversion}} <b>dams</b> {{are designed}} using angle supports on the downstream {{side of the}} dam. The supports are fixed {{to the wall of}} the dam in order to help counteract the force of the water on the <b>dam.</b> <b>Buttress</b> style <b>dams</b> are built across wide valleys that do not have a solid bedrock foundation. Bedrock is solid rock that makes up {{the upper part of the}} earth’s crust. Bedrock can be made from sedimentary, igneous, and metaphoric rock origins. <b>Buttress</b> <b>dams</b> require extensive steel framework and labor. As a result, <b>buttress</b> style <b>dams</b> are expensive to construct and are seldom built today.|$|R
25|$|Roman {{engineers}} made routine use {{of ancient}} standard designs like embankment dams and masonry gravity dams. Apart from that, they displayed {{a high degree}} of inventiveness, introducing most of the other basic dam designs which had been unknown until then. These include arch-gravity <b>dams,</b> arch <b>dams,</b> <b>buttress</b> <b>dams</b> and multiple arch <b>buttress</b> <b>dams,</b> all of which were known and employed by the 2nd century AD (see List of Roman dams). Roman workforces also were the first to build dam bridges, such as the Bridge of Valerian in Iran.|$|R
25|$|The longest <b>buttress</b> <b>dam</b> was the 632+m long Consuegra Dam (3rd–4thcenturyAD) {{in central}} Spain {{which is still}} fairly well preserved. Instead of an earth embankment, its only 1.3m thick {{retaining}} wall was supported on the downstream side by buttresses in regular intervals of 5 to 10m. In Spain, {{a large number of}} ancient buttress dams are concentrated, representing nearly one-third of the total found there.|$|E
25|$|The era {{of large}} dams was {{initiated}} {{with the construction}} of the Aswan Low Dam in Egypt in 1902, a gravity masonry <b>buttress</b> <b>dam</b> on the Nile River. Following their 1882 invasion and occupation of Egypt, the British began construction in 1898. The project was designed by Sir William Willcocks and involved several eminent engineers of the time, including Sir Benjamin Baker and Sir John Aird, whose firm, John Aird & Co., was the main contractor. Capital and financing were furnished by Ernest Cassel. When initially constructed between 1899 and 1902, nothing of its scale had ever been attempted; on completion, it was the largest masonry dam in the world.|$|E

40|$|The shear {{strength}} of a bonded concrete-rock interface below a concrete dam consists of two parts: friction from the self-weight of the dam and cohesion due to the glue in the cement paste binding the surfaces together. For flat-slab <b>buttress</b> <b>dams</b> with low self-weight, the cohesive strength becomes extra significant for the sliding resistance. However, the Norwegian authorities on dam safety does not allow the use of cohesion in sliding stability calculations, unless the cohesive strength can be documented through tests. Yet, no proposal is given on how such tests should be carried out. Consequently, the main scope of this thesis have been to develop and propose a test methodology to estimate the cohesive strength of Norwegian flat-slab <b>buttress</b> <b>dams.</b> The proposed testing procedure uses rock samples from the dam site to get the occurring roughness and strength of the bedrock. Furthermore, the test-specimen are prepared and concrete replicating the concrete of the dam are then cast on the natural surfaces of the rock samples. A series of shear tests is then carried out to measure the {{shear strength}} of the concrete-rock interfaces. Finally, {{the value of the}} cohesion is extrapolated out of the τ-σ curve. Preliminary testing of the methodology revealed the importance of thorough preparation of the test-specimen beforehand, but in the end left the author optimistic regarding the test methodology s future use. Additionally, to investigate the effect of including cohesion in sliding stability calculations, the sliding safety of one of Statkrafts flat-slab <b>buttress</b> <b>dams,</b> Kalhovd dam, was assessed with a combination of FE-analysis and simplified hand calculations. The results showed that by assuming reasonable values for the cohesion, the dam managed to meet the requirements from the Norwegian dam authorities. One problem when applying cohesion in calculations, however, is to determine the compressive zone of the dam. Assuming a linearly distributed normal stress seemed to overestimate the compressive area compared to the results from the finite element analysis, indicating that the latter might be the best tool for this purpose...|$|R
50|$|Norfork Dam is a gravity dam; {{this means}} that it resists the thrust of water entirely by its own weight. This take {{enormous}} amounts of concrete which can be expensive; however, many engineers prefer the solid strength of gravity dams to arch <b>dams</b> or <b>buttress</b> <b>dams.</b> For example, Norfork Dam and the powerhouse cost approximately 28,600,000 dollars; a very large sum {{of money in the}} early 1940s.

Dams are mainly divided into four parts {{on the basis of}} the type and materials of construction as gravity <b>dams,</b> <b>buttress</b> <b>dams,</b> arch dams, and embankment dams. There are two types of embankment dams: earthfill dams and rockfill dams. In this study, seepage through an earthfill dam's body is investigated using an artificial neural network model. Seepage is investigated since seepage both in the dam's body and under the foundation adversely affects dam's stability. This study specifically investigated seepage in dam. s body. The seepage in the dams body follows a phreatic line. In order to understand the degree of seepage, it is necessary to measure the level of phreatic line. This measurement is called as piezometric measurement. Piezometric data sets which are collected from Jeziorsko earthfill dam in Poland were used for training and testing the developed ANN model. Jeziorsko dam is a non-homogeneous earthfill dam built on the impervious foundation. Artificial Neural Networks are one of the artificial intelligence related technologies and have many properties. In this study the water levels on the upstream and downstream sides of the dam were input variables and the water levels in the piezometers were the target outputs in the artificial neural network model. In the line of the purpose of this research, the locus of the seepage path in an earthfill dam is estimated by artificial neural networks. MATLAB 6 neural network toolbox is used for this study.

40|$|Dam designs may {{be divided}} into three main types : gravity {{structures}} relying on their weight for stability, arch structures using the abutment reaction forces and <b>buttress</b> <b>dams.</b> The design of an arch dam relies on the abutment reaction forces to resist the water pressure force and it requires advanced engineering expertise. The present study demonstrates that {{the historical development of}} arch dams took place in five stages. The world 2 ̆ 7 s oldest arch dams were built by the Romans in France and Spain. They were followed by the Mongols who built dams in Iran during the 13 th and 14 th centuries. However it is not until the 19 th century that significant progress in arch dam design was made. Four remarkable structures were the Meer Allum dam (India 1804), the Jones Falls dam (Canada 1831), the Zola dam (France 1854) and Parramatta dam (Australia 1856).
