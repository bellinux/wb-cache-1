5|$|His parents' {{marriage}} {{dissolved in}} July 1888, when Max Döblin eloped with Henriette Zander, a seamstress twenty years his junior, {{and moved to}} America {{to start a new}} life. The catastrophic loss of his father was a central event in Döblin's childhood and would be formative for his later life. Shortly thereafter, in October 1888, Sophie and the five children moved to Berlin and took up residence in a small shabby apartment on the Blumenstraße in Berlin's working-class east. Döblin's parents briefly reconciled in 1889, when Max returned penniless from America; the family moved to Hamburg in April 1889, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to light that Max had brought his lover back with him and was leading a double life, Sophie and the children returned to Berlin in September 1889.|$|E

Although he had paintings and prints in several exhibitions, and was {{actively involved in}} Seattle's arts community, he didn't immediately focus on a career in art, as he was helping his uncles with the family business.|$|E
25|$|Meir {{stated in}} the 1975 edition of her {{autobiography}} My Life that “It {{is not only a}} matter, I believe, of religious observance and practice. To me, being Jewish means and has always meant being proud {{to be part of a}} people that has maintained its distinct identity for more than 2,000 years, with all the pain and torment that has been inflicted upon it.” Meir strongly identified with Judaism culturally, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to her religious beliefs she was an atheist.|$|E

The idea that peoples who possessed cultural customs and racial appearances strikingly different from those of the colonizing power is no new idea borne out of the Medieval period or the Enlightenment.|$|E

25|$|In the 1930s, Armand Denis made {{films that}} {{told the world}} about Africa. However, his {{documentary}} gave fanciful stories about Rwanda's Tutsis being a noble ruling elite originally from Egypt, whereas the Hutus were a peasant race. In reality, they were racially the same, and the Belgian rulers had ruthlessly exploited the myth. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to independence, liberal Belgians felt guilty, and decided the Hutus should overthrow the Tutsi rule. This led to a bloodbath, as the Tutsis were then seen as aliens and were slaughtered.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{initially}} {{had nearly}} 5,000 colonials at his command, but General William Shirley, {{the governor of}} Massachusetts who had been commissioned to lead a simultaneous expedition to Fort Niagara, shifted some of Johnson's men and resources to his own campaign. Tensions escalated as the two generals worked {{against each other in}} recruiting Native allies. The dispute was complicated by the unusual command structure: as Braddock's second-in-command, General Shirley was Johnson's superior officer, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to Indian affairs, Johnson was theoretically in charge. In time, Shirley would blame the failure of his expedition on Johnson's refusal to provide him with adequate Indian support. According to the Johnson biographer Milton Hamilton, historians usually portrayed Johnson as acting unreasonably in the controversy with Shirley, but Hamilton argued that Johnson was reacting to Shirley's clumsy Indian diplomacy, which harmed the British relationship with the Six Nations.|$|E
25|$|During the {{campaign}} for the Act of Union, both Castlereagh and Cornwallis had, in good faith, forwarded informal assurances they had received from Pitt's Cabinet to the Irish Catholics {{that they would be}} allowed to sit in Parliament. Both Castlereagh and Cornwallis knew Catholic emancipation would be critical if their objectives for Union were to be realised. Emancipation was, however, opposed by much of the British establishment, including George III, who was convinced that it would violate his royal oath as protector of the Protestant faith. Pitt tried to follow through on his commitment, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to light that the King had approached Henry Addington, an opponent of Catholic emancipation, about becoming Prime Minister to replace the pro-emancipation Pitt, both Castlereagh and Pitt resigned in protest. Castlereagh would long be held personally responsible by many Catholics in Ireland for the breach of promise and the British Government's betrayal of their rights.|$|E

500|$|Gillan had {{substantial}} {{input into}} Amy's costume, {{as well as}} her hair and make-up. In the first episode, Holman stated that Amy's identity was not clear and she wore her own clothes later on. Gillan thought that Amy had inner confidence to wear clothes that showed [...] "a bit of skin from time to time". She tried on many things, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to short skirts she [...] "just thought it was right" [...] and showed that Amy was [...] "comfortable and confident about her look". She believed that the skirts reflected what young women typically wear at her age. Executive producer Piers Wenger also noted that Amy's 1970s flying jacket, which she wears [...] "quite a lot", reflected Gillan was a [...] "born adventurer" [...] and Amy developed a love for travel and adventure.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{had been}} {{expected}} to adhere to Whig Party policies and to defer to party congressional leaders, particularly Clay. When Tyler succeeded him, he initially concurred with the new Whig Congress, signing into law the preemption bill granting [...] "squatters' sovereignty" [...] to settlers on public land, a Distribution Act (discussed below), a new bankruptcy law, and {{the repeal of the}} Independent Treasury. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to the great banking question, Tyler was soon at odds with the Congressional Whigs, and twice vetoed Clay's legislation for a national banking act. Although the second bill was originally tailored to meet his objections in the first veto, its final version did not. This practice, designed to protect Clay from having a successful incumbent president as a rival for the Whig nomination in 1844, became known as [...] "heading Captain Tyler", a term coined by Whig Representative John Minor Botts of Virginia. Tyler proposed an alternative fiscal plan known as the [...] "Exchequer", but Clay's friends who controlled the Congress would have none of it.|$|E
500|$|McMahan {{reflected}} on the album's success: [...] "We worked really hard on Spiderland. I mean, I definitely felt much more personal about it. I thought it represented us as people, musically, {{a lot more than}} Tweez did. That's about it. It seemed like when we were around, and actively playing and stuff, that people's responses to us were fairly ambivalent. I thought it was funny when the press picked up on it. For an independent release, it had a strange sort of audience and kept selling three or four years after we recorded it; it still sells more copies than when it first came out." [...] Touch and Go founder Corey Rusk said that Spiderland is [...] "like an icon now. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> out, nobody cared! The band had broken up by the time the album came out, and it really didn't sell particularly well or get written about all that much in the year it was released. But it was a revolutionary, groundbreaking record, and it's one of the few instances where people catch up to it later on."

500|$|Muddy Waters {{recorded}} After the Rain {{the following}} year, incorporating {{elements of the}} sound of Electric Mud. According to Cosey, [...] "I'll never forget, as soon as I walked into the studio for the follow-up and Muddy saw me, he threw his arms around me, said 'Hey, how you doing, boy, play some of that stuff you played on that last album.'" [...] Following strong criticism of the album, Muddy Waters claimed that he disliked the album and its sound, {{and that he did}} not consider the album to be blues. He stated, [...] "Every time I go into Chess, [...] put some un-blues players with me [...] If you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man." [...] In the biography The Mojo Man, Muddy Waters stated [...] "That Electric Mud record was dogshit. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> out, it started selling like wild, but then they started sending them back. They said, 'This can't be Muddy Waters with all this shit going on, all this wha-wha and fuzztone.'" [...] AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger panned the album as being [...] "crass".|$|E

O'Reilly described Naomi as having a [...] "good heart", <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to getting what she wants, some of her actions were [...] "questionable". She also said Naomi was good at turning a situation to her advantage, and likened her to a cat, as she enjoys the [...] "finer things in life". The actress continued, [...] "On top of all that, she is her mother's daughter. She has the Canning straight up, strength and vulgarity that her genes and upbringing have given her in spades. She's quirky but sophisticated, and at times petulant and silly. All in all, she is very, very fun to play." [...] O'Reilly did not think Naomi was bad, but she was spoilt and always tried to get her own way. However, underneath the surface, she was kind and caring. When asked whether viewers would like Naomi, O'Reilly believed that she could turn out to be a [...] "character everyone loves to hate".|$|E
