His early {{association}} with churches, through his father, gave him an interest in ecclesiastical music; he often played the harmonium to entertain himself and his family. He had strong views on organ music, and once he had formed an opinion he rarely changed his mind.|$|E
5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E
5|$|The revolt in East Anglia was {{independently}} {{suppressed by}} Henry le Despenser, the Bishop of Norwich. Henry was in Stamford in Lincolnshire when the revolt broke out, {{and when he}} found out about it he marched south with eight men-at-arms and a small force of archers, gathering more forces as he went. He marched first to Peterborough, where he routed the local rebels and executed any he could capture, including some who had taken shelter in the local abbey. He then headed south-east via Huntingdon and Ely, reached Cambridge on 19 June, and then headed further into the rebel-controlled areas of Norfolk. Henry reclaimed Norwich on 24 June, before heading out with a company of men to track down the rebel leader, Geoffrey Litster. The two forces met at the Battle of North Walsham on 25 or 26 June; the Bishop's forces triumphed and Litster was captured and executed. Henry's quick action was essential to the suppression of the revolt in East Anglia, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> unusual in taking matters into his own hands in this way, and his execution of the rebels without royal sanction was illegal.|$|E

25|$|In September 1835, Nicolás Gutiérrez was {{appointed}} as interim governor of California in January 1836, {{to be replaced}} by Mariano Chico in April, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> unpopular. Thinking a revolt was coming, Chico returned to Mexico to gather troops, but was reprimanded for leaving his post. Gutierrez, the military commandant, re-assumed the governorship, but he too was unpopular. Senior members of Alta California's legislature Juan Bautista Alvarado and José Castro, with support from Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, Comandante of the Fourth Military District and Director of Colonization of the Northern Frontier, and assistance from a group of Americans led by Isaac Graham, staged a revolt in November 1836 and forced Gutierrez to relinquish power. The Americans wanted Californian independence, but Alvarado instead preferred staying part of Mexico, albeit with greater autonomy.|$|E

500|$|W. G. Grace is {{believed}} to have considered retirement from cricket before the 1878 season after he was seriously injured in a shooting accident the previous autumn which nearly cost him the sight of an eye. Having recovered, he reconsidered and in 1878 played in 33 matches, 24 of which are generally recognised as first-class. His main roles in the season were captain of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club and both match organiser and captain of the United South of England Eleven (USEE). In addition, he represented Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players fixture and the South in the North v South series. 1878 was a cold, wet summer and not one of Grace's better seasons as a batsman, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> effective in such conditions as a right arm medium pace roundarm bowler and completed a sixth successive [...] "double" [...] by scoring 1,151 runs and taking 152 wickets in the recognised first-class matches.|$|E
500|$|Gopalakrishan wanted fresh faces {{for both}} the lead roles and he had written letters to various heads of colleges and {{universities}} for the auditions. However, he did not receive any response from anywhere. For the female lead, Gopalakrishnan approached Sharada, {{one of the most successful}} actresses of her time. She was acting in commercial films when Gopalakrishnan asked her to star in Swayamvaram. Sharada was initially reluctant to commit herself to an art film, but agreed when Gopalakrishnan narrated the complete story to her at Prasad Studios, in Chennai. The male lead for the film, Madhu, was an old friend of Gopalakrishnan and had expressed a desire to act in one of his films. By the time Gopalakrishnan finished his studies and returned from FTII, Madhu was already a star in Malayalam cinema. Gopalakrishnan then decided to cast him opposite Sharada. Mentioning about his experience working with Gopalakrishnan and Swayamvaram, Madhu recollected in an interview that [...] " [...] when Gopalakrishnan narrated the story of Swayamvaram, I knew it was going to be different."

2500|$|In 1930, Vladimir Zworykin, who {{had been}} {{developing}} his own all-electronic television system at Westinghouse in Pittsburgh since 1923, but which {{he had never been}} able to make work or satisfactorily demonstrate to his superiors, was recruited by RCA to lead its television development department. Before leaving his old employer, Zworykin visited Farnsworth's laboratory and was sufficiently impressed with the performance of the Image Dissector that he reportedly had his team at Westinghouse make several copies of the device for experimentation. But Zworykin later abandoned research on the Image Dissector, which at the time required extremely bright illumination of its subjects to be effective, and turned his attention to what would become the Iconoscope. In a 1970s series of videotaped interviews, Zworykin recalled that, [...] "Farnsworth was closer to this thing you're using now [...] than anybody, because he used the cathode-ray tube for transmission. But, Farnsworth didn't have the mosaic , he didn't have storage. Therefore, [...] definition was very low.... <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> proud, and he stuck to his method."

2500|$|The October {{issue of}} Star of the West made room for remembering him while news {{continued}} of `Abdu'l-Bahá's travels and speeches and {{dedication of the}} cite for the Bahá'í House of Worship near Chicago. It included a long poem Chase composed. This poem arrived in Egypt and was read to `Abdu'l-Bahá July 4, 1913. The Star of the West edition also published letters from various communities memorializing him. Tributes from Portland, OR and Chicago were also published, followed in March, 1913, by one from Beirut which included remembrance {{of those who were}} on pilgrimage and met him in 1907. A letter/poem/ode from him to `Abdu'l-Bahá was published in September, 1913 dated from August, 1912, published as a one year anniversary of the visit of `Abdu'l-Baha to his gravesite and was re-printed in 1922. The editors noted the observance held for what was called [...] "The day of Thornton Chase". It also reported more of the words `Abdu'l-Bahá had said on the visit to the gravesite:"…During his lifetime he bore many trials and vicissitudes, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> patient and long-suffering. He had a heart most illuminated, a spirit most rejoiced; his hope was to serve the world of humanity; during the days of his life he strove {{as much as he could}} – he never failed…" [...] There was an article then published including a picture marking Chase among the people standing at a Ridván meeting in May, 1909, who lead the services that day and compared the tent raised as a precursor to the eventual building. It also included a short article by Chase [...] "The Greatest Name". An account of that first year anniversary followed in the November edition. 10 Bahá'ís attended the gravesite Sep 30th with flowers and prayers for an hour and a service was held the following Sunday in a hall which was also the anniversary of `Abdu'l-Bahá's visit and the assemblage again returned to the gravesite at sunset. A memorial comment was then published from Thomas Kelly Cheyne. In February 1914, an excerpt from Chase's book The Bahai Revelation was published in Star of the West. The anniversary was noted again in 1914, and then an article briefly reviewing the history of the religion in America by Chase was published in early 1915, and again noted the anniversary in September. A more enduring gravestone was placed in 1918. A memoriam article in 1918 noted 21 Bahá'ís attended the anniversary meeting which also saw the new stone marker. Mrs. Chase attended and shared anecdotes of his life. A picture of the gravestone was published in 1920.|$|E
