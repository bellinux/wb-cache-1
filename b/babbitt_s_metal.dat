Results on the measurement of interfacial area per volume (IAV) in this natural three-dimensional porous medium by the method of image analysis are presented. In Wood 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>metal</b> injection experiments, Wood 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>metal</b> was used to represent a non-wetting fluid and ethylene glycol (EG) was used to represent a wetting phase fluid. To determine the IAV for a Wood 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>metal</b> injected sample, images of the Wood 2 ̆ 7 s-metal-injected core were taken with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). This is the first attempt to perform IAV measurements within Berea sandstone based on a large quantity of SEM images. ^ Measurements were performed on two-dimensional micro-models to quantify interfacial area per volume for known pore geometry {{as a function of}} fluid pressure and saturation. The transparent micro-models make it possible to visualize and quantify the fluid distributions within the samples and study the detailed capillary pressure-saturation-IAV relationship of each micro-model. The results have shown that as porosity increases, the hysteresis of IAV-saturation relationship decreases. The difference between the drainage and imbibition surfaces from the same sample is small. The theoretical capillary pressure values based on a theoretical equation cannot fit the measured values well and changes need to be made to this equation. ...|$|R

The melt flow and distribution were observed for both the experiments with a high-speed video camera.

We show that ferromagnetic exchange field pair breaking effect leads to a formation of subgap bands in the S layer local density of states, that accommodate only one spin-polarized quasiparticles. Equilibrium magnetization leakage into the S layer as function of SF interface quality and a value of ferromagnetic interaction have also been calculated. We show that a damped-oscillatory behavior versus distance from SF interface is a distinguished feature of the exchange-induced magnetization of the S layer.

By implementing multiple contact with a sufficiently high inter-contact resistance, discrete switching between different angles can be obtained by selectively pumping current to different contact (gain-guiding effect), while fine-tuning of a given angle can be achieved by adjusting the injection current of nearby contacts (index-guiding effect).

In this case transport properties are similar for the S/DW/S and S/DW/N junctions and are controlled by sequential tunneling of spatially separated Cooper pairs across the domain wall. In the absence of inelastic scattering we find that a Josephson current circulates only if the size of the ferromagnetic region is smaller than the elastic mean free path meaning that the Josephson effect associated to crossed Andreev reflection cannot be observed under usual experimental conditions. Nevertheless a finite dc current can circulate across the S/DW/S junction due to crossed Andreev reflection associated to sequential tunneling.
