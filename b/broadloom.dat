40|$|The modular {{flooring}} system (MFS) {{was developed to}} provide a portable, modular, durable carpeting solution for NASA fs Robotics Alliance Project fs (RAP) outreach efforts. It was also designed to improve and replace a modular {{flooring system}} that was too heavy for safe use and transportation. The MFS was developed for use as the flooring for various robotics competitions that RAP utilizes to meet its mission goals. One of these competitions, the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), currently uses two massive rolls of <b>broadloom</b> carpet for {{the foundation of the}} arena in which the robots are contained during the competition. The area of the arena is approximately 30 by 72 ft (approximately 9 by 22 m). This carpet is very cumbersome and requires large-capacity vehicles, and handling equipment and personnel to transport and deploy. The <b>broadloom</b> carpet sustains severe abuse from the robots during a regular three-day competition, and as a result, the carpet is not used again for competition. Similarly, <b>broadloom</b> carpets used for trade shows at convention centers around the world are typically discarded after only one use. This innovation provides a green solution to this wasteful practice. Each of the flooring modules in the previous system weighed 44 lb (. 20 kg). The improvements in the overall design of the system reduce the weight of each module by approximately 22 lb (. 10 kg) (50 %), and utilize an improved "module-to-module" connection method that is superior to the previous system. The MFS comprises 4 -by- 4 -ft (. 1. 2 -by- 1. 2 -m) carpet module assemblies that utilize commercially available carpet tiles that are bonded to a lightweight substrate. The substrate surface opposite from the carpeted surface has a module-to-module connecting interface that allows for the modules to be connected, one to the other, as the modules are constructed. This connection is hidden underneath the modules, creating a smooth, co-planar flooring surface. The modules are stacked and strapped onto durable, commercially available drywall carts for storage and/or transportation. This method of storage and transportation makes it very convenient and safe when handling large quantities of modules...|$|E
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of the {{research}} was to develop the next generation, generic construction of <b>broadloom</b> carpet that will compete on both a performance and cost basis with the current construction while avoiding the major recycling disadvantages of the latter. The new construction was designed to maintain {{nearly all of the}} current carpet formation processes to minimize capital investment in converting existing manufacturing lines. A major industry constriction was that the new construction must at least meet the current construction's physical performance on the floor and overall cost characteristics. M. S.

40|$|John Canton {{is known}} mainly {{for his work}} in electrostatics but, as this article shows, he carried out {{important}} work in many other branches of physics, including making magnets and demonstrating the compressibility of water. John Canton (figure 1), the son of a Stroud <b>broadloom</b> weaver, rose by sheer ability and determination to become a Fellow of the Royal Society, a member of its Council, and was twice awarded the coveted Copley Medal of the Society. He was described by Joseph Priestley as one of the ‘four most eminent electricians ’ of the period and {{he became one of the}} most respected physicists of his generation, a close friend of, and correspondent with, such figures as Benjamin Franklin, Joseph Priestley and Henry Cavendish. Yet despite the tributes and recognition of his contemporaries, Canton has remained a largely unknown and forgotten figure in the history of science. Recently, however, there have been indications that Canton’s work has at last been given its due recognition; in 1994 the Educatio...|$|E
40|$|The XYZ Corporation is {{headquartered}} in Dalton, GA. It {{is a full}} service flooring company with approximately 30, 000 employees. The company sells woven and tufted <b>broadloom</b> carpet and other flooring products in Canada, Mexico and the U. S., and exports worldwide. One of their projects is to develop an improve d packaging design, which will help in streamlining the internal packaging and distribution process. The aim {{of this research is}} to eliminate waste and improve the use of shipping pallets {{to reduce the amount of}} footprint used by applying techniques of lean manufacturing systems. To understand the existing packaging method, a flow diagram was created. Non-value added functions were identified by applying aspects of lean principles. The existing model is identified with four kinds of waste: Overprocessing, Transportation, Waiting, and Inventory. With the improvement of the packaging model, it aided in eliminating those kinds of wastes. The research further addresses the related effects from overprocessing and transportation in our environment. Based on the study, the necessary recommendations are provided to restructure packaging, which will lead to improved distributio...|$|E
40|$|Mitigation {{of health}} and heat-build-up issues related to black, {{granulated}} crumb rubber infill (GCRI) in synthetic turf fields (STF) while maintaining acceptable impact absorption properties was the central goal of this study. The first step was establishing a STF baseline performance of GCRI samples that originated from several sources while elucidating the synergistic parameters between infill and turf that promulgate acceptable impact performance. Based on the knowledge base built on the GCRI-STF standard, three polymeric waste streams selected for their benign chemical contents, non-black colors and competitive low costs were evaluated as alternate turf infill materials: post-consumer carpet <b>broadloom</b> (PCCB), post-consumer carpet tile (PCCT) and recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) drink bottles. For ground PCCB carcass (the base on the carpet construction remaining after the face fibers were removed), the heterogeneous composition of unconfined fine particles and remaining short fibers prevented sufficient material integration to allow sufficient impact energy absorption. The ground PET homogeneous particles alone lacked sufficient impact absorption capabilities, and their synergistic interactions with the turf blade yarns were not sufficient to meet specified levels of impact performance. Only the PCCT infill crumb possessed a heterogeneous structure that effectively filled the STF to yield sufficient impact cushioning comparable to standard GCRI. In conclusion, PCCT was {{shown to be a}} technically-viable candidate for GCRI infill replacement, warranting further development to bring it into closer cost competitiveness to GCRI and ensure long-term wear and weathering performance in synthetic turf.
