5|$|Realms, {{released}} in 1991 for DOS, Amiga and Atari ST, had a medieval theme, with melee and ranged units, and allowed gamers to resolve combat automatically or in a RTS-type style. Warcraft: Orcs & Humans {{was the first}} typical RTS to <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> a medieval setting, and its units included spellcasters as well as melee and ranged units.|$|E
5|$|An {{outgrowth}} of Jackson's trip was {{the realization that}} the National Park Service does not represent the underlying issue of slavery contextually in its battlefield displays and presentations. Instead of presenting the battles as political and moral issues, Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> a more forward way. As a result, in 2000, he recrafted the United States Department of the Interior's appropriation to include a directive to have United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt use his influence over the superintendents of the national parks to encourage greater inclusion of slavery and social issues in Civil War presentations.|$|E

5|$|Docter {{began working}} on the story in 2004, {{which was based on}} fantasies of {{escaping}} from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela gathering research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth. The floating house is attached by a varying number between 10,000 and 20,000 balloons in the film's sequences. Up was Pixar's first film to <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> Disney Digital 3-D.|$|E
5|$|During the women's class F35/36 discus competition, {{an error}} in scoring caused the wrong medals to <b>be</b> <b>presented.</b> <b>In</b> this {{combined}} class event, final standings were determined based on a points calculation. The calculation converted distances thrown into points, {{to account for the}} different functional impairments of the participating athletes. Due to {{an error in}} the scoring system, the gold medal in the event was originally awarded to Ukrainian athlete Mariia Pomazan. When the mistake was discovered, the recalculated points showed that Chinese athlete Wu Qing had finished first, with Pomazan in second place. A second medal ceremony was held, which Pomazan did not attend in protest. She was eventually required to return her gold medal.|$|E
5|$|Parts of the {{libretto}} {{are considered}} analogous with the libretto for Giovanni Pacini's Adelaide e Comingio, {{and the final}} scene {{is based on the}} François-Thomas-Marie de Baculard d'Arnaud play Les Amants malheureux, ou le comte de Comminges. Donizetti worked on the opera in late 1839—its final page is dated 27 December 1839. Because the subject matter involved the mistress of a Neapolitan king, and may thus have caused difficulties with the Italian censors, Donizetti decided that the opera should <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> France. The theater company Donizetti contracted went bankrupt; L'ange was never performed and was reworked as La favorite in September 1840.|$|E

5|$|The larvae are {{themselves}} eaten by various {{animals such as}} carnivorous invertebrates and water birds, and are especially vulnerable to predatory fish. Adults generally avoid predators through their hidden lifestyle but are sometimes eaten by herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and mammals such as shrews, badgers and hedgehogs. They secrete the poison tetrodotoxin from their skin, albeit much less than for example the North American Pacific newts (Taricha). The bright yellow or orange underside of crested newts is a warning coloration which can <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> case of perceived danger. In such a posture, the newts typically roll up and secrete a milky substance.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} {{twenty years of}} its existence, the only staged {{performances}} of Parsifal {{took place in the}} Bayreuth Festspielhaus, the venue for which Wagner conceived the work (except eight private performances for Ludwig II at Munich in 1884 and 1885). Wagner had two reasons for wanting to keep Parsifal exclusively for the Bayreuth stage. Firstly, he wanted to prevent it from degenerating into 'mere amusement' for an opera-going public. Only at Bayreuth could his last work <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> the way envisaged by him – a tradition maintained by his wife, Cosima, long after his death. Secondly, he thought that the opera would provide an income for his family after his death if Bayreuth had the monopoly on its performance.|$|E

25|$|Multi-voxel {{spectroscopy}} {{provides information}} about group of voxels and data can <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> 2D or 3D images, but it requires longer acquisition times and therefore temporal resolution is decreased. Multi-voxel spectroscopy usually is performed when the specific volume {{of interest is}} not known or {{it is important to}} study metabolite dynamics in a larger brain region.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{objects are}} portrayed with a disciplined {{graphical}} precision. They {{are separated from}} their usual surroundings either to stand alone, or to <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> an artistically engineered context surrounded by ethereal space. The luminescent contrasting colours distort the materiality of the objects and confound the viewer. Frames {{in the style of}} those from times gone by form an essential part of each picture.|$|E
25|$|Tufte {{encourages}} {{the use of}} data-rich illustrations that present all available data.

25|$|Use of {{the data}} bus is {{intricate}} and thus requires a complex DRAM controller circuit. This is because data written to the DRAM must <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> the same cycle as the write command, but reads produce output 2 or 3 cycles after the read command. The DRAM controller must ensure that the data bus is never required for a read and a write at the same time.|$|E
25|$|The data must {{be related}} to the {{functional}} unit defined in the goal and scope definition. Data can <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> tables and some interpretations can be made already at this stage.
