25|$|Bourque, Cam Neely and Keith Crowder led the Bruins {{to another}} Cup Final {{appearance}} in 1988 against the Edmonton Oilers. The Bruins {{lost in a}} four-game sweep, but a memorable moment in the would-be fourth game ensued, when {{in the second period}} with the game tied 3–3, a <b>blown</b> <b>fuse</b> put the lights out at the Boston Garden. The rest of the game was cancelled and the series shifted to Edmonton. The Oilers completed the sweep, 6–3, back at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in what was originally scheduled as Game Five. The event is considered to be the reason the Bruins began work on a new arena. Boston returned to the Stanley Cup Final in 1990 (with Neely, Bourque, Craig Janney, Bobby Carpenter, and rookie Don Sweeney, and former Oiler goalie Andy Moog and Reggie Lemelin splitting goaltending duties), but again lost to the Oilers, this time in five games.|$|E

2500|$|Wild Oats XI won line honours for {{the fifth}} time in the 2010 race, {{although}} the yacht's crew faced a protest against their win which could have resulted in disqualification. Under sailing instruction 44.1(A), yachts are required to report their position by radio as they pass Green Cape, the entrance to Bass Strait. The rule was created following the disastrous 1998 race in which five boats sank and six sailors died. As the yacht passed the cape, the crew realised that a <b>blown</b> <b>fuse</b> had rendered their high-frequency radio non-functional. They reported their position to race organisers via satellite phone, but race officials forwarded a complaint to an international jury, alleging that the crew had violated what race committee chairman Tim Cox called [...] "one of the fundamental safety rules of the Sydney to Hobart yacht race". The complaint was dismissed by the jury, and Wild Oats XI was awarded its fifth Sydney to Hobart line honours.|$|E

50|$|In {{percolation}} theory, random fuse {{networks have}} been studied. The current density {{might be too}} low in some areas, and too strong in others.

It is difficult for humans to predict the long term patterns in complex networks, so fuse or diode networks are used instead.|$|R

[...] Normal fast-blow fuses are the most general purpose fuses.

50|$|In March 2004 the four-piece won {{a statewide}} band competition, Push-On, in Melbourne. Their early {{material}} {{was influenced by}} Australian rock bands AC/DC, The Angels, Billy Thorpe and Rose Tattoo. They recorded an eight-track extended play, Ready to Rock, which appeared in July 2004 as an independent self-funded release. By that time Jacobson was replaced by Justin Street (born c. 1986) on bass guitar - Ryan had met Street while stumbling home drunk from a party one night. In early 2005, the band relocated to Melbourne and in August, they signed a five album record deal with Capitol Records. According to Joel, while the band {{were living in a}} shared house they threw a party, and during listening to a Krokus CD, Rock the Block, a <b>blown</b> <b>fuse</b> resulted in a fire burning the back part of the house.
