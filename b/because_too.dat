5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics <b>because</b> <b>too</b> much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 a Maryland court ordered him to pay the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes he had taken while a public employee. Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. He was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public some insight into his recent business activities.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{computer}} simulations show the Kuiper belt {{to have been}} strongly influenced by Jupiter and Neptune, and also suggest that neither Uranus nor Neptune could have formed in their present positions, <b>because</b> <b>too</b> little primordial matter existed at that range to produce objects of such high mass. Instead, these planets are estimated to have formed closer to Jupiter. Scattering of planetesimals early in the Solar System's history would have led to migration of the orbits of the giant planets: Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune drifted outwards, whereas Jupiter drifted inwards. Eventually, the orbits shifted {{to the point where}} Jupiter and Saturn reached an exact 1:2 resonance; Jupiter orbited the Sun twice for every one Saturn orbit. The gravitational repercussions of such a resonance ultimately destabilized the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, causing them to be scattered outward onto high-eccentricity orbits that crossed the primordial planetesimal disc. While Neptune's orbit was highly eccentric, its mean-motion resonances overlapped and the orbits of the planetesimals evolved chaotically, allowing planetesimals to wander outward as far as Neptune's 1:2 resonance to form a dynamically cold belt of low-inclination objects. Later, after its eccentricity decreased, Neptune's orbit expanded outward toward its current position. Many planetesimals were captured into and remain in resonances during this migration, others evolved onto higher-inclination and lower-eccentricity orbits and escaped from the resonances onto stable orbits. Many more planetesimals were scattered inward, with small fractions being captured as Jupiter trojans, as irregular satellites orbiting the giant planets, and as outer belt asteroids. The remainder were scattered outward again by Jupiter and in most cases ejected from the Solar System reducing the primordial Kuiper belt population by 99% or more.|$|E
25|$|With the {{publication}} of the chimpanzee genome, plans to increase the use of chimps in labs are reportedly increasing, with some scientists arguing that the federal moratorium on breeding chimps for research should be lifted. A five-year moratorium was imposed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health in 1996, <b>because</b> <b>too</b> many chimps had been bred for HIV research, and it has been extended annually since 2001.|$|E

25|$|In April 2015, {{fluoride}} {{levels in}} the United States were lowered {{for the first time}} in 50 years, to the minimum recommended levels of 0.7ppm, <b>because</b> <b>too</b> much fluoride exposure has become a common issue for children teeth, visible in the form of white splotches. The basis were the results of two national surveys (1999–2004 NHANES) which assessed the prevalence of dental fluorosis, and found that two out of five adolescents had tooth streaking or spottiness on their teeth - an increase of mostly very mild or mild forms.|$|E
25|$|The soils {{closest to}} the plains of the Saône are too fertile, with patches of poorly drained soils, that make growing quality wine grapes difficult. As you move upwards along the cote {{escarpment}} the soil becomes progressively less fertile with higher proportions of the well-draining and highly porous oolitic limestone and less clay. At this elevation of around 800ft (250 m) most of the premier cru vineyards start to be found with areas of particularly favored location being designated as grand cru. The band of suitable soils for viticulture is narrow <b>because</b> <b>too</b> far up the hills (beyond 1000ft/300 m) the top soil becomes too thin to support vines.|$|E
25|$|Visual arts by {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas comprise a major category in the world art collection. Contributions include pottery, paintings, jewellery, weavings, sculptures, basketry, , and beadwork. <b>Because</b> <b>too</b> many artists were posing as Native Americans and Alaska Natives in order {{to profit from the}} cachet of Indigenous art in the United States, the U.S. passed the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, requiring artists to prove that they are enrolled in a state or federally recognized tribe. To support the ongoing practice of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian arts and cultures in the United States, the Ford Foundation, arts advocates and American Indian tribes created an endowment seed fund and established a national Native Arts and Cultures Foundation in 2007.|$|E

25|$|A {{derivative}} term {{does not}} consider the error (meaning it cannot bring it to zero: a pure D controller cannot bring the system to its setpoint), but {{the rate of change}} of error, trying to bring this rate to zero. It aims at flattening the error trajectory into a horizontal line, damping the force applied, and so reduces overshoot (error on the other side <b>because</b> <b>too</b> great applied force). Applying too much impetus when the error is small and is reducing will lead to overshoot. After overshooting, if the controller were to apply a large correction in the opposite direction and repeatedly overshoot the desired position, the output would oscillate around the setpoint in either a constant, growing, or decaying sinusoid. If the amplitude of the oscillations increase with time, the system is unstable. If they decrease, the system is stable. If the oscillations remain at a constant magnitude, the system is marginally stable.|$|E
25|$|It was Muzzarelli who conferred upon Goaziou the Degrees of the Scottish Rite {{up to the}} 30th. Muzzarelli named Goaziou {{his deputy}} in early 1907. Unfortunately, the two men fell out over mutual charges of {{financial}} irregularity combined with personal dislike. The Order also was in disarray <b>because</b> <b>too</b> many Lodges had been founded too quickly. The new Order also experienced external pressures, including persecution by the existing Male-Only Orders in the US. In the fall of 1908, Muzzarelli was pressured to call {{what remained of the}} Lodges he founded, just less than half, to a convention in St. Louis, Missouri. Tragically, Muzzarelli, who in addition to pressures in the Order also had many personal problems, committed suicide October 15, 1908. Though Goaziou made it plain he would prefer the presidency go to another Co-Mason, it was Goaziou who took charge of the financial and administrative affairs of the lodges, and who was elected President at the convention in St. Louis.|$|E

500|$|Lorraine Calvert {{joined the}} series as costume {{designer}} for the season. On adapting Elektra's costume for the season, {{which in the}} comics usually consists of impractically [...] "strappy" [...] red cloth, Calvert decided to make it utilitarian and appealing, while still being faithful to the comics. Originally starting out opposite of the eventual sleek design for both her fighting and daytime attire, Calvert said, [...] "Ideas were tossed around about how she was possibly bohemian, [...] she was a free spirit who traveled {{all over the world}} with as much money as she possibly could." [...] This eventually led to the final, sleeker design, because Elektra [...] "really needs a very simple, elegant line <b>because</b> <b>too</b> much cloth is overwhelming." [...] The costume consisted of [...] "black moto pants, a one-piece zippered body suit, a sleeveless vest, and red cloth to provide the highlights and the hood covering Elektra’s face." [...] The shade of the red used for Elektra throughout the season was chosen so it would not clash with the red in Daredevil's costume, as well as to match the darker tone of the series.|$|E
500|$|Voluntary {{employment}} increased sharply during 1940 and 1941, both among indigenous {{blacks and}} migrant labourers, but many white farmers still complained about {{a lack of}} manpower. A severe drought during the 1941–42 season led to a food shortage in the colony, prompting the passing in June 1942 of the Compulsory Native Labour Act, under which unemployed black males between 18 and 45 years of age could be conscripted for work on white-owned farms. Announcing the act, Tredgold—by now Minister of Native Affairs in addition to Defence and Justice—commented that its [...] "principle... would be intolerable under ordinary circumstances", but that the war made it necessary. The act required each draftee to work at least three months at [...] per month; the pay rose to [...] if he agreed to stay a further three months. This conscription of labour contributed to {{the rise in the}} country's overall agricultural yield, but had a negative impact on the localised production of many kraals, either <b>because</b> <b>too</b> many men had been drafted for work elsewhere or because they had fled to avoid it. The scheme continued until the act's repeal in 1946.|$|E
