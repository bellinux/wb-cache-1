50|$|Aporia crataegi, the <b>black-veined</b> <b>white,</b> {{is a large}} {{butterfly}} of {{the family}} Pieridae.|$|E

50|$|Aporia, the <b>black-veined</b> <b>whites</b> or blackveins, is a genus of pierid {{butterflies}} {{found in}} the Palearctic region.|$|R
50|$|Dixeia leucophanes, the spotless <b>black-veined</b> small <b>white,</b> is a {{butterfly}} in the Pieridae family. It {{is found in}} Zambia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The habitat consists of forests and heavy woodland.|$|R
50|$|Dixeia doxo, the <b>black-veined</b> <b>white,</b> is a {{butterfly}} in the Pieridae family and {{is native to}} southern Africa.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black-veined</b> <b>white</b> has a {{wingspan}} of 51 to 70 mm. Females {{are commonly}} larger than males. The upperside of both forewings and hindwings is a translucent white boldly veined with black. The underside {{is similar in}} the male but the female has brown veining. Moreover, the female loses most of her scales by rubbing her wings together, resulting almost-transparent.|$|E
50|$|The flight {{period of}} the <b>black-veined</b> <b>white</b> is between April and July. The adults are quite social and their {{abundance}} varies greatly from year to year. The eggs are laid on the food plant, usually {{a member of the}} rose family Rosaceae and often on trees and bushes (Malus domestica, Malus micromalus, Pyrus communis, Pyrus serotina, Sorbus intermedia, Sorbus hybrida, Sorbus aucuparia, Crataegus monogyna, Crataegus oxyacantha, Crataegus jozana, Prunus spinosa, Prunus padus, Prunus ssiori, Betula spp., Salix phylicifolia, Chaenomeles lagenaria).|$|E
50|$|Rare and {{exquisite}} {{materials on}} each of the floors of the building include a range of imported marble, such as Carrara and Yellow Siena from Italy, Pacific Coast Salmon Pink, and Red Numidian from North Africa. The grand first-floor hall, accessible through massive bronze doors, is paneled in <b>black-veined</b> <b>white</b> Italian marble trimmed in green marble from Maryland and Vermont. Marble mosaics adorn the groin-vaulted ceiling. The floor is composed of ceramic-tile mosaic. Stained-glass domes ringed with marble-mosaic tile eagles enhance the rotundas {{at each end of the}} hall.|$|E
50|$|The main hall {{spans the}} width of the {{building}} along its principal elevation. It is very similar in design and ornamentation to the main hall of the United States Supreme Court building, which Gilbert designed at the same time. Variations on the decorative motifs employed within the main hall appear {{throughout the rest of the}} interior. Twenty-nine feet in height, it has green- and <b>black-veined</b> <b>white</b> marble floors; the white marble that lines its walls has gold- and cream-colored veining, providing a subtle but attractive contrast of warm and cool tones. Elaborate molding, featuring a meander (Greek key) design, divides the ceiling into rectangular, coffered sections. The coffers are decorated with large plaster rosettes tipped with 22k gold leaf on alternating backgrounds of crimson and peacock blue, with smaller rosettes at the junctions of the coffers.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{faunistic}} survey of Macrolepidoptera in Loučany (foothills of the Šumava Mts, Czech Republic). The research, involving different capture methods, proceeded from April to November 2015 on given transect and several other habitats. Based on the results (including partial data from 2013 and {{the last two decades}} of the 20 th century), an inventory of identified species of Macrolepidoptera was made. Altogether 205 species from 16 families were found in Loučany. The most important species are for example the <b>Black-veined</b> <b>White</b> (Aporia crataegi), High Brown Fritillary (Argynnis adippe), Pearl-bordered Fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), Purple Emperor (Apatura iris), Spruce Carpet (Thera britannica) and Sandy Carpet (Perizoma affinitata). The environmental parameters of experimental sites were noticed during research and the habitat preferences of species were analysed using specialized literature. Altogether 186 species (90, 7 % of all identified species) are linked to some kind of woodland habitat. To support present biodiversity of the community of Macrolepidoptera, it is necessary to practice a suitable woodland management, conserving mosaicity and open canopy.
