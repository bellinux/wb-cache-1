25|$|The era of {{inflation}} targeting—i.e. maintaining inflation within a band—has perhaps begun in Egypt more recently. Country experiences show that inflation targeting is a <b>best-practice</b> strategy for monetary policy. While the monetary policy appears {{more responsive to}} inflationary pressures recently in Egypt, {{it is noted that}} there is no core inflation measure and the Central Bank of Egypt takes targeting decisions based on the inflation rate released by the CAPMAS consumer price index off-the-shelf.|$|E
25|$|Special {{handling}} instructions for breakage are not {{printed on the}} packaging of household CFL bulbs in many countries. The amount of mercury released by one bulb can temporarily exceed U.S. federal guidelines for chronic exposure. Chronic, however, implies exposure for a significant time, and it remains unclear what the health risks are from short-term exposure to low levels of elemental mercury. Despite following EPA <b>best-practice</b> clean-up guidelines on broken CFLs, researchers were unable to remove mercury from carpet, and agitation of the carpet— such as by young children playing— created localized concentrations as high as 0.025mg/m3 in air close to the carpet, even weeks after the initial breakage.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a proposed <b>best-practices</b> {{system that will}} present expert knowledge {{in the use of}} CFD. The <b>best-practices</b> system will include specific guidelines to assist the user in problem definition, input preparation, grid generation, code selection, parameter specification, and results interpretation. The goal of the system is to assist all CFD users in obtaining high quality CFD solutions with reduced uncertainty and at lower cost {{for a wide range of}} flow problems. The <b>best-practices</b> system will be implemented as a software product which includes an expert system made up of knowledge databases of expert information with specific guidelines for individual codes and algorithms. The process of acquiring expert knowledge is discussed, and help from the CFD community is solicited. Benefits and challenges associated with this project are examined...|$|R

Child Care nutritional <b>best-practices</b> among child care providers in Washington. Methods: Data was collected from an online professional training module {{for child care}} providers. We examined providers’ knowledge of and behaviors {{they are willing to}} do to meet the <b>best-practices</b> by program type and size, provider experience, and written nutrition policy status. Concerns for implementation were analyzed through qualitative thematic analysis. Results: The final sample included 668 providers. Providers knew most <b>best-practices</b> (88. 2 %- 98. 8 %), but had lower levels of knowledge about sugary drinks (47. 6 %) and milk type (65. 7 %). Concerns for implementation included practical concerns, dealing with picky eaters, and parents not supporting child care nutrition efforts. Conclusions and Implications: Sugary drinks and milk type recommendations are target areas for future interventions and research among child care providers. More research is needed about how to best integrate parents with child care nutrition efforts...|$|R

[...] A project was commissioned in 2003 by the CARICOM Secretariat with a grant from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). The object of the project was to support CARICOM in its efforts to establish an effective regional regime for Public Procurement which would facilitate the full implementation of the CSME and to participate effectively in external trade negotiations relating to Public Procurement. [...] The project comprised three main components. [...] Component 1 – National Government Procurement Frameworks: Analysis, Comparison and Recommended Improvements; Component 2 – Collection and Analysis of Government Procurement Statistics; and Component 3 – Recommendations for a Regional <b>Best-practice</b> Regime for Government Procurement.|$|E
2500|$|Doctors and {{hospitals}} are generally funded by payments from patients and insurance plans {{in return for}} services rendered (fee-for-service or FFS). In the FFS payment model, each service provided is billed as an individual item, which creates an incentive to provide more services (e.g., more tests, more expensive procedures, and more medicines). This {{is in contrast to}} bundled payments, in which the amount the insurer will pay to the service providers is bundled per episode (e.g., for a heart attack patient, a total amount will be paid to the network providing the care for say 180 days). Bundling on a per patient basis (rather than per-episode) was referred to in the 1990's as a [...] "capitated payment" [...] but is now described as an accountable care organization. Bundling provides an incentive to lower costs, which requires offsetting measures and incentives for quality of care. Several <b>best-practice</b> healthcare systems, such as the Kaiser and Mayo health systems, use bundled payments.|$|E

50|$|Acceptable {{risk level}} {{is not the}} same as {{personal}} acceptance of risk, but it refers to risk acceptability by stakeholders’ community or by society in a broad sense. Acceptable risk levels vary from system to system, and evolve with time due to socio-economic changes and technological advancement. Implementing proven <b>best-practices</b> at status-of-art is a prerequisite for achieving an acceptable risk level, or in other words to make a system safe. <b>Best-practices</b> are traditionally established by government regulations and norms, and/or by industrial standards. Without such reference the term safety, or acceptable risk, becomes meaningless. In other words compliance with regulations, norms and standards represents the safety yardstick of a system.|$|R
