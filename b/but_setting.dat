Pottery and other cooking vessels may be placed directly on an open fire, <b>but</b> <b>setting</b> the vessel on a support, {{as simple as a}} base of three stones, resulted in a stove. The three-stone stove is still widely used around the world. In some areas it developed into a U-shaped dried mud or brick enclosure with the opening in the front for fuel and air, sometimes with a second smaller hole at the rear.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker {{gave the}} episode an A, posing the question: [...] "Has there {{ever been a}} TV show more aptly named than Glee? It both embodies and inspires exactly that quality." [...] Glee was the top ranked topic on social {{networking}} site Twitter {{on the night of}} its initial airing. Alessandra Stanley for The New York Times called the show [...] "blissfully unoriginal in a witty, imaginative way", saying the characters are [...] "high school archetypes" [...] but noted [...] "a strong satiric pulse that doesn’t diminish the characters’ identities or dim the showmanship of a talented cast". The Daily News David Hinckley wrote that the show [...] "isn't close to perfect" [...] but [...] "has likable characters, {{a good sense of humor}} and a reasonably deft touch with music." [...] He called the pilot episode [...] "not very plausible" [...] but [...] "potentially heartwarming", writing of the musical choices: [...] "The duet of [...] "You're the One That I Want" [...] from Grease may be a little obvious, <b>but</b> <b>setting</b> a group dance routine to Amy Winehouse's [...] "Rehab" [...] shows some inspiration. Whether Glee can hold that note remains a very unanswered question. But it will at least be worth watching to see." [...] USA Today Robert Bianco assessed: [...] "There's a lot to like here: the exuberance of the musical numbers, the bite to the comedy and the joy of seeing something different. It has casting and tone problems, but it has all summer to fix them." ...|$|E
500|$|During the mid-1980s, {{heavy metal}} music divided into {{autonomous}} subgenres. Weinstein (2000) described the [...] thematic diversity that cross-cuts musical styles: [...] "In the 1980s, white metal and black metal emerged. Their lyrical themes are at polar opposites to each other, {{one of them}} bringing the 'good news' and the other the 'bad news.' Both include bands whose sounds span {{the full spectrum of}} metal. White metal is commonly called Christian metal. In part a response to the popularity of the heavy metal genre, it transforms the code of heavy metal to serve purposes of Evangelical Christian sects and other denominations. In part, also, Christian metal is a well-crafted missionary effort to recruit members and save souls. [...] Black metal stands in the thematic opposition to Christianity, not looking upward to heaven <b>but</b> <b>setting</b> its sights on the underworld. Satanic symbols and imagery have been a staple of heavy metal since its beginnings with Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. In the West, there is no better symbol for rebellion. But groups such as Mercyful Fate claimed that they were not playing. Their claims to be true believers, followers of the lord of the underworld, were seen by many to be a commercial ploy." [...] Chicago Doom Metal group Trouble was known to be the first band that was publicly marketed as [...] "white metal" [...] since their early albums Psalm 9 and The Skull feature Biblical references. The origin of the [...] "white metal" [...] term remains unclear; it is merely known that the non-Christian label Metal Blade Records used [...] "white metal" [...] as a marketing term, in contrast to black metal.|$|E

2500|$|This {{was during}} a period of both strong White power structures, the first {{organizations}} of the NAACP in South Carolina, and spreading violence and intimidation, the [...] "resurgent" [...] Ku Klux Klan and moderate YMCA and YWCA organizations that kept an [...] "absolute loyalty to the principle of racial integrity." [...] Gregory made a trip through South Carolina from Wilmington NC in early 1919 before the April annual Bahá'í convention and during it the previous Tablets and some new ones were officially unveiled.

2500|$|Another way to {{calculate}} the risk dominant equilibrium is {{to calculate}} the risk factor for all equilibria and to find the equilibrium with the smallest risk factor. [...] To calculate the risk factor in our 2x2 game, consider [...] the expected payoff to a player if they play H: [...] (where p is {{the probability that the}} other player will play H), and compare it to the expected payoff if they play G: [...] [...] The value of p which makes these two expected values equal is the risk factor for the equilibrium (H,H), with [...] the risk factor for playing (G,G). [...] You can also calculate the risk factor for playing (G,G) by doing the same calculation, <b>but</b> <b>setting</b> p as the probability the other player will play G. [...] An interpretation for p is it is the smallest probability that the opponent must play that strategy such that the person's own payoff from copying the opponent's strategy is greater than if the other strategy was played.|$|E
