5|$|Following its predecessors, <b>Brawl</b> uses {{a battle}} system {{unlike that of}} typical {{fighting}} games. Players can choose from a large selection of characters, each attempting to knock their opponents off the screen as they fight on various stages. The characters in <b>Brawl</b> include most of the same ones as the predecessors, such as the well-known Mario and Pikachu. Instead of using traditional health bars that start at a maximum value and lose value, <b>Brawl</b> characters start the game with 0%; the value rises as they take damage and may rise over 100% {{to a maximum of}} 999%. As a character's percentage increases, the character flies further back when hit. When a character is knocked beyond a stage's boundary and disappears from the screen, the character loses either a life, a point, or coins, depending on the mode of play. <b>Brawl</b> includes a function which allows players to create profiles with personalized button configurations for each control method along with their chosen username.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} infamous {{incidents}} in tournament history occurred in 1987 in Piestany, Czechoslovakia, where a massive <b>brawl</b> involving all players on both teams occurred between Canada and the Soviet Union. It began when Pavel Kostichkin took a two-handed slash at Theoren Fleury and the Soviet Union's Evgeny Davydov came off the bench, eventually leading {{to most of the}} players from both teams joining the <b>brawl.</b> The officials, unable to break up the fight, walked off the ice and eventually tried shutting off the arena lights, but the <b>brawl</b> lasted for 20 minutes before the game was declared null and void. An emergency IIHF meeting resulted in the delegates voting 7–1 to disqualify both teams from the tournament. While the Soviets were out of medal contention, Canada was playing for the gold medal, and were leading 4–2 {{at the time of the}} <b>brawl.</b> The gold medal ultimately went to Finland, hosts Czechoslovakia took the silver and Sweden, who had been eliminated from medal contention, was awarded the bronze. The IIHF voted to suspend all players involved from competing in international events for 18 months, and all coaches for three years. Player suspensions were later cut to six months, which allowed eligible players such as Fleury to participate in the 1988 tournament. The <b>brawl</b> helped raise the profile of the tournament in Canada, where the tournament now ranks as one {{of the most}} important hockey events.|$|E

50|$|Fighting in {{ice hockey}} by enforcers is an established, if unofficial, {{part of the}} sport (especially in North America, where the penalty rules are more permissive); the general {{procedure}} in a one-on-one fight is to let it pan out and then send both players to the penalty box with five-minute major penalties. Escalations beyond isolated fights, such as line <b>brawls</b> between groups of players on the ice, are prohibited, meaning bench-clearing <b>brawls</b> will result in serious consequences. General <b>brawls</b> can result in players being assessed game misconduct penalties and ejected from the game.
