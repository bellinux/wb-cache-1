50|$|Rhizo{{bacteria}} are root-colonizing {{bacteria that}} form symbiotic relationships with many plants. The {{name comes from}} the Greek rhiza, meaning root. Though parasitic varieties of rhizobacteria exist, the term usually refers to bacteria that form a relationship beneficial for both parties (mutualism). They are an important group of microorganisms used in biofertilizer. <b>Biofertilization</b> accounts for about 65% of the nitrogen supply to crops worldwide. Rhizobacteria are {{often referred to as}} plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria, or PGPRs. The term PGPRs was first used by Joseph W. Kloepper in the late 1970s and has become commonly used in scientific literature. PGPRs have different relationships with different species of host plants. The two major classes of relationships are rhizospheric and endophytic. Rhizospheric relationships consist of the PGPRs that colonize the surface of the root, or superficial intercellular spaces of the host plant, often forming root nodules. The dominant species found in the rhizosphere is a microbe from the genus Azospirillum. Endophytic relationships involve the PGPRs residing and growing within the host plant in the apoplastic space.|$|E

The highest N and P contents in wheat grains were found in plants treated by <b>biofertilization</b> with 75 % N and 50 % P of recommended rates under weed-free by bifenox herbicide application. The data showed {{a positive relationship between}} the weed weights and the rates of N and P elements. On the other hand, <b>biofertilization</b> had no effect on weed weights under different treatments. The application of <b>biofertilization</b> increased grain yield by 6. 49 % over the non-biofertilized treatments. Generally, no significant differences were observed in grain yield between nitrogen & phosphorus of recommended rates and with either 100 % N + 50 % P or 75 % N + 100 % P under <b>biofertilization</b> with isoproturon herbicide application...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{microorganisms}} for engineering applications, in particular from {{a context of}} tropical biosystems engineering, has been useful to quantify important variables that are needed to understand the dynamics of edaphic systems in these areas. The current study is framed within those efforts and {{has been designed to}} document the potential of mountain microorganisms for soil <b>biofertilization</b> activities by using a standard experiment with two short-cycle plants. For that, an experiment including three <b>biofertilization</b> irrigation treatments, associated with three retention times in a bioreactor, were selected and compared with a control that was irrigated only with water. After harvesting, a series of biological, chemical, structural, and agronomic tests were conducted on both the soil and the cultivated plants to determine potential differences in the effect of the experimental treatments. Results indicated that a bioreactor retention time, close to two weeks, was the best treatment in terms of positive and significant impact on the biological activity, soil chemical properties, and quality of crops. Such significant differences seem to be related with a more active soil biosystem for the associated treatment. This demonstrates that <b>biofertilization</b> with mountain microorganisms works; but it also suggests that a series of engineering parameters should be studied to optimize such low cost and sustainable fertilization method...|$|E
40|$|A {{field trial}} was {{conducted}} during 2000 and 2001 growing seasons {{at the green}} house of Botany Department, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University to study the effect of <b>biofertilization</b> with different doses of two biofertilizers (biogien and microbien) on the vegetative growth, yield and its components as well as, seed oil content and quality, nitrogen components, total protein and protein profiles and DNA banding patterns in sunflower (Helianthus annus L. cv. Vedock) plant yield. Application of both biofertilizers either alone or in combined treatment leads to considerable improvement in sunflower yield characters as compared with their respective control. However, response differed according {{to the type of}} biofertilizers. The results revealed that <b>biofertilization</b> perform significant improvement in plant productivity and quality. The highest stimulatory effect and the maximum enhancement were exerted in plants treated with biogien at the recommended dose (5 %). It seems reasonable to conclude that <b>biofertilization</b> significantly increased seed yield, nutrient contents of seeds, nitrogen and all nitrogenous compounds, mineral and seed oil contents. However, both biofertilizers decreased the main saturated fatty acids; palmitic and stearic, while increased the main unsaturated fatty acids (oleic, linoleic and linolinic). Thus the yield oil becomes more safer for human consumption. It is of interest to mention here that, The application of biofertilizers induced over or low gene expression of most mid and high molecular weight protein bands. They also induced two new proteins of low molecular weight (2. 1 kDa for biogien and 14. 9 kDa for microbien). These low molecular weights proteins may be used as an adaptive mechanism for biofertilizer application in plants to give the maximum yield. These results are supported by the finding that, <b>biofertilization</b> showed little changes in DNA banding patterns. These changes are either monomorphic quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative changes were recorded clearly using primer OPI- 01, while quantitative changes with disappeared and many faint bands were obtained using primers OPI- 02, - 03, - 04 and - 05. Based on combined effect of both biofertilizers, protein and DNA profiles of sunflower showed the lowest degree of variability. In general, it could be concluded that, <b>biofertilization</b> is a good tool to improve the crop yield productivity and quantity, reduce the rate of chemical fertilizers and the cost of crop production and allow for better environment...|$|E

Our results confirmed those obtained in cereals and alimentary oil producing plants extending the number of non-legumes susceptible to be biofertilized with rhizobia to those whose fruits are raw consumed.

An experiment was conducted to investigate the response of Williams banana plants to biofertilizer in the presence of reduced doses of chemical fertilizers i. e. (25, 50 and 75 % NPK) on growth, yield components and fruit quality. The standard treatment (100 % NPK) revealed an increase in the length and diameter of pseudostem, number of green leaves per plant and leaf area. The treatments received 25 or 50 % NPK plus biofertilizers produced slight increases in the studied vegetative growth parameters. However, the treatment of fertilization with 75 % NPK combined with biofertilizer was the most superior one. Application of 75 % NPK plus biofertilizer caused significant increases in macronutrients contents in leaves compared with either 25 or 50 % NPK with <b>biofertilization</b> or the recommend dose of NPK alone. Biofertilized Williams banana plants were increased the length and weight of bunch, number of fingers/bunch and number of hands/bunch.

30|$|As for {{the effect}} of sludge compost on the {{nutrient}} content of wheat grain, {{this study showed that}} either sludge or compost increased the nutrient content of grain. Such effect resulted from the higher nutrient content of most elements of sludge and compost and their ability to improve the availability of nutrients (Vacai Rocio et al. 2011). The dual application of sludge or compost with either azotobacter or yeast increased most nutrient uptake of wheat grains. Such effect resulted from the ability of biofertilizer to increase protein, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, ferric, and zinc (Alaleh Mottaghian et al. 2008 and Khattab et al. 2015). These results were in agreement with the finding of Zaghloul et al.

To test this hypothesis, a series of microcosm experiments was carried out using two contrasting soils maintained under well-defined physical conditions where transport by mass water flow could not occur. Seed-applied Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW 25 was capable of rhizosphere colonization at matric potentials of − 10 and − 40 kPa in soil without nematodes, but colonization levels were substantially increased by the presence of nematodes.

Scientific researchers involve multidisciplinary approaches to understand adaptation of PGPR, effects on plant physiology and growth induced systemic resistance, biocontrol of plant pathogens and <b>biofertilization.</b> The primary mechanism of biocontrol by PGPR involves the production of antibiotics such as carboxylic acid, 2, 4 -diacetyl phloroglucinoloomycin,pyoluteorin,pyrrolnitrin,kanosamine,zwittemycin-A and pantocin. A cascade of endogenous signals such as sensor kinases, N-acyl homoserine lactones and sigma factors regulates the synthesis of antibiotics. Some of these antibiotics have broad spectrum against many plant pathogens like fungi, viruses and bacteria, affecting crop plants. These antibiotics also serve as determinants in triggering induced systemic resistance (ISR) in the plant system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Free-living plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) {{can be used}} in {{a variety}} of ways when plant growth {{enhancements}} are required. The effects of the PGPR Azospirillum brasilense Sp 245 have been assessed on micropropagation of three fruit tree rootstocks: Mr. S 2 / 5 (plum), GF 677 (peach x almond hybrid) and MM 106 (apple). Sp 245 is a motile, free-living, gram-negative bacterium that occurs in the soil, capable of nitrogen fixation and phytohormones production. Tests with Mr. S 2 / 5 revealed that inoculated plantlets rooted in advance obtaining also a higher rooting percentage compared to the control. Positive results due to the presence of Sp 245 have also been achieved during the acclimatation phase of Mr. S 2 / 5, GF 677 and MM 106 micropropagated plants. Interestingly, A. brasilense Sp 245 revealed a biocontrol activity against Rhizoctonia solani and Phytophthora nicotianae detected in vivo and through in vitro inhibition tests. The biocontrol activity was confirmed by DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) profiles of microbial communities in the rhizosphere. Results acquired suggest that A. brasilense Sp 245 can be convenientely used in substitution of chemicals during rooting and acclimatation phase of micropropagated plants. Finally, a bacterial formulation and a method for <b>biofertilization</b> and bioprotection of vegetal material with Sp 245 have been developed...|$|E

In this study we tested the agronomic relevance of field-inoculated locally sourced and foreign inocula on chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), {{one of the most}} important worldwide grain legumes. The foreign AMF Funneliformis mosseae and Rhizophagus irregularis were used as single and dual species inocula. Crop growth and productivity, plant nutrient uptakes and protein, Fe and Zn grain biofortification were assessed under a rainfed low-input cropping system after autumn and spring sowings. Uni- and multivariate analyses of data showed that AM fungal field inoculation increased chickpea AM fungal root colonization as well as plant biomass and yield. In addition, AMF were also effective in improving the nutritional value of grain by protein, Fe and Zn biofortification. The locally sourced AM fungal inoculum was more efficient then the foreign ones in Fe and Zn grain biofortification and, in the spring sowing treatment, also in improving yield and grain protein content.

40|$|Introduction Utilizing {{biological}} fertilizer is a proper and cheap method for crop production. Potentially, soybean {{can be used}} as {{biological fertilizer}}s and seed inoculation. Zinc is an essential element that have positive effects on plant growth and its development. Canola, sunflower, soybean and safflower are the main cultivated oilseeds in Iran. Soybean production in Iran is very low as compared to other countries. One of the most effective factor in increasing the soybean yield is seed inoculation with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and application of Zinc fertilizer. Some of the benefits provided by PGPR are the ability to produce gibberellic acid, cytokinins and ethylene, N 2 fixation, solubilization of mineral phosphates and other nutrients (56). Numerous studies have shown a substantial increase in dry matter accumulation and seed yield following inoculation with PGPR. Seyed Sharifi (45) reported that seed inoculation with Azotobacter chroococcum strain 5 increased all of the growth indices such as total dry matter, crop growth rate and relative growth rate. Increasing and extending the role of biofertilizers such as Rhizobium can reduce the need for chemical fertilizers and decrease adverse environmental effects. Therefore, in {{the development and implementation of}} sustainable agricultural techniques, <b>biofertilization</b> has great importance in alleviating environmental pollution and deterioration of the nature.

This study genetically characterizes bacteria isolated from bean root nodules in Cuba and investigates {{the effect of}} RhizobiumePseudomonas co-inoculation on common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) genotypes under two different Cuban soil conditions. Bacteria were identified by partial sequencing of the 16 S rDNA gene. Growth-promoting effects of Rhizobium pisiePseudomonas monteilii co-inoculation were evaluated under field conditions in consecutive years. Two contrasting bean genotypes (BAT- 477 and DOR- 364) were co-inoculated and grown in two different soil types (Cambisol and Oxisol) in Cuban farm areas. Several growth parameters were evaluated at three time points during the crop cycle (21, 42 and 87 days after planting). In total, 20 strains were isolated belonging to six different genera, i. e. Arthrobacter, Chryseobacterium, Enterobacter, trophomonas, Pseudomonas and Rhizobium. It was observed that native RhizobiumePseudomonas co-inoculation as compared to single Rhizobium inoculation increased the nodulation, growth parameters and yield of the different genotypes. The response of BAT- 477 was more pronounced than that of DOR- 364. These findings contribute {{to the understanding of}} the interplay between Rhizobium, PGPR and the plant host under different soil conditions.

Bags {{were treated with}} microorganisms using three methods of inoculation i. e. soil inoculation (single or mixed cultures); leaf inoculation (single culture), and soil and leaf inoculation (mixed inoculation). Plants were harvested after 3 months of cultivation. Shoot and root lengths, shoot and root dry weights, leaves fresh and dry weights, vitamin C g/g fresh leaf, protein g/g leaves dry weight and mineral contents (Mg, P, K, Zn, Mn, Fe and Cu) were recorded. <b>Biofertilization</b> by different inoculation methods increased most of the parameters tested. The highest records of shoot and root lengths, and shoot and root dry weights were obtained with soil inoculation with mixed cultures of (Azotobacter chroococcum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and (Azot. chroococcum and Bacillus circulans). The same trend in respect of Vitamin C was obtained. But, the highest protein contents (g/g dry weight leaves) were obtained with soil inoculation with (Azot. chroococcum and B. circulans), (Bacillus megatherium) and (Azot. chroococcum and S. cerevisiae), which gave 0. 73, 0. 59 and 0. 58 gprotein/g leaves dry weight respectively.

The treatments consisted of biofertilizers alone or combination treatment viz., control (without any microbial inoculation), Azotobacter, Azospirillum, Phosphobacteria, Rhizobium, Rhizobium + Azotobacter, Rhizobium + Azospirillum and Rhizobium + Phosphobacteria replicated three times in randomized block design. The results revealed that <b>biofertilization</b> perform significant improvement in plant productivity and quality. The maximum germination percentage, fresh and dry weight, no. of pods per plant, seed yield per plant, hundred seed weight and root nodules per plant were increased with the inoculation of biofertilizers especially Rhizobium with Phosphobacteria treatment when compared to others. Generally, biofertilizers induced over or low gene expression of most mid and high molecular weight protein bands. Hither, they also induced new proteins of low molecular weight.

40|$|Bananas and plantains are {{of special}} {{significance}} to human society and are ranked as fourth most important {{food in the}} world after rice, wheat, and maize. Increased trade in local, regional and international markets has also made them an important cash crop, {{and in some cases}} the only source of income for rural populations. In Kenya, production of bananas is constrained by among others declining soil fertility coupled with high cost of fertilizers. A sustainable complementary response to declining soil fertility would be to increase the biological inputs of nutrients by exploitation of microorganisms, which are largely untapped natural resources for plant growth promotion. Endophytic bacteria are known to enhance plant growth in non-leguminous crops and improve their nutrition through nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilisation or siderophore production (iron chelation). Besides <b>biofertilization,</b> endophytic bacteria are also reported to promote plant growth and yield through direct production of phytohormones, or enzymes, or indirectly through biological control of plant pests and diseases or induced resistance response (biotization). In return, the plant protects endophytes and provides them with nutrients in form of photosynthates. Endophytes are increasingly gaining scientific and commercial interest because of this potential to improve plant quality and growth and their close association with internal tissues of host plant. This paper reviews the potential use of endophytic bacteria as biofertilizers for sustainable banana production.
