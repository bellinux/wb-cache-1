[...] On inking Kirby, Williamson relates: [...] "I {{remember}} {{going up to}} Harvey and getting work there. They said, 'We haven't got any work for you, but we have some stories here that Jack penciled. Do you want to ink them?' I'd never really inked anybody else before, but I said, 'Sure,' because I looked at the stuff, and thought, I can follow this, it's all there. I inked it and they liked it, and they gave me three or four stories to do." ...|$|E

500|$|Stengel {{has been}} praised {{for his role}} in {{successfully}} launching the Mets. Appel deemed the Mets' beginnings unique, as later expansion teams have been given better players to begin with, [...] "few expansion teams in any sport have tried the formula—a quotable, fan-popular man who would charm the press and deflect attention away from ineptness on the field." [...] Arthur Daley of The New York Times wrote, [...] "he gave the Mets the momentum they needed when they needed it most. He was the booster that got them off the ground and on their journey. The smoke screen he generated to accompany the <b>blast-off</b> obscured the flaws and gave the Mets an acceptance and a following they could not have obtained without him." [...] James wrote, [...] "Stengel became such a giant character that you really can't talk about him in the past. He became an enduring part of the game." [...] Commissioner William Eckert said of Stengel, [...] "he's probably done more for baseball than anyone." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band's music {{continued}} {{to become more}} complex and symphonic, with heavy amounts of reverberation on the vocal tracks, resulting in 1969's To Our Children's Children's Children— a concept album inspired by the first moon landing. The opening track [...] "Higher and Higher" [...] saw Pinder simulate a rocket <b>blast-off</b> on keyboards, then narrate Edge's lyrics. Thomas' [...] "Floating" [...] and [...] "Eternity Road" [...] stood out, as did Hayward's [...] "Gypsy" [...] and a rare Pinder-Lodge collaboration [...] "Out and In". Lodge provided his two-part [...] "Eyes of a Child" [...] and [...] "Candle of Life" [...] while Pinder contributed [...] "Sun is Still Shining". The album closed with [...] "Watching and Waiting", composed by Ray Thomas and Justin Hayward and sung by Hayward. It was during 1969 that the band established their own label [...] "Threshold" [...] under licence to Decca Records. To Our Children's Children's Children {{was the first of}} their albums to be released on their own label. The song [...] "Watching and Waiting" [...] was issued as a single on the Threshold label, but failed to chart.|$|E

50|$|The line {{started off}} with one-shots Unearthly Spectaculars #1, Thrill-O-Rama #1, <b>Blast-Off</b> #1, and Warfront #36 in October 1965, using work that was {{apparently}} done for the 1950s Thrill Adventure line.

50|$|In the United States, {{the film}} was first {{released}} by American International Pictures in Los Angeles on 26 July 1967 as Those Fantastic Flying Fools, in order to capitalise {{on the success of}} Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965), which also starred Terry-Thomas and Gert Fröbe, and where the director Don Sharp was responsible for the aerial sequences. However, it wasn't the hit that the distributors expected, so it was cut down to 95 minutes and released as <b>Blast-Off</b> elsewhere in the US - but that version was no success either.|$|E
50|$|The {{show was}} based on the {{exploits}} of clean-cut, square-jawed Rocky Jones, the best known of the Space Rangers. These were Earth-based space policemen who patrolled the United Worlds of the Solar System in the not-too-distant future. Rocky and his crew would routinely <b>blast-off</b> in a V-2-like chemically-fueled, upright rocketship, the Orbit Jet XV-2, or later the nearly identical Silver Moon XV-3, on missions to moons and planetoids where the odds of success seemed remote yet they would always prevail. Although they might destroy a rocketship full of unseen bad guys, their space pistols were never fired at people, and conflicts were always resolved with fistfights.|$|E
