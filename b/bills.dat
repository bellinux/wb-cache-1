5|$|The CCE's two <b>bills</b> were {{submitted}} to Parliament {{at the same}} time as a large number of other <b>bills</b> for underground railways in the capital. As it had done in 1892, Parliament established a joint committee under Lord Windsor to review the <b>bills.</b> By the time the committee had produced its report, the parliamentary session was almost over and the promoters of the <b>bills</b> were asked to resubmit them for the following 1902 session. <b>Bills</b> No. 1 and No. 2 were resubmitted in November 1901 together with a new bill – bill No. 3. The new bill modified the route of the proposed extension to Golders Green and added a short extension running beneath Charing Cross main line station to the Victoria Embankment where it would provide an interchange with the existing MDR station (then called Charing Cross).|$|E
5|$|The Patriots and the <b>Bills</b> {{were both}} charter {{members of the}} AFL, and even competed {{with each other in}} an AFL playoff game. They have {{remained}} divisional rivals since the NFL-AFL merger. Prior to the rise of Tom Brady, the two teams shared a mellow, yet occasionally competitive rivalry, featuring highlights from players such as O.J. Simpson, Steve Grogan, Joe Ferguson, Jim Kelly, and Drew Bledsoe. However, Brady has dominated the <b>Bills</b> ever since taking over as the Patriots' franchise quarterback, holding a 26-3 regular season record over them. Though Patriots fans usually feel apathetic towards the <b>Bills,</b> <b>Bills</b> fans have come to despise the Patriots more than any other rival. The rivalry has remained somewhat intense in recent years with multiple players having played for both teams, the <b>Bills</b> usually giving their all when playing the Patriots, and the presence of Rex Ryan, who coached both the <b>Bills</b> and Jets and was known for his trash-talk.|$|E

In terms of tenure, Marv Levy has coached more games (182) and seasons (12) than any other coach in franchise history. He coached the <b>Bills</b> to four straight AFC Championships from 1990–1993, but failed to lead the team to a victory in the Super Bowl. One of Levy's predecessors, Lou Saban, who coached the team on two separate occasions, led the team to the victories in the AFL championship in 1964 and 1965. Three <b>Bills</b> coaches—Saban, Levy and Chuck Knox—have been named coach of the year by at least one major news organization. Levy and Jim Ringo are the only <b>Bills</b> coaches to have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E

50|$|When the <b>bill</b> of lading {{is used as}} a {{document}} of title, it is particularly related to the case of buyer. When the buyer is entitled to received goods from the carrier, <b>bill</b> of lading in this case performs as document of title for the goods. There are two types of <b>bill</b> of lading that can perform as document of title. They are straight <b>bill</b> of lading and order <b>bill</b> of lading. Straight <b>bill</b> of lading is a <b>bill</b> of lading issued to a named consignee that is not negotiable. In this case, the <b>bill</b> of lading should be directed only to one specific consignee indicated on the <b>bill</b> of lading. Order <b>bill</b> of lading is the opposite from a straight <b>bill</b> of lading and there is no specific or named consignee. Therefore, an order <b>bill</b> of lading can be negotiated to a third party.|$|R

5|$|Before {{the reign}} of Henry VIII, the {{sovereign}} always granted his or her assent in person. The sovereign, wearing the Imperial State Crown, would be seated on the throne in the Lords chamber, surrounded by heralds {{and members of the}} royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The Commons, led by their speaker, would listen from the Bar of the Lords, just outside the chamber. The Clerk of the Parliaments presented the <b>bills</b> awaiting assent to the monarch, save that supply <b>bills</b> were traditionally brought up by the speaker. The Clerk of the Crown, standing on the sovereign's right, then read aloud the titles of the <b>bills</b> (in earlier times, the entire text of the <b>bills).</b> The Clerk of the Parliaments, standing on the sovereign's left, responded by stating the appropriate Norman French formula.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bills</b> can be {{introduced}} to Parliament {{in a number of}} ways; the Scottish Government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill; a committee of the Parliament can present a bill in one of the areas under its remit; a member of the Scottish Parliament can introduce a bill as a private member; or a private bill can be submitted to Parliament by an outside proposer. Most draft laws are government <b>bills</b> introduced by ministers in the governing party (or parties). <b>Bills</b> pass through Parliament in a number of stages before receiving royal assent, whereupon they become Acts of the Scottish Parliament.|$|E
