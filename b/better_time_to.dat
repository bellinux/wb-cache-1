500|$|From April 2006 onwards, Bethesda began {{releasing}} small, downloadable {{packages of}} content from their website {{and over the}} Xbox Live Marketplace, for prices equivalent to between one and three US dollars. The first package, a set of horse armor for Oblivions steeds, was released on April 3, 2006, costing 200 Marketplace points, equivalent to US$2.50 or £1.50; the corresponding PC release cost was US$1.99. Bethesda offered no rationale for the price discrepancy. These were not the first Oblivion-related Marketplace releases (the first {{was a series of}} dashboard themes and picture packs released prior to Oblivions publication, in February 2006, for a nominal fee) nor were they entirely unexpected: Bethesda had previously announced their desire to support the Xbox release with downloadable Marketplace content, and other publishers had already begun to release similar packages for their games, at similar prices. A November 2005-release of a [...] "Winter Warrior Pack" [...] for [...] was also priced at 200 Marketplace points, and similar content additions had been scheduled for Project Gotham Racing 3 and Perfect Dark Zero.

50|$|Use of {{a fighter}} brand {{is one of}} the oldest {{strategies}} in branding, tracing its history to cigarette marketing in the 19th century. The strategy is most often used in difficult economic times. As customers trade down to lower-priced offers because of economic constraints, many managers at mid-tier and premium brands are faced with a classic strategic conundrum: Should they tackle the threat head-on and reduce existing prices, knowing it will reduce profits and potentially commodify the brand? Or should they maintain prices, hope for <b>better</b> <b>times</b> <b>to</b> return, and in the meantime lose customers who might never come back? With both alternatives often equally unpalatable, many companies choose the third option of launching a fighter brand.|$|R

30|$|When {{long-term}} poverty hit {{the roof}} in 1997 (poverty episodes covering 1993 - 2001), it was instead exceptionally reliant on people with some {{connection to the}} labour market, whether in terms of looking for employment or having some employment income (though not enough of it to avoid poverty). This was a group, however, whose poverty often would be eliminated by the <b>better</b> <b>times</b> <b>to</b> come, and the decrease in long-term poverty resulted both from decreases in in-work poverty and from lower unemployment.

It was, as I have said, mere chance which had brought so many persons of a particular type together on this occasion, and I thought I might go there year after year and never see the like again. As a fact I did return when August came round and found a crowd of a different character. The type was there but did not predominate: {{it was no longer}} the herd of beautiful white and strawberry cows with golden horns and large placid eyes.

60|$|In the {{interval}} of my seclusion, {{there had been}} a number of recruits to our little army of saints and martyrs. They were mostly individuals who had gone through such an experience as to disgust them with ordinary pursuits, but who were not yet so old, nor had suffered so deeply, as to lose their faith in the <b>better</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> come. On comparing their minds one with another they often discovered that this idea of a Community had been growing up, in silent and unknown sympathy, for years. Thoughtful, strongly lined faces were among them; sombre brows, but eyes that did not require spectacles, unless prematurely dimmed by the student's lamplight, and hair that seldom showed a thread of silver. Age, wedded to the past, incrusted over with a stony layer of habits, and retaining nothing fluid in its possibilities, would have been absurdly out of place in an enterprise like this. Youth, too, in its early dawn, was hardly more adapted to our purpose; for it would behold the morning radiance of its own spirit beaming over the very same spots of withered grass and barren sand whence most of us had seen it vanish. We had very young people with us, it is true,--downy lads, rosy girls in their first teens, and children of all heights above one's knee; but these had chiefly been sent hither for education, which {{it was one of the}} objects and methods of our institution to supply. Then we had boarders, from town and elsewhere, who lived with us in a familiar way, sympathized more or less in our theories, and sometimes shared in our labors.|$|E

6000|$|Adding Andrew's {{information}} to what I had myself observed, I could scarce doubt that some attack was meditated upon our party. The road, as we advanced, seemed to afford every facility {{for such an}} unpleasant interruption. At first it winded apart from the lake through marshy meadow ground, overgrown with copsewood, now traversing dark and close thickets which would have admitted an ambuscade to be sheltered within a few yards of our line of march, and frequently crossing rough mountain torrents, some of which took the soldiers up to the knees, and ran with such violence, that their force could only be stemmed by the strength {{of two or three}} men holding fast by each other's arms. It certainly appeared to me, though altogether unacquainted with military affairs, that a sort of half-savage warriors, as I had heard the Highlanders asserted to be, might, in such passes as these, attack a party of regular forces with great advantage. The Bailie's good sense and shrewd observation had led him to the same conclusion, as I understood from his requesting to speak with the captain, whom he addressed nearly in the following terms:-- [...] "Captain, it's no to fleech ony favour out o' ye, for I scorn it--and it's under protest that I reserve my action and pleas of oppression and wrongous imprisonment;--but, being a friend to King George and his army, I take the liberty to speer--Dinna ye think ye might tak a <b>better</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> gang up this glen?
