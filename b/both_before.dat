5|$|The 1953 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the first}} time an organized list of female names was used to name Atlantic storms. It officially began on June15, and lasted until November15, although activity occurred <b>both</b> <b>before</b> and after the season's limits. The season was active with fourteentotal storms, six of which developed into hurricanes; four of the hurricanes attained major hurricane status, or a Category3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson scale.|$|E

Starting on March 6, 2000, Final Fantasy IX characters {{were used in}} a line of computer-generated Coca-Cola commercials. Figurines of several characters were also used as prizes in Coca-Cola's marketing campaign. That same year, IGN awarded Final Fantasy dolls and figurines for prizes in several of their contests.|$|E

5|$|Walker {{suggests}} that the TMI accident incited widespread criticism of nuclear power technology, the nuclear industry, and the NRC. Critics faulted the industry and the NRC for their poor performance <b>both</b> <b>before</b> and after the accident. The international attention garnered by the crisis redoubled the determination of, and enhanced the credibility of, the anti-nuclear movement. Arguably, the United States nuclear industry has never recovered.|$|E

5|$|A {{very fast}} Schumacher {{took the lead}} on track on lap 12 when Berger ran wide, before relinquishing the race lead overall to Berger {{when he made his}} first pitstop, {{confirming}} that his pace <b>both</b> <b>before</b> and after the red flag was down to him running a three-stop strategy, therefore racing with a lighter car. Berger pitted at the end of lap 15 for his first of two scheduled stops, before retiring a lap later with handling problems. Häkkinen led his first ever laps of a Formula One World Championship race, before pitting at the end of lap 18. Following the first series of pit stops, Schumacher resumed the race lead.|$|E
5|$|<b>Both</b> <b>before</b> the {{establishment}} of Australia Day as the national day of Australia, and {{in the years after}} its creation, several dates have been proposed for its celebration and, at various times, the possibility of moving Australia Day to an alternative date has been mooted. Some reasons put forward are that the current date, celebrating the foundation of the Colony of New South Wales, lacks national significance; that the day falls on school holidays which limits the engagement of schoolchildren in the event; and that it fails to encompass members of the indigenous community and some others who perceive the day as commemorating the date of an invasion of their land. Connected to this is the suggestion that moving the date would be seen as a significant symbolic act.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{nominated}} 41 lower {{federal court}} judges {{in addition to}} his four Supreme Court justices. These included two judges to the United States circuit courts, nine judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 30 judges to the United States district courts. Because Cleveland served terms <b>both</b> <b>before</b> and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts of Appeals, he is one of only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies. The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office {{at the time that the}} change was made. Thus, all of Cleveland's appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term, and all of his appointments to the Courts of Appeals were made in his second.|$|E

5|$|Congestion pricing remains highly {{controversial}} {{with the public}} <b>both</b> <b>before</b> and after implementation. This has in part been resolved through referendums, such as after the seven-month trial period in Stockholm; however this creates a debate as to where the border line for the referendum should go, since it is often the people living outside the urban area who {{have to pay the}} tax, while the external benefit is granted those who live within the area. In Stockholm there was a majority in the referendum within the city border (where the votes counted), but not outside.|$|E
5|$|Empress Shulü Ping, {{who became}} known as Empress Dowager Yingtian {{following}} the death of her husband, was an exceptionally powerful figure <b>both</b> <b>before</b> and after Taizu's death. While the latter was alive, Shulü Ping commanded an army of 200,000 horsemen that was tasked with maintaining order while Taizu led military campaigns abroad. She also led campaigns herself. Following the death of her husband, the Empress rejected the traditional Khitan custom of being buried with him, and elected to cut off her right hand and bury that with the Emperor instead. Shulü Ping then seized full military and civil authority in order to oversee the imperial succession under her own terms. The Empress's refusal to kill herself and be buried with Taizu effectively ended the longstanding custom.|$|E
5|$|Fuller painted {{other works}} for the Hacketts. In a 1937 piece {{reflecting}} on early twentieth-century art in Western Australia, a reviewer recalled:Dr. (later Sir Winthrop) Hackett was a great patron of Miss Fuller, {{and he was a}} constant visitor to her dignified studio, above his office in the old West Australian Chambers. The first portrait I saw Miss Fuller working on was of Mrs. E. Chase... The portrait was a commission from Dr. Hackett, and was destined to hang in his gallery. Miss Fuller painted Lady Hackett <b>both</b> <b>before</b> and after her marriage, and one particularly happy picture of her is as a young girl gathering wildflowers in the Darlington hills. Her portraits of the first Hackett babies were charming studies of childhood.|$|E

Additional charges were assessed as follows: Every province receiving power from the Three Gorges Dam had to pay ¥7.00 per MWh extra. Other provinces had to pay an additional charge of ¥4.00 per MWh. The Tibet Autonomous Region pays no surcharge.|$|E
5|$|He was Director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, {{which he}} helped to found with Ernest O. Lawrence, from 1958 to 1960, and after that he {{continued}} as an Associate Director. He chaired the committee that founded the Space Sciences Laboratory at Berkeley. He also served concurrently as a Professor of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley. He was a tireless advocate of a strong nuclear program and argued for continued testing and development—in fact, he {{stepped down from the}} directorship of Livermore so that he could better lobby against the proposed test ban. He testified against the test ban <b>both</b> <b>before</b> Congress as well as on television.|$|E

Rick eventually convinces Hershel to return, but as they are about to leave, two men from Philadelphia enter the bar—Dave (Michael Raymond-James) and Tony (Aaron Munoz). They reveal that Rick's goal of Fort Benning may be overridden and try to goad where the group's farm is, looking for safe haven. Rick refuses to disclose the farm's location, and shoots them <b>both</b> <b>before</b> they fire back on him.|$|E
