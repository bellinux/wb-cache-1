30|$|An {{important}} {{aim of the}} European Community Regulation on {{chemicals and}} their safe use is the identification of (very) persistent, (very) bioaccumulative, and toxic substances. In other regulatory chemical safety assessments (pharmaceuticals, biocides, pesticides), the identification of such (very) persistent, (very) bioaccumulative, and toxic substances is of increasing importance. Solid-phase microextraction is especially capable of extracting total water concentrations {{as well as the}} freely dissolved fraction of analytes in the water phase, which is available for <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>in</b> <b>fish.</b> However, although already well established in environmental analyses to determine and quantify analytes mainly in aqueous matrices, solid-phase microextraction is still a rather unusual method in regulatory ecotoxicological research.

For highly hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs; octanol–water partition coefficient [log KOW][*]>[*] 5), testing via aqueous exposure may become increasingly difficult. A solid-phase desorption dosing system was developed to generate stable concentrations of HOCs without using solubilizing agents. The system was tested with hexachlorobenzene (HCB), o-terphenyl (oTP), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 153, and dibenz[a,h]anthracene (DBA) (log[*]KOW 5. 5 – 7. 8) in 2 flow-through fish tests with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The analysis of the test media applied during the bioconcentration factor (BCF) studies showed that stable analyte concentrations of the 4 HOCs were maintained in the test system over an uptake period of 8 wk. Bioconcentration factors (L[*]kg− 1 wet wt) were estimated for HCB (BCF 35 [*] 589), oTP (BCF 12 [*] 040), and PCB 153 (BCF 18 [*] 539) based on total water concentrations. No bioconcentration could be determined for DBA, probably because of the rapid metabolism of the test item. The solid-phase desorption dosing system is suitable to provide stable aqueous concentrations of HOCs required to determine the <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> and represents {{a viable alternative to}} the use of solubilizing agents for the preparation of test solutions.

Thus, these compounds, their metabolites and TPs formed during human/animals/bacteria metabolism, wastewater treatment and natural environmental processes are tend to contaminate all the environmental compartments. Appearance of advanced analytical instrumentation and techniques enable to perform research on emerging environment contaminants fate. This thesis was focused on application of high resolution mass spectrometer and new generation of triple quadrupole for analysis of the environmental pollutants. All studies were mainly devoted to such a group of contaminants as pharmaceuticals because of their high consumption, frequent occurrence in all environmental matrices and potential to cause adverse effects for non-targeted organism due to their biological activity. The {{first part of the}} thesis is related to method development for identification and quantification of metabolites in the different tissues of rainbow trout exposed to diltiazem. As a result, 17 diltiazem metabolites were tentatively identified by HRMS and spectral interpretation software. The complex metabolic pathway in metabolic phase I for diltiazem and tissue specific <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> were proposed in the study. The second part of the work is mainly focused on investigation of pharmaceuticals fate in the soil environment. The transformation of several pharmaceuticals, such as atenolol, metoprolol, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and clindamycin in 13 different soils was studied under laboratory conditions. The parent compounds were analyzed in all studied soils and dissipation curves were plotted. Finally, 15 known and new metabolites were detected and identified. Moreover, identity of 6 of them was confirmed by available analytical standards. It was shown that almost the same metabolites profile was observed in all soils, but formed amount and degradation rate of all detected metabolites were soil type dependent. Several parent compounds and metabolites were shown to be persistent in the soils. Consequently, pharmaceuticals can be transported via ground water to plant. Further fate of pharmaceuticals must be studied as it can have adverse effect on crop consumers. The third part of the dissertation dealt with an important issue of pharmaceuticals transport between different aquatic environmental compartments. Water, sediments and fish from a pond affected with TWW from a local WWTP were analyzed within this project. 18 pharmaceuticals and 7 their metabolites were found in all studied matrices. Solid water distribution coefficients for sediments and bioaccumulation factors for fish liver were obtained in this study under real conditions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{relative}} lethal and sublethal {{toxicity of}} cassava wastewater effluents {{from a local}} food factory were investigated on Clarias gariepinus fingerlings using a renewable static bioassay. The physico-chemical characteristics of the cassava wastewater effluents showed a number of deviations from {{the standards of the}} Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) on the guidelines for effluent discharges. Considering the pollutants of the effluent, cyanide (CN) is suspected to be primarily responsible for the toxicity, although synergistic effect of other pollutants cannot be ruled out. At each exposure, in the two tests, the test-organisms showed signs of serious stress, swimming pattern changed and mortality increased over relatively small increase in concentration. The LC 50 for lethal and sublethal tests were 0. 024 mg 1 - 1 and 0. 0064 mg 1 - 1, respectively. The differences observed in the mortalities and <b>bioconcentration</b> of metals <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> muscles of varying concentrations were significant (p< 0. 05).

Due to their widespread occurrence in the various environmental compartments they have been classified by OSPARCOM (Oslo and Paris Commissions) (3) as chemicals for priority action and have been proposed by the Marine Chemistry Working Group (MCWG) as chemical parameters in the Water Framework Directive (4). Based on their octanol-water partitioning coefficients (log K ow = 4. 02 - 4. 49) (5) and <b>bioconcentration</b> factors <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> (ranging from 182 to 3200, depending on the lipid content) (6), these chemicals are expected to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms. Against their potential significance in the marine environment there is relatively little information available concerning the actual concentration levels and distribution of trichlorobenzenes in marine organisms (7, 8). The aim of this work was to develop an analytical method appropriate for the determination of TCBs in marine biota. The analytical method consists of saponification of the fish tissue with methanolic potassium hydroxide, liquid-liquid extraction of the solution with pentane, clean up of the concentrated extract on alumina column {{and analysis of the}} extract with gas chromatograph equipped with electron capture detector (ECD). The method proved to be appropriate for the detection of concentration levels typical of the organic contaminants in biota (7) (~ 1 ng /g wet weight of tissue). The relative standard deviation of the analysis of 1, 3, 5 -, 1, 2, 4 - and 1, 2, 3 -trichlorobenzene was 8, 6 and 18 % (n= 4) respectively.

40|$|The {{presented}} study {{describes a}} standardised method {{for measuring the}} bioaccumulation of sediment-associated chemicals in endobenthic animals. The tubificid oligochaetes Tubifex tubifex and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri represent the benthic infauna. Lindane and Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were chosen as model substances. They were applied in a " 1 " 4 C-radiolabelled form. Uptake, depuration and the resulting bioaccumulation factors (BAF) were determined. The results were compared with the corresponding fish-bioconcentration factors (BCF). " 1 " 4 C-Lindane was accumulated in the tubificids {{by a factor of}} 4. 7 (mean value; n= 4). " 1 " 4 C-HCB reached a BAF of 6. 6 (n= 4) in both test species. These BAF values are based on wet weight and radioactive concentrations. Lindane was taken up faster than HCB. When transferred to clean sediment the worms eliminated both test substances rapidly and nearly completely. No major metabolites were detected in worms, sediment and water. The applied kinetic model equations fitted to the data using non-linear regression analysis showed a good fit. The determined BAF values of " 1 " 4 C-Lindane and " 1 " 4 C-HCB are orders of magnitude below the corresponding fish-BCF values. Nevertheless, the tubificid body burdens resulting from exposure to contaminated sediment can reach notably higher body burdens than fish body burdens resulting from exposure to the water phase only. The presented data show that the assessment of bioaccumulation based exclusively on the extrapolation of fish-BCF to other organisms and environmental compartments is not appropriate.

Verapamil, diltiazem and atenolol are very important representatives of cardiovascular pharmaceuticals; therefore, the present research focused on their acute and sub-chronic effects, bioconcentration, half-life time and metabolism <b>in</b> <b>fish.</b> Moreover, unified protocol for the quantitative assessment of histopathological alterations on the heart ventricle and coronary blood vessels employing heart index calculation was developed with the aim to better assess histopathological changes <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> heart {{which is one of the}} targets of cardiovascular pharmaceuticals and other chemicals. The effects caused by high concentrations of the studied substances, verapamil, diltiazem and atenolol, <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> can be considered similar to the therapeutic effects and side effects that are found in humans. The acute exposure to verapamil at the human therapeutic plasma level reduced the heart rate in common carp embryos and larvae. In addition, the acute and chronic exposure to this substance caused peripheral edema and gastrointestinal haemorrhage in carp. Similarly, the histological changes in heart and the blood vessels of the liver in diltiazem exposed rainbow trout suggested vasodilatation similar to the pharmacological effect of diltiazem in the human body. In rainbow trout sub-chronically exposed to atenolol at a human therapeutic blood plasma concentration, histopathological changes in the cardiovascular system were found. The bioconcentration of verapamil, diltiazem and atenolol <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> can be classified as low. Bioconcentration factor (BCF) of verapamil in whole body homogenates of common carp ranged between 6. 6 and 16. 6. The BCF of diltiazem was also relatively low (0. 5 - 194) in analysed tissues of trout, following the order kidney liver muscle blood plasma. BCF of atenolol in rainbow trout tissues was the lowest among the tested substances (BCF = 0. 002 - 0. 27), following the order of liver > kidney > muscle. In the blood plasma, the concentration of atenolol was below the limit of quantification. Verapamil showed a longer half-life time (10. 6 days) <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> compared to the human body, indicating the slow rate of biotransformation and/or elimination of verapamil <b>in</b> <b>fish.</b> Estimated half-life times of diltiazem in liver (1. 5 h) and kidney (6. 2 h) were in the same order of magnitudes as those determined for the human blood plasma. The half-life time of atenolol in trout was not studied, because of its very low <b>bioconcentration.</b> <b>In</b> diltiazem exposed rainbow trout, 8 groups of metabolites of diltiazem with 17 different isoforms were identified using liquid chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry method. Diltiazem was found to undergo a biotransformation involving desmethylation, desacethylation and hydroxylation <b>in</b> <b>fish.</b> These results showed that diltiazem was metabolised <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> a similar way like in the human body by desmethylation and desacethylation. On the other hand, hydroxylation, which was involved to a minor extent, seemed to be species specific. Verapamil had no effect on early life stages of common carp at the environmentally relevant concentration after one month lasting exposure. On the other hand, atenolol and diltiazem in environmentally realistic concentrations caused after 42 -day exposure some physiological changes in rainbow trout. Namely, atenolol affected haematological and biochemical parameters of the blood in exposed rainbow trout and diltiazem caused changes in the activity of antioxidant enzymes in trout liver and gills.

These compounds end up in waste waters and enter sewage treatment plants (STPs). But {{not all of these}} compounds are removed during the treatment processes in STP and they enter the aquatic environment via sewage effluents. The thesis is focused especially on evaluation of presence and potential toxicological effects of PPCPs in aquatic environment. The risk assessment for a single compound is usually based on laboratory experiments. The first tested compound was verapamil, a pharmaceutical for lowering blood pressure and treatment of cardiac diseases. Two types of tests were carried out, an acute one with high concentration levels and a sub-chronic one with levels that included environmentally relevant concentration. After the exposure, common carp larvae and embryos showed malformation and edemas and the heart rate was decreased. According to 96 hLC 50, the verapamil could be classified as a harmful or toxic substance. The second tested substance was UV filter 2 phenylbenzimidazole- 5 -sulfonic acid which was found at relatively high concentrations in south Bohemian surface waters. In spite of very low <b>bioconcentration</b> of PBSA <b>in</b> <b>fish,</b> activities of 7 -ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, 7 -methoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and 7 -penthoxyresorufin-O-deethylase in exposed rainbow trout were increased which indicate that activity of cytochromes P 450 were affected even in environmentally relevant concentration. In a real aquatic system, fish are exposed to waters which contain not only a single pollutant but a mixture of them. A consequent experiment was carried out on rainbow trout caged in effluent for 13 days from STP in Gothenburg, the second biggest STP in Sweden. The concentration of selected antidepressants was measured <b>in</b> different <b>fish</b> tissues and plasma. Citalopram, sertraline and venlafaxine were found <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> brain and liver. As these antidepressants are used for the treatment of psychical disorders, behavior of fish could be affected. The limitations of these experiments, even with real water with a mixture of chemicals, are that <b>fish</b> are stressed <b>in</b> aquaria or cages and the exposure via the food chain is not included. Benthic organisms {{are an important part of}} fish diet. The impact of pollution on benthic organisms is often studied. However, there is limited knowledge about the bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals in the benthos and consequently <b>in</b> <b>fish.</b> Therefore bioaccumulation <b>in</b> Hydropsyche and Erpobdella was studied. These organisms were collected in non-polluted and in effluent affected localities. Antibiotics azithromycin and clarithromycin, cardio-vascular drug verapamil, antifungal drug clotrimazole and antidepressants citalopram and sertraline were found in Hydropsyche. Cardio-vascular drug valsartan, antidepressant sertraline, anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac and antifungal drug clotrimazole were found in Erpobdella. Passive sampling is an integrative sampling method which allows the obtaining of time average concentration over period of few weeks. POCIS (Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers) are used for sampling of polar compounds. It also can mimic bioconcentration. Based on the field experiments, the sampling rate for individual pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs was calculated. Twenty-one localities in the Czech Republic were sampled by POCIS and the water concentration of psychoactive drugs was estimated. Further research is necessary to make POCIS passive sampling a more precise tool for monitoring pharmaceutical and drug contents in aquatic environments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Metal uptake and {{accumulation}} <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> parasites largely {{depends on}} the parasite group with acanthocephalans showing the highest accumulation rates. Additionally, developmental stage (larvae or adult) as well as parasite location in the host are suggested to be decisive factors for metal <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>in</b> parasites. By using barbel (Barbus barbus) simultaneously infected with nematode larvae in the body cavity and adult acanthocephalans in the intestine, {{the relative importance of}} all of these factors was compared in the same host. Methods Eleven elements Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Cobalt (Co), Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Lead (Pb), Selenium (Se), Tin (Sn), Vanadium (V) and Zinc (Zn) were analyzed in barbel tissues (muscle, intestine, liver) as well as in their acanthocephalan parasites Pomphorhynchus laevis and the larval nematode Eustrongylides sp. (L 4) using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results Nine elements were detected in significantly higher levels in the parasites compared to host tissues. The element composition among parasites was found to be strongly dependent on parasite taxa/developmental stage and localization within the host. Intestinal acanthocephalans accumulated mainly toxic elements (As, Cd, Pb), whereas the intraperitoneal nematodes bioconcentrated essential elements (Co, Cu, Fe, Se, Zn). Conclusion Our results suggest that in addition to acanthocephalans, nematodes such as Eustrongylides sp. can also be applied as bioindicators for metal pollution. Using both parasite taxa simultaneously levels {{of a wide variety of}} elements (essential and non essential) can easily be obtained. Therefore this host-parasite system can be suggested as an appropriate tool for future metal monitoring studies, if double infected fish hosts are available. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{pharmaceutical}} compounds (PC) are {{ubiquitous in}} aquatic ecosystems. In addition to direct ecotoxicity, the <b>bioconcentration</b> of PC <b>in</b> organisms {{is a phenomenon}} which could {{have an impact on}} the whole ecosystem. In order to study this phenomenon, we exposed unicellular algae (Pseudokirchneri- ella subcapitata) to 15 N-tamoxifen, an anticancer drug labelled with a stable nitrogen isotope used as a tracer. By measuring 15 N enrichment over time, we were able to measure the increase of tamoxifen con- tent in algae. This enrichment was measured by an elemental analyser coupled with an isotopic ratio mass spectrometer (EA–IRMS). Algal cells were exposed for 7 d to 3 concentrations of tamoxifen: 1, 10 and 100 lg L 1. Our result shows a high <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>in</b> algae from the first minutes of contact. The highest bioconcentration factor measured is around 26500. We also observe that bioconcentration is not linked to the exposure concentration. This study is the first to use stable isotopes in order to monitor PCs in aquatic organisms such as algae. The use of stable isotopes in ecotoxicology offers interesting perspectives in the field of contaminant transfer in organisms and along the trophic web...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} dredged {{sediment}} reuse {{on the production}} and bioconcentration of monomethylmercury (MMHg) was investigated by examining sediments and ragworms found in dredge material banks and surrounding sites in the Venice Lagoon, Italy. Total Hg concentrations in the surface 20 cm of sediments {{were higher in the}} banks than in the surrounding sites, but MMHg concentrations were similar, which suggests reduced MMHg production in the banks. Monomethylmercury content in ragworms was significantly lower (p ?<? 0. 05) in the banks than in the surrounding sites. In pore water, concentrations of both sulfate and Fe decreased with depth in the upper 20 cm of the dredge banks. In contrast, sulfate concentrations were constant with depth and large amounts of dissolved Fe occurred in the upper 20 cm of sediments of surrounding sites. Continuous sulfate reduction and possible precipitation of iron sulfide may decrease the production and <b>bioconcentration</b> of MMHg <b>in</b> the dredge material banks compared to the surrounding sites. Overall, the production of MMHg in sediments and its <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>in</b> benthic organisms were connected to the process of sediment diagenesis of organic matter through the control of pore water and sediment geochemistry involving iron and sulfur...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{resulting}} from a water soluble fraction (WSF) of an Arabian crude oil were tested in vivo on the <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>in</b> muscles and on immune parameters in sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax. After 15 days of acclimation, fish were acutely exposed (48 h) to the WSF of 25 g of oil, {{and then returned to}} clean sea water for a 15 day recovery period. PAH concentration in the WSF {{at the beginning of the}} exposure was estimated to 773 ± 187 ng L⁻¹ similar to that observed in the marine environment after an oil spill. The WSF in the experimental system was composed by lightest PAH compounds and did not remain constant during the two days of exposure. Just after exposure to the WSF, a total mean concentration of 148 ± 46 μg kg⁻¹ of PAHs was found <b>in</b> contaminated <b>fish</b> muscle, composed of parent and alkylated naphthalene compounds (86. 5 %), benzo[a]pyrene (10. 1 %) and benzo[b+k]fluoranthene (3. 4 %). In addition, a decrease of leucocytes counts due to a lymphopenia and granulopenia and an increase of the haemolytic activity of the alternative pathway (ACH₅₀) were noted. After a 15 day recovery period, haematocrit was decreased whereas effects on the blood granulocytes of fish seemed to be reversible, contrary to the specific immune system and quality of flesh. <b>In</b> fact, contaminated <b>fish</b> had still less lymphocyte cells compared to controls fish and their flesh were still contaminated by naphthalene and benzo[a]pyrene creating a risk for human consumers...|$|R
