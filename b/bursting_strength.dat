25|$|Hyder Ali, {{prince of}} Mysore, {{developed}} war bombs with an important change: {{the use of}} metal pipes to contain the combustion powder. Although the hammered soft iron he used was crude, the <b>bursting</b> <b>strength</b> of the container of black powder was {{much higher than the}} earlier paper construction. Thus a greater internal pressure was possible, with a resultant greater thrust of the propulsive jet. The rocket body was lashed with leather thongs to a long bamboo stick. Range was perhaps up to three-quarters of a mile (more than a kilometer). Although individually these rockets were not accurate, dispersion error became less important when large numbers were fired rapidly in mass attacks. They were particularly effective against cavalry and were hurled into the air, after lighting, or skimmed along the hard dry ground. Hyder Ali's son, Tippu Sultan, continued to develop and expand the use of rocket weapons, reportedly increasing the number of rocket troops from 1,200 to a corps of 5,000. In battles at Seringapatam in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British.|$|E

The derived predictive equations involve a Limit-State-Design methodology, a methodology common in building structures, but novel in its application to drill casings. The potential exploitation of the software algorithms is currently being evaluated. Accurately predicting the <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> is very important in the casing design for the oil and gas industry. In this paper, finite element analysis is performed for an infinitely long thick walled casing with geometrical imperfections subjected to internal pressure. A comparison with a series of full-scale experiments was conducted to verify the accuracy and reliability of the finite element analysis. Furthermore, three predictive equations were evaluated using the test data, and the Klever equation was concluded to give the most accurate prediction of <b>burst</b> <b>strength.</b> The finite element analysis was then extended to study the effects of major factors on the casing <b>burst</b> <b>strength.</b> Results showed that the initial eccentricity and material hardening parameter had important effects on the <b>burst</b> <b>strength,</b> while the effect of the initial ovality was small.

40|$|Investigation of the {{pressure}} load carrying capacity and fatigue strength of filament-wound glass-reinforced plastic pressure vessels subjected to static and cyclic loading at ambient and cryogenic (liquid nitrogen) temperature environments. The {{results indicate that the}} static fatigue problem is not critical at cryogenic temperatures. Under static loading at liquid nitrogen temperature, a reinforced plastic cylinder sustained pressurization for 88 days without failure at about 90 % of the single cycle <b>burst</b> <b>strength.</b> At ambient temperature, the static life at 90 % of the <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> was about 7 min.

40|$|The {{internal}} pressure strength of tubing and casing often cannot satisfy the design requirements in high pressure, high temperature and high H 2 S gas wells. Also, the practical safety coefficient of some wells {{is lower than}} the design standard according to the current API 5 C 3 standard, which brings some perplexity to the design. The ISO 10400 : 2007 provides the model which can calculate the <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> of tubing and casing better than API 5 C 3 standard, but the calculation accuracy is not desirable because about 50 percent predictive values are remarkably higher than real burst values. So, for the sake of improving strength design of tubing and casing, this paper deduces the plastic limit pressure of tubing and casing under {{internal pressure}} by applying the twin shear unified strength theory. According to the research of the influence rule of yield-to-tensile strength ratio and mechanical properties on the <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> of tubing and casing, the more precise calculation model of tubing-casing’s <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> has been established with material hardening and intermediate principal stress.

40|$|Plastic bottles {{used for}} {{carbonated soft drink}} (CSD) {{packages}} are most commonly made from poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) by {{injection stretch blow molding}} (ISBM). The required bottle performance criteria vary with its application but typically include top-load <b>strength,</b> <b>burst</b> <b>strength,</b> optical clarity, thermal stability, and barrier properties. An experimental study of the preform reheat temperature was carried out for a 1. 5 -l PET bottle produced by a two-stage ISBM machine. The overall temperature of the preform was changed by controlling the reheat temperature of the preform; all the other process variables and preform dimensions were kept constant. Performance of the PET bottles for differing preform reheat temperatures was measured experimentally in terms of top-load <b>strength,</b> <b>burst</b> pressure resistance, environmental stress cracking resistance (ESCR), and thermal stability. It was observed that the ESCR values and the <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> decreased with the increasing reheat temperature, whereas the top-load strength increased. Thermal stability tests confirmed that high-preform reheat temperatures had a detrimental effect on the self-standing feature of the bottles.

Several tube configurations were tested {{to assess the}} effects of reinforcement on tube mechanical properties. Between the electrospun layers of each double-layered prosthetic, zero, one or two 6 - 0 sutures were wound, maintaining 1 mm spacing with a pitch of 9 degrees. Single-layered tubes without suture were also examined. Samples were cross-linked and tested for compliance and <b>burst</b> <b>strength.</b> Compliance decreased significantly (p < 0. 05) and <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> significantly increased (p < 0. 01) with reinforcement. Uncross-linked tubes were also tested {{to determine the effects}} of cross-linking. Results demonstrated that cross-linking significantly decreases <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> (p < 0. 01), while decreases in compliance for cross-linked tubes were not significant. Cross-linked suture-reinforced PDO-elastin tubes had burst pressures more than 10 times greater than normal systolic pressures and exhibited a range of compliance values, including those matching native artery. These tubes display many characteristics of the "ideal" small-diameter graft, having mechanical properties that can be tailored to match those desired in vascular replacement applications...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that arterial baroreflex (ABR) -mediated beat-to-beat control over muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) is progressively modulated as orthostatic stress increases in humans, but that this control becomes impaired just {{before the onset of}} orthostatic syncope. In 17 healthy subjects, the ABR control over MSNA (<b>burst</b> incidence, <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> and total MSNA) was evaluated by analysing the relationship between beat-to-beat spontaneous variations in diastolic blood pressure (DAP) and MSNA during supine rest (control) and during progressive, stepwise increases in lower body negative pressure (LBNP) that were incremented by − 10 mmHg every 5 min until presyncope (nine subjects) or − 60 mmHg was reached. (1) The linear relationships between DAP and <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> and between DAP and total MSNA were shifted progressively upward as LBNP increased until the level at which syncope occurred. The relationship between DAP and burst incidence, however, gradually shifted upward from control only to LBNP = − 30 mmHg; there was no further upward shift at higher LBNPs. (2) Although the slope of the relationship between DAP and <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> and between DAP and total MSNA remained constant at all LBNPs tested, except at the level where syncope occurred, the slope of the relationship between DAP and burst incidence was reduced at LBNPs of − 40 mmHg and higher (versus control). (3) In syncopal subjects, the slopes of the relationships between DAP and <b>burst</b> incidence, <b>burst</b> <b>strength,</b> and total MSNA were all substantially reduced during the 1 – 2 min period prior to the onset of syncope. Taken together, these results suggest baroreflex control over MSNA is progressively modulated as orthostatic stress increases, so that its sensitivity is substantially reduced during the period immediately preceding the severe hypotension associated with orthostatic syncope...|$|R
