5|$|Twice in May 1940 Churchill <b>broached</b> {{the subject}} of {{bringing}} Lloyd George into the government. Each time Chamberlain indicated that due to their longtime antipathy he would immediately retire if Lloyd George were appointed a minister. Churchill did not appoint Lloyd George, but brought up the subject with Chamberlain again early in June. This time, Chamberlain agreed to Lloyd George's appointment provided Lloyd George gave a personal assurance to put aside the feud. However, Lloyd George declined to serve in Churchill's government.|$|E
5|$|The tower has {{numerous}} put-log holes, and {{is supported}} on four massive columns and surmounted by a nineteenth century low octagonal <b>broached</b> short slated recessed slated spire with fish-scale slates and weathercock. There are nineteenth century louvred paired cusped bell-lights and a corbelled embattled parapet. The tower contains a fine peal of bells, with {{the oldest of}} the original set of six being cast in 1749 by Rudhall bell foundry. Two were added in 1886, when the bell chamber was renovated. Two more were added to mark the new millennium in 2000, when some of the others were recast or tuned. The work was completed by Spring 2001. The tower presents one of the more noticeable views in Aberystwyth. It also contains a south side clock dated 1859.|$|E
5|$|At 05:13 on 5 August, Bridgeports lookouts spotted Ushant Light. At 06:40, SC-48 sighted a torpedo {{and sounded}} a warning. Two minutes later, men {{on board the}} tender saw the torpedo wake on Bridgeports port quarter. Orders came down for full left rudder and full speed ahead. Bridgeport swung barely out of harm's way as men on her stern {{observed}} the torpedo disappear {{on the port side}} and reappear to starboard. It passed five feet astern, barely clearing the rudder. The starboard battery fired one shot {{in the direction of the}} torpedo—which <b>broached</b> on the starboard quarter—while the port guns fired in the direction from which the torpedo had come. Meanwhile, two destroyers, with a number of subchasers, hurried toward the spot where the torpedo wake had apparently begun and dropped depth charges. Bridgeport ceased fire and resumed her place in the formation. Through all this activity, no one actually saw the submarine that had fired the torpedo.|$|E
5|$|<b>Broaching</b> is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a <b>broach,</b> to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear <b>broaching,</b> which is the more common process, the <b>broach</b> is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear <b>broaches</b> are used in a <b>broaching</b> machine, which is also sometimes shortened to <b>broach.</b> In rotary <b>broaching,</b> the <b>broach</b> is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary <b>broach</b> is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the <b>broach,</b> which makes it very efficient.|$|R
5|$|Horizontal <b>broaching</b> {{machines}} {{are designed for}} pull <b>broaching,</b> surface <b>broaching,</b> continuous <b>broaching,</b> and rotary <b>broaching.</b> Pull style {{machines are}} basically vertical machines laid on the side with a longer stroke. Surface style machines hold the <b>broach</b> stationary while the workpieces are clamped into fixtures that are mounted on a conveyor system. Continuous style machines {{are similar to the}} surface style machines except adapted for internal <b>broaching.</b>|$|R
5|$|Vertical <b>broaching</b> {{machines}} can {{be designed}} for push <b>broaching,</b> pull-down <b>broaching,</b> pull-up <b>broaching,</b> or surface <b>broaching.</b> Push <b>broaching</b> machines are similar to an arbor press with a guided ram; typical capacities are 5 to 50 tons. The two ram pull-down machine {{is the most common}} type of <b>broaching</b> machine. This style machine has the rams under the table. Pull-up machines have the ram above the table; they usually have more than one ram. Most surface <b>broaching</b> is done on a vertical machine.|$|R
5|$|Collins {{discussed}} the possible {{use of nuclear}} weapons in Korea with MacArthur in December, and later asked him for a list of targets in the Soviet Union in case it entered the war. MacArthur testified before the Congress in 1951 that he had never recommended the {{use of nuclear weapons}}. He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later <b>broached</b> the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a statement by Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.|$|E
5|$|No {{trace of}} the monitor was found until the corpse of a sailor in a dinghy and a few {{lifebuoys}} washed ashore on the Finnish island of Kremare. Extensive searches of the sea bottom also failed to locate the ship. In January 1894 a commission appointed to investigate convened and reprimanded Rear Admiral P. S. Burachek, commander of the detachment, for letting Rusalka go to sea in bad weather as well as Lushkov for losing contact with the monitor. The commission concluded that the ship's steering gear failed or that water had entered the ship and caused her to lose power. Either would have caused Rusalka to turn parallel to the waves where her superstructure would have been demolished and extensive flooding would have soon overwhelmed her small reserve of buoyancy. Whatever the cause, Rusalka obviously <b>broached</b> and sank {{with the loss of}} all 177 members of her crew.|$|E
5|$|In 1198, Pope Innocent III <b>broached</b> {{the subject}} of a new crusade through legates and {{encyclical}} letters. The stated intent of the crusade was to conquer Egypt, now the centre of Muslim power in the Levant. The crusader army that arrived at Venice in the summer of 1202 was somewhat smaller than had been anticipated, and there were not sufficient funds to pay the Venetians, whose fleet was hired by the crusaders to take them to Egypt. Venetian policy under the ageing and blind but still ambitious Doge Enrico Dandolo was potentially at variance with that of the Pope and the crusaders, because Venice was closely related commercially with Egypt. The crusaders accepted the suggestion that in lieu of payment they assist the Venetians in the capture of the (Christian) port of Zara in Dalmatia (vassal city of Venice, which had rebelled and placed itself under Hungary's protection in 1186). The city fell in November 1202 after a brief siege. Innocent tried to forbid this political attack on a Christian city, but was ignored. Reluctant to jeopardise his own agenda for the Crusade, he gave conditional absolution to the crusaders—not, however, to the Venetians.|$|E
5|$|Internal <b>broaching</b> is more involved. The {{process begins}} by {{clamping}} the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the <b>broaching</b> machine. The <b>broaching</b> machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the <b>broach</b> above the workholder, then lowers the <b>broach</b> through the workpiece. Once through, the <b>broaching</b> machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the <b>broach.</b> The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the <b>broach</b> through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the <b>broach</b> is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The <b>broach</b> usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|R
5|$|<b>Broaching</b> was {{originally}} developed for machining internal keyways. However, {{it was soon}} discovered that <b>broaching</b> is very useful for machining other surfaces and shapes for high volume workpieces. Because each <b>broach</b> is specialized to cut just one shape, either the <b>broach</b> must be specially designed for the geometry of the workpiece or the workpiece must be designed around a standard <b>broach</b> geometry. A customized <b>broach</b> is usually only viable with high volume workpieces, because the <b>broach</b> can cost US$15,000 to US$30,000 to produce.|$|R
5|$|Solid <b>broaches</b> are {{the most}} common type; they are made from one solid piece of material. For <b>broaches</b> that wear out quickly shell <b>broaches</b> are used; these <b>broaches</b> are similar to a solid <b>broach,</b> except there is a hole through the center where it mounts on an arbor. Shell <b>broaches</b> cost more initially, but save the cost overall if the <b>broach</b> must be {{replaced}} often because the pilots are on the mandrel and {{do not have to be}} reproduced with each replacement.|$|R
5|$|Luther <b>broached</b> {{the subject}} with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, who was {{simultaneously}} developing a similar scheme. By 18 June, Hitler and Ribbentrop spoke of the Plan with Italian leader Benito Mussolini as a possibility that could be pursued after the defeat of France. Once he learned of the plan, SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), insisted that Ribbentrop relinquish any future responsibility for the Plan to that office. As Heydrich had been appointed by Göring in January 1939 to oversee Jewish evacuation from German-occupied territory, the Jewish question was hence under his purview. Adolf Eichmann, head of the RSHA Sub-Department IV-B4, which dealt with Jewish affairs and evacuation, soon became involved. On 15 August, he released a memorandum titled Reichssicherheitshauptamt: Madagaskar Projekt (Reich Main Security Office: Madagascar Project), calling for the resettlement of a million Jews per year {{for four years and}} abandoning the idea of retaining any Jews in Europe. The RSHA, he emphasized, would control all aspects of the program. While Rademacher called for the colony to be under German control but self-governing under Jewish administration, Eichmann made it plain that he intended for the SS to control and oversee every aspect of life on the island, which they would govern as a police state.|$|E
5|$|Robert Baden-Powell {{had become}} a {{national}} hero during the Boer War {{as a result of}} his successful defence of the town of Mafeking, which was under siege from October 1899 to May 1900. The Mafeking Cadets, made up of local boys aged 12 to 15, acted as messengers throughout the siege, and had impressed him with their resourcefulness and courage. Baden-Powell had also published a number of popular books on military scouting, including Aids to Scouting for NCOs and Men, published in 1899. Though written for non-commissioned officers, it became a best-seller and was used by teachers and youth organisations. In the years after the war Baden-Powell <b>broached</b> the idea of a new youth organisation with a number of people, including William Alexander Smith, founder of the Boys' Brigade, with whom he discussed setting up a Boys Brigade Scouting achievement. To test his ideas while writing Scouting for Boys, Baden-Powell conceived of an experimental camp, creating a program to take place on Brownsea Island during the summer of 1907. He invited his lifelong friend, Major Kenneth McLaren, to attend the camp as an assistant.|$|E

5|$|A {{common type}} of {{internal}} <b>broach</b> is the keyway <b>broach</b> (C & D). It uses a special fixture called a horn to support the <b>broach</b> and properly locate the part with relation to the <b>broach.</b>|$|R

25|$|A type of skiving that is {{analogous}} to the hobbing of external gears {{can be applied to the}} cutting of internal gears, which are skived with a rotary cutter (rather than shaped or <b>broached).</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{somewhat}} different design of cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} <b>broach</b> is called a rotary <b>broach</b> or wobble <b>broach.</b> One of the biggest advantages {{to this type of}} <b>broaching</b> {{is that it does not}} require a <b>broaching</b> machine, but instead is used on lathes, milling machines, screw machines or Swiss lathes.|$|R
5|$|The process {{depends on}} the type of <b>broaching</b> being performed. Surface <b>broaching</b> is very simple as either the {{workpiece}} is moved against a stationary surface <b>broach,</b> or the workpiece is held stationary while the <b>broach</b> is moved against it.|$|R

25|$|On 4 December 2012 Report Mainz <b>broached</b> {{the issue}} for a third time, this time {{particularly}} {{with regards to the}} allegation of Judge Brixner's bias in the case. He arranged a call at the tax authorities, that Mollath's allegations were not being pursued.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism some {{progress}} has been made in the areas of women in early Buddhism, monasticism and Mahayana Buddhism. Two articles have seriously <b>broached</b> the subject of women in Indian tantric Buddhism, while somewhat more attention has been paid to Tibetan nuns and lay yoginis.|$|E
50|$|Rotary <b>broaching</b> {{is another}} common operation. The <b>broach</b> holder is mounted {{stationary}} while its internal live spindle and end cutting <b>broach</b> tool {{are driven by}} the workpiece. As the <b>broach</b> is fed into or around the workpiece, the <b>broach's</b> contact points are constantly changing, easily creating the desired form. The most common form made this way is a hexagonal socket {{in the end of}} a cap screw.|$|R
5|$|For {{internal}} <b>broaching</b> {{the sides}} of the <b>broach</b> are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external <b>broaching</b> the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the <b>broach</b> from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the <b>broach</b> is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the <b>broach</b> is pressed against the workpiece, but is driven by the tool holder.|$|R
50|$|Using {{lubricant}} or coolant {{with any}} type of <b>broach</b> cutter is a must. A correct lubrication and coolant delivery more life for <b>broach</b> cutters. The very important thing {{to know is that}} TCT <b>broach</b> cutters require Coolant, not lubricant and HSS <b>broach</b> cutters required Cutting oil, not coolant.|$|R
25|$|When the Rudd Labor {{opposition}} first <b>broached</b> {{the proposal}} to develop and {{put in place a}} national broadband program it was dismissed by the Howard government as unnecessary.

25|$|Clemente's #21 remains {{active in}} MLB and is worn by {{multiple}} players. Sammy Sosa wore #21 {{throughout his career}} as a tribute to his childhood hero. The number is unofficially retired in the Puerto Rico Baseball League. While the topic of retiring #21 throughout Major League Baseball like Jackie Robinson's #42 has been <b>broached,</b> and supported by groups such as Hispanics Across America, Jackie Robinson's daughter disagrees, believing that MLB should honor him another way.|$|E
5|$|Slot <b>broaches</b> (G & H) are {{for cutting}} slots of various {{dimensions}} at high production rates. Slot <b>broaching</b> is much quicker than milling {{when more than}} one slot needs to be machined, because multiple <b>broaches</b> can be run through the part {{at the same time}} on the same <b>broaching</b> machine.|$|R
500|$|Straddle <b>broaches</b> use two slab <b>broaches</b> to cut {{parallel}} surfaces {{on opposite}} sides of a workpiece in one pass.
