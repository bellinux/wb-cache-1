5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream {{of the open}} reading frame that alter expression. These act by <b>binding</b> to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase <b>binding</b> site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by <b>binding</b> an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.|$|E
5|$|In non-competitive inhibition, the <b>binding</b> of the {{inhibitor}} to {{the enzyme}} reduces its activity {{but does not}} affect the <b>binding</b> of substrate. As a result, the extent of inhibition depends only on the concentration of the inhibitor. Vmax will decrease due to the inability for the reaction to proceed as efficiently, but Km will remain the same as the actual <b>binding</b> of the substrate, by definition, will still function properly.|$|E

5|$|The {{base of the}} Y {{plays a role in}} {{modulating}} immune cell activity. This {{region is}} called the Fc (Fragment, crystallizable) region, and is composed of two heavy chains that contribute two or three constant domains depending on the class of the antibody. Thus, the Fc region ensures that each antibody generates an appropriate immune response for a given antigen, by <b>binding</b> to a specific class of Fc receptors, and other immune molecules, such as complement proteins. By doing this, it mediates different physiological effects including recognition of opsonized particles (<b>binding</b> to FcγR), lysis of cells (<b>binding</b> to complement), and degranulation of mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils (<b>binding</b> to FcεR).|$|E

5|$|When {{an enzyme}} has {{multiple}} substrates, inhibitors can show {{different types of}} inhibition depending on which substrate is considered. This results from the active site containing two different <b>binding</b> sites within the active site, one for each substrate. For example, an inhibitor might compete with substrate A for the first <b>binding</b> site, but be a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to substrate B in the second <b>binding</b> site.|$|E
25|$|The <b>binding</b> of the N-acetyl {{group is}} more complex and less known. The {{important}} amino acids in the <b>binding</b> pocket for this group differ between the two receptors. Serines, Ser110 and Ser114, in the TM3 domain seem to be important for <b>binding</b> to the MT1 receptor. However, aspargine 175 (Asn) in the TM4 domain {{is likely to be}} important for the MT2 receptor. The aromatic ring system in melatonin and analogues most likely contributes some <b>binding</b> affinity by <b>binding</b> to aromatic rings of the amino acids phenylalanine (Phe) and tryptophan (Trp) in the receptor. The bonds that form are van der Waals interactions. The N-acetyl <b>binding</b> and <b>binding</b> pocket, <b>binding</b> of the ring system and important domains are somewhat known and need further investigation.|$|E
25|$|The {{interaction}} of most ligands with their <b>binding</b> sites {{can be characterized}} {{in terms of a}} <b>binding</b> affinity. In general, high-affinity ligand <b>binding</b> results from greater intermolecular force between the ligand and its receptor while low-affinity ligand <b>binding</b> involves less intermolecular force between the ligand and its receptor. In general, high-affinity <b>binding</b> results in a higher degree of occupancy for the ligand at its receptor <b>binding</b> site than is the case for low-affinity binding; the residence time (lifetime of the receptor-ligand complex) does not correlate. High-affinity <b>binding</b> of ligands to receptors is often physiologically important when some of the <b>binding</b> energy can be used to cause a conformational change in the receptor, resulting in altered behavior of an associated ion channel or enzyme.|$|E

40|$|International audienceModern GUI toolkits {{propose the}} use of {{declarative}} data <b>bindings</b> to link the domain data to their presentations. These approaches work fine for defining simple <b>bindings,</b> but require an increasing programming effort {{as soon as the}} <b>bindings</b> become more complex. In this paper, we propose {{the use of}} active operations for specifying and implementing UI data <b>bindings</b> to tackle this issue. We demonstrate that the proposed approach goes beyond the usual declarative data <b>bindings</b> by combining the simplicity of the declarative approaches with the expressiveness of active operations...|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{associative}} arrays {{may also}} include other operations such as determining {{the number of}} <b>bindings</b> or constructing an iterator to loop over all the <b>bindings.</b> Usually, for such an operation, {{the order in which}} the <b>bindings</b> are returned may be arbitrary.|$|R
25|$|Late static <b>binding</b> is {{a variant}} of <b>binding</b> somewhere between static and dynamic <b>binding.</b> The <b>binding</b> of names before the program is run is called static (early); {{bindings}} performed as the program runs are dynamic (late or virtual).|$|E
25|$|<b>Binding</b> {{affinity}} is {{most commonly}} determined using a radiolabeled ligand, {{known as a}} tagged ligand. Homologous competitive <b>binding</b> experiments involve <b>binding</b> competition between a tagged ligand and an untagged ligand.|$|E
25|$|Specific <b>binding</b> {{refers to}} the <b>binding</b> of a ligand to a receptor, and it is {{possible}} that {{there is more than one}} specific <b>binding</b> site for one ligand. Non specific <b>binding</b> {{refers to the}} <b>binding</b> of a ligand to something other than its designated receptor such as various other receptors, or different types of transporters in the cell membrane. For example, various antagonists can bind to multiple types receptors. In the case of muscarinic antagonists, they can also bind to histamine receptors. Such <b>binding</b> patterns are technically considered specific, as the destination of the ligand is specific to multiple receptors. However, researchers may not be focused on such behaviors compared to other <b>binding</b> factors. Nevertheless, nonspecific <b>binding</b> behavior is very important information to acquire. These estimates are measured by examining how a ligand binds to a receptor while simultaneously reacting to a substitute agent (antagonist) that will prevent specific <b>binding</b> to occur.|$|E
40|$|International audienceProof {{assistants and}} the {{programming}} languages that implement them {{need to deal}} with a range of linguistic expressions that involve <b>bindings.</b> Since most mature proof assistants do not have built-in methods to treat this aspect of syntax, many of them have been extended with various packages and libraries that allow them to encode <b>bindings</b> using, for example, de Bruijn numerals and nominal logic features. I put forward the argument that <b>bindings</b> are such an intimate aspect of the structure of expressions that they should be accounted for directly in the underlying programming language support for proof assistants and not added later using packages and libraries. One possible approach to designing programming languages and proof assistants that directly supports such an approach to <b>bindings</b> in syntax is presented. The roots of such an approach {{can be found in the}} mobility of binders between term-level <b>bindings,</b> formula-level <b>bindings</b> (quanti-fiers), and proof-level <b>bindings</b> (eigenvariables). In particular, by combining Church's approach to terms and formulas (found in his Simple Theory of Types) and Gentzen's approach to sequent calculus proofs, we can learn how <b>bindings</b> can declaratively interact with the full range of logical connectives and quantifiers. I will also illustrate how that framework provides an intimate and semantically clean treatment of computation and reasoning with syntax containing <b>bindings.</b> Some implemented systems, which support this intimate and built-in treatment of <b>bindings,</b> will be briefly described...|$|R

25|$|Plate <b>bindings</b> {{are used}} with hardboots on Alpine or racing snowboards. Extreme carvers and some Boarder Cross racers also use plate <b>bindings.</b> The stiff <b>bindings</b> and boots give much {{more control over}} the board and allow the board to be carved much more easily than with softer <b>bindings.</b> Alpine snowboards tend to be longer and thinner with a much stiffer flex for greater edge hold and better carving performance.|$|R
25|$|Competition <b>Binding</b> {{is used to}} {{determine}} the presence of selectivity for a particular ligand for receptor sub-types, which allows the determination of the density and proportion of each sub-type in the tissue. Competition curves are obtained by plotting specific <b>binding,</b> which is the percentage of the total <b>binding,</b> against the log concentration of the competing ligand. A steep competition curve is usually indicative of <b>binding</b> to a single population of receptors, whereas a shallow curve, or a curve with clear inflection points, is indicative of multiple populations of <b>binding</b> sites.|$|E
25|$|In {{the example}} {{shown to the}} left, ligand-binding curves are shown for two ligands with {{different}} <b>binding</b> affinities. Ligand <b>binding</b> is often characterized {{in terms of the}} concentration of ligand at which half of the receptor <b>binding</b> sites are occupied, known as the IC50, which is related to but different from the dissociation constant. The ligand illustrated by the red curve has a higher <b>binding</b> affinity and smaller Kd than the ligand illustrated by the green curve. If these two ligands were present at the same time, more of the higher-affinity ligand would be bound to the available receptor <b>binding</b> sites. This is how carbon monoxide can compete with oxygen in <b>binding</b> to hemoglobin, resulting in carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|E
25|$|In the tetrameric form {{of normal}} adult hemoglobin, the <b>binding</b> of oxygen is, thus, a {{cooperative}} process. The <b>binding</b> affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is increased by the oxygen saturation of the molecule, {{with the first}} molecules of oxygen bound influencing {{the shape of the}} <b>binding</b> sites for the next ones, in a way favorable for <b>binding.</b> This positive cooperative <b>binding</b> is achieved through steric conformational changes of the hemoglobin protein complex as discussed above; i.e., when one subunit protein in hemoglobin becomes oxygenated, a conformational or structural change in the whole complex is initiated, causing the other subunits to gain an increased affinity for oxygen. As a consequence, the oxygen <b>binding</b> curve of hemoglobin is sigmoidal, or S-shaped, as opposed to the normal hyperbolic curve associated with noncooperative <b>binding.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{creating}} new work, modern hand binders often work on commission, creating <b>bindings</b> for specific books or collections. Books can be bound {{in many different}} materials. Some of the more common materials for covers are leather, decorative paper, and cloth (see also: buckram). Those <b>bindings</b> that are made with exceptionally high craftsmanship, and that are made of particularly high-quality materials (especially full leather <b>bindings),</b> are known as fine or extra <b>bindings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Multi-section Coptic <b>bindings</b> had {{cover boards}} that were {{initially}} composed of layers of papyrus, though by the 4th century, wooden boards were also frequent.

50|$|Many pineboarders now use <b>bindings.</b> It {{allows for}} more tricks, {{including}} large jumps and better rotations, and more stability.

Shoelaces attached to the board can be tightened {{over the top of the}} back of your shoe to keep it from slipping out.|$|R
25|$|Before the {{computer}} age, the bookbinding trade involved two divisions. First, there was Stationery <b>binding</b> (known as vellum <b>binding</b> in the trade) {{which deals with}} making new books {{to be written into}} and intended for handwritten entries such as accounting ledgers, business journals, blank books, and guest log books, along with other general office stationery such as note books, manifold books, day books, diaries, portfolios, etc. Second was Letterpress <b>binding</b> which deals with making new books intended to be read from and includes library <b>binding,</b> fine <b>binding,</b> edition <b>binding,</b> and publisher's bindings. A result of the new bindings is a third division dealing with the repair, restoration, and conservation of old used bindings. With the digital age, personal computers have replaced the pen and paper based accounting that used to drive most of the work in the stationery <b>binding</b> industry.|$|E
25|$|Further {{research}} by the same group showed that (R)-citalopram also enhances <b>binding</b> of escitalopram, and therefore the allosteric interaction cannot explain the observed counteracting effect. In the most recent paper, however, the same authors again reversed their findings and reported that (R)-citalopram decreases <b>binding</b> of escitalopram to the transporter. Although allosteric <b>binding</b> of escitalopram to the serotonin transporter is of unquestionable research interest, its clinical relevance is unclear since the <b>binding</b> of escitalopram to the allosteric site is at least 1000 times weaker than to the primary <b>binding</b> site.|$|E
