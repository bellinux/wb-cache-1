[...] One participant interviewed by The New York Times said, [...] "The democracy they have <b>been</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> is already here, but the Shias, they have their ayatollahs, and whatever they say, they will run and do it.

[...] "The issue of flexibility must be addressed, and quickly", said the leader of CGPME (France's association of SMEs) and Laurence Parisot, leader of MEDEF (France's major employers' union). MEDEF and CGPME expected the government to push for stronger reforms.|$|E

[...] It rejected residents' suggestions to schedule the Narrabeen tram first, {{and to make the}} first set-down Dee Why or similar place. For nearly a decade from at least 1923, residents had <b>been</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> faster services to Narrabeen. [...] The trip took 49 minutes.

[...] The agreed upon price was not disclosed, but those familiar with the situation said getting a lower price than European buyers was a key demand of China in the negotiations. [...] However, Russian representatives said the price would fluctuate based on the market price of oil, making the deal closer to what Russia had wanted than to what China had <b>been</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for.</b> [...] The total value of the deal was estimated at US$400 billion. [...] It will increase Russian exports to countries {{not part of the}} former Soviet Union by 25% and make China the country's 2nd largest customer, after Germany.|$|E

Agere Systems spokesman Glen Haley confirmed the deal. Agere Systems had <b>been</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> $8 million for the property, but Haley and Call declined to disclose the purchase price. The assessment of the property was lowered to $9.5 million from $26.3 million after Agere Systems appealed.

[...] Kent embarked on two accompanying US tours to promote the album. [...] The first was in support of fellow Swedes, The Cardigans, during which they highlighted new song, [...] "Protection", and the second was a double-bill with American band, Papa Vegas. [...] The band would close the shows for the second leg of the tour with what they described as their [...] "only cover song", a version of Depeche Mode's classic single, [...] "Stripped". [...] Singles were released in various territories for three of the album's songs, [...] "If You Were Here", [...] "Things She Said" [...] and [...] "747" [...] (featuring the English version of [...] "Kräm", entitled [...] "What It Feels Like").

2500|$|In April 2005, {{following}} {{the confirmation of}} asbestos fibres found on tree roots, the council asked developers to provide more detailed information relating to their contaminated land surveys, and placed the application on hold. They also announced that they were considering appointing their own environmental consultants to examine the site. Jason Addy said: [...] "This {{is what we have}} <b>been</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> since day one. The information handed in with the planning application was inaccurate, misleading and avoided many issues. As this site begins to reveal more of its murky secrets people are realising just how contaminated it is. We are very concerned about the asbestos contamination on the site. We are very worried about the way this is going, if it wasn't so serious it would be a farce." [...] Rochdale councillor William Hobhouse said: [...] "With no government regulations specifying safe levels of asbestos in soil, it is clear the council, working with outside consultants, will have to formulate what percentage of asbestos in the soil is safe." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Bulldogs {{left the}} WWF in 1988, {{in part due}} to {{backstage}} problems between the Bulldogs, specifically the Dynamite Kid, and the Rougeau Brothers over a prank pulled by Curt Hennig. The Bulldogs, noted ribbers (pranksters) in their own right, were blamed for the prank, leading to a series of confrontations that culminated in Jacques Rougeau knocking out four of the Dynamite Kid's teeth with a fist filled with a roll of quarters. Though there are various accounts of this situation, many suggest that Billington drew first blood by bullying Rougeau (among many others including The Honky Tonk Man, whom Dynamite, allegedly, brought to tears) in Miami. While Rougeau was playing cards backstage, from behind, Billington smacked Jacques in the ear and then punched and kicked him in the face several times and also struck Raymond, who was on crutches at the time. It was weeks before Jacques responded. Bret Hart wrote about the incident, in his book HITMAN: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling: [...] "At first I was upset, and contemplated getting involved. But the more I thought about it the more I realized that Tom had <b>been</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> this for years and that everyone who'd been bullied by him would rejoice at the news." [...] After no disciplinary action was taken against Jacques, Billington quit the WWF, and Smith followed suit.|$|E

Four dimensions of working time were investigated, notably number of working hours, timing of work, predictability {{and control over}} hours, and commuting time. Although almost all questionnaires <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> hours worked, the terminology varies greatly. In {{only half of the}} cases a reference period is taken into account and in half the reasons for working more/less in the survey week than usual <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for.</b> Contractual hours <b>are</b> hardly <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> and so <b>are</b> paid and unpaid overtime hours. The timing of work <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> in a minority of the questionnaires, and predictability and control over working hours is also not a major issue. The incidence of an on-call contract is the most likely proxy for predictability...|$|R
2500|$|Crosby pursued Polly, and in May 1921, {{when she}} would not respond to his ardor, Crosby {{threatened}} suicide if Polly did not marry him. Polly's husband {{was in and out}} of sanitariums several times, fighting alcoholism. Crosby pestered Polly to tell her husband of their affair and to divorce him. In May, she revealed her adultery to Dick and suggested a separation, and he offered no resistance. Polly's mother insisted that she stop seeing Crosby for six months to avoid complete rejection by her society peers, a condition she agreed to, and she left Boston for New York. Divorce was [...] "unheard of...even among Boston Episcopalians." [...] Peabody's parents were outraged that she would ask for a divorce and at her affair with Crosby. Dick's father Jacob Peabody even visited Harry's father, Stephen Crosby, on January 4, 1922 to discuss the situation, but Harry's father would not talk to him; despite his disapproval of Harry's irregular behavior, he loved his son. Stephen Crosby at first attempted to dissuade Harry from marrying Polly, and even bought him the Stutz he'd <b>been</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for,</b> but Harry would not be persuaded to change his mind. For her part, Polly's former friends pilloried her as an adulteress, leaving Polly stunned by the quick turn-about in their attitude towards her. Polly later described Harry's character as: [...] "He seemed to be more expression and mood, than man," [...] she wrote, [...] "yet he was the most vivid personality I've ever known, electric with rebellion." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{ball was}} a leg bye to bring Rick McCosker on strike and he glance the ball off his legs {{to bring up}} his first Test runs to the applause of the 52,164 strong crowd. He made 80 on debut and added 96 with Redpath as the England fast bowlers missed their chance with the new ball and the pitch proved to be truer than expected. McCosker edged a ball that fell short of Alan Knott, slashed another that was missed by Edrich in the gully and Redpath nearly ran himself out off a no-ball (photographs later showed {{that he should have}} been out). The England captain set {{defensive}} fields from the outset, with a third and fine leg and only three close fielders and Australia were in little trouble. Redpath was hit on the hand by Bob Willis and finally out when he trod on his stumps off Titmus for 33, but McCosker made 80 when he was disturbed by the rumpus from the Sydney Hill. Fans were throwing beer cans at Tony Greig, one hitting him on the back, and Umpire Brooks had to intervene to calm them down and have the field cleared of rubbish before play could resume. McCosker's concentration was disturbed and he was caught by Knott off Greig (4/104) Ian Chappell was almost run out by David Lloyd for a duck, but made 53 before he was caught by Knott off Geoff Arnold (5/86). Ross Edwards came out at 199/3 to the disappointment of his local fans, who wanted their hero Doug Walters to come out and score a century as he had at Perth and had erected the famous [...] "Doug Walters Stand" [...] banner on the Hill. Edwards made only 15 in a stand of 52 with Greg Chappell when he played over a yorker from Greig two balls short of stumps and play was ended early at 251/4. This soon became 255/5 when Arnold took the new ball and nipped it back to catch Walters lbw, but Chappell and Marsh added 50 runs in 56 minutes. They were removed by the ever-combative Grieg, who removed Marsh's middle stump with a yorker and caught Chappell off Arnold when he looked set for a hundred to leave them 310/7. The Australian lower order made runs quickly enough despite being repeatedly bounced by Arnold and Grieg, who hit Lillee on the elbow and bruised Ashley Mallett's bowling hand. Fletcher told Lillee that he had <b>been</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> bouncers the way he bowled and the fast bowler's reply made him complain to Umpire Brooks about his use of language. Two bouncers in one over resulted in Greig being warned for intimatory bowling, who asked if Lillee was restricted to one bouncer per over to him as well. Brooks saying that as Lillee was a tailender and Greig was a batsman the same standard did not apply. In the end Arnold dismissed Lillee and Walker, but Thomson hit 24 not out off 23 balls before Mallet was lbw to Grieg with the score on 405.|$|E

She did not do this only once, and by accident. She did it whenever more straws <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> than she possessed. Did she perform a distinctly reasoning act? or was her action the result of blind, mechanical instinct?
