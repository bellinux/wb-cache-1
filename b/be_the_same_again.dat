25|$|Lumbering became {{important}} to the local economy of Monckton Township by the 1840s and {{in the latter part}} of that same decade, Joseph Salter arrived from Saint John and built a major shipyard at The Bend. Within a few years, over 1000 workers were employed at the shipyard and the sleepy community that had formerly been The Bend would never <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>again.</b> The Bend developed a service based economy to support the shipyard and gradually began to acquire all of the amenities of a growing town. In particular, as the economy strengthened, an important financial institution (the Westmorland Bank) opened and this in turn was able to finance further expansion of the shipbuilding industry.|$|E
500|$|On 28 November 2011, {{referring}} to Pak-US military, intelligence, political and diplomatic co-operation, the Pakistani Prime Minister announced {{that there would}} be no more business with the US and the relations between the two countries would never <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>again.</b> [...] Later the Director General of ISPR, Abbas, announced that NATO's apology was not accepted and the attack would have serious consequences. He said that NATO's regret over the attack was not enough and such incidents had happened in the past, killing 72 soldiers and injuring more than 250 troops in three years. While addressing a gathering of journalists at a military headquarters, Pakistan Army Major-General Ashfaq Nadeem described the Salala incident as a [...] "deliberate act of aggression" [...] and said it was [...] "next to impossible" [...] that NATO did not know they were attacking Pakistani forces.|$|E
500|$|O'Hara's {{first major}} film role {{was that of}} Mary Yellen in Jamaica Inn (1939), {{directed}} by Alfred Hitchcock and co-starring Laughton. O'Hara portrayed the innkeeper's niece, an orphan who goes {{to live with her}} aunt and uncle at a Cornish tavern, a heroine which she describes as [...] "torn between the love of her family and her love for a lawman in disguise". Laughton insisted that she change her name to the shorter [...] "O'Mara" [...] or [...] "O'Hara", and she eventually decided on the latter after expressing contempt at both. [...] When she said [...] "I like Maureen Fitzsimons and I want to keep it", Laughton replied with, [...] "Very well, you're Maureen O'Hara." [...] (O'Hara would later say that [...] "nobody would ever get [...] straight.") [...] O'Hara noted that Laughton had always wanted a daughter of his own, and treated her as such, and she later stated that Laughton's death in 1962 was like losing a parent. She worked well under Hitchcock, professing to have [...] "never experienced the strange feeling of detachment with Hitchcock that many other actors claimed to have felt while working with him." [...] On the contrary, Laughton was engaged in a bitter battle with Hitchcock throughout the production and resented many of Hitchcock's ideas, including changing the nature of the villain from the novel. Though Jamaica Inn is generally seen by critics and the director himself as one of his weakest films, O'Hara was praised, with one critic stating [...] "the newcomer, Maureen O'Hara is charming to look at and distinct promise as an actress". Seeing the film was an eyeopener for O'Hara and change in self-perception, having always seen herself as a tomboy and realizing that on screen she was a woman of great beauty to others. When she returned to Ireland briefly after the film was completed it dawned on her that life would never <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>again,</b> and she was hurt when she attempted to make pleasant conversation to some local girls and they rejected her advances, considering her to be very arrogant.|$|E

It was also the first British fashion show to feature black models. In 1968 Clark designed his first of many diffusion lines for Radley, [...] "Ossie Clark for Radley" [...] that made his clothes available to a high street clientele.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review of The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld, the NME dubbed it [...] "an album sounding like Pink Floyd {{without all the}} self-indulgent solos", concluding that [...] "Reality is inside a pair of headphones overflowing with The Orb. Life will never <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>again.</b> The flotation tank beckons." [...] Selects Russell Brown wrote that [...] "long and strange as it is, Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld is without doubt a good trip." [...] At the end of 1991, Melody Maker ranked it at number 22 on their year-end top albums list, adding that it contained [...] "some of the most unique sounds of the year." ...|$|E
2500|$|Time Outs Phil Harrison {{reviewed}} the hour-long episode {{and gave it}} three out of five stars.

He added [...] "In {{the run-up to the}} terrible incident itself, the cheese is ramped up to Stinking Bishop levels. And then, suddenly, it's out with the old and in with the new. Ramsay Street will never <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>again</b> – although that grim prognosis might not apply to the cockroach-like Paul Robinson, who lurks around the fringes, as sneaky and implacable as ever.

25|$|The 1980s saw a black {{period in}} the history of Hyderabad as riots erupted in the city between the two ethnic diversities in majority, the Sindhis and the Muhajir.

2500|$|... "You {{have all}} these great stories in the book," [...] I told her, [...] "Why don't you use them in the song?" [...] I knew that Madonna was {{developing}} a 1930s dominatrix look for Erotica, but I didn't realize how far {{she was willing to}} go before I saw Sex. It contained stories authored by her mysteriously dark alter, Dita. Madonna took the book {{and walked out of the}} room and didn't come back until about half an hour later. Suddenly she was on the mic, speaking in this very dry voice. [...] "My name is Dita," [...] she said, [...] "and I'll be your mistress tonight." [...] I knew that the original [...] "Erotica" [...] would never <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>again,</b> and it wasn't. The chorus and bridge were changed entirely and the whole psyche of the song became sexier, more to the point. It seemed as if Dita brought out the best in her, actually serving as a vehicle for the dangerous territory she was traveling. Actually, it was the same name Madonna used when she'd stay in hotels around the world. Not anymore.|$|E

60|$|So {{he went to}} bed. But {{there was}} a new {{quietness}} about him which she had wondered at. She almost guessed. She would leave him alone, however. Precipitation might spoil things.
