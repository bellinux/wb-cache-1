40|$|State of the art, many {{drive systems}} like {{those used in}} {{industrial}} robotics, conveyor systems or diverse numerical control machinery have a common DC bus power system architectures. Due to regenerative braking, the DC bus voltage increases until certain limit which is limited in means of balancing resistor (<b>brake</b> <b>chopper).</b> Systems that require rapid cyclic starts and stops are subject of significant energy waste due to extensive use of the <b>brake</b> <b>chopper.</b> In this article, a novel power converter for drive systems is proposed that allows to eliminate the usage of <b>brake</b> <b>chopper</b> and enables the regenerative energy exchange of multiple drive systems within an independent DC subgrid with one centralized energy storage element.

Many industrial applications that require rapid cyclic starts and stops are subject to significant energy waste at the <b>brake</b> <b>chopper</b> of the DC bus due to over voltage during motor deceleration. The proposed solution allows the <b>brake</b> <b>chopper</b> to be eliminated and the otherwise wasted energy to be stored externally.

30|$|When {{the grid}} voltage dips, the <b>brake</b> <b>chopper</b> results in {{negligible}} speed changes {{in both the}} wind turbine and generator, so the speed index cannot completely represent the transient characteristics of the PMSGs. However, as the GSC switches to a reactive power priority control pattern, the DC link voltage undergoes a significant change, and the changes between different operating conditions of PMSGs are obviously different. For the PMSG subjected to a high wind speed, the DC link voltage may continue to rise until {{the threshold of the}} <b>brake</b> <b>chopper,</b> and then the chopper circuit is triggered. As for the PMSG subjected to a low wind speed, the DC link voltage may only show a slight fluctuation in the neighborhood of the normal value (1.0  pu), since the unbalanced active power delivered by the generator to the DC link is relatively small and the DC link voltage can be effectively adjusted by the GSC.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Braking</b> <b>choppers</b> {{some times}} also {{referred}} to as braking unit are used in the DC voltage intermediate circuits of frequency converters to control voltage when the load feeds energy back to the intermediate circuit. This arises, for example, when a magnetized motor is being rotated by an overhauling load and so functions as a generator feeding power to the DC voltage intermediate circuit.They are an application of the [...] chopper principle, using on-off control of a switching device.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} prevent the DC link voltage from rising too roughly, the <b>brake</b> <b>chopper</b> is a simple {{protection}} device that shorts the DC link through a power resistor when the DC link voltage exceeds a fixed threshold. As shown schematically in Fig.  1, an insulated gate bipolar rectifier (IGBT) chopper circuit is used to rapidly engage and disengage the resistor. The chopper works on a hysteresis band, i.e., the turn-off voltage (1.05  pu) is set below the turn-on threshold (1.06  pu).|$|R

The system&# 8217;s first stage is composed of a three-phase boost PWM (Pulse Width Modulated) rectifier with DSP (Digital Signal Processing) based power factor correction (PFC) and output voltage regulation. The second stage is a full-bridge PWM inverter that allows fast four-quadrant operation. The structure is fully reversible, and an additional resistance (<b>brake</b> <b>chopper)</b> is not needed to dissipate the energy when the beam deflection magnet acts as generator...|$|R

There is one traction inverter per traction motor. The traction motors are rated at 600 kW at 4400 rpm. Head end power (for passenger versions) is taken from the intermediate DC link.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} number of wind power plants, several countries have modified their grid codes to include specific requirements for the connection of this technology to the power system. One of the requirements is the ride-through fault capability (RTFC), i. e., the system capability to sustain operation during voltage sags. In this sense, the present paper intends to investigate the behavior of a full-converter wind generator with a permanent magnet synchronous machine during symmetrical and asymmetrical voltage sags. Two solutions to improve the low voltage ride-through capability (LVRT) of this technology are analyzed: discharging resistors (<b>brake</b> <b>chopper)</b> and resonant controllers (RCs). The design and limitations of these solutions and the others proposed in the literature are discussed. Experimental results in a 34 kW test bench, which represents a scaled prototype of a real 2 MW wind conversion system, are presented...|$|R
50|$|Any {{dynamic braking}} {{operation}} {{required for the}} motor can be realized by means of <b>braking</b> DC <b>chopper</b> and resistor shunt connected across the rectifier. Alternatively, an anti-parallel thyristor bridge must be provided in the rectifier section to feed energy back into the AC line. Such phase-controlled thyristor-based rectifiers however have higher AC line distortion and lower power factor at low load than diode-based rectifiers.|$|R
40|$|Currently, the {{electric}} power production by wind energy conversion systems (WECSs) has increased significantly. Consequently, wind turbine (WT) generators are requested {{to fulfill the}} grid code (GC) requirements stated by network operators. In case of grid faults/voltage dips, a mismatch between the generated active power from the wind generator and the active power delivered to the grid is produced. The conventional approach is using a <b>braking</b> <b>chopper</b> (BC) in the DC-link to dissipate this active power. This paper proposes a fault-ride through (FRT) strategy for variable-speed WECSs based on permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs). The proposed strategy exploits the rotor inertia of the WECS (inertia of the WT and PMSG) to store the surplus active power during the grid faults/voltage dips. Thus, no additional hardware components are requested. Furthermore, a direct model predictive control (DMPC) scheme for the PMSG is proposed {{in order to enhance}} the dynamic behavior of the WECS. The behavior of the proposed FRT strategy is verified and compared with the conventional BC approach for all the operation conditions by simulation results. Finally, the simulation results confirm the feasibility of the proposed FRT strategy...|$|R
5|$|Torque {{generated}} by the drive causes the induction motor to run at synchronous speed less the slip. If the load drives the motor faster than synchronous speed, the motor acts as a generator, converting mechanical power back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's DC link element (capacitor or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or <b>braking</b> DC <b>chopper</b> controls dissipation of this power as heat {{in a set of}} resistors. Cooling fans may be used to prevent resistor overheating.|$|R
40|$|Attempts {{to reduce}} {{greenhouse}} gas emissions are promising with the recent dramatic increase of installed renewable energy sources (RES) capacity. Integration of large intermittent renewable resources affects smart grid systems in several significant ways, such as transient and voltage stability, existing protection scheme, and power leveling and energy balancing. To protect the grid from threats related to these issues, utilities impose rigorous technical requirements, more importantly, focusing on fault ride through requirements and active/reactive power responses following disturbances. This dissertation is aimed at developing and verifying the advanced and algorithmic methods for specification of protection schemes, reactive power capability and power control requirements for interconnection of the RESs to the smart grid systems. The first findings of this dissertation verified that the integration of large RESs become more promising from the energy-saving, and downsizing perspective by introducing a resistive superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) as a self-healing equipment. The proposed SFCL decreased the activation of the conventional control scheme for the wind power plant (WPP), such as dc <b>braking</b> <b>chopper</b> and fast pitch angle control systems, thereby increased {{the reliability of the}} system. A static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) has been proposed to assist with the uninterrupted operation of the doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) -based WTs during grid disturbances. The key motivation {{of this study was to}} design a new computational intelligence technique based on a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), for the online coordinated reactive power control between the DFIG and the STATCOM in order to improve the low voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability of the WT during the fault, and to smooth low-frequency oscillations of the active power during the recovery. Furthermore, the application of a three-phase single-stage module-integrated converter (MIC) incorporated into a grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) system was investigated in this dissertation. A new current control scheme based on multivariable PI controller, with a faster dynamic and superior axis decoupling capability compared with the conventional PI control method, was developed and experimentally evaluated for three-phase PV MIC system. Finally, a study was conducted based on the framework of stochastic game theory to enable a power system to dynamically survive concurrent severe multi-failure events, before such failures turn into a full blown cascading failure. This effort provides reliable strategies in the form of insightful guidelines on how to deploy limited budgets for protecting critical components of the smart grid systems...|$|R
40|$|Despite recent {{advances}} in solid-state controls for electric cars, chopper-induced problems still exist: commutation and ac losses are significantly high, the chopping action induces losses within the power source, and large ripple components in the chopper output cause increased rms losses at the motor. The author's dual chopper, two conventional choppers in parallel, reduces these problems. The duty cycle generated by the firing circuit is feedback controlled so that the load current remains proportional to control output. The dual chopper operates in a three-in-one system: in the first mode, the batteries charge at high rates; the second mode controls the amount of power flowing from battery to motor; and in the third or regenerative <b>braking</b> mode, the <b>chopper</b> transfers energy from the motor to the battery...|$|R
