Long-term annual precipitation (APRE) was available at 182 weather stations. Elevation above sea level (ELEV) was available at those stations and at 1913 additional points over a regular 5 km grid. The spatial variability of APRE, ELEV and their <b>base</b> <b>10</b> <b>logarithms</b> (LAPRE and LELEV, respectively), and the spatial correlation between APRE and ELEV, APRE and LELEV, LAPRE and ELEV, and LAPRE and LELEV were described by gaussian direct- and cross-semivariogram models with nugget effects.

The Napierian logarithms were published first in 1614. Henry Briggs introduced common (<b>base</b> <b>10)</b> <b>logarithms,</b> which were easier to use. Tables of logarithms were published in many forms over four centuries. The idea of logarithms was also used to construct the slide rule, which became ubiquitous in science and engineering until the 1970s.

40|$|This short {{guide is}} written to provide users with the steps {{needed for the}} {{conversion}} of intensities between the HITRAN database [1] and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) [2] or Cologne Database for Molecular Spectroscopy (CDMS) [3] spectral databases. The JPL and CDMS lists, which are identical in their intensity formalisms, provide <b>base</b> <b>10</b> <b>logarithms</b> of the integrated intensity at 300 K (in nm 2 MHz), while HITRAN gives the intensity at 296 K [in cm- 1 /(molecule/cm 2) ]. Apart from these differences, there are certain differences in the formalism of intensities and this guide provides steps for the most accurate conversion. If accuracy better than 2 % is not required, it is fairly safe to use an approximation given in Section 5 below. Some other intensity unit conversions are described in the textbook of Bernath [4]. An appendix is also provided {{at the end of}} this guide that gives definitions of some of the quantities in the databases. 1. Unit conversion The JPL [2] and CDMS [3] catalogs use nm 2 MHz as units of intensity. In order to convert to HITRAN [1] units [cm- 1 /(molecule/cm 2) ], one has to divide the JPL intensity (not its logarithm) by a factor related to the speed of light, namely 2. 99792458 × 1018.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether patients with male factor infertility can be accurately identified by calculating a novel semen quality score and measuring levels of {{reactive oxygen species}} during routine infertility screening. METHODS: Semen samples from 133 patients and 91 healthy donors were evaluated with manual and computer-assisted semen analysis. A principal component analysis model was employed to calculate a semen quality score. In brief, this score was calculated by <b>base</b> <b>10</b> <b>logarithms</b> multiplied by varying weights given to 9 sperm parameters. Reactive oxygen species levels were measured using chemiluminescence assay. RESULTS: The semen quality score had a sensitivity of 80. 45 % and accuracy of 77 % at a cutoff of 93. 1 in identifying patients with male factor infertility. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the semen quality score was 84. 28 % (95 % CI: 65. 22 %- 100 %). Reactive oxygen species levels [log 10 (reactive oxygen species + 1) ] were significantly higher in male factor infertility patients. Reactive oxygen species had a sensitivity of 83. 47 % and specificity of 60. 52 % with an accuracy of 75 % at a cutoff of 1. 25 in identifying male factor infertility patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for reactive oxygen species levels was 78. 92 % (95 % CI: 72. 60 %- 85. 23 %). semen quality scores were significantly and negatively correlated with reactive oxygen species levels in the donors and the male factor infertility patients. CONCLUSIONS: The semen quality score and reactive oxygen species levels in semen samples appear to be strongly associated with male factor infertility.
