5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice, a patient has to be {{certified}} as having a prognosis of {{less than six months}} to live. Sometimes patients live longer. Medicare patients who receive the hospice <b>benefit</b> must waive other Medicare benefits that could prolong life. Under the Medicare provisions, the hospice <b>benefit</b> through the first six months is broken up into two 90-day <b>benefit</b> periods. At the end of these two <b>benefit</b> periods, the hospice team will evaluate whether or not the patient continues to have a prognosis of less than six months to live. Following these two 90-day <b>benefit</b> periods, the hospice is required to evaluate more closely and review the case every 60 days. Commercial insurers, managed care program providers, and Medicaid often have their own regulations regarding re-certification. When the hospice re-certifies a six-month or less prognosis, this is based on the patient's current condition.|$|E

40|$|The {{realization}} of <b>benefits</b> from IS/IT investments has consistently been reported {{as one of}} the major challenges of organizations. This paper reports on the findings from an exploratory field study on how <b>benefits</b> management success ultimately contributes to better IS/IT exploitation. A total of 34 semistructured interviews were held within 29 organizations. The study applies resource-based theory to examine the <b>benefits</b> management resources required and the process through which organizations translate such resources into <b>benefits</b> management competencies. The result is a framework offering items under three dimensions to outline how <b>benefits</b> management ultimately contributes to better IS/IT exploitation. The dimensions are: (1) <b>benefits</b> management resources, (2) <b>benefits</b> management capability and (3) contextual factors. The analysis finds that organizations develop <b>benefits</b> management capability in various stages: (1) <b>benefits</b> measurement competency, (2) <b>benefits</b> planning competency, and (3) <b>benefits</b> implementation competency. The results of our study also reveal that resources alone are not sufficient for successful <b>benefits</b> management.
