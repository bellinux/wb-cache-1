40|$|Among several Green house gases, CO 2 is a main {{contributor}} {{and accounts}} for about 60 % of the greenhouse effect because of its huge emission amount. The iron and steel sector has showed {{one of the largest}} energy intensity among manufacturing sectors. 31 % of CO 2 emission in the industrial sectors is caused by the production of iron and steel and the amount of CO 2 emission corresponds to nearly 6 - 10 % of global CO 2 emission. The potential of CCS in the industrial sectors is considered to be significant to mitigate CO 2 emission to the atmosphere. IEA has estimated that, in a scenario to halve global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2050 compared to 2007 level, nearly half of all CCS deployed (up to more than 10 Gt/yr) would be in industrial processes. In the study, the environmental performance of CCS deployment in blast furnace (<b>BF),</b> <b>top</b> gas recycling blast furnace (TGRBF) and COREX processes which are technologies for producing pig iron has been evaluated by Hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA). In terms of BF with a capture unit of chemical absorption by MEA solvent, expect for the GWP, other environmental impacts showed increases. As for TGRBF with PSA (pressure swing adsorption), while GWP and TAP decreased compared to TGRBF without CCS, the other environmental impacts were increased. COREX with physical absorption by Selexol solvent showed same trend with the BF+MEA. The net reduction of GWP was 26 % in the BF+MEA, 31 % in the TGRBF+PSA, and 48 % in the COREX+Selexol when performing CCS technologies into pig iron production in life cycle boundary. When it comes to the change range of the environmental impacts, the BF+MEA presented the higher increases on overall environmental impact categories except for GWP than other technologies with CCS. Regardless of CCS implementation, the COREX technology showed the highest benefits for most environmental impact factors aside from IRP and POFP. Overall, additional energy requirements by CO 2 capture unit in all technologies for pig iron production mainly contributed increases in terms of most environmental impacts. The impacts of transport and storage, and other materials such as solvent and sorbent production were negligible. This study has shown that hybrid LCA method is a helpful tool to support the discussion about environmental effects with respect to CCS technologies depended on different ironmaking technologies. </p...|$|E
5000|$|In the Desert War {{the arrival}} of the Kittyhawk led to the early {{retirement}} of the Bf 109E and its replacement by the faster and more maneuverable <b>Bf</b> 109F. The <b>top</b> scoring DAF squadrons, including No. 3 Squadron RAAF and No. 112 Squadron RAF, transferred from the Tomahawk to the Kittyhawk, scoring many kills against Luftwaffe and Regia Aeronautica types, helping the DAF to hold on through this tough period.|$|R
500|$|On 11 August 1940 Dundas flew R6769.

5|$|The German fighter escort {{consisted}} of five Gruppen from JG 3, JG 53 and Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77). LG 2 <b>Bf</b> 109s flew <b>top</b> cover while Adolf Galland's JG 26 and Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG 51) conducted fighter sweeps {{in advance of}} the main bomber stream. For the sake of appearances (the morale of the bomber crews), Zerstörergeschwader 26 (Destroyer Wing 26 or ZG 26) flying the Messerschmitt Bf 110 flew close escort to KG 26. It was twice as small as the formation that hit London on 7 September, but instead of having two fighters for every bomber, there were four. Nor could the German pilots complain about being tied to the bombers. Sufficient numbers of fighters were allowed to roam on free-ranging patrols.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the methodology and the preliminary {{results of a}} techno-economic assessment of CCS implementation on the iron and steel sector. The results show that for the short-mid term, a CO 2 avoidance cost of less than 50 €/tonne at a CO 2 avoidance rate of around 50 % are possible by converting the conventional blast furnace (<b>BF)</b> to <b>Top</b> Gas Recycling Blast Furnace (TGRBF). However, large additional power consumption for CO 2 removal and oxygen generation, and reduction in BF gas export, makes the economic performance of the technology very sensitive to energy prices. Add-on CO 2 capture for conventional BF may achieve similar costs (40 – 50 €/tCO 2 avoided), but the CO 2 avoidance rate will be only about 15 % of the specific CO 2 emissions. For the long term future, although there are large uncertainties, advanced CO 2 capture technologies {{do not seem to}} have significant economic advantages over conventional technologies. The results also indicate that in a carbon-constrained society, when considering new plants, smelting reduction technologies such as the COREX process, may become a strong competitor to conventional blast furnace based steel making process when equipped with CO 2 capture. Although conventional iron and steel making using BF is expected to dominate the market in the long term, strong need for drastic CO 2 emissions reduction may drive the sector towards large scale implementation of advanced smelting reduction technologies...|$|R
50|$|On 11 August 1940 Dundas flew R6769. Taking off at 09:45 am he led yellow section {{out to sea}} {{near the}} Isle of Wight at 24000 ft.

He shot down a Bf 110 but received hits from German rear gunners. The Bf 110 was likely from I./Zerstörergeschwader 2 ("destroyer wing 2").On 12 August the battle was repeated against Bf 109s and Bf 110s over the same area. Dundas shot down another Bf 110. Shaking off a Bf 109, he damaged another but was forced to disengage as more German fighters closed in and fuel and ammunition had run low. His fifth victory now made him a flying ace.|$|R
40|$|In {{professional}} road cyclists, {{the majority}} of overuse injuries affect the lower limbs and are mostly represented by contractures or muscle shortening, characterized by an increase of tone and stiffness and a variation of elasticity. Treatment and prevention of these specific conditions may include physical, supplementary, and pharmacologic support. The aim of this real-life study was to determine: first, the alterations of tone, stiffness, elasticity, and soreness of rectus femoris (RF) and biceps femoris (<b>BF)</b> in <b>top</b> class cyclists engaged in 3 multistage races, and second, whether any variable {{in the management of}} the athletes may affect the prevention and/or reduction of such alterations. Twenty-three professional cyclists competing in 3 international, cycling stage races were assessed. Athletes could receive, upon the approval of the medical staff, physical, dietary, and/or pharmacological management which could include treatments with topical over-the-counter myorelaxants to prevent and/or reduce muscle contractures. MyotonPro was used to daily measure tone, stiffness, and elasticity in RF and BF in relaxed and contracted state after every stage. In parallel, BF and RF soreness was also assessed with a Likert scale. All athletes received the same general massage management; none of them received dietary supplements; some of the athletes were treated with a topical myorelaxant thiocolchicoside (TCC 0. 25 %) foam 3 times daily. TCC was identified as the only variable able to affect these muscle parameters in the cyclists. Tone, stiffness (regardless of the state), and soreness significantly increased over time either in BF or RF in all athletes. In the group of athletes that used TCC (n =  11; TCC+) the increase in tone, stiffness, and soreness was significantly lower than in the group not receiving TCC (n =  12; No-TCC). Elasticity varied coherently with tone and stiffness. A very intense and protracted sport activity increases muscular tone, stiffness, and soreness over time. Topical TCC foam significantly attenuates these alterations and might represent an efficient strategy both to prevent and manage contractures and their consequences in professional cyclists as well in athletes from other disciplines involving similar workloads...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe steel {{industry}} is {{under pressure to}} reduce its CO 2 emissions, which arise {{from the use of}} coal. In the long-term, the injection of pulverized particles of charcoal from biomass through blast furnace tuyeres, in this case called Bio-PCI, is an attractive method from both an environmental and metallurgical viewpoint. The potential of Bio-PCI has been assessed in terms of its CO 2 abatement potential and economic viewpoint. A cost objective function has been used to measure the impact of biochar substitution in highly fuel-efficient <b>BF</b> among the <b>top</b> nine hot metal producers; estimations are based on the relevant cost determinants of ironmaking. This contribution aims to shed light on two strategic questions: Under what conditions is the implementation of Bio-PCI economically attractive? Additionally, where is such a techno-economic innovation likely to be taken up the earliest? The results indicate the potential for an 18 – 40 % mitigation of CO 2. Findings from the economic assessment show that biochar cannot compete with fossil coal on price alone; therefore, a lower cost of biochar or the introduction of carbon taxes will be necessary to increase the competitiveness of Bio-PCI. Based on the current prices of raw materials, electricity and carbon taxes, biochar should be between 130. 1 and 236. 4 USD/t and carbon taxes should be between 47. 1 and 198. 7 USD/t CO 2 to facilitate the substitution of Bio-PCI in the examined countries. In regard to implementation, Brazil, followed by India, China and the USA appeared to be {{in a better position to}} deploy Bio-PCI...|$|R
5000|$|After the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was {{defeated}} and {{occupied by the}} Axis powers, was created the new Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska, NDH).On 27 June, the Croatian Legion (Hrvatska Legija) was formed on order of Ante Pavelić, to support German forces on the Eastern Front. The air component, Hrvatska Zrakoplovna Legija (HZL, Croatian Air Force Legion), was established on 12 of July. Named 4.Mesovita Zrakoplovna Pukovnija (Mixed Air Force Regiment) [...] it comprised two units: a bomber and a fighter group. The latter, Zakroplovna Lovacka Skupina (ZLS), with 202 men, was sent to Germany and trained on Bf 109s. 10. Zrakoplovno Lovacko Jato (ZLJ, air force fighter squadron), equipped with 10 Bf 109F and one Bf 109E, was the first operative Croatian unit. Its first base was Poltava, in Ukraine, where it was subordinated to III./JG 52. There, 10.ZLS was renamed 15(Kroatische)./JG 52. The first air victories of Croatian aviation came on 2 November 1942. That day, Hauptmann Vladimir Ferencina (future 10 kills ace) and Leutnant Baumgarten claimed a Polikarpov I-16 Rata each, near Rostov. By {{the end of the}} war, 17 Croatian pilots had achieved the status of ace, flying the <b>Bf</b> 109, the <b>top</b> scoring being Mato Dukovac, with 44 kills. At the end of the conflict, 17 Luftwaffe and Croatian Air Force Bf 109s were found by Yugoslav Partisans on Yugoslav territory. These were stored until 1949 while more were acquired from Bulgaria. The new SFR Yugoslav Air Force used a mix of G-2, G-6, G-10 and G-12 aircraft until mid-1952 by 172nd Fighter Regiment.|$|R
40|$|Nine {{residential}} wood pellet boilers {{were tested}} for the emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), dust and combustion efficiency in real life and standard laboratory conditions and values were compared with the permissible values of Blue Angel, Swan Mark and EN- 303 - 5. The test setup consisted of six boilers equipped with bottom feed burner (<b>BF),</b> one with <b>top</b> feed (TF) and two with horizontally feed burner (HF). Wood pellets used as fuel were DINplus certified. In real life conditions, 20 Â kW bottom feed boiler had the best performance. Emissions of dust from bottom and horizontal feed boilers were better in real life conditions than in standard laboratory conditions. All boiler technologies had lower combustion efficiencies in real life condition (2 - 5 % less) than in standard laboratory condition. Top feed boiler emitted maximum CO (1566 Â mgÂ NÂ m- 3); and dust particles from concerned boiler contained {{a considerable amount of}} elemental carbon. Almost similar NOx emissions were reported with all technologies in real life conditions. All the boilers met emissions and efficiency requirements of Swan Mark (except top feed boilers for CO) and EN- 303 - 5, in both conditions. In laboratory conditions, all bottom feed boilers satisfied emissions and efficiency requirements of Blue Angel, however, in real life situation only 20 Â kW bottom feed and horizontal feed boilers could meet the concerned requirements. Bottom and horizontal feed boiler technologies have advantage over top feed, having lower emissions and higher efficiency. Keeping in mind minor variation in quality of considered wood pellets, different burner configurations clearly lead to important differences in the emissions and efficiencies.
