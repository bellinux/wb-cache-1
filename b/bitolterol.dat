50|$|<b>Bitolterol</b> mesylate (Tornalate) is a short-acting β2 {{adrenergic}} receptor agonist {{used for the}} relief of bronchospasm in conditions such as asthma and COPD. In these disorders there is a narrowing of the airways (bronchi and their ramifications) that carry air to the lungs. Muscle spasm and inflammation within the bronchi get worse this narrowing. <b>Bitolterol</b> relaxes the smooth muscles present continuously around the bronchi and bronchioles facilitating the flow of air through them.|$|E

40|$|The hypoxic {{effects of}} {{salbutamol}} 200 micrograms (CAS 18559 - 94 - 9) and <b>bitolterol</b> mesilate 740 micrograms (Biterol, CAS 30392 - 41 - 7), both administered by pressurized aerosol, were assessed by transcutaneous pO 2 monitoring in 18 asthmatic subjects and in 12 normal volunteers. Unlike the latter, the asthmatics showed a highly {{significant difference in}} ptcO 2 time course after the two drugs. After <b>bitolterol</b> mesylate the decrease in ptcO 2 was much more gradual and the maximal decrease showed a 10 -min time lag vs. salbutamol, which may partly explain the well known chronotropic effect of <b>bitolterol.</b> The clinical importance of the beta 2 -induced hypoxemia may be related more to {{the dynamics of the}} ptcO 2 decrease than to its absolute magnitude, which is usually fairly moderate...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} and disposition of <b>bitolterol.</b> the di-p-toluate ester of N-t-butylarterenol (tBA) was studied in man after a single oral dose and in dog after intraduodenal, iv. or oral administration. The mean (± SE) peak plasma radioactivity in man (dose. 70 pg/kg) was 180 ± 1 8 ng equivalents of (3 H Ibitolterol per ml or approximately 1 1 % of the dose. whereas peak plasma radioactivity in dog (dose. 200 pg/kg) was 144 ± 23 ng equivalents per ml or approximately 4 % of the dose. For both man and dog. {{the time for}} maximum plasma level of radioactivity varied from 0. 5 to 2 hr. In man, only 1 % of the plasma radioactivity represented intact l 3 Hlbitolterol 1. 0 hr after medication. In the dog. radioactivity was concentrated in lung tissue after iv administration of l 3 Hlbitolterol. Recovery of intact l 3 Hlbitolterol in lung at 4. 5 hr ranged from 26 to 46 % of total tissue rad) oactivity after iv dosage and from 4 to 1 4 % total tissue radioactivity after intraduodenal administration. Radioactivity recovered in human urine and feces (0 - 72 hr) accounted for 86 and 8. 1 % of the dose, respectively. Recovery of radioactivity in dog urine and feces accounted for 58 and 23 % of the dose. respectively. {{in the same time}} period. Radiochromatograms of urine samples from man and dog revealed similar patterns of metabolite...|$|E
40|$|Background: Theophylline {{and long}} acting beta- 2 {{agonists}} are bronchodilators {{used for the}} management of persistent asthma symptoms, especially nocturnal asthma. They represent different classes of drug with differing side-effect profiles. Objectives: To assess the comparative efficacy, safety and side-effects of long-acting beta- 2 agonists and theophylline in the maintenance treatment of adults and adolescents with asthma. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and reference lists of articles. We also contacted authors of identified RCTs for other relevant published and unpublished studies and pharmaceutical manufacturers. Most recent search: November 2007. Selection criteria: All included studies were RCTs involving adults and children with clinical evidence of asthma. These studies must have compared oral sustained release and/or dose adjusted theophylline with an inhaled long-acting beta- 2 agonist. Data collection and analysis: In original review, two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, similarly in this update two reviewers undertook this. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Main results: Thirteen studies with a total of 1344 participants met the inclusion criteria of the review. They were of varying quality. There {{was no significant difference between}} salmeterol and theophylline in FEV 1 predicted (6. 5 %; 95 % CI - 0. 84 to 13. 83). However, salmeterol treatment led to significantly better morning PEF (mean difference 16. 71 L/min, 95 % CI 8. 91 to 24. 51) and evening PEF (mean difference 15. 58 L/min, 95 % CI 8. 33 to 22. 83). Salmeterol also reduced the use of rescue medication. Formoterol, used in two studies was reported to be as effective as theophylline. <b>Bitolterol,</b> used in only one study, was reported to be less effective than theophylline. Participants taking salmeterol experienced fewer adverse events than those using theophylline (Parallel studies: Relative Risk 0. 44; 95 % CI 0. 30 to 0. 63, Risk Difference - 0. 11; 95 % CI - 0. 16 to - 0. 07, Numbers Needed to Treat (NNT) 9; 95 % CI 6 to 14). Significant reductions were reported for central nervous system adverse events (Relative Risk 0. 50; 95 % CI 0. 29 to 0. 86, Risk Difference - 0. 07; 95 % CI - 0. 12 to - 0. 02, NNT 14; 95 % CI 8 to 50) and gastrointestinal adverse events (Relative Risk 0. 30; 95 % CI 0. 17 to 0. 55, Risk Difference - 0. 11; 95 % CI - 0. 16 to - 0. 06, NNT 9; 95 % CI 6 to 16). Authors' conclusions: Long-acting beta- 2 agonists, particularly salmeterol, are more effective than theophylline in improving morning and evening PEF, but are not significantly different in their effect on FEV 1. There is evidence of decreased daytime and nighttime short-acting beta- 2 agonist requirement with salmeterol. Fewer adverse events occurred in participants using long-acting beta- 2 agonists (salmeterol and formoterol) as compared to theophylline...|$|E
