5|$|In 1746 Thomas Bilbie, from Chew Stoke in Somerset, {{created a}} new <b>bell</b> <b>foundry</b> (The West of England Church Bellfoundry) in the town, paying an annual rent of £1/13/4 (£1.67) for {{premises}} in the Almshouse building. He recast the six bells of Cullompton church as eight new ones. In 1754 Thomas's eldest son also called Thomas moved to Cullompton {{to take over the}} <b>bell</b> <b>foundry.</b> Over a period of 26 years he cast 239 bells, the majority for churches in Devon. When he died, aged 53 in 1780, his son Thomas Castleman Bilbie took over the business and cast 197 bells from 1780 to 1813. The business was then sold to Pannell and Co. who moved it to Exeter in 1850.|$|E

5|$|Liberty Bell {{refers to}} one of two replicas in Portland, Oregon, United States, of the {{original}} Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. The first replica was purchased in 1962, and installed in the rotunda of City Hall in 1964. On November 21, 1970, it was destroyed in a bomb blast that also damaged the building's east portico. The second replica was installed outside of City Hall soon after the blast (c. 1972) with funds from private donations. It was constructed at the McShane <b>Bell</b> <b>Foundry</b> in Baltimore and dedicated on November 6, 1975. The bell is listed as a state veterans memorial by the Oregon Department of Veterans' Affairs.|$|E
5|$|The Whitechapel <b>Bell</b> <b>Foundry,</b> a {{principal}} supplier of church bells in Britain, {{is based at}} No.32–34 Whitechapel Road. The buildings date from 1670 and are Grade II listed. Originally a coaching inn known as the Artichoke, it has been occupied by the foundry since 1738, replacing smaller premises {{on the north side}} of the road. Davenant Foundation School moved to No.173 Whitechapel Road in 1818. The school expanded with a new hall and classrooms in 1896, with further improvements in 1909. However, a decreasing child population meant that in 1965, the school moved to Loughton, Essex. The building remains on the north side and is Grade II listed.|$|E
5|$|The tower has {{numerous}} put-log holes, and {{is supported}} on four massive columns and surmounted by a nineteenth century low octagonal broached short slated recessed slated spire with fish-scale slates and weathercock. There are nineteenth century louvred paired cusped bell-lights and a corbelled embattled parapet. The tower contains a fine peal of bells, with {{the oldest of}} the original set of six being cast in 1749 by Rudhall <b>bell</b> <b>foundry.</b> Two were added in 1886, when the bell chamber was renovated. Two more were added to mark the new millennium in 2000, when some of the others were recast or tuned. The work was completed by Spring 2001. The tower presents one of the more noticeable views in Aberystwyth. It also contains a south side clock dated 1859.|$|E
50|$|The {{tower of}} the present Holy Trinity parish church has a ring of four bells. Edward Newcombe, who had <b>bell</b> <b>foundries</b> at Leicester and Bedford, cast the treble and second bell for the {{original}} parish church in 1595. Richard I Purdue, who had bellfoundries in Somerset at Glastonbury and Stoford, cast the third bell in 1624. John Briant of Hertford cast the tenor bell in 1803, five years after St Thomas' church was built.|$|R
50|$|The next {{tower to}} be {{converted}} was Santissima Trinità in 1803. Next Chievo (1808) and then later the Cathedral, Santi Apostoli, Santo Stefano, San Salvatore Corte Regia and Santa Anastasia. The ringers at Santa Anastasia were a group {{who worked on the}} floating mills on the river Adige, behind the apse of the basilica. This demand for new bells led to four <b>bell</b> <b>foundries,</b> managed by the students of Ruffini: Partilora-Selegari, Chiappani and son, and the two Cavadini companies.|$|R
50|$|It has few notable public buildings, but {{possesses}} three {{churches and}} monuments to the Dobermann Pinscher dog breed, {{which was created}} in Apolda, and to Christian Zimmermann (1759-1842), who, by introducing the hosiery and cloth manufacture, made Apolda {{one of the most}} important places in Germany in these branches of industry. It has also had extensive dyeworks, <b>bell</b> <b>foundries,</b> and manufactures of steam engines, boilers, cars and bicycles. After German reunification the majority of these had to be closed down for economical reasons.|$|R
5|$|A leat runs to {{the east}} of the town's main street but it is {{uncertain}} when it was first constructed. By the early seventeenth century, {{the southern end of the}} leat and one mill are shown on a map. There were three main mills: Higher Mill, Lower Mill and Middle Mill. Higher Mill appears to have always been a corn mill and it continued to produce animal feed until 1974. It has since been converted to housing but a water turbine remains. Middle Mill was used as a woollen mill in the nineteenth century and was also associated with Bilbie's <b>bell</b> <b>foundry</b> (see below). Around 1900, the mill was steam powered and had a boiler delivered. It is labelled as an axle works on the 1904 Second Edition Ordnance Survey map. The only remains of Middle Mill are some walls and a chimney base. Lower Mill ceased working in 1968. The building is now in residential use but the sluices (made by Stenner and Gunn of the Lowman Ironworks, Tiverton) can still be seen, as can the water wheel and gearing.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{widening}} {{of the tower}} arches in 1270 and 1320 the tower of St.Mary's had been structurally weak. The subsequent addition of the bells and belfry and the lead-covered spire added to {{the weight of the}} tower, and the number of burials of local notables within the church and of parishioners immediately outside the church building weakened the structure further. By the 18th century the problems had become severe enough that the west arch of the south transept was blocked up in an effort the strengthen the structure, and a hollow pillar which housed the stairway to the rood loft was filled in. The tower continued to weaken, a situation made worse by the addition in 1812 of a new ring of six bells with a 17cwt(860kg) tenor bell, cast by Thomas Mears II of the Whitechapel <b>Bell</b> <b>Foundry.</b> Iron bands were wrapped around the tower to strengthen it but these soon snapped, and by the 19th century large cracks, which had appeared in the tower, were filled with broken bricks and rubble and covered over with roughcast as an interim solution.|$|E
5|$|The {{stained glass}} in the east window, dated 1856, was made by William Wailes. The glass in a south window in the chancel of 1909 was made by Morris & Co. The east window in the north aisle, dated 1920 is by Irene Dunlop. The stained glass window {{to the left of}} the pulpit was donated by the Greg family of Styal Mill. The stained {{glass in the}} window at the west end of the north aisle is to the memory of the wife of Edward John Bell, rector from 1870 to 1907, and was made by Clayton and Bell in 1877. The tower holds a ring of six bells, hung for change ringing, five of which were cast in 1787 by Rudhall of Gloucester, and the sixth by Charles and George Mears at the Whitechapel <b>Bell</b> <b>Foundry</b> in 1847. A seventh, unused, bell dates from 1686 and has been noted as being of {{historical}} importance by the Church Buildings Council of the Church of England. The parish registers begin in 1629, and the churchwardens' accounts in 1612.|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis examines bell {{founding in}} Bohemia in the Middle Ages and the Early Modern period of modern history, primarily from an archaeological viewpoint. The archaeological {{part of the}} bachelor thesis, which {{is central to the}} whole paper, relies on findings of works on both moveable and immoveable archaeological evidence of bell founding from several regions of Bohemia. The goal of the bachelor thesis is to introduce a new picture of bell founding from various perspectives. The paper comprises not only an archaeological point of view, which focuses on archaeological finds of bells and bell fragments and archaeological evidence from <b>bell</b> <b>foundries,</b> but also a campanological and historical point of view, presenting the current state of research in the field. In terms of methodology, the bachelor thesis uses description, transcription, induction, deduction, analysis, synthesis, and a synchronous approach to the matter. Attached are: sketches and photography of archaeological finds, sketches and photography of immovable archaeological finds, tabular summaries and graphs...|$|R
