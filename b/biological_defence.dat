50|$|The {{origins of}} the HPA's largest {{facility}} in Porton Down {{can be traced back}} to 1940, when Porton had a highly secret and independent 'Biology Department' under the Ministry of Defence to study biological warfare and defence against it. It was called the 'Microbiological Research Department' (by 1946), and subsequently the 'Microbiological Research Establishment' (from 1951) with research becoming increasingly defensive and civilian in nature. Total civilian control was established by moving <b>biological</b> <b>defence</b> work to the Chemical Defence Establishment (now dstl), and renaming the facility from 1 April 1979 as the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research (CAMR) within the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS). In April 1994, CAMR moved from PHLS centre to the Microbiological Research Authority (MRA), reporting to the Department of Health and still continuing the programme in civil microbiological research started in 1979.|$|E
5000|$|Starting {{out as the}} Experimental Station Suffield in 1941 (as a {{replacement}} for the French/British experimental station at Beni Ounif in Algeria that had fallen to Axis powers in 1940), it was taken under the wing of the Defence Research Board [...] in 1947, then renamed in 1967 to Defence Research Establishment - Suffield (DRES). Meanwhile, CFB Suffield was formally established as a co-located army base in 1971, largely to take over support operations for DRES activities. Finally, as the Defence Research Board evolved to become the Research and Development Branch in 1974 and Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) in 2000, the establishment at Suffield became known as DRDC Suffield, {{one of a handful}} of defence research establishments in the country under the authority of the Assistant Deputy Minister - Science and Technology of the Department of National Defence.

40|$|Cellular immune defences in {{sea urchins}} are shared amongst the coelomocytes - a {{heterogeneous}} population of cells {{residing in the}} coelomic fluid (blood equivalent) and tissues. The most iconic coelomocyte morphotype is the red spherule cell (or amebocyte), so named due to the abundance of cytoplasmic vesicles containing the naphthoquinone pigment echinochrome A. Despite their identification over a century ago, and evidence of antiseptic properties, little {{progress has been made}} in characterising the immunocompetence of these cells. Upon exposure of red spherule cells from sea urchins, i. e., Paracentrotus lividus and Psammechinus miliaris, to microbial ligands, intact microbes, and damage signals, we observed cellular degranulation and increased detection of cell-free echinochrome in the coelomic fluid ex vivo. Treatment of the cells with ionomycin, a calcium-specific ionophore, confirmed that an increase in intracellular levels of Ca 2 + is a trigger of echinochrome release. Incubating Gram-positive/negative bacteria as well as yeast with lysates of red spherule cells led to significant reductions in colony-forming units. Such antimicrobial properties were counteracted by the addition of ferric iron (Fe 3 +), suggesting that echinochrome acts as a primitive iron chelator in echinoid <b>biological</b> <b>defences...</b>|$|R
