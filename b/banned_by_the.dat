5|$|Authors {{of books}} {{left the country}} in droves and some wrote {{material}} critical of the regime while in exile. Goebbels recommended that the remaining authors concentrate on books themed on Germanic myths {{and the concept of}} blood and soil.

5|$|Busch drew on {{contemporary}} parochial and city life, satirizing Catholicism, Philistinism, strict religious morality and bigotry.

5|$|In 1996, Favre was {{temporarily}} <b>banned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> NFL from drinking alcohol after he admitted he {{was addicted to}} Vicodin and spent 46 days at a drug rehab clinic {{before the start of}} the season.

5|$|After bee populations dropped 23% in {{the winter}} of 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Agriculture formed a task force to address the issue. In the six years leading up to 2013, more than 10 million {{beehives}} were lost, often to CCD, nearly twice the normal rate of loss. However, according to Syngenta and the F.A.O., the total number of beehives worldwide continues to grow. An insecticide produced by Syngenta was <b>banned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> European Commission in 2013 for use in crops pollinated by bees. Syngenta together with Bayer is challenging this ban in court.|$|E

5|$|By 1975, {{peregrine}} falcons {{had been}} reduced to 324 pairs in North America, primarily as a result of DDT, a widely used pesticide. DDT lowered estrogen levels in female peregrines and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to thin and break during incubation. Recovery efforts for the peregrine falcon have been remarkably successful: agricultural DDT was <b>banned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> U.S. in 1972 and efforts to breed and train peregrine falcons in captivity to later release to the wild were effective. In 1999, the peregrine falcon was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E
5|$|From October 1988 to September 1994 {{the voices}} of representatives from Sinn Féin and several Irish republican and loyalist groups were <b>banned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British {{government}} from being broadcast on television and radio in the United Kingdom. The restrictions, announced by the Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, on 19 October 1988, covered eleven organisations based in Northern Ireland and followed a heightened period {{of violence in the}} history of the Troubles, as well as the government's belief in a need to prevent Sinn Féin from using the media for political advantage.|$|E
5|$|In response, {{steps were}} taken to better protect the tankers from attack, but losses {{continued}} to mount until, in April 1942, they were <b>banned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Navy from operating the north-east sea routes. The government and industry took steps to maximise {{the use of the}} railroads, increasing the amount of oil carried on them more than ten-fold, but there were shortages of rail tank cars, and the existing fleet of cars was in poor condition. Instead, the United States government began to examine options for the use of pipelines to fulfil the demand for petroleum in the north-east.|$|E
50|$|In December 2010, Turdiu brutally {{assaulted}} Albanian Superliga referee Laver Alla, {{outside a}} bar near Tirana International Airport. He faced a lifetime <b>ban</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> FSHF as the player had {{a string of}} offences and bans, including an 8 match ban following a mass brawl during the Albanian Superliga 2010 Playoff finals. He received a 4-year <b>ban</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> FSHF but following an appeal <b>by</b> <b>the</b> player and his club Kastrioti Krujë, the ban was lifted after just 8 months meaning Turdiu was eligible {{to play at the}} start of the 2011-12 campaign.|$|R

5|$|On 25 August 2013, Rambhadracharya {{arrived at}} the Chaudhary Charan Singh Airport in Lucknow along with VHP leader Ashok Singhal. He was going to Ayodhya {{to take part in}} the 84-kosi yatra, a 12-day {{religious}} yatra which was <b>banned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> state government citing law and order reasons. It is alleged that the ban was due to opposition from Muslim organisations or vote-bank politics. Rambhadracharya's participation in the yatra was kept secret. Rambhadracharya was put under house arrest at the home of R C Mishra, his disciple and friend.|$|E
5|$|Steel drums are a distinctively Trinidadian {{ensemble}} {{that evolved}} from improvised percussion instruments used in Carnival processions. By the late 1930s, bamboo tubes, a traditional instrumental, were supplemented by {{pieces of metal}} used percussively; over time, these metal percussion instruments were pitched to produce as many as twenty-some tones. Steel bands were large orchestras of these drums, and were <b>banned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British colonial authorities. Nevertheless, steel drums spread across the Caribbean, and are now an entrenched {{part of the culture}} of Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
5|$|The Jewish {{community}} in England continued to provide essential money-lending and banking services that were otherwise <b>banned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> usury laws, and {{grew in the}} 12th century by Jewish immigrants fleeing the fighting around Rouen. The Jewish community spread beyond London to eleven major English cities, primarily the major trading hubs in the east of England with functioning mints, all with suitable castles for protection of the often persecuted Jewish minority. By {{the time of the}} Anarchy and the reign of Stephen, the communities were flourishing and providing financial loans to the king.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1913, {{the party}} {{established}} contact with prominent revolutionaries in India, including Rash Behari Bose. An Indian edition of the Hindustan Ghadar essentially espoused the philosophies of anarchism and revolutionary terrorism against British interests in India. Political discontent and violence mounted in Punjab, and Ghadarite publications that reached Bombay from California were deemed seditious and <b>banned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Raj. These events, compounded by evidence of prior Ghadarite incitement in the Delhi-Lahore Conspiracy of 1912, led the British government to pressure the American State Department to suppress Indian revolutionary activities and Ghadarite literature, which emanated mostly from San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|While Mugabe was {{teaching}} abroad, an anti-colonialist African nationalist movement {{was established in}} Southern Rhodesia. This was first led by Joshua Nkomo's Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, founded in September 1957 and then <b>banned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> colonial government in February 1959. This {{was replaced by the}} more radically oriented National Democratic Party (NDP), founded in January 1960. In May 1960, Mugabe returned to Southern Rhodesia, bringing Hayfron with him. The pair had planned for their visit to be short, however Mugabe's friend, the African nationalist Leopold Takawira, urged them to stay.|$|E
5|$|Women's {{football}} was long met with skepticism in Germany, and official matches were <b>banned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> DFB until 1970.
