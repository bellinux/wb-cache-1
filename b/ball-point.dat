5|$|She, Charlie (Kirk Acevedo), and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) {{are called}} {{to the scene of}} an {{accident}} where a pedestrian has been run over by a bus, nearly duplicating events of a similar bus accident the day before, a statistical impossibility according to Astrid (Jasika Nicole). Olivia finds a <b>ball-point</b> pen at the scene, a rarity in the parallel universe because of the adoption of digital interfaces. Evidence suggests that the discovery of the pen by a bystander created a sequence of reactions that led to the victim's death. The next day, another pedestrian is wounded in a bus accident. As the Fringe team investigates the scene, finding another pen, a bystander is struck and killed by an ambulance. Olivia spots a suspicious man in the crowds, but he uses a seemingly random series of happenstance events to get away.|$|E
25|$|Notable Zagreb souvenirs are the tie or cravat, an {{accessory}} named after Croats who wore characteristic scarves {{around their necks}} in the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century and the <b>ball-point</b> pen, a tool developed from the inventions by Slavoljub Eduard Penkala, an inventor and a citizen of Zagreb.|$|E

25|$|The Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA) is a {{combination}} of a high-temperature furnace with a mass spectrometer. It was used to bake samples of Martian dust and determine its content. It has eight ovens, each {{about the size of a}} large <b>ball-point</b> pen, which were able to analyze one sample each, for a total of eight separate samples. Team members measured how much water vapor and carbon dioxide gas were given off, how much water ice the samples contained, and what minerals are present that may have formed during a wetter, warmer past climate. The instrument also measured organic volatiles, such as methane, down to 10 ppb. TEGA was built by the University of Arizona and University of Texas at Dallas.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the primary}} graphic {{distinction}} made in classifications {{is that of}} linearity. Linear writing systems are those in which the characters are composed of lines, such as the Latin alphabet and Chinese characters. Chinese characters are considered linear whether they are written with a <b>ball-point</b> pen or a calligraphic brush, or cast in bronze. Similarly, Egyptian hieroglyphs and Maya glyphs were often painted in linear outline form, but in formal contexts they were carved in bas-relief. The earliest examples of writing are linear: the Sumerian script of c. 3300 BC was linear, though its cuneiform descendants were not. Non-linear systems, on the other hand, such as braille, are not composed of lines, no matter what instrument is used to write them.|$|E
2500|$|Tumors induce {{blood vessel}} growth (angiogenesis) by {{secreting}} various growth factors (e.g. [...] VEGF). Growth {{factors such as}} bFGF and VEGF can induce capillary growth into the tumor, which some researchers suspect supply required nutrients, allowing for tumor expansion. Unlike normal blood vessels, tumor blood vessels are dilated with an irregular shape. [...] In 2007, {{it was discovered that}} cancerous cells stop producing the anti-VEGF enzyme PKG. [...] In normal cells (but not in cancerous ones), PKG apparently limits beta-catenin, which solicits angiogenesis. Other clinicians believe angiogenesis really serves as a waste pathway, taking away the biological end products secreted by rapidly dividing cancer cells. In either case, angiogenesis is a necessary and required step for transition from a small harmless cluster of cells, often said to be {{about the size of the}} metal ball at the end of a <b>ball-point</b> pen, to a large tumor. Angiogenesis is also required for the spread of a tumor, or metastasis. Single cancer cells can break away from an established solid tumor, enter the blood vessel, and be carried to a distant site, where they can implant and begin the growth of a secondary tumor. Evidence now suggests the blood vessel in a given solid tumor may, in fact, be mosaic vessels, composed of endothelial cells and tumor cells. This mosaicity allows for substantial shedding of tumor cells into the vasculature, possibly contributing to the appearance of circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood of patients with malignancies. The subsequent growth of such metastases will also require a supply of nutrients and oxygen and a waste disposal pathway.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ball-point</b> plotter pens with refillable {{clear plastic}} ink {{reservoirs}} are available. They {{do not have}} the fading or wear effects of fiber pens, but are generally more expensive and uncommon. Also, conventional <b>ball-point</b> pens can be modified to work in most pen plotters.|$|E

50|$|When {{the sheets}} are written on with {{pressure}} (e.g., <b>ball-point</b> pen) or impact (e.g., typewriter, dot-matrix printer), the pressure causes the micro-capsules to break and release their dye. Since the capsules are so small, the resulting print is very accurate.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, Nagamoto {{started a}} new {{technique}} for his compositions; the use of <b>ball-point</b> pen and parchment. This style of art gained him critical success when he was featured on Bravo television in Star Portraits for his portrait of Canadian actor and icon Gordon Pinsent.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, {{fountain}} pens retained their dominance: early ballpoint pens were expensive, were prone to leaks and had irregular inkflow, while the fountain pen continued {{to benefit from}} the combination of mass production and craftsmanship.(Bíró's patent, and other early patents on <b>ball-point</b> pens often used the term [...] "ball-point fountain pen," [...] because at the time the <b>ball-point</b> pen was considered a type of fountain pen; that is, a pen that held ink in an enclosed reservoir.)This period saw the launch of innovative models such as the Parker 51, the Aurora 88, the Sheaffer Snorkel, and the Eversharp Skyline and (later) Skyliner, while the Esterbrook J series of lever-fill models with interchangeable steel nibs offered inexpensive reliability to the masses.|$|E
50|$|Crystal violet is {{not used}} as a textile dye. Instead, {{it is used to}} dye paper and as a {{component}} of navy blue and black inks for printing, <b>ball-point</b> pens, and inkjet printers. It is also used to colourize diverse products such as fertilizers, antifreezes, detergents, and leather.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, an {{employee}} (Helen Diserens) developed an applicator {{based on the}} newly invented <b>ball-point</b> pen. In 1952, the company began marketing the product under the name Ban Roll-On. In 1958, the product was launched in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Nations as Mum Rollette.|$|E

50|$|During WW II, {{workers at}} the Baldwin Locomotive Works which was {{producing}} tanks for the US Army at that time, were using Nissen textile markers to mark the steel plates. The company decided to produce <b>ball-point</b> Metal Markers to better fulfill this need. Both Textile Markers and the Metal Markers are still used by J.P. Nissen Company today.|$|E
50|$|A common urban legend states that, {{faced with}} the fact that <b>ball-point</b> pens would not write in zero-gravity, NASA spent a large amount of money to develop a pen that would write in the {{conditions}} experienced during spaceflight (the result purportedly being the Fisher Space Pen), while the Soviet Union took the simpler and cheaper route of just using pencils. The Fisher Space Pen was actually developed independently and privately in the 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|Shizu Saldamando (born 1978 in San Francisco, CA), is an American visual artist. Her work merges {{painting}} and collage (often using origami paper) in portraits that often deal with social constructs {{of identity and}} subcultures.

[...] Saldamando also works in video, installation and performance art.|$|E
50|$|Circuit Scribe is a <b>ball-point</b> pen {{containing}} silver {{conductive ink}} {{that can be}} used to draw circuits instantly on flexible substrates like paper. Circuit Scribe made its way onto Kickstarter (an online site where people can fund projects) on November 19, 2013 with its goal of raising $85,000 for the manufacturing of the first batch of pens. By December 31, 2013, Circuit Scribe was able to raise a total of $674,425 with 12,277 'backers' or donors.|$|E
50|$|Another approach, e.g. Computervision's Interact I, {{involved}} attaching <b>ball-point</b> pens to drafting pantographs {{and driving}} the machines with stepper motors {{controlled by the}} computer. This had the disadvantage of being somewhat slow to move, as well as requiring floor space equal {{to the size of}} the paper, but could double as a digitizer. A later change was the addition of an electrically controlled clamp to hold the pens, which allowed them to be changed, and thus create multi-colored output.|$|E
50|$|The {{panel is}} Dürer's second {{treatment}} of Lucretia, following {{a very similar}} 1508 drawing. Art historians tend not to view {{it as one of}} his best paintings, and it is often compared, unfavourably, to a similar work by Lucas Cranach the Elder. However, art historians see the Dürer as a less formal treatment, more inward and concerned with confronting death and dying. Between 1959-60, Alberto Giacometti completed a Sketch after Durer's Lucretia using <b>ball-point</b> pen on paper.|$|E

[...] Now 84, Matisse died on November 3, 1954. The day before, when she came to his sickbed, Matisse made a last drawing - it was of her, using a <b>ball-point</b> pen.|$|E
50|$|David Gestetner {{eventually}} {{moved to}} London, England and in 1881 established the Gestetner Cyclograph Company to produce stencils, styli and ink rollers. He guarded his invention through patents. He also invented other notable {{devices such as}} the nail-clipper and a type of <b>ball-point</b> pen. The Gestetner works opened in 1906 at Tottenham Hale, north London, and employed several thousand people until the 1970s. His invention became an overnight international success, and he soon established an international chain of branches that sold and serviced his products.|$|E
50|$|Ball {{burnishing}} {{tools of}} another type are sometimes used in CNC milling centres {{to follow a}} ball-nosed milling operation: the hardened ball is applied along a zig-zag toolpath in a holder similar to a <b>ball-point</b> pen, except that the 'ink' is pressurised, recycled lubricant. This combines the productivity of a machined finish {{which is achieved by}} a 'semi-finishing' cut, with a better finish than obtainable with slow and time-consuming finish cuts. The feedrate for burnishing is that associated with 'rapid traverse' rather than finish machining.|$|E

50|$|Body {{was also}} an active art photographer, though untrained, whose {{unconventional}} work {{has been shown in}} several New Zealand galleries. The Male Nude Series (1983) featured male nudes in vibrant colours, created through manipulations of the film negatives. Using a scalpel, nail-file, felt-tip pen and even <b>ball-point</b> pen, Body worked the images by scratching and re-colouring to evoke a painterly quality. The audio-visual installation Runes (1984), commissioned by the Wellington Art Gallery, juxtaposed re-coloured photographs of graffiti in public toilets with recordings made in toilets of running water.|$|E
50|$|Ballpoint pens require {{little or}} no preparation. The immediacy allowed by ballpoints makes the pens ideal for quick sketches, {{convenient}} while traveling, and appealing to artists for whom sudden creative urges cannot be side-tracked by logistics or lengthy preparation time.For artists whose interests necessitate precision line-work, ballpoints are an obvious attraction; ballpoint pens allow for sharp lines not as effectively executed using a brush.Aside from standard <b>ball-point</b> sizes of fine or medium, the points of some pens are manufactured at multiple point-sizes—some in series with point-sizes ranging from 0.5 to 1.6mm—allowing for broader applications.|$|E
5000|$|The naturalization process {{starts with}} a written application. Applicants must submit three copies, written with a <b>ball-point</b> or {{fountain}} pen, to national authorities, and to provincial authorities in the Ministry of Public Security and the Public Security Bureau. Applicants must also submit original copies of a foreign passport, a residence permit, a permanent residence permit, and four two-and-a-half inch long pictures. According to the conditions outlined in the Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China, authorities may also require [...] "any other material that the authority believes {{are related to the}} nationality application".|$|E
50|$|It {{was built}} in {{classical}} orthodox style. An image of Saint Dionysius adorns the entrance. Inside, {{in addition to the}} usual sumptuous decor of an Orthodox church, there are some special features. It is striking that many chairs, standing consoles and other items are decorated with marquetry. The inserts are made of ivory or mother-of-pearl. On a small table stands an icon depicting the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Next to it is a little basket with notes and <b>ball-point</b> pens. Believers who want to make a request to the saint can put it here on paper.|$|E
50|$|The paper rolls were 120 ft long. A {{metal bar}} above the take-up reel allowed a {{finished}} plot {{to be torn}} off and removed. The drum would then be advanced using the manual controls and the fresh paper end taped to the take-up reel. The standard pen was a <b>ball-point,</b> but liquid ink pens were available, and typically used for higher quality plots intended for publication. Other paper stock could be taped to the drum if desired. A chart drive switch was provided {{to turn off the}} motorized paper supply and take-up reels for this purpose.|$|E
