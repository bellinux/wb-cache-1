25|$|The {{effect of}} the 1974–85 period's {{industrialization}} on the balance of trade was significant. The balance of trade moved from an average deficit of US$3.4billion in the 1974–76 period to an average surplus of US$10.7billion in the 1983–85 period. In 1985 the share of manufactures (processed and semi-processed) of total exports reached 66 percent, and between 1971–75 and 1978–83 the share of <b>basic</b> <b>input</b> imports in total imports declined from 32.3% to 19.2%.

However, import substitution was also important, as demonstrated by the few years of the 1980s that experienced a significant growth in GDP while the trade surplus was maintained.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} productivity growth, technical progress, {{and efficiency}} {{change in a}} sample of 34 Spanish university libraries between 2003 and 2007. Data envelopment analysis and a Malmquist index are combined with a bootstrap method to provide statistical inference estimators of individual productivity, technical progress, pure efficiency, and scale efficiency scores. To calculate productivity, a three-stage service model has been developed, examining productivity changes in the relationships between the libraries' <b>basic</b> <b>inputs,</b> intermediate outputs, and final outputs. The results indicate a growth in the productivity of the libraries (relationship between <b>basic</b> <b>inputs</b> and intermediate outputs) and in the productivity of the service (relationship between <b>basic</b> <b>inputs</b> and final outputs). The growth in productivity in both relationships is due to technical progress. If the variable representing the use of electronic information resources is removed from the final output, the result is a significant reduction in productivity.

40|$|We {{study the}} prices paid for <b>basic</b> <b>inputs</b> during a {{crackdown}} on corruption in the public hospitals {{of the city of}} Buenos Aires, Argentina during 1996 - 97. As in previous, informal accounts of corruption-crackdowns, there is a well defined, negative effect on the measures used to capture corruption. Prices paid by hospitals for <b>basic</b> <b>inputs</b> fall by 18 % during {{the first six months of}} the crackdown. After this period prices rise, but they are still 10 % lower than the pre-crackdown level. Input prices paid are uncorrelated with the wage premium received by the procurement officers of the hospitals when the audit intensity can be expected to be very low (prior to the crackdown) or very high (during the first months of the crackdown). After the initial six months, however, the effect of efficiency wages on prices is negative and well defined. The effects are economically significant: a 10 % increase in the procurement officer’s wage when the perceived probability of punishment is at the average of our sample is expected to bring about a 1. 2 % reduction in input prices.
