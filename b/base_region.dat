The Morale Welfare and Recreation center offered equipment for these outings, including fishbait and tackle, as well as boat rentals.

25|$|Detailed {{transistor}} {{models of}} transistor action, {{such as the}} Gummel–Poon model, account for the distribution of this charge explicitly to explain transistor behaviour more exactly. The charge-control view easily handles phototransistors, where minority carriers in the <b>base</b> <b>region</b> are created by the absorption of photons, and handles the dynamics of turn-off, or recovery time, which depends on charge in the <b>base</b> <b>region</b> recombining. However, because base charge is not a signal that is visible at the terminals, the current- and voltage-control views are generally used in circuit design and analysis.|$|E
25|$|Exposure of the {{transistor}} to {{ionizing radiation}} causes radiation damage. Radiation causes {{a buildup of}} 'defects' in the <b>base</b> <b>region</b> that act as recombination centers. The resulting reduction in minority carrier lifetime causes gradual loss of gain of the transistor.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we have {{presented}} {{a new face}} recognition algorithm <b>based</b> on <b>region</b> covariance matrix (RCM) descriptor computed in monogenic scale space. In the proposed model, energy information obtained using monogenic filter is used to represent a pixel at different scales to form region covariance matrix descriptor for each face image during training phase. An eigenvalue based distance measure is used to compute the similarity between face images. Extensive experimentation on AT&T and YALE face database has been conducted to reveal {{the performance of the}} monogenic scale space <b>based</b> <b>region</b> covariance matrix method and comparative analysis is made with the basic RCM method and Gabor <b>based</b> <b>region</b> covariance matrix method to exhibit the superiority of the proposed technique...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—An {{analytical}} model describing {{the dc voltage}} and current distributed effects in the polysilicon and intrinsic <b>base</b> <b>regions</b> of long stripe BJT’s with double polysilicon technology is presented. It is shown that the bias dependent debiasing effect in the base polysilicon contacts causes an unequal division of base current between two base polysilicon contacts and results in a re-distribution of base current in the <b>base</b> <b>regions</b> {{at different levels of}} current injection. The base resistance is also modulated by this current re-distribution effect at different biases. The change of base resistance with bias is calculated and the results show the importance of the distributed effects in the <b>base</b> polysilicon <b>region</b> in determining the base resistance. Index Terms — Base resistance, bipolar transistor, debiasing, device simulation, three-dimensional...|$|R
25|$|The {{physical}} {{explanation for}} collector current is {{the concentration of}} minority carriers in the <b>base</b> <b>region.</b> Due to low level injection (in which there are much fewer excess carriers than normal majority carriers) the ambipolar transport rates (in which the excess majority and minority carriers flow at the same rate) is in effect determined by the excess minority carriers.|$|E
25|$|The {{proportion}} of electrons able {{to cross the}} base and reach the collector {{is a measure of}} the BJT efficiency. The heavy doping of the emitter region and light doping of the <b>base</b> <b>region</b> causes many more electrons to be injected from the emitter into the base than holes to be injected from the base into the emitter.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} parameter is the common-base {{current gain}}, αF. The common-base current gain is approximately the gain of current from emitter to collector in the forward-active region. This ratio usually has a value close to unity; between 0.980 and 0.998. It {{is less than}} unity due to recombination of charge carriers as they cross the <b>base</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the link between}} low-level cortical acoustic processing and higher-level cortical phonemic processing. Specifically, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, it looks at 1) {{whether or not the}} vowels [ɑ] and [i] are distinguishable in regions of interest defined by the first two resonant frequencies (formants) of those vowels and 2) whether or not that neural discrimination ability changes <b>based</b> on anatomical <b>region.</b> The formant-frequency <b>based</b> <b>regions</b> of interest are found to respond differentially to [ɑ] and [i] with the response to [ɑ] statistically significantly greater than the response to [i] in the averaged [ɑ] formant-frequency <b>based</b> <b>region.</b> Unexpectedly, the response to [i] is numerically but not statistically significantly greater than the response to [ɑ] in the averaged [i] formant-frequency <b>based</b> <b>region.</b> Additionally, there is not a significant interaction of this pattern with anatomical region, although early cortical auditory regions appear to show the pattern while later ones do not. Further investigation into the results leads to the hypotheses that they could be due to task-specific neural processing strategies and that the link between lower and higher-level cortical auditory processing is more complex than originally hypothesized...|$|R

40|$|Region {{segmentation}} is {{the process}} of identifying the regions within an image, where a region is a group of connected pixels with similar properties. In this paper, we present a method of region segmentation using the scale-tree obtained from a datasieve - a recursive non-linear morphological lter. An initial segmentation of the image is done using the scale-tree <b>based</b> <b>region</b> growing method. We show that the properties of the datasieve scale-tree, in conjunction with the scale-tree <b>based</b> <b>region</b> growing method can be used to obtain the features of the objects in the image. The initial segmentation is then followed by post-processing methods for yielding a nal segmentation. The results presented for several color images show the methods to be promising...|$|R
25|$|A BJT {{consists}} of three differently doped semiconductor regions: the emitter region, the <b>base</b> <b>region</b> and the collector region. These regions are, respectively, p type, n type and p type in a PNP transistor, and n type, p type and n type in an NPN transistor. Each semiconductor region is connected to a terminal, appropriately labeled: emitter (E), base (B) and collector (C).|$|E
25|$|The base is {{physically}} located between the emitter and the collector and {{is made from}} lightly doped, high-resistivity material. The collector surrounds the emitter region, making it almost impossible for the electrons injected into the <b>base</b> <b>region</b> to escape without being collected, thus making the resulting value of α very close to unity, and so, giving the transistor a large β. A cross-section view of a BJT indicates that the collector–base junction has a much larger area than the emitter–base junction.|$|E
25|$|In typical operation, the base–emitter {{junction}} is forward biased, {{which means}} that the p-doped side of the junction is at a more positive potential than the n-doped side, and the base–collector junction is reverse biased. In an NPN transistor, when positive bias is applied to the base–emitter junction, the equilibrium is disturbed between the thermally generated carriers and the repelling electric field of the n-doped emitter depletion region. This allows thermally excited electrons to inject from the emitter into the <b>base</b> <b>region.</b> These electrons diffuse through the base from the region of high concentration near the emitter towards the region of low concentration near the collector. The electrons in the base are called minority carriers because the base is doped p-type, which makes holes the majority carrier in the base.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{variants}} and simplest form of incremental {{sheet metal}} forming process is single-point incremental forming in which a spherical ended tool is used to form features {{on one side of}} the initial plane of the sheet. Dimensional deviation is observed in the region of component opening (due to sheet bending) and at the wall as well as <b>base</b> <b>regions.</b> This article presents a methodology to minimize the dimensional deviation in the wall and <b>base</b> <b>regions</b> of single-point incremental forming formed components. The authors observed that the sheet deflection due to axial force and tool deflection due to radial force are the two main factors leading to the geometric deviation in wall as well as <b>base</b> <b>regions.</b> An analytical model has been developed for estimating these two deflections. These deflection values are incorporated in the tool path generation, and the components formed using the compensated tool path resulted in acceptable dimensional accuracy in the wall region. Force predictions carried out by force equilibrium method are used to calculate the deflection compensations as its predictions are in reasonably good agreement with the force predictions of finite element analysis and experimental measurements. Significant improvement in accuracy is achieved by using the deflection compensated tool paths...|$|R

25|$|Amphibians possess {{two types}} of glands, mucous and {{granular}} (serous). Both of these glands {{are part of the}} integument and thus considered cutaneous. Mucous and granular glands are both divided into three different sections which all connect to structure the gland as a whole. The three individual parts of the gland are the duct, the intercalary region, and lastly the alveolar gland (sac). Structurally, the duct is derived via keratinocytes and passes through {{to the surface of the}} epidermal or outer skin layer thus allowing external secretions of the body. The gland alveolus is a sac shaped structure which is found on the bottom or <b>base</b> <b>region</b> of the granular gland. The cells in this sac specialize in secretion. Between the alveolar gland and the duct is the intercalary system which can be summed up as a transitional region connecting the duct to the grand alveolar beneath the epidermal skin layer. In general, granular glands are larger in size than the mucous glands, however mucous glands hold a much greater majority in overall number.|$|E

2500|$|To {{minimize}} {{the percentage of}} carriers that recombine before reaching the collector–base junction, the transistor's <b>base</b> <b>region</b> must be thin enough that carriers can diffuse across it in much less time than the semiconductor's minority carrier lifetime. In particular, {{the thickness of the}} base must be much less than the [...] of the electrons. The collector–base junction is reverse-biased, and so little electron injection occurs from the collector to the base, but electrons that diffuse through the base towards the collector are swept into the collector by the electric field in the depletion region of the collector–base junction. The thin shared base and asymmetric collectoremitter doping are what differentiates a bipolar transistor from two separate and oppositely biased diodes connected in series.|$|E

2500|$|NPN {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of bipolar transistors, {{consisting}} of a layer of P-doped semiconductor (the [...] "base") between two N-doped layers. A small current entering the base is amplified to produce a large collector and emitter current. That is, when there is a positive potential difference measured from the base of an NPN transistor to its emitter (that is, when the base is high relative to the emitter), as well as a positive potential difference measured from the collector to the emitter, the transistor becomes active. In this [...] "on" [...] state, current flows from the collector to the emitter of the transistor. Most of the current is carried by electrons moving from emitter to collector as minority carriers in the P-type <b>base</b> <b>region.</b> To allow for greater current and faster operation, most bipolar transistors used today are NPN because electron mobility is higher than hole mobility.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} the use of {{distributed}} elements is in the modelling of the <b>base</b> <b>region</b> of a bipolar junction transistor at high frequencies.

The gradual addition of netropsin to poly(dA-dT) results in structural perturbations extending into the antibiotic-free <b>base</b> pair <b>regions</b> that begin to level off above 0. 02 antibiotic molecules per polynucleotide phosphate (P/D = 50). The NMR chemical shift parameters at the antibiotic-free <b>base</b> pair <b>regions</b> in the P/D = 50 complex suggest changes in the glycosidic torsion angles of the deoxyadenosine and thymidine residues and less pronounced changes in the base pair overlap geometries.
