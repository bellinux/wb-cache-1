5|$|Van Tatenhove sentenced Farmer to 27 {{months in}} federal prison on January 14, 2014. He {{recommended}} that the sentence be served at the Federal Correctional Institution in Manchester, Farmer's hometown, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Bureau of Prisons opted to assign him to the United States Penitentiary, Hazelton near Bruceton Mills, West Virginia. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted that Farmer's inmate number, 16226-032, was reminiscent of his college jersey number, 32.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the East–West Telegraph line in the 1870s, along Eyre's route, resulted in a hazardous trail that could be followed for interstate travel. A national highway was called for, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government {{did not see the}} route as important enough until 1941, when a war in the Pacific seemed imminent. The highway was constructed between July 1941 and June 1942, but was trafficable by January 1942. Though originally named Forrest Highway, after John Forrest, by the war cabinet, it was officially named and gazetted Eyre Highway, a name agreed upon by the states' nomenclature committees.|$|E
5|$|President Obama {{signed the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) on 23 March 2010. As of 1 August 2011, female {{contraception}} {{was added to}} a list of preventive services covered by the ACA that would be provided without patient co-payment. The federal mandate applied to all new health insurance plans in all states from 1 August 2012. Grandfathered plans did not have to comply unless they changed substantially. To be grandfathered, a group plan must have existed or an individual plan must have been sold before President Obama signed the law; otherwise they were required to comply with the new law. The Guttmacher Institute noted that even before the federal mandate was implemented, twenty-eight states had their own mandates that required health insurance to cover the prescription contraceptives, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> mandate innovated by forbidding insurance companies from charging part of the cost to the patient.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} was highly {{supportive of the}} war efforts. The political left supported the war (unlike World War I, which Socialists opposed.) The churches showed much less pacifism than in 1914. The Church of God, based in Anderson, had a strong pacifist element, reaching a high point in the late 1930s. The Church regarded World War II as a just war because America was attacked. Anti-Communist sentiment has since kept strong pacifism from developing in the Church of God. Likewise the Quakers, with a strong base near Richmond, generally regarded World War II as a just war and about 90% served, although there were some conscientious objectors. The Mennonites and Brethren continued their pacifism, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government was much less hostile than before. The churches helped their young men to both become conscientious objectors and to provide valuable service to the nation. Goshen College set up a training program for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs. Although the young women pacifists were not liable to the draft, they volunteered for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs to demonstrate their patriotism; many worked in mental hospitals.|$|E

Facing Gordon Granger's Reserve Corps, supported by artillery Hindman's and Johnson's divisions tried to break <b>the</b> Union's lines, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>federals,</b> partially armed with Colt revolving rifles, repulsed the assaulting Confederates. Fading daylight ended all hostilities, and the nightly retreat of Rosecrans' army ended the battle.|$|R
25|$|California-Nevada Interstate Maglev: High-speed maglev {{lines between}} major cities of {{southern}} California and Las Vegas are under study via the California-Nevada Interstate Maglev Project.

25|$|As {{a result}} of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and {{subsequent}} legislation which pushed for longer sentences, less judicial discretion, and more harsh sentences for drug-related offenses, the federal inmate population doubled in the 1980s and again in the 1990s. The population increase has decelerated since the early 2000s <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> inmate population continues to grow.|$|E

25|$|The {{battle of}} Memphis was, {{aside from the}} later {{appearance}} of the ironclad CSS Arkansas, the final challenge to the federal thrust down the Mississippi River against Vicksburg. The river was now open down to that city, which was already besieged by Farragut's ships, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> army authorities did not grasp the strategic importance of the fact for nearly another six months. Not until November 1862 would the Union Army under Ulysses S. Grant attempt to complete {{the opening of the}} river.|$|E
25|$|Having {{overcome}} {{the disadvantage of}} providing its own financing, the Lutheran Hour was now the largest religious broadcast in radio. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Council sought to end all such endeavours, allowing no viewpoint except its own. Championing the cause of religious freedom and freedom of speech, Maier was a strong voice against such “totalitarian tendencies.” As portrayed in a 1938 article by Time magazine, Maier’s pulpit helped to preserve the heritage of liberty enjoyed by citizens of the United States.|$|E
25|$|By 2000, a high-occupancy vehicle lane {{was added}} to the {{eastbound}} Gowanus Expressway to serve traffic heading toward Manhattan. Over the years, the viaduct structure of the Gowanus Expressway has deteriorated. In 1998, a $16 million feasibility study for a tunnel for the Gowanus Expressway was awarded. The New York State Department of Transportation was considering putting the road in a tunnel, but in November 2011 the Federal Highway Administration canceled the project. The viaduct's vertical steel supports show material missing due to rust, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government promises it won't collapse.|$|E

25|$|In October 2010 {{before the}} vote, eight Shelby County {{citizens}} had {{filed a lawsuit}} in federal court against {{the state and the}} Shelby County Elections Commission against the dual-voting requirement. Plaintiffs argued that total votes for the referendum should have been counted together, rather than as separate elections. City voters narrowly supported the measure for consolidation with 50.8% in favor; county voters overwhelmingly voted against the measure with 85% against. The state argued that with the election decided, the lawsuit should be dismissed, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> court disagreed.|$|E
25|$|The private {{profit motive}} {{dominated}} the movement westward, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Government played {{a supporting role}} in securing land through treaties and setting up territorial governments, with governors appointed by the President. The federal government first acquired western territory through treaties with other nations or native tribes. Then it sent surveyors to map and document the land. By the 20th century Washington bureaucracies managed the federal lands such as the General Land Office in the Interior department, and after 1891 the Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture. After 1900 dam building and flood control became major concerns.|$|E
25|$|On September 16, McClellan confronted Lee near Sharpsburg, {{defending}} {{a line to}} the west of Antietam Creek. At dawn on September 17, the Battle of Antietam began, with Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's corps mounting a powerful assault on Lee's left flank. Attacks and counterattacks swept across the Miller Cornfield and the woods near the Dunker Church. Union assaults against the Sunken Road ("Bloody Lane") eventually pierced the Confederate center, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> advantage was not pressed. In each case, Confederate reinforcements from the right flank prevented a complete Union breakthrough and McClellan refused to release his reserves to complete the breakthrough.|$|E

For four days the little army held its position, {{prepared}} to give battle if <b>the</b> enemy advanced; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federals,</b> though greatly superior in numbers, remained immovable at Martinsburg, and Johnston, to the great disgust of his troops, retired to Winchester. The soldiers were longing to meet the invaders in battle, but their general had {{to bear in mind}} that the force under his command might at any moment be urgently required to join the main Confederate army and aid in opposing the Northern advance upon Richmond.|$|R

25|$|Currently {{the sky is}} {{continuously}} monitored, but intervention {{resources are}} usually available only during the day. Usually, increased availability of resources is limited to major exercises, international conferences (WEF), or crises (e.g. the Libyan Civil War in 2011). This heightened state is called PlÜ + (PlÜ PLUS) or ILANA. The Swiss Federal Assembly has adopted a requirement that armed interceptors are to be ready 24 hours all day, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Council has not released the necessary funding. Meeting the parliamentary requirement would require increased operations at two air bases as well as modifications to civilian sites Geneva Airport and Zürich Airport. This objective not is expected be met until 2020.|$|E
25|$|The Leduc {{discovery}} and {{the string of}} even bigger ones that followed rapidly backed imported oil out of the Canadian prairies and produced a huge surplus of oil which had no immediate market. In 1949, Imperial Oil applied {{to the federal government}} to build the Interprovincial Pipeline (IPL) to Lake Superior, and in 1950 it was completed to the port of Superior, Wisconsin. Many people questioned why it was built to an American port rather than a Canadian one, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government was more interested in the fact that oil exports made a huge difference to Canada's trade balance and completely erased the country's balance of trade deficit.|$|E
25|$|In November 2009, METRO {{applied for}} $900 million {{grant from the}} Federal Transit Administration to fund future construction. Allegations were made that METRO lied about the income from their sales tax revenue {{to allow them to}} gain $900 million in federal funds for all five planned rail expansions. However, city {{officials}} found no such attempt by METRO to mislead them, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Transit Administration continued to withhold its approval for the money until further figures can be examined. On December 8, 2011, the FTA finally announced the award. The award of $900 million was broken into two $450 million grants from the New Starts transit program, to fund construction of the Red Line Extension and Purple lines.|$|E
