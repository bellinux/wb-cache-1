5|$|After earning enough money, Kertész quickly {{bought his}} first camera (an ICA <b>box</b> <b>camera)</b> in 1912, despite his family's protests to {{continue}} his career in business. In his free time, he photographed the local peasants, gypsies, and landscape of the surrounding Hungarian Plains (the puszta). His first photograph {{is believed to be}} Sleeping Boy, Budapest, 1912. His photographs were first published in 1917 in the magazine Érdekes Újság, during World War I, while Kertész was serving in the Austro-Hungarian army. As early as 1914 (for example, Eugene, 1914), his distinctive and mature style was already evident.|$|E

Riis sued him in court successfully. Nagle {{suggested}} that Riis should become self-sufficient, so in January 1888 Riis paid $25 for a 4×5 <b>box</b> <b>camera,</b> plateholders, a tripod and equipment for developing and printing. He took the equipment to the potter's field cemetery on Hart Island to practice, making two exposures. The result was seriously overexposed but successful.|$|E

500|$|Florey owned no {{camera at}} the time, and {{his efforts to}} obtain one were {{unsuccessful}} until he met Vorkapić. Florey said of their discussion: [...] "I say to Slav, 'Slav, I have an idea but not much money. You have a camera and are a clever painter. Let's make the picture in collaboration and we split the benefit.'" [...] Vorkapić himself claimed to have said: [...] "Florey, you get me 100 dollars and I'll make you a picture in my own kitchen." [...] Vorkapić allowed Florey to borrow a small <b>box</b> <b>camera</b> that he had purchased with the proceeds {{from the sale of}} one of his oil paintings. It was a DeVry camera with one lens, a type that Florey said was sold as a [...] "toy". Florey also had trouble obtaining film, as he found it cost-prohibitive to purchase negative and positive film from film laboratories. However, Florey knew that [...] "film ends", scraps of leftover unexposed film stock, were often discarded after shooting on big budget Hollywood films, so he attempted to persuade filmmakers to give them to him. Camera work had just been completed on The Gaucho, a film starring Douglas Fairbanks, {{and he was able to}} obtain more than 1,000 feet of film from the production in 10- and 20-foot strips. Florey then spliced the film ends together by hand, a process he found time-consuming and frustrating, but one that resulted in the equivalent of a full reel of negative film. Fairbanks, who had previously hired Florey to handle his European public relations, provided financial assistance for the production of A Hollywood Extra. He also gave Florey access to his editing rooms and helped provide him with film ends.|$|E
2500|$|German Jesuit {{scientist}} Gaspar Schott {{heard from}} a traveler about a small camera obscura device {{he had seen in}} Spain, which one could carry under one arm and could be hidden under a coat. He then constructed his own sliding <b>box</b> <b>camera</b> obscura, which could focus by sliding a wooden box part fitted inside another wooden box part.

2500|$|As {{a present}} for his 16th {{birthday}} Weston's father gave him his first camera, a Kodak Bull's-Eye #2, which was a simple <b>box</b> <b>camera.</b> He took it on vacation in the Midwest, {{and by the time}} he returned home his interest in photography was enough to lead him to purchase a used 5 × 7inch view camera. He began photographing in Chicago parks and a farm owned by his aunt, and developed his own film and prints. Later he would remember that even at that early age his work showed strong artistic merit. He said, [...] "I feel that my earliest work of 1903 ‒ though immature ‒ is related more closely, both with technique and composition, to my latest work than are several of my photographs dating from 1913–1920, a period in which I was trying to be artistic." ...|$|E

50|$|While waist-level viewfinders {{have been}} common in <b>box</b> <b>cameras</b> since the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, large viewfinders of the sort that are suitable for ttv photography became popular in the late 1920s and 1930s with medium format TLR and pseudo TLR cameras such as the Rolleiflex and the Voigtländer Brillant. Similar large, clear square viewfinders were popular in TLRs and pseudo TLRs until the mid-1960s. These medium format cameras became less popular with the advent of 35mm SLRs and compact cameras in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{invention}} of photographic processes {{there was no way}} to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them. The earliest cameras were room-sized, with space for one or more people inside; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models. By Niépce's time portable <b>box</b> <b>camerae</b> obscurae suitable for photography were readily available. The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by Johann Zahn in 1685, though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible.|$|R

The future is clearly moving into a direction where the number of things connected to the Internet will overwhelm the number of connected people. Predictions range up to a factor of 100 to 1 or more: the Internet of People will transform into the Internet of Things.|$|R
