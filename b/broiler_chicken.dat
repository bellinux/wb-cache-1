5|$|The {{breeding}} of farm animals seldom occurs spontaneously but is managed by farmers {{with a view}} to encouraging certain traits that are seen as desirable. These include hardiness, prolificness, mothering abilities, fast growth rates, low feed consumption per unit of growth, better body proportions, higher yields, better fibre qualities and other characteristics. Undesirable traits such as health defects, aggressiveness or lack of docility are selected against. Selective breeding has been responsible for some large increases in productivity. In 2007, a typical <b>broiler</b> <b>chicken</b> at eight weeks old was 4.8 times as heavy as a bird of similar age in 1957. In the thirty years to 2007, the average milk yield of a dairy cow in the United States nearly doubled.|$|E

Unlike the Double Supreme, the new Big King lacked the interior bread piece the Big Mac had, and the advertising used to promote the Big King continued to utilize the 75% more beef claim. However, the new sandwich was introduced while the company was dealing with a highly publicized beef recall from one of its key suppliers, Hudson Foods, and had to deal with accusations that the introduction was designed to distract the public and media from the recall. The sandwich was initially introduced in the United States at a 99¢ (USD) price point, which helped propel sales to nearly twice the estimated volume and causing many locations to sell out of the burger patties used to produce the sandwich.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine if a DNA vaccine carrying large segment gene of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) could confer protection against infectious bursal disease (IBD) in <b>broiler</b> <b>chickens</b> in the presence of maternal antibody. <b>Broiler</b> <b>chickens</b> with maternal antibody titers to IBDV were intramuscularly injected with a DNA plasmid coding for VP 2, VP 3, and VP 4 genes of IBDV strain variant E (VE) (P/VP 243 /E) at 1 -day, 1 -week, and/or 2 weeks old. The dose of P/VP 243 /E used ranging from 400 mu g to 10 mg. <b>Broiler</b> <b>chickens</b> at 3 weeks old were orally challenged with IBDV strain (VE) and observed for 10 days. Only <b>broiler</b> <b>chickens</b> vaccinated with 7. 5 or 10 mg of P/VP 243 /E 3 times had 90 or 100 % protection against challenge by IBDV strain VE and protected <b>broiler</b> <b>chickens</b> had significantly higher (P 0. 05) in ELISA or VN titers to IBDV among all groups of <b>broiler</b> <b>chickens</b> or among the groups of <b>broiler</b> <b>chickens</b> vaccinated with various dose of P/VP 243 /E before challenge. <b>Broiler</b> <b>chickens</b> in the groups receiving 7. 5 or 10 mg of P/VP 243 /E had significantly lower (P< 0. 05) DIM or VN titers to IBDV than those in the challenge control (CC) groups or the other groups vaccinated with various dose of P/VP 243 /E after challenge. <b>Broiler</b> <b>chickens</b> in the groups vaccinated with 10 mg of P/VP 243 /E 3 times had significantly higher (P < 0. 05) stimulation indices for IBDV-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation response than those in the vector control (VC) or CC group at 14, 21, 24, or 31 days after first DNA vaccination.
