40|$|Phylogenetic tree {{reconstruction}} {{for a set}} {{of species}} is an important problem for understanding the evolutionary history of the species. Existing algorithms usually represent each species as a binary string with each bit indicating whether a particular gene/protein exists in the species. Given the topology of a phylogenetic tree with each leaf representing a species (a binary string of equal length) and each internal node representing the hypothetical ancestor, the Fitch-Hartigan algorithm and the Sankoff algorithm are two polynomial-time algorithms which assign binary strings to internal nodes such that the total Hamming distance between adjacent nodes in the tree is minimized. However, these algorithms oversimplify the evolutionary process by considering only the number of protein insertions/deletions (Hamming distance) between two species and by assuming the evolutionary history of each protein is independent. Since the function of a protein may depend on the existence of other proteins, the evolutionary history of these functionally dependent proteins should be similar, i. e. functionally dependent proteins should usually be present (or absent) in a species at the same time. Thus, in addition to the Hamming distance, the protein linkage distance for some pairs/sets of proteins: whole <b>block</b> <b>linkage</b> distance, partial <b>block</b> <b>linkage</b> distance, pairwise linkage distance is introduced. It is proved that the phylogenetic tree reconstruction problem to find the binary strings for the internal nodes of a phylogenetic tree that minimizes the sum of the Hamming distance and the linkage distance is NP-hard. In this thesis, a general algorithm to solve the phylogenetic tree reconstruction with protein linkage problem which runs in O(4 ^m⋅n) time for whole/partial <b>block</b> <b>linkage</b> distance and O(4 ^m⋅⋅ (m+n)) time for pairwise linkage distance (compared to the straight-forward O(4 ^m⋅ m⋅ n) or O(4 ^m⋅ m^ 2 ⋅⋅ n) time algorithm) is introduced where n is the number of species and m is the length of the binary string (number of proteins). It is further shown, by experiments, that our algorithm using linkage information can construct more accurate trees (better matches with the trees constructed by biologists) than the algorithms using only Hamming distance. published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E

Designed to simulate {{a high degree of}} epistasis, these deception problems imitate extremely difficult real world problems. [1]. Studies show that Bayesian optimization and explicit building block manipulation algorithms, like the fast messy genetic algorithm (fmGA), can help in solving these problems. This paper compares the results acquired from an extended multiobjective fast messy genetic algorithm (MOMGA-IIa), ordinary multiobjective fast messy genetic algorithm (MOMGA-II), multiobjective Bayesian optimization algorithm (mBOA), and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) when applied to three different deception problems. The extended MOMGA-II is enhanced with a new technique exploiting the fmGA’s basis function to improve partitioned searching in both the genotype and phenotype domain. The three deceptive problems studied are: interleaved minimal deceptive problem, interleaved 5 -bit trap function, and interleaved 6 -bit bipolar function. The unmodified MOMGA-II, by design, explicitly learns building <b>block</b> <b>linkages,</b> a requirement if an algorithm is to solve these hard deception problems. Results using the MOMGA-IIa are excellent when compared to the non-explicit building block algorithm results of both the mBOA and NSGA-II. ...|$|R

The method {{was designed to}} accurately compute vibrational modes of partially optimized molecular structures. The key concept was the introduction of several blocks of atoms, which can move as rigid bodies {{with respect to a}} local, fully optimized subsystem. The choice of the blocks was restricted in the sense that none of them could be connected, and also linear blocks were not taken into consideration. In this paper an extended version of the MBH method is presented that is generally applicable and allows blocks to be adjoined by one or two common atoms. This extension to all possible block partitions of the molecule provides a structural flexibility varying from very rigid to extremely relaxed. The general MBH method is very well suited to study selected normal modes of large macromolecules (such as proteins and polymers) because the number of degrees of freedom can be greatly reduced while still keeping the essential motions of the molecular system. The {{reduction in the number of}} degrees of freedom due to the <b>block</b> <b>linkages</b> is imposed here directly using a constraint method, in contrast to restraint methods where stiff harmonic couplings are introduced to restrain the relative motion of the blocks. The computational cost of this constraint method is less than that of an implementation using a restraint method.

40|$|The {{synthetic}} engineering of anionic polyoxometalate (POM) clusters with predefined properties {{tailored to}} specific applications {{is a great}} challenge using routine “one-pot ” POM syntheses. Under such conditions, difficulties often arise from the multitude of complex reaction pathways and self-assembly processes occurring in solution. In this respect the major role of the charge balancing cations cannot be ignored, in fact such cations are crucial, both in the assembly of the building <b>blocks,</b> <b>linkage</b> to the overall cluster, and then assembly into the bulk material. Further, {{the role of the}} cation facilitating the selective crystallization of a particular cluster type cannot be divorced from the reaction process since the crystallization process itself can help pull “virtual ” building blocks into being. This perspective briefly outlines our efforts towards engineering novel POM based materials, highlighting the use of large organic cations as “Shrink-wrapping ” agents to isolate new POM clusters, frameworks and cage compounds. Central to this perspective is the hypothesis that, in the case of POM cluster assembly, the mechanism and various equilibria which define the clusters can be controlled by the selective crystallisation using cation control. Consequently, this indicates that the process of crystallisation can {{have a profound effect on}} self-assembly at the molecular level. We therefore propose that the crystallization process itself may define the molecular structure of the cluster leading to the conundrum, which came first, the cluster or the crystal of the cluster? 1...|$|R
40|$|In sexual populations, {{selection}} operates neither on {{the whole}} genome, which is repeatedly taken apart and reassembled by recombination, nor on individual alleles that are tightly linked to the chromosomal neighborhood. The resulting interference between linked alleles reduces the efficiency of selection and distorts patterns of genetic diversity.

Here, we present a simple but powerful scaling analysis identifying the unit of selection as the genomic "linkage block" with a characteristic length determined in a self-consistent manner by the condition {{that the rate of}} recombination within the block is comparable to the fitness differences between different alleles of the block. We find that an asexual model with the strength of selection tuned to that of the <b>linkage</b> <b>block</b> provides an excellent description of genetic diversity and the site frequency spectra when compared to computer simulations.

A standard machine learning pipeline for the entity resolution problem consists of three major components: <b>blocking,</b> pairwise <b>linkage,</b> and clustering.

Next, the linkage step assigns a probability score to pairs of records inside each block. If a pair scores above a user-defined threshold, the records are presumed to represent the same entity. Finally, the clustering step turns the input records into clusters of records (or profiles), where each cluster is uniquely associated with a single real-world entity.

Inversion, the operator usually called upon to solve this problem, has proven too slow vis a vis the forces of selection. Inversion is a mutation like operator that acts on chromosomal structures.

We assayed {{the effects of these}} mutations on activation of the TCRbeta locus in normal T- and B-lineage cells by RAG- 2 (recombination-activating gene 2) -deficient blastocyst complementation. We found that Ebeta is required for rearrangement and germ-line transcription of the TCRbeta locus in T-lineage cells. In the absence of Ebeta, the heavy-chain intronic enhancer partially supported joining region beta-chain rearrangement in T- but not in B-lineage cells. However, ability of the heavy-chain intronic enhancer to induce rearrangements was <b>blocked</b> by <b>linkage</b> to an expressed neomycin-resistance gene (neo(r)).

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [106]- 111). The use of recombinant {{inbred lines}} (RILs) {{in the construction}} of a detailed genetic linkage map presents several advantages to the mapping investigator. First, as loci are driven to homozygosity by the process of inbreeding, various short <b>linkage</b> <b>blocks</b> become fixed such that additional generations no longer segregate; thus, a perpetual supply of germ plasm is produced. Also, additional meioses throughout the course of inbreeding allow for increased opportunities for recombination, thereby allowing a more accurate estimation of linkage relationships. In this study, a detailed pea genetic linkage map was constructed using recombinant inbred lines. Numerous marker types were employed. Initial efforts focused upon morphological and allozyme characters, with the majority of the emphasis placed upon Random Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs). The purpose of such efforts was to confirm the location of numerous markers on a pea genetic linkage map previously constructed using an F 2 progeny array and to further refine the map with additional unique markers. Results did in fact confirm the location of almost all markers common to both the F 2 and RIL studies. The RIL map is presented in nine <b>linkage</b> <b>blocks</b> corresponding to the seven linkage groups of pea, compared to eight <b>linkage</b> <b>blocks</b> in the F 2 study. The initial stages of the study focused on the confirmation of the location of morphological and allozyme loci; later efforts emphasized RAPDs. Mapping efforts involved eleven morphological and six isozyme loci. To complement these, 88 RAPD primers were selected from an original survey of over 400 primers. This resulted in the assignment of 181 markers to the current RIL map, 93 of which are common to the F 2 study. Eightyeight additional unique markers were added to the RIL map as well, thereby saturating it further and serving to resolve questionable linkage relationships unanswered by the F 2 study. Comparisons of only those markers common to both the F 2 and RIL studies did indicate some expansion of RILs over F 2 S; however, elimination of linkage-phase complications and marker dominance through the use of RILs has resulted in a more detailed map whose linkage relationships are arguably more reliable.

Since it is plausible that additional variants in this region contribute to the risk {{of prostate cancer}}, we have used next-generation sequencing technology to resequence a ~ 97 -kb region that includes the area surrounding MSMB (chr 10 : 51, 168, 025 – 51, 265, 101) in 36 prostate cancer cases, 26 controls of European origin, and 8 unrelated CEPH individuals in order to identify additional variants to investigate in functional studies. We identified 241 novel polymorphisms within this region, including 142 in the 51 -kb <b>block</b> of <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium (LD) that contains rs 10993994 and the proximal promoter of MSMB. No sites were observed to be polymorphic within the exons of MSMB...|$|R

The intensity of selection affecting {{the distribution of}} pollen types in the outcross pool was also estimated and comparisons were made between the selective values of genes in the pools of uniting ovules and pollen. The estimates show that selection was intense at various stages {{of the life cycle}} and that viability {{and fertility}} components often opposed one another. Estimates of viability and fertility components of selection were also extended to the three-locus level. The multilocus estimates reveal large differences in viability and fertility among homozygous genotypes. It is concluded that strong selection operates at all life cycle stages in CCV, although often in differing directions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlpha 1 -antitrypsin {{deficiency}} {{results from}} point mutations that distort {{the structure of}} the protein to allow a unique protein–protein interaction that we have termed loop-sheet polymerization. Polymers of Zα 1 -antitrypsin accumulate within hepatocytes to form inclusion bodies that are associated with juvenile cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The lack of circulating protein predisposes the Z α 1 -antitrypsin homozygote to emphysema. This polymerization process also occurs in variants of other members of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) superfamily, antithrombin, C 1 -inhibitor and α 1 -antichymotrypsin in association with thrombosis, angio-oedema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease respectively, and we have recently shown that it underlies a novel inclusion body dementia. Understanding this mechanism of polymerization allows rational drug design to <b>block</b> the protein–protein <b>linkage</b> and so ameliorate the associated disease...|$|R

In this paper, we study the problem of differentially private histogram release for random workloads. We study two multidimensional partitioning strategies including: 1) a baseline cell-based partitioning strategy for releasing an equi-width cell histogram, and 2) an innovative 2 -phase kd-tree based partitioning strategy for releasing a v-optimal histogram. We formally analyze {{the utility of the}} released histograms and quantify the errors for answering lin-ear queries such as counting queries. We formally characterize the property of the input data that will guarantee the optimality of the algorithm. Finally, we implement and experimentally evaluate several applications using the released histograms, including counting queries, classification, and <b>blocking</b> for record <b>linkage</b> and show the benefit of our approach...|$|R
40|$|Environmental and {{resource}} regimes, operating {{at different levels}} of social organization, vary in terms of factors such as the sources of actor behavior, the knowledge available to actors, the operation of compliance mechanisms, the use of policy instruments, {{and the nature of the}} broader social setting. Cross-level interactions among scale-dependent regimes can result in patterns of dominance, separation, merger, negotiated agreement, or system change. The mechanisms that determine which of these patterns will occur include authority/power differentials, limits of decentralization, dueling discourses, cognitive transitions, and <b>blocking</b> coalitions. Recurrent <b>linkages</b> or syndromes occur in this realm, e. g., limitations of authority and power regularly produce negotiated agreements in such forms as comanagement arrangements. The consequences of these interactions are often far-reaching as measured in terms of ecological sustainability, social welfare/efficiency, cultural values, and robustness...|$|R
