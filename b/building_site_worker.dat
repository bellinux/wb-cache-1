5000|$|The pay of {{merchant}} seamen {{was poor}} {{when compared to}} the pay received by a factory worker or <b>building</b> <b>site</b> <b>worker</b> ashore. [...] A primary factor was the long working hours of the merchant seaman who had a basic working week of 64 hours before overtime compared with the working week of 44 hours in the building industry then or 47 hours in the engineering industry. In 1943 the seaman's basic working week was reduced to 56 hours.Considerable resentment was felt by seamen after learning that seamen of the U.S. Merchant Marine earned more than double their wages.|$|E

Within the <b>building</b> <b>site,</b> <b>workers</b> share and split dynamically the work, join their local works automatically into a global work and achieve conciliation. The corresponding services are provided through low cost communication services available on standard Internet workstations. A generic solution allows distributing dynamically the scene graph beyond the different users. The users form a meeting to interact on the global scene while keeping the work consistent. They can resolve the choices of design through a conciliation procedure. The solution allows a low cost deployment and highly usable collaboration services. In contrast with other solutions, the collaboration services fit the design activity of manufacturing products and only use best effort communication services...|$|R

In the company of several allies, the two are soon confronted by dark forces led by the dastardly Thomas Edison, John Pierpont Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, and Guglielmo Marconi.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} {{the first phase}} of a longitudinal study underway in Australia to ascertain the broad health benefits of specific types of biophilic design for <b>workers</b> in a <b>building</b> <b>site</b> office. A bespoke site design was formulated to include open plan workspace, natural lighting, ventilation, significant plants, prospect and views, recycled materials and use of non-synthetic materials. Initial data {{in the first three months}} was gathered from a series of demographic questions and from interviews and observations of <b>site</b> <b>workers.</b> Preliminary data indicates a strong positive effect from incorporating aspects of biophilic design to boost productivity, ameliorate stress, enhance well-being, foster a collaborative work environment and promote workplace satisfaction, thus contributing towards a high performance workspace. The longitudinal study spanning over two years will track human-plant interactions in a biophilic influenced space, whilst also assessing the concomitant cognitive, social, psychological and physical health benefits for workers...|$|R

The distinction between indirect cost made on <b>building</b> <b>site</b> and indirect cost made by headquarter of a company were shown, as well as necessity of including both on them in calculating <b>building</b> <b>site</b> effectiveness. Three different method of assigning company overhead cost to the <b>building</b> <b>site</b> were shown and discussed. Their significant influence on <b>building</b> <b>site</b> profitability was emphasised and calculated for exemplary values. The necessity of calculating full cost for each <b>building</b> <b>site</b> operating by one company was discussed in the article too, by showing which information is necessary for a company management, a <b>building</b> <b>site</b> management and for company shareholders...|$|R
