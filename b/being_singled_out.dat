5|$|The film {{received}} generally positive reviews, with critics {{praising the}} ensemble cast, and each lead <b>being</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> for their performances across reviews. The plot received a more mixed response; some reviewers felt that its dark, humorous premise was explored well, while others felt the jokes were racist, homophobic and misogynistic. A sequel, Horrible Bosses 2, {{was released on}} November 26, 2014.|$|E
5|$|As {{it became}} {{apparent}} that, not only were conditions in the ghettos terrible (hunger, diseases, etc.), but that the Jews were <b>being</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> for extermination at Nazi concentration camps, they increasingly tried to escape and hide {{in order to survive}} the war. Many Polish Gentiles concealed hundreds of thousands of their Jewish neighbors. Many of these efforts arose spontaneously from individual initiatives, but there were also organized networks dedicated to aiding the Jews.|$|E
5|$|The Projected Man has {{received}} mixed reviews. Several sources were {{critical of the}} film's resemblance to other science fiction films, with The Fly and 4D Man <b>being</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> by critics and moviegoers alike as possible inspirations, although the film's executive producer Richard Gordon has denied this. The Projected Man was featured in a ninth season episode of comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000, and has been released on DVD by Cinema Club.|$|E

2500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{was generally}} unfavourable, with the album's lyrics <b>being</b> particularly <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> as substandard.

50|$|Craxi {{was also}} known for never apologising, {{as a matter of}} principle; most Italians {{expected}} an apology after the corrupt system had been exposed.

25|$|A {{prominent}} {{affiliate of}} the Iron Guard, a Romanian fascist organization {{also known as}} the Legionnaire Movement, Trifa played a part in provoking the Legionnaires' Rebellion of 1941. His antisemitic discourse was suspected of helping instigate the parallel pogrom against the Jewish community in Bucharest. After <b>being</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> as a rebel by Ion Antonescu, Romania's Conducător and a competitor of the Iron Guard, he spent the final years of World War II in Nazi Germany, as a detainee with privileged status. Trifa subsequently made his way into the United States, where he came to lead the Romanian-American Orthodox community into opposition with the main Orthodox Church in Communist Romania.|$|E
50|$|The {{banning of}} Yandere Simulator was criticized by its {{anonymous}} developer, {{who believed that}} the game was <b>being</b> arbitrarily <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> with no explanation, as Twitch has not banned other games with similarly excessive sexual or violent content such as Mortal Kombat X, Grand Theft Auto, or The Witcher 3.|$|R
5000|$|Many black rappers--including Ice-T and Sister Souljah--contend {{that they}} are <b>being</b> unfairly <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> because their music {{reflects}} deep changes in society not being addressed {{anywhere else in the}} public forum.

25|$|It was {{impossible}} that Meleager and Perdiccas should long continue on friendly terms, and Meleager proved {{no match for}} Perdiccas. Perdiccas contrived to lull his rival into a sense of security, while he made himself master of Philip Arrhidaeus. Then he struck the first blow. The whole army was assembled under the pretence of a general review. Then the king, at the instigation of Perdiccas, suddenly demanded the surrender and punishment of all {{the leaders of the}} recent disorders. The infantry were taken by surprise, with 300 of the alleged mutineers <b>being</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> and executed. Although Meleager was not personally attacked, he fled and took refuge in a temple, where he was pursued and put to death on the orders of Perdiccas.|$|E
25|$|Gran Fury {{functioned as}} the {{anonymous}} art collective that produced {{all of the}} artistic media for ACT UP. The group remained anonymous because it allowed the collective {{to function as a}} cohesive unit without any one voice <b>being</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out.</b> The mission of the group was {{to bring an end to}} the AIDS Crisis by making reference to the issues plaguing society at large, especially homophobia and the lack of public investment in the AIDS epidemic, through bringing art works into the public sphere in order to reach the maximum audience. The group often faced censorship in their proceedings, including being rejected for public billboard space and being threatened with censorship in art exhibitions. When faced with this censorship, Gran Fury often posted their work illegally on the walls of the streets.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s Parsons was {{recognized}} as a proponent of racial integration, in contrast to most of his professional colleagues. In 1924 the Army War College surveyed commissioned officers about whether and how to integrate Army units. At the time, African Americans served in segregated units, usually under white officers. Based on his experience in the Spanish-American War and his observations of African American soldiers during World War I, Parsons argued for desegregating Army units and having each one incorporate a set percentage of black soldiers. In his view, black soldiers {{could be expected to}} perform capably if given the same training as whites, and incorporating them into units with whites would prevent them from <b>being</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> for inferior duties like kitchen patrol and the loading and unloading of cargo. Parsons was convinced that African Americans could also serve as officers, although his point of view was {{that they would not be}} able to lead white soldiers effectively due to the prejudice of the times, but could instead aspire to command positions in the transportation and supply units that often contained large numbers of black soldiers in wartime. The Army did not agree with Parsons' recommendations, and continued to allow African Americans to serve only in segregated units, and with few opportunities for assignment to leadership positions.|$|E

Similar experiences are described in e.g. scouting sex abuse cases and Jehovah's Witnesses and child sex abuse.|$|R
50|$|Saint Paulinus of Trier (died 358) was {{bishop of}} Trier and a {{supporter}} of Athanasius in the conflict with Arianism. At the Synod of Arles of 353 he was targeted by the Arians, and was exiled to Phrygia, <b>being</b> effectively <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> by the Emperor Constantius II. He died in exile five years later, but his remains were returned to Trier in 395. His tomb is in the crypt of the city's St. Paulinus' Church, which was rededicated to him.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{relation}} between the grain size composition TOC (total organic carbon) concentration was examined by linear and non-linear regression analysis of analytical data for more than 500 sediment samples from the NW Black Sea. A significant dependency of the TOC concentration on the percentages of clay and especially the < 16 μm fraction (clay plus fine and very fine silt) was identified, the model best fitting the analytical data being exponential. Three groups of sediment samples were identified using the K-means clustering technique, the deep sea sediment samples <b>being</b> clearly <b>singled</b> <b>out...</b>|$|R
25|$|On November 14, 2006, Mostafa Tabatabainejad, a fourth-year University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) student, was drive stunned {{multiple}} {{times with a}} Taser by campus police, for allegedly refusing to show his school ID to a fellow student acting as security at the college library Instructional Computing Commons (CLICC) lab at Powell Library during finals week. The police had been called after Tabatabainejad had refused to provide his BruinCard (student ID) to a UCLA Community Service Officer (aka student volunteer). Tabatabainejad felt he was <b>being</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> because of his Middle Eastern ethnicity. A UCLA ID card with magnetic strip is needed {{to enter into the}} Library after hours and therefore it was assumed that all individuals in the library were students and had valid ID cards to gain access. Asking students to show ID was not a common practice and for this reason the student refused to show his ID and instead asked the community officer if he had asked anyone else that evening to show their ID. The community officer threatened to call campus police if he didn't show ID. Tabatabainejad, being confident the campus police would take his side as he felt he was being harassed, invited the community officer to do so. When the campus police arrived they did not ask questions but instead handcuffed Tabatabainejad and attempted to physically remove him from the Library. Tabatabainejad sat on the floor in protest of the way he was being treated at his own University while he was studying for final exams. The campus police then Tasered him five times while his hands were bound behind his back with plastic wrist restraints. Part of the incident was recorded on video by a camera phone and is available for viewing on YouTube.|$|E
500|$|Berger {{was part}} of the Czech Republic team who took part in Euro 1996, <b>being</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> as the only player in the squad with the {{potential}} to become a [...] "major international star". In spite of this, Martin Frýdek was preferred to Berger in the starting lineup for the first match against Germany. Berger went on to play in all of his nation's matches in the tournament, famously scoring in the final from the penalty spot to give the Czech Republic a 1–0 lead against Germany. However, the Czech Republic ultimately lost on the golden goal rule in extra time.|$|E
500|$|Some of the clauses {{addressed}} wider economic issues. The {{concerns of}} the barons over the treatment of their debts to Jewish moneylenders, who occupied a special position in medieval England and were by tradition under the King's protection, were addressed by clauses 10 and 11. The charter concluded this section with the phrase [...] "debts owing to other than Jews shall be dealt with likewise", so it is debatable {{to what extent the}} Jews were <b>being</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> by these clauses. Some issues were relatively specific, such as clause 33 which ordered the removal of all fishing weirs—an important and growing source of revenue at the time—from England's rivers.|$|E

2500|$|Toward {{the end of}} her piece, she writes: “That a {{man with}} a female wit is the worst hermaphrodite.” This is perhaps the most memorable line, as it has been {{interpreted}} by many as a jab at Ben Jonson, who apparently “had a career-long interest in hermaphroditism” according to Foster and Banton as evident by his works Cynthia’s Revels, Volpone, and Epicoene. It is notable, however, that not all agree. Robert W. Halli, Jr. points out that this is only one line of many that is <b>being</b> unfairly <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> and misinterpreted, and scholar Victoria E. White claims “how this [...] is” immediately “relevant to Jonson is not apparent.” ...|$|R

[...] Kim escalated the feud with her mixtape, Black Friday (2011), whose title and artwork mimic Pink Friday; a fragment from Minaj's diss track, [...] "Tragedy", previewed that April.

500|$|During August and September 1987, Echo & the Bunnymen co-headlined {{a tour of}} the United States {{with popular}} {{electronic}} group New Order. Despite the tour passing without incident, the performances were deemed to be of poor quality. Although American audiences were apparently satisfied by the shows, when the group returned to the United Kingdom for an autumn tour the British music press and audiences were not as equally enthusiastic. Shortly thereafter the band announced plans to record a self-produced album of [...] "savage rock" [...] when there was more free time. The group toured the UK and the US again in early 1988. These concerts were more positively received than their tour the previous year, with guitarist Will Sergeant <b>being</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> for praise– BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel said, [...] "Will Sergeant was superb, moving in a trice from squalls of angry sound to playing with such care and subtlety that there were whispered asides from his guitar that I would have sworn only he and I had heard." [...] In March 1988, the band released a cover version of The Doors' song [...] "People Are Strange". However, this failed to impress critics; music paper Melody Maker called it a [...] "rancid effort" [...] and Q said the band had [...] "thrown in the towel".|$|E

5000|$|In April 2012 {{speech at}} Harvard University, Vogue Italia editor Franca Sozzani {{conceded that the}} fashion {{industry}} may be a cause of the recent rise in eating disorders, but that the industry was <b>being</b> unfairly <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> for blame: [...] "How can all this be possibly caused by fashion? And how come that Twiggy, who would be surely considered an anorexic today, did not arise controversy in the Sixties and did not produce a string of anorexia followers?"

500|$|Jardine missed {{most of the}} 1922 season {{owing to}} a serious knee injury; he played only four matches {{at a time when}} he was {{expected}} to make a big impression. He missed the Cambridge match and was unable to play for Surrey that season. Even so, in 1922 he was selected by The Isis as one of its men of the year. After some problems with his troublesome knee, Jardine returned to cricket by May of the 1923 season. He was not given the Oxford captaincy in his final year, which has led to later speculation that his manner and unfriendliness was held against him. However, his injury and the availability of other deserving candidates may have provided some of the explanation. Jardine gradually found his batting form, and contributed to Oxford's only win over Cambridge in the decade. During one innings of another match, he received criticism for using his pads to stop the ball from hitting the wickets: this was within the laws of the game but was controversial and seen by critics to be against the spirit of the game. Christopher Douglas traces Jardine's hostility towards the press and critics to this incident. He also received criticism for his slow batting for Oxford, again <b>being</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> due to his known ability to play attacking shots. Partly this was because Jardine held a responsible position, the team often reliant on his success. The complaints were a manifestation of wider criticism of young amateur batting at the time for its lack of enterprise, as commentators began to hark back to the [...] "golden age" [...] before the war. Jardine left Oxford in 1923 having scored a total of 1,381 runs and was awarded a fourth class degree in modern history.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the praise}} was {{reserved}} for the casting, with Vivien Leigh in particular <b>being</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> for her performance as Scarlett. Nugent described her as the [...] "pivot of the picture" [...] and believed her to be [...] "so perfectly designed for the part by art and nature that any other actress in the role would be inconceivable". Similarly, Hoellering found her [...] "perfect" [...] in [...] "appearance and movements"; he felt her acting best when she was allowed to [...] "accentuate the split personality she portrays" [...] and thought she was particularly effective in such moments of characterization like {{the morning after the}} marital rape scene. Flinn also found Leigh suited to the role physically and felt she was best in the scenes where she displays courage and determination, such as the escape from Atlanta and when Scarlett kills a Yankee deserter. Leigh won in the Best Actress category for her performance at the 1939 New York Film Critics Circle Awards. Of Clark Gable's performance as Rhett Butler, Flinn felt the characterization was [...] "as close to Miss Mitchell's conception—and the audience's—as might be imagined", a view which Nugent concurred with, although Hoellering felt that Gable didn't quite convince in the closing scenes, as Rhett walks out on Scarlett in disgust. Of the other principal cast members, both Hoellering and Flinn found Leslie Howard to be [...] "convincing" [...] as the weak-willed Ashley, with Flinn identifying Olivia de Havilland as a [...] "standout" [...] as Melanie; Nugent was also especially taken with de Havilland's performance, describing it as a [...] "gracious, dignified, tender gem of characterization". Hattie McDaniel's performance as Mammy was singled out for praise by many critics: Nugent believed she gave the best performance in the film after Vivien Leigh, with Flinn placing it third after Leigh's and Gable's performances.|$|E
500|$|After {{finishing}} {{his work on}} Trouble in Mind, Divine again became involved with a John Waters project, the film Hairspray (1988). Set in Baltimore during the 1960s, Hairspray revolved around self-proclaimed [...] "pleasantly plump" [...] teenager Tracy Turnblad as she pursues stardom as a dancer on a local television show and rallies against racial segregation. As he had in Waters's earlier film Female Trouble, Divine took on two roles in the film, {{one of which was}} female and the other male. The first of these, Edna Turnblad, was Tracy's loving mother; Divine would later note that with this character he could not be accurately described as a drag queen, proclaiming [...] "What drag queen would allow herself to look like this? I look like half the women from Baltimore." [...] His second character in the film was that of the racist television station owner Arvin Hodgepile. In one interview, Divine admitted that he had hoped to play both the role of mother and daughter in Hairspray, but that the producers had been [...] "a bit leery" [...] and chose Ricki Lake for the latter role instead. Divine went on to state his opinion on Lake, jokingly telling the interviewer that [...] "She is nineteen and delightful. I hate her." [...] In reality they had become good friends while working together on set. Reviews of the film were predominantly positive, with Divine in particular <b>being</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> for praise; several commentators expressed their opinion that the film marked Divine's breakthrough into mainstream cinema. He subsequently took his mother to the film's premier in the Miami Film Festival before she once more accompanied him to the Baltimore premier, this time also with several of his other relatives. After the screening, a party was held at the Baltimore Museum of Art, where Frances Milstead granted an impromptu interview to the English film critic Jonathan Ross, a friend and fan of Divine's.|$|E

50|$|Gabriel's {{departure}} from Genesis on 15 August 1975—which stunned {{fans of the}} group and left many commentators wondering if the band could survive—was the result of several factors. His stature as the lead singer of the band and the added attention garnered by his flamboyant stage persona led to tensions within the band. Genesis had always operated more or less as a collective, and Gabriel's burgeoning public profile led to fears within the group that he was <b>being</b> unfairly <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> as the creative hub. The band also began to feel confined by the reputation (and fans' expectations) attached to their famously elaborate theatrical performances, believing that the visual element of their performances was receiving more attention than their music.|$|R
