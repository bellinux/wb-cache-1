40|$|ABSTRACT- The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effects of <b>bakery</b> <b>waste</b> inclusion (0; 25; 50; 75 and 100 %, DM basis) in proportion to corn meal in the energetic mixture of the concentrate on intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance and ruminal parameters in sheep. Five male lambs with body weight of 30 kg were used in a 5 × 5 Latin square design. Experimental diets were composed of concentrate and Tifton 85 (Cynodon spp.) hay in a 60 : 40 forage:concentrate ratio. The concentrate rations were composed of corn meal, soybean meal and <b>bakery</b> <b>waste.</b> The bakery waste:corn meal ratio corresponded to the inclusion of, approximately, 0, 7, 14, 22 and 30 % (DM basis) of <b>bakery</b> <b>waste</b> in the diet. There was no effect of <b>bakery</b> <b>waste</b> inclusion on the intake and digestibility of nutrients, nor on nitrogen balance, pH values or concentrations of volatile fatty acids. However, the ammonia nitrogen concentration showed negative linear response in relation to the level of inclusion, in which each increase of 1 % <b>bakery</b> <b>waste</b> promoted reduction of 0. 11 mg/dL in the concentration of ammonia nitrogen. This fact may be related to the increase in ruminal availability of energy, which allows greater use of ammonia for microbial growth. <b>Bakery</b> <b>waste</b> can replace corn meal in concentrate rations for sheep...|$|E

Results demonstrated that <b>bakery</b> <b>waste</b> hydrolysate and seawater could be efficiently utilized by Halomonas boliviensis while PHB contents between 10 and 30 % (w/w) were obtained. Furthermore, three methods for <b>bakery</b> <b>waste</b> hydrolysis were investigated for feedstock preparation. These include: (1) use of crude enzyme extracts from Aspergillus awamori, (2) Aspergillus awamori solid mashes, and (3) commercial glucoamylase. In the first method, the resultant {{free amino nitrogen}} (FAN) concentration in hydrolysates was 150 and 250 [*]mg[*]L− 1 after 20 hours at enzyme-to-solid ratios of 6. 9 and 13. 1 [*]U[*]g− 1, respectively. In both cases, the final glucose concentration was around 130 – 150 [*]g[*]L− 1. In the second method, the resultant FAN and glucose concentrations were 250 [*]mg[*]L− 1 and 150 [*]g[*]L− 1, respectively. In the third method, highest glucose and lowest FAN concentrations of 170 – 200 [*]g[*]L− 1 and 100 [*]mg[*]L− 1, respectively, were obtained in hydrolysates after only 5 hours.

40|$|Using four Zandi sheep, {{digestibility}} and degradability of <b>bakery</b> <b>waste</b> {{and barley}} grain {{were determined by}} in vivo and in situ methods. The digestibility and degradability of <b>bakery</b> <b>waste</b> were 78. 8 and 74. 6 and that of barley grain were 86. 8 and 77. 1 %, respectively. Twenty eight Zandi male lambs were fattened for 85 days with 4 experimental diets composed of 0, 6, 12. 5 and 25 % <b>bakery</b> <b>waste</b> in a completely randomized design. The lambs were slaughtered and the carcass traits, internal fat and tail-fat fatty acid concentration, iodine and saponification indices were determined. The effect of diets on dry matter intake, final live weight, average daily gain, Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR), carcass weight, internal fat weight, fat-tail weight, the palmitic and oleic acid contents of fat-tail and internal fat, saponification index and the fat-tail linoleic acid concentrations were not significant (p> 0. 05). The effect of diets on the internal fat and fat-tail iodine index and internal fat linoleic acid concentrations were significant (p< 0. 05).

In 1987 over 100 municipal composting facilities were in operation in the United States. However, relatively few food processing industries {{have taken advantage of}} this technology. In 1986, International Process Systems introduced a vessel type system {{that can be used for}} the economical and environmentally sound composting of a wide variety of materials. The IPS system opens up many opportunities for the food processing industry to make full use of composting as a waste management technology. This report discusses the results of two full-scale demonstrations of the successful composting of residuals from the production of (1) apple juice and (2) chocolate. A total of 127 wet tons of apple wastes (pomace, filter cake, and a biological sludge) were composted in the first study. In the second study, 8 wet tons of chocolate <b>waste</b> (expeller cake, <b>bakery</b> <b>wastes,</b> and a biological sludge) were processed. Sawdust was added to the waste mixtures in order to obtain an input mixture with adequate porosity and moisture for composting.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to compare the efficacy of different level of <b>bakery</b> <b>waste</b> in the broiler ration. The experiment was carried out for 42 days (6 weeks) on 180 broiler chicks. Up to 3 weeks of age {{there was no significant}} difference in body weight gain of different treatment groups. However from 4 th to 6 th week the gain in body weight in the group maintained on diet, in which 60 % maize was replace by <b>bakery</b> <b>waste</b> was significantly lower as compare to basal diet 20 % replacement and and 40 % replacement. The gain in these three groups was comparable. During 1 st, 3 rd and 4 th week the FCR in T 1, T 2 T 3 was significantly better than T 4 group. From 4 th to 6 th week of age, FCR of basal diet was significantly better than the other groups. The FCR for birds feed with 20 % and 40 % replaced diet was significantly better than the birds feed on 60 % replaced diet. The replacement of maize with <b>bakery</b> <b>waste</b> has resulted to lower margin of profit markedly in T 4 group.

Thermochemical processes (e.g. pyrolysis and in-situ upgrading) can also set the basis to a more sustainable production of biofuels and biosyngas from a range of food waste derived feedstocks [10, 11] and biodiesel has been reported to be produced from coffee waste grounds by simple methodologies [12, 13]. Such advanced food waste valorisation practices are of increasing industrial interest as traditional feedstocks and chemicals derived therefrom become more scarce, expensive and environmentally unacceptable.

40|$|Uncertainty about {{anaerobic}} digestion process stability {{is the main}} issue preventing more widespread use of the process {{as a source of}} energy recovery in wastewater treatment facilities. The overall objective of this research was to study the feasibility of enhancing biogas production inside wastewater facilities using co-digestion of municipal sludge with <b>bakery</b> <b>waste.</b> Another objective was to improve the stability index and a mathematical model that can be useful tools to predict the process stability of municipal sludge digestion alone, and when it is mixed with <b>bakery</b> <b>waste,</b> as a substrate for microorganisms. Experiments were conducted in three phases. In phase 1, a full-scale anaerobic digester at Central Weber Sewer Improvement District, Ogden, UT, receiving a mixture of primary and secondary sludge, was monitored for one hundred days. Chemical oxygen demand (COD), and volatile solids (VS) mass balances were conducted to evaluate the stability of the digester and its capability of producing methane gas. The COD mass balance accounted for nearly 90 % of the methane gas produced while the VS mass balance showed that 91 % of the organic matter removed resulted in biogas formation. Other parameters monitored included: pH, alkalinity, VFA, and propionic acid. The values of these parameters showed that the digester was running under stable steady state conditions. At mesophilic temperature, the stability index was determined and equal to 0. 40 L (CH 4) / g(ΔVS) In phase 2, the feasibility of adding BW to MS was tested in batch reactors scale. The biogas production was enhanced and the digester was stable until the range of 37 - 40 % of BW to 63 - 60 % of MS. The ADM 1 coefficients were modified to accurately predict the digester performance. The modified model outputs (pH, VFA, and methane) were within acceptable ranges when compared with the observed data from the batch reactors. In phase 3, the feasibility of MS and BW were tested using an Induced Bed Reactor (IBR) with a 50 : 50 % ratio of MS:BW (COD basis).

As <b>bakery</b> <b>waste</b> was used waste bread that came from coffee-house “Zastávka”. Bread was pre-treated by grinding into small particles and then it was made to form 15 % w/v suspension, which was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis. For the hydrolysis has been used the -amylase for liquefaction of the substrate and that was followed by a glucoamylase which sacharificated the substrate. There have been several methods of hydrolysis from which was chosen the optimal method for pre-treatment of the substrate prior to fermentation. The effectivity and a process of hydrolysis were determined spectrophotometrically by Somogyi-Nelson method. Final yields of glucose from hydrolysis were determined by HPLC method. Enzymatic hydrolysis was followed by fermentation, which was carried out in two ways, namely by adjusting the pH of the hydrolyzate to pH 5, and without pH adjustment. During the fermentation was carried out sampling in which was determined the content of glucose, glycerol and ethanol by HPLC method. The yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used for the fermentation which was performed at 30 °C.

The suitability of the organic rich waste depends {{on its ability to}} produce biogas as well as its influence on the overall anaerobic digestion process. Biomethane potential evaluation was conducted to screen seven organic wastes and dehydrated algae. All co-substrates increased the bio-methane yield by three to six times compared with conventional anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge. Maximum co-digestion ratios were identifiable for most solid co-substrates including algae (6 % wt/wt), undiluted food waste (5 % wt/wt), <b>bakery</b> <b>waste</b> (5 % wt/wt), and diluted commercial food waste (10 % wt/wt). On the other hand, the maximum co-digestions ratio of beverage reject and sewage sludge was 10 % (wt/wt). With the exception of fat-oil-grease, all solids free liquid co-substrates evaluated in this study showed a notable synergistic effect, to enhanced removals of total solids, volatile solids (VS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) during anaerobic digestion. The increase in COD removal when co-digesting wastewater sludge and liquid waste was from 2 to 41 %. Conversely, the co-digestion of most solid co-substrates resulted in additional VS and COD residuals in the final biosolids. Elevated concentrations of sulphur and phosphorous in all food waste co-substrates suggest that control measures to address H 2 S in biogas and the accumulation of phosphorus in sludge centrate may be necessary during full scale operation.

40|$|In {{brackish}} groundwater desalination, high recovery ratio (of {{fresh water}} from saline feed) is desired to minimise concentrate reject. To this effect, {{previous studies have}} developed a batch reverse osmosis (RO) desalination system, DesaLink, which proposed to expand steam in a reciprocating piston cylinder and transmit the driving force through a linkage crank mechanism to pressurise batches of saline water (recirculating) in a water piston cylinder unto RO membranes. However, steam is largely disadvantaged at operation from low temperature (< 150 oC) thermal sources; and organic working fluids are more viable, though, the obtainable thermal cycle efficiencies are generally low with low temperatures. Consequently, this thesis proposed to investigate the use of organic working fluid Rankine cycle (ORC) with isothermal expansion, to drive the DesaLink machine, at improved thermal efficiency from low temperature thermal sources. Following {{a review of the}} methods of achieving isothermal expansion, ‘liquid flooded expansion’ and ‘expansion chamber surface heating’ were identified as potential alternative methods. Preliminary experimental comparative analysis of variants of the heated expansion chamber technique of effecting isothermal expansion favoured a heated plain wall technique, and as such was adopted for further optimisation and development. Further, an optimised isothermal ORC engine was built and tested at < 95 oC heat source temperature, with R 245 fa working fluid – which was selected from 16 working fluids that were analysed for isothermal operation. Upon satisfactory performance of the test engine, a larger (10 times) version was built and coupled to drive the DesaLink system. Operating the integrated ORC-RO DesaLink system, gave freshwater (approximately 500 ppm) production of about 12 litres per hour (from 4000 ppm feed water) at a recovery ratio of about 0. 7 and specific energy consumption of 0. 34 kWh/m 3; and at a thermal efficiency of 7. 7 %. Theoretical models characterising the operation and performance of the integrated system was developed and utilised to access the potential field performance of the system, when powered by two different thermal energy sources – solar and industrial <b>bakery</b> <b>waste</b> heat – as case studies...|$|E
40|$|A {{dedicated}} cell-line {{was developed}} by the Department of Toxicology of Wageningen University in a joined project with the University of California in Davis and the RIKILT-WUR - Institute of Food Safety in Wageningen. This DR-CALUX ® bioassay was tested, optimised and validated for its use to determine low elevated levels of dioxins in bovine milk around the existing limits. It was shown that this mammalian cell based test is very sensitive for 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted dioxins and related PCBs, thereby reflecting the relative potencies (TEF) of these compounds as set by the World Health Organisation (WHO). These toxic equivalency factors (WHO-TEFs) express the toxicity of a compound in comparison to the most toxic compound congener 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, TEF= 1). The response obtained with a mixture of dioxins was additive, in accordance with the TEQ-principle. Milk fat was isolated by centrifugation followed by clean-up of the fat with n-pentane, removal of the fat on a 33 % H 2 SO 4 silica column, and determination of Ah receptor agonist activity with the DR-CALUX ® bioassay. To investigate the performance of this 33 % H 2 SO 4 silica method, milk fat was cleaned with activated carbon and spiked with a mixture of 17 different 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted PCDD and PCDF congeners at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 pg WHO-TEQ per g fat, as confirmed by GC/MS. In this concentration range, the method showed a recovery of TEQs around 67 % (58 - 87 %). The reproducibility showed a coefficient of variation (CV) varying between 4 % and 54 %, {{with the exception of the}} sample spiked at 1 pg WHO-TEQ/g (CV 97 %). The repeatability determined with the sample spiked at 6 pg WHO-TEQ per g showed a CV of 10 % These results clearly demonstrate that the reproducibility of the silica-CALUX procedure with samples containing more than 1 pg WHO-TEQ per g fat is relatively good, in particular regarding the fact that no internal standards could be used in the assay for correction of data for varying recoveries. The fact that the CV was much higher for the sample spiked at the lowest level, confirmed the calculated limit of quantification of 1 pg WHO-TEQ per g fat. The current tolerance limit for bovine milk in the EU is 3 pg WHO-TEQ per g fat, with an action limit of 2 pg WHO-TEQ per g fat. Therefore, the DR-CALUX ® bioassay can be a useful pre-screening tool for selecting milk samples that may contain dioxin levels exceeding this tolerance limit. This was supported by the results obtained with 22 field samples, since all five samples exceeding the 2 pg WHO-TEQ per g fat concentration gave a higher response in the DR-CALUX ® bioassay. The DR-CALUX ® bioassay in combination with the 33 % H 2 SO 4 clean-up procedure results in a specific test for the determination of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, allowing the screening of relatively large sets of samples for the presence of unacceptable high levels of these compounds. This results in a reduction of costs involved in the analysis of food for the presence of these compounds, enabling more intense monitoring programs. Following the successful optimisation and validation of the test for milk fat, the bioassay was first used at RIKILT in the food and feed area during the 1998 Brazilian citrus pulp incident. The test procedure was subsequently optimised and validated for animal feed. During the German <b>bakery</b> <b>waste</b> incident in 2003, animal feed was contaminated with dioxins due to the use of waste wood for drying of the material. Besides Germany, the material was also shipped to the Netherlands. Levels up to 12 ng WHO-TEQ/kg were detected, being about 15 times over the current limit of 0. 75 ng WHO-TEQ/kg. A combined strategy of screening with the DR CALUX ® -bioassay and the HRGC/HRMS confirmatory method was used in the Netherlands to rapidly control the incident. Pigs were contaminated by the incident but only to a very limited extent. Despite the rather low limits for pig meat (1 pg WHO-TEQ per g fat), the DR-CALUX ® bioassay, in combination with an extra acid pre-treatment of the fat samples, showed excellent performance, confirming once again the value of this bioassay. Shown during the recent incidents with kaolinic clay (2004) and the contaminated HCl used for gelatine production (2006), the assay is still the best available screening test for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. The second aim of the research in this thesis was to develop, validate and apply a new recombinant yeast screen to detect chemicals with an estrogenic mode of action in animal feed, urine and illegal preparations. A recombinant yeast cell that stably expresses the human estrogen receptor α (hERα) and yeast enhanced green fluorescent protein (yEGFP) as a reporter protein in response to estrogens was developed at the RIKILT. The EC 50 revealed by the RIKILT yeast Estrogen bioAssay (REA) was 0. 5 nM for 17 b-estradiol and was comparable with reported EC 50 values for yeast estrogen bioassays that contain β-galactosidase as a reporter. However, the yEGFP assay can be performed completely in 96 well plates within 4 hours and does not need require cell wall disruption, nor does it need the addition of a substrate. This makes the test sensitive, rapid and convenient with high reproducibility and small variation. The robustness and ease of the yeast cells in combination with the qualities of yEGFP, ensure that the assay will be suited to be used as a high through put system. The properties of the RIKILT yeast Estrogen bioAssay expressing the hERα (REA) were further studied by testing a series of estrogenic compounds. In addition, a similar assay was developed based on the stable expression of human estrogen receptor β (hERβ). When exposed to 17 b-estradiol, the maximum transcriptional activity of the hERb cytosensor was only about 40 % of the activity observed with hERa, but the concentration where half-maximal activation is reached (EC 50), was about 5 times lower. The relative estrogenic potencies (REP), defined as the ratio between the EC 50 of 17 b-estradiol and the EC 50 of the compound, of the synthetic hormones dienestrol, hexestrol and especially mestranol were higher with ERa than with ERβ, while DES was slightly more potent with ERb. The gestagens progesterone and medroxyprogesterone-acetate showed no response, whereas the androgen testosterone showed a very weak response and only at high concentrations. The isoflavones genistein, genistin, daidzein and daidzin, the coumestran coumestrol and the flavonoid naringenin were relatively more potent with ERb than with ERa. Coumestrol and genistein were by far the most potent of these compounds with ERb. However, 8 -prenylnaringenin, a phytoestrogen present in hops, was relatively more potent with ERa than with ERb and was actually the most potent phytoestrogen with ERa. The data demonstrate that the REA shows clear dose-response curves when exposed to estrogenic compounds. Since good dose-response curves can be obtained after only 4 h of exposure, the often questioned permeability of the yeast cell wall does not seem to be an obstacle in our yeast estrogen bioassays. The RIKILT yeast Estrogen bioAssay stably expressing human estrogen receptor α (REA) was validated as a qualitative screening method for the determination of estrogenic activity in calf urine and animal feed. These validations were performed according to EC Decision 2002 / 657, which prescribes the determination of the detection capability (CCb), the specificity and the stability. To determine these performance characteristics, twenty blank urine samples of 19 week old calves were collected and spiked with 17 b-estradiol (E 2 b) at 1 ng/ml- 1, diethylstilbestrol (DES) at 1 ng/ml- 1, 17 a-ethynylestradiol (EE 2) at 1 ngml- 1 a-zearalanol at 50 ngml- 1 or mestranol at 10 ng/ml- 1. Following enzymatic deconjugation and solid phase extraction, 100 ml equivalents of these blank and spiked urine samples were screened for estrogenic activity in a 96 well plate using the REA. All of these blank and low estrogen spiked feed samples fulfilled the CCα and CCβ criterions, meaning that all 20 blank urine samples gave a signal below the determined decision limit CCα and were thus classified as compliant and at least 19 out of the 20 spiked samples gave a signal above this CCα (β= 5 %) and were thus classified as suspect. The specificity of the method was determined with blank urine samples spiked with a high dose of testosterone or progesterone (1000 ng/ml- 1). No response to these substances was detected in the REA. There was also no interference of a high dose of testosterone or progesterone on the response of a low dose of the estrogens. Stability of urine samples was checked with spiked urine samples that were kept frozen for up to 90 days, showing that urine samples could be stored at - 20 °C for up to 60 days without changing the screening result of the assay. The assay was validated for animal feed in a simalar way, using twenty blank animal feed samples, including milk replacers and wet and dry feed samples. As all the performance characteristics met the criteria that were put forward in EC Decision 2002 / 657 for validation of a qualitative screening method, the described clean-up/yeast estrogen bioassay procedures were proven to be valid for the determination of estrogenic activity in calf urine and animal feed. The clean-up procedures for urine and feed samples are relatively simple and the yeast estrogen bioassay, using yEGFP as a reporter protein, is sensitive, rapid, convenient and reproducible. Due to the good sensitivity of the bioassay, only 2 ml of urine or 1 gram of feed were enough to be processed. Combined this resulted in a low cost bioassay that is suited to be used as a high through-put system for the screening of estrogenic activity in calf urine and animal feed. Like the DR CALUX ® assay, Tthe method acquired an ISO 17025 accreditation status in the Netherlands for both of these matrices. The examples of the MPA-incident with wet pig feed and the fish feed, described in Chapter 7 of the thesis, demonstrate the applicability of the bioassay method as an early warning system for pharmaceutical waste and hormone use respectively. This is the first successful example of a developed, validated and applied bioassay for the screening of hormonal substances in feed. At present this method has been in routine use at RIKILT for more than two years. Overall the work presented in this thesis shows that bioassays are valuable tools for rapid and high throughput screening of samples for both known and unknown compounds. As such they may contribute to an earlier detection of new emerging risks and prevent the use of illegal growth-promoting agents with thus far unknown identity...|$|E
