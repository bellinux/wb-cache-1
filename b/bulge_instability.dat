40|$|This report {{describes}} the rheological analysisof the present Ag nanoparticle ink, and confirms {{that it is}} suitable for the piezoelectric drop-on-demand printing for both of 1 pL and 10 pL cartridges. The satellite drops and the splashing on the substrate are also discussed for optimization of the nozzle temperature and the jetting voltage. The minimum horizontal and vertical line widths are shown to be 30 and 40 µm, respectively, but the average minimum single line width {{is estimated to be}} ~ 50 µm. The non-uniform width lines are suggested to arise from the <b>bulge</b> <b>instability.</b> Furthermore, it is indicated that the surface roughness of the PI film causes the non-parallel contact line pinning. The resistivity of printed lines is also reported...|$|E
40|$|The {{currently}} discussed {{theories of}} bulge formation are reviewed, including the primordial scenario, where bulges form rapidly and then accrete disks, the secular scenario, where bulges are formed by dynamical evolution of disks through bars and galaxy interactions, and some combinations of both, where formation of bulges and disks are more continuous and interleaved. The various scenarios make specific {{predictions about the}} relative masses, angular momenta, colours, metallicities of bulges relative to disks, and the bulge-to-disk ratio {{as a function of}} time. Dynamical processes relevant to the formation of <b>bulges</b> (bar <b>instabilities,</b> mergers) are described and tested against observed statistics. Current data suggest a dynamical feedback from gravitational <b>instabilities</b> in <b>bulge</b> and disk formation. It is very difficult to discriminate between the various scenarios from surveys at z = 0 only, and observations at high redshift are presently the best hope for large progress. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With {{attention}} {{concentrated on}} the pole of <b>bulge</b> profile, tensile <b>instability</b> which results in the fracture of forward acting rupture discs has been studied. A formula was developed to calculate the theoretical limit pressure of rupture discs, and the theoretical predictions were compared with the measured data. It is found that the strain-hardening exponent of sheet metals has no influence on the limit pressure, whereas the limit pressure is {{in direct proportion to}} the strength coefficient of sheet metals. It is important to realize that the strength coefficient of sheet metals can be acquired easily from the limit pressure. This has potential value for the tests of mechanical properties of sheet metals...|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} a simple prescription based on hydrodynamical simulations {{to predict the}} effective radii and velocity dispersions of early-type galaxies. We apply this prescription to a semi-analytic model, allowing for bulge formation via major and minor mergers as well as disk instabilities. We find {{that it is necessary}} to include disk instabilities in the model to reproduce the mass function of early-type galaxies, and that galaxies that form <b>bulges</b> via disk <b>instability</b> tend to form bulges earlier. This model is able to reproduce the low-redshift size-mass and Fundamental Plane relations. It predicts a degree of curvature in the Faber-Jackson relation that is not seen in local observations, but this could be offset if higher mass spheroids have more bottom-heavy initial mass functions. The model is also able to match the observed rapid evolution of the size-mass relation out to higher redshifts, as well as the slower evolution in the normalization of the Faber-Jackson relation...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{terraces}} {{are often}} subject to degradation {{issues related to}} water movement. A {{better understanding of the}} main hydrological processes that govern surface and subsurface water flow pathways and that are responsible for terrace failure and dry-stone wall collapse is essential for appropriate water resource management and rural landscape maintenance in terraced areas. However, a clear conceptualization of different hydrological functioning related to wall instability issues is still missing. In this study, we monitored a terrace system in a hilly site of central Italy cultivated with vineyards. We adopted a multidisciplinary approach based on soil analysis, different geophysical techniques, hydrological monitoring, high-resolution grid terrain analysis and field experiments (infiltration and flooding tests) aiming to: (i) obtain new information of terrace soil and subsoil structure; (ii) test the hypothesis on wall instability based on the formation of preferential flow and water accumulation behind the wall; and (iii) develop a conceptual model of water circulation in agricultural terraces. Our results indicate that terrace soil was highly heterogeneous, including discontinuities and piping systems that facilitated a rapid infiltration and the development of fast subsurface flow. Groundwater rise did not occur, as observed in other terraced sites, but infiltrated water accumulated behind dry-stone walls, increasing pore water pressure and inducing wall <b>bulging</b> and <b>instability.</b> Our findings provided new field evidences of water circulation and led to the definition of a novel paradigm of hydrological functioning of farming terraced systems for addressing more efficient management and maintenance issues in these vulnerable landscapes.

40|$|We present {{observations}} of pseudobulges in S 0 and spiral galaxies using imaging data {{taken with the}} Spitzer Infra-Red Array Camera. We have used 2 -d bulge-disk-bar decomposition to determine structural parameters of 185 S 0 galaxies and 31 nearby spiral galaxies. Using the Sersic index and the position on the Kormendy diagram to classify their bulges as either classical or pseudo, we find that 25 S 0 s (14 %) and 24 spirals (77 %) host pseudoblges. The fraction of pseudobulges we find in spiral galaxies {{is consistent with previous}} results obtained with optical data and show that the evolution of a large fraction of spirals is governed by secular processes rather than by major mergers. We find that the bulge effective radius is correlated with the disk scale length for pseudobulges of S 0 s and spirals, as expected for secular formation of <b>bulges</b> from disk <b>instabilities,</b> though the disks in S 0 s are significantly smaller than those in spirals. We show that early-type pseudobulge hosting spirals can transform to pseudobulge hosting S 0 s by simple gas stripping. However, simple gas stripping mechanism is not sufficient to transform the late-type pseudobulge hosting spirals into pseudobulge hosting S 0 s.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{kinematic}} results from our ARGOS spectroscopic {{survey of the}} Galactic bulge of the Milky Way. Our aim is to understand {{the formation of the}} Galactic bulge. We examine the kinematics of about 17, 400 stars in the bulge located within 3. 5 kpc of the Galactic centre, identified from the 28, 000 star ARGOS survey. We aim to determine if the formation of the bulge has been internally driven from disk instabilities as suggested by its boxy shape, or if mergers have played a significant role as expected from Lambda CDM simulations. From our velocity measurements across latitudes b = - 5 deg, - 7. 5 deg and - 10 deg we find the bulge to be a cylindrically rotating system that transitions smoothly out into the disk. Within the bulge, we find a kinematically distinct metal-poor population ([Fe/H] < - 1. 0) that is not rotating cylindrically. The 5 % of our stars with [Fe/H] < - 1. 0 are a slowly rotating spheroidal population, which we believe are stars of the metal weak thick disk and halo which presently lie in the inner Galaxy. The kinematics of the two bulge components that we identified in ARGOS paper III (mean [Fe/H] = - 0. 25 and [Fe/H] = + 0. 15, respectively) demonstrate that they are likely to share a common formation origin and are distinct from the more metal poor populations of the thick disk and halo which are colocated inside the bulge. We do not exclude an underlying merger generated bulge component but our results favour <b>bulge</b> formation from <b>instabilities</b> in the early thin disk.

40|$|Rapid {{accretion}} of cold gas plays {{a crucial}} role in getting gas into galaxies. It has been suggested that this accretion proceeds along narrow streams that might also directly drive the turbulence in galactic gas, dynamical disturbances, and bulge formation. In cosmological simulations, however, it is impossible to isolate and hence disentangle the effect of accretion from internal instabilities and mergers. Moreover, in most cosmological simulations, the phase structure and turbulence in the ISM arising from stellar feedback are treated in a sub-grid manner, so that feedback cannot generate ISM turbulence. In this paper we therefore test the effects of cold streams in extremely high-resolution simulations of otherwise isolated galaxy disks using detailed models for star formation and feedback; we then include or exclude mock cold flows falling onto the galaxies with accretion rates, velocities and geometry set to maximize their effect on the disk. We find: (1) Turbulent velocity dispersions in gas disks are identical with or without the cold flow; the energy injected by the flow is dissipated where it meets the disk. (2) In runs without stellar feedback, the presence of a cold flow has essentially no effect on runaway local collapse, resulting in star formation rates (SFRs) that are far too large. (3) Disks in runs with feedback and cold flows have higher SFRs, but only insofar as they have more gas. (4) Because flows are extended relative to the disk, they do not trigger strong resonant responses and so induce weak morphological perturbation (<b>bulge</b> formation via <b>instabilities</b> is not accelerated). (5) However, flows can thicken the disk by direct contribution of out-of-plane streams. We conclude that while inflows are critical over cosmological timescales to determine the supply and angular momentum of gas disks, they have weak instantaneous dynamical effects on galaxies.

40|$|We analyse the {{spatially}} resolved colours {{of distant}} galaxies of known redshift in the Hubble Deep Field, {{using a new}} technique based on matching resolved four-band internal colour data to the predictions of evolutionary synthesis models. We quantify the relative age, dispersion in age, ongoing star-formation rate, star-formation history, and dust content of these galaxies. To demonstrate {{the potential of the}} method, we study the near-complete sample of 32 I ~ 0. 5 studied by Bouwens et al (1997). The dispersion of the internal colours of a sample of 0. 4 <z< 1 early-type field galaxies in the HDF indicates that ~ 40 % [4 / 11] show evidence of star formation which must have occurred within the past third of their ages at the epoch of observation. For a sample of well-defined spirals, we similarly exploit the dispersion in colour to analyse the relative histories of bulge and disc stars, in order to resolve the current controversy regarding the ages of galactic bulges. Dust and metallicity gradients are ruled out as major contributors to the colour dispersions we observe in these systems. The median ages of bulge stars are found to be signicantly older than those in galactic discs, and exhibit markedly different star-formation histories. This result is inconsistent with a secular growth of <b>bulges</b> from disc <b>instabilities,</b> but consistent with gradual disc formation by accretion of gas onto bulges, as predicted by hierarchical theories. We extend our technique in order to discuss the star formation history of the entire Bouwens et al sample in the context of earlier studies concerned with global star formation histories.
