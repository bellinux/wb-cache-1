Through a careful combination of per-connection queueing and approximate sorting, the shaper performs a small, bounded number of operations in response to each arrival and departure, independent of the number of connections and cells. When the shaper must handle a wide range of rate parameters, a hierarchical arbitration scheme can reduce the implementa [...] ...|$|R
