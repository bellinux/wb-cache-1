50|$|In an {{expansion}} of their research on adult neurogenesis, the laboratory of Zupanc discovered the first vertebrate organism that lacks any {{of the hallmarks of}} <b>brain</b> <b>senescence</b> common to humans and all mammalian species examined thus far. In contrast to the latter, brown ghost knifefish (Apteronotus leptorhynchus) do not exhibit any significant age-related decline in stem/progenitor cell proliferation, neuronal and glial differentiation, or long-term survival of newly generated cells. The availability of this first vertebrate model of ‘negligible senescence’ provides unprecedented opportunities for {{a better understanding of the}} biology of aging and of the cellular mechanisms that protect brains from senescing.|$|E
40|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>senescence</b> is {{as obvious}} as death. It is {{associated}} with structural as well as functional compromises of the brain. Decline in cognitive function can also be associated with aging brain. Both genomics and proteomics study of the aging brain should help in deciphering the process of senescence. Results from this kind of “omics” studies, mainly proteomics, reveal that {{there is always a}} correlation of <b>brain</b> <b>senescence</b> with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), though successful aging without neurodegeneration is possible. Changes at the proteome level can reflect normal aging to mild cognitive impairment to a neurodegenerative disease like AD. Some additional factors are also identified which can enhance or reduce the senescence process. This article is a brief account of those and a mandate towards what could be done to understand the mechanism of brain aging and its correlation with neurodegeneration...|$|E

We report that the heavily ubiquitinilated deposits can be consistently detected by immunohistochemistry in the normal senescent brain. Immunostaining of hippocampal sections from aged brains with an anti-ubiquitin antibody was unrelated to neurofibrillary degeneration or senile plaque formation. In contrast, ubiquitin deposits were not detectable in brain sections from neurologically and neuropathologically normal young individuals who had died of nonneurological causes.

The APPsw/Tg 2576 mice exhibit age-related deterioration in memory and learning {{as well as}} amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, and this mouse strain is considered an effective model for studying the mechanism of accelerated <b>brain</b> aging and <b>senescence.</b> The present study was aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of dietary supplements pomegranate, figs, or the dates on suppressing inflammatory cytokines in APPsw/Tg 2576 mice. Changes in the plasma cytokines and Aβ, ATP, and inflammatory cytokines were investigated in the brain of transgenic mice. Significantly enhanced levels of inflammatory cytokines IL- 1 β, IL- 2, IL- 3, IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 6, IL- 9, IL- 10, TNF-α and Eotaxin activity were decreased by administration of the diet supplements containing pomegranates, figs, or dates. In addition, putative delays {{in the formation of}} senile plaques, as indicated by a decreasing tendency of brain Aβ 1 - 40 and Aβ 1 - 42 contents, were observed. Thus, novel results mediated by reducing inflammatory cytokines during aging may represent one mechanism by which these supplements exert their beneficial effects against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. 17 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{present study}} explores the {{influence}} of the host’s age and gender upon the inflammatory infiltrate. We aimed to quantify the inflammatory infiltrate caused by cysticercosis, which is related to aging, in the heart and in the encephalon. Methods. 75 autopsy protocols with cysticercosis diagnosis from department of pathology at a university hospital from 1970 to 2008 were reviewed. Two groups were formed: elderly with cysticercosis and nonelderly with cysticercosis. We used KS- 300 (Kontron-Zeiss) software for morphometric analysis of the inflammation. Results. The elderly had an average of 3. 1 ± 2. 5 cysticerci, whereas the non-elderly had 2. 7 ± 3. 8 parasites. The non-elderly group with cysticercosis had significantly more inflammation, both cardiac and encephalic, than the elderly group. The elderly females with cysticercosis had more cardiac and encephalic inflammation. Conclusions. In this study, we showed that the non-elderly had significantly more cardiac and encephalic inflammation than the elderly, and that such inflammatory infiltrate decreases with age and depends upon the evolutionary stage of the cysticercus. Furthermore, there are differences concerning gender in the intensity of the inflammatory response due to cysticerci in the heart and <b>brain</b> parenchyma during <b>senescence.</b> Even during this period, women continue to have a more intense response to the parasitosis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Age {{changes in}} {{expression}} of inflammatory, synaptic, and neurotrophic genes {{are not well}} characterized during human <b>brain</b> development and <b>senescence.</b> Knowing these changes may elucidate structural, metabolic, and functional brain processes over the lifespan, as well vulnerability to neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases. Hypothesis: Expression levels of inflammatory, synaptic, and neurotrophic genes in the human brain are coordinated over the lifespan and underlie changes in phenotypic networks or cascades. Methods:We used a large-scale microarray dataset from human prefrontal cortex, BrainCloud, to quantify age changes over the lifespan, divided into Development (0 to 21 years, 87 brains) and Aging (22 to 78 years, 144 brains) intervals, in transcription levels of 39 genes. Results: Gene expression levels followed different trajectories over the lifespan. Many changes were intercorrelated within three similar groups or clusters of genes during both Development and Aging, despite different roles of the gene products in the two intervals. During Development, changes were related to reported neuronal loss, dendritic growth and pruning, and microglial events; TLR 4, IL 1 R 1, NFKB 1, MOBP, PLA 2 G 4 A, and PTGS 2 expression increased {{in the first years}} of life, while expression of synaptic genes GAP 43 and DBN 1 decreased, before reaching plateaus.

40|$|Finch and Sapolsky {{propose that}} the slow {{development}} of human infants and their consequent long period of de-pendency on their parents have favored the evolution of genes that retard <b>brain</b> <b>senescence,</b> specifically recently evolved variants of the apolipoprotein E gene.

40|$|AbstractChronic medical {{conditions}} and/or their treatments may interact with aging to alter or even accelerate <b>brain</b> <b>senescence.</b> Adult onset cancer, for example, {{is a disease}} associated with advanced aging and emerging evidence suggests a profile of subtle but diffuse brain injury following cancer chemotherapy. Breast cancer is currently the primary model for studying these “chemobrain” effects. Given the widespread changes to brain structure and function {{as well as the}} common impairment of integrated cognitive skills observed following breast cancer chemotherapy, it is likely that large-scale brain networks are involved. Default mode network (DMN) is a strong candidate considering its preferential vulnerability to aging and sensitivity to toxicity and disease states. Additionally, chemotherapy is associated with several physiological effects including increased inflammation and oxidative stress that are believed to elevate toxicity in the DMN. Biomarkers of DMN connectivity could aid in the development of treatments for chemotherapy-related cognitive decline...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} soybean {{extracts}} were investigated in senescence-accelerated (SAMP 10) mice, a mouse model of <b>brain</b> <b>senescence</b> with cognitive dysfunction. Mature soybeans are usually yellow. However, the green soybean retains green color after being ripened. Cognitive functions were significantly better-preserved in aged mice fed green soybean than age-matched control mice {{with or without}} yellow soybean feeding. Molecular mechanisms of the beneficial effect of green soybean on brain functions were examined through transcriptome analysis of SAMP 10 hippocampus. The high expression of Ptgds {{was significantly associated with}} green soybean diet, which encodes lipocalin-type prostaglandin D 2 synthase, a putative endogenous amyloid β(Αβ) -chaperone. In consonance, Aplp 1 expression was significantly reduced, a member of amyloid precursor proteins. Furthermore, the amount of Aβ 40 and 42 was reduced in the insoluble fraction of cerebral cortex. These results suggest that the intake of green soybean ameliorates cognitive dysfunction of aged mice through the reduction of Aβ accumulation...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} mitochondrial bioenergetic deficits {{in the female}} <b>brain</b> accompanied reproductive <b>senescence</b> and {{was accompanied by a}} shift from an aerobic glycolytic to a ketogenic phenotype. Herein, we investigated the relationship between systems of fuel supply, transport and mitochondrial metabolic enzyme expression/activity during aging (3 – 15 months) in the hippocampus of nontransgenic (nonTg) background and 3 xTgAD female mice. Results indicate that during female brain aging, both nonTg and 3 xTgAD brains undergo significant decline in glucose transport, as detected by FDG-microPET, between 6 – 9 months of age just prior to the transition into reproductive senescence. The deficit in brain metabolism was sustained thereafter. Decline in glucose transport coincided with significant decline in neuronal glucose transporter expression and hexokinase activity with a concomitant rise in phosphorylated/inactivated pyruvate dehydrogenase. Lactate utilization declined in parallel to the decline in glucose transport suggesting lactate did not serve as an alternative fuel. An adaptive response in the nonTg hippocampus was a shift to transport and utilization of ketone bodies as an alternative fuel. In the 3 xTgAD brain, utilization of ketone bodies as an alternative fuel was evident at the earliest age investigated and declined thereafter. The 3 xTgAD adaptive response was to substantially increase monocarboxylate transporters in neurons while decreasing their expression at the BBB and in astrocytes. Collectively, these data indicate that the earliest change in the metabolic system of the aging female brain is the decline in neurona...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThere is no {{consensus}} in literature about lifespan <b>brain</b> maturation and <b>senescence,</b> mainly because previous lifespan studies have been performed on restricted age periods and/or with {{a limited number of}} scans, making results instable and their comparison very difficult. Moreover, the use of non-harmonized tools and different volumetric measurements lead to a great discrepancy in reported results. Thanks to the new paradigm of BigData sharing in neuroimaging and the last advances in image processing enabling to process baby as well as elderly scans with the same tool, new insights on brain maturation and aging can be obtained. This study presents brain volume trajectory over the entire lifespan using the largest age range to date (from few months of life to elderly) and one of the largest number of subjects (N= 2944). First, we found that white matter trajectory based on absolute and normalized volumes follows an inverted U-shape with a maturation peak around middle life. Second, we found that from 1 to 8 - 10 y there is an absolute gray matter (GM) increase related to body growth followed by a GM decrease. However, when normalized volumes were considered, GM continuously decreases all along the life. Finally, we found that this observation holds for almost all the considered subcortical structures except for amygdala which is rather stable and hippocampus which exhibits an inverted U-shape with a longer maturation period. By revealing the entire brain trajectory picture, a consensus can be drawn since most of the previously discussed discrepancies can be explained...|$|R

Coordinated changes in gene transcription cascades underlie changes in synaptic, neurotrophic, and inflammatory phenotypic networks during brain Development and Aging. Early postnatal expression changes relate to neuronal, glial, and myelin growth and synaptic pruning events, while late Aging is associated with pro-inflammatory and synaptic loss changes.

40|$|Angiogenesis {{represents}} {{a form of}} neovascularisation of exceptional importance in numerous pathological conditions including stroke. In this context it {{is directly related to}} neuroregeneration which is seen in close proximity. However, numerous experimental data have been drawn from studies that have ignored the age criterion. This is extremely important as angiogenesis is different in young versus old subjects. Extrapolating data obtained from studies performed in young subjects or "in vitro" to old-age patients could lead to inexact conclusions since the dynamics of angiogenesis is age-dependent. The current review covers the key features of <b>brain</b> <b>senescence</b> including morphological and functional changes related to the brain parenchyma, its vascular network and blood flow which could possibly influence the process of angiogenesis. This is followed by a description of post-stroke angiogenesis and its relationship to neuroregeneration and its modulation by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF 1), the most important factors active in old brain after ischemic injury.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Women's Health Initiative studies, both the clinical and basic science communities had to sort out divergent results among experimental findings, observational data and randomized controlled trials in order to establish a shared analysis. The scientific community formally debates the role of different HRT formulations, hormone doses, time of treatment initiation since the menopause and the age of treated women. Basic scientists demonstrated that the multiple neuroprotective effects of estrogen on brain cells may induce a differential biological response according to the time of treatment. Progesterone (but not all synthetic progestins) also has pivotal neuroactive functions in animal models of reproductive aging. Additionally, epidemiological surveys provide information regarding the detrimental role of hypogonadism on mental well-being.

40|$|Calorie {{restriction}} extends {{longevity and}} delays ageing in model organisms and mammals, opposing the onset and progression of {{an array of}} age-related diseases. These beneficial effects also extend {{to the maintenance of}} brain cognitive functions at later age and to the prevention, at least in rodents, of <b>brain</b> <b>senescence</b> and associated neurodegenerative disorders. In recent years, the molecular mechanisms underlying brain response to calorie restriction have begun to be elucidated, revealing the unanticipated role of a number of key nutrient sensors and nutrient-triggered signaling cascades in the translation of metabolic cues into cellular and molecular events that ultimately lead to increased cell resistance to stress, enhanced synaptic plasticity, and improved cognitive performance. Of note, the brain's role in CR also includes the activation of nutrient-sensitive hypothalamic circuitries and the implementation of neuroendocrine responses that impact the entire organism.

40|$|In this study, the <b>brain</b> of <b>senescence</b> {{accelerated}} mouse prone 8 (SAMP 8) mice {{model was}} adopted to investigate PTMs state (especially methylation patterns) of core histones (H 2 A, H 2 B, H 3 and H 4). Seven methylated sites (H 3 K 24, H 3 K 27, H 3 K 36, H 3 K 79, H 3 R 128, H 4 K 20 and H 2 A R 89) were detected by tandem matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) analysis. The methylation of H 3 K 27 and H 3 K 36 demonstrated a modulating relationship and methylated H 3 K 27 {{might contribute to}} the hypermethylation state and gene repression in aged brain. Western blotting results showed that mono-methylated H 4 K 20 decreased during SAMP 8 mice aging and di-methylated H 3 K 79 decreased in the brain of 12 -month-old SAMP 8 mice compared with age-matched senescence accelerated-resistant mouse (SAMR 1) control. Di-methylated H 3 K 79 could express in neuron cells of cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Whereas, the number of H 3 K 79 methylation negative cells was higher in the cortex of 12 -month old SAMP 8 mice than that of age-matched control SAMR 1 mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) result indicated homeodomain transcription factor Pbx 1 isoform 1 (Pbx 1), transcription factors and transcriptional regulator proteins, such as T-box isoform 20, TetR family precursor BAZ 2 B and ribosomal protein, were recruited to methylated H 3 K 79 site. Therefore, a model of methylated H 3 K 79 on gene transcriptional regulation was proposed. Furthermore, the consequences of decreased H 3 K 79 methylation in Neuro- 2 a (N 2 a) cells were investigated via transfection with Dot 1 (disruptor of telomeric silencing) siRNA. After transfection, N 2 a cells displayed shorter neurite and less dendrite. Proteomic change in the N 2 a cells provided convincing evidence for the multi-function of decreased H 3 K 79 methylation on transcriptional regulation, protein translation and folding, stress response and DNA breaks repair, which would contribute to brain dysfunction during neurodegenerative disease or aging. Nowadays, many countries including China are experiencing aging populations. Aging has become the major risk factor for many diseases, such as neurodegenerative disease. The studies {{on the role of}} epigenetics in the aging process have grown tremendously in recent years. However, no systematic investigations have provided the information on histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) in aged brain and the roles of histone PTMs in brain aging are still unknown. This study gave a new insight into the link between histone PTMs and brain aging. It could provide the experimental evidence for future studies and help us to better understand aging or neurodegenerative disease at epigenetic level. Furthermore, it could benefit for setting up the strategies for epigenetic therapy to neurodegenerative disease. Wang, Chunmei. Adviser: Ngai Saiming.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that age-associated impairment of cognitive and motor functions {{is due to}} oxidative molecular damage was tested in the mouse. In a blind study, senescent mice (aged 22 months) were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests for motor and cognitive functions and subsequently assayed for oxidative molecular damage as assessed by protein carbonyl concentration in {{different regions of the}} brain. The degree of age-related impairment in each mouse was determined by comparison to a reference group of young mice (aged 4 months) tested concurrently on the behavioral battery. The age-related loss of ability to perform a spatial swim maze task was found to be positively correlated with oxidative molecular damage in the cerebral cortex, whereas age-related loss of motor coordination was correlated with oxidative molecular damage within the cerebellum. These results support the view that oxidative stress is a causal factor in <b>brain</b> <b>senescence.</b> Furthermore, the findings suggest that age-related declines of cognitive and motor performance progress independently, and involve oxidative molecular damage within different regions of the brain...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{societies}} face {{new public}} health challenges {{associated with an}} increasingly aging population. Among these, pathological conditions linked to brain aging are paramount. Old age is {{a risk factor for}} important neurological impairments such as Alzheimer's disease or stroke. Even healthy elderly people usually present with milder forms of cognitive decline. This is possibly related to less-pronounced brain deficits seen in normal aging, including the shrinkage of neurons and the dense network of neurons and glia in the central nervous system known as the neuropil, a lower neurogenetic rate, impaired angiogenesis or brain accumulation of deleterious compounds. At least in mammals, age is also associated with a decline in insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels, a well-known neuroprotective agent. Recently, a relationship between serum IGF-I and >house-keeping> mechanisms in the brain has been evidenced in laboratory rodents. Serum IGF-I increases adult neurogenesis, sustains neuronal health through a variety of fundamental homeostatic mechanisms, participates in brain angiogenesis, contributes to brain β-amyloid clearance and affects learning and memory.

40|$|Calorie {{restriction}} delays <b>brain</b> <b>senescence</b> {{and prevents}} neurodegeneration, but critical regulators of these beneficial responses {{other than the}} NAD(+) -dependent histone deacetylase Sirtuin- 1 (Sirt- 1) are unknown. We report that effects of calorie restriction on neuronal plasticity, memory and social behavior are abolished in mice lacking cAMP responsive-element binding (CREB) - 1 in the forebrain. Moreover, CREB deficiency drastically reduces the expression of Sirt- 1 and the induction of genes relevant to neuronal metabolism and survival in the cortex and hippocampus of dietary-restricted animals. Biochemical studies reveal a complex interplay between CREB and Sirt- 1 : CREB directly regulates the transcription of the sirtuin in neuronal cells by binding to Sirt- 1 chromatin; Sirt- 1, in turn, is recruited by CREB to DNA and promotes CREB-dependent expression of target gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator- 1 α and neuronal NO Synthase. Accordingly, expression of these CREB targets is markedly reduced in the brain of Sirt KO mice that are, like CREB-deficient mice, poorly responsive to calorie restriction. Thus, the above circuitry, modulated by nutrient availability, links energy metabolism with neurotrophin signaling, participates in brain adaptation to nutrient restriction, and is potentially relevant to accelerated brain aging by overnutrition and diabetes...|$|E

In recent years, tremendous {{efforts have been}} made to design a suitable strategy for enhancing adult neurogenesis, which seems to be deterred due to <b>brain</b> <b>senescence</b> and several neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we evaluated the effects of ELF-EMF on neurogenesis and memory, following treatment with trimethyltin chloride (TMT) as a neurotoxicant. The mice in all groups (n= 56) were injected with BrdU during the experiment for seven consecutive days to label newborn cells. Spatial memory was assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM) test. By the end of the experiment, neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation were assessed in the hippocampus, using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Based on the findings, exposure to ELF-EMF enhanced spatial learning and memory in the MWM test. ELF-EMF exposure significantly enhanced the number of BrdU+ and NeuN+ cells in the dentate gyrus of adult mice (P< 0. 001 and P< 0. 05, resp.). Western blot analysis revealed significant upregulation of NeuroD 2 in ELF-EMF-exposed mice compared to the TMT-treated group (P< 0. 05). These findings suggest that ELF-EMF might have clinical implications for the improvement of neurodegenerative processes and could help develop a novel therapeutic approach in regenerative medicine...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the active}} {{research}} in this field, molecular mechanisms underlying exercise-induced beneficial effects on brain physiology and functions are still matter of debate, {{especially with regard to}} biological processes activated by regular exercise affecting the onset and progression of hippocampal aging in individuals unfamiliar with habitual physical activity. Since such responses seem to be mediated by changes in antioxidative, antiglycative and metabolic status, a possible exercise-induced coordinated response involving redox, methylglyoxal- and sirtuin-related molecular networks may be hypothesized. In this study, hippocampi of CD 1 mice undergoing the transition from mature to middle age were analyzed for redox-related profile, oxidative and methylglyoxal-dependent damage patterns, energy metabolism, sirtuin 1 and glyoxalase 1 expression after a 2 - or 4 -mo treadmill running program. Our findings suggested that the 4 -mo regular running lowered the chance of dicarbonyl and oxidative stress, activated mitochondrial catabolism and preserved sirtuin 1 -related neuroprotection. Surprisingly, the same cellular pathways were negatively affected by the first 2 months of exercise, thus showing an interesting biphasic response. In conclusion, the duration of exercise caused a profound shift in the response to regular running within the rodent hippocampus in a time-dependent fashion. This research revealed important details of the interaction between exercise and mammal hippocampus during the transition from mature to middle age, and this might help to develop non-pharmacological approaches aimed at retarding <b>brain</b> <b>senescence,</b> even in individuals unfamilia...|$|E
40|$|Brain inflammaging is {{increasingly}} considered {{as contributing to}} age-related cognitive loss and neurodegeneration. Despite intensive research in multiple models, no clinically effective pharmacological treatment has been found yet. Here, in the mouse model of <b>brain</b> <b>senescence</b> SAMP 8, we tested the effects of proinsulin, a promising neuroprotective agent that was previously proven {{to be effective in}} mouse models of retinal neurodegeneration. Proinsulin is the precursor of the hormone insulin but also upholds developmental physiological effects, particularly as a survival factor for neural cells. Adeno-associated viral vectors of serotype 1 bearing the human proinsulin gene were administered intramuscularly to obtain a sustained release of proinsulin into the blood stream, which was able to reach the target area of the hippocampus. SAMP 8 mice and the control strain SAMR 1 were treated at 1 month of age. At 6 months, behavioral testing exhibited cognitive loss in SAMP 8 mice treated with the null vector. Remarkably, the cognitive performance achieved in spatial and recognition tasks by SAMP 8 mice treated with proinsulin was similar to that of SAMR 1 mice. In the hippocampus, proinsulin induced the activation of neuroprotective pathways and the downstream signaling cascade, leading to the decrease of neuroinflammatory markers. Furthermore, the decrease of astrocyte reactivity was a central effect, as demonstrated in the connectome network of changes induced by proinsulin. Therefore, the neuroprotective effects of human proinsulin unveil a new pharmacological potential therapy in the fight against cognitive loss in the elderly. Postprint (published version...|$|E

However, astrocytes are involved in resolving different types of injuries and in aging processes in the <b>brain.</b> <b>Senescence</b> has also been reported in the brain, and senescence-associated loss of astrocyte function is linked to neuronal dysfunction in age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson's disease. For example, astrocyte senescence per se inhibits synapse maturation and affects synaptic transmission. In response to the cell’s bio-energetic state, mitochondria continuously undergo structural remodeling through fission and fusion processes. These tightly regulated events are believed to be involved in many cellular events such as apoptosis, senescence, and age-related diseases. Although, {{little is known about the}} age-related changes that occur in astrocytes and if these cells are able to generate a senescent phenotype mediated by mitochondria, in the present study we evaluated the involvement of mitochondrial remodeling in the senescence process of rat astrocytes in vitro. The results obtained showed that when comparing cells at population doubling two (PD 2) with cells at population doubling ten (PD 10) there is a significant increase in the activity of the senescence-associated β-galactosidase marker in PD 10 cells. In addition, PD 10 cells had increased mitochondrial volume, decreased superoxide production, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential.

40|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>senescence</b> and neurodegeneration {{occur with}} a {{mitochondrial}} dysfunction characterized by impaired electron transfer and by oxidative damage. Brain mitochondria of old animals show decreased rates of electron transfer in complexes I and IV, decreased membrane potential, increased {{content of the}} oxidation products of phospholipids and proteins and increased size and fragility. This impairment, with complex I inactivation and oxidative damage, is named “complex I syndrome” and is recognized as characteristic of mammalian brain aging and of neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunction is more marked in brain areas as rat hippocampus and frontal cortex, in human cortex in Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, and in substantia nigra in Parkinson’s disease. The molecular mechanisms involved in complex I inactivation include the synergistic inactivations produced by ONOO- mediated reactions, by reactions with free radical intermediates of lipid peroxidation and by amine-aldehyde adduction reactions. The accumulation of oxidation products prompts the idea of antioxidant therapies. High doses of vitamin E produce a significant protection of complex I activity and mitochondrial function in rats and mice, and with improvement of neurological functions and increased median life span in mice. Mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, as the Skulachev cations covalently attached to vitamin E, ubiquinone and PBN and the SS tetrapeptides, are negatively charged and accumulate in mitochondria where they exert their antioxidant effects. Activation of the cellular mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis is another potential therapeutic strategy, since the process generates organelles devoid of oxidation products and with full enzymatic activity and capacity for ATP production...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough the {{beneficial}} responses induced {{in the central}} nervous system by early-initiated exercise have been broadly investigated, the effects of a chronic and moderate lately-initiated exercise on biochemical hallmarks of very early <b>brain</b> <b>senescence</b> have not been extensively studied. We previously reported that a midlife-initiated regimen of moderate running was able not only to prevent the age-related decay of antioxidative and detoxification functions in mouse brain cortex, but also to preserve neurotrophic support and molecular integrity. On this basis, this work investigated whether and how a 2 -mo or 4 -mo midlife-initiated running protocol could affect the activity of those systems involved in maintaining neuronal function and in preventing the onset of neurodegeneration within the brain cortex of middle-aged CD- 1 mice. In particular, we analyzed the production of the peptide amyloid-β and the expression of synapsin Ia, which is known to {{play a key role in}} neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. In addition, we studied the expression of sirtuin 3, as a protein marker of neuroprotection against age-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as the pro-death pathway induced by proBDNF through the interaction with p 75 NTR and the co-receptor sortilin. The midlife-initiated 4 -mo running program triggered multiple responses within the mouse brain cortex, through the activation of anti-amyloidogenic, pro-survival, synaptogenic and neuroprotective pathways. However, most of {{the beneficial}} actions of the exercise regimen appeared only after 4 months, since 2 -mo-exercised mice showed marked impairments of the endpoints we considered. This could imply that a midlife-initiated regimen of moderate treadmill running may require an adequate time lag to activate beneficial compensative mechanisms within the mouse brain cortex...|$|E

Results: The in vitro BBB permeability (%, in 30  min) of EGCG, EGC and GA was 2. 8 ± 0. 1, 3. 4 ± 0. 3 and 6. 5 ± 0. 6, respectively. The permeability of EGCG into the BBB indicates that EGCG reached the brain parenchyma even at a very low concentration. The learning ability of SAMP 10 mice that ingested EGCG (20  mg/kg) was significantly higher than of mice that ingested EGC or GA. However, combined ingestion of EGC and GA showed a significant improvement comparable to EGCG. SH-SY 5 Y cell growth was significantly enhanced by 0. 05  µM EGCG, but this effect was reduced at higher concentrations. The effect of EGC and GA was lower than that of EGCG at 0. 05  µM. Co-administration of EGC and GA increased neurite length more than EGC or GA alone. Conclusion: Cognitive dysfunction in mice is suppressed after ingesting GTCs when a low concentration of EGCG is incorporated into the brain parenchyma via the BBB. Nerve cell proliferation/differentiation was enhanced by a low concentration of EGCG. Furthermore, the additive effect of EGC and GA suggests that EGCG sustains a preventive effect after the hydrolysis to EGC and GA...|$|E
