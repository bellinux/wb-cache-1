40|$|Leung, Little, and Li 1 In December 2000, a {{decision}} was made by Airbus Industries to undertake the development of the world largest aircraft, the A 380. Subsequently, the first A 380 flight was successfully conducted in April 2005 in France. Six airlines have indicated their intention to use the A 380 aircraft for operations at Hong Kong International Airport and plan to begin operations in late 2007 or early 2008. This paper describes the compatibility study carried out by the Hong Kong Airport Authority to identify the requirements to upgrade the airport facilities to ICAO Code 4 F standard. These include the widening of a number of taxiways, the relocation of infringing obstacles, relocation of runway stop bars, the modification of jet <b>blast</b> <b>fences,</b> and the modification of aircraft loading bridges, fixed ground power and preconditioned air systems. The paper also describes the various design options that were considered for the upgrade and the difficulties encountered implementing the changes under an operating airport environment. 1...|$|R

Airports in the 1960s used jet blast deflectors with a height of 6 to 8 ft, but airports in the 1990s needed deflectors that were twice as high, and even up to 35 ft high for jet airliners such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and MD-11, which have engines mounted in the tail above the fuselage.

The bridge was cut and pulled down via bulldozer, and cut into smaller pieces on the ground.|$|E
50|$|With the Yankees up 2-0, {{they sent}} David Cone {{to the mound}} to face former Yankee pitcher, Sterling Hitchcock, the MVP of the NLCS. Both teams were kept off the {{scoreboard}} until {{the bottom of the}} 6th when Hitchcock himself led off the inning with a single off Cone. He and Qulivio Veras both scored two batters later when Tony Gwynn shot a double down the line past Tino Martinez at first base. Gwynn would also score in the inning to give San Diego a 3-0 lead. However, a half inning later the Yanks jumped on Hitchcock for two runs beginning with a home run to left-center by Scott Brosius. The second run came in after Shane Spencer doubled and scored on an error by Ken Caminiti. In the 8th, the call was made to Trevor Hoffman after Randy Myers walked Paul O'Neill to open the inning.

40|$|A {{combined}} <b>blast</b> <b>fence</b> {{is introduced}} {{in this paper}} to improve the solid blast fences and louvered ones. Experiments of the jet engine exhaust flow (hereinafter jet flow for short) field and tests of three kinds of blast fences in two positions were carried out. The {{results show that the}} pressure and temperature at the centre of the jet flow decrease gradually as the flow moves farther away from the nozzle. The pressure falls fast with the maximum rate of 41. 7 %. The dynamic pressure 150 m away from the nozzle could reach 58. 8 Pa, with a corresponding wind velocity of 10 m/s. The temperature affected range of 40 °C is 113. 5 × 20 m. The combined <b>blast</b> <b>fence</b> not only reduces the pressure of the flow in front of it but also solves the problems that the turbulence is too strong behind the solid blast fences and the pressure is too high behind the louvered blast fences. And the pressure behind combined <b>blast</b> <b>fence</b> is less than 10 Pa. The height of the fence is related to the distance from the jet nozzle. The nearer the fence is to the nozzle, the higher it is. When it is farther from the nozzle, its height can be lowered...|$|E
