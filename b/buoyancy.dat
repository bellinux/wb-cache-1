5|$|The {{change in}} <b>buoyancy</b> of a diving {{cylinder}} during the dive {{can be more}} problematic with side-mounted cylinders, and the actual <b>buoyancy</b> at any point during the dive is a consideration with any cylinder that may {{be separated from the}} diver for any reason. Cylinders which will be stage-dropped or handed off to another diver should not change the diver's <b>buoyancy</b> beyond what can be compensated using their <b>buoyancy</b> compensator. Cylinders with approximately neutral <b>buoyancy</b> when full generally require the least compensation when detached.|$|E
5|$|It {{consists}} of a horizontal bar or bars suspended at the depth of intended decompression stops by buoys. The bars are of sufficient weight and the buoys of sufficient <b>buoyancy</b> that the trapeze will not easily change depth in turbulent water or if the divers experience <b>buoyancy</b> control problems.|$|E
5|$|The anti-torpedo bulges of the Admiral-class battlecruisers {{were the}} first fitted on a British capital ship to fully {{incorporate}} the lessons learned {{from a series of}} experiments begun before World War I. They consisted of an outer air space, an inner <b>buoyancy</b> space and the 1.5-inch protective bulkhead. The <b>buoyancy</b> space was filled with sealed steel crushing tubes intended to distribute the force of an explosion over as wide an area as possible as well as absorb as much of its force as possible. However, tests conducted after Hood was completed showed that filling the <b>buoyancy</b> space with water was equally as effective and considerably cheaper.|$|E
5|$|The loss of {{the weight}} of the gas taken from the {{cylinder}} makes the cylinder and diver more buoyant. This can be a problem if the diver is unable to remain neutrally buoyant {{towards the end of the}} dive because most of the gas has been breathed from the cylinder. The <b>buoyancy</b> change due to gas usage from back mounted cylinders is easily compensated by carrying sufficient diving weights to provide neutral <b>buoyancy</b> with empty cylinders at the end of a dive, and using the <b>buoyancy</b> compensator to neutralise the excess weight until the gas has been used.|$|E
5|$|To avoid injury during descent, divers must be {{competent}} at equalising the ears, sinuses and mask; {{they must}} also learn not to hold their breath while ascending, to avoid barotrauma of the lungs. The speed of ascent must be controlled to avoid DCS, which requires <b>buoyancy</b> control skills. Good <b>buoyancy</b> control and trim also allow the diver to manoeuvre and move about safely, comfortably and efficiently, using swimfins for propulsion.|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} trapeze is {{a device}} used in recreational diving and technical diving to make decompression stops {{more comfortable and}} more secure and provide the divers' surface cover with a visual reference for the divers' position. It consists of a horizontal bar or bars suspended at the depth of intended decompression stops by buoys. The bars are of sufficient weight and the buoys of sufficient <b>buoyancy</b> that the trapeze will not easily change depth in turbulent water or if the divers experience <b>buoyancy</b> control problems.|$|E
5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. As divers are seldom weighted to be very negatively buoyant, a positive <b>buoyancy</b> of 50kg is considered adequate by some authorities for general commercial use. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser <b>buoyancy</b> ay their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the <b>buoyancy</b> compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack.|$|E
5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the <b>buoyancy</b> of the float to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative <b>buoyancy,</b> so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bacteria}} can move {{using a variety}} of mechanisms: flagella are used for swimming through fluids; bacterial gliding and twitching motility move bacteria across surfaces; and changes of <b>buoyancy</b> allow vertical motion.|$|E
5|$|Since the Hindenburg {{disaster}} in 1937, helium has replaced hydrogen as a lifting gas in blimps and balloons {{due to its}} lightness and incombustibility, despite an 8.6% decrease in <b>buoyancy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{motion of}} the fluid is {{sustained}} by convection, motion driven by <b>buoyancy.</b> The temperature increases towards {{the center of the}} Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This <b>buoyancy</b> is enhanced by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left behind in the fluid, making it lighter. This is called compositional convection. A Coriolis effect, caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north-south polar axis.|$|E
5|$|Without the docking-pit, the {{caissons}} and extremities of {{the arms}} of the wheel would be immersed in water at the lower canal basin each time the wheel rotated. The <b>buoyancy</b> of the lower caisson would {{make it more difficult to}} turn the wheel.|$|E
5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser <b>buoyancy</b> at their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the <b>buoyancy</b> compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack. The diver ascends along the shotline, and may use it purely as a visual reference, or can hold on to it to positively control depth, or can climb up it hand over hand. A Jonline may be used to fasten a diver to a shotline during a decompression stop.|$|E
5|$|A solar balloon {{is a black}} balloon that {{is filled}} with {{ordinary}} air. As sunlight shines on the balloon, the air inside is heated and expands causing an upward <b>buoyancy</b> force, much like an artificially heated hot air balloon. Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high.|$|E
5|$|Buoyancy: The actual mass of {{the human}} brain is about 1400–1500 grams; however, the net weight of the brain {{suspended}} in the CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25-50 grams. The brain therefore exists in neutral <b>buoyancy,</b> which allows the brain to maintain its density without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill neurons in the lower sections without CSF.|$|E
5|$|Designed {{within the}} tight 35,000 ton {{limitations}} of the Washington Naval Treaty, wartime service necessitated increases over the design displacement, seriously reducing freeboard and affecting seaworthiness. This was most acute at the already low bow. With too little <b>buoyancy</b> forward the bows were easily buried even in moderate seas, with spray washing up over both forward turrets. Heavy seas could flood ‘A’ turret, drenching both men and machinery within.|$|E
5|$|Fisher's {{desire for}} a shallow draught was not merely based {{on the need to}} allow for inshore operations; ships tended to operate closer to deep load than {{anticipated}} and were often found lacking in freeboard, reserve <b>buoyancy</b> and safety against underwater attack. This experience led the DNC to reconsider the proportions of the hull to rectify the problems identified thus far. The Courageous-class ships were the first products of that re-evaluation.|$|E
5|$|In the argonaut (paper nautilus), {{the female}} secretes a fine, fluted, papery shell {{in which the}} eggs are {{deposited}} and in which she also resides while floating in mid-ocean. In this she broods the young, and it {{also serves as a}} <b>buoyancy</b> aid allowing her to adjust her depth. The male argonaut is minute by comparison and has no shell.|$|E
5|$|Incorrect {{unloading}} sequences and ballasting {{which resulted}} in the <b>buoyancy</b> of the hull becoming uneven and the hull therefore strained: Lack of crew training or knowing malpractice were possible explanations. Total was held largely to blame for this. However, given that all the personnel involved in the unloading had died in the explosion, it was difficult to be certain as to what had happened.|$|E
5|$|Japanese light tanks, {{which had}} good <b>buoyancy,</b> were towed across the straits to Lim Chu Kang Road where {{they joined the}} battle at dusk. With {{reinforced}} troops and tanks advancing down Choa Chua Kang Road, the Australian troops were {{no match for the}} tanks and fled to the hills of Bukit Panjang. The 5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army) captured Bukit Timah village by the evening of 11 February.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about how ctenophores get rid of waste {{products}} produced by the cells. The ciliary rosettes in the gastrodermis may help to remove wastes from the mesoglea, and may also help to adjust the animal's <b>buoyancy</b> by pumping water into {{or out of the}} mesoglea.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} have {{a relatively}} thin layer of blubber. Blubber can help with <b>buoyancy,</b> protection from predators (they {{would have a hard}} time getting through a thick layer of fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs.|$|E
5|$|Tactile sensory {{perception}} in divers may be impaired {{by the environmental}} protection suit and low temperatures. The combination of instability, equipment, neutral <b>buoyancy</b> and resistance to movement by the inertial and viscous effects of the water encumbers the diver. Cold causes losses in sensory and motor function and distracts from and disrupts cognitive activity. The ability to exert large and precise force is reduced.|$|E
5|$|The Andean Volcanic Belt {{consists}} of three main volcanic zones: the Northern Volcanic Zone (from 2° N to 5° S), the Central Volcanic Zone (16° to 28° S) and the Southern Volcanic Zone (33° to 46° S). Active volcanism occurs where the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate. The plates are separated by shallower subduction zones, with no present-day volcanism. These shallower zones {{have been attributed to}} the high speed of the plate collision, the young age of the subducting oceanic lithosphere and the curvature of the subducting plate. The most plausible theory is that variations in <b>buoyancy</b> of a subducting plate creates a flat subduction zone. The Cocos, Juan Fernandez and Nazca Ridges are associated with such volcanic gaps where they collide with the oceanic trench. The subduction of spreading ridges can also diminish volcanism, as observed in the Chile Rise further south. The <b>buoyancy</b> of these crustal structures may hinder subduction, reducing water supply to the mantle and inducing the formation of melts.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific blue-eye {{is found}} in loose schools of tens to {{thousands}} of fish. They are generally found in the mid- to upper water column within 1 metre (3 ft) of the riverbank and often close to underwater cover. The Pacific blue-eye is euryhaline—it can survive {{in a wide range}} of water salinities from fresh-water to marine environments. It responds to changes in salinity (and resulting change in <b>buoyancy)</b> by changing the volume of its swim bladder, which takes up to 6 hours and 40 minutes when salinity is reduced and around 5 hours when it is increased. In the meantime, the fish can swim with a head-up or head-down posture, which either increases or decreases <b>buoyancy</b> respectively. This adaptation helps the fish in the range of salinities it encounters in its estuarine environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{thickness}} of the cylinder walls {{is directly related to}} the working pressure, and this affects the <b>buoyancy</b> characteristics of the cylinder. A low-pressure cylinder will be more buoyant than a high-pressure cylinder with similar size and proportions of length to diameter and in the same alloy.|$|E
5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of <b>buoyancy.</b> An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes of missing decompression stops. Diving suit failure in cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver is willing to carry out.|$|E
5|$|All whales have a {{thick layer}} of blubber. In species that live near the poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. This blubber can help with <b>buoyancy</b> (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), {{protection}} to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through {{a thick layer}} of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E
5|$|Andrée gave a glowingly optimistic {{account of}} {{the ease with which}} these {{requirements}} could be met. Larger balloons had been constructed in France, he claimed, and more airtight, too. Some French balloons had remained hydrogen-filled for over a year without appreciable loss of <b>buoyancy.</b> As for the hydrogen, filling the balloon at the launch site could easily be done with the help of mobile hydrogen manufacturing units; for the steering he referred to his own drag-rope experiments with the Svea, stating that a deviation of 27degrees from the wind direction could be routinely achieved.|$|E
5|$|Because Missouri had {{run aground}} during {{an unusually high}} tide, Wallin {{required}} a date on which the tide would be roughly comparable to {{the conditions under which}} Missouri was grounded in order to free her. The date selected was 2 February. With time as a factor, Wallin took charge of the operation and put his five-point plan into motion. With the assistance of Admiral Smith, Wallin was able to assemble a large salvage force which included submarine rescue ships, special salvage ships, divers, and pontoons to add additional <b>buoyancy</b> for the tug boats when the time came to move Missouri.|$|E
5|$|Each {{submarine}} {{is equipped}} with three Garden Island-Hedemora HV V18b/15Ub (VB210) 18-cylinder diesel engines, which are each connected to a 1,400kW, 440-volt DC Jeumont-Schneider generator. The combined electrical generation capability of each submarine is 4.2 megawatts. The Hedemora diesels were chosen because of modular construction, which made servicing easier; they could be installed three across in the available space, while other contenders required at least two banks of two; and they had turbochargers driven by the exhaust gas. Fifteen fuel tanks are located throughout the submarine: they must be used in specific sequences to preserve the submarine's <b>buoyancy</b> and trim.|$|E
5|$|In {{cold water}} diving, where a diver wearing a highly buoyant {{thermally}} insulating dive suit {{has a large}} excess of <b>buoyancy,</b> steel cylinders are often used because they are denser than aluminium cylinders. They also often have a lower mass than aluminium cylinders with the same gas capacity, due to considerably higher material strength, so the use of steel cylinders can result in both a lighter cylinder and less ballast required for the same gas capacity, a two way saving on overall dry weight carried by the diver.|$|E
5|$|Initially, sauropods {{were thought}} to be mainly aquatic, inhabiting lush peat swamps and being captive to the <b>buoyancy</b> of water to support their giant body weights. In 1984, Cooper pointed out that Vulcanodon, the most {{primitive}} sauropod known at that time, lived in a desert like environment and therefore must have been terrestrial. This indicated that the large body size of sauropods, as already seen in Vulcanodon, had not evolved as an adaptation to an aquatic life style.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how ctenophores control their <b>buoyancy,</b> but experiments {{have shown that}} some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities. Their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater. If they enter less dense brackish water, the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density, to avoid sinking. Conversely if they move from brackish to full-strength seawater, the rosettes may pump {{water out of the}} mesoglea to reduce its volume and increase its density.|$|E
5|$|Its {{high density}} and {{resistance}} to corrosion have been exploited {{in a number of}} related applications. It is used as ballast in sailboat keels. Its weight allows it to counterbalance the heeling effect of wind on the sails; being so dense it takes up a small volume and minimizes water resistance. It is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver's <b>buoyancy.</b> In 1993, the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was stabilized with 600 tonnes of lead. Because of its corrosion resistance, lead is used as a protective sheath for underwater cables.|$|E
5|$|Living almost {{exclusively}} in the aphotic zone where little to no sunlight penetrates, the Portuguese dogfish is relatively common and the dominant shark species in deeper waters. The large, squalene-rich liver of this shark allows it to maintain neutral <b>buoyancy</b> and hover with minimal effort; males contain more squalene in their livers than females. A tracking study in the Porcupine Seabight {{has found that the}} Portuguese dogfish has an average swimming speed of , and does not remain in any particular area for long. This species may be preyed upon by larger fishes and sharks. Known parasites of this species include monogeneans in the genus Erpocotyle, and the tapeworms Sphyriocephalus viridis, S. richardi, and Anthobothrium sp.|$|E
