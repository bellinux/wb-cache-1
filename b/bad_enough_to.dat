For the two months she was there, Chaplin and his brother Sydney were sent {{to live with their}} father, whom the young boys scarcely knew. Charles Sr. was by then a severe alcoholic, and life there was <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> provoke a visit from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Chaplin's father died two years later, at 38 years old, from cirrhosis of the liver.|$|E

Hamlin's car then slid right back {{up in front of}} the No. 88 and slammed into the left-side door of the car, and the contact was <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> send Earnhardt behind the wall, and suffer a 39th-place finish. This was his second DNF of the year, after the early exit in the spring Texas race.|$|E

25|$|W+K {{contracted}} {{production company}} Gorgeous Enterprises to handle {{production of the}} four television spots. Direction would be split between Frank Budgen (Tag, Racing, and Shaderunner) and Tom Carty (Tailgating). Budgen, known for his previous work on spots such as Bet on Black for Guinness and Hero's Return for Stella Artois, immediately began assembling a crew and scouting potential locations for the shoot. When the team arrived at the final location, several blocked-off streets of the Canadian city of Toronto, the weather was <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> force the team to rewrite the script in order to finish on schedule.|$|E
500|$|Mozart's {{creative}} {{progress is}} likewise {{reflected in the}} sonatas composed for the Princess of Orange, which, according to Sadie, mark a considerable advance in technique and ideas over the earlier Paris and London sets. The arias composed in the Netherlands include Mozart's first attempts at [...] "aria d'affetto", Per pièta, bell'idol mio, K. 73b, once {{thought to have been}} composed much later, as its higher K number indicates. The tour thus saw Wolfgang's transformation from a composer of simple keyboard pieces to one with increasing mastery over a range of genres. This was evidenced in his home city, on 8 December, when one of his symphonies (it is uncertain which) was performed at High Mass at Salzburg Cathedral. Leopold's employer, the Prince-Archbishop, was frankly sceptical about Wolfgang's compositions, believing them to be Leopold's because they were [...] "not nearly <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be the work of a child".|$|E
500|$|The {{existence}} of the band itself caused a debate in the metal underground. For example, during the early 1990s, Bård Faust of Emperor brought up the subject when he discussed with Euronymous, guitarist/vocalist from the seminal black metal band Mayhem, in his zine Orcustus about the Norwegian scene. Faust asked: [...] "Don't you think that something is terribly wrong when it {{has gone so far}} that we have a Christian [...] "death metal" [...] band here (Crush Evil)? Any advice on how we should kill them?" [...] Euronymous replied to this: [...] "It's <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have a couple of society bands, but a Christian band is too much. But don't worry, we have plans. They will not continue for a very long time." [...] However, the band persevered despite these threats. Antestor was never forced to split apart, and in an almost ironic twist of fate, Jan Axel Blomberg (better known as Hellhammer, the drummer for Mayhem) was Antestor's session drummer on their latest two releases.|$|E

500|$|The audio of Escape from Butcher Bay was {{generally}} well received, and critics praised its voice acting; {{the performances of}} Vin Diesel and Cole Hauser were given special commendation. In regard to the music, FiringSquad's Jakub Wojnarowicz stated, [...] "It's {{not good enough to}} sweep you away but it's also not <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> stick out like a sore thumb". IGN said, [...] "The music isn't memorable, but it's not bad". The Sunday Herald Sun called the voice acting [...] "Surprisingly good". The game's length was commonly criticized. Reviewers noted that it could be completed in eight to fifteen hours, and IGN said, [...] "If you consider around 12 hours of gameplay short, then Riddick is just that." [...] Several reviewers were displeased by the game's lack of multiplayer components; Computer and Video Games referred to it as a [...] "missed opportunity". Game Informer said, [...] "Since the main quest is short [...] and there is no multiplayer, it’s not a ton of game for your money." ...|$|E
500|$|The play {{received}} overwhelmingly negative reviews, {{although some}} critics had minor compliments for Bara. Biographer Eve Golden described the reviews of Bara's acting as [...] "nothing less than vicious", but the commentary about the {{play as a}} whole was even more negative. Variety expected Bara to draw audiences to the theater for at least a few weeks, but said opinions in the daily press were united about how bad the play was. In The New York Times, Alexander Woollcott mocked the dialogue, which included lines such as, [...] "Have you brought the cocaine?" [...] and [...] "You make my heart laugh and I feel like a woman of the streets." [...] Delivered seriously, this dialog drew laughter from the audience. Woollcott highlighted one particular line: [...] "I'm going to be so bad, I'll be remembered always." [...] He said Bara was bad, but not <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be memorable. He credited her for speaking clearly and for not losing her composure when the audience laughed at her. Other reviewers gave Bara similarly faint praise: she had [...] "average competence" [...] or [...] "was not so bad". Some complimented her looks or her glamorous wardrobe.|$|E
500|$|MTV writer Josh Wigler {{thought the}} episode [...] "nearly put [...] to sleep," [...] {{as it was}} [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "a bit of a dud". The episode however did lead Wigler to [...] "start dig" [...] Sam Weiss, and also to enjoying Olivia's subplot, but {{believed}} the episode's monster-of-the-week {{could have been used}} to actually parallel her trauma; Wigler appreciated how the Fringe case tied into Walter and Peter's backstories. He concluded, [...] "It wasn't <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make me concerned for the future of Fringe or anything, but it certainly didn't keep me {{on the edge of my}} seat waiting for the next crazy twist like last week. I'm still loving this season, but tonight's episode was one of the weaker outings." [...] Newsarama's Chanel Reeder stated [...] "Dream Logic" [...] "certainly put the brakes on the speed that Fringe had gained in the previous" [...] episode, but praised the connection with Peter's past as [...] "one of the most interesting underlying parts". Reeder's favorite part was Sam Weiss, calling him [...] "a fantastic dimension to the show". Josie Kafka of Open Salon was more positive than other reviewers, and in particular highlighted the episode's humor, [...] "Almost all of the Cambridge scenes were funny: Astrid and Walter have a great rapport, especially when there's a rube in the room for them to play with." [...] She concluded [...] "I liked this one, more for the great Peter/Olivia and Walter/Astrid stuff than the plot of the week," [...] and gave the episode [...] "Three out of four anagrams".|$|E

500|$|Striptease was {{generally}} panned by film critics. It holds a 12% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 68 reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times complimented {{some of the}} characters, but ultimately concluded the film failed because [...] "all of the characters are hilarious except for Demi Moore's." [...] He felt the drama surrounding the main character [...] "throws a wetblanket {{over the rest of}} the party." [...] Ebert also found the nudity not too sexy. Leonard Maltin was harsher, writing in his book that the film was too depressing, and [...] "Not funny enough, or dramatic enough, or sexy enough, or <b>bad</b> <b>enough,</b> <b>to</b> qualify as entertainment in any category." [...] Barbara Cramer concurred with Ebert that Moore's character was written too dramatically, compared to other characters. She said the film was predictable and would appeal mostly to [...] "post-pubescent schoolboys or closet voyeurs." [...] However, Cramer also cited Reynolds' [...] "his best role in years," [...] and that Rhames was [...] "worth the price of admission." [...] Brian D. Johnson of Maclean's, who thought Moore's acting was terrible, predicted that despite Moore's financial success, her career depended on the success of this film and the film was [...] "tacky, pretentious-and boring." [...] This critic described Striptease as displaying Moore's vanity. Dave Ansen of Newsweek, sharing Ebert's view on Moore's character, also claimed Striptease failed as a drama because it had no mystery, revealing the identity of its villains early. Moreover, the [...] "damsel-in-distress angle generates zero tension." [...] Daniel P. Franklin, ...|$|E
500|$|John Ulmer of website One Thirty BPM {{gave the}} song seven points {{out of a}} {{possible}} ten, and published a mixed review; he praised it for being a more serious track compared to previous lead singles [...] "Just Lose It" [...] (2004) and [...] "We Made You" [...] (2009) but criticized it for being less powerful compared to his 2002 hit single, [...] "Lose Yourself", and [...] "Beautiful". According to Ulmer, [...] "Upon first listen it's a bit corny, but it's appropriately anthemic, and not <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> deter from the strength of the overall track." [...] He noted that although Eminem does not have as much of a frustrated voice as he does in [...] "Despicable", he admits that Relapse was a silly album. Pitchfork Media's Jayson Greene wrote a rather negative review on Recovery and was very dismissive on the song: [...] "Eminem spends nearly half of Recovery insisting he's the best rapper alive, {{but for the first time}} in his career, he actually sounds clumsy." [...] Kitty Empire of newspaper The Guardian also wrote negatively on the song in her album review, criticizing the song's lyrics: [...] "Rhyming 'through a storm' with 'whatever weather/ cold or warm' in the chorus is unforgivable for a master rhymer." [...] As part of his album review, Greg Kot of daily newspaper Chicago Tribune criticized Eminem's lyrics and rhymes in [...] "Not Afraid", comparing them to his rhyming skills back when his 2002 hip hop drama film, 8 Mile, premiered: [...] "Doesn't he realize that's the kind of cheese that the battle-rhyming Eminem of 8 Mile would've mercilessly mocked?" ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{have given}} {{suggestions}} as Jason's motivation for killing. Ken Kirzinger refers to Jason as a [...] "psychotic mama's boy gone horribly awry...very resilient. You can't kill him, but he feels pain, just not like everyone else." [...] Kirzinger {{goes on to}} say that Jason is a [...] "psycho-savant", and believes his actions are based on pleasing his mother, and not anything personal. Andrew O'Hehir has stated, [...] "Coursing hormones act, of course, as smelling salts to prudish Jason, that ever-vigilant enforcer of William Bennett-style values." [...] Todd Farmer, writer for Jason X, wrote the scene where Jason wakes from cryonic hibernation just as two of the teenagers are having sex. Farmer liked the idea that sex acts triggered Jason back to life. Whatever his motivations, Kane Hodder believes there is a limit to what he will do. According to Hodder, Jason might violently murder any person he comes across, but when Jason Takes Manhattan called for Hodder to kick the lead character's dog, Hodder refused, stating that, while Jason has no qualms against killing humans, he is not <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> hurt animals. Another example from Jason Takes Manhattan, involves Jason being confronted by a street gang of young teenage boys one of whom threatens him with a knife, however Jason chooses not to kill them and instead scares them off by lifting up his mask and showing them his face. Likewise, director Tom McLoughlin chose not to have Jason harm any of the children he encounters in Jason Lives, stating that Jason would not kill a child, out of a sympathy for the plight of children generated by his own death as a child.|$|E

2500|$|By the war's end, {{the impact}} of air {{missions}} on the ground war was in retrospect mainly tactical – strategic bombing, in particular, was still very rudimentary indeed. This was partly due to its restricted funding and use, as it was, after all, a new technology. On the other hand, the artillery, which had perhaps the greatest effect of any military arm in this war, was in very large part as devastating as {{it was due to}} the availability of aerial photography and aerial [...] "spotting" [...] by balloon and aircraft.

2500|$|Grandmaster (GM) John Nunn adds a caveat: when {{in a bad}} position, {{one must}} decide between two strategies, which he calls [...] "grim [...] " [...] and [...] "create confusion." [...] "Grim defence" [...] {{involves}} finding some way to hang on, often by liquidating to an ending. [...] "Create confusion" [...] entails trying to [...] "gain the initiative, even at material cost, hoping to stir up complications and cause the opponent to go wrong." [...] Nunn cautions that, [...] "If you decide to go for 'create confusion' then you should press the panic button sufficiently early to give yourself a reasonable chance of success.

2500|$|Marty Duffy of Sligo was {{appointed}} match referee for the final. The decision led to comment from former managers of both counties {{involved in the}} final, Mick O'Dwyer who expressed his belief that the choice of referee was based on [...] "politics" [...] and Billy Morgan who thought that Pat McEnaney {{ought to have been}} appointed referee instead. The GAA officially refused to offer a response to the two men. Liam and Sam in the Irish Independent compared the [...] "pre-emptive" [...] criticism of the referee to a scenario where the referee were to question the manner in which one of the teams play the sport or express dismay that a better team should have qualified for the final instead. Radio Kerry analyst and former referee Weeshie Fogarty expressed his dismay at the criticism of Duffy, commenting: [...] "It's <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> referee big games in Croke Park and see your name being castigated in the papers and torn asunder the following week. But by God, when it happens before the game, that is a new trend to me".|$|E
2500|$|The {{first ever}} Australian Grand Prix to be {{included}} {{as part of the}} Formula One World Championship was also the 50th AGP. The new 3.78km Adelaide Street Circuit saw Brazilian Ayrton Senna on pole with a time of 1:19.843 in his Lotus–Renault. The race itself was a battle between Senna and Finland's Keke Rosberg driving a Williams–Honda for the last time. Run in oppressively hot conditions, the last race of the 1985 season ran to its 2-hour time limit, though all scheduled 82 laps were run. Rosberg ultimately prevailed finishing 43 seconds in front of the Ligier–Renaults of Frenchmen Jacques Laffite and Philippe Streiff who actually collided at the hairpin at the end of Brabham Straight with only one lap to go when Streiff tried a passing move that resulted in his car suffering broken suspension, though not <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cause retirement. Three time World Champion Austrian Niki Lauda drove his last Formula One race at this event. After starting 16th in his McLaren, {{he made his way to}} the lead by lap 57, but a lack of brakes cause him to crash into a wall in a sad end to his Formula One career. Australia had its own driver in the race with [...] World Champion Alan Jones driving a Lola–Hart. Jones, who started 19th, stalled at the start but fought his way to sixth by lap 20 before retiring later in the lap with electrical failure. The 1986 event was a three-way race for the Drivers' Championship. Briton Nigel Mansell and Brazilian Nelson Piquet in Williams–Hondas and Frenchman Alain Prost, in a comparatively underpowered McLaren–TAG/Porsche, were competing for the drivers' title. Mansell needed only third to guarantee the title, whilst Prost and Piquet needed to win and for Mansell to finish fourth or lower to take the title. Finn Keke Rosberg led for 62 laps before a puncture that caused damage to his McLaren; this was the 1982 champion's last Formula One race. Whilst comfortably in the top three with 20 laps to go, Mansell's Williams suffered a spectacular mechanical failure, with a rear tyre puncture at [...] on the Brabham Straight, creating a huge shower of sparks as the floor of the vehicle dragged along the bitumen surface. Mansell fought to control the violently veering car and steered it to a safe stop. Prost took the lead, as Mansell's teammate Piquet had pitted as a pre-cautionary measure, and the Frenchman won the race and the championship. Prost had to fight back after a mid-race puncture, and stopped soon after the finish so as not to waste fuel, something he had done at every race he finished since his disqualification from the 1985 San Marino Grand Prix for being underweight after his McLaren ran out of fuel on his slow down lap after crossing the line first. 1987 saw Gerhard Berger win in his Ferrari while Ayrton Senna finished second but was then disqualified for technical irregularities in his last race for Lotus; Berger's teammate Michele Alboreto was then moved up to second place to make the final result a Ferrari 1–2.|$|E
