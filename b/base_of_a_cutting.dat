40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} concerned with the formation of adventitious roots in stem cuttings of Pinus species, with particular attention to P. radiata, shows that many influences interact to con-trol root initiation processes, the number of root primordia that form and the rate at which they develop. In P. radiata, roots are initiated in callus tissue produced at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting.</b> Material taken from mature trees can be more difficult to root than that from younger plants, particularly if the parent trees are not healthy and vigorous, but here pre-severance treatments, in-cluding hormone applications, can assist. Light and temperature climates are important but their effects have not yet been fully investigated. Physiological ageing is another factor not well under-stood and is important in that it appears that some measure of rejuvenation can be achieved. It is concluded that further advances in understanding rooting processes will come mainly from the use of modern methods of laboratory investigation, particularly from studies carried out in controlled environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} indole-butyric acid, both alone {{and with a}} low {{concentration}} of kinetin, on the rooting of rose cuttings in winter and summer, is presented in this paper. The experiments were conducted using 500 and 1000 mg/l IBA {{with or without the}} addition of 5 mg/l kinetin. The growth regulators were applied by dipping the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> for 5 s in an aqueous solution of these substances. Cuttings 5 - 6 cm in length were made from the mid-part of a stem of a rose grown in a greenhouse. The experiments were carried out using 'Queen of Bermuda' and 'Baccara' cuttings. The investigations showed that treating rose cuttings rooted in winter with an IBA solution had a significant promotive effect on the quantity of rooted cuttings, number of formed roots on the cutting, {{as well as on the}} length of the longest root. A distinctive increase in the number of breaking buds was also seen on the cuttings treated with IBA. The IBA solution applied to cuttings rooted in the summer significantly decreased the number of rooted cuttings and breaking buds. However, no significant influence on the number and length of formed roots was found. Addition of kinetin to the IBA solutions did not have any effect on the rooting of rose cuttings either in winter or summer...|$|E
