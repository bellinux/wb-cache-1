5|$|A Coast Guard {{detachment}} {{aboard the}} Fife confirmed {{that it was}} properly flying the U.S. flag. The Coast Guard was suspicious since the ship was low in the water, suggesting it was carrying heavy cargo, yet there were no cranes or other equipment that a legitimate fishing vessel would <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> have. Instead there were several large shipping containers. Via radio, they asked the Joint Interagency Task Force West, a consortium of various federal law enforcement agencies, for permission to investigate further, since smugglers and drug traffickers were known to use that route.|$|E
5|$|According to Walter Breen, Snowden {{most likely}} chose the {{combination}} of the Indian Head and the laurel wreath as it was the lowest relief of any of the options, and could <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> strike well. On November 4, 1858, Snowden wrote to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb about the Indian Head design, and two days later wrote to Longacre, informing him that it was approved. Longacre was to prepare the necessary dies for production, which was to begin on January 1, 1859.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, {{has pointed out that}} bumblebees would not <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} DNA, from {{a limited}} number of specimens, suggested that there was gene flow within the continental Asian populations until the 20th century reductions in range, and that Australia was colonized only in the Late Pleistocene, some 35,000 years ago. This has been corroborated by nDNA microsatellite analyses with four times the sample size. This study further suggests that the Australian population is quite inbred. As there exists the possibility of (limited) hybridization with the genetically distinct brolga, the Australian sarus crane can <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be an incipient species.|$|E

The pairs of Army Reserve brigades will <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to provide}} a battalion-sized force upon {{mobilisation}} during the regular brigade's 12 month 'ready' phase.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Rhine Campaign of 1795 the {{two sides}} had called a truce. Despite the truce, both sides planned for war. In a decree on 6 January 1796, Lazare Carnot gave Germany {{priority}} over Italy as a theater of war. The First French Republic's finances were in poor shape so its armies would <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> invade new territories and then live off the conquered lands. Knowing that the French planned to invade Germany, on 20 May 1796 the Austrians announced that the truce would end on 31 May, and prepared for invasion.|$|E

5|$|Benford's law {{describes}} {{the occurrence of}} digits in many data sets, such as heights of buildings.

5|$|During secret {{surrender}} {{negotiations with}} the Allies in early September, the Italian government offered to open the ports of Taranto and Brindisi on the eastern coast.

5|$|Electricity is used within telecommunications, {{and indeed}} the {{electrical}} telegraph, demonstrated commercially in 1837 by Cooke and Wheatstone, was one of its earliest applications.

5|$|Fifty-eight {{cardinals}} {{were present}} on 9 October when the conclave began.

5|$|Four {{anatomic}} features must {{be present}} for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening (full {{range of motion}} of the temporomandibular joint), sufficient pharyngeal space (determined by examining {{the back of the}} mouth), sufficient submandibular space (distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin, the space into which the tongue must be displaced in order for the larygoscopist to view the glottis), and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint.
