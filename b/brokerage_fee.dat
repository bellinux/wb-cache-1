25|$|Because ETFs {{trade on}} an exchange, each {{transaction}} is generally {{subject to a}} brokerage commission. Commissions depend on the brokerage and which plan is chosen by the customer. For example, a typical flat fee schedule from an online brokerage firm in the United States ranges from $10 to $20, {{but it can be}} as low as $0 with discount brokers. Due to this commission cost, the amount invested has a great bearing; someone who wishes to invest $100 per month may have a significant percentage of their investment destroyed immediately, while for someone making a $200,000 investment, the commission cost may be negligible. Generally, mutual funds obtained directly from the fund company itself do not charge a <b>brokerage</b> <b>fee.</b> Thus, when low or no-cost transactions are available, ETFs become very competitive.|$|E
25|$|A {{currency}} transaction tax {{is a tax}} {{placed on}} {{a specific type of}} currency transaction for a specific purpose. This term has been most commonly associated with the financial sector, as opposed to consumption taxes paid by consumers. The most frequently discussed versions of a currency transaction tax are the Tobin tax, Edgar L. Feige's Automated Payment Transaction tax and Spahn tax. The Automated Payment Transaction tax requires that all transactions be taxed regardless of the means of payment. As such, it proposes a unique tax on currency transactions collected at the time currency leaves or enters the banking system. Since each transaction mediated by currency can not be directly taxed, the APT tax proposes a <b>brokerage</b> <b>fee</b> on currency deposits and withdrawals that is some multiple of the flat transaction tax rate applied to all payments made via electronic payments mechanisms.|$|E
500|$|Although trading {{companies}} such as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch used the conventional [...] "agent model" [...] for reporting revenue (where only the trading or <b>brokerage</b> <b>fee</b> would be reported as revenue), Enron instead selected to report the entire value of each of its trades as revenue. This [...] "merchant model" [...] was considered much more aggressive in the accounting interpretation than the agent model. Enron's method of reporting inflated trading revenue was later adopted by other companies in the energy trading industry {{in an attempt to}} stay competitive with the company's large increase in revenue. Other energy {{companies such as}} Duke Energy, Reliant Energy, and Dynegy joined Enron in the wealthiest 50 of the Fortune 500 mainly due to their adoption of the same trading revenue accounting as Enron.|$|E
40|$|The current {{tax laws}} favor <b>brokerage</b> <b>fees</b> as {{compared}} to investment advisory fees, even though investment advisors are held {{to a higher standard}} of fiduciary duty. My article examines the different tax treatment of investment advisory <b>fees</b> and <b>brokerage</b> <b>fees,</b> analyzes the policy considerations of such treatment and proposes alternatives to the current system. Considering the large number of American investing in the securities markets, it is important that our tax laws be written in a way that encourages taxpayers to seek investment professionals who are held to higher standards of conduct. The policy implications of <b>brokerage</b> <b>fees</b> receiving preferable tax treatment are considerable, yet have been ignored by Congress. This article will hopefully open a debate on the tax treatment of fees that investment professionals charge...|$|R

5000|$|A {{dilution}} levy can {{be charged}} {{at the discretion}} of the fund manager, to offset the cost of market transactions resulting from large un-matched buy or sell orders.

The same is the case with large sell orders.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new evidence}} {{on the impact of}} electronic trading on brokerage commissions by investigating a sample period that covers the period of transition from floor to electronic trading on the Sydney Futures Exchange. After controlling for liquidity, volatility and broker identity, the introduction of electronic trading remains to be associated with lower brokerage commissions relative to floor markets. The study also provides new evidence on brokerage commissions in futures markets finding that commission fees charged on futures trades average 0. 002 % of transaction value. This is up to 120 times smaller than the magnitude of <b>brokerage</b> <b>fees</b> charged in stock markets, and considerably lower than the magnitude of <b>brokerage</b> <b>fees</b> assumed for futures markets in previous research. Consistent with existing studies based on stock markets, commissions charged per contract decrease with order size reflecting economies of scale in the provision of brokerage services in futures markets. Commission rates are positively related to bid-ask spreads and price volatility, which proxy for the probability of execution error costs and execution difficulty, respectively. Finally, the identity of the broker is found to be a significant determinant of commissions reflecting different pricing schedules across brokers. 15 page(s...|$|R
