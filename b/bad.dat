5|$|A partial ouster or {{time limit}} clause {{specifies}} a restricted period, after which no remedy will be available. Such clauses are generally effective, unless the public authority has acted in <b>bad</b> faith. Similarly, {{the existence of}} <b>bad</b> faith entitles applicants to challenge decisions of authorities despite the existence of statutory provisions declaring such decisions to be conclusive evidence of certain facts. In the absence of <b>bad</b> faith, the courts will enforce conclusive evidence clauses.|$|E

50|$|Gerhard Adolph <b>Bading</b> (August 31, 1870 - April 11, 1946) was an American physician, politician, and diplomat. <b>Bading</b> is {{best remembered}} as the 31st mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, serving from 1912 to 1916. <b>Bading</b> also served as U.S. Envoy and an Ambassador Extraordinary to Ecuador from 1922 until his {{retirement}} in 1930.|$|R
40|$|Whereas {{exchange}} asymmetries {{for goods}} are well known, we provide a first incentivized test of exchange asymmetries for <b>bads</b> (i. e., items yielding a negative utility). On the one hand, prospect theory predicts an endowment effect for goods and <b>bads,</b> {{on the other}} hand, attention-based theories such as salience theory predict an endowment effect for goods, but a reverse endowment effect (i. e., a particular high willingness to switch) for <b>bads.</b> Since both strands of research often make the same predictions concerning biased decision making, the investigation of exchange asymmetries for <b>bads</b> {{is a key element}} to distinguish between their validity. In our experiment, we find a strong endowment effect for <b>bads,</b> so that our results speak in favor of prospect theory...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Badding</b> Rug is a Victorian {{cross-stitch}} needlepoint made in 1950 {{entirely by}} hand by Carolyn <b>Badding</b> of San Leandro, California. Measuring 12 feet by 15 feet, on a Smyrna canvas backing of seven strips assembled {{to be one}} piece before any stitching began, it features approximately 1,260,000 stitches in French wool. Research done prior to its completion revealed no record of any needlepoint rug of the proportions of the <b>Badding</b> Rug completed by any American citizen. This rug was credited in numerous news articles to be a masterpiece in needlepoint. The <b>Badding</b> Rug was compared to one owned by Queen Mary that was fashioned of six completed strips sewn together.|$|R
5|$|Good Girl Gone <b>Bad</b> Live is {{the first}} live long-form video by Barbadian singer Rihanna. It was first {{released}} on June 9, 2008 by Def Jam Recordings.

It also contains a special Documentary Feature that presents Rihanna discussing her experiences during the tour.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by David S. Cohen, Dan Greaney and Steve Tompkins, with Ken Keeler {{coming up with the}} story and the general idea of {{intentionally}} <b>bad</b> writing. It was directed by Neil Affleck, and Tim Conway, Gailard Sartain and Phil Hartman guest-starred. The producers were initially uneasy about the episode, as they feared that the purposely <b>bad</b> writing would be mistaken for actual <b>bad</b> writing. The episode, however, now appears on several lists of the most popular Simpsons episodes.|$|E
5|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned for September 13; <b>bad</b> weather delayed {{attempts}} until September 16. However, General Schuyler was {{by this time}} so ill that he thought it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler {{was not the only}} one falling ill; the <b>bad</b> weather, and the swampy, malaria-infested terrain of Île-aux-Noix was also taking a toll on the troops, as more of them became ill as well. The <b>bad</b> news was tempered by good; an additional 250 troops, in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{strategic}} model of network interdiction in a non-cooperative game of flow. An adversary, endowed with a bounded quantity of <b>bads,</b> chooses a flow specifying {{a plan for}} carrying <b>bads</b> through a network from a base to a target. Simultaneously, an agency chooses a blockage specifying a plan for blocking the transport of <b>bads</b> through arcs in the network. The <b>bads</b> carried to the target cause a target loss while the blocked arcs cause a network loss. The adversary earns and the agency loses from both target loss and network loss. The adversary incurs the expense of carrying <b>bads.</b> In this model we study Nash equilibria and find a power law relation between the probability {{and the extent of}} the target loss. Our model contributes to the literature of game theory by introducing non-cooperative behavior into a Kalai-Zemel (cooperative) game of flow. Our research also advances models and results on network interdiction. Network Interdiction, Noncooperative Game of Flow, Nash Equilibrium, Power Law, Kalai-Zemel Game of Flow...|$|R

5|$|After the break-up, Strummer {{contacted}} Jones in {{an effort}} to reform the Clash. Jones, however, had already formed a new band, Big Audio Dynamite (<b>B.A.D.),</b> that had released its debut late in 1985. The two did work together on their respective 1986 projects. Jones helped out with the two songs Strummer wrote and performed for the Sid and Nancy soundtrack. Strummer, in turn, cowrote a number of the tracks on the second <b>B.A.D.</b> album, No.10, Upping St., which he also co-produced. With Jones committed to <b>B.A.D.,</b> Strummer moved on to various solo projects and screen acting work. Simonon formed a band called Havana 3am. Headon recorded a solo album, before once again spiraling into drug abuse. Chimes drummed with a succession of different acts.|$|E
5|$|Ashford {{has been}} {{associated}} with the German town <b>Bad</b> Münstereifel since the 20th century. British forces occupied the town in 1919 under the command of Major J Goode, following the end of the war. Goode subsequently formed close friendships with some <b>Bad</b> Münstereifel residents. John Wiles, Major Goode's brother in law, later became mayor of New Romney in 1946, and subsequently arranged a visit to the Rhineland with Winston Churchill. Wiles arranged several other exchange visits between British and German families, at a time where travel between the two countries was rare. He was declared an honorary citizen of <b>Bad</b> Münstereifel in 1961, which led to the two towns being formally twinned in 1964. <b>Bad</b> Münstereifel was twinned with the French town of Fougères, Brittany two years later, which led to a twinning with Ashford in 1984.|$|E
