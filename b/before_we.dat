5|$|The Animals {{recorded}} {{a version of}} the song on their 1977 album <b>Before</b> <b>We</b> Were So Rudely Interrupted.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>we</b> see a {{full shot}} of Tracy, we see {{individual}} shots of her upraised {{right and left}} arms. This is reminiscent of our first views of Sadie Thompson (Joan Crawford) in the 1932 film Rain.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} episode, Wirt and Greg wake up in a hospital, with Greg telling a story but being cut off <b>before</b> <b>we</b> can hear what it's about. As the scene ends, Greg's frog begins to glow, due to having eaten a magic bell in The Unknown, {{suggesting}} that there was at least some physical aspect to the story. The series ends with a slow montage of how Wirt and Greg affected the inhabitants of the Unknown.|$|E
50|$|They {{released}} {{a number of}} albums for various labels <b>before</b> <b>Wes</b> Montgomery died in 1968.|$|R
50|$|But Wes sets a trap instead. He {{releases}} Enzo (Michael Malarkey), {{sending him}} to the classroom {{to deal with his}} own unresolved business with Damon. <b>Before</b> <b>Wes</b> sends him, he injects Enzo with poison telling him not to come back for the antidote unless he kills Damon.|$|R
30|$|<b>Before</b> {{proceeding}} <b>we</b> first {{prove the}} following lemma.|$|R
5|$|Maybe mid-year; {{safe to say}} {{towards the}} end {{but not at the}} end, maybe like eight months or {{something}} like that. Best thing about it is we’re going to do it whenever we want to do it. There is no deadline right now, we don’t have any dates set, we don’t have the studio, we’re going to do the record ourselves. So we will literally go in and record it and it will be probably be done <b>before</b> <b>we</b> sign a contract.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a spoilt child opening {{numerous}} Christmas presents including a toy train, a box full of kittens {{and a copy of}} Hey Venus! (which he throws over his shoulder in disgust). Towards the end of the video less privileged children are shown crying at their lack of presents <b>before</b> <b>we</b> cut back to the initial child who is surrounded by gifts while Santa Claus is seen in front of a log fire, crucified on a cross. An alternative ending instead features Santa lying on the floor with an arrow through his head.|$|E
5|$|We {{marched to}} the place we called Cornhill, where we had found the corn before. At another place we had seen <b>before,</b> <b>we</b> dug and found some more corn, two or three baskets full, {{and a bag of}} beans....In all we had about ten bushels, which will be enough for seed. It is with God's help that we found this corn, for how else could we have done it, without meeting some Indians who might trouble us.|$|E
30|$|<b>Before</b> proceeding, <b>we</b> need to {{introduce}} a few concepts.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{with the}} awful {{prospect}} of cannibalism <b>before</b> us, <b>we</b> drew lots.|$|R
50|$|League CupCounty lost in {{the first}} round away from home at neir {{neighbours}} Nottingham Forest but only after a highly exciting game. the two sides were level at 2-2 after 90 minutes so they went to extra time. Notts went 3-2 up, and were seconds away from victory <b>before</b> <b>Wes</b> Morgan equalised for Forest. County lost on penalties.|$|R
5|$|A {{narrative}} rational for {{the concept}} of Hell {{can be found in}} the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. This narrative ends with Yudhishthira's visit to hell after being offered acceptance into heaven. This journey creates a scene for the audience that helps illustrate the importance of understanding hell as well as heaven before accepting either extreme. This idea provides an essential lesson regarding Dharma, a primary theme within the Mahabharata. Dharma is not a black and white concept, and all people are not entirely good or entirely evil. As such, tolerance is essential in order to truly understand the “right way of living”. We all must understand the worst to truly understand and appreciate the best just as we must experience the best <b>before</b> <b>we</b> can experience the worst. This narrative utilizes the Hindu religion in order to teach lessons on tolerance and acceptance of one another's faults as well as virtues.|$|E
5|$|I {{think when}} you name a record, {{you have to choose}} {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You also want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since <b>before</b> <b>we</b> had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Usher {{flickering}} {{on a television}} in a room, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> see him in a scene dancing with blue flashing lights, and will.i.am. is shown in a similar room with red flashing lights. Usher is then shown with female background dancers in a white room. In the scene he dons a pair of glasses which show the dancers performing through the lens. Usher then dances outside {{in front of a}} concrete wall, with male background dancers appearing as shadows. As will.i.am. performs his verse, he and Usher are seen in their corresponding rooms with flashing lights. After this, Usher puffs a cigar and dances with male background dancers in an arena-like area, whilst he is also joined by female dancers with flashing lights on the floor, with the video ending with Usher shown on the flashing television.|$|E
60|$|If {{there was}} a world <b>before</b> this <b>we</b> must all have died impenitent.|$|R
30|$|<b>Before</b> beginning, <b>we</b> will go {{over the}} {{state-of-the-art}} of WSN power estimation tools.|$|R
30|$|Proof. The {{proof is}} {{completely}} similar as that <b>before,</b> so <b>we</b> {{leave out the}} details.|$|R
5|$|We {{always start}} out with a musical idea. Great effort goes into {{creating}} a solid melodic core. We both play the keyboards and program, but in general Mikkel plays the instruments and controls Pro Tools, while Tor has the executive overlook as well as lyrical input. However, we both are hands on and have no rules or limitations. When we have some killer beats and musical starting points, we hook up with one of our favorite topline writers, who gets cracking on the lyrics and melody. We make sure there's a lot of melody in the track, so it can inspire the writer. Together with the topline writer we work, often tweek and simplify the song, and never quit <b>before</b> <b>we</b> feel we've got a killer hook.|$|E
25|$|<b>Before</b> <b>we</b> {{discuss how}} Wiener's attack works, we will first briefly explain how RSA works. For more details see the main entry on the RSA cryptosystem.|$|E
25|$|Agricola {{was spared}} those later years during which Domitian, leaving now no {{interval}} or breathing space of time, but, as it were, with one continuous blow, drained the life-blood of the Commonwealth... It {{was not long}} before our hands dragged Helvidius to prison, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> gazed on the dying looks of Manricus and Rusticus, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> were steeped in Senecio's innocent blood. Even Nero turned his eyes away, and did not gaze upon the atrocities which he ordered; with Domitian it was the chief part of our miseries to see and to be seen, to know that our sighs were being recorded...|$|E
30|$|Here, we {{give the}} first inequalities’ {{refinements}} of (2.13). <b>Before</b> that, <b>we</b> need a lemma.|$|R

60|$|We {{drove on}} in the same {{direction}} as <b>before.</b> When <b>we</b> had started he turned to me.|$|R
25|$|From <b>before,</b> <b>we</b> {{already have}} the general {{solution}} to the homogeneous equation. Since {{the sum of the}} homogeneous and particular solutions give the general solution to the inhomogeneous problem, we now only need find the particular solution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Before</b> <b>we</b> {{introduced}} {{the testimony of}} our witnesses, we made them undergo independent verifying tests, including polygraph examination, truth serum and hypnosis. We thought this would be hailed as an unprecedented step in jurisprudence; instead, the press turned around and hinted that we had drugged our witnesses or given them posthypnotic suggestions to testify falsely.|$|E
25|$|In the {{a priori}} methods, we write a {{collision}} detection algorithm {{which will be}} able to predict very precisely the trajectories of the physical bodies. The instants of collision are calculated with high precision, and the physical bodies never actually interpenetrate. We call this a priori because we calculate the instants of collision <b>before</b> <b>we</b> update the configuration of the physical bodies.|$|E
60|$|<b>Before</b> evening, <b>we</b> had a {{visit from}} Inspector Stanley Hopkins. Things were not going very well with him.|$|R
30|$|We {{conclude}} {{this report}} by Question D. 2, due to Tullio Ceccherini-Silberstein. <b>Before</b> this, <b>we</b> recall some background.|$|R
30|$|The proof {{relies on}} the same {{techniques}} as <b>before,</b> so <b>we</b> provide only a sketch in Appendix 7.|$|R
25|$|The first {{limitation}} {{was that the}} movements and position of the heavenly bodies point to such occurrences as are of public import and affect the general welfare. The individual's interests are {{not in any way}} involved, and we must descend many centuries and pass beyond the confines of Babylonia and Assyria <b>before</b> <b>we</b> reach that phase which in medieval and modern astrology is almost exclusively dwelt upon—the individual horoscope.|$|E
25|$|<b>Before</b> <b>we</b> put real {{effort into}} the Severn Beach line {{it was really}} the {{sacrificial}} lamb for other services. So if we needed a spare train, we would pull one off the line and cancel it, which was why punctuality and reliability was so poor. After the public campaign in 2006 we decided that we didn't want to take that to carry on any more.|$|E
25|$|He {{procured}} me a Chinese interpreter, Fong Shi, {{a pleasant}} and agreeable young Chinaman, who wrote his mother-tongue with ease and spoke Jagatai Turki fluently, and—did not smoke opium. He left {{his wife and}} child behind him in Khotan, Liu Darin making himself answerable for their maintenance. But I also paid Fong Shi three months' salary in advance, and that money he gave to his wife. Whenever I could find leisure he was to give me lessons in Chinese, and we began at once, even <b>before</b> <b>we</b> left Khotan...........|$|E
60|$|Directly <b>before</b> us <b>we</b> saw a {{half dozen}} men--fierce, black-bearded fellows, with skins {{the color of a}} ripe lemon.|$|R
30|$|In {{this section}} {{we give the}} proof of Theorem 1.1. <b>Before</b> that, <b>we</b> need to {{establish}} some basic lemmas.|$|R
