Although Poles were much more skeptical than they had been in 1956, Gierek was believed to be an honest and well-intentioned man, and his promises bought him some time. He used this time to create a new economic program, one based on large-scale <b>borrowing</b> from banks in the West — mainly from the United States and West Germany — to buy technology that would upgrade Poland's production of export goods. This massive <b>borrowing,</b> estimated to have totaled over 24 billion US (1970s) dollars during Gierek's years, was used to re-equip and modernize Polish industry, and to import consumer goods to give the workers more incentive to work.|$|E
