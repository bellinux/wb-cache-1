50|$|Wire eye lags (also called {{screw thread}} <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> <b>eye</b> screws, or turned/bent eye lags) have a wood screw thread {{for use in}} wood or lag anchors. Like wire <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> wire <b>eye</b> lags are {{intended}} for light duty applications {{and should not be}} used for angular loads.|$|R
50|$|Zargoss Robo: Appear in episode 2, 8, 16, and 31. Powers include levitation, invisibility, {{underside}} energy <b>bolts,</b> <b>eye,</b> torso, and pelvis energy beams, {{and torso}} lasers.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} of several trigger {{mechanisms}} is two <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> and a peg through both <b>bolts.</b> The <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> are usually {{placed at the}} bottom of the frame, locking above the arm to prevent accidental release. In larger designs, the trigger system is applied at the top of the drop channel. Large scale designs require special trigger mechanisms that can hold the weight of the throwing arm.|$|R
50|$|Machinery <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{are fully}} {{threaded}} {{and may have}} a collar, making them suitable for use with angular loads up to 45°. <b>Eye</b> <b>bolts</b> without a shoulder {{should not be used}} for angular loads.|$|R
5000|$|A cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> is an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> {{typically}} {{used as a}} structural tie down [...] in building construction where the <b>eye</b> of the <b>bolt</b> must be fastened {{to a point that}} cannot be directly below where the shaft would otherwise be fastened. This often occurs where a bearer must be tied down to a post or column but the bearer cannot be directly fastened to the post of column.|$|R
50|$|Teyupon: Appears in episode 2. Powers include swimming, {{summoning}} the six robo birds, head lightning <b>bolts,</b> and <b>eye</b> lasers.|$|R
50|$|A turnbuckle, {{stretching}} screw or bottlescrew is {{a device}} for adjusting the tension or length of ropes, cables, tie rods, and other tensioning systems. It normally {{consists of two}} threaded <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> one screwed into each end of a small metal frame, one with a left-hand thread {{and the other with}} a right-hand thread. The tension can be adjusted by rotating the frame, which causes both <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> to be screwed in or out simultaneously, without twisting the <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> or attached cables.|$|R
5000|$|A ring <b>bolt</b> is an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> with {{a captive}} ring passing through it. The loose ring is articulated, {{such that it}} can rotate {{in at least one}} axis, and can thus reduce bending forces on the bolt when loaded and will present the minimum {{obstruction}} when [...] "flat".|$|R
50|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>bolts</b> made by bending a rod or wire into a loop {{are only}} {{suitable}} for light duty applications, as heavy loads {{can cause the}} eye to open. For high loads, <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> with forged or welded loops should be chosen, as they can withstand loads up to the tensile strength of the material {{of which they are}} made.|$|R
50|$|Cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{are made}} with {{different}} degrees of crank and lengths of shaft for flexibility.|$|R
50|$|Joint Long King: {{appears in}} episode 18. Powers include flight, coiling, and red {{electric}} <b>bolts</b> from the <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{unreleased}} vehicles later {{appeared in}} the series' gashapon line, which also had a special Spiral Zone super-deformed board game and other products not developed in 1:12 scale, such as new personal mecha units, weapon packs, and three figures (codenamed Zone <b>Bolt,</b> Eagle <b>Eye,</b> and Zone Acorn).|$|R
50|$|Today, cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> are now {{typically}} made by welding a cranked and {{threaded rod}} to a {{heavy gauge steel}} washer.|$|R
50|$|Heavy forged <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> with a {{continuous}} eye may be forged with an integral shoulder, allowing their use for heavy off-axis loads.|$|R
5000|$|Espalier {{plants on}} solid walls are usually {{installed}} six to twelve {{inches from the}} base of that wall, to allow space below ground for roots to grow in all directions as well as space above ground for good air circulation and pest control. [...] Supports for wire guides, which are generally necessary to train an espalier into a design, are installed first, directly into a wall constructed of suitable material. [...] Masonry walls are ideal for placing U-bolts, <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> or <b>eye</b> screws, anchored with either plastic plugs or expandable lead shields, directly into the mortar joints. [...] Wooden walls may be better fitted with galvanized nipples, using turnbuckles for adjustment of the wire tautness.|$|R
5000|$|Cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{used to be}} made by bending an [...] "eye" [...] {{into the}} end of a rod that was {{threaded}} at the other end.|$|R
50|$|Cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{can also}} be used to tie the top plate of a house frame {{directly}} to house supports, using rod couplers and steel extension rods.|$|R
5000|$|She {{designed}} {{a necklace of}} an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> on a chain, meant to represent [...] "strength without a fist"; she gave {{the first of these}} to Arlene Raven and Judy Chicago when they started the Feminist Studio Workshop in 1972. Since then she has given them to other women with whom she shares a vision of the creation of women's culture. Members of the Feminist Studio Workshop of 1978-79 also made 500 of these necklaces to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the Woman's Building in Los Angeles. The feminist art group Sisters of Jam (Mikaela & Moa Krestesen) turned the necklace into a mobile monument; they see the <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> [...] "as a symbol for the work already done but also as an encouragement for the work that is not yet completed." [...] Sisters of Jam also did the installation [...] "Hello Sheila", which features an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> on a chain, at the Survival Kit Festival in Umeå in 2014.|$|R

50|$|An <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> is a bolt with a loop at one end. They {{are used}} to firmly attach a {{securing}} eye to a structure, so that ropes or cables may then be tied to it.|$|R
5000|$|Reikai Beast: This monster {{appeared}} in episode 43. Its powers include using souls {{as a human}} disguise with extending arms, energy draining <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> telekinesis, teleportation, a pitch fork, high jumping, reviving dead makai beasts, and a sword.|$|R
5000|$|... 1875 : Half Dome in Yosemite National Park was climbed by George Anderson. He used <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> in {{drilled holes}} as hand and toe holds. He used a fixed rope {{to return to}} his high point each day.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Pigtail' <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> are {{a form of}} bent loop {{where the}} ends are not closed, but {{multiple}} turns are used to prevent a rope slipping out. They allow a rope to be threaded into the loop, even if its ends are already attached elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the first}} actions of Superintendent Sumner Increase Kimball, the only {{superintendent}} of the U.S. Life-Saving Service, {{was to find a}} better line-throwing device. Kimball realized he needed the best artillery expertise available, so he engaged the help of the Army Board of Ordnance and in 1877 they assigned David A. Lyle, First Lieutenant, U.S.A (1845-1937), a West Point and MIT graduate who began research and testing that resulted in reliable efficient designs. Lyle developed 3 bronze, smooth-bore guns of different sizes and the 2+1/2 in gun became the USLSS standard line-throwing gun. Projectiles for the gun were made of cast iron with a wrought iron <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> screwed into the base as an attachment point for the shot line. The projectile for the 2+1/2 in gun was 15+3/4 in long and weighed [...] It was placed into the 24 in gun barrel so the <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> with the line attached was sticking out. After firing, the projectile rotated so that the <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> and line were trailing. The gun had a large recoil from firing. A standard charge of 1.5 oz of gunpowder would knock the gun back 6 ft. The maximum rescue charge of 8 oz would send the gun flying back even further.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{are often}} {{installed}} into masonry and so versions that {{form their own}} anchor bolt are commonly available. Most of these screw into some form of shield anchor. Some lightweight forms are not screwed, but rely on just the pull on the ring itself to expand the anchor.|$|R

5000|$|The {{requirement}} for an offset tie down will occur when vermin proofing {{must be placed}} between the column or post, and a wooden bearer, for example to stop termites travelling up through a concrete or wooden post or column directly into the bearer {{and the rest of}} the building. The [...] "ant capping", typically a 0.5mm to 0.8mm thick galvanised steel sheet, must be placed between the post and the bearer overlapping the perimeter of the post by approximately 20mm to 40mm or more. The cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> is fastened to the post using a <b>bolt</b> though the <b>eye,</b> the crank in the shaft allowing the shaft to be positioned so that it does not impede the overlap of the [...] "ant capping" [...] up through the bearer.|$|R
50|$|On July 29, around 6 p.m., Li {{got off the}} bus in Erickson, Manitoba, with {{at least}} three pieces of luggage, and stayed the night on a bench next to a grocery store. According to one witness, he was seen at 3 a.m. sitting <b>bolt</b> upright with <b>eyes</b> wide open.|$|R

40|$|Aveng Manufacturing Duraset Company, a {{division}} of the Aveng Group is located in Alberton, South Africa. Aveng Manufacturing Duraset specializes in the manufacturing of support (reinforcement) and suspension products mainly used within the mining industry, worldwide. Some of these products include: Rock Studs, Rock <b>Bolts,</b> Rope <b>Eye</b> <b>Bolts</b> and Pigtails each with their sub section of components. Safety is {{a major factor in the}} success of Aveng Manufacturing Duraset. This project will aim to smooth the general workflow of raw materials and products throughout the manufacturing process and also the general control and allocation of stock and inventory with, if time allows it, a simulation model for a recommendation of a new and improved manufacturing system would be included. This will be achieved by using the various relevant Industrial Engineering methods, tools and problem solving techniques gathered and learned in the BEng Industrial Degree thus far. This report will show the author’s recommendation to the current problems at Duraset Manufacturing. System improvements, whether it is the decrease of idle times, increase in productivity and output of finished products, by eliminating bottlenecks and implementing new technology, simple, basic designs and equipment, even the control of finished products, good housekeeping and accurate stock data in whichever way possible, that should provide Aveng Manufacturing Duraset with one of many solutions.
