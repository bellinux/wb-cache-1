5|$|Dead Island: Official Announcement Trailer is an {{announcement}} trailer for the 2011 video game Dead Island, which {{was developed by}} Techland and published <b>by</b> <b>Deep</b> Silver. The story of the trailer follows a family who is attacked by a horde of zombies in a hotel. The trailer ends with the infected daughter, who {{has turned into a}} zombie, being thrown to her death from a hotel window. The trailer was produced by Glasgow-based Axis Animation, with music created by Giles Lamb.|$|E
5|$|Flagstaff has {{a rather}} dry semi-continental climate (Köppen Dsb/Csb). Flagstaff has five {{distinct}} seasons: {{a cold and}} snowy winter, with extended dry periods punctuated <b>by</b> <b>deep</b> snows about once every 3–4 weeks; a dry and windy spring with occasional snows; a very dry and hot early summer from May to early July; a wet and humid monsoon season from July to early September; and a dry and pleasant fall which lasts until the first snows in November.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, NASA {{scientists}} {{identified the}} crater formed <b>by</b> <b>Deep</b> Impact in images from Stardust. The crater {{is estimated to}} be 150 meters (500ft) in diameter, and has a bright mound in the center likely created when material from the impact fell back into the crater.|$|E

5|$|Similar alloys {{with the}} {{addition}} of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive. For building facades, roofing, and other applications for sheet metal formed <b>by</b> <b>deep</b> drawing, roll forming, or bending, zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used. Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes.|$|E
5|$|Around 1200UTC the {{following}} day, Linfa further intensified into a severe tropical storm. A microwave satellite {{image of the}} storm depicted an eye-feature surrounded <b>by</b> <b>deep</b> convection. Interacting with a nearby upper-level low, poleward outflow significantly improved late on June19, fueling further strengthening. Slowly tracking in a general northward direction, Linfa continued to organize and by June20, the JTWC upgraded Linfa to a typhoon. A small, ragged eye appeared on visible satellite images by this time and several hours later, the storm reached its peak intensity just below typhoon-status according to the JMA. Maximum sustained winds peaked at 110km/h (70mph 10-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 975hPa (mbar).|$|E
5|$|Ashot III {{established}} the Kingdom of Lori (Tashir-Dzoraget Kingdom) in Gugark for strategic reasons and enthroned Gurgen in 982. Gurgen {{along with his}} brother Smbat are depicted on the sculptures of the patrons in both Sanahin and Haghpat. When the Tashir-Dzoraget kingdom fell {{as a result of}} Seljuk raids the Kyurikids migrated to Tavush and Metsnaberd yet they maintained ties with their ancestral fortress and compound in Akhtala. The fortress was built on an elevated rocky outcrop surrounded <b>by</b> <b>deep</b> canyons from three sides forming a natural protection. The somewhat accessible parts between the cliffs are reinforced by towers and walls. The only entrance to the compound is on the northern side protected by bell-shaped towers and walls. The walls and towers of the fortress are built of bluish basalt and lime mortar. The Kyurikids gradually lost their influence under the Seljuk grasp {{by the end of the}} 12th century.|$|E

5|$|Back in Washington, both Scully and Mulder {{report to}} Section Chief McGrath, {{who does not}} believe their claims. McGrath offers an {{especially}} harsh reprimand to Mulder, and presents written testimony by Henderson claiming that Max's {{body was found in}} a cargo container. McGrath and his disciplinary board decide to shut down the X-Files and dismiss Mulder from the FBI, but the decision is vetoed <b>by</b> <b>Deep</b> Throat, who feels it would be more dangerous for them to allow Mulder to turn whistleblower than to let him continue his work.|$|E
5|$|Clare Castle {{was built}} between the River Stour and the Chilton Stream {{and took the}} form of a motte and bailey design, with two baileys rather than the more common one. The motte is 850 feet (259 m) wide at the base and 100 feet (30 m) tall, with its flat summit 63 feet (19 m) across. The two baileys, {{stretching}} alongside from the motte along the north and east, were protected <b>by</b> <b>deep</b> ditches and steep palisades, with either a causeway or a drawbridge linking the inner to the outer bailey; the inner bailey was also sheltered by the curve of the Chilton.|$|E
5|$|Coropuna is drained <b>by</b> <b>deep</b> gorges, {{with water}} {{eventually}} reaching the Arma and Majes rivers, {{both of which}} empty into the Pacific Ocean. During the dry season, Coropuna's glaciers are {{a major source of}} water for the region, and concern has been raised that their disappearance may result in water shortages at a time when population growth has increased water consumption and begun to create conflict over water distribution. 30,000 people depend on the Coropuna glacier in one way or the other, 8,000 of them just for their water supply.|$|E

5|$|Defenders of Ardania is {{a hybrid}} tower defense and {{real-time}} strategy video {{game for the}} Windows PC, iOS, Xbox Live Arcade, and PlayStation Network. It was developed by Most Wanted Entertainment and published <b>by</b> <b>Deep</b> Silver and Paradox Interactive. The game was released December 6, 2011 for the iOS and on March 14, 2012 on all other platforms. Defenders of Ardania has an ESRB rating of Teen, a PEGI rating of 12, and a USK rating of 12. The game's iOS release was well received by some critics and poorly received by others. A subsequent release on the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 was significantly less well received.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} the Kaqchikel served as loyal {{allies of the}} K'iche' Maya. The growing power of the Kaqchikel within the {{alliance}} eventually caused such friction that the Kaqchikel were forced to flee the K'iche' capital and found the city of Iximche. The Kaqchikel established their new capital upon an easily defensible ridge almost surrounded <b>by</b> <b>deep</b> ravines. Iximche developed quickly as a city and within 50 years of its foundation it had reached its maximum extent. The rulers of Iximche were four principal lords drawn from the four main clans of the Kaqchikel, although it was the lords of the Sotz'il and Xahil clans who held the real power.|$|E
5|$|However the Golden Path's newfound {{momentum}} is threatened <b>by</b> <b>deep</b> divisions between its commanders, Sabal, who favors traditional values, and Amita (Janina Gavankar), who argues for progress, which includes relying heavily on drug trade. Ajay {{is forced to}} intervene on several occasions, with his decisions influencing the direction the Golden Path takes. The first governor to fall is De Pleur after Noore helps Ajay {{find a way to}} infiltrate De Pleur's stronghold, allowing the rebellion to capture him. Amita and Sabal later task Ajay with confronting and killing Noore. She dies in her fighting arena, either with Ajay killing her, or with Noore committing suicide upon learning Pagan had her family executed years beforehand.|$|E

5|$|In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, {{students}} and entrepreneurs presented a fully automatic, prototype vending machine that cooks frozen potato strips <b>by</b> <b>deep</b> frying them. The final product is served with mayonnaise, ketchup or curry. The process takes around two minutes {{from start to}} finish, in which the product is served in a paper cup. The potato strips are stored in a frozen state inside the machine at −18°C, and it cooks them in oil at 180°C. The unit uses a specially-designed dispenser to prevent the potatoes from being crushed or broken. As of September 2015, only the single prototype is available, which is housed at Wageningen University. Orders are placed using a touchscreen, and a fork and salt are provided separately in a box.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{as part of}} the {{construction}} of what is now the Northern line, the CCE was extended south to Waterloo and Kennington where it was connected to the City & South London Railway. The loop tunnel under the river was abandoned (although the present northbound Northern line platform follows its course) and two new tunnels were bored south. To this day the southbound Northern line platform {{is the only one of}} the four deep level platforms that is not connected to any of the others <b>by</b> <b>deep</b> level walkways. The new extension was opened on 13 September 1926.|$|E
5|$|In the {{southern}} part of Asia including Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, crickets are commonly eaten as a snack, prepared <b>by</b> <b>deep</b> frying the soaked and cleaned insects. In Thailand, there are 20,000 farmers rearing crickets, with an estimated production of 7,500 tons per year and United Nation's FAO has implemented a project in Laos to improve cricket farming and consequently food security. The food conversion efficiency of house crickets (Acheta domesticus) is 1.7, some five times higher than that for beef cattle, and if their fecundity is taken into account, 15 to 20 times higher.|$|E

5|$|Jilotepeque Viejo {{was settled}} by the Chajoma {{in order to}} provide a capital that was safer from attack from the hostile Iximche Kaqchikel kingdom than their {{previous}} capital. In spite of this, the city fell under the domination of Iximche and the city's architecture, spread in a number of fortified groups along a ridge surrounded <b>by</b> <b>deep</b> ravines, shows a mixture of Chajoma and Kaqchikel styles. At the time of the Spanish conquest, the Chajoma of Jilotepeque Viejo may have initially allied themselves with the Spanish together with Iximche and have joined in the general Kaqchikel uprising against the Spanish in 1524. The site was abandoned after the conquest and never reoccupied.|$|E
5|$|North American forecasters, however {{surprised}} as they were, considered this storm a hurricane immediately upon reviewing the satellite-derived evidence. Since Catarina {{had a clear}} eyewall structure bounded <b>by</b> <b>deep</b> convective, dense central overcast, well-defined spiral outer bands and outflow structure, warm water temperatures of 79°F (26°C), little shear, a warm core low, overall tropical characteristics, and occurred in March (equivalent to September in the Northern Hemisphere, the peak of hurricane season), it {{was considered to be}} a hurricane by the National Hurricane Center in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Notable in Western Chalukya {{architecture}} are {{the decorative}} door panels that {{run along the}} length of the door and over on top to form a lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled fretwork, moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed with tiny figures. The bands are separated <b>by</b> <b>deep</b> narrow channels and grooves and run over the top of the door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected outward from the roof of the open mantapa. This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from pouring in between the pillars. The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.|$|E
