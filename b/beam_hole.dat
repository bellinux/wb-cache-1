The cavity was used to observe the effects on beam position when slow (0. 01 Hz) sinusoidal disturbances were applied to three accelerator parameters: forward power, frequency and phase.

Although traditionally in New Zealand {{it has been}} the main choice for residential construction, with recently introduced engineered wood products like Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL), the use of timber has developed to other sectors like commercial, industrial, and multi-story buildings. The application of timber in office and commercial buildings poses some challenges with requirements for long span timber <b>beams</b> yet with <b>holes</b> to pass services. The current construction practice with timber is not properly suited for the aforementioned types of structures.

Experimental and numerical investigation is required to address the problem properly.

40|$|Beta {{delayed neutron}} {{emission}} probability {{is one of}} the main properties of neutron rich nuclei away from the valley of beta stability. The knowledge of this parameter provides the opportunity to extend the information on: the structure of atomic nuclei and its dependence with the N/Z ratio; the rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis process (r-process), and hence study the formation of nuclei in supernova explosions; new data for reactor technology applications, since {{is one of the}} key features for the safe operation of actual nuclear power plants. The objective of the thesis was to design and test a prototype of a 4 p neutron detector for DESPEC experiments related with the measurement of beta delayed neutron emission probabilities. As the neutron emission probabilities are low and the neutron energies are not well known, it is necessary to design a detector with high neutron detection efficiency, and a low dependence with neutron energy for a wide neutron energy ranges. The prototype designed has a mean neutron detection efficiency of the order of 27. 1 % and is flat for neutron energies ranging from thermal values to 6 MeV. The detector designed is composed by 20 3 He proportional counters at 20 atm, inserted in a polyethylene matrix. The counters are distributed in 2 concentric rings, surrounding a <b>beam</b> <b>hole</b> located at the central axis of the matrix This Master Thesis is divided in three main steps: 1) the analysis of different detector configurations and properties; 2) the selection of the definitive configuration of detector prototype, including the electronics and data acquisition system (DAQ); 3) the test of prototype and calibration with neutron sources. The detector configuration analysis has been done by means of Monte Carlo simulations with the code MCNPX. These MC simulations were useful to find: the optimal pressure of 3 He counters; the best number of counters, taking in account the cost and the maximum neutron detection efficiency achievable; the number of counters in each concentric ring, and the distance of rings to the center of polyethylene matrix; the optimal counter length; or the shielding thickness for background radiation reduction. All of these studies were basic to obtain the optimal neutron detector configuration. The design of the detector also involved the selection of the most suitable electronics and Data Acquisition System (DAQ), as is described in this Thesis. This activity was done with the collaboration of the "Instituto de Física Corpuscular (IFIC- Valencia) ". This PhD.

In covered fighting platforms there were similarly located window openings {{in place of the}} merlons that gave a panoramic view of the surrounding area and enabled the use of long-distance weapons (Idstein Castle, Sayn Castle). Some surviving ledges or <b>beam</b> <b>holes</b> on bergfrieds indicate, in some cases, that wooden superstructures were used.
