5|$|Any {{mechanical}} component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness. This translates in electrical terms to an LC circuit, that is, a circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, hence {{mechanical component}}s are resonators {{and are often}} used as such. It is still possible to represent inductors and capacitors as individual lumped elements in a mechanical implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. Capacitors may <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> short, wide pieces which maximise the mass {{in comparison to the}} compliance of the piece.|$|E
5|$|A {{circular}} {{hole was}} {{cut into the}} backdrop {{and covered with a}} transparent material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon. The light was occasionally manipulated to suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene.|$|E
5|$|A {{subscription}} {{was raised}} across Glamorgan {{to pay for}} a statue to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> him, which was erected in Cardiff's High Street in 1853, outside the town hall. In 2000 the statue, Cardiff's oldest, was moved to Bute Square, but the location was renamed Callaghan Square in 2002, leading to proposals from local officials that Bute's statue might be better relocated once again, potentially to outside Cardiff Castle.|$|E

5|$|As the goalkeeper has {{the choice}} of how many hands they want to use, the {{decision}} should <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> {{what they want to}} do. A shot should be stopped with two hands either if it is weak or close to the goalkeeper's body, and normally stopped with one in other circumstances. This is because one-handed saves can go to the ball faster.|$|E
5|$|Both {{resident}} and transient orangutans aggregate on large fruiting trees to feed. The fruits {{tend to be}} abundant, so competition is low and individuals may engage in social interactions. Orangutans will also form travelling groups with members moving between different food sources. These groups tend to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> only a few individuals. They {{also tend to be}} consortships between an adult male and female.|$|E

5|$|The low {{weight and}} high {{rigidity}} of beryllium make it {{useful as a}} material for high-frequency speaker drivers. Because beryllium is expensive (many times more than titanium), hard to shape due to its brittleness, and toxic if mishandled, beryllium tweeters are limited to high-end home, pro audio, and public address applications. Some high-fidelity products have been fraudulently claimed to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> the material.|$|E

5|$|According to the Accident Investigation Board Norway, {{the rescue}} work was {{hampered}} by, among other things: lack of fire crew at Voss {{to drive the}} fire engine, a defective helicopter bucket, and a three-hour delay from the fire to a rail carriage with water was sent from Ål. Also, the fire carriage from Voss arrived six hours after the accident was reported. Concerns were raised regarding the fire hazards of wooden snow tunnels, and the National Rail Administration admitted that they should <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> a more fire-proof material, such as concrete or steel. Following the accident, the National Rail Administration decided that all welding {{would have to be}} monitored for several hours after completion of the work.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} small sizes and {{high rates of}} reproduction, thrips are {{difficult}} to control using classical biological control. Suitable predators must be small and slender enough to penetrate the crevices where thrips hide while feeding, and they must also prey extensively on eggs and larvae to be effective. Only two families of parasitoid Hymenoptera parasitize eggs and larvae, the Eulophidae and the Trichogrammatidae. Other biocontrol agents of adults and larvae include anthocorid bugs of genus Orius, and phytoseiid mites. Biological insecticides such as the fungi Beauveria bassiana and Verticillium lecanii can kill thrips at all life-cycle stages. Insecticidal soap spray is effective against thrips. It is commercially available or can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> certain types of household soap. Scientists in Japan report that significant reductions in larva and adult melon thrips occur when plants are illuminated with red light.|$|E

5|$|From {{her first}} sight of Florida, Stowe was greatly impressed. In Palmetto Leaves, she sings the praises of Florida in January as a {{beautiful}} land capable of producing superior citrus and flowers. In several letters Stowe describes the abundant plant life in the area, dedicating a chapter to yellow jessmines (Gelsemium sempervirens) and another to magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) flowers. She details watching sugarcane pressed into sugar crystals, going visiting with her elderly and obstinate mule named Fly, and discovering the myriad things {{to find in the}} woods and what can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> them. She also keeps a cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) in a cage and four cats, but sadly reports later in the year that all four cats have died, to the relief and joy of Phœbus the cardinal.|$|E
5|$|Gay {{caused a}} special study to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> this action because he {{considered}} it so outstanding. He {{found that the}} 3d Battalion suffered 229 battle casualties {{in the first two}} hours. Of these, 38 troops were killed and 167 wounded, the remainder were attached South Koreans. The battalion aid station reported treating 130 casualties. Other wounded were treated at the 8th Cavalry aid station. Many men with minor wounds did not ask for medical attention until the battle had ended, and there were only five cases of combat shock in contrast to the eighteen on Hill 518. North Korean mortar fire caused 80 percent of the casualties.|$|E
5|$|It rained. The {{procession}} of weary soldiers became a bedraggled train, despondent and muttering, marching with churning effort in a trough of liquid brown mud under a low, wretched sky. Yet the youth smiled, for {{he saw that}} the world was a world for him, though many discovered it to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> oaths and walking sticks. He had rid himself of the red sickness of battle. The sultry nightmare was in the past. He had been an animal blistered and sweating in the heat and pain of war. He turned now with a lover's thirst to images of tranquil skies, fresh meadows, cool brooks, an existence of soft and eternal peace.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter has a faint {{planetary}} ring system composed of three main segments: an inner torus of particles {{known as the}} halo, a relatively bright main ring, and an outer gossamer ring. These rings appear to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> dust, rather than ice as with Saturn's rings. The main ring is probably made of material ejected from the satellites Adrastea and Metis. Material that would normally fall back to the moon is pulled into Jupiter because of its strong gravitational influence. The orbit of the material veers towards Jupiter and new material is added by additional impacts. In a similar way, the moons Thebe and Amalthea probably produce the two distinct components of the dusty gossamer ring. There is also evidence of a rocky ring strung along Amalthea's orbit which may consist of collisional debris from that moon.|$|E
5|$|Major General Charles Richard Fox {{proposed}} {{during the}} exhibition that a bronze cast should <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> the statue {{to serve as}} a memorial to the exhibition, marking one end of the site of the Crystal Palace with a statue of Prince Albert at the other end. A campaign got underway two years later, in May 1853, with a variety of the great and the good signing a brochure promoting a scheme to erect the statue somewhere in London. Its supporters included the Duke of Sutherland, Lord Lansdowne, the Earl of Shaftesbury, the sculptor John Henry Foley, the novelist William Makepeace Thackeray, the ceramic manufacturer William Taylor Copeland and the Conservative MP (and future Prime Minister) Benjamin Disraeli. The Times was strongly in favour of the project due to the influence of its foreign affairs reporter Henry Reeve, who had known Marochetti since as early as 1839. The Royal Family also {{let it be known that}} they were supporters, with Queen Victoria donating £200 and Prince Albert £100.|$|E
5|$|Mention {{should also}} <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> Meyerbeer's intense {{concern with the}} {{business}} of opera, which indeed had formed part of his studies under Vogler. This gave him the background not only to deal with complex contractual issues and to negotiate with publishers, but extended to wooing the press and 'marketing' in general. Indeed, he was probably the originator of the 'press conference' at which journalists were fed refreshment and information. This marketing and commercialisation of opera was reinforced by Meyerbeer's Paris publisher Maurice Schlesinger who had established his fortune on the back of Robert, and even persuaded Honoré de Balzac to write a novella (Gambara) to promote Les Huguenots. Schlesinger's publication of Franz Liszt's Reminiscences de Robert le diable sold out on the day of issue and was immediately reprinted. Such manoeuvres did little to endear Meyerbeer to his fellow artists, and indeed engendered envious comments of the sort already quoted from Berlioz and Chopin.|$|E
