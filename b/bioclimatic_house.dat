Viability studies and guidelines of bioclimatic houses are given for the realization of this house in the Nordic countries.  A study of insulating materials and composition of the enclosures of the <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>house</b> is carried out  complying  with  the  Swedish  norm.   To  achieve  the  building  envelope  criteria  of  high  insulation and passive house construction are followed. Calculations of thermal transmittance, considering the geographical situation of the house, in a Nordic country, like Sweden are performed. One  method  to  obtain  the  energy  demand  of  buildings  is  to  use  computer  software.   A  graphic interface called DesignBuilder v 3. 01. This software is utilized to study the importance of insulation and orientation {{in relation to the}} energy demand in a <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>house.</b> In  accordance  with  the  bioclimatic  construction,  renewable  energy  sources  are  chosen  to  supply electricity to the dwelling. This is to reduce the environmental impact and the ecological footprint of the household. To achieve this, three different alternatives are chosen. In addition, another goal is to study economic viability and possible agreements with an energy company in order to sell excess of energy.  A final result of the study and evaluation of the three different systems to provide energy and passive house strategies is obtained. According to the economic aspect, the <b>Bioclimatic</b> <b>house</b> should have a passive house envelope, facing south and a system combining of windmill turbine, solar photovoltaic panels and geothermal energy. The construction of bioclimatic houses helps to reduce the anthropogenic CO 2   emissions. In addition, the construction of bioclimatic houses is one way to achieve an ecologically sustainable future...|$|E

Controlling solar protections and ventilation is therefore becoming essential. In this publication, we study the possibility to maintain comfort in the building by controlling either mechanical ventilation for night cooling or solar protections or both of them during hot periods. The proposed energy management is a predictive set of optimal commands issued from a dynamic programming optimization knowing in advance the weather, occupation and internal gains for the next 24 hours.

40|$|In the Romanian {{architectural}} {{practice for}} individual houses in residential areas, designing the architectural object {{in order to}} function together with the nature is neglected {{in the majority of}} the situations. This happens despite of a great variety of the solar bioclimatic solutions materialized in the traditional houses of all the Romanian geographical regions in a history of over 2000 years of traditional architecture. Unfortunately, in the local real estate realities, other choices are preferred in instead those of the solar bioclimatic architecture. The approach starts with a historical approach, analyzing several examples of traditional houses from all the regions of Romania, in order to identify the traditional bioclimatic solutions used to better adapt to the environment. This constitutes the source of inspiration for the modern cheap type solar <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>houses</b> presented.

40|$|Traditional {{architecture}} {{is adapted to}} the cultural and climatic environment. It was {{able to respond to}} the conditions of minimal comfort of its inhabitants. This architecture contains centuries of knowledge to encourage researchers to make out its secret and evaluate its energy efficiency. In Tunisian context, pioneering work analysis concerning traditional houses, have shown that comfort conditions were acceptable during the hot season and mediocre during the cold season. Other studies have shown that this kind of architecture was able to respond to winter and summer climate requirements, but especially in the summer period, in coherence with the lifestyle of residents. Several study models concerning the thermal behavior of buildings are found in the literature. These models use software for simulating stationary regime or transient. Each program has its own interface and its own modeling engine, calculation and analysis, as TRNSYS (Transient System Simulation Tool) and EnergyPlus. For the simulation, we opted for sustainable software that allows architects and engineers to collaborate and interoperate more efficiently based on workflow and project requirements. The use solution is the BIM (Building Information Modeling) of Autodesk Revit that allows coordination throughout the design project. Our paper examines the effectiveness of promising new technology BIM in the thermal simulation of traditional Tunisian architecture bioclimatic. Research has showed the importance of BIM technology in the workflow and is efficiency to determine the energy performance of buildings with passive design and to evaluate their energy consumption. Revit gives interesting results for the standard contemporary home. As far as it knows, there are no studies on the traditional <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>house</b> or vernacular character using BIM technology for simulate this type of habitat. In this paper, we propose to use Revit to study the thermal behavior of the Tunisian traditional home. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Basrah’s {{climate is}} hot, dry summer, mild to cold winter, and a {{pleasant}} spring and fall. The old builders from this region putted a big {{effort to create}} passive <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>houses</b> that corresponds the negative effects Basrah’s macroclimate. The courtyard is the central and dominant space in the house plan with a {{direct access to the}} living spaces. Houses from the city are compact with interior courtyard; the streets are sinuous and pass through houses volumes. The shady interior courtyard has the effect that the rooms do not communicate directly with the overheated air outside, but through intermediate buffer spaces. In the mean time between courtyard and street at least a wall or a building is always interposed. The House plan had an endomorphic form, (open tree form). The volumes were concept to create shadow which helps to move the air by natural movement to the deep superior side, that can be achieve through special holes. The architectural elements are strongly decorated, reproducing special typologies and traditional houses. Open spaces, covered by large roofs, are interesting due to the mix of diffuse light and shade that are an essential aesthetic factor in these buildings...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{both the}} technical and sociocultural aspects of Aboriginal housing in hot dry climates, posing the question: can domestic living patterns and preferences be harnessed to reduce domestic energy consumption? The colonial history of housing Aboriginal people in Australia is rife with precedents that are unsuccessful on multiple levels. Research has highlighted the frequent mismatch between modern housing types and the sociocultural traditions of Aboriginal households. In arid and semi-arid regions, the majority of Aboriginal housing is poorly designed for the climate, yet this aspect of shelter has received limited scholarly attention. The design of <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>houses</b> that support cultural patterns is still an architectural challenge, complicated by diverse historical and economic conditions. Additionally, the increasing cost of energy causes economic stresses for public housing occupants. Current climate change models for Australian arid regions predict increasing temperatures and less predictable rainfall patterns, which provide further challenges for low-energy housing design. Using recent survey data on Aboriginal housing in Northwest Queensland, this paper examines the design implications of using both sociocultural and technical factors to improve living environments and reduce energy consumption. The integrated design of buildings in landscaped yards can both mitigate overheating and support socio-cultural practices that affect overall residential energy consumption. Despite a general consensus on the significance of external living environments in the literature, there is lack of evidence from research that measures culturally derived adaptive strategies to reduce residential energy consumption in Aboriginal housing...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{issue of}} this thesis {{concerns}} {{one of the fundamental}} problems of the future of our society: How to meet the energy requirements for a large and growing world population while preserving our environment? This question is important for the world and the answers are complex and interwoven. Conventional energy sources, fossil and fissile, are polluting in the present and in the future: they erode the environment and their resources are limited. Renewable energy (hydro, wind, solar, geothermal) constitutes a minimum of pollution in the different energy systems. The technologies for using renewable energy are well known though further development and progress are made. This development also requires behavioural change, adaptation, and above all political will. The transition from an economy based on fossil energy to an economy based on renewable energy appears necessary {{for the protection of the}} environment. The cost of renewable energy is often represented as an obstacle but remains competitive in the long run. The development and availability of renewable energy, which varies because of its spatial and temporal distribution, require an adaptation of lifestyle, habits, habitat design (passive <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>houses),</b> urban planning and transportation. The focus of this thesis was to apply renewable energy in an area with hot summers and cold winter, a climate like that in the northwest of Algeria. In order to provide improved comfort in the buildings and also economic development in this area, the energy demand for heating and cooling was analyzed in the ancient city of Tlemcen. To supply domestic hot water and space heating, water must be simultaneously available at two different temperature levels. Cold water temperature, close to that of the atmosphere, and hot water between 50 and 60 °C. An interesting feature of the preparation of hot water is the small variation of requirements during the year, unlike that to heating. The preparation of hot water is one of the preferred applications of solar energy in the building for several reasons. For this reason an experimental study of the thermal behaviour of a domestic hot water storage tank was undertaken. The phenomena that affect the thermal behaviour of tank especially the coupling between the solar collector and storage tank was studied. This study included concentrating solar collector in which optical fibers were used to transport the energy to the storage tank. Another technology was introduced and developed for the heating and cooling of buildings in the desert involving an existing ancient irrigation system called Fouggara. The novel idea is to use the Fouggara as an air conditioner by pumping ambient air through this underground system. Then air at a temperature of about 21 °C would be supplied to the building for heating in the winter and cooling in the summer. This study shows the feasibility of using this ancient irrigation system of Fouggara and contributes to reducing and eliminating the energy demand for heating and cooling buildings in the Sahara desert.
