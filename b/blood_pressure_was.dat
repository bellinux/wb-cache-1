In 2009 she was hospitalised again when she fell and broke her arm.

Stone previously painted portraits of the Queen and the Queen Mother.|$|E
5|$|From March 1958 Formby {{appeared}} in the musical comedy Beside the Seaside, a Holiday Romp in Hull, Blackpool, Birmingham and Brighton. By the time it reached Brighton the play was playing to increasingly small audiences, and the run was cut short as a result. The play {{may not have been}} to southern audiences' tastes—the plot centres on a northern family's holiday in Blackpool—and the Brighton audiences may have been too small, but those in the north, particularly Blackpool, thought highly of it and the show was a nightly sell-out. When the show closed Formby was disappointed, and vowed never to appear in another stage musical. The year 1958 was professionally quiet for him; in addition to Beside the Seaside, he also worked in one-off appearances in three television shows. He began 1959 by appearing in Val Parnell's Spectacular: The Atlantic Showboat in January, and in April hosted his own show, Steppin' Out With Formby. During the summer season he appeared at the Windmill Theatre, Great Yarmouth, although he missed two weeks of performances when he was involved in a car crash on the August Bank Holiday. When doctors examined him, they were concerned with his overall health, {{partly as a result of}} his forty cigarettes-a-day smoking habit. He also had high <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>was</b> overweight and had heart problems.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> {{measured}} non-invasively using a {{mercury manometer}} {{and this is}} still generally considered the gold standard. More recently other semi-automated methods have become common, largely due to concerns about potential mercury toxicity, although cost {{and ease of use}} have also influenced this trend. Early alternatives to mercury sphygmomanometers were often inaccurate, but more modern validated devices have similar accuracy to mercury devices.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> {{expressed}} by two measurements, the systolic and diastolic <b>pressures,</b> which <b>are</b> the maximum and minimum <b>pressures,</b> respectively. Normal <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> at rest <b>is</b> {{within the range}} of 100-140 millimeters mercury (mmHg) systolic and 60-90 mmHg diastolic. High <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> present if the resting <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> persistently at or above 140/90 mmHg for most adults. Different numbers apply to children. Ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring over a 24-hour period appears more accurate than office best <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement.|$|R
50|$|High <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> {{hypertension}} - One-third of {{all cases}} of high <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>are</b> associated with obesity. High <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> twice as common in adults who are obese than in those who are at a healthy weight.|$|R
50|$|This {{measurement}} {{suggests the}} opposite conclusion, {{that the average}} causal effect {{is an increase in}} <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> One obtains this result because the positive change in <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> for Joe <b>is</b> a larger percentage of his <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> This would occur if Joe's <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> lower than the <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> of the other subjects. For example, Joe's <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> 140 and increase by 14 mm Hg, an increase of 10%. If Mary's <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> 200 mm Hg and her <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> increases by 14 mm Hg, then her <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> only increases by 7%. Consequently, a small absolute change in <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> would yield a larger percentage change for Joe.|$|R
500|$|The team, led by Joseph Giordano, cut off Reagan's [...] "thousand dollar" [...] {{custom-made}} suit {{to examine}} him, much to Reagan's anger. Military officers, {{including the one}} who carried the nuclear football, unsuccessfully tried to prevent FBI agents from confiscating the suit, Reagan's wallet, and other possessions as evidence; the Gold Codes card was in the wallet, and the FBI did not return it until two days later. The medical personnel found that Reagan's systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> 60 versus the normal 140, indicating {{that he was in}} shock, and knew that most 70-year-olds in the president's condition would not survive. Reagan was in excellent physical health, however, and also was shot by the [...]22 caliber instead of the larger [...]38 as was first feared. They treated him with intravenous fluids, oxygen, tetanus toxoid, and chest tubes, and surprised Parr—who still believed that he had cracked the president's rib—by finding the entrance gunshot wound. Brady and the wounded agent McCarthy were operated on near the president; when his wife arrived in the emergency room, Reagan remarked to her, [...] "Honey, I forgot to duck", borrowing boxer Jack Dempsey's line to his wife the night he was beaten by Gene Tunney. While intubated, he scribbled to a nurse, [...] "All in all, I'd rather be in Philadelphia", borrowing W. C. Fields' line. Although Reagan came close to death, the team's quick action—and Parr's decision to drive to the hospital instead of the White House—likely saved the president's life, and within 30 minutes Reagan left the emergency room for surgery with normal blood pressure.|$|E
2500|$|During the drive, Joan {{told her}} mother she was going blind; her husband {{referred}} to this as a [...] "blackout". Upon arrival at Sharpstown General, Robinson Hill's <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> 60/40; the hospital nurse promptly took a second reading, as she believed {{that she had made}} some sort of error. After determining that the reading was correct, the nurse believed Joan was in shock and placed a call to Dr. Walter Bertinot, who was named as his wife's attending physician by John Hill. [...] Bertinot, who knew Joan only socially, had no reason to believe she was seriously ill until the call from the hospital nurse. [...] Hill had described his wife's symptoms as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; Bertinot initially thought she was suffering from influenza. When Bertinot arrived in Joan's hospital room, she recognized him and made reference to a party which they had both attended. [...] Bertinot ordered IV fluids, took another history, and now believed she had a case of foodborne illness.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{impossible}} to say without an examination," [...] the doctor answered. [...] "It looks like a stroke, but I'm pretty sure it isn't. It might be a coronary attack, but I happen to know his <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> normal, and his heart sound. He called in to see me only a week ago, and I examined him thoroughly. But sometimes you can be deceived. The inquest will tell us." [...] He eyed the body almost resentfully. [...] "I can't understand it. The man {{had no right to}} drop dead like this. He was a tough old sailor who ought to have been good for another twenty years. If you want my honest opinion--though I can't possibly be certain until after the inquest--I should say he had been poisoned." ...|$|E
5000|$|If the {{systolic}} <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> elevated (>140) with {{a normal}} (<90) diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (DBP), it <b>is</b> called [...] "isolated systolic hypertension".|$|R
40|$|Systemic {{arterial}} <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> {{flow and}} <b>blood</b> volume are closely regulated {{by a group}} of interrelated mechanisms. Perhaps the most important mechanism in the moment-to-moment control of arterial <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> the arterial baroreceptor reflex. This reflex influences <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> by modifying a series of cardiovascular parameters: heart rate, cardiac stroke volume and peripheral vascular resistance.

50|$|The <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> {{recorded}} as two readings: a high systolic pressure, which occurs during the maximal contraction of the heart, {{and the lower}} diastolic or resting <b>pressure.</b> A normal <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> would <b>be</b> 120 being the systolic over 80, the diastolic. Usually the <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> read from the left arm unless there is some damage to the arm. The difference between the systolic and diastolic <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> called the pulse pressure. The measurement of these <b>pressures</b> <b>is</b> now usually done with an aneroid or electronic sphygmomanometer. The classic measurement device is a mercury sphygmomanometer, using a column of mercury measured off in millimeters. In the United States and UK, the common form is millimeters of mercury, whilst elsewhere SI units of <b>pressure</b> <b>are</b> used. There is no natural 'normal' value for <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> but rather a range of values that on increasing are associated with increased risks. The guideline acceptable reading also takes into account other co-factors for disease. Therefore, elevated <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (hypertension) <b>is</b> variously defined when the systolic number is persistently over 140-160 mmHg. Low <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> hypotension. <b>Blood</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>are</b> also taken at other portions of the extremities. These <b>pressures</b> <b>are</b> called segmental <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> and <b>are</b> used to evaluate blockage or arterial occlusion in a limb (see Ankle brachial pressure index).|$|R
50|$|A device which {{recorded}} muscular activity accompanying {{changes in}} <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> developed in 1945 by John E. Reid, {{who claimed that}} greater accuracy could be obtained by making these recordings simultaneously with standard blood pressure-pulse-respiration recordings.|$|E
50|$|In a {{controlled}} trial of patients, it was noticed {{a decrease in}} mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure after the treatment with gallium nitrate. The decrease in <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> asymptomatic and did not require specific treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Modulating and ameliorating {{diabetic}} complications {{may improve}} {{the overall quality}} of life for diabetic patients. For example; when elevated <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> tightly controlled, diabetic related deaths were reduced by 32% compared to those with less controlled blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|Prehypertension, {{also known}} as high normal <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>is</b> an American medical {{classification}} for cases where a person's <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> elevated above normal, {{but not to the}} level considered hypertension (high <b>blood</b> <b>pressure).</b> Prehypertension <b>is</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> readings with a systolic pressure from 120 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic pressure from 80 to 89 mm Hg. Readings {{greater than or equal to}} 140/90 mm Hg are considered hypertension. Classification of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> based upon two or more readings at two or more separate occasions separated by at least one week. The seventh report of the Joint National Committee (JNC 7) proposed the new labeling for elevated <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> values below 140/90 to more accurately communicate the tendency of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> to rise with age.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{consistent}} and dramatic evidence of family influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) is family aggregation of physiological factors.
