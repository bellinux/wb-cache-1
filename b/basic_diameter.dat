The measure way including the construction for slope stabilization, vegetation engineering, slope drain, etc. Slope vegetation {{is conducive to}} the collapse of shallow landslide because the roots have functions in network soling and anchoring earth. We investigate the plants invaded and succession. We choose five of the most important dominant trees at landslide scars characteristics for its root strength to evaluate the model of slope stability. The regression analysis from the five plants shows the index correlation between peak pull-out force and <b>basic</b> <b>diameter.</b> We Integrated of all the regressions. The pulling resistance of Roxburgh sumac and Subcostate crape myrtle are stranger than others under fixed root diameter condition. We investigate the roots distribution to recover that Roxburgh sumac and Subcostate crape myrtle have a lot of root. The root is very deep and wide. So we can sure that Roxburgh sumac and Subcostate crape myrtle have larger effect on slope stability. In addition, we derived formula of root sheer stress. It shows that Taiwan hibiscus also have ability to stabilize earth because they have vertical roots deeply stretching into layer. In this study, {{as a result of the}} same <b>basic</b> <b>diameter</b> comparison, plant roots have some difference due to the actual age of the trees - drive-level curve, the growth of different soil characteristics and root extension. Sample size needs to be increased in experimental analysis, the actual collapse of the restoration and conservation of function with the slope remains to be further explored. 民國 88 年台灣中部地區 921 大地震，使石門水庫上游集水區地 質岩層受到嚴重之擾動及土石崩落；加上 93 年 8 月艾利颱風及 94 年 8 月馬莎颱風之豪雨，造成集水區內多處坡面崩塌，政府相關單位於 集水區內進行多處崩塌地之治理維護工作，其治理工作內容主要針對 崩塌區域進行坡面穩定工程、植生復育、坡面排水等。 坡地植生有利於淺層崩塌之抑止，根系之網結、固土與錨定等作 用。本研究於石門水庫集水區崩塌地，調查植生入侵與演替情形，依 植生調查結果，選取五種優勢鄉土樹種，針對其根力特性作探討，以 建立崩塌地優勢樹種根系特性及其對坡面安定功能之評估。 依五種供試植物之迴歸分析顯示，根系引拔抗力之最大值與基徑 呈指數相關，整合所有植物之迴歸式，在基徑(D) 條件固定下，山鹽 菁、九芎所需引拔抵抗力較大，觀察供試植物之根系分布狀態，九芎、山鹽菁根量多且深、根域面積廣，以此推測：九芎、山鹽菁之根系對邊坡穩定效果較大。另由本試驗推導出的土壤剪力強度增量公式，山芙蓉因具垂直根系、深入土層深部，也可增加土體的穩定性。 由於本研究係以崩塌地內相同徑級之根系力學進行比較，實際植 物根系因各樹種樹齡-徑級曲線，對不同土壤之生長與根系之伸展特 性均有所差異，以及取樣之樣本數系待加強試驗分析，實際對崩塌地 之復育與坡面保育功能仍待進一步探討。摘要	IV ABSTRACT	V 目錄	VII 圖目錄	IX 表目錄	XII 第一章 前 言	 1 第二章 文獻回顧	 2 2. 1 根系對土壤之影響機制	 2 2. 2 根系型態分類	 4 2. 3 植生根系對土壤加勁評價法	 7 2. 3. 1 土~根互制力學模式及邊坡穩定理論	 17 2. 3. 2 邊坡穩定量化評估	 18 第三章 研究方法	 21 3. 1 試區概述	 21 3. 2 研究方法	 22 3. 2. 1 研究流程	 22 3. 3 崩塌地植生調查	 24 3. 3. 1 植生調查計算	 24 3. 3. 2 植生調查結果	 25 3. 3. 3 供試植物材料	 25 3. 4 試驗項目與內容	 27 3. 4. 1 樣區土壤直剪試驗	 27 3. 4. 2 引拔抗力試驗	 28 3. 4. 3 引拔歷程分析	 31 3. 4. 4 根系型態調查	 32 3. 4. 5 根段拉力試驗	 32 3. 5 根力模式之統計迴歸分析	 33 3. 6 土壤剪力強度增量	 33 第四章 結果與討論	 37 4. 1 土壤剪力強度試驗	 37 4. 2 植株引拔抗力試驗	 38 4. 3 植株引拔歷程分析	 46 4. 4 植物根系型態與分佈調查	 53 4. 5 植株根段拉力	 66 4. 6 根系土壤剪力強度增量	 75 第五章 結論與建議	 77 5. 1 結論	 77 5. 2 建議	 78 參考文獻	 79 附錄一 石門水庫集水區崩塌地各樣區植物之重要值(%) 	 8...|$|E

In analysing the craniometric and cephalometric material we have used the morphotypological approach. We have used the classification of skull morpho-types proposed by V. V.

Co-variability of the <b>basic</b> <b>diameters</b> of human skulls on the Belarusian territory in the above-mentioned period has been taking place within the paraeuroid-mesoid (pm), i. e. mediumbroad medium dolichocephalic (long-headed) morphotype (10 – 13 th centuries, 18 – 19 th centuries and the early 21 st century) with transition to the euroid-mesoid (em), i. e. to broad medium dolichocep-halic (second half of 20 th century) аnd with the subsequent return to para-euroid-mesoid (mediumbroad medium dolichocephalic) morphotype in the early 21 st century.

The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{characterize}} the widthwise body diameters in children during the period 3 – 6 years of age {{on the base of}} data about six <b>basic</b> anthropometrical <b>diameters.</b> The data analyzed are for 6 <b>basic</b> body <b>diameters</b> as follows: biacromial, transversal and sagital chest diameters; bicristal, bispinal and bitrochanterial diameters in 440 children (210 boys and 130 girls) aged 3, 4, 5 and 6 years from kindergartens in Sofia town. During the period 3 - 6 years, the boys have bigger values for all investigated features with exception of bitrochanterial diameter, which in the 4 and 6 years old girls is bigger. The summarized increment of the diameters during the entire period is nearly equal in both sexes, slightly greater in girls. The growth velocity of the features is biggest during the age periods 3 - 4 and 5 - 6 years. Throughout the 4 -th and 5 -th year the growth velocity decreases with different degree for the separate diameters in both sexes, but more tangibly in girls.

40|$|Accounting of {{telecommunication}} services {{is closely related}} to the functions of authentication and authorization. These functions are usually considered together and implemented within the same server using a common protocol. The most renowned protocols for authentication, authorization and accounting are the RADIUS and Diameter protocols.   AAA functions and related protocols   In this chapter, the accounting management architecture developed by IETF is presented. It includes the interaction between network elements, accounting servers and billing and charging servers. Accounting data can be used for management, planning and charging users as well as other (specific) purposes. Authentication is the process of confirming a user's digital identity, usually through some type of identifiers and related data. Authorization determines whether a particular entity is authorized to perform an activity.   Basic Functions of the RADIUS Protocol   The RADIUS architecture is based on a client-server model. It uses UDP on the transport layer. Transactions between the client and the server are authenticated, which is achieved by using a common secret key that is never sent through the network. Given the limited resources available to network devices, RADIUS facilitates and centralizes charging end users, provides some protection against active attacks by unauthorized users and it has great support from different network equipment vendors. Although RADIUS is a widely accepted protocol for the mechanisms of authentication, authorization and accounting, it has certain shortcomings that may be caused by the protocol itself or by its poor implementation.   Architecture and Operation of the Diameter Protocol   Diameter is a scalable protocol designed by the IETF working group in order to eliminate shortcomings and functional limitations of the RADIUS protocol and eventually to replace it in the near future. Most of the <b>basic</b> <b>Diameter</b> mechanisms and its functionality are based on the fundamental functionality of the RADIUS protocol and the rest is a result of new solutions and improvements to the existing ideas. The Diameter protocol focuses on the expansion of flexible, advanced routing algorithms, dynamic troubleshooting and safety characteristics of the transport layer. This paper defines the basic packet formats, data transfer mechanisms and error management, methods of communication between individual elements of the architecture and basic security functions. The Diameter protocol architecture is based on the peer-to-peer model. Besides clients and servers, network agents can be the elements of this architecture. The Diameter agent is an element that does not allow authentication / authorization locally, but the server performs this operation, while one node can be both the client and the server simultaneously. The role of agents can be forwarding (Relay Agent), redirection (Redirect Agent), mediation (Proxy Agent) and translation (Translation Agent). Since the peer-to-peer model is applied, each Diameter element can establish more connections at the same time. Diameter enables the delivery of attribute value pairs, the possibility of negotiation, error notification, extensibility by adding new commands and attribute value pairs, the basic services necessary for applications such as managing user sessions or accounting.   Comparison of the RADIUS and Diameter protocols   Although at the protocol market for authentication, authorization and accounting, the RADIUS protocol remains the most popular, its popularity and dominance has a decreasing tendency. The main reasons for this are more prominent limitations which are particularly perceived due to new and increasingly popular technology. Therefore, the main issue is about a protocol that will replace RADIUS. The peer-to-peer architecture used by Diameter is much more flexible than the client-server model because in the peer-to-peer architecture every element can be both the client and the server, depending on the current needs of the network. At the transport layer, Diameter uses the TCP or SCTP protocols. When compared to UDP, these protocols provide reliable transmission which is very important for applications exchanging data related to accounting. In addition, the Diameter protocol allows the transmission of accounting information in real time and it incorporates several methods for troubleshooting in order to minimize the loss of accounting data when a failure occurs, which is not the case with RADIUS. Given the present benefits, introduced improvements, flexibility, expandability, IETF and 3 GPP's support and the support of big companies, there is a great chance that Diameter will replace RADIUS.   Conclusion   This paper presents a general overview of the RADIUS and Diameter protocols, including some of their basic operations with a special emphasis on accounting applications. The similarities of these protocols are reflected in the support of the same functions in a similar format of the packages. The differences are related to the protocol architectures and the methods of determining authentication, authorization and accounting mechanisms. Regarding accounting aspects, the most important advantages of the Diameter protocol are its possibility to transmit accounting information in real time and implemented mechanisms for troubleshooting in order to minimize the loss of accounting data in case of failure. Owing to to these characteristics, the Diameter protocol achieves a significant advantage over RADIUS in next generation networks. </p...|$|E

40|$|Summary We {{tested the}} effects of growth {{characteristics}} and basic density on hydraulic and mechanical properties of mature Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) wood from six 24 -year-old clones, grown on two sites in southern Sweden dif-fering in water availability. Hydraulic parameters assessed were specific hydraulic conductivity at full saturation (ks 100) and vulnerability to cavitation (Ψ 50), mechanical parameters included bending strength (σb), modulus of elasticity (MOE), compression strength (σa) and Young’s modulus (E). <b>Basic</b> density, <b>diameter</b> at breast height, tree height, and hydraulic and mechanical parameters varied considerably among clones. Clonal means of hydraulic and mechanical properties were strongly related to basic density and to growth parameters across sites, especially to diameter at breast height. Compared with stem wood of slower growing clones, stem wood of rap-idly growing clones had significantly lower basic density, lower σb, MOE, σa and E, was more vulnerable to cavitation, but had higher ks 100. Basic density was negatively correlated to Ψ 50 and ks 100. We therefore found a tradeoff between Ψ 50 and ks 100. Clones with high basic density had significantly lower hy-draulic vulnerability, but also lower hydraulic conductivity at full saturation and thus less rapid growth than clones with low basic density. This tradeoff involved a negative relationship be-tween Ψ 50 and σb as well as MOE, and between ks 100 and σb, MOE andσa. Basic density andΨ 50 showed no site-specific dif-ferences, but tree height, diameter at breast height, ks 100 and mechanical strength and stiffness were significantly lower at the drier site. Basic density had no influence on the site-de-pendent differences in hydraulic and mechanical properties, but was strongly negatively related to diameter at breast height. Selecting for growth may thus lead not only {{to a reduction in}} mechanical strength and stiffness but also to a reduction in hy-draulic safety...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies in}} Eucalyptus nitens have {{revealed}} favourable genetic correlations exist between acoustic wave velocity (AWV) in standing trees and {{modulus of elasticity}} (MOE), which can determine the suitability of trees for structural timber and/or engineered wood products. This study investigates the strength and stability of genetic variation in standing tree AWV {{across a range of}} environments in Tasmania, where {{there are a number of}} large plantation estates and breeding trials. Trees under study were from open-pollinated progeny trials established in 1993. Across sites, for standing tree AWV the ranking of E. nitens races did not change and within-race additive genetic correlations were strong (0. 61 to 0. 99). Heritabilities (0. 16 to 0. 74) and coefficients of additive genetic variation (2. 6 to 4. 8) were moderate for this trait. Correlations between standing tree AWV and both <b>basic</b> density and <b>diameter</b> at breast height (DBH) were favourable. Results indicate that there is potential to improve MOE in E. nitens through the exploitation of genetic variation in AWV among and within races, the expression of genetic variation in AWV is relatively stable across different growing environments, and past selection for basic density and growth in pulpwood breeding programs is unlikely to have adversely affected MOE...|$|R

40|$|Now {{that there}} is a need to {{increase}} a processing capacity, curved cutting edge mills find ever-growing use. Also known as “rough end”, “full-side”, and “heavy-duty” mills, they provide the increased depth and width values of milling owing to the width-sized chip separation. The analysis of produced mills allowed us both to reveal their basic design components (type of a shaft or <b>basic</b> opening, <b>diameter</b> and length of the cutting part, mill length, quantity of teeth, a tilt angle of a screw flute) and to make their classification. The paper presents a classification of the profile types of cutting edges, which can be divided by form (flat, round), size (small, large, super-large), and symmetry (symmetrical and asymmetrical). The profile of the cutting edge is characterized by the following parameters: profile height, pitch of crests spherical radius of crest. A review of the curved cutting edge profile types allows us to build the geometrical constructions to define a form and the sizes of the chip load made by the cutting edge from a billet. It is shown that parameters of the cutting edge profile influence the form and the sizes (thickness and width) of the chip load. The chip load thickness provided by the curved cutting edge mills exceeds that of observed when using the “smooth” cutting edge mills. A thickening degree of the chip load is changed with changing form and sizes of the cutting edge mill profile. Larger thickening is observed if the chip load is limited from below and from above by the marks of a single tooth (the first or second etc.), and a length of the other teeth marks is minimum. The most achievable chip load thickness is equal to feed per revolution. Studying the references allowed us to formulate some rules to choose a cutting edge profile depending on a type of the processed material and a desirable roughness of the processed surface. It is important to note the following. When choosing a profile of the cutting edge it is possible to be guided by the rule: as a hardness of the processed material increases and a desirable roughness of the processed surface decreases it is necessary to use mills with a profile of the smaller height and pitch. </p...|$|R

Gellan xanthan gels along with chitosan nanoparticles of 297 &plusmn; 61 nm <b>diameter,</b> <b>basic</b> fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP 7) were employed in a dual growth factor delivery system to promote the differentiation of human fetal osteoblasts. An injectable system with ionic and temperature gelation was optimized and characterized. The nanoparticle loaded gels showed significantly improved cell proliferation and differentiation due to the sustained release of growth factors. A differentiation marker study was conducted, analyzed, and compared to understand the effect of single vs dual growth factors and free vs encapsulated growth factors. Dual growth factor loaded gels showed a higher alkaline phosphatase and calcium deposition compared to single growth factor loaded gels. The results suggest that encapsulation and stabilization of growth factors within nanoparticles and gels are promising for bone regeneration. Gellan xanthan gels also showed antibacterial effects against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, the common pathogens in implant failure.

40|$|Aim of {{the study}} : The {{aim of this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of xylem tissue cell structure, determined through biometry and basic density of the wood from Corymbia citriodora Hill & Johnson on consumption of specific 90 º- 0 º longitudinal cutting force. Area of study : The study area was in the region of the Vale do Rio Doce - Minas Gerais, Brazil. Material and methods : A diametrical board with dimensions of 60 x 18 x 5 cm (length x width x thickness, respectively), with more than 1. 3 m from the ground, was removed. In machining trials, a 400 mm diameter circular saw was used, with 24 “WZ” teeth, feed rate of 10 m. min - 1, cutting speed of 61 m. s - 1, and maximum instantaneous torque of 92. 5 N. m. During cutting, test specimens were removed with alternated and parallel 1. 5 cm edges in 6 radial positions, which were used for biometric determination of cell structure and basic density. Main results : It was observed that wood <b>basic</b> density, vessel <b>diameter,</b> fiber wall thickness, fiber wall fraction and fiber wall portion were directly proportional to the specific cutting force. In contrast, vessel frequency and fiber lumen diameter proved to be inversely proportional to cutting force. Research highlights : This work provides important values of quantification of influence of xylem tissue cell structure, determined through biometry and physical properties of the wood that may be used to prediction of consumption of specific cutting force.

40|$|Near {{infrared}} reflectance {{analysis was used}} to predict kraft pulp yield of open-pollinated progenies from 70 families collected from six populations (subraces) across the natural distribution of E. globulus: West Otways, Strzelecki Ranges, Furneaux Islands, King Island, north east Tasmania and south east Tasmania. Three sites were sampled and all sample trees were also assessed for <b>diameter</b> and wood <b>basic</b> density. Genetic parameters for predicted pulp yield, pulpwood productivity (basic density multiplied by predicted pulp yield) and pulp production index (pulpwood productivity multiplied by tree diameter) were estimated together with the degree and practical importance of genotype by environment interactions for each trait Predicted pulp yield was under moderate genetic control (h 2 ranging from 0. 33 to 0. 58), pulpwood productivity was under strong genetic control (h 2 ranging from 0. 33 to 0. 58) and pulp production index generally under weak genetic control (h 2 ranging from 0. 80 to 0. 84). Genetic correlations between diameter and predicted pulp yield were variable (ranging from - 0. 16 to - 0. 43) as were genetic correlations between basic density and predicted pulp yield (range 0. 00 to 0. 74). Genotype by environment interaction was not considered a major problem for predicted pulp yield and pulpwood productivity. Although significant interaction between the subraces and sites was found for predicted pulp yield {{there were no significant differences}} among subraces at one site and the range of subrace means was small. For predicted pulp yield the family by site interaction was not significant, genetic correlations between the sites were very high and the heritability estimated for the combined data set was similar to the average of the individual site estimates. Combining tree <b>diameter,</b> <b>basic</b> density and predicted pulp yield data into a single variable (pulp production index) is not recommended as the heritability was generally low and it was subject to significant genotype by environment interaction...|$|R
40|$|Genetic parameters, {{including}} heritabilities, trait-trait correlations, across-site and acrossgeneration correlations, in four Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata clonal {{trials in}} northern New South Wales, Australia and four Eucalyptus urophylla open-pollinated progeny trials (two first generation and two second generation trials) in Guangxi, China were estimated. The additive and non-additive variances were calculated {{separately from the}} total genetic variances in C. citriodora subsp. variegata clonal trials to allow the estimation of broad- and narrow- sense heritabilities. Efficient selection strategies using selection indices are also presented in discussion section. For C. citriodora subsp. variegata clonal trials, Quambalaria shoot blight damage at the ages of 1. 0 - 1. 7 years and 3. 5 - 3. 8 years was under predominantly non-additive genetic control (H 2 = 0. 02 - 0. 46, h 2 = 0 - 0. 17). Growth traits were, overall, under moderate genetic control (H 2 = 0. 32 - 0. 54, h 2 = 0 - 0. 54). For tree height, nearly 100 % of the genetic variances were contributed by the non-additive component. For diameter at breast height and individual tree volume, the dominant genetic variances were non-additive (66 - 80 %) at the Coffs Harbour and Grafton sites, whilst the additive variances (88 - 100 %) became dominant at the other two sites. Bark thickness and percentage (H 2 = 0. 45 - 0. 81) and non-destructive wood properties (H 2 = 0. 57 - 0. 87) were under moderate to high genetic control, with 45 - 100 % of the genetic variances being additive for bark traits and basic density and 76 - 100 % of the genetic variances being non-additive for acoustic stiffness (represented by acoustic velocity squared). Growth traits were strongly correlated with Quambalaria damage, especially for the second assessment (rg = 0. 53 - 0. 85). Correlations between growth and bark traits showed that larger trees tended to have thicker bark (rg = 0. 50 - 0. 79), but did not necessarily have higher bark proportion (rg = - 0. 48 to 0. 26). There was no significant relationship between growth traits and wood properties (Pilodyn penetration, basic density or acoustic velocity squared), but strongly negative correlations between Pilodyn penetration and acoustic velocity squared (rg = - 0. 76 to - 0. 53). Basic density and Pilodyn penetration were highly negatively correlated (rg = - 0. 95 to - 1. 00). Low across-site correlations for Quambalaria damage (rg = 0. 13 - 1. 00) were observed, indicating genotype by environment interactions (GEIs) occurred. Across-site correlations for growth traits were reasonably high, with most estimates above 0. 8. Relatively lower correlations (under 0. 7), however, were also found between some pairs of sites. These lower correlations for growth traits were {{probably due to the}} disease effects or due to some degree of GEL By contrast, across-site correlations for wood properties (rg = 0. 84 - 0. 99) and bark traits (rg = 0. 83 - 0. 96) were notably high, especially those for basic density, indicating no significant GEI. For E. urophylla progeny trials, growth traits (h 2 = 0. 05 - 0. 39) were under low to moderate additive genetic control, whereas bark traits (h 2 = 0. 22 - 0. 38) and wood properties (h 2 = 0. 35 - 0. 66) were under moderate to strong additive genetic control. Narrow-sense heritabilities for growth traits and basic density appeared to decrease over generations. The larger trees tended to have thicker bark (rg = 0. 48 to 0. 57) but did not necessarily have higher bark percentage (rg = - 0. 40 to 0. 32). Correlations between growth traits and <b>basic</b> density (say <b>diameter</b> at breast height and Pilodyn penetration) were favourable strong in the first generation (rg = 0. 26 and 0. 48) but were not significantly different from zero in the second generation (rg = - 0. 06 and 0. 20). There was strong negative correlation (rg = - 1. 00) between basic density and Pilodyn penetration. Acoustic velocity squared was highly positively correlated with basic density (rg = 0. 63) (except Pilodyn penetration, rg = - 0. 04) and growth traits (rg = 0. 49 - 0. 63). Across-site correlation for diameter at breast height within the inland Dongmen region (rg = 0. 81) indicated that there was no GEI. However, GEIs for growth traits were significant between Dongmen and Shankou (rg = 0. 37 - 0. 79). No GEI for basic density was present either within the Dongmen region (rg = 1. 00) or between Dongmen and Shankou (rg = 0. 99). Traits with higher heritabilities (e. g. wood property traits) in the first generation had higher across-generation correlations (rg = 0. 63 - 1. 00). On the contrary, traits with lower heritabilities (e. g. growth traits) had lower across-generation correlations (rg = - 0. 26 to 0. 83). The estimates of across-generation correlations between Dongmen and Shankou obtained in this study were somewhat lower, indicating some degree of GEI...|$|R
