40|$|This study {{examines}} forest use in post-socialist Albania. The {{aim was to}} investigate the use of high-stem <b>forests,</b> coppice <b>forests,</b> <b>broadleaved</b> <b>forests</b> and coniferous forests for resource and biodiversity in commune forests. Data of presences and absences of high-stem <b>forests,</b> coppice <b>forests,</b> <b>broadleaved</b> <b>forests</b> and coniferous forests were measured from forest surveys of management plans. These data were integrated with environmental, socioeconomic and policy data using generalized linear models and spatial scale. Policy models had ten neighborhood variables of the density of roads and the density of human settlements from one km to five km with a priory assumption that the extent of these variables influenced the use of forests in post-socialist Albania. The final policy model of commune forests included accessibility variables and had a prediction accuracy of 99 percent at radii of 2 km for high-stem forests and 1 km for coppice <b>forests</b> and <b>broadleaved</b> <b>forests.</b> It is recommended the implementation of a policy to use sustainably all forests in Albania...|$|R

50|$|The {{ruby-throated hummingbird}} is migratory, {{spending}} most of the winter in southern Mexico and Central America, {{as far south as}} extreme western Panama, the West Indies, and southern Florida. During migration, some birds embark on a nonstop 900-mile journey across the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean from Panama to Gulf Coast. The bird breeds throughout the eastern United States, east of the 100th meridian, and in southern Canada, particularly Ontario, in eastern and mixed deciduous and <b>broadleaved</b> <b>forest.</b> In winter, it is seen mostly in Mexico and southern Florida.|$|E
50|$|Rainfall varies between 500 and 1200 mm and {{is equally}} {{distributed}} during the year, with maximums during autumn and spring.Winds are usually weak, although sudden bursts of foehn or thunderstorms can sweep the air clean. The almost enclosed {{nature of the}} Padan basin, indeed, added to the crushing weight of road traffic, makes it prone to {{a high level of}} pollution in winter, when cold air clings to the soil. The natural potential vegetation of the Po basin is a mixed <b>broadleaved</b> <b>forest</b> of Quercus robur, Populus ssp., Carpinus betulus, Alnus ssp., Sambucus nigra, Ulmus ssp., Salix ssp., Acer ssp., Fraxinus ssp. and other central-European trees.|$|E
50|$|One of Tompkins' central {{commitments}} is {{to preserving}} biodiversity; the Pumalín conservation area not only provides visitors a spectacular wilderness experience, but also protects the area's threatened ecosystem and species. Although Chile lacks the faunal diversity of Amazon-area countries, it {{is rich in}} flora, with many endemic species and subspecies. The evergreen <b>broadleaved</b> <b>forest,</b> known in Chile as the Valdivian temperate rainforest, includes thousands of plant species. The annual rainfall in the coastal forests of Pumalín Park is approximately 6000 mm. These exceptionally wet, original forests reach {{all the way to}} the ocean, something that is increasingly rare worldwide. In addition, the park protects some of the last remaining stands of Alerce trees, one of the oldest species on Earth.|$|E

40|$|As {{two major}} forest {{types in the}} subtropics, broadleaved {{evergreen}} and <b>broadleaved</b> deciduous <b>forests</b> have long interested ecologists. However, {{little is known about}} their belowground ecosystems despite their ecological importance in driving biogeochemical cycling. Here, we used Illumina MiSeq sequencing targeting 16 S rRNA gene and a microarray named GeoChip targeting functional genes to analyse microbial communities in broadleaved evergreen and deciduous forest soils of Shennongjia Mountain of Central China, a region known as The Oriental Botanic Garden' for its extraordinarily rich biodiversity. We observed higher plant diversity and relatively richer nutrients in the <b>broadleaved</b> evergreen <b>forest</b> than the deciduous forest. In odds to our expectation that plant communities shaped soil microbial communities, we found that soil organic matter quantity and quality, but not plant community parameters, were the best predictors of microbial communities. Actinobacteria, a copiotrophic phylum, was more abundant in the <b>broadleaved</b> evergreen <b>forest,</b> while Verrucomicrobia, an oligotrophic phylum, was more abundant in the <b>broadleaved</b> deciduous <b>forest.</b> The density of the correlation network of microbial OTUs was higher in the <b>broadleaved</b> deciduous <b>forest</b> but its modularity was smaller, reflecting lower resistance to environment changes. In addition, keystone OTUs of the <b>broadleaved</b> deciduous <b>forest</b> were mainly oligotrophic. Microbial functional genes associated with recalcitrant carbon degradation were also more abundant in the <b>broadleaved</b> deciduous <b>forests,</b> resulting in low accumulation of organic matters. Collectively, these findings revealed the important role of soil organic matter in shaping microbial taxonomic and functional traits...|$|R
50|$|The oblast's forest zone has two subzones: {{combined}} coniferous and <b>broadleaved,</b> and <b>broadleaved</b> <b>forests.</b> The combined subzone {{is dominated}} by various types of spruce forests. The tree layer in such forests is formed by the Norway spruce mixed with pine, birch, aspen, basswood and common oak. Primary <b>broadleaved</b> <b>forests</b> occupy a small area in the interfluve between the Vytebet, the Zhizdra and the Oka. Here, the edificatory species are common oak, tillet, taller ash, and elm trees. Unlike the coniferous forests, these are polydominant ones, with 7 to 8 layers. Usually there is birch and aspen in the second layer, with lowland maple, crab apple and field-ash in the third layer. There is also a well-developed layer of shrub. Herbage {{is dominated by}} prevernal ephemeroids and perennials.|$|R
5000|$|The natural {{vegetation}} of Melamchi Valley ranges from tropical zone to the Alpine pastures towards {{the north of}} Jugal Himal.

50|$|The Krumovitsa {{banks are}} often steep, covered with low rocks. Its valley is {{occupied}} by farmland patches. The Djushun Dere river valley is mostly narrow and cuts deeply in volcanic rocks with very steep cliffs along the riverbed, waterfalls and small caves. The vegetation along its banks is scarce and dominated by shrub species. Both rivers have a strongly fluctuating water level - very high in February-March and almost none in July-August (except in isolated pools). Most of the area includes low-mountain ridges and slopes. Its bigger part is treeless but the most south-eastern regions are covered by old <b>broadleaved</b> <b>forest</b> of Quercus frainetto, Quercus dalechampii, at places mixed with Carpinus orientalis. Secondary forests have replaced the old ones that have been cut in the recent decades. Typical for the slopes and ridges of the two valleys are the numerous rocks, rock complexes and crests, along with the extensive areas covered by shrub formations of Mediterranean type, dominated by Juniperus oxycedrus, etc. There are many stony sections, overgrown with grass vegetation.|$|E
5000|$|Masuria and the Masurian Lake District {{are known}} in Polish as Kraina Tysiąca Jezior and in German as Land der Tausend Seen, meaning [...] "land of a {{thousand}} lakes." [...] These lakes were ground out of the land by glaciers during the Pleistocene ice age around 14,000 - 15,000 years ago, when ice covered northeastern Europe. From that period originates the horn of a reindeer found {{in the vicinity of}} Giżycko. [...] By 10,000 BC this ice started to melt. Great geological changes took place and even in the last 500 years the maps showing the lagoons and peninsulas on the Baltic Sea have greatly altered in appearance. More than in other parts of northern Poland, such as from Pomerania (from the River Oder to the River Vistula), this continuous stretch of lakes is popular among tourists. The terrain is rather hilly, with connecting lakes, rivers and streams. Forests account for about 30% of the area. The northern part of Masuria is covered mostly by the <b>broadleaved</b> <b>forest,</b> while the southern part is dominated by pine and mixed forests.|$|E
