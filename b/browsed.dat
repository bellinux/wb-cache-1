5|$|Thescelosaurus {{would have}} <b>browsed</b> {{in the first}} meter or so from the ground, feeding selectively, with food held in the mouth by cheeks while chewing. Thescelosaurus was {{probably}} slower than other hypsilophodonts, because of its heavier build and leg structure. Compared to them, it had unusual hindlimbs, because the upper leg was longer than the shin, the opposite of Hypsilophodon and running animals in general. One specimen {{is known to have}} had a bone pathology, with the long bones of the right foot fused at their tops, hindering swift movement.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinct}} {{shape of}} the skull shows that Deinocheirus had a more specialised diet than other ornithomimosaurs. The beak {{was similar to that}} of ducks, which indicates it may have likewise foraged in water, or <b>browsed</b> near the ground like some sauropods and hadrosaurs. The attachment sites for the muscles that open and close the jaws were very small in comparison {{to the size of the}} skull, which indicates Deinocheirus had a weak bite force. The skull was likely adapted for cropping soft understorey or water vegetation. The depth of the lower jaw indicates the presence of a large tongue, which could have assisted the animal in sucking in food material obtained with the broad beak when foraging on the bottom of freshwater bodies.|$|E

However, most of these works focus on mining <b>browsing</b> patterns of web pages directly. In this work, we introduce the problem of mining <b>browsing</b> patterns on cross-levels of a taxonomy comprised of web pages. In addition, <b>browsing</b> time is considered and processed using fuzzy set concepts to form linguistic terms. The proposed algorithm thus discovers cross-level relevant <b>browsing</b> behavior from linguistic data and promotes the discovery of coarsen granularity of web <b>browsing</b> patterns...|$|R

5|$|Nigersaurus was {{suggested}} by Sereno and colleagues to be a ground-level, non-selective browser. The {{width of the}} muzzle and lateral orientation of the tooth row show that the sauropod could gather much food and crop it close to the ground, within one metre of the surface. This is further supported by facets on the labial (externally facing) side of the upper teeth, similar to Dicraeosaurus and Diplodocus, which are evidence that food or substrate wore the animal's teeth as it fed. Nigersaurus also bears signs of low-angle tooth-to-tooth wear {{on the inside of}} the maxillary crowns, which suggests that jaw movement was limited to precise up-and-down motions. Worn teeth from the lower jaw have not yet been discovered, but they are expected to show opposing tooth-to-tooth wear. The ability to raise their heads well above the ground does not necessarily mean they <b>browsed</b> on items there, and the short neck of Nigersaurus would have restricted the browsing range compared to other diplodocoids.|$|E
5|$|Sauropelta {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} known nodosaurids. All specimens of S. edwardsorum were recovered from the Little Sheep Mudstone section of the Cloverly Formation in Wyoming and Montana, which has been dated to 108.5 million years ago, during the Early Cretaceous. Sauropelta lived in wide floodplains around rivers that drained into the shallow inland sea to the north and east, carrying sediment eroded from the low mountains to the west. Periodic flooding of these rivers covered the surrounding plains with new muddy sediments, creating the Cloverly Formation and burying the remains of many animals, some of which would be fossilized. At the end of Cloverly times, the shallow sea would expand to cover the entire region and would eventually split North America completely in half, forming the Western Interior Seaway. Abundant fossil remains of coniferous trees suggest that these plains were covered in forests. Grasses would not evolve until later in the Cretaceous, so Sauropelta and other Early Cretaceous dinosaurian herbivores <b>browsed</b> from a variety of conifers and cycads. Nodosaurids like Sauropelta had narrow snouts, an adaptation seen today in animals that are selective browsers as opposed to the wide muzzles of grazers.|$|E

40|$|Poster session {{presented}} at the 2007 Washington State University Academic Showcase, March 23, 2007. <b>Browsing,</b> in information context, can be defined in many ways including general, general purposive and specific (Apted 1971). It is â an activity which provokes new thought by exposing the user {{to a wide variety}} of stimuli, but without being planned to do soâ (Apted 1971). This includes an iterative movement in scanning and examining sources (Twidale et al. 1994) which will generate serendipitous findings and creative ideas. <b>Browsing</b> has been used by scholars in all disciplines including social <b>browsing,</b> database <b>browsing,</b> index <b>browsing,</b> bibliography <b>browsing,</b> table-of-content <b>browsing,</b> catalog <b>browsing,</b> and stack <b>browsing.</b> In library and information science literature, attention has been lacking in research on how to facilitate <b>browsing</b> through the improvement of library catalogs and how to teach <b>browsing</b> as a research and information seeking method through library instruction. Where focus has been placed on keyword searching and truncation, lessons on how to <b>browse</b> various resources and use the catalog to its fullest extent might prove more beneficial. As academic campuses focus more and more on the quality of education, it is important to raise awareness of <b>browsing</b> as a useful research method.

5000|$|As {{with any}} kind of human {{psychology}} is <b>browsing</b> understood in biological, behavioral or cognitive terms on the one hand or in social, historical and cultural terms on the other hand. Marcia Bates (2007) researched <b>browsing</b> from [...] "behavioural" [...] approaches, while Hjørland (2011a+b) defended a social view. Bates found that <b>browsing</b> is rooted in our history as exploratory, motile animals hunting for food and nesting opportunities. According to Hjørland (2011a), on the other hand, Marcia Bates' <b>browsing</b> for information about <b>browsing</b> is governed by her behavioral assumptions, while Hjørland's <b>browsing</b> for information about <b>browsing</b> is governed by his socio-cultural understanding of human psychology.

25|$|Pollards cut at {{only about}} a metre or so above the ground are called stubs (or stubbs). These were often used as markers in coppice or other woodland. Stubs cannot be used where the trees are <b>browsed</b> by animals, as the regrowing shoots are below the browse line.|$|E
25|$|As sauropods, dicraeosaurids are obligate herbivores. Due {{to their}} {{relatively}} small necks and skull shape, {{it has been}} deducted that dicraeosaurids and diplodocids primarily <b>browsed</b> {{close to the ground}} or at mid height. Among the dicraeosurids, only Dicraeosaurus has well-preserved dentition. This makes it difficult for paleontologists to make definitive statements about Dicraeosauridae feeding behavior compared to diplodocid feeding behavior. However, compared to its known relatives, Dicraeosaurus is unique in that it has an equal number of teeth in the upper and lower jaw, though teeth in the lower jaw are replaced more slowly.|$|E

25|$|The {{importance}} of sagebrush {{in the diet}} of adult greater sage-grouse is great; numerous studies have documented its year-round use. A Montana study, based on 299 crop samples, showed that 62% of total food volume {{of the year was}} sagebrush. Between December and February, it was the only food item found in all crops. Only between June and September did sagebrush constitute less than 60% of their diet. Sage grouse select sagebrush species differentially. Greater sage-grouse in Antelope Valley, California, <b>browsed</b> black sagebrush more frequently than the more common big sagebrush. The browse of black sagebrush is highly preferred by greater sage-grouse in Nevada. In southeastern Idaho, black sagebrush was preferred as forage.|$|E
25|$|Eohippus {{appeared}} in the Ypresian (early Eocene), about 52 mya (million years ago).

It had 44 low-crowned teeth, in the typical arrangement of an omnivorous, browsing mammal: three incisors, one canine, four premolars, and three molars {{on each side of the}} jaw. Its molars were uneven, dull, and bumpy, and used primarily for grinding foliage. The cusps of the molars were slightly connected in low crests. Eohippus <b>browsed</b> on soft foliage and fruit, probably scampering between thickets in the mode of a modern muntjac. It had a small brain, and possessed especially small frontal lobes.|$|E

25|$|Grant’s gazelles are {{generally}} mixed feeders that both browse and graze. Their average diet consists of 65.8% browse and 34.3% graze. Rainfall in their habitats {{seems to be}} the determinant of their diets. The Grant's gazelle's diet may also be responsible for the slow growth rates in the <b>browsed</b> plots. They get most of their moisture from the plants they eat, so they do not often have to drink water. Thus they can stay on the plains long after the rains end. From July to September, gazelles move deep into dense brush and wait for the next rains. They will eat red oats and small, tough plants, which are avoided by the other ungulates. This allows the gazelles to survive in the brush during the dry season. Grant’s gazelles eat mainly dicotyledons during the dry season and grass in the wet season.|$|E
25|$|The {{range of}} most species of Mammut is unknown as their occurrences are {{restricted}} to few localities, the exception being the American mastodon (M.americanum), {{which is one of}} the most widely distributed Pleistocene proboscideans in North America. M.americanum fossil sites range in time from the faunal stages of Blancan to Rancholabrean and in locations from as far north as Alaska, as far east as Florida, and as far south as the state of Puebla in central Mexico, with an isolated record from Honduras, probably reflecting the results of the maximum expansion achieved by the American mastodon during the Late Pleistocene. A few isolated reports tell of mastodons being found along the east coast up to the New England region, with high concentrations in the Mid-Atlantic region. There is strong evidence indicating that the members of Mammut were forest dwelling proboscideans, predominating in woodlands and forests, and <b>browsed</b> on trees and shrubs. They apparently did not disperse southward to South America, it being speculated that this was because of a dietary specialization on a particular type of vegetation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Browsing</b> large image {{collections}} is {{a complex}} and often tedious task, due to the semantic gap existing between the user subjective notion of similarity and the one according to which a <b>browsing</b> system organizes the images.

A key feature of PIBE is that it maintains local similarity criteria for each portion of the <b>Browsing</b> Tree.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of <b>browsing</b> on skunkbush (Rhus trilobata) and chokecherry (Prunus virginiana) following two wildfires in the Missouri Breaks region of Garfield County in east-central Montana, one fire in the 2003 the other in 2006. Study objectives included: 1) Determine the potential height to which skunkbush and chokecherry can grow under local conditions, and 2) Determine if <b>browsing</b> will prevent young plants from attaining that potential height. Because ungulates are attracted to recently burned areas {{it is important to}} monitor <b>browse</b> use and regulate <b>browsing</b> pressure to a benign level. We documented the effect of <b>browsing</b> by measurement of plant height and age, <b>browsing</b> level, and LD Index. The most rapid growth occurred {{in the first two years}} following the fires. It is predicted that <b>browsing</b> will not prevent skunkbush from growing to its potential height. Three lines of evidence indicate that <b>browsing</b> is likely to prevent many chokecherry plants from growing to potential height. In the first few years following wildfire, the potential effect of <b>browsing</b> is best documented by analysis of height and age relationships and by analysis of stem growth rate.
