5|$|On 17 September 1909, Kaiser Barbarossa was {{decommissioned}} {{and assigned}} to the Reserve Division in the Baltic Sea. By that time, the new dreadnought battleships, which rendered Kaiser Barbarossa and her sister ships thoroughly obsolete, were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> into service with the fleet. In early 1910, Kaiser Barbarossa was {{assigned to the}} Training Squadron, which operated in the Baltic in April. She was reactivated to participate in the autumn maneuvers that year in the provisional III Squadron; after the conclusion of the exercises on 10 September, she was placed back in reserve. More modernization work was done at the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel. From 31 July to 15 September, she was reactivated again {{to take part in the}} autumn maneuvers in the III Squadron. She thereafter returned to the Reserve Division in early 1912.|$|E
5|$|With {{the opening}} of the New York – Pennsylvania Joint Bridge Commission, a {{predecessor}} of the current Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, in the 1920s to buy out these bridges from private ownership, the tolls along the bridges of the Delaware were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to an end. The Commission offered the Bridge Company an offer of $19,542.22 (1920s USD). The company took the offer and under new ownership, the tolls were eliminated. The bridge had more activity after the elimination of tolls and business continued to prosper. With the new owners, the bridge was kept under routine maintenance, and the bridge has continued to maintain a strong structure. Even with the floods from Hurricanes Connie and Diane of 1955 and the 1960s, the bridge survived with little to no structural damage. From May to October 1986, the commission closed the bridge to do some renovations. The wooden deck was replaced, the entire bridge was painted, and new guide rails were constructed. The only thing is that the 3 ton (6000lb) weight limit remained after the revamping. On November 14, 1988, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

25|$|The two mounted {{divisions}} {{were now}} in position, watching for the expected Ottoman reinforcements. By between 11:00 and 11:35, {{more or less}} all mounted troops were under fire. This fire came from shells launched from Gaza, or from German or Ottoman planes flying over Beit Durdis, {{as well as a}} long range gun, while another gun also fired on the mounted units. The battery of the 5th Mounted Brigade fired on some small groups of Ottoman infantry, but the hostile long range gun accurately returned fire, causing this battery to change position. Very little fighting had yet taken place, so far as the mounted units were concerned, and the infantry attack had not made much progress. However, news was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in from the overwatching Desert Column patrols, reporting movements from the direction of Huj and the Beersheba railway line, and columns of dust in the direction of Tel esh Sharia, all indicating large scale Ottoman Army movements in progress. However, by 12:00 Chetwode commanding Desert Column, had not yet received any reports of Ottoman reinforcements moving towards Gaza, and he sent a message to Chauvel commanding the Anzac Mounted Division and Hodgson commanding the Imperial Mounted Division, to prepare to send a brigade each to assist the infantry attack on Gaza.|$|E

500|$|Before Devers' arrival, Armored Force {{doctrine}} emphasized light tanks weighing no {{more than}} [...] American doctrine held that tanks were for exploitation, not fighting other tanks. He rejected the M6 heavy tank and recommended to McNair that it be cancelled, citing its tremendous weight and concerns about its mobility and reliability. This was seen as support for this position, but Devers wanted a medium tank, preferably mounting something like a 105mm howitzer. He was appalled {{to find that the}} Armored Force's tanks were armed with nothing heavier than a 37mm gun. A new medium tank was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> off the production line: the M3 Lee. Devers observed testing of one just days after taking command, and was unimpressed. American industry was unable to cast a turret large enough to hold a 75mm gun, so the M3 carried a 37mm gun, with a 75mm in a sponson. This gave it a limited traverse, rendering it difficult to engage moving targets. To make matters worse, the designers shortened the barrel to improve the M3's mobility, which Devers realized also reduced the gun's muzzle velocity, and hence its effectiveness against armor. In practice, M3 crews attempted to engage German armor with the 75mm, as the 37mm was ineffective against it. It was found that the 75mm could penetrate the frontal armor of German tanks at , but German tanks destroyed M3s at up to [...] Devers pronounced the M3 [...] "overweight, underpowered, and insufficiently armed".|$|E

2500|$|Several {{international}} shipping companies have also previously {{been implicated in}} the export of illegally harvested wood from Madagascar, although most of them immediately and unequivocally ceased such operations when confronted with the issue. Between January and April 2009, United Africa Feeder Line (UAFL), based in Mauritius, shipped 80% of the exports out of Vohémar and Delmas Shipping, based in France and a subsidiary of CMA CGM, shipped the remaining 20%. According to local sources, Spanfreight and Safmarine Container Lines N.V. have also {{been involved in the}} exports, although the EIA and Global Witness report could not substantiate the claim at the time. Other companies, such as Pacific International Lines (PIL), may also be involved or may become involved, {{but it is difficult to}} track since containers are transshipped, and effectively laundered, through nearby Réunion or Mauritius.

Barton is given six-months notice to leave. He {{has no choice but to}} comply, but is disheartened, having at last won the sympathies of the parishioners. Barton believes that the request was unfair, knowing that the vicar's brother-in-law is in search of a new parish in which to work. However, he resigns himself to the move and at length obtains a living in a distant manufacturing town.|$|E

[...] Yang and Wei then suggested that An be promoted to be chancellor, and that his three commands be divided between his three deputies; Emperor Xuanzong initially agreed, but after the edict was drafted, Emperor Xuanzong tabled it and instead sent the eunuch Fu Qiulin (輔璆琳) to send fresh fruits to An and to observe him—upon which An bribed Fu into submitting a favorable report. [...] Yang, however, persisted in his reports against Yang, including having the mayor of Jingzhao arrest An's friend Li Chao (李超) and others and executing them secretly. [...] An's son An Qingzong (安慶宗), who was then at Chang'an, reported this to An Lushan, causing An Lushan to be even more apprehensive. [...] Subsequent events—including An's refusal to attend the funeral of an imperial prince in summer 755 and his offer to send a large number of horses to Chang'an in fall 755, began to cause Emperor Xuanzong to start suspecting An.

[...] However, Clendenon refused to report to Houston, electing to retire and take job with a pen manufacturing company. [...] The Astros asked Commissioner Bowie Kuhn to void the trade, but he refused. [...] Instead, he awarded Jack Billingham and a left-handed relief pitcher to the Astros to complete the trade. [...] Cuellar was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for Curt Blefary. [...] Other new players included catcher Johnny Edwards, infielder Denis Menke, and pitcher Denny Lemaster. [...] Wilson continued to pitch brilliantly and on May 1 threw the second no-hitter of his career. In that game, he struck out 18 batters, tying what was then the all-time single-game mark. [...] He was just 24 years of age and was second to only Sandy Koufax for career no-hit wins. Wilson's no-hitter lit the Astros' fire after a miserable month of April, and six days later the team tied a major league record by turning seven double plays in a game. [...] By May's end the Astros had put together a ten-game winning streak. The Houston infield tandem of Menke and Joe Morgan continued to improve, providing power at the plate and great defense. Morgan had 15 homers and stole 49 bases while Menke led the Astros with 90 RBIs. The Menke/Morgan punch was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> alive, and the team was responding to Walker's management style.
