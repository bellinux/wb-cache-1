5|$|<b>Beetles</b> {{are able}} to exploit a wide {{diversity}} of food sources available in their many habitats. Some are omnivores, eating both plants and animals. Other <b>beetles</b> are highly specialized in their diet. Many species of leaf <b>beetles,</b> longhorn <b>beetles,</b> and weevils are very host-specific, feeding on only a single species of plant. Ground <b>beetles</b> and rove <b>beetles</b> (Staphylinidae), among others, are primarily carnivorous and catch and consume many other arthropods and small prey, such as earthworms and snails. While most predatory <b>beetles</b> are generalists, a few species have more specific prey requirements or preferences.|$|E
5|$|Some longhorn <b>beetles</b> (Cerambycidae) are {{effective}} Batesian mimics of wasps. <b>Beetles</b> may combine coloration with behavioural mimicry, acting like the wasps they already closely resemble. Many other <b>beetles,</b> including ladybirds, blister <b>beetles,</b> and lycid <b>beetles</b> secrete distasteful or toxic substances {{to make them}} unpalatable or poisonous, and are often aposematic, where bright or contrasting coloration warn off predators; many <b>beetles</b> and other insects mimic these chemically protected species.|$|E
5|$|The multisegmented legs end {{in two to}} five small {{segments}} called tarsi. Like {{many other}} insect orders, <b>beetles</b> have claws, usually one pair, {{on the end of}} the last tarsal segment of each leg. While most <b>beetles</b> use their legs for walking, legs have been variously adapted for other uses. Aquatic <b>beetles</b> including the Dytiscidae (diving <b>beetles),</b> Haliplidae, and many species of Hydrophilidae, the legs, often the last pair, are modified for swimming, typically with rows of long hairs. Male diving <b>beetles</b> have suctorial cups on their forelegs that they use to grasp females. Other <b>beetles</b> have fossorial legs widened and often spined for digging. Species with such adaptations are found among the scarabs, ground <b>beetles,</b> and clown <b>beetles</b> (Histeridae). The hind legs of some <b>beetles,</b> such as flea <b>beetles</b> (within Chrysomelidae) and flea weevils (within Curculionidae), have enlarged femurs that help them leap.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} insect pests infest stored dry {{foods such as}} flour, cereals and pasta; these include the Indian mealmoth, the {{cigarette}} <b>beetle,</b> the drugstore <b>beetle,</b> the confused flour <b>beetle,</b> the red flour <b>beetle,</b> the merchant grain <b>beetle,</b> the sawtoothed grain <b>beetle,</b> the wheat weevil, the maize weevil and the rice weevil.|$|R
5|$|Adephaga {{contains}} about 10 families of largely predatory <b>beetles,</b> includes ground <b>beetles</b> (Carabidae), water <b>beetles</b> (Dytiscidae) and whirligig <b>beetles</b> (Gyrinidae). In these insects, the testes are tubular {{and the first}} abdominal sternum (a plate of the exoskeleton) is divided by the hind coxae (the basal joints of the beetle's legs).|$|E
5|$|All tansy <b>beetles</b> are small, rounded <b>beetles</b> {{approximately}} 7–12mm in length. There {{are both}} internal and external morphological differences between the six subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic <b>beetles</b> use several {{techniques}} for retaining air beneath the water's surface. Diving <b>beetles</b> (Dytiscidae) hold air between the abdomen and the elytra when diving. Hydrophilidae have hairs on their under surface that retain {{a layer of}} air against their bodies. Adult crawling water <b>beetles</b> use both their elytra and their hind coxae (the basal segment of the back legs) in air retention, while whirligig <b>beetles</b> simply carry an air bubble down with them whenever they dive.|$|E
50|$|Lasioderma serricorne, {{commonly}} known as the cigarette <b>beetle,</b> cigar <b>beetle,</b> or tobacco <b>beetle,</b> is an insect very similar in appearance to the drugstore <b>beetle</b> (Stegobium paniceum) and the common furniture <b>beetle</b> (Anobium punctatum). All three species belong to the family Anobiidae.|$|R

5|$|Archostemata {{contains}} four {{families of}} mainly wood-eating <b>beetles,</b> including reticulated <b>beetles</b> (Cupedidae) and the telephone-pole beetle.|$|E
5|$|Beetle larvae can be {{differentiated}} {{from other}} insect larvae by their hardened, often darkened heads, {{the presence of}} chewing mouthparts, and spiracles {{along the sides of}} their bodies. Like adult <b>beetles,</b> the larvae are varied in appearance, particularly between beetle families. <b>Beetles</b> with somewhat flattened, highly mobile larvae include the ground <b>beetles</b> and rove beetles; their larvae are described as campodeiform. Some beetle larvae resemble hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs. These are elateriform larvae, and are found in the click beetle (Elateridae) and darkling beetle (Tenebrionidae) families. Some elateriform larvae of click <b>beetles</b> are known as wireworms. <b>Beetles</b> in the Scarabaeoidea have short, thick larvae described as scarabaeiform, more commonly known as grubs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beetles</b> are {{prominent}} in human culture, from the sacred scarabs of ancient Egypt to beetlewing art and use as pets or fighting insects for entertainment and gambling. Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects of collection and decorative displays. Over 300 species {{are used as}} food, mostly as larvae; species widely consumed include mealworms and rhinoceros beetle larvae. However, the major impact of <b>beetles</b> on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural pests. Serious pests include the boll weevil of cotton, the Colorado potato beetle, the coconut hispine beetle, and the mountain pine beetle. Most <b>beetles,</b> however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the lady <b>beetles</b> and dung <b>beetles</b> are beneficial by helping to control insect pests.|$|E

5|$|<b>Beetles</b> can be {{beneficial}} to human economics by controlling the populations of pests. The larvae and adults of some species of lady <b>beetles</b> (Coccinellidae) feed on aphids that are pests. Other lady <b>beetles</b> feed on scale insects, whitefly and mealybugs. If normal food sources are scarce, they may feed on small caterpillars, young plant bugs, or honeydew and nectar. Ground <b>beetles</b> (Carabidae) are common predators of many insect pests, including fly eggs, caterpillars, and wireworms. Ground <b>beetles</b> can help to control weeds by eating their seeds in the soil, reducing the need for herbicides to protect crops. The effectiveness of some species in reducing certain plant populations {{has resulted in the}} deliberate introduction of <b>beetles</b> in order to control weeds. For example, the genus Zygogramma is native to North America but has been used to control Parthenium hysterophorus in India and Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Russia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beetles</b> have {{a variety}} of ways to communicate, {{including}} the use of pheromones. The mountain pine beetle emits a pheromone to attract other <b>beetles</b> to a tree. The mass of <b>beetles</b> are able to overcome the chemical defenses of the tree. After the tree's defenses have been exhausted, the <b>beetles</b> emit an anti-aggregation pheromone. The species can stridulate to communicate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beetles</b> {{typically}} have a particularly hard exoskeleton including the elytra, though {{some such as}} the rove <b>beetles</b> have very short elytra while blister <b>beetles</b> have softer elytra. The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects, although there are several examples of novelty, such as adaptations in water <b>beetles</b> which trap air bubbles under the elytra for use while diving. <b>Beetles</b> are endopterygotes, {{which means that they}} undergo complete metamorphosis, with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile pupal stage. Some, such as stag <b>beetles,</b> have a marked sexual dimorphism, the males possessing enormously enlarged mandibles which they use to fight other males. Many <b>beetles</b> are aposematic, with bright colours and patterns warning of their toxicity, while others are harmless Batesian mimics of such insects. Many <b>beetles,</b> including those that live in sandy places, have effective camouflage.|$|E
50|$|This lily <b>beetle</b> may be {{confused}} with the cardinal <b>beetle</b> (Pyrochroa serraticornis), which also has red elytra and a black underside. The wing cases of the lily leaf <b>beetle</b> are dimpled and are shinier and more rounded than those of the cardinal <b>beetle,</b> which are relatively dull, and narrower, flatter, and more elongated. The cardinal <b>beetle</b> also has comb-like antennae. The lily leaf <b>beetle</b> is herbivorous, while the cardinal <b>beetle</b> preys on insects. The lily leaf <b>beetle</b> is also confused with unspotted ladybirds, but it is narrower in shape.|$|R

50|$|The walnut twig <b>beetle</b> is not {{the first}} bark <b>beetle</b> to be {{associated}} with a species of Geosmithia. The deaths of black walnut trees associated with the walnut twig <b>beetle</b> are not caused by the <b>beetle</b> but instead Geosmithia morbida. The origin of Geosmithia morbida is not known, but experts strongly believe that its emergence is connected to the walnut tree <b>beetle</b> and the Arizona walnut tree, and was not caused by the transfer of the disease from another area but instead by an evolutionary change in a similar species of fungi that inhabited closely to where the <b>beetle</b> was first identified. The fungus and <b>beetle</b> have developed a symbiotic relationship in which the fungus allows itself to be eaten by the <b>beetle</b> in return for a ride to the fungi's next host. The walnut twig <b>beetle’s</b> hard shell covers two wings, and because the <b>beetle</b> can fly, Geosmithia morbida is reliant on the walnut twig <b>beetle</b> to be spread across distances, making the fungus entomochoric, or completely dependent upon the walnut twig <b>beetle</b> and only found in habitats with the <b>beetle.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Beetles,</b> both {{adults and}} larvae, are the prey of many animal predators {{including}} mammals from bats to rodents, birds, lizards, amphibians, fishes, dragonflies, robberflies, reduviid bugs, ants, other <b>beetles,</b> and spiders. <b>Beetles</b> {{use a variety}} of anti-predator adaptations to defend themselves. These include camouflage and mimicry against predators that hunt by sight, toxicity, and defensive behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Decaying {{organic matter}} {{is a primary}} diet for many species. This can range from dung, which is {{consumed}} by coprophagous species (such as certain scarab <b>beetles</b> in the Scarabaeidae), to dead animals, which are eaten by necrophagous species (such as the carrion <b>beetles,</b> Silphidae). Some <b>beetles</b> found in dung and carrion are in fact predatory. These include members of the Histeridae and Silphidae, preying on the larvae of coprophagous and necrophagous insects. Many <b>beetles</b> feed under bark, some feed on wood while others feed on fungi growing on wood or leaf-litter. Some <b>beetles</b> have special mycangia, structures for the transport of fungal spores.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} habitat specificity, {{many species of}} <b>beetles</b> have been {{suggested}} as suitable as indicators, their presence, numbers, or absence providing a measure of habitat quality. Predatory <b>beetles</b> such as the tiger <b>beetles</b> (Cicindelidae) have found scientific use as an indicator taxon for measuring regional patterns of biodiversity. They are suitable for this as their taxonomy is stable; their life history is well described; they are large and simple to observe when visiting a site; they occur {{around the world in}} many habitats, with species specialised to particular habitats; and their occurrence by species accurately indicates other species, both vertebrate and invertebrate. According to the habitats, many other groups such as the rove <b>beetles</b> in human-modified habitats, dung <b>beetles</b> in savannas and saproxylic <b>beetles</b> in forests have been suggested as potential indicator species.|$|E

5|$|The Cretaceous saw the fragmenting of the {{southern}} landmass, {{with the opening of}} {{the southern}} Atlantic Ocean and the isolation of New Zealand, while South America, Antarctica, and Australia grew more distant. The diversity of Cupedidae and Archostemata decreased considerably. Predatory ground <b>beetles</b> (Carabidae) and rove <b>beetles</b> (Staphylinidae) began to distribute into different patterns; the Carabidae predominantly occurred in the warm regions, while the Staphylinidae and click <b>beetles</b> (Elateridae) preferred temperate climates. Likewise, predatory species of Cleroidea and Cucujoidea hunted their prey under the bark of trees together with the jewel <b>beetles</b> (Buprestidae). The diversity of jewel <b>beetles</b> increased rapidly, as they were the primary consumers of wood, while longhorn <b>beetles</b> (Cerambycidae) were rather rare: their diversity increased only towards the end of the Upper Cretaceous. The first coprophagous <b>beetles</b> are from the Upper Cretaceous and may have lived on the excrement of herbivorous dinosaurs. The first species where both larvae and adults are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle are found. Whirligig <b>beetles</b> (Gyrinidae) were moderately diverse, although other early <b>beetles</b> (e.g. Dytiscidae) were less, with the most widespread being the species of Coptoclavidae, which preyed on aquatic fly larvae.|$|E
