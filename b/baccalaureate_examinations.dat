2500|$|The University of Chicago {{requires}} all undergraduates {{to fulfill}} the Common Core, which demands work across {{all areas of the}} liberal arts for both A.B. and B.S. concentrators, albeit in a form reduced from the Hutchins era. Currently, 15 courses are required in addition to tested foreign language proficiency (one year of [...] study being expected as preparation) if no Advanced Placement or International <b>Baccalaureate</b> <b>examinations</b> are used for exemption (a reduction of six credits, or two full-time quarters, may be achieved via this method). While the science curriculum has largely followed the intellectual evolution of its respective fields, the requisite humanities and social science sequences now have several variants that encompass non-Western, non-canonical, and critical theory texts. This is a departure from the school’s traditional ties to texts of the European tradition such as Plato and Locke. While in totality the core curriculum’s goal is to impart an education that is both timeless and a vehicle for interdisciplinary debate, the increasing number of options to students within its confines produces a wide variety of backgrounds amongst graduates.|$|E

In particular, analyses were performed to determine whether the earlier start date assisted in increasing attendance rates during the first twenty days and/or aided in decreasing the proportion of students that began the school year after the first school day.
