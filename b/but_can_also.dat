5|$|A {{pulmonary}} contusion {{is usually}} caused directly by blunt trauma <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> result from explosion injuries or a shock wave associated with penetrating trauma. With {{the use of}} explosives during World Wars I and II, pulmonary contusion resulting from blasts gained recognition. In the 1960s its occurrence in civilians began to receive wider recognition, in which cases it is usually caused by traffic accidents. The use of seat belts and airbags reduces the risk to vehicle occupants.|$|E

5|$|Another popular {{method of}} growing {{synthetic}} diamond is {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD). The growth occurs under low pressure (below atmospheric pressure). It involves feeding a mixture of gases (typically 1 to 99 methane to hydrogen) into a chamber and splitting them to chemically active radicals in a plasma ignited by microwaves, hot filament, arc discharge, welding torch or laser. This method is mostly used for coatings, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> produce single crystals several millimeters in size (see picture).|$|E
5|$|Banksia brownii, {{commonly}} known as feather-leaved banksia or Brown's banksia, is a species of shrub that grows in southwest Western Australia. An attractive plant with fine feathery leaves and large red-brown flower spikes, it usually grows as an upright bush around two metres (7ft) high, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> occur as a small tree or a low spreading shrub. First collected in 1829 and published the following year, it is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, section Oncostylis, series Spicigerae. There are two genetically distinct forms.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham is a snowy city {{relative}} to other large UK conurbations, due to its inland location and comparatively high elevation. Between 1961 and 1990 Birmingham Airport averaged 13.0 days of snow lying annually, compared to 5.33 at London Heathrow. Snow showers often pass through the city via the Cheshire gap on north westerly airstreams, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> come off the North Sea from north easterly airstreams.|$|E

5|$|DKA happens {{most often}} in those with type 1 {{diabetes}}, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> occur in those {{with other types of}} diabetes under certain circumstances. Triggers may include infection, not taking insulin correctly, stroke, and certain medications such as steroids. DKA results from a shortage of insulin; in response the body switches to burning fatty acids which produces acidic ketone bodies. DKA is typically diagnosed when testing finds high blood sugar, low blood pH, and ketoacids in either the blood or urine.|$|E
5|$|HST's {{guidance}} system {{can also be}} used as a scientific instrument. Its three Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) are primarily used to keep the telescope accurately pointed during an observation, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be used to carry out extremely accurate astrometry; measurements accurate to within 0.0003arcseconds have been achieved.|$|E
5|$|Hidden Markov {{models are}} {{probabilistic}} models that can assign likelihoods to all possible combinations of gaps, matches, and mismatches {{to determine the}} most likely MSA or set of possible MSAs. HMMs can produce a single highest-scoring output <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> generate a family of possible alignments that can then be evaluated for biological significance. HMMs can produce both global and local alignments. Although HMM-based methods have been developed relatively recently, they offer significant improvements in computational speed, especially for sequences that contain overlapping regions.|$|E

5|$|Leotia lubrica favours damp {{deciduous}} woodland, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> {{be found}} under conifers. Particular favoured habitats include path sides and underneath bracken, while favoured substrates include soil, moss and plant waste, where it feeds as a saprotroph. Fruit bodies are typically encountered from late summer to late autumn in Europe, and from late spring to autumn in North America, {{where it is}} the most common Leotia species. It has also been recorded in eastern Asia, in China and Tibet, as well as in New Zealand and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Muqarnas are elaborately carved {{ceilings}} to semi-domes, {{often used}} in mosques. They are typically made of stucco (and thus {{do not have a}} structural function), <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be of wood, brick, and stone. They are characteristic of Islamic architecture of the Middle Ages from Spain and Morocco in the west to Persia in the east. Architecturally they form multiple tiers of squinches, diminishing in size as they rise. They are often elaborately decorated.|$|E
5|$|Naming is a {{symbolic}} {{tradition of the}} islands' Maori population. Names form a link not only to ancestors, descendents, and friends, but to titles and land, as well as events and relationships. Dreamed or created, name change {{are not limited to}} events, such as birth, marriage, and death, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> occur in association with a bad omen. First names are interchangeable between men and women, while surnames can vary from person to person within a family unit.|$|E

5|$|Neuroblastoma (NB) {{is a type}} {{of cancer}} that forms in certain types of nerve tissue. It most {{frequently}} starts from one of the adrenal glands, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> develop in the neck, chest, abdomen, or spine. Symptoms may include bone pain, a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest, or a painless bluish lump under the skin.|$|E
5|$|Onions are {{cultivated}} {{and used}} around the world. As a food item, {{they are usually}} served cooked, as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be eaten raw or used to make pickles or chutneys. They are pungent when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which irritate the eyes.|$|E
5|$|Pork steaks are {{generally}} {{cut from the}} shoulder of the pig, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be cut from the loin or leg of the pig. Shoulder steaks are cut from the same primal cut of meat most commonly used for pulled pork, and can be quite tough without long cooking times due to the high amount of collagen in the meat; therefore, pork shoulder steaks are often cooked slower than a typical beef steak, and may be stewed or simmered in barbecue sauce during cooking.|$|E

5|$|Sai Baba's {{real name}} remains unknown. The name 'Sai' {{was given to}} him by Mhalsapati when he arrived at Shirdi, a town now in the west Indian state of Maharashtra. The word 'Sai' refers to a {{religious}} mendicant <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> mean 'God'. In several Indian and Middle Eastern languages the term 'Baba' is an honorific signifying grandfather, father, old man or sir. Thus Sai Baba denotes holy father, saintly father or (venerable) poor old man.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals are intelligent, {{with some}} {{possessing}} large brains, self-awareness and tool use. Mammals can communicate and vocalize {{in several different}} ways, including the production of ultrasound, scent-marking, alarm signals, singing, and echolocation. Mammals can organize themselves into fission-fusion societies, harems, and hierarchies, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be solitary and territorial. Most mammals are polygynous, but some can be monogamous or polyandrous.|$|E
5|$|The parsnip {{is usually}} cooked, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be eaten raw. It {{is high in}} {{vitamins}} and minerals, especially potassium. It also contains antioxidants and both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. It can be cultivated in deep, stone-free soils. It is attacked by the carrot fly and other insect pests, viruses, and fungal diseases, of which canker is the most serious. Handling the stems and foliage can cause a skin rash if the skin is exposed to sunlight after handling.|$|E
