50|$|During 1941, {{the second}} {{prototype}} {{was engaged in}} flight trials to support the manufacturing effort, such as the in-flight testing of an alternative tail configuration, which was determined to have improved the Warwick's handling. The prototype was refitted with production standard engines and propellers; this revealed problems with engine ignition, which were resolved with a revised <b>booster</b> <b>coil.</b> During this time, the Warwick was subject to {{a high level of}} investigation with the aim of keeping the type relevant to the rapidly changing circumstances of the conflict; it was out of this process that a relatively orderly progression towards standardised production was soon made.|$|E
50|$|The Zil-111 was a {{limousine}} {{produced by the}} Soviet car manufacturer ZiL in 1958-1967. It was the first post-war limousine designed in the Soviet Union. After tests with the shortlived prototype ZIL-Moscow in 1956, which gained {{a place in the}} Guinness Book of Records as the largest passenger car in the world, the ZIL-111 was introduced from ZIL in 1958. The body style was in the American tradition of the time and resembled the mid-1950s cars built by Packard, an American luxury automobile manufacturer, although, apart from the similar styling, the car was an original design and had nothing in common with them, except in general layout. The interiors were trimmed with top quality leather and broadcloth and decorated with thick pile carpet and polished wooden fittings. It featured a comprehensive ventilation and heating system and a 5-band radio, all of which could be controlled from the rear, electric windows, vacuum-operated screen wash, windshield and front door window defrosting. It was powered by a 6.0 L V8 engine producing 200 hp connected to an automatic transmission (similar to that of Chrysler's PowerFlite and influenced by it, but different in design) giving a top speed of 170 km/h, hydraulic drum brakes with a vacuum servo <b>booster,</b> <b>coil</b> and wishbone IFS. The car won a top prize at the Brussels Expo World Fair in 1958.|$|E
