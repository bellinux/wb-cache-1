5|$|Nestlings have dark grey {{or brown}} down, cream to grey bills, cream gapes and orange throats. The plumage of {{juvenile}} <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> their first moult {{resembles that of}} the adult female, but the head and upperparts are streaked and slightly darker. Soon after fledging, juveniles moult into their first immature plumage, and more closely resemble the adult female. The breasts of male birds may have some orange feathers. <b>Birds</b> <b>in</b> their second year moult into a second immature phase, some males of which may resemble adult males, while others retain a more immature brown plumage. Determining the age and sex of <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> brown plumage can be very difficult. Information on exact timing of moulting is lacking, but the replacement of primary feathers takes place over the summer months between December and February.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} many known cases of {{population}} bottleneck in the recent past. Prior {{to the arrival of}} Europeans, North American prairies were habitat for millions of greater prairie chickens. In Illinois alone, their numbers plummeted from about 100 million <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> 1900 to about 50 <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> the 1990s. The declines in population resulted from hunting and habitat destruction, but the random consequence has been a loss of most of the species' genetic diversity. DNA analysis comparing birds from the mid century to <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> the 1990s documents a steep decline in the genetic variation in just in the latter few decades. Currently the greater prairie chicken is experiencing low reproductive success. However, bottleneck and genetic drift can lead to a genetic loss that increases fitness as seen in Ehrlichia.|$|E
