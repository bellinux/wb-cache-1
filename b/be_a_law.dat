25|$|Higgins J {{agreed with}} the {{majority}} that sections 5 and 8 of the Act were beyond power, but, having rejected the reserved powers doctrine in his dissent in R v Barger, and the Union Label case, his Honour reasons were significantly different. Higgins J distinguished between the status of corporations and the rights and liabilities attaching to that status, holding that the trade and commerce power and the corporations power were mutually exclusive. In this case the Act was substantially with respect to trade and commerce and thus it could not validly <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>law</b> with respect to corporations.|$|E

2500|$|By April 1868, with anti-Jewish pogroms {{occurring}} at Bacău and elsewhere, Fătu and 30 other deputies presented an antisemitic law proposal, one radical {{enough to be}} criticized by Brătianu, who deemed it uncivilized. Claiming to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>law</b> on [...] "the regularization {{of the state of}} Jews in Romania", Fătu's project notably banned Jews from settling anywhere in the countryside, and also from purchasing land.

2500|$|To {{illustrate}} the theory, Stephen Mumford gives {{the example of}} all ravens are black. Under the theory of Armstrong, Tooley and Dretske, there is a relation of necessity between the universals ravenhood and blackness, rather than there being a relationship with every single raven. This allows the explanation of laws of nature {{that have not been}} instantiated. Mumford cites the frequently-used example of the moa bird: [...] "It is supposed that every bird of this now-extinct species died at a young age, though not because of anything in its genetic makeup. Rather, it died mainly because of some virus that just happened to sweep through the population. One bird could have escaped the virus only to be eaten by a predator on the day before its fiftieth birthday." [...] Under the theory of Armstrong, Tooley and Dretske, such a coincidence would not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>law</b> of nature.|$|E

2500|$|Many Wiccans {{believe in}} magic, a {{manipulative}} force exercised through {{the practice of}} witchcraft or sorcery. Many Wiccans agree with the definition of magic offered by ceremonial magicians, such as Aleister Crowley, who declared that magic was [...] "the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will", while another prominent ceremonial magician, MacGregor Mathers stated that it was [...] "the science of {{the control of the}} secret forces of nature". Many Wiccans believe magic to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>law</b> of nature, as yet misunderstood or disregarded by contemporary science, and as such they do not view it as being supernatural, but a part of what Leo Martello calls the [...] "super powers that reside in the natural". Some Wiccans believe that magic is simply making full use of the five senses in order to achieve surprising results, whilst other Wiccans do not claim to know how magic works, merely believing that it does because they have observed it to be so. Some spell it [...] "magick", a variation coined by the influential occultist Aleister Crowley, though this spelling is more commonly associated with Crowley's religion of Thelema than with Wicca.|$|E
2500|$|Philo {{interpreted}} the curses of [...] regarding moving landmarks and misleading the blind to apply allegorically to virtue and vice. Philo noted that Moses included among his curses (in [...] ) removing a neighbor's landmark, and Philo {{interpreted the}} landmark to represent virtue, which God placed before humankind as {{the tree of}} life (in [...] ) to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>law</b> for the soul. But pleasure, taught Philo, removed this landmark of virtue, placing in its stead the landmark of vice, the tree of death. Philo taught that pleasure was therefore worthy to be cursed, being a passion, which altered the boundaries of the soul, rendering the soul a lover of the passions instead of a lover of virtue. And thus Philo interpreted [...] "And the Lord God said to the serpent, '... You are cursed over every creature and over all the beasts of the field,'" [...] to apply to the passion of pleasure. And Philo read [...] "Cursed is he who causes the blind man to wander in the road," [...] also to speak of pleasure. Philo taught that impious pleasure caused the blind to wander, for the outward sense, devoid of reason, is blinded by nature, and the eyes of its reason are put out. Philo taught that it is by reason alone that we attain a true comprehension of things, and not by the outward senses. Pleasure deceived the outward senses, persuading the outward senses to follow a blind guide, making the mind utterly unable to restrain itself. Only through reason does the mind see clearly, and mischievous things become less formidable in their attacks. But pleasure has put such great artifices in operation to injure the soul that it has compelled the soul to use them as guides, cheating it, and persuading it to exchange virtue for evil habits and vice.|$|E
