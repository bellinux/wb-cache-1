Rather he believed that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force, which he sometimes described as a nervous fluid, drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity similar to the mediaeval great chain of being.|$|E
5|$|Author Michael Occleshaw {{made the}} claim in his 1995 book The Romanov Conspiracies: The Romanovs and the House of Windsor that Tatiana {{might have been}} rescued and transported to England, where she married a British officer and lived under the name Larissa Tudor. Occleshaw based this claim on {{studying}} the diaries of the British agent Richard Meinertzhagen, who hinted at the successful liberation of a Grand Duchess, allegedly Tatiana. However, historians discount this claim. Survival stories persist because two bodies were missing from the mass grave found in the forest outside Yekaterinburg and exhumed in 1991. Those bodies were identified as Tsarevich Alexei {{and one of the}} four grand duchesses, generally thought by Russians to be Grand Duchess Maria and by Americans to be Grand Duchess Anastasia. Most historians <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> of the Romanovs, including Tatiana, were assassinated at Ekaterinburg.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed, in his Philosophie Zoologique of 1809, {{a theory}} of the {{transmutation}} of species (transformisme). Lamarck did not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> living things shared a common ancestor but rather that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity that {{was related to the}} great chain of being. Lamarck recognized that species adapted to their environment. He explained this by saying that the same innate force driving increasing complexity caused the organs of an animal (or a plant) to change based on the use or disuse of those organs, just as exercise affects muscles. He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment. It was this secondary mechanism of adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that would become known as Lamarckism and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The poem's {{focus on}} France {{served as a}} way for Southey to discuss his {{feelings}} about the French Revolution. In particular, Southey was upset that the British were calling men from their farms to serve as a militia during the time. In terms of the French, Southey did not support Robespierre and the others who followed him in France. However, he did support the idea of the French Republic. When he heard of Marie Antoinette's execution in October 1793, Southey told his friend Bedford that he condemned the action although he held to his Republican beliefs. However, he was further upset when word came that Brissot, the Girondin leader, was executed. This caused him to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> of the countries were equally bad, except the Republican United States, which he hoped to make his home. In 1794, many of Southey's feelings on Robespierre's involvement in these actions were included in both Joan of Arc and the Fall of Robbespierre, which followed after Robespierre's own execution. However, Southey had by then become very radical and believed that Robespierre was a great man who only helped mankind in his actions.|$|E

25|$|Deontological {{issues are}} issues {{about whether a}} person has an ethical duty or {{responsibility}} to take an action. Nearly all scholars and societies around the world agree that voluntarily donating organs to sick people is ethically permissible. Although nearly all scholars encourage organ donation, fewer scholars <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> people are ethically required to donate their organs after death. Similarly, nearly all religions support voluntary organ donation as a charitable act of great benefit to the community, although a few small groups, like the Roma (gypsies), oppose organ donation on religious grounds. Issues surrounding patient autonomy, living wills, and guardianship make it nearly impossible for involuntary organ donation to occur.|$|E
25|$|Active {{surveillance}} involves {{monitoring the}} tumor {{for signs of}} growth or the appearance of symptoms. The monitoring process may involve serial PSA, physical examination of the prostate, and/or repeated biopsies. The goal of surveillance is to avoid overtreatment and the sometimes serious, permanent side effects of treatment for a slow-growing or self-limited tumor that would never cause any problems for the person. This approach is not used for aggressive cancers, but it may cause anxiety for people who wrongly <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> cancer is deadly or themselves to have life-threatening cancer. For 50% to 75% of people with prostate cancer it will cause no harm before a person dies from other causes.|$|E
25|$|Most liberal Muslims {{believe that}} Islam {{promotes}} {{the notion of}} absolute equality of all humanity, {{and that it is}} one of its central concepts. Therefore, a breach of human rights has become a source of great concern to most liberal Muslims. Liberal Muslims differ with their culturally conservative counterparts in that they <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> humanity is represented under the umbrella of human rights. Many Muslim majority countries have signed international human rights treaties, but the impact of these largely remains to be seen in local legal systems – a point highlighted by the fact that most countries which impose conservative interpretations of Shariah law are amongst the most repressive countries in the world, while secular states are often the most open and tolerant.|$|E

25|$|LGBT {{movements}} are opposed {{by a variety}} of individuals and organizations. Some social conservatives <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> sexual relationships with people other than an opposite-sex spouse undermine the traditional family and that children should be reared in homes with both a father and a mother. Some opponents of gay rights say that such rights may conflict with individuals' freedom of speech, religious freedoms in the workplace, the ability to run churches, charitable organizations and other religious organizations in accordance with one's religious views, and that the acceptance of homosexual relationships by religious organizations might be forced through threatening to remove the tax-exempt status of churches whose views do not align with those of the government. Some critics charge that political correctness has led to the association of sex between males and HIV being downplayed.|$|E

This belief of a single god with many incarnations or 'faces' came to {{be reflected in the}} Guild's House of Black and White, which contains a public shrine with idols of many death gods, including the Stranger of the Faith of the Seven. The worshipers of the Many-Faced God believe that death is a merciful end to suffering. God may grant a 'gift' of death to those worthy. In the Guild's temple, those who seek an end to suffering may drink from a poisonous fountain.|$|E

Anti-whaling campaigners argue that scientific studies are not currently clear enough to warrant resumption of commercial whaling. Moreover, there are various other issues such as welfare of whales which is beyond the simple matter of conservation. (See The arguments for and against whaling) These issues have global relevance which is not restricted only to whaling and whaling countries. Moreover, public opinion in many anti-whaling countries is solidly behind the governmental position on whaling within the IWC. Pro-whaling countries, on the other hand, argue that the public's anti-whaling stance is often based on misinformation – a 2003 article in The Economist noted that surveys in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States had found that a majority of respondents incorrectly <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> whale species are endangered.|$|E
