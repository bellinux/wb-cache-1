25|$|The {{interaction}} of most ligands with their binding sites {{can be characterized}} {{in terms of a}} binding affinity. In general, high-affinity ligand binding results from greater intermolecular force <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>ligand</b> <b>and</b> its receptor while low-affinity ligand binding involves less intermolecular force <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>ligand</b> <b>and</b> its receptor. In general, high-affinity binding results in a higher degree of occupancy for the ligand at its receptor binding site than is the case for low-affinity binding; the residence time (lifetime of the receptor-ligand complex) does not correlate. High-affinity binding of ligands to receptors is often physiologically important when some of the binding energy can be used to cause a conformational change in the receptor, resulting in altered behavior of an associated ion channel or enzyme.|$|E

The toxicity of current therapies as well as drug resistance exhibited by certain T. vaginalis strains underscores the need for new treatment options. One possibility involves the purine salvage pathway, which is well known for its importance in organisms. Key enzymes in the protozoan pathway, one of which is purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), exhibit important differences from the human homologs, indicating that inhibitors could be identified that affect TvPNP but not the human pathway, as a new class of chemotherapeutic agents against the T. vaginalis parasite.
