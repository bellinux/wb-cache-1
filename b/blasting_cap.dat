5|$|After {{the appeals}} had been exhausted, Illinois Governor Richard James Oglesby {{commuted}} Fielden's and Schwab's sentences {{to life in}} prison on November 10, 1887. On the eve of his scheduled execution, Lingg committed suicide in his cell with a smuggled <b>blasting</b> <b>cap</b> which he reportedly held in his mouth like a cigar (the blast blew off half his face and he survived in agony for six hours).|$|E
5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids {{have either}} pyrotechnic applications or associated properties. Boron and silicon are commonly encountered; they act somewhat like metal fuels. Boron {{is used in}} pyrotechnic initiator compositions (for igniting other hard-to-start compositions), and in delay compositions that burn at a constant rate. Boron carbide {{has been identified as}} a possible replacement for more toxic barium or hexachloroethane mixtures in smoke munitions, signal flares and fireworks. Silicon, like boron, is a component of initiator and delay mixtures. Doped germanium can act as a variable speed thermite fuel. Arsenic trisulfide As2S3 was used in old naval signal lights; in fireworks to make white stars; in yellow smoke screen mixtures; and in initiator compositions. Antimony trisulfide Sb2S3 is found in white-light fireworks and in flash and sound mixtures. Tellurium has been used in delay mixtures and in <b>blasting</b> <b>cap</b> initiator compositions.|$|E
25|$|On 8 May 1985, Reyat {{bought a}} Micronta digital {{automobile}} clock at the Radio Shack store in Duncan. Designed for a 12-volt automobile electrical system, {{it could also}} be powered by a 12-volt lantern battery. The 24-hour alarm activated a buzzer, but he returned a week later for an electrical relay after asking how to get the buzzer signal to power another device. Wiretappers recorded nine telephone calls between Parmar's residence in Vancouver and Reyat from either his residence or workplace on Vancouver Island that month, which got Reyat added to the list of persons being monitored for terrorist activities. The Canadian government would later accuse Reyat of lying in 2003 when at first {{he said he did not}} know what three clocks he had bought could be used for. He later said Parmar needed an explosive device to blow up a bridge or something large in India, and that he needed timers for an explosive device. In that case, the relay could be used to trigger the detonator circuit for a <b>blasting</b> <b>cap</b> which would provide the initial shock needed to detonate larger explosives such as dynamite.|$|E
50|$|Bickfordâ€™s fuse {{not only}} {{dramatically}} improved the safety conditions of mines around the world, but {{also contributed to}} the development of dynamite. Alfred Nobel created dynamite in 1867, by moulding nitroglycerine and a mud-like compound found near his laboratories called kieselguhr into individual cylinders. At the end of each cylinder Nobel inserted a <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> which could be ignited in one of two ways. First, by inserting a safety fuse into the <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> and igniting the fuse, it will set the <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> off and produce enough energy to detonate the dynamite. Second, it is possible to detonate dynamite by inserting a <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> into the end of the cylinder and then by attaching an electrical wire into the <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> and producing a current which will travel from the source to the <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> will also set off the dynamite.|$|R

50|$|In addition, confessions by the convicted {{perpetrators}} {{describe the}} bombs as ammonium nitrate-based explosives. Most {{of the components}} of the bombs such as <b>blasting</b> <b>caps</b> and detonating cords were discovered to have come from the city of Talisay in the southern province of Cebu. The town itself is known for the production of <b>blasting</b> <b>caps</b> used in illegal fishing.|$|R
500|$|McVeigh {{rented a}} storage {{space in which}} he stockpiled seven crates of [...] Tovex sausages, 80 spools of shock tube, and 500electric {{blasting}} caps, which he and Nichols had stolen from a Martin Marietta Aggregates quarry in Marion, Kansas. He decided not to steal any of the [...] of ANFO (ammonium nitrate/fuel oil) he found at the scene, as {{he did not believe}} it to be powerful enough (although he did obtain seventeenbags of ANFO from another source for use in the bomb). McVeigh made a prototype bomb using a plastic Gatorade jug containing ammonium nitrate prills, liquid nitromethane, a piece of Tovex sausage, and a <b>blasting</b> <b>cap.</b> The prototype was detonated in the desert to avoid detection.|$|E
2500|$|No bomb {{parts were}} {{recovered}} from the ocean, but investigations of the blast at Tokyo established that the bomb {{had been placed in}} a Sanyo stereo tuner of a series that had been shipped to Vancouver in Canada. The RCMP assigned no less than 135 officers to check every store that could have sold Sanyo tuners, leading to the discovery of a recent sale to mechanic Inderjit Singh Reyat in his hometown of Duncan, British Columbia. RCMP contacted the CSIS and found they were already investigating the Sikh activists; RCMP learned that CSIS already had wiretaps and had observed Reyat and Parmar at the test blast near Duncan, and had recovered <b>blasting</b> <b>cap</b> shunts and a paper bundle wrapper from a <b>blasting</b> <b>cap.</b> A search recovered the receipt for a Sanyo Tuner Model FMT-611K with invoice with his name and phone number, along with sales of other bomb components. It was not until January 1986 that Canadian investigators at the Canadian Aviation Safety Board concluded that a bomb explosion in the forward cargo hold had downed the airliner. On 26 February 1986, Supreme Court Judge Kirpal of India presented an inquiry report based on investigation conducted by H.S. Khola (the [...] "Khola Report"). The report also concluded that a bomb originating in Canada brought down the Air India flight.|$|E
2500|$|Lt. Mott {{and his two}} sergeants {{found about}} [...] of unexploded charges {{on top of one}} of the piers. They {{discovered}} that one of the steel pipes containing the wires connecting to the main charge had been severed, possibly by artillery. Combat engineers also found a [...] demolition charge of TNT had not exploded when the <b>blasting</b> <b>cap</b> failed. A Polish worker later said another worker had tampered with the blasting caps, though his claims could not be verified. The Americans later conducted an intensive search for additional German demolitions and found another [...] in wells inside the piers.|$|E

5000|$|A {{detonator}} {{contains an}} easy-to-ignite primary explosive {{that provides the}} initial activation energy to start the detonation in the main charge. Explosives commonly used in detonators include mercury fulminate, lead azide, lead styphnate and tetryl and DDNP. <b>Blasting</b> <b>caps</b> and some detonators are stored separately and not inserted into the main explosive charge until just before use, keeping the main charge safe. Early <b>blasting</b> <b>caps</b> also used silver fulminate {{but it has been}} replaced with cheaper and safer primary explosives.Silver azide is still used sometimes,but very rarely due to its high price.|$|R

5000|$|A typical [...] "capacitive discharge" [...] {{blasting}} machine works by charging a capacitor from a battery, then discharging the capacitor through an external circuit, called the firing line, {{to fire the}} <b>blasting</b> <b>cap.</b> While the machine is idle, an [...] "internal shunt" [...] is connected across the output terminals so that any stray voltages induced in the external circuit, for example by nearby radio transmitters, are harmlessly short-circuited without triggering the <b>blasting</b> <b>cap.</b> The machines also typically include an [...] "abort" [...] feature to discharge the internal capacitor without firing the cap.|$|E

25|$|To {{create the}} {{symmetrical}} implosion required to compress the plutonium to the required density, thirty-two explosive charges were simultaneously detonated around the spherical core. Using conventional explosive techniques with <b>blasting</b> <b>caps,</b> progress towards achieving simultaneity {{to within a}} small fraction of a microsecond was discouraging. Alvarez directed Johnston to use a large capacitor to deliver a high voltage charge directly to each explosive lens, replacing <b>blasting</b> <b>caps</b> with exploding-bridgewire detonators.

50|$|A detonator, {{frequently}} a <b>blasting</b> <b>cap,</b> is {{a device}} used to trigger an explosive device. Detonators can be chemically, mechanically, or electrically initiated, {{the latter two}} being the most common.|$|E
