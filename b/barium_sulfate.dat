40|$|The most {{important}} source for barite on Earth is often associated to sedimentary exhalative sulfide deposits (SedEx) and volcanic environments generated by hydrothermal activity. BaSO 4 is {{also related to}} epithermal deposits in volcanic rocks and is a common gangue mineral in veins and fractures due to wall rock alteration [1]. Thus, these minerals often reflect close environmental compositions and are therefore interesting for the understanding of volcanogenic and hydrothermal activity on terrestrial planets. In this study, we present our first results of selected samples from an ongoing spectral and geochemical investigation on <b>barium</b> <b>sulfates</b> (barite minerals, provided by Deutsche Baryt-Industry, Bad Lauterberg).

5|$|After {{delivery}} of the barium-lanthanum material to Los Alamos, it was stored in a dedicated building in the Bayo Canyon Site. At first, the mixture was used as-is, both barium and lanthanum together, but this led to unpleasant radioactive contamination that {{took a long time}} to disappear as the half-life of barium-140 is 12.5 days. Shortly after, the process was improved; barium was removed chemically, by double precipitation from a solution as <b>barium</b> <b>sulfate.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Barium</b> <b>sulfate</b> as a {{contrast}} medium was {{evolved from the}} prior use of bismuth preparations which were too toxic. The use of bismuth preparations had been described as early as 1898. <b>Barium</b> <b>sulfate</b> as {{a contrast}} medium in medical practice was introduced {{largely as a result}} of the works of Krause a director of the Bonn Polyclinic, now the medical faculty of the University of Bonn and his colleagues Bachem and Gunther. In a paper read in 1910 at the radiological congress they advocated for the use of <b>barium</b> <b>sulfate</b> as an opaque contrast medium in medicine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Barium</b> <b>sulfate</b> is swallowed, which {{because it}} is a radio opaque {{substance}} does not allow the passage of X-rays. As a result, areas coated by <b>barium</b> <b>sulfate</b> will appear white on an X-ray film. The passage of barium through the gastrointestinal tract is observed by a radiologist using a fluoroscope attached to a TV monitor. The radiologist takes a series of individual X-ray images at timed intervals depending on the areas to be studied. Sometimes medication which produces gas in the gastrointestinal tract is administered together with the <b>Barium</b> <b>sulfate.</b> This gas distends the gastrointestinal lumen, providing better imaging conditions and in this case the procedure is called double-contrast imaging.|$|E

Two pathways of catalyst deactivation by SO 2 were identified. Under lean conditions (exposure to SO 2 and O 2) at 350 °C the storage component forms <b>barium</b> <b>sulfates,</b> which transform from surface to hardly reducible bulk sulfate species. The irreversible blocking of the Ba sites led to a decrease in NOx storage capacity. Under fuel rich conditions (SO 2 /C 3 H 6) at 350 – 500 °C evidence {{for the formation of}} sulfides on the oxidation/reduction component (Pt) of the catalyst was found, which blocks the metal surface and thus hinders the further reduction of the sulfides...|$|R
40|$|In the oil field, {{due to the}} {{extensive}} use of water injection for oil displacement and pressure maintenance, many reservoirs experience the problem of scale deposition when injection water begins to break through. Experience {{in the oil industry}} has indicated that many oil wells have suffered flow restriction because of scale deposition within the oil producing formation matrix and the down-hole equipment, generally in primary, secondary and tertiary oil recovery operation as well as scale deposits in the surface production equipment. This study was conducted to investigate the permeability reduction caused by deposition of calcium, strontium, and <b>barium</b> <b>sulfates</b> in sandstone cores from mixing of injected sea water and formation water that contained high concentration of calcium, barium, and strontium ions at various temperatures (50 - 80 Â°C) and differential pressures (100 - 200 psig).

40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of laboratory experiments carried out to investigate the formation of calcium, strontium and <b>barium</b> <b>sulfates</b> from mixing Angsi seawater or low sulfate seawater with the following sulfate contents (75, 50, 25, 5 and 1 %) and formation water contain high concentration of calcium, strontium and barium ions at various temperatures (40 - 90 °C) and atmospheric pressure. The knowledge of solubility of common oil field scale formation and how their solubilities are affected by changes in salinity and temperatures is also studied. Results show a large of precipitation occurred in all jars containing seawater while the amount of precipitation decreased when the low sulfate seawater was used. At higher temperatures the mass of precipitation of CaSO 4 and SrSO 4 scales increases and the mass of precipitation of BaSO 4 scale decreases since the solubilities of CaSO 4 and SrSO 4 scales decreases and the solubility of BaSO 4 increases with increasing temperature.

25|$|Radiographic {{examinations}} involve {{radiation exposure}} {{in the form}} of X-rays. Although barium ions are toxic, their use is generally regarded as safe because the small amounts of barium ions available in solution and absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract are deemed to be negligible; however, isolated cases of barium encephalopathy have been described following absorption of barium from the intestinal tract. Constipation and abdominal pain may occur after barium meals. The formation of baroliths, which may need to be removed surgically, is a complication of the use of <b>barium</b> <b>sulfate.</b> <b>Barium</b> <b>sulfate</b> may cause serious peritoneal irritation. Leakage of <b>Barium</b> <b>sulfate</b> into the abdominal cavity may occur in people with duodenal ulcers or other perforations and may lead to peritonitis, adhesion, and granulomas; it is associated with a high mortality rate. Leakage of barium into the mediastinum or peritoneal cavity may lead to endotoxic shock, which is often fatal; as a result, the use of barium as a contrast agent is contraindicated when there is a suspicion or possibility of compromise of bowel wall integrity. Aspiration or inhalation of <b>barium</b> <b>sulfate</b> into the lungs during oral application can lead to serious respiratory complications leading to fatal aspiration pneumonia or asphyxiation. Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions are rare but some additives contained in barium preparations may induce immune reactions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} work reported in this volume {{is the development of}} a process for the separation and subsequent purification of radium from the K- 65 (pitchblende) residue. Except for the accumulation of additional experimental data the process is essentially complete. After a preliminary extraction of about 85 % of the lead and 40 % of the silica with a 40 % sodium hydroxide solution, the residue is treated with a solution containing both sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate to obtain additional lead removal and partial conversion of the radium and <b>barium</b> <b>sulfates</b> to carbonates. After leaching out the soluble carbonates, the residue containing unconverted sulfates is treated with a sodium carbonate solution at 170 {sup o} under pressure. A study of the amount and concentration of sodium carbonate required to obtain a satisfactory conversion of the sulfates has shown that the total sodium carbonate may be reduced by 40 % and that smaller volumes of solution may be employed without serious decrease in the efficiency of the conversion. In order to make calculations on the number of steps and tank sizes for the radium-barium separation by fractional precipitation, equations have been developed to calculate this information from the theoretical separation factors determined experimentally. Three methods for carrying out the radium-barium separation by fractional precipitation of chromates have been studied and the separation factors determined. The methods differ in the reagent and temperature employed for the neutralization of the nitric acid solution of the chromates. The separation factor improves with decrease in temperature, and a marked improvement has been found by replacing urea which requires boiling temperatures for hydrolysis with potassium cyanate which hydrolyzes at much lower temperatures...|$|R

40|$|N RECENT YEARS, {{clinical}} chemists {{have turned}} their attention to the use of submicro procedures for the determination of normal and pathologic constituents of body fluids.

Despite this trend, there stifi exists a need for a combined analytic procedure adaptable to the rapid and accurate processing of many specimens-on the scale frequently encountered in the laboratory of a large hospital, yet employing minute amounts of sample. This procedure should be able to determine several important biochemical constituents without resort to intricate collection procedures, expen-sive and specialized equipment, nor should extensive retraining of the analyst performing these determinations be required.

40|$|The common {{methods for}} {{determining}} inorganic soil sulfate {{may be affected}} by the extraction of sulfate from organic sulfur compounds such as ester sulfates. In order to test this, various synthetic organic sulfur compounds (ranging from ester sulfates to sulfonates and C-bonded sulfur) were extracted with deionized water or with two common sulfate extractors (0. 5 M NaHCO 3 and 0. 02 M NaH 2 PO 4). Similar amounts of dissolved sulfate were detected in all extracts of the aromatic ester sulfate hydroxyquinoline sulfate. Sulfate was not released from aliphatic ester sulfates or C-bonded sulfur. Ion chromatography was compared to a turbidimetric method for the determination of sulfate. The latter method, based on BaSO 4 -precipitation, appeared to be unsuitable for determining sulfate in organically influenced solutions. <b>Barium</b> precipitated <b>sulfate</b> as well as ester sulfates. Furthermore, the photometry of BaSO 4 was influenced by specific absorption of dissolved organic compounds, leading to a misinterpretation of the sulfate concentration in the solution...|$|R

25|$|In {{the first}} {{extraction}} of radium Curie used the residues after extraction of uranium from pitchblende. The uranium had been extracted by dissolution in sulfuric acid leaving radium sulfate, {{which is similar}} to <b>barium</b> <b>sulfate</b> but even less soluble in the residues. The residues also contained rather substantial amounts of <b>barium</b> <b>sulfate</b> which thus acted as a carrier for the radium sulfate. The first steps of the radium extraction process involved boiling with sodium hydroxide followed by hydrochloric acid treatment to remove as much as possible of other compounds. The remaining residue was then treated with sodium carbonate to convert the <b>barium</b> <b>sulfate</b> into barium carbonate carrying the radium, thus making it soluble in hydrochloric acid. After dissolution the barium and radium are reprecipitated as sulfates and this was repeated one or few times, for further purification of the mixed sulfate. Some impurities, that form insoluble sulfides, were removed by treating the chloride solution with hydrogen sulfide followed by filtering. When the mixed sulfate were pure enough they were once more converted to mixed chloride and barium and radium were separated by fractional crystallisation while monitoring the progress using a spectroscope (radium gives characteristic red lines in contrast to the green barium lines), and the electroscope.|$|E

40|$|Internationally {{distributed}} {{organic and}} inorganic oxygen isotopic reference materials have been calibrated by six laboratories carrying {{out more than}} 5300 measurements {{using a variety of}} high-temperature conversion techniques (HTC) a in an evaluation sponsored by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry GUPAC). To aid in the calibration of these reference materials, which span more than 125 parts per thousand, an artificially enriched reference water (delta O- 18 of + 78. 91 parts per thousand) and two <b>barium</b> <b>sulfates</b> (one depleted and one enriched in 180) were prepared and calibrated relative to VSMOW 2 (b) and SLAP reference waters. These materials were used to calibrate the other isotopic reference materials in this study, which yielded: [GRAPHICS] The seemingly large estimated combined uncertainties arise from differences in instrumentation and methodology and difficulty in accounting for all measurement bias. They are composed of the 3 -fold standard errors directly calculated from the measurements and provision for systematic errors discussed in this paper. A primary conclusion {{of this study is that}} nitrate samples analyzed for delta O- 18 should be analyzed with internationally distributed isotopic nitrates, and likewise for sulfates and organics. Authors reporting relative differences of oxygen-isotope ratios (delta O- 18) of nitrates, sulfates, or organic material should explicitly state in their reports the 3180 values of two or more internationally distributed nitrates (USGS 34, IAEA-NO- 3, and USGS 35), sulfates (IAEA-SO- 5, IAEA-SO- 6, and NBS 127), or organic material (IAEA- 601 benzoic acid, IAEA- 602 benzoic acid, and IAEA- 600 caffeine), as appropriate to the material being analyzed, had these reference materials been analyzed with unknowns. This procedure ensures that readers will be able to normalize the delta O- 18 values at a later time should it become necessary. The high-temperature reduction technique for analyzing delta O- 18 and delta H- 2 is not as widely applicable as the well-established combustion technique for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope determination. To obtain the most reliable stable isotope data, materials should be treated in an identical fashion; within the same sequence of analyses, samples should be compared with working reference materials that are as similar in nature and in isotopic composition as feasible.

40|$|Abstract: The Karalar barite-galena {{deposits}} {{are typical}} examples of carbonate-hosted barite-galena deposits that occur widely {{in the central}} Taurides. Recent mining activity has been concentrated in the Byk and BoyalÝk mine areas. The mineralisation occurs as ore veins along fault zones and as ore-filled breccia zones along the strongly deformed lower walls of limestone blocks in the Permian limestones of the BÝkÝcÝ Formation. These veins contain mainly barite (80 — 85 %) and galena (10 — 15 %), and lesser amounts of sphalerite, pyrite, fahlore, limonite, quartz and calcite as gangue minerals. Barite developed during an early episode of mineralisation and was mylonitised before the precipitation of other minerals. Trace-element geochemical studies show that Ba and Pb may have been derived from different sources: Ba is enriched in mudstones of the Ordovician akmak Formation, and Pb is enriched in limestones of the Permian BÝkÝcÝ Formation. The trends of the REEs—Y profiles and the plots {{of the values of}} barites and galenas on the CeN/SmN versus CeN/YbN diagram indicate that a seawater-dominated hydrothermal fluid supplied the <b>barium</b> and <b>sulfate</b> ions and deposited the barite, while a fluid mixture of seawater and a Tibetan-type (terrestrial) hydrothermal fluid was responsible for galena deposition.

As a further test supplementing those previously carried out during model development, we have calculated the temperature at which standard seawater becomes saturated with respect to anhydrite. The model predicts that, upon heating at 500 bars, standard seawater becomes saturated with respect to anhydrite at 147 � 5 °C, which compares well with the literature value of 150 °C (Bishoff and Seyfried, 1978). At 20 bars the calculated saturation temperature is 117 � 3 °C. This points to a non negligible pressure effect even at moderate pressures.
