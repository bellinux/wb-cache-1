40|$|This thesis explores {{current and}} {{historical}} child custody laws in <b>the</b> State <b>of</b> Arizona {{and how they}} have correlated with child development theories. It discusses the impact child development theories have had on Arizona child custody cases. Additionally, it includes an overview of early Arizona Supreme Court cases and the implications it has on <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. The thesis also provides insight to problems with Arizona courts and the actors involved with making the decision for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. The investigation demonstrates a disconnection between judicial discretion and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child standard. An example from the United States Supreme Court case Troxel v Granville (1999) is reviewed to illustrate how courts discretion, in general, can be misused. Overall, court discretion in Arizona is liberal and the impact it has on child custody decisions can sometimes conflict with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child...|$|R

During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center, learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the <b>Best</b> <b>Interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child (1973). She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale–New Haven Hospital and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor. In the summer of 1970 she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman's Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers' issues including education, health and housing. Edelman later became a significant mentor. Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey, with Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the ways in which}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child has been used as an argument for state-authorized assessments of persons who are aspiring to parenthood, but who are not yet parents, i. e. of parent potential rather than parental performance. The policies included in the analysis concern three different areas in which assessment of parental potential is made: adoption, assisted reproduction and presumptive parents with intellectual disabilities. <b>The</b> status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child as an argument for state-authorized assessments of parent potential, I argue, varies with <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> involvement from state authorities that is needed in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> creating a family. The state claims the right to assess <b>the</b> parent potential <b>of</b> individuals only when it contributes to <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> families in which there are no or only partial biogenetic links between parents and child.
