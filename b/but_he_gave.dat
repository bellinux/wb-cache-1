5|$|On May 3, 2014, {{following}} a match between Christian York and Drolix, Hardy defeated Drolix {{to become the}} new MCW Heavyweight Champion. On June 14, 2014 at House of Hardcore 6, Hardy defeated Tommy Dreamer and Carlito in a three-way TLC match. At Maryland Championship Wrestling's Shane Shamrock Cup, Hardy defeated Luke Hawx in a TLC match for Hardy's MCW Heavyweight title and Hawx Extreme Rising World title. Hardy won the match, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> back the title to Hawx. On October 4, Hardy lost the MCW Heavyweight Chamapionship back to Drolix, following outside interference from Kevin Eck.|$|E
25|$|Ludwig van Beethoven {{revolutionized}} timpani {{music in}} the early 19th century. He not only wrote for drums tuned to intervals other than a fourth or fifth, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> a prominence to the instrument as an independent voice beyond programmatic use. For example, his Violin Concerto (1806) opens with four solo timpani strokes, and the scherzo of his Ninth Symphony (1824) sets the timpani (tuned an octave apart) against the orchestra {{in a sort of}} call and response.|$|E
25|$|Muybridge and Stanford {{had a major}} falling-out {{concerning}} his research on equine locomotion. Stanford had asked his friend and horseman Dr. J. B. D. Stillman {{to write a book}} analysing The Horse in Motion, which was published in 1882. Stillman used Muybridge's photos as the basis for his 100 illustrations, and the photographer's research for the analysis, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> Muybridge no prominent credit. The historian Phillip Prodger later suggested that Stanford considered Muybridge as just one of his employees, and not deserving of special recognition.|$|E

25|$|His basic {{assumptions}} {{were very}} similar to those of Le Sage and Preston, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> a more detailed application of the kinetic theory. However, by asserting that the velocity of the corpuscles after collision was reduced without any corresponding increase in the energy of any other object, his model violated the conservation of energy. He noted that there is a connection between the weight of a body and its density (because any decrease in the density of an object reduces the internal shielding) so he went on to assert that warm bodies should be heavier than colder ones (related to the effect of thermal expansion).|$|E
25|$|The king's {{death and}} {{cremation}} was to inspire {{the creation of}} an order of nuns. Buddhist texts record that the Buddha was reluctant to ordain women. His foster mother Maha Pajapati, for example, approached him, asking to join the sangha, but he refused. Maha Pajapati, however, was so intent on the path of awakening that she led a group of royal Sakyan and Koliyan ladies, which followed the sangha on a long journey to Rajagaha. In time, after Ananda championed their cause, the Buddha is said to have reconsidered and, five years after the formation of the sangha, agreed to the ordination of women as nuns. He reasoned that males and females had an equal capacity for awakening. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> women additional rules (Vinaya) to follow.|$|E
25|$|In February 1770 Captain James Cook {{described}} the saddle-shaped hill which {{became known as}} Saddle Hill, the landmark east of Mosgiel. The Weller brothers of the Otago whaling station on Otago Harbour (modern Otakou) sent a Mr. Dalziel to inspect the Taieri Plain for a proposed Scottish settlement in 1839, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> an unfavourable report. In 1844 Edward Shortland noticed Māori running pigs on the landward slopes of Saddle Hill orMakamaka (as he recorded the hill's Māori name). Charles Kettle surveyed the plain and coastal hills for the Otago Association in 1846 and 1847. He also climbed the westward hills and saw the raised land beyond, the nearest approach of the Central Otago plateau to the sea, which he correctly identified as potentially fine pastoral country.|$|E

5000|$|Hobart finds {{fault with}} the indeterminist's position, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> the typical overstatement by a determinist critic, that any chance {{will be the}} direct cause of our actions, which of course would clearly be a loss of freedom and {{responsibility}} ...|$|R
25|$|Karl Quilter sculpted {{his first}} Angel Moroni in 1978. Two sizes were made, one three meters high, the other {{just over two}} meters. These statues were {{designed}} {{to reduce the cost}} and weight of the previous Angel Moroni statues, in order to become a standard part of the temple architecture. The Quilter angels are made of fiberglass and covered with gold leaf. In 1998, with the construction of many new smaller temples, Quilter was commissioned to create a new angel. This angel was similar in design to his previous angels, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> Moroni a slightly larger build, with his left hand opened and his body turned slightly to show more action. The Bern Switzerland Temple's Angel Moroni is patterned after Quilter's 1998 design. Quilter's Angel Moroni is now on over one hundred temples around the world.|$|E
500|$|The ship {{carrying}} William Arnold and {{his group}} sailed from England to New England in 1635, with some brief particulars of the voyage given by his son Benedict in the family record: [...] "Memorandom {{my father and his}} family Sett Sayle from Dartmouth in Old England, the first of May, friday [...] Arrived In New England June 24 Ano 1635". [...] The name of the ship was not recorded, nor has it been identified since. [...] Governor Winthrop recorded that 15 ships arrived in the Massachusetts Bay area in the six-week period beginning 4 June 1635, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> the names of only two of them.|$|E
500|$|On November 17, 2008, Affeldt {{signed a}} twoyear {{deal with the}} San Francisco Giants. He said of signing with them, [...] "With that {{starting}} rotation, the bullpen won't get burned out." [...] Affeldt immediately began having a career year with the Giants. He was used on Opening Day against the Milwaukee Brewers, and he pitched a scoreless inning in the Giants' 106 win. On April 12, he entered {{a game against the}} Padres with one out and the bases loaded in the sixth inning. Affeldt got Brian Giles to ground into a double play to end the inning, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> up two runs (one earned) in the seventh as the Padres won 61.|$|E
50|$|Practical {{numbers were}} used by Fibonacci in his Liber Abaci (1202) in {{connection}} with the problem of representing rational numbers as Egyptian fractions. Fibonacci does not formally define practical numbers, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> a table of Egyptian fraction expansions for fractions with practical denominators.|$|R

500|$|The other {{commonly}} formulated {{generalization of}} Cesàro summation is {{the sequence of}} (C, n) methods. It has been proven that (C, n) summation and (H, n) summation always give the same results, but they have different historical backgrounds. In 1887, Cesàro came close to stating the definition of (C, n) summation, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> only a few examples. In particular, he summed [...] to [...] by a method that may be rephrased as (C, n) but was not justified as such at the time. He formally defined the (C, n) methods in 1890 in order to state his theorem that the Cauchy product of a (C, n)-summable series and a (C, m)-summable series is (C, m + n + 1)-summable.|$|E
500|$|But {{where he}} will be missed the most will be among {{those people who have}} been sharers of his bounty. [...] Their name is legion. [...] He gave quietly, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> liberally. [...] It was true of him that he did not let his right hand know what his left hand did. [...] Very {{frequently}} the recipient of his bounty could only guess from whence the gift came. [...] He aided the needy in distress in thousands of ways. [...] He seemed to have some occult way of finding out that people needed assistance at certain times, and then he knew how to come to their aid without offending. [...] Hundreds whom the public would never dream had needed his assistance blessed his name as they gazed upon his features for the last time, because he came to them in a substantial way at a critical time. [...] This is where and by whom he will be missed the most. [...] Truly he was a great man.|$|E
500|$|Ravel was not by {{inclination}} a teacher, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> {{lessons to}} a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them. Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent. Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters. He warned Rosenthal {{that it was impossible}} to learn from studying Debussy's music: [...] "Only Debussy could have written it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound." [...] When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they [...] "would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity". The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams, who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08. Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from [...] "the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner... Complexe mais pas compliqué was his motto." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{next day}} is the awards ceremony. Mr. Kyle is <b>given</b> the prize, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> it to Billy instead, saying that <b>he</b> earned it <b>but</b> {{not to get too}} cocky because he and his Walkers were going to whip Billy and his Redbones next year.|$|R

500|$|A {{total of}} 775 people {{attended}} the event. Canadian Online Explorer writer Jason Clevett rated the entire event a 7 out of 10, which {{was higher than}} the 6½ out of 10 given to the 2006 Slammiversary event by Chris Sokol. Clevett did not rate TNA's previous event Hard Justice, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> a rating of 6 out of 10 to TNA's Lockdown. Slammiversary was marked lower than TNA's next PPV event No Surrender on July 17, which was given an 8 out of 10 by Clevett. Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment's Vengeance PPV event held on June26, Slammiversary was rated higher: Sokol gave Vengeance a 6 out of 10. Clevett felt that overall Slammiversary was a [...] "very good event". Regarding the King of the Mountain match, Clevett thought it [...] "was fun". Although, he felt the rules were [...] "so convoluted and confusing that it ended up being a complicated spotfest". When speaking of the TNA X Division Championship match, Clevett wrote {{that it had a}} [...] "good blend of the storyline involving Sabin, Trinity, Shane and Traci Brooks, Daniels fighting to keep his belt and some killer spots". Clevett gave his highest match rating of 8 out of 10 in his review to the X Division and World Tag Team Championship matches. He gave his lowest rating of 4 out of 10 to The Outlaw versus Ron Killings, Samoa Joe versus Sonjay Dutt, and AMW versus the 3Live Kru bouts. Clevett gave the main event a 7 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rap-Up in March 2010, Minaj revealed the title to the song, and Garrett later hinted around details around his single with Minaj, stating, [...] "I just did Nicki’s first single featuring me. It’s gonna be a fucking bomb. It’s very, very explosive! It’s a club banger. It’s a lot broader than what people would expect her to come with. The record puts her in the game {{in a way that}} says she should’ve been here a long time ago. She has a real way of how she wants to do this. It’s just gonna be a surprise when it comes. She just wants to make it as huge as possible." [...] Additionally, co-producer Alex da Kid said, [...] "I started on the train and finished in the studio. I knew it was special from the start. It wasn't like I was aiming for Nicki with this track; I had a idea I thought was crazy. Nicki heard it and the rest was history." [...] In {{an interview}} with MTV News, Minaj stated when she first heard the song she felt she was in Africa {{and fell in love with}} the drum beats, and commented, [...] "It's a very rare. ... You're not gonna get the song the first time you hear it. After the second or third time, you're gonna be like, 'Whoa, what is this?' It sounds nothing like anything that's out right now." [...] She also called the song [...] "next-level futuristic", and said that she chose Garrett for the song in that he would be the best to [...] "illustrate Nicki Minaj", as he got her and her personality". In an interview on the set of the video shoot for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said, [...] "I'm excited for people to hear me ... doing more than one verse. It's really creative. I wanted to be theatrical, but I am very serous about what I do." [...] Also on the set of the video, Garrett said, [...] "We wanted to give her something that was global," [...] he continued. [...] "We wanted to give her something that was urban; we wanted to give her something that was mainstream pop, you know what I mean, that the world could get a chance to see her out on this pedestal. And of course, you know, I had to come along with her, because I've got an album dropping soon." [...] The song made its debut March 29, 2010 on WQHT. The song leaked onto the Internet on March 30, 2010, the day before its music video premiere on 106 & Park. The single's art cover was revealed on April 1, 2010, featuring a still of Minaj in the music video as a ninja and comic book font designs. Alex da Kid said that a lot of artists wanted the beat such as Jamie Foxx and Young Jeezy <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> it to Nicki because it fit her [...] "quirky, left-field vibe." ...|$|E
