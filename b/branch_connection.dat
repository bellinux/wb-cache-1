The line towards Swansea opened on 14 December 1894 to goods; it left the Briton Ferry Dock line (at Briton Ferry Junction) and crossed under the GWR main line, then running northwards, {{following}} close on its east side through Briton Ferry village. It was difficult to make a route through this section, as the GWR line, housing and industrial works were all close together; in fact the route picked its way at the back of houses, and the station was on an embankment between two rows of houses.|$|E

40|$|High {{acoustic}} energy {{is known to}} cause vibrations in pipes, and in some severe cases acoustic induced vibration can lead to fatigue failure at <b>branch</b> <b>connections</b> with high stress concentration. Industry guidelines suggest using mitigation measures such as fabricated full wrap-around reinforcement pad (re-pad) or Sweepolet fittings at <b>branch</b> <b>connections.</b> Effectiveness of these mitigation measures is evaluated via a finite element analysis of four types of branch connections; (i) Sockolet, (ii) Sockolet with 2 ” wide partial re-pad, (iii) Sockolet with full wrap-around re-pad, and (iv) Sweepolet. Four distinct acoustic frequency ranges (1 / 3 octave bands) with associated sound pressure levels are used as the excitation source. Maximum stress levels in the main header pipe at the branch tie-in are monitored to assess the potential for vibration damage. Of the four <b>branch</b> <b>connections,</b> Sockolet with full wrap-around re-pad {{is found to be}} least susceptible to damage, followed by the Sweepolet.

These joints are constructed welding together two straight pipes at different angles respect to their axis and the Stress Intensification Factors (SIFs) of the welded area are readily available from the standards for stress analysis purposes. Nevertheless, branches manufactured using elbows are occasionally encountered during Fitness-For-Service evaluations of the older carbon-steel pipelines conveying fluids at low pressure and room temperature.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} using continuous beam analytical differential equation method to dynamics behavior design of complex heat transfer orthotropic platens {{which are used}} in the recovery boilers. The goal is to obtain a predictive model for increasing the reliable useful operation time. The platens are supported vertically with fixed ends. They are loaded by hot flue gas and by accumulating mass loads due to operation conditions. The loads cause alternating stresses fracturing tube <b>branch</b> <b>connections.</b> The beam deflection and bending stress histories at the junction of tube and chamber are obtained using an analytical beam model. The model gives the lowest eigenfrequency close to the measured value which is somewhat larger than that obtained by FEM model. The beam model can be used for further optimal redesign of the tube <b>branch</b> <b>connections</b> and the mean time to failure of the process equipment...|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{strength}} and growth stresses in the wood of <b>branches,</b> <b>branch</b> <b>connections,</b> and furcations of trees revealed mechanisms which these alleged weak spots employ to counteract materials failure. Fractometer III measurements documented that the wood on the lower side of a branch is adapted to the prevailing compressive load. Its axial compression strength is {{significantly higher than the}} compression strength of the wood on the upper side of a branch and also of trunk wood. Wood in <b>branch</b> <b>connections</b> and forks subjected to high loads and stresses in a direction transverse to the grain as a result of tensile stresses has a clearly higher tangential bending strength than wood in surrounding areas less subjected to stresses. Studies of wood anatomy indicated connections between the compression strength of branch wood and the thickness of the lignified cell wall layers. The high strength in <b>branch</b> <b>connections</b> and forks was attributed to a special grain structure in those areas. Growth stresses were determined in forks which expose the wood on the circumference and in the middle region of the enclosed bark to a compressive pre-stress. Residual tensile stresses were recorded in the regions in between. Callus imposes compressive stresses on the occluded wood. In forked branches, residual compressive stresses enhance the safety against failure by introducing load-induced tensile stresses in a direction transverse to the direction of the grain. (orig.)

40|$|TutorialPump piping systems {{typically}} have small diameter <b>branch</b> <b>connections</b> that can develop vibration related fatigue failures due to mechanical excitation. Many installations {{do not take}} time to design small diameter piping to avoid this issue. However, the risk of fatigue failure of small diameter <b>branch</b> <b>connections</b> can be reduced using two alternative guidelines developed by the Energy Institute and GMRC/PRCI. This tutorial will show that the guidelines {{can be used in}} two ways. In the design stage, it will show the user how to design small diameter piping in a way that reduces the risk of vibration problems. For piping that is already installed, the tutorial will show the end user how to screen branch lines for susceptibility to fatigue failure and reduce or eliminate the vibration problems by adding clamps, changing the piping diameter, or changing the number or type of valves. Case studies of real world small bore piping connections will be used to demonstrate the method an end user would use to screen branch lines and, if necessary, reduce vibration problems in the piping and avoid future fatigue failures. Both guidelines will be applied to all case studies, and the resulting recommendations will be compared to demonstrate the benefits, assumptions, and limitations of both guidelines and give the user {{a better understanding of the}} screening criterion used...|$|R
