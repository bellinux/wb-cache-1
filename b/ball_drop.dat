First held on December 31, 1907, to welcome 1908, the <b>ball</b> <b>drop</b> has been held annually since, except in 1942 and 1943 in observance of wartime blackouts.|$|E
5|$|As {{a public}} event, the festivities and <b>ball</b> <b>drop</b> are {{broadcast}} {{as part of}} New Year's Eve television specials originating from Times Square on several major U.S. television networks and cable channels. By far the most notable of these is Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve; created, produced, and originally hosted by the entertainer Dick Clark {{until his death in}} 2012, and currently hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Jenny McCarthy, the program first aired on NBC in 1972 before moving to ABC, where it has been broadcast ever since. New Year's Rockin' Eve has consistently been the most-watched New Year's Eve special in the U.S. annually, peaking at 22.6 million viewers for its 40th edition in 2012. Following the death of Dick Clark in April 2012, a crystal engraved with his name was added to the 2013 ball in tribute.|$|E

40|$|For each of {{a series}} of {{full-scale}} floor-ceiling assemblies, standard impact measurements were made with the sources defined in ISO 10140 including the tapping machine, the modified tapping machine, and the heavy/soft impact source (rubber <b>ball),</b> <b>dropped</b> from various heights. Additionally, sound recordings were made of the sounds generated by the <b>ball</b> <b>drops</b> and by adult walkers without shoes. The standard impact measurements were used to calculate standardized metrics and non-standardized variants. The recordings of the walkers' footfalls and of the "thumps" resulting from the <b>ball</b> <b>drops</b> were played back in a controlled laboratory room to listening test participants, who subjectively rated the reproduced sounds in terms of relative "annoyance". Preliminary results from 19 bare floors (i. e., no coverings) indicated: that listeners ranked the floor assemblies slightly differently for the walkers than for the ball drops; and that some objective metrics determined from measurements with the standard tapping machine and with the rubber impact ball correlated most highly with the subjective response to both types of impact sounds.

Both the Coca-Cola sign and Samsung LED displays were built by LED display manufacturer Daktronics. Times Square's first environmentally friendly billboard powered by wind and solar energy was first lit on December 4, 2008. On completion, the 20 Times Square development will host the largest LED signage in Times Square at 18,000 square feet. The display will be 1,000 square feet larger than the Times Square Walgreens display and one of the largest video-capable screens in the world.|$|E
25|$|The city started {{rebuilding}} the plaza in 2010, hiring {{the design and}} landscaping firm Snøhetta to permanently replace Broadway's roadway with custom-made granite pavers and benches. By December 2013, {{the first phase of}} the Times Square pedestrian plaza had been completed at the southern end of the square in time for the Times Square <b>Ball</b> <b>drop</b> on New Year's Eve. The project was originally intended to be completed by the end of 2015. The entire project was finally completed just before New Year's Eve 2016. Some safety bollards were also installed as part of the renovation in order to prevent vehicular attacks or collisions on the sidewalk. After a car crash that killed one person and injured 22 others on May 18, 2017, there were calls to install more bollards along Times Square.|$|E
25|$|On December 31, 1907, a ball {{signifying}} New Year's Day {{was first}} dropped at Times Square, and the Square {{has held the}} main New Year's celebration in New York City ever since. On that night, {{hundreds of thousands of}} people congregate to watch the Waterford Crystal ball being lowered on a pole atop the building, marking the start of the new year. It replaced a lavish fireworks display from the top of the building that was held from 1904 to 1906, but stopped by city officials because of the danger of fire. Beginning in 1908, and for more than eighty years thereafter, Times Square sign maker Artkraft Strauss was responsible for the ball-lowering. During World War II, a minute of silence, followed by a recording of church bells pealing, replaced the <b>ball</b> <b>drop</b> because of wartime blackout restrictions. Today, Countdown Entertainment and One Times Square handle the New Year's Eve event in conjunction with the Times Square Alliance.|$|E
