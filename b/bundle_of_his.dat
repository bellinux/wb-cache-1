5|$|Although Purkinje {{fibers and}} the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> were {{discovered}} {{as early as}} the 19th century, their specific role in the electrical conduction system of the heart remained unknown until Sunao Tawara published his monograph, titled Das Reizleitungssystem des Säugetierherzens, in 1906. Tawara's discovery of the atrioventricular node prompted Arthur Keith and Martin Flack to look for similar structures in the heart, leading to their discovery of the sinoatrial node several months later. These structures form the anatomical basis of the electrocardiogram, whose inventor, Willem Einthoven, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1924.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} {{is found in}} {{the upper part of the}} right atrium near to the {{junction}} with the superior vena cava. The electrical signal generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium in a radial way that is not completely understood. It travels to the left atrium via Bachmann's bundle, such that the muscles of the left and right atria contract together. The signal then travels to the atrioventricular node. This is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the atrioventricular septum—the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle. The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the electrical signal cannot pass through, which forces the signal to pass through the atrioventricular node only. The signal then travels along the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> to left and right bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart. In the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the heart muscle.|$|E
25|$|These purkinje fibers (p-fibers) {{found in}} the hearts {{moderator}} bands are a specialized cardiac muscle fiber that causes the heart to contract. The purkinje cells are mostly found within both the endocardium and the sub-endocardium. The sinoatrial node shows a small concentration of purkinje fibers, however, continuing through the conducting pathway of the heart the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shows the highest amount of these purkinje fibers.|$|E
5000|$|Legend {{also holds}} that a zealot lama built chortens along a road in Bumthang {{in order to}} {{propagate}} Buddhism in early times. He named each chorten with the suffix -ji, meaning [...] "berry," [...] after <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> blessed berries fell along the route.|$|R
25|$|Amiodarone slows {{conduction}} {{rate and}} prolongs the refractory {{period of the}} SA and AV nodes. It also prolongs the refractory periods <b>of</b> the ventricles, <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> <b>His,</b> and the Purkinje fibres without exhibiting any effects on the conduction rate. Amiodarone {{has been shown to}} prolong the myocardial cell action potential duration and refractory period and is a non-competitive ß-adrenergic inhibitor.|$|R
50|$|Young Bill's {{interest}} in art began {{at a young}} age. As a child of 6 young William took chalk to the sidewalks, decorating the concrete with elaborate picture stories of cowboys and Indians that extended around the block. As a child {{on the way to}} school, Bill used to lug <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother's piecework sewing to the sweatshops by which she was employed.|$|R
25|$|Electrical {{activity}} in the normal human heart begins when a cardiac action potential arises in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which {{is located in the}} right atrium. From there, the electrical stimulus is transmitted via internodal pathways to the atrioventricular (AV) node. After a brief delay at the AV node, the stimulus travels through the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> to the left and right bundle branches and then to the Purkinje fibers and the endocardium at the apex of the heart, then finally to the ventricular myocardium.|$|E
25|$|During each heartbeat, {{a healthy}} heart has an orderly {{progression}} of depolarization {{that starts with}} pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node, spreads out through the atrium, passes through the atrioventricular node down into the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> and into the Purkinje fibers, spreading down {{and to the left}} throughout the ventricles. This orderly pattern of depolarization gives rise to the characteristic ECG tracing. To the trained clinician, an ECG conveys a large amount of information about the structure of the heart and the function of its electrical conduction system. Among other things, an ECG can be used to measure the rate and rhythm of heartbeats, the size and position of the heart chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart's muscle cells or conduction system, the effects of cardiac drugs, and the function of implanted pacemakers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{heartbeat}} of a {{human embryo}} begins at approximately 21 days after conception, or five weeks after the last normal menstrual period (LMP), which is the date normally used to date pregnancy in the medical community. [...] The electrical depolarizations that trigger cardiac myocytes to contract arise spontaneously within the myocyte itself. The heartbeat is initiated in the pacemaker regions and spreads {{to the rest of}} the heart through a conduction pathway. Pacemaker cells develop in the primitive atrium and the sinus venosus to form the sinoatrial node and the atrioventricular node respectively. Conductive cells develop the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> and carry the depolarization into the lower heart.|$|E

2500|$|The cardiac action {{potential}} {{plays an important}} role in coordinating the contraction of the heart. The cardiac cells of the sinoatrial node provide the pacemaker potential that synchronizes the heart. The {{action potential}}s of those cells propagate to and through the atrioventricular node (AV node), which is normally the only conduction pathway between the atria and the ventricles. Action potentials from the AV node travel through the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> and thence to the Purkinje fibers. [...] Conversely, anomalies in the cardiac action potential—whether due to a congenital mutation or injury—can lead to human pathologies, especially arrhythmias. Several anti-arrhythmia drugs act on the cardiac action potential, such as quinidine, lidocaine, beta blockers, and verapamil.|$|E
2500|$|The human {{embryonic}} heart begins beating approximately 21 days after fertilization, or five {{weeks after the}} last normal menstrual period (LMP), which is the date normally used to date pregnancy in the medical community. [...] The electrical depolarizations that trigger cardiac myocytes to contract arise spontaneously within the myocyte itself. The heartbeat is initiated in the pacemaker regions and spreads {{to the rest of}} the heart through a conduction pathway. Pacemaker cells develop in the primitive atrium and the sinus venosus to form the sinoatrial node and the atrioventricular node respectively. Conductive cells develop the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> and carry the depolarization into the lower heart. Cardiac activity is visible beginning at approximately 5 weeks of pregnancy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primitive}} ventricle acts as initial pacemaker. But this pacemaker {{activity is}} actually {{made by a}} group of cells that derive from the sinoatrial right venous sinus. These cells form an ovoid [...] sinoatrial node (SAN), on the left venous valve. After the development of the SAN, the superior endocardial cushions begin to form a pacemaker as known as the atrioventricular node. With the development of the SAN, a band of specialized conducting cells start to form creating the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> that sends a branch to the right ventricle and one to the left ventricle. Most conduction pathways originate from the cardiogenic mesoderm but the sinus node may be derived from the neural crest.|$|E

60|$|The two men laughed heartily. The elder took {{a little}} <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> notes from <b>his</b> pocket {{and handed them to}} the boy.|$|R
60|$|They {{wondered}} what it could be, and were very much surprised when he appeared, carrying a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> papers in <b>his</b> hand.|$|R
60|$|Still, he had {{no thought}} of {{breaking}} the engagement which he had made. He went to his room, made a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> worldly possessions, and crept {{out of the back}} door, down the road to the circus.|$|E
60|$|Except the roisterers in the tavern, {{the village}} folk were abed. David crept softly {{into his room}} in the shed of his father's cottage and made a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> small store of clothing. With this upon a staff, he set his face outward upon the road that ran from Vernoy.|$|E
60|$|For {{the black}} man had made a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bracelets and shell {{necklaces}} and little gold ornaments and had traveled many miles into another country, where the ancient and royal tribe of hippopotamuses was unknown. And he set up for a great chief, because of his riches, and people bowed down before him.|$|E
60|$|Laura hesitated, puzzled. Just {{then the}} Professor came cantering {{in with a}} <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> grass in <b>his</b> hand. He {{glanced down at the}} Chinaman.|$|R
60|$|The {{gentleman in}} the bag wig laid <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> papers on <b>his</b> lordship's table, and his lordship silently {{selected}} one and turned over the leaves.|$|R

6000|$|Round {{the central}} figure of Byron are grouped his {{relations}} and friends, {{and two of the}} most interesting features in the volume are the strength of his family affections, and the width, if not the depth, of his capacity for friendship. His father died when the child was only three years old. But a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> letters, written from Valenciennes to his sister, Mrs. Leigh, in 1790-91, still exists, to attest, with startling plainness of speech, the strength of the tendencies which John Byron transmitted to his son. The following extract contains the father's only allusion to the boy:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|What {{was wrong}} with me just then, what I had sallied out in hope to be {{delivered}} from, was the unhappy conviction that my life was worthless, and I of no use in the world. I had taught myself to make knots in strings, but actual experience seemed to have proved that most human fumblings resulted only in [...] "grannies" [...] {{and not in the}} true lover's variety. They secured nothing, only tangled and jammed. I was young then, and yet as heavily burdened with other people's responsibilities as was poor Christian with the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sins. But my bundle, too, in that lovely, desolate loneliness at last fell off my shoulders.|$|E
6000|$|The poetry he recited me {{was full}} of his nature and his visions. Sometimes it told of other lives he {{believes}} himself to have lived in other centuries, sometimes of people he had talked to, revealing them to their own minds. I told him I would write an article upon him and it, and was told in turn that I might do so if I did not mention his name, for he wished to be always [...] "unknown, obscure, impersonal." [...] Next day a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> poems arrived, and with them a note in these words: [...] "Here are copies of verses you said you liked. I do not think I could ever write or paint any more. I prepare myself for a cycle of other activities in some other life. I will make rigid my roots and branches. It is not now my turn to burst into leaves and flowers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't it horrible?" [...] she cried, as he entered, {{carrying}} a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> papers under <b>his</b> arm. [...] "I {{never have had}} such a shock!" ...|$|R
60|$|Meeting soon {{afterwards}} {{another man}} with a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> weapons on <b>his</b> shoulder, the intrigued Huguenot gentleman asked him bluntly what he carried and whither he went.|$|R
60|$|But the man heeded him not. He {{seized the}} money, and {{disregarding}} the sovereigns that rolled loose upon the floor, thrust the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> notes into <b>his</b> pocket.|$|R
6000|$|This horse Nagger {{appeared}} as unique {{in his class}} as Slone was rare among riders. Nagger seemed of several colors, though black predominated. His coat was shaggy, almost woolly, {{like that of a}} sheep. He was huge, raw-boned, knotty, long of body and long of leg, with the head of a war charger. His build did not suggest speed. There appeared to be something slow and ponderous about him, similar to an elephant, with the same suggestion of power and endurance. [...] Slone discarded the pack-saddle and bags. The latter were almost empty. He roped the tarpaulin {{on the back of the}} mustang, and, making a small <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> few supplies, he tied that to the tarpaulin. His blanket he used for a saddle-blanket on Nagger. Of the utensils left by the Stewarts he chose a couple of small iron pans, with long handles. The rest he left. In his saddle-bags he had a few extra horseshoes, some nails, bullets for his rifle, and a knife with a heavy blade.|$|E
6000|$|Father {{carefully}} {{put down}} the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> new shoes, drew a long breath, then tried to look bored again. Cautiously: [...] "Yes, I've thought some of going back into business. 'Course I'd hate {{to give up my}} exploring and all, but-- Progress, you know; hate to lay down the burden of big affairs after being right in the midst of them for so long." [...] Which was a recollection of some editorial Father had read in a stray roadside newspaper. [...] "And you mustn't suppose I'd be sniffy about Lipsittsville. No, no; no, indeed. Not at all. I must say I don't know when I've seen a more wide-awake, pretty town--and you can imagine how many towns I must have seen. Maples and cement walks and nice houses and--uh--wide-awake town.... Well, who knows! Perhaps some day I might come back here and talk business with you. Ha, ha! Though I wouldn't put in one cent of capital. No, sir! Not one red cent. All my money is invested with my son-in-law--you know, Harris Hartwig, the famous chemical works. Happen to know um?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{observed}} {{that he wore}} a cotton shirt, originally white, a greenish flannel one over it, but no waistcoat, flannel drawers, and strong linen or duck pants, which also had been white, blue woolen stockings, cowhide boots, and a Kossuth hat.[3] He carried no change of clothing, but, putting on a stout, thick jacket, which he laid aside in the canoe, and seizing a full-sized axe, his gun and ammunition, and a blanket, which would do for a sail or knapsack, if wanted, and strapping on his belt, which contained a large sheath-knife, he walked off at once, ready to be gone all summer. This looked very independent--a few simple and effective tools, and no rubber clothing. He was always the first ready to start in the morning. Instead of carrying a large <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own extra clothing, etc., he brought back the greatcoats of moose tied up in his blanket. I found that his outfit {{was the result of}} a long experience, and in the main hardly to be improved on, unless by washing and an extra shirt. Wanting a button here, he walked off to a place where some Indians had recently encamped, and searched for one, but I believe in vain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not; but he brags he's goin' to; an' {{the first}} time he tucks a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> papers under <b>his</b> arm, I'll give him one to remember!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see {{you have}} brought with {{you some of}} their bludgeons," [...] Dick said, {{pointing}} {{to one of the}} watchmen carrying a great <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> sticks over <b>his</b> shoulder.|$|R
