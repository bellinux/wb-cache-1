5|$|Häkkinen set {{the fastest}} lap {{of the race}} on lap two and began to {{maintain}} the gap <b>between</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> Michael Schumacher while both drivers {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field. Villeneuve moved into eighth position when he passed Herbert on lap seven, while Trulli clinched 11th from teammate Frentzen. Verstappen became the first retirement of the race when he coasted across the circuit with gearbox problems on lap nine and drove to his garage. Diniz made his first pit stop on lap 13, starting the first round of pit stops. At the front of the field, Häkkinen increased the gap <b>between</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> Michael Schumacher to two seconds, who in turn was a further ten seconds ahead of Coulthard in third. Ralf Schumacher was a further 8.8 seconds behind the second McLaren driver, but was drawing ahead of Irvine in fifth. Further back, Trulli made a pit stop from tenth on lap 15 and emerged in 18th position. Irvine became the first of the front runners to pit the following lap and emerged behind Frentzen.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Kathmandu, in complicity with Rana Bahadur, Bhimsen indulged in appropriating the palaces and properties of deposed members of Shah family, which he shared <b>between</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> his supporter Rangnath Paudel. This aroused resentment and jealousy among Sher Bahadur Shah (Rana Bahadur's step brother) and his faction, since {{they did not}} receive any portion of this confiscated property, despite their help in reinstating Rana Bahadur to power. They were also wary of Bhimsen's growing power. By this time, Rana Bahadur was a nominal figure and Kaji Bhimsen Thapa was single-handedly controlling the central administration of the country, being able to implement even unpopular reforms like Baisathi Haran.|$|E
5|$|As {{the chief}} aide and closest friend of Emperor Andronikos III, Kantakouzenos became regent for the underage John V upon Andronikos's death in June 1341.

In response, Kantakouzenos' army and supporters proclaimed him co-emperor in October, cementing the rift <b>between</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> the new regency. The split immediately escalated into armed conflict.|$|E
5|$|Chambers' coach Mike McFarlane {{struggled}} with the workload of full-time training. Frustrated by the distance <b>between</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> the top sprinters, Chambers decided to relocate to California to work with Ukrainian coach Remi Korchemny and nutritionist Victor Conte. After parting ways with American sprinter Tim Montgomery, Conte looked to Chambers to fill the athlete's berth. In the run up to the year's major events, Chambers was in fine form and recorded a 200m personal best of 20.27s in Athens on 10 June 2002. Montgomery, impressed by Chambers' training regime, tipped the Briton to win the gold at the forthcoming 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England.|$|E

5|$|Estre {{was issued}} with a drive-through penalty {{after he was}} adjudged to have caused the {{collision}} <b>between</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> Tandy. Tandy stopped his Porsche briefly at the pit lane entry, while Bonanomi went wide driving up to Radallion corner battling Wurz for sixth. The incident involving Hartley handed the No. 17 Porsche a 15-second, stop-and-go penalty as he was deemed not to have respected track limits and causing danger to marshals. Bernhard took the penalty on the 17th lap, promoting teammate Jani to the lead. Evans moved {{to the front of}} the LMP2 field after overtaking Canal heading into the Bus Stop chicane. Fässler ceded third position to Duval at Les Combes corner.|$|E
5|$|Häkkinen {{started the}} race {{alongside}} Michael Schumacher {{on the front}} row of the grid. Michael Schumacher attempted to defend his lead off the line by moving into Häkkinen's path, but Häkkinen passed Michael Schumacher heading into the first corner, with Coulthard withstanding Williams driver Ralf Schumacher attempts to pass him to maintain third position. Michael Schumacher managed to close the gap to his title rival by lap 31 and passed Häkkinen during the second round of pit stops. This allowed him to maintain a 1.9-second gap <b>between</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> Häkkinen {{towards the end of the}} race to secure his eighth victory of the season.|$|E
5|$|In 1837 Bennett {{began to}} teach at the RAM, with which he was {{associated}} {{for most of the}} rest of his life. For twenty years he taught there, later also teaching at Queen's College, London. Amongst his pupils during this period were Arthur Sullivan, Hubert Parry, and Tobias Matthay. Throughout the 1840s and 1850s he composed little, although he performed as a pianist and directed the Philharmonic Society for ten years. He also actively promoted concerts of chamber music. From 1848 onwards his career was punctuated by antagonism <b>between</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> the conductor Michael Costa.|$|E

5|$|In 1896, Borah joined many Idahoans, {{including}} Senator Fred Dubois, in bolting the Republican Party {{to support}} the presidential campaign of Democrat William Jennings Bryan — free silver, which Bryan advocated, was extremely popular in Idaho. Borah thus became a Silver Republican {{in opposition to the}} campaign of the Republican presidential candidate, former Ohio governor William McKinley. Borah ran for the House of Representatives that year, but knew that with the silver vote split <b>between</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> a Democrat-Populist fusion candidate, he had little chance of winning, and concentrated on making speeches aimed at gaining a legislature that would re-elect Dubois — until 1913, state legislatures elected senators. Bryan, Dubois, and Borah were all defeated.|$|E
5|$|In 216 Caracalla {{pursued a}} series of {{aggressive}} campaigns in the east against the Parthians, intended to bring more territory under direct Roman control. He offered the king of Parthia, Artabanus V of Parthia, a marriage proposal <b>between</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> the king's daughter. Artabanus refused the offer, realizing that the proposal was merely an attempt to unite the kingdom of Parthia {{under the control of}} Rome. In response, Caracalla used the opportunity to start a campaign against the Parthians. That summer Caracalla began to attack the countryside east of the Tigris in the Parthian war of Caracalla. In the following winter, Caracalla retired to Edessa, modern Şanlıurfa in south-east Turkey, and began making preparations to renew the campaign by spring.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the studies of Arguedas and Flaubert, Vargas Llosa has written literary criticisms of other authors that he has admired, such as Gabriel García Márquez, Albert Camus, Ernest Hemingway, and Jean-Paul Sartre. The main goals of his non-fiction works are to acknowledge the influence of these authors on his writing, and to recognize a connection <b>between</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> the other writers; critic Sara Castro-Klarén argues that he offers little systematic analysis of these authors' literary techniques. In The Perpetual Orgy, for example, he discusses the relationship between his own aesthetics and Flaubert's, {{rather than focusing on}} Flaubert's alone.|$|E

5|$|In the Senate, Nixon took a {{prominent}} position in opposing global communism, traveling frequently and {{speaking out against}} it. He maintained friendly relations with his fellow anti-communist, the controversial Wisconsin senator, Joseph McCarthy, but was careful to keep some distance <b>between</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> McCarthy's allegations. Nixon also criticized President Harry S. Truman's handling of the Korean War. He supported statehood for Alaska and Hawaii, {{voted in favor of}} civil rights for minorities, and supported federal disaster relief for India and Yugoslavia. He voted against price controls and other monetary restrictions, benefits for illegal immigrants, and public power.|$|E
5|$|Montoya {{maintained}} his start-line advantage and led {{until he was}} passed by Barrichello on the ninth lap. Barrichello pulled away from Montoya and held the lead until his one and only pit stop on lap 19 which proved problematic because of a faulty refuelling rig. Montoya was utilising a one-stop strategy and made a pit stop on lap 29, which allowed his teammate Ralf Schumacher to lead for six laps. Barrichello regained the lead on lap 36, until Montoya took over the position on lap 42 when Barrichello made a pit stop for the second time. Barrichello started to reduce the gap <b>between</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> Montoya {{but was unable to}} challenge the Williams driver who won his first Formula One victory.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Strauss {{works that}} are {{performed}} today may once have existed {{in a slightly}} different form, as Eduard Strauss destroyed much of the original Strauss orchestral archives in a furnace factory in Vienna's Mariahilf district in 1907. Eduard, then the only surviving brother of the three, took this drastic precaution after agreeing to a pact <b>between</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> brother Josef that whoever outlived the other was to destroy their works. The measure was intended to prevent the Strauss family's works from being claimed by another composer. This may also have been fueled by Strauss's rivalry with another of Vienna's popular waltz and march composers, Karl Michael Ziehrer.|$|E
