50|$|The basic sidemount {{configuration}} requires different {{techniques for}} sharing gas, {{compared to the}} isolation manifolded twins <b>back</b> <b>mount</b> configuration.

50|$|The RB80 {{is usually}} carried between {{a set of}} <b>back</b> <b>mounted</b> {{isolation}} manifolded double cylinders, supported on a backplate and wing harness. Dives in shallow open water could be done using a small single tank mounted {{to one side of}} the RB80.It can also be side-mounted for tight restrictions. Occasionally extreme dive profiles require the use of a rebreather for bailout, and the RB80 can be carried as a <b>back</b> <b>mounted</b> pair, as one <b>back</b> <b>mount</b> and one side mount, or both side mounted for those occasions.|$|R

Her house is on the European plan: a table in the midst of the chief room; photographs and religious pictures on the wall.

Here, in the strong thorough-draught, Her Majesty received us in a simple gown of print, and with no mark of royalty but the exquisite finish of her tattooed mittens, the elaboration of her manners, and the gentle falsetto in which all the highly refined among Marquesan ladies (and Vaekehu above all others) delight to sing their language. An adopted daughter interpreted, while we gave the news, and rehearsed by name our friends of Anaho. As we talked, we could see, through the landward door, another lady of the household at her toilet under the green trees; who presently, when her hair was arranged, and her hat wreathed with flowers, appeared upon the back verandah with gracious salutations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the theoretical framework, the experimental {{background and the}} software implementation of the computer package JointCalc for the strength analysis and design of adhesively bonded joints. Developed by Henkel AG in collaboration with three Italian Universities, JointCalc {{was designed to be}} accessible to non-experts, intuitive for occasional users and also general enough to include most of the joint configurations encountered in practice. For the calculation of adhesive stresses, JointCalc implements the analytical elastic solutions available in the literature for the fundamental joint geometries (single and double-lap joints, single and double-strap joints, peel joints and cylindrical joints). A key aspect of JointCalc is the experimental failure criterion adopted, represented by an admissible region in the peel-shear stress plane. The implementation required the creation of an experimental database, specifically built for the set of 14 adhesives (mostly epoxies) considered. A distinguished asset of JointCalc is its intuitive graphical interface that enables the user to choose the desired joint configuration, input the data and examine the results in a straightforward way. Since its appearance in 2003, JointCalc has been applied to the design of bonded assemblies covering a wide spectrum of industrial applications. Three of those applications (a seat <b>back</b> <b>mounting,</b> a shear punch solenoid and a screening device) are presented {{at the end of the}} paper as case studies. The disclosed data show that, provided that thoughtful engineering judgement is applied to idealize the real joints, JointCalc strength predictions closely match the experimental findings...|$|E

40|$|To {{establish}} the capability for measurement of oscillatory pressure on rotating blades, miniature fast response semiconductor strain gage pressure transducers (2 mm x 0. 33 mm) were mounted in several configurations on thin titanium and steel compressor blades {{and subjected to}} pressure cycles from 1 to 310 kPa during static tests and spin tests. Static test conditions included 20 C to 150 C, 0 to 3000 tensile microstrain, - 1000 to + 1000 bending microstrain and + or - 650 G vibration. The spin test conditions included 20 C to 82 C at 0 to 90, 000 G. Durability was excellent. Pressure transducer sensitivity changed by only a few percent over this range of environmental conditions. Noise signal due to oscillatory acceleration normal to the diaphragm was acceptable (0. 33 Pa/G). Noise signal due to oscillatory strain was acceptable (0. 5 Pa/microstrain) when the transducer was mounted on a 0. 05 mm rubber pad, with a total buildup of 0. 38 mm on the measure surface. <b>Back</b> <b>mounting</b> or partial recessing to eliminate buildup, increased the strain effect to 1. 2 Pa/microstrain. Flush mounting within the blade to eliminate buildup reduced the strain effect, but required development of a special transducer shape. This transducer was not available in time for spin tests. Unpredictable zero drift + or - 14 kPa ruled out {{the use of these}} mounting arrangements for accurate steady-state (D. C.) measurements on rotating blades. The two best configurations fully developed and spin tested were then successfully applied in the NAS 3 - 20606 rotating fan flutter program for quantitative measurement of oscillatory pressure amplitudes...|$|E

25|$|<b>Back</b> <b>mount</b> is {{the system}} where one or more {{cylinders}} are firmly attached to a harness, usually with a buoyancy compensator jacket or wing, and carried on the diver's <b>back.</b> <b>Back</b> <b>mount</b> allows cylinders to be manifolded together as twins, or for special circumstances, trips or quads. It is a high profile arrangement and may be unsuited to some sites where the diver needs to pass through low openings. This is the standard configuration for single or twin cylinder recreational diving, and for much technical diving in open water.|$|R

50|$|<b>Back</b> <b>mount,</b> or rear mount, is a {{dominant}} grappling position where the practitioner is behind his opponent {{in such a}} way that he has control of his opponent. Ideally, the opponent will be recumbent (prone), while the practitioner centers his weight atop the opponent, either in a seated or recumbent posture. Many consider <b>back</b> <b>mount</b> to be a very dominant, perhaps even the most advantageous position in grappling. This is due to the practitioner being able to attack with strikes and submissions with the opponent having a severely limited ability to see incoming attacks and defend against them.|$|R
5000|$|Some are <b>back</b> <b>mounted.</b> Some {{are worn}} on the chest. Some {{have a hard}} casing. If used underwater, the counterlung must be near the user's lungs. The use {{duration}} on a fill varies widely with make.|$|R
50|$|A {{variation}} on the <b>back</b> <b>mounted</b> buoyancy compensator is used without a backplate for side mount diving This arrangement is functionally similar to wearing the buoyancy compensator sandwiched between the cylinder(s) and backplate, {{but there is no}} backplate or <b>back</b> <b>mounted</b> cylinder. The buoyancy cell may be mounted between the sidemount harness and the diver, or on top of the harness. The sides of the bladder may be restrained from floating upwards when inflated by bungee cords clipped to the waistband in front of the diver or clipped to each other, forming an elastic belt across the front of the hips, well below the diaphragm.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} prevent the {{opponent}} from escaping the <b>back</b> <b>mount,</b> the position must have stability. This is generally accomplished by utilizing the practitioner’s own legs to hook {{the inside of the}} opponent's thighs, (commonly called hooks) while holding the opponent's neck or arms to maintain chest-to-back contact. Such a position can be very difficult to escape. The opponent may attempt to roll, but the hooks and chest-to-back contact will allow the practitioner to roll with the opponent. The practitioner that has the <b>back</b> <b>mount</b> is in a very advantageous position. He can strike with punches, elbows and headbutts, or alternatively attempt a rear naked choke, various collar-chokes as well as armlocks.|$|R
50|$|A {{prototype}} rebreather {{was built}} in 1849 by Pierre Aimable De Saint Simon Sicard, and in 1853 by Professor T. Schwann in Belgium.

50|$|The wrestler sits {{on top of}} the {{opponent}}'s torso, facing their head, {{with his}} legs on either side.

5000|$|One of the {{advantages}} of the sidemount system is the easy access to cylinder valves, and the protected position they occupy in comparison with most <b>back</b> <b>mount</b> systems, where the valves are relatively vulnerable to bumping against an overhead and being [...] "rolled off" [...] (closed by rubbing against the overhead).|$|R
500|$|Main {{cylinder}} plus a small independent cylinder: this configuration uses a larger, <b>back</b> <b>mounted</b> {{main cylinder}} {{along with an}} independent smaller cylinder, often called a [...] "pony" [...] or [...] "bailout cylinder".
