2500|$|When the 2011 Egyptian protests began, Clinton {{was in the}} {{forefront}} of the administration's response. Her initial public assessment on January 25 that the government of President Hosni Mubarak was [...] "stable" [...] and [...] "looking for ways to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people" [...] soon came under criticism for being tepid and <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> of developing events, although others agreed that the U.S. could not be out front in undermining the government of a long-term ally. By the next day, Clinton was criticizing the Egyptian government's blocking of social media sites. By January 29, Obama had put Clinton in charge of sorting out the administration's so-far confused response to developments. During the frenetic day of January 30, she combined appearances on all five Sunday morning talk shows – where she stated publicly {{for the first time the}} U.S.'s view that there needed to be an [...] "orderly transition" [...] to a [...] "democratic participatory government" [...] and a [...] "peaceful transition to real democracy", not Mubarak's [...] "faux democracy" [...] – with a flight to Haiti and back to mark the anniversary of its terrible earthquake, all the while engaging in conference calls again regarding Egypt.|$|E

50|$|The {{interiors}} {{of the buildings}} have been completely rebuilt. After the Second World War, Park Crescent was in poor condition (as were other Nash terraces near Regent's Park). The Gorell Report {{on the future of}} the Regent’s Park terraces recommended that the facades of Park Crescent should be saved. They were restored in the 1960s when the leases came up for renewal, and they are protected as grade I listed buildings, but <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> of the Crescent, the Crown Estate built new structures. Interior features which are visible from the street, such as light fittings, have to respect the Regency design of the facade.|$|E
50|$|According to the Aberdeen Group, a {{large number}} of {{companies}} are rapidly undertaking mobile BI owing to {{a large number}} of market pressures such as the need for higher efficiency in business processes, improvement in employee productivity (e.g., time spent looking for information), better and faster decision making, better customer service, and delivery of real-time bi-directional data access to make decisions anytime and anywhere. But despite the apparent advantages of mobile information delivery, mobile BI is still in the ‘early adopter’ phase. Some CFOs remain sceptical of the business benefits and with the perceived lack of specific business use cases and tangible ROI, mobile BI adoption is still <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> compared with other enterprise mobile applications.|$|E

50|$|Like other {{financial}} products, strategies that involve trading strategy indices have burnt {{the fingers of}} many a pension fund and small bank. The simplest argument against these strategies would be this: If the strategy {{is expected to be}} very profitable, the only eyes that it would catch would be the proprietary desks of these investment banks. For example, the fed funds curve strategy actually ends up being <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> as it takes action based on what the fed has already done - this implies that the steepening has already occurred.However, such argument can hold true for everything a bank is willing to trade. A more serious issue is the danger that past backtested performance is simply the result of data-snooping - especially when signals are plentiful and difficult to justify on economic grounds (e.g. moving averages crossing signals).|$|E
50|$|We've just {{failed at}} it. It's not been {{something}} we've successfully done. At Star Trek {{we used to}} have all these stock answers for why we didn't do it. The truth is it was not really a priority for any of us on the staff so it wasn't really something that was strong on anybody's radar. And then I think there's a certain inertia that you're not used to writing those characters into these dramas and then you just don't. And somebody has to decide that it's important before you do it and I think we're still at the place where that's not yet a common - yeah, we have to include this and this is an important thing to include in the shows. Sci fi for whatever reason is just sort of <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> on all this.|$|E
5000|$|Archbishop Brown {{acknowledged}} {{that he has a}} good line of communication with Pope Benedict, saying: “I know him, he knows me. I worked with him closely for 10 years, I travelled with him, I worked hard for him. He trusts me, for better or for worse". He added that [...] "I have not seen anything yet. I have a steep mountain to climb and I hope to be there helping. As for reforms to the Irish church, I am agnostic about this. I need to study all that material and then talk to the Irish bishops". He concluded that [...] "The church was left <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> on all of that, the church has to modernise and to find new ways of presenting her message to people in this new context of the materialism and consumerism of a society that is now more similar to other European countries {{than it was in the}} 1980s".|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to clarify the sound source regions of the aerodynamic sounds generated by the bent round bars. In the experiment, the coherence between the aeolian sound and the velocity fluctuation of <b>the</b> wake <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> bent round bar is examined and the wake region with a strong correlation is obtained by calculating the band overall value of C. O. P. (Coherent output power) which is the product of the coherence and the power spectrum of the velocity fluctuation. The experimental results show that this method is possible to clarify a sound source region generated by a speaker located in the air flow. And it shows that the large band overall values of C. O. P. are distributed in <b>the</b> wake region <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curved</b> part and that this region can be regarded as the source of aeolian sound...|$|R

5000|$|After a Getzein {{victory over}} the Kansas City Cowboys in 1886, the Detroit Free Press wrote: [...] "The Pretzel is all right. He went into the box to-day and pitched one of his finest, his curves {{circling}} around {{in the form of}} the delicious pastry from which Getz takes his sobriquet." [...] However, the editor of the Grand Rapids World opined that Getzein's [...] "curved ball" [...] was a fiction. He wrote:"The baseball enthusiasts claim for Getzein that he is able to so pitch a ball that it will describe the arc of a circle on a horizontal plane before reaching the catcher, and that therein lies the secret of his marvelous pitching [...] [...] [...] Scientifically, this theory is utterly absurd. The forces that act upon a ball pitched by Getzein are not different from those which operate upon a projectile thrown from any other source, and the results must be the same, and governed by the same laws. The curves are in the imagination of Getzein's admirers. When the ball leaves his hand it is beyond his control, and it moves forward from the impulse last given it as it leaves his hand. It is then controlled by the force of propulsion, the resistance of the atmosphere, and gravitation[...] [...] [...] Getzein's antic and deceptive motions may deceive the batter, so that he is unable to discover the exact course of the ball in time to strike it, but he cannot throw a ball so as to make a curve on the horizontal plane."The Scientific American magazine responded in July 1886 by publishing an article written by Henry Chadwick (accompanied by several diagrams, two of which are reproduced above) explaining the physics <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> ball pitch.|$|E
5000|$|Several present related {{what they}} saw. Unidentified speaker 1: Suddenly, they turned around, got on their knees, {{as if they}} were ordered to, they did it all together, aimed. And personally, I was {{standing}} there saying, they're not going to shoot, they can't do that. If they are going to shoot, it's going to be blank. [...] Unidentified speaker 2: The shots were definitely coming my way, because when a bullet passes your head, it makes a crack. I hit the ground <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> looking over. I saw a student hit. He stumbled and fell, to where he was running towards the car. Another student tried to pull him behind the car, bullets were coming through the windows of the car.As this student fell behind the car, I saw another student go down, next to the curb, {{on the far side of}} the automobile, maybe 25 or 30 yards from where I was lying. It was maybe 25, 30, 35 seconds of sporadic firing.The firing stopped. I lay there maybe 10 or 15 seconds. I got up, I saw four or five students lying around the lot. By this time, it was like mass hysteria. Students were crying, they were screaming for ambulances. I heard some girl screaming, [...] "They didn't have blank, they didn't have blank," [...] no, they didn't. Another witness was Chrissie Hynde, the future lead singer of The Pretenders and a student at Kent State University at the time. In her 2015 autobiography she described what she saw: Then I heard the tatatatatatatatatat sound. I thought it was fireworks. An eerie sound fell over the common. The quiet felt like gravity pulling us to the ground. Then a young man's voice: [...] "They fucking killed somebody!" [...] Everything slowed down and the silence got heavier.The ROTC building, now nothing more than a few inches of charcoal, was surrounded by National Guardsmen. They were all on one knee and pointing their rifles at...us! Then they fired.By the time I made my way to where I could see them it was still unclear what was going on. The guardsmen themselves looked stunned. We looked at them and they looked at us. They were just kids, 19 years old, like us. But in uniform. Like our boys in Vietnam.|$|E

Convex guardrails can typically be found at intersections or {{in the middle of}} roundabouts. <b>The</b> <b>curved</b> convex guardrail was, as expected, more yielding than the same straight one. Although yielding is a desirable function while thinking impact crash safety, in the hereby shown cases the risk of secondary impact to objects in <b>the</b> area <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curved</b> guardrail can not be neglected. Measured accelerations are low. It is important for the function that <b>the</b> soil surface <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> guardrail is more or less in level with the carriageway. In the tested configuration, the angled bars connecting the guardrail to ground seems important for good function during impact. The overall result can be summarized as curved guardrails yield more than straight ones, they take advantage of a large are, which must be kept free from hazardous objects, the rod is essential for the function and we did not record any specific hazardous knees on the cross member...|$|R
