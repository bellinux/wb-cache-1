25|$|High-intensity {{discharge}} lamps (HID) produce light {{with an electric}} arc rather than a glowing filament. The high intensity of the arc comes from metallic salts that are vaporized within the arc chamber. These lamps are formally known as gas-discharge burners, and have a higher efficacy than tungsten lamps. Because of the increased amounts of light available from HID burners relative to halogen bulbs, HID headlamps producing a given <b>beam</b> <b>pattern</b> can be made smaller than halogen headlamps producing a comparable <b>beam</b> <b>pattern.</b> Alternatively, the larger size can be retained, {{in which case the}} xenon headlamp can produce a more robust <b>beam</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|E
25|$|Glare-free {{high beam}} is a camera-driven dynamic {{lighting}} control strategy that selectively shades spots and slices {{out of the}} high <b>beam</b> <b>pattern</b> to protect other road users from glare, while always providing the driver with maximum seeing range. The area surrounding other road users is constantly illuminated at high beam intensity, but without the glare that would result from using uncontrolled high beams in traffic. This constantly changing <b>beam</b> <b>pattern</b> requires complex sensors, microprocessors and actuators, because the vehicles which must be shadowed out of the beam are constantly moving. The dynamic shadowing can be achieved with movable shadow masks shifted within the light path inside the headlamp. Or, the effect {{can be achieved by}} selectively darkening addressable LED emitters or reflector elements, a technique known as 'Pixel light'.|$|E

In 1992, US regulations were amended to {{permit the use of}} H4 bulbs redesignated HB2 and 9003, and with slightly different production tolerances stipulated. These are physically and electrically interchangeable with H4 bulbs. Similar optical techniques are used, but with different reflector or lens optics to create a US <b>beam</b> <b>pattern</b> rather than a European one.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this study, a {{dual-band}} pattern reconfigurable antenna {{is proposed}} for 2. 4 and 5. 8 GHz wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) applications. The proposed antenna comprises four pairs of active elements and parasitic elements loaded on PIN diodes. By switching PIN diodes, the parasitic element {{acts as a}} director or reflector, and the radiation patterns of the antenna are optimized. The antenna offers three modes with nine radiation <b>beam</b> <b>patterns</b> in a 5. 8 GHz band. The measured peak gain of all the <b>beam</b> <b>patterns</b> ranges from 5. 6 to 10. 4 dBi.

25|$|There are two {{different}} <b>beam</b> <b>pattern</b> and headlamp construction standards in use in the world: The ECE standard, which is allowed or required in virtually all industrialized countries except the United States, and the SAE standard that is mandatory only in the US. Japan formerly had bespoke lighting regulations similar to the US standards, but for {{the left side of}} the road. However, Japan now adheres to the ECE standard. The differences between the SAE and ECE headlamp standards are primarily in the amount of glare permitted toward other drivers on low beam (SAE permits much more glare), the minimum amount of light required to be thrown straight down the road (SAE requires more), and the specific locations within the beam at which minimum and maximum light levels are specified.|$|E
25|$|The skyway and YBITS {{structures}} have custom lighting using 48,000 high-performance LEDs grouped in 1521 fixtures, most {{of which}} are mounted on 273 poles. These fixtures were designed by Moffatt & Nichol and built by Valmont Industries. Within a specific fixture the <b>beam</b> <b>pattern</b> of each LED is restricted by a masking structure. Each fixture has been adjusted independently and with the LED masking will illuminate the roadways only in the direction of travel, similar to the vehicles' headlights and therefore greatly reducing glare presented to drivers. This is expected to improve safety for travelers. The main span roadways are illuminated by downward-pointing LED fixtures mounted upon the main cable suspender saddles. Additional upward-facing decorative lighting at the extreme outboard edges of the roadways illuminate the suspender cables and the underside of the main cable. Additional lights highlight the main tower.|$|E

2500|$|As the sinc-like {{characteristics}} of a compressed pulse are due to the near-rectangular profile of its spectrum, then by modifying that characteristic into a bell shape, for example, {{it is possible to}} reduce the sidelobe levels considerably. [...] Previous work for antenna arrays and digital signal processing has already addressed this same problem. [...] So, for example, in the case of antennas, the spatial sidelobes on the <b>beam</b> <b>pattern</b> are improved by applying a weighting function to the array elements, {{and in the case of}} digital signal processing, window functions are used to reduce the amplitude of unwanted sidelobes on the sampled functions.|$|E

2500|$|One {{filament}} {{is located}} at {{the focal point of the}} reflector. The other filament is shifted axially and radially away from the focal point. In most 2-filament sealed beams and in 2-filament replaceable bulbs of type 9004, 9007, and H13, the high-beam filament is at the focal point and the low-beam filament is off focus. For use in right-traffic countries, the low-beam filament is positioned slightly upward, forward and leftward of the focal point, so that when it is energized, the beam is widened and shifted slightly downward and rightward of the headlamp axis. Transverse-filament bulbs such as the 9004 can only be used with the filaments horizontal, but axial-filament bulbs can be rotated or [...] "clocked" [...] by the headlamp designer to optimize the <b>beam</b> <b>pattern</b> or to effect the traffic-handedness of the low beam. The latter is accomplished by clocking the low-beam filament in an upward-forward-leftward position to produce a right-traffic low beam, or in an upward-forward-rightward position to produce a left-traffic low beam.|$|E

2500|$|The {{traditional}} European {{method of}} achieving {{low and high}} beam from a single bulb involves two filaments along the axis of the reflector. The high beam filament is on the focal point, while the low beam filament is approximately 1cm forward of the focal point and 3mm above the axis. Below the low beam filament is a cup-shaped shield (called a [...] "Graves Shield") spanning an arc of 165°. When the low beam filament is illuminated, this shield casts a shadow on the corresponding lower area of the reflector, blocking downward light rays that would otherwise strike the reflector and be cast above the horizon. The bulb is rotated (or [...] "clocked") within the headlamp to position the Graves Shield so as to allow light to strike a 15° wedge of {{the lower half of}} the reflector. This is used to create the upsweep or upstep characteristic of ECE low beam light distributions. The bulb's rotative position within the reflector depends on the type of <b>beam</b> <b>pattern</b> to be produced and the traffic directionality of the market for which the headlamp is intended.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} US Navy scanning sonar {{at the end}} of the World War II operated at 18kHz, {{using an}} array of ADP crystals. Desired longer range, however, required use of lower frequencies. The required dimensions were too big for ADP crystals, so in the early 1950s magnetostrictive and barium titanate piezoelectric systems were developed, but these had problems achieving uniform impedance characteristics, and the <b>beam</b> <b>pattern</b> suffered. Barium titanate was then replaced with more stable lead zirconate titanate (PZT), and the frequency was lowered to 5kHz. The US fleet used this material in the AN/SQS-23 sonar for several decades. The SQS-23 sonar first used magnetostrictive nickel transducers, but these weighed several tons, and nickel was expensive and considered a critical material; piezoelectric transducers were therefore substituted. The sonar was a large array of 432 individual transducers. At first, the transducers were unreliable, showing mechanical and electrical failures and deteriorating soon after installation; they were also produced by several vendors, had different designs, and their characteristics were different enough to impair the array's performance. The policy to allow repair of individual transducers was then sacrificed, and [...] "expendable modular design", sealed non-repairable modules, was chosen instead, eliminating the problem with seals and other extraneous mechanical parts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Simultaneous {{observations}} of AKR emission using the four-spacecraft Cluster array {{were used to}} make the first direct measurements of the angular <b>beaming</b> <b>patterns</b> of individual bursts. By comparing the spacecraft locations and AKR burst locations, the angular <b>beaming</b> <b>pattern</b> was found to be narrowly confined to a plane containing the magnetic field vector at the source and tangent to a circle of constant latitude. Most rays paths are confined within 15 ◦ of this tangent plane, consistent with numerical simulations of AKR k-vector orientation at maximum growth rate. The emission is also strongly directed upward in the tangent plane, which we interpret as refraction of the rays as they leave the auroral cavity. The narrow <b>beaming</b> <b>pattern</b> implies that an observer located above the polar cap can detect AKR emission only from {{a small fraction of the}} auroral oval at a given location. This has important consequences for interpreting AKR visibility at a given location. It also helps re-interpret previously published Cluster VLBI studies of AKR source locations, which are now seen to be only a subset of all possible source locations. 1...|$|R

By comparing the phase difference of the same echo in the inner and outer beams, the angle off-axis can be estimated. In a further refinement of this concept, a split-beam echosounder divides the transducer face into four quadrants, allowing the location of targets in three dimensions. Single-frequency, split-beam echosounders are now the standard instrument of fisheries acoustics.|$|E

It would be preferable to constrain the range of values that the transmission coefficient can take {{as an integral part of}} the lens synthesis procedure, and thus the transmission coefficient itself needs to be the synthesis variable. In this thesis a synthesis technique for doing this is developed based on the method of generalized projections, modified to “operate” in the space of transmission coefficients. This makes it possible to immediately perceive what influence constraints on the actual transmission coefficients have on the possible radiation pattern performance. In addition, an approach that allows one to constrain the transmission coefficient to values that must be selected from an available database of transmission coefficients is incorporated into the synthesis technique...|$|R
