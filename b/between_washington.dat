5|$|The Red Line is {{the only}} line in the system that does not share its tracks with another Metrorail line. The Amtrak and MARC tracks do, however, run {{parallel}} to the Red Line tracks <b>between</b> <b>Washington</b> Union Station and Silver Spring {{as well as between}} Twinbrook and Shady Grove stations. These tracks used {{to be part of the}} former Batimore & Ohio Railroad route. MARC uses this parallel route when traveling <b>between</b> <b>Washington</b> and Martinsburg, West Virginia. Amtrak, on the other hand, uses this parallel route when traveling the Capitol Limited route <b>between</b> <b>Washington</b> and Chicago Union Station. Although MARC does stop at the Silver Spring and Rockville stations <b>between</b> <b>Washington</b> and West Virginia, Amtrak only stops at Rockville <b>between</b> <b>Washington</b> and Chicago.|$|E

5|$|As a senator, Nixon {{received}} an annual salary of $12,500 (about $150,000 in 2009 dollars). While he {{received an}} expense allowance of over $75,000, more than most senators received (because California {{was one of the}} most populous states), that money went to pay his staff of 12 and to cover the cost of stationery, telephone service, telegrams, and other office expenses. It also paid for the one set of round-trip airline tickets <b>between</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., and California that Nixon was allowed to buy for himself and his family at taxpayer expense each Congressional session.|$|E
5|$|Continuing northward in Montevideo, {{the highway}} {{turns back to}} the east between J. Harley Smith and Lagoon parks.

The avenue passes the hospital before leaving town. The street name attached to the highway in rural Chippewa County is 50th Street as MN7 runs due east through farm country. The highway crosses another line of the BNSF Railway and MN23 in Clara City before meandering southwesterly to follow 60th Street near Bunde. East of this unincorporated community, the highway crosses into Kandiyohi County. The highway follows 195th Avenue through {{the southern part of the}} county, passing through the communities of Prinsburg and Lake Lillian.

5|$|Discharging {{most of the}} {{remaining}} escort, Breckinridge left Washington with a small party on May 5, hoping to distract federal forces from the fleeing Confederate president. <b>Between</b> <b>Washington</b> and Woodstock, the party was overtaken by Union forces under Lieutenant Colonel Andrew K. Campbell; Breckinridge ordered his nephew to surrender while he, his sons Cabell and Clifton, James B. Clay, Jr., and a few others fled into the nearby woods. At Sandersville, he sent Clay and Clifton home, announcing that he {{and the rest of his}} companions would proceed to Madison, Florida. On May 11, they reached Milltown, Georgia, where Breckinridge expected to rendezvous with Davis, but on May 14, he learned of Davis's capture days earlier.|$|E
5|$|During the {{campaign}} Shelby's political enemies, notably Humphrey Marshall, criticized {{his response to}} Jefferson's second letter regarding the Genêt affair and questioned his loyalty to the United States. Shelby contended that his noncommittal response to the letter was meant to draw the federal government's attention {{to the situation in}} the west. He cited the agreement <b>between</b> <b>Washington</b> and the Spanish as evidence that his ploy had worked. He also claimed to have known at the time he wrote the letter that the French scheme was destined to fail.|$|E
5|$|In 1792, {{with their}} {{relationship}} completely ruptured, Jefferson unsuccessfully {{tried to convince}} Washington to remove Hamilton, but Washington largely supported Hamilton's ideas, believing that they had led to social and economic stability. Dissonance over Hamilton's proposals also irrevocably broke the relationship <b>between</b> <b>Washington</b> and Madison, who had served as the president's foremost congressional ally {{during the first year}} of his presidency. Opponents of Hamilton and the administration won several seats in the 1792 Congressional elections, and Hamilton was unable to win Congressional approval of his ambitious economic proposals afterward.|$|E

5|$|In early 1996, a {{few months}} after his {{credentials}} had been accepted, Carney met with senior Sudanese foreign ministry officials prior to vacating the U.S. embassy in Khartoum for the safer environs of Nairobi. He proposed tangible steps to recover the rapidly deteriorating relationship <b>between</b> <b>Washington</b> and Khartoum. In March 1996, El Fatih Erwa, then minister of state for defense, was authorized by President Omar al-Bashir to make several secret trips to the United States to hold talks with U.S. officials, including Carney and senior C.I.A. Africa experts, about U.S. sanctions policy against Sudan and what measures might be taken by the Bashir regime to lift them.|$|E
5|$|Inside Man is a 2006 American crime thriller film {{directed}} by Spike Lee, and written by Russell Gewirtz. The film centers on an elaborate bank heist on Wall Street over a 24-hour period. It stars Denzel Washington as Detective Keith Frazier, the NYPD's hostage negotiator; Clive Owen as Dalton Russell, the mastermind who orchestrates the heist; and Jodie Foster as Madeleine White, a Manhattan power broker who becomes involved {{at the request}} of the bank's founder, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), to keep something in his own personal safe deposit box protected from the robbers. Inside Man marks the fourth film collaboration <b>between</b> <b>Washington</b> and Lee.|$|E
5|$|None of the Amclubs {{remain in}} their {{original}} configuration. Three of the original club cars were delivered with all club-style seating {{for a total of}} 33 seats; five of the original style were rebuilt to match. As the original Budd Metroliners were withdrawn many of the Amclubs were refurbished for use in Metroliner service. Three were rebuilt for use on the Montrealer, an overnight train <b>between</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. and Montreal. Booths and lounge seating replaced the coach seating and club seats. These were later rebuilt as all-table dinettes. Most clubs were rebuilt as club-dinette cars, with one half given over to booths and the other having 2×1 seating. Others were rebuilt as full-length business class cars, with 62 seats. Still others were converted to 72-seat coaches.|$|E

5|$|The first chess match by {{electric}} telegraph {{took place in}} 1844, <b>between</b> <b>Washington</b> and Baltimore. In April 1845 Staunton and Captain Kennedy travelled to Gosport to play two games by telegraph against a group in London. Staunton took a long-term interest in this solution to the difficulties of travel, and reported telegraph games in The Illustrated London News. In 1871 his report of a telegraphic match between Sydney and Adelaide calculated that the 74 moves of the longest game had travelled a total of 220,000miles (not {{much less than the}} distance between Earth and Moon).|$|E
5|$|During the Mexican oil boom, Air France flew Concorde twice weekly to Mexico City's Benito Juárez International Airport via Washington, DC, or New York City, from September 1978 to November 1982. The {{worldwide}} {{economic crisis}} {{during that period}} resulted in this route's cancellation; the last flights were almost empty. The routing <b>between</b> <b>Washington</b> or New York and Mexico City included a deceleration, from Mach 2.02 to Mach 0.95, to cross Florida subsonically and avoid creating a sonic boom over the state; Concorde then re-accelerated back to high speed while crossing the Gulf of Mexico. On 1 April 1989, on an around-the-world luxury tour charter, British Airways implemented changes to this routing that allowed G-BOAF to maintain Mach 2.02 by passing around Florida {{to the east and}} south. Periodically Concorde visited the region on similar chartered flights to Mexico City and Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|MD 704 {{follows the}} {{abandoned}} {{right of way}} of the defunct WB Railway, an interurban railroad that included a northsouth line <b>between</b> <b>Washington</b> and Baltimore and a branch to Annapolis from Naval Academy Junction in Odenton. Construction on the electric railway began in 1902 and service began between the three cities in 1908. The WB went into receivership in 1931 and shut down in 1935. The Maryland State Roads Commission converted the abandoned railroad right of way into a two-lane highway from the District of Columbia line to US 50 (now MD 450) near Lanham between 1942 and 1944. The WB {{had a pair of}} timber bridges across its right of way. The Chapel Road bridge in Seat Pleasant, which carried what was then MD 389 and is now Addison Road across the railroad, was removed; the junction was regraded as an intersection with the new highway. In 1944, the War Production Board authorized the replacement of MD 202's bridge across the abandoned railroad {{as one of the few}} nonwar-effort highway projects federally funded during World War II. Construction on the new steel-and-concrete bridge began in late 1944 and was completed by 1946. Access between the grade-separated highways at the MD 202MD 704 junction was via a pair of two-way ramps.|$|E
