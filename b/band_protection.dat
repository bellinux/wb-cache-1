30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel time {{reservation}} scheme, called Narrow <b>Band</b> <b>Protection</b> (NBP). NBP efficiently reduces the control overhead for the ZigBee channel reservation through a self-sensing mechanism, and allows ZigBee networks {{to compete with}} Wi-Fi networks even in an asymmetric scenario. Specifically, the NBP protector autonomously detects an ongoing ZigBee transmission and without any further delay, immediately reserves the channel until the transmission is completed. Also, the autonomous signal detection and protection are not affected by the control packet collisions. To give high fidelity of detection of low power ZigBee signals, NBP exploits the reliable cross-correlation technique[16, 17]. In addition, NBP can protect multiple continuous ZigBee packets by estimating {{the size of the}} burst. This is important because a ZigBee node is typically battery-powered and thus prefers low duty cycle operations[18 – 20].|$|E

30|$|The recent {{development}} of various wireless technologies in the 2.4 GHz ISM band {{has led to}} the co-channel coexistence of heterogeneous wireless devices, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee. This sharing of the common channel results in the challenging problem of cross-technology interference, since the wireless devices generally use diverse PHY/MAC specifications. In particular, the less capable ZigBee device may often experience unpredictably low throughput due to the interference from the powerful Wi-Fi. The ZigBee protector is an attractive solution, since it can reserve the channel on behalf of the weak ZigBee devices. The protector method, however, has a few limitations; (i) it may cause significant overhead to both ZigBee and Wi-Fi, and (ii) the ZigBee control packets are still vulnerable to the Wi-Fi interference. In this paper, we propose a novel time reservation scheme called Narrow <b>Band</b> <b>Protection</b> (NBP), that uses a protector to guard the ongoing ZigBee transmission. The key contributions are threefold: First, NBP autonomously detects any ongoing ZigBee transmissions by cross-correlating the ZigBee’s packets with the pre-defined Pseudo-random Noise (PN) sequences. By using this cross-correlation, it significantly reduces the control overhead. Second, due to the reliable cross-correlation, NBP is robust from the control packet collisions, which typically wastes channel time for both ZigBee and Wi-Fi. Third, NBP protects the burst of ZigBee packets by estimating the size of the burst, in turn, giving a semantic to the PN codebook. This is important because ZigBee is typically battery-powered and thus the long burst is advantageous for the low duty cycle operations. We first show the feasibility of NBP by implementing it on the real USRP/GNURadio platform. Then, we evaluate the performance of NBP through mathematical analysis and NS- 2 simulations. The results show that NBP enhances the ZigBee throughput by up to 1.77 x compared to the existing scheme.|$|E

In particular, the edge states residing inside the bulk gap remain conducting even when edge state inhomogeneities destroy the characteristic linear Dirac relation between energy and momentum. The main effects of boundary disorder on the in-gap states are to decrease the Fermi velocity, increase the density of states, pull the states into the disordered region if spin is conserved, and at very large disorder shift the states to {{the boundary between the}} disordered edge and the clean bulk. These effects, which may be useful for device engineering, are controlled by a resonance between the disordered edge and the bulk bands.

However, an 802.11 wireless network will handle multicast traffic differently, depending on the configuration of delivery traffic indication message (DTIM), and beacon interval settings.

In most retail wireless access points/routers, this interval is either 102.4 ms (Beacon interval = 100ms, DTIM = 1) or 204.8 ms (Beacon interval = 100ms, DTIM = 2) and the transmit rate is either 1 Mbit/s or 6 Mbit/s, depending on the operating <b>band</b> and <b>protection</b> mode.

Inactivation of either xylR or the xyl operator led to constitutive expression in the absence of xylose.

40|$|AbstractThe ciliary band is a {{distinct}} region of embryonic ectoderm that is specified between oral and aboral ectoderm. Flask-shaped ciliary cells and neurons differentiate in this region and they are patterned to form an integrated tissue that functions as the principal swimming and feeding organ of the larva. TGFβ signaling, which is known to mediate oral and aboral patterning of the ectoderm, has been implicated in ciliary band formation. We have used morpholino knockdown and ectopic expression of RNA to alter TGFβ signaling {{at the level of}} ligands, receptors, and signal transduction components and assessed the differentiation and patterning of the ciliary band cells and associated neurons. We propose that the primary effects of these signals are to position the ciliary cells, which in turn support neural differentiation. We show that Nodal signaling, which is known to be localized by Lefty, positions the oral margin of the ciliary band. Signaling from BMP through Alk 3 / 6, affects the position of the oral and aboral margins of the ciliary band. Since both Nodal and BMP signaling produce ectoderm that does not support neurogenesis, we propose that formation of a ciliary <b>band</b> requires <b>protection</b> from these signals. Expression of BMP 2 / 4 and Nodal suppress neural differentiation. However, the response to receptor knockdown or dominant-negative forms of signal transduction components indicate signaling is not acting directly on unspecified ectoderm cells to prevent their differentiation as neurons. Instead, it produces a restricted field of ciliary band cells that supports neurogenesis. We propose a model that incorporates spatially regulated control of Nodal and BMP signaling to determine the position and differentiation of the ciliary band, and subsequent neural patterning...|$|R

The {{official}} answer is that wide <b>bands</b> offer a <b>protection</b> against speculative pressure, while exchange rates may be kept within narrower margins at the discretion of the authorities. Yet if exchange rate fixity and predictability are desirable, as implicitly assumed by the mere existence of the system, there must exist a trade-off between protection against speculative pressure and predictability.

For the long-term member currencies (French franc, peseta, Danish krone and escudo), the existing 15 % bands are found to be unnecessarily wide: narrower 3. 5 % bands would capture at least 95 % of expected exchange rate realizations over a three-month horizon. For the lira, Finnish markka and Swedish krone, wider bands of 5 - 6 % would capture a similar amount of the exchange rate distribution.

We studied regularly interspaced banded patterns, formed by elongated patches of seagrass, in a small-scale intertidal ecosystem. We investigated (1) whether the observed spatial patterns may arise from feedback interactions between seagrass and its abiotic environment and (2) whether changes in abiotic conditions may lead to predictable changes in these spatial patterns. Field measurements, experiments, and a spatially explicit computer model identified a ‘‘scale-dependent feedback’’ (a mechanism for spatial self-organization) as a possible cause for the <b>banded</b> patterns. Increased <b>protection</b> from uprooting by improved anchoring with increasing seagrass density caused a local positive feedback. Sediment erosion around seagrass shoots increased with distance through the seagrass bands, hence causing a long-range negative feedback. Measurements across the depth gradient of the intertidal, together with model simulations, demonstrated that seagrass cover and mean patch size were predictably influenced by additional external stress caused by light limitation and desiccation. Thus, our study provides direct empirical evidence for a consistent response of spatial self-organized patterns to changing abiotic conditions, suggesting a potential use for self-organized spatial patterns as stress indicators in ecosystems. ...|$|R
