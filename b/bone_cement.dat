25|$|The femoral {{component}} is the component that fits in the femur (thigh bone). Bone is removed and the femur is shaped {{to accept the}} femoral stem with attached prosthetic femoral head (ball). There {{are two types of}} fixation: cemented and uncemented. Cemented stems use acrylic <b>bone</b> <b>cement</b> to form a mantle between the stem and to the bone. Uncemented stems use friction, shape and surface coatings to stimulate bone to remodel and bond to the implant. Stems are made of multiple materials (titanium, cobalt chromium, stainless steel, and polymer composites) and they can be monolithic or modular. Modular components consist of different head dimensions and/or modular neck orientations; these attach via a taper similar to a Morse taper. These options allow for variability in leg length, offset and version. Femoral heads are made of metal or ceramic material. Metal heads, made of cobalt chromium for hardness, are machined to size and then polished to reduce wear of the socket liner. Ceramic heads are more smooth than polished metal heads, have a lower coefficient of friction than a cobalt chrome head, and in theory will wear down the socket liner more slowly. As of early 2011, follow-up studies in patients have not demonstrated significant reductions in wear rates between the various types of femoral heads on the market. Ceramic implants are more brittle and may break after being implanted.|$|E
2500|$|In {{orthopedic}} surgery, PMMA <b>bone</b> <b>cement</b> is used {{to affix}} implants and to remodel lost bone. It is supplied as a powder with liquid methyl methacrylate (MMA). Although PMMA is biologically compatible, MMA {{is considered to be}} an irritant and a possible carcinogen. PMMA has also been linked to cardiopulmonary events in the operating room due to hypotension. <b>Bone</b> <b>cement</b> acts like a grout and not so much like a glue in arthroplasty. Although sticky, it does not bond to either the bone or the implant, it primarily fills the spaces between the prosthesis and the bone preventing motion. A disadvantage of this <b>bone</b> <b>cement</b> is that it heats up to [...] while setting that may cause thermal necrosis of neighboring tissue. A careful balance of initiators and monomers is needed to reduce the rate of polymerization, and thus the heat generated. A major consideration when using PMMA cement is the effect of stress shielding. Since PMMA has a Young's modulus between 1.8 and 3.1 GPa, which is lower than that of natural bone (around 14 GPa for human cortical bone), the stresses are loaded into the cement and so the bone no longer receives the mechanical signals to continue bone remodeling and so resorption will occur.|$|E

2500|$|The {{replacement}} joint, {{which was}} known as the Low Friction Arthroplasty, was lubricated with synovial fluid. The small femoral head (...) was chosen for Charnley's belief that it would have lower friction against the acetabular component and thus wear out the acetabulum more slowly. Unfortunately, the smaller head dislocated more easily. Alternative designs with larger heads such as the Mueller prosthesis were proposed. Stability was improved, but acetabular wear and subsequent failure rates were increased with these designs. The Teflon acetabular components of Charnley's early designs failed within a year or two of implantation. This prompted a search for a more suitable material. A German salesman showed a polyethylene gear sample to Charnley's machinist, sparking the idea to use this material for the acetabular component. The ultra high molecular weight polyethylene or UHMWPE acetabular component was introduced in 1962. Charnley's other major contribution was to use polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) <b>bone</b> <b>cement</b> to attach the two components to the bone.

40|$|Abstract: During polymerization, polymethyl {{methacrylate}} <b>bone</b> <b>cements</b> have complex viscoelastic characteristics. Within a short working time they transform from dough-like consistencies to solid cements. Therefore, {{the time at}} which a cement is introduced to cancellous bone surfaces and subjected to pressure is important, to achieve optimum flow and mechanical interdigitation. Achieving adequate mechanical interlock increases the area for load transfer and reduces localized bone–cement interface stresses. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure the flow characteristics for commercial <b>bone</b> <b>cements</b> as a function of time and calculate the apparent viscosities for the curing <b>bone</b> <b>cements.</b> The capillary extrusion method was used to measure the rate of flow of the curing cement, by means of a melt flow index apparatus, which was manufactured in-house. The tests were conducted using nozzles of different lengths and under two loads. This enabled the power index value, n, and the pressure at the die entry, P 0, to be calculated for each material with respect to time. Once the flow characteristics were determined, a series of formulae were used to calculate the shear rates, c, the shear stresses, t, and the apparent viscosities, ga, of the curing <b>bone</b> <b>cements.</b> The results indicated that acrylic <b>bone</b> <b>cements</b> are non-Newtonian, pseudoplastic materials, since the power index values are less than 1. 0 during the curing stage. The consistency indices, K, were calculated from the shear stress versus shear rate data. The apparent viscosities of the cements were found to increase with respect to increases in time. Clinically, it was considered desirable to inject and pressurize the cement into the medullary canal while its viscosity is relatively low in order to obtain maximum interdigitation into cancellous bone, provided adequate containment and a means of pressurization can be achieved. The pseudoplastic character of <b>bone</b> <b>cements</b> is responsible for their reduction in viscosity with increased shear rate, a property that may be exploited to enhance penetration with appropriate delivery...|$|R
