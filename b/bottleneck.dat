40|$|The {{management}} of <b>bottlenecks</b> {{has become a}} central topic in the planning and control of production systems. In this paper, we critically analyze <b>bottlenecks</b> from an economic perspective. Using a queueing network model, we demonstrate that <b>bottlenecks</b> are inevitable when {{there are differences in}} job arrival rates, processing rates, or costs of productive resources. These differences naturally lead to the creation of <b>bottlenecks</b> both for facilities design and demand planning problems. To evaluate <b>bottlenecks</b> from an economic perspective, we develop the notion of an "economic bottleneck," which defines resources as <b>bottlenecks</b> based on economic, rather than physical, characteristics...|$|R
50|$|Traffic <b>bottlenecks</b> are {{disruptions}} {{of traffic}} on a roadway caused either due to road design, traffic lights, or accidents. There are two general types of <b>bottlenecks,</b> stationary and moving <b>bottlenecks.</b> Stationary <b>bottlenecks</b> {{are those that}} arise due to a disturbance that occurs due to a stationary situation like narrowing of a roadway, an accident. Moving <b>bottlenecks</b> {{on the other hand}} are those vehicles or vehicle behavior that causes the disruption in the vehicles which are upstream of the vehicle. Generally moving <b>bottlenecks</b> are caused by heavy trucks as they are slow moving vehicles with less acceleration and also may make lane changes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bottlenecks</b> {{can also}} occur in other methods of transportation. Capacity <b>bottlenecks</b> {{are the most}} {{vulnerable}} points in a network and are very often the subject of offensive or defensive military actions. Capacity <b>bottlenecks</b> of strategic importance - such as the Panama Canal where traffic {{is limited by the}} infrastructure - are normally referred to as choke points; capacity <b>bottlenecks</b> of tactical value are referred to as mobility corridors.|$|R
5|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} a <b>bottleneck</b> causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion of individuals with total rod cell color blindness (achromatopsia) on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a <b>bottleneck,</b> inbreeding increases. This increases {{the damage done by}} recessive deleterious mutations, in a process known as inbreeding depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked to them, in a process of background selection. For recessive harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced {{as a consequence of the}} <b>bottleneck,</b> due to genetic purging.This leads to a further loss of genetic diversity. In addition, a sustained reduction in population size increases the likelihood of further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.|$|E
5|$|Entities {{undergoing}} {{uniparental inheritance}} and {{with little to}} no recombination {{may be expected to}} be subject to Muller's ratchet, the inexorable accumulation of deleterious mutations until functionality is lost. Animal populations of mitochondria avoid this buildup through a developmental process known as the mtDNA <b>bottleneck.</b> The <b>bottleneck</b> exploits stochastic processes in the cell to increase in the cell-to-cell variability in mutant load as an organism develops: a single egg cell with some proportion of mutant mtDNA thus produces an embryo where different cells have different mutant loads. Cell-level selection may then act to remove those cells with more mutant mtDNA, leading to a stabilisation or reduction in mutant load between generations. The mechanism underlying the <b>bottleneck</b> is debated, with a recent mathematical and experimental metastudy providing evidence for a combination of random partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions and random turnover of mtDNA molecules within the cell.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{from studies}} of {{mitochondrial}} DNA suggests that humans may have passed through a genetic <b>bottleneck</b> around this time that reduced genetic diversity below what would be expected given {{the age of the}} species. According to the Toba catastrophe theory, proposed by Stanley H. Ambrose of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1998, the effects of the Toba eruption may have decreased the size of human populations to only a few tens of thousands of individuals. However, this hypothesis is not widely accepted because similar effects on other animal species have not been observed, and paleoanthropology suggests there was no population <b>bottleneck.</b>|$|E
40|$|Intermodal {{transportation}} is often hampered by <b>bottlenecks</b> in transportation networks. One might therefore expect {{a large amount}} of academic and policy research to be available that clearly identifies the characteristics of these problems. However, this is not the case. The knowledge presented is rather fragmented and the range of the <b>bottlenecks</b> presented is wide. It fails to grasp {{the full extent of the}} problem and especially the cumulating and culminating effects of <b>bottlenecks,</b> for the scope of the research is often limited to a one-sided (logistics) perspective. A theoretical framework has been created to explore the multiple dimensions of <b>bottlenecks.</b> Empirical results show that a customer perspective, which emphasises the importance of the perspective of direct users of transport infrastructure, is the most prominent aspect lacking in the present understanding of <b>bottlenecks.</b> Furthermore, findings suggest that the conception of <b>bottlenecks</b> should be extended by incorporating other (often sectoral) dimensions to tackle the cumulating and culminating effects of <b>bottlenecks.</b> To conclude, an integrative perspective on the analysis of <b>bottlenecks</b> can add important insights to the present body of knowledge. This can be considered crucial information for policymakers as well as private parties dealing with <b>bottlenecks</b> in theory and in daily practice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Software systems {{obey the}} 80 / 20 rule: aggressively {{optimizing}} a vital few execution paths yields large speedups. However, finding the vital few paths can be difficult, especially for large systems like web applications. This paper describes {{a novel approach}} to finding <b>bottlenecks</b> in such systems, given (possibly very large) profiles of system executions. In the approach, for each kind of profile (for example, calltree profiles), a tool developer implements a simple profile interface that exposes a small set of primitives for selecting summaries of profile measurements and querying how summaries overlap. Next, an analyst uses a search tool, which is written to the profile interface and thus independent {{of the kind of}} profile, to find <b>bottlenecks.</b> Our search tool (<b>Bottlenecks)</b> manages the bookkeeping of the search for <b>bottlenecks</b> and provides heuristics that automatically suggest likely <b>bottlenecks.</b> In one case study, after using <b>Bottlenecks</b> for half an hour, one of the authors found 14 <b>bottlenecks</b> in IBMâ€™s WebSphere Application Server. By optimizing some of these <b>bottlenecks,</b> we obtained a throughput improvement of 23 % on the Trade 3 benchmark. The optimizations include novel optimizations of J 2 EE and Java security, which exploit the high temporal and spatial redundancy of security checks. ...|$|R
40|$|The present {{understanding}} of <b>bottlenecks</b> in the European transport network fails {{to grasp the}} cumulating and culminating effects of <b>bottlenecks,</b> for {{the scope of the}} research is in most cases limited to a one-sided (logistics) perspective. A theoretical framework has been created, which argues that <b>bottlenecks</b> should be interpreted as integrative, complex problems, operating on the cutting edge between transportation, spatial planning, environmental issues, economic development and transnational governance. This chapter will provide empirical evidence to support this framework, in a context of European transport corridor development. The theoretical framework has been tested in an empirical setting by zooming in on the European transport Corridor 24. In a first step, both general (macro-level) and specific (micro-level) <b>bottlenecks</b> have been identified by interviewing logistics experts. In a next step, these first results will be further used to perform an in-depth, qualitative analysis of <b>bottlenecks</b> in case-study areas along Corridor 24. One of the key findings is that <b>bottlenecks</b> emerge from different, sectoral perspectives. Moreover, these perspectives appear to be highly interrelated. In other words, more attention should be paid to the cumulating and culminating effects of <b>bottlenecks,</b> operating as comprehensive problem areas. The most important implication is that, when using a limited, sectoral perspective on <b>bottlenecks,</b> one loses track of the possible added value of sector-transcendent analyses. This will ultimately lead to inefficient use of transport networks. This chapter provides a new conceptualisation for the possibilities of inter-sectoral coordination in dealing with <b>bottlenecks</b> in the European transport network...|$|R

After that, theoretical model for identifying <b>bottlenecks</b> in Lean software development implementations is developed. At the end, this model is verified in a studied unit at Ericsson. Identified <b>bottlenecks</b> narrows down possible issues in agile software development implementations and allows focusing on the core problems.

5|$|There {{have been}} many known cases of {{population}} <b>bottleneck</b> in the recent past. Prior {{to the arrival of}} Europeans, North American prairies were habitat for millions of greater prairie chickens. In Illinois alone, their numbers plummeted from about 100 million birds in 1900 to about 50 birds in the 1990s. The declines in population resulted from hunting and habitat destruction, but the random consequence has been a loss of most of the species' genetic diversity. DNA analysis comparing birds from the mid century to birds in the 1990s documents a steep decline in the genetic variation in just in the latter few decades. Currently the greater prairie chicken is experiencing low reproductive success. However, <b>bottleneck</b> and genetic drift can lead to a genetic loss that increases fitness as seen in Ehrlichia.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of a microprocessor is determined by many factors, including the memory hierarchy, clock frequency, organization, etc. A different trade-off between these factors is made in each microprocessor design. The performance is determined {{on the one hand}} by the <b>bottlenecks</b> of the machine (e. g., memory accesses, mispredicted branches, etc.) and their associated penalties {{and on the other hand}} by the frequency by which the <b>bottlenecks</b> occur, which is largely a property of the executed program. It is therefore important that a benchmark suite stresses all major <b>bottlenecks</b> in a microprocessor. If not, the benchmark suite gives a skewed view on performance. A method is presented to determine the most important <b>bottlenecks</b> stressed by benchmarks by analyzing their execution times. This method is applied to the SPEC CPU 2000 benchmarks and it is shown that these benchmarks stress only about 4 important <b>bottlenecks.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In urban {{settings}} where space is at a premium, bus lanes can often only be created via {{the conversion of}} existing general-use lanes. This can be politically infeasible in cities where bus flows are low, because the converted lanes would be under-utilized and thereby squander road space. The roadway <b>bottlenecks</b> would then as a result create even greater delays and queuing for car traffic. The present thesis explores novel ways in which buses and cars might share lanes within select <b>bottlenecks.</b> Details of these shared-lane strategies vary, depending upon a <b>bottleneck's</b> local operating conditions. In all cases, cars would be inserted into a shared lane in ways that impart few delays to the buses. These insertions would allow for the unused space between buses to be used, lessening the damage otherwise incurred by car traffic at <b>bottlenecks.</b> Hence, by reducing the car delay at <b>bottlenecks</b> it may become feasible to deploy ordinary bus-lane conversions elsewhere throughout a city's road network. The ordinary lane conversions would enable buses to bypass the car queues that still form at <b>bottlenecks.</b> Analytical assessments unveil {{the wide range of}} bus flows for which these strategies increase a <b>bottleneck's</b> car-carrying capacity, in comparison to reserving one of its lanes for buses only. Simulations of a real case study indicate that significant reductions in car delays can result while increasing bus speeds as much as ordinary conversions...|$|R
