40|$|<b>Good</b> <b>values</b> are the {{foundation}} values which lead to the behaviour and important to be instilled to each individual particularly to the students. However, based on the previous researches, <b>good</b> <b>values</b> are less practiced among the students especially during their practical training in the laboratory. Therefore, this research is conducted to identify how far the students and lecturer have instilled the <b>good</b> <b>values</b> during {{the teaching and learning}} processes in the laboratory. About 226 Bachelor of Technical and Vocational Education's students are the respondents in this research. Questionnaire is the major instrument in this research beside interview and observation as the backup methods. The findings of this research indicate that students instil and practice all the <b>good</b> <b>values</b> involved in this research. However, it was found out that only several number of the lecturers instil and practice the <b>good</b> <b>values</b> to the students during the teaching and learning processes in the laboratory. So. researcher have offered a few suggestions to ensure the lecturers and students do instil and practice the <b>good</b> <b>values</b> such as: The Authority of Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM) need to do scheduled observation to ensure lecturers and students do instil and practice <b>good</b> <b>values</b> during teaching and learning processes...|$|R

40|$|Contingent {{valuation}} {{researchers have}} found that the hypothetical values respondents place on a nested sequence of environmental goods are sensitive to the order in which the goods are presented. Typically, the smallest bundle of <b>goods</b> is <b>valued</b> more highly if presented first than if following more comprehensive bundles. Such effects appear even when each bundle is valued from an "exclusive" list, or as an alternative to any other, so that income and substitution effects are controlled. We conduct lab experiments where participants are asked to value sequences of nested goods for purchase from an exclusive list using an incentive-compatible Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism. We test whether order effects occur in valuation for (a) induced <b>value</b> <b>goods,</b> (<b>b)</b> actual private <b>goods,</b> and (c) identical private goods that are to be donated to charities. We find significant order effects when the <b>goods</b> are <b>valued</b> for own use, but not when they are valued for donation. ...|$|R
