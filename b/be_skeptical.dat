When the European Commission recommended that Greece be allowed to join the eurozone in 1998, he demanded that the country be barred from adopting the common currency for several years instead. He is a staunch opponent of Turkey's integration into the European Union, claiming that its non-Christian culture would dilute the Union.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{women were}} often {{extremely}} reluctant {{to bring up}} charges of rape: public admission of having been raped was severely damaging to one's social standing, courts tended to <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> of the charges, conviction rates were low, and, {{in the event that}} the accusation could not be proved, the victim could then be accused of committing adultery with the rapist (traditionally a serious offense that could have been punished by mutilation or even death). Certain classes of women, such as prostitutes, were banned from raising accusations of rape altogether.|$|E

He was never happy with the position and resigned {{as chairman of the}} RDB after a year, but remained on the oversight committee. He continued to <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> about rockets and missiles, writing in his 1949 book, Modern Arms and Free Men, that intercontinental ballistic missiles would not be technically feasible [...] "for a long time to come... if ever".|$|E
500|$|On the Battle of Thermopylae itself, two {{principal}} sources, Herodotus' and Simonides' accounts, survive. In fact, Herodotus' {{account of the}} battle, in Book VII of his Histories, is such an important source that Paul Cartledge wrote: [...] "we either write a history of Thermopylae with , or not at all". Also surviving is an epitome of the account of Ctesias, by the eighth-century Byzantine Photias, though this is [...] "almost worse than useless", missing key events in the battle such as the betrayal of Ephialtes, and the account of Diodorus Siculus in his Universal History. Diodorus' account {{seems to have been}} based on that of Ephorus and contains one significant deviation from Herodotus' account: a supposed night attack against the Persian camp, of which modern scholars have tended to <b>be</b> <b>skeptical.</b>|$|E

VanDerWerff praised its continuing emphasis on themes surrounding the [...] "painful uncertainties of growing up", commenting that a fight scene between the main characters and the Changelings was [...] "as colorful and fun as anything I've seen on any TV program this season", and also praised Daniel Ingram's work on the soundtrack of the episodesincluding the [...] "This Day Aria" [...] musical number between the good and evil Princess Cadance, which he compared to the [...] "villain songs" [...] of the Disney Renaissance.

500|$|Writing in The Guardian, Brian Moylan {{described}} Going Clear as [...] "entertaining and dismaying viewing" [...] {{in which}} [...] "the story of Scientology, {{with all its}} strange players, emerges as comedy, rather than horror," [...] but criticised its reliance on {{a small group of}} defectors and the lack of any involvement by the church. He felt that this made the film [...] "a bit one-sided" [...] and that it was [...] "easy to <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> about some of the more outlandish claims made by former members." [...] Sasha Bronner of the Huffington Post called the film a [...] "shocking and eye-opening" [...] work that would leave those who did not know much about Scientology [...] "spellbound." [...] The BBC's Owen Gleiberman praised it as [...] "the most exciting – and disturbing – work of cinematic non-fiction in a long time" [...] and awarded Going Clear five stars, describing it as having [...] "the scary intensity of a thriller." ...|$|E
500|$|Dawkins sees {{education}} and consciousness-raising {{as the primary}} tools in opposing what he considers to be religious dogma and indoctrination. These tools include the fight against certain stereotypes, and he has adopted the term bright {{as a way of}} associating positive public connotations with those who possess a naturalistic worldview. He has given support {{to the idea of a}} free thinking school, which would not [...] "indoctrinate children" [...] but would instead teach children to ask for evidence, <b>be</b> <b>skeptical,</b> critical and open-minded. Such a school, says Dawkins, should [...] "teach comparative religion, and teach it properly without any bias towards particular religions, and including historically important but dead religions, such as those of ancient Greece and the Norse gods, if only because these, like the Abrahamic scriptures, are important for understanding English literature and European history. Inspired by the consciousness-raising successes of feminists in arousing widespread embarrassment at the routine use of [...] "he" [...] instead of [...] "she", Dawkins similarly suggests that phrases such as [...] "Catholic child" [...] and [...] "Muslim child" [...] should be considered as socially absurd as, for instance, [...] "Marxist child", as he believes that children should not be classified based on their parents' ideological or religious beliefs.|$|E
500|$|In {{the book}} The Films of Luc Besson, Susan Hayward {{considered}} The Fifth Element to be a classic {{story of a}} man [...] "making his break from the tribe, proving his manhood, over-throwing the malevolent forces and killing the chief, finally to reap the rewards of security and marriage". Korben's journey, however, is under threat not only from the Mangalores and Zorg, but also from Leeloo, who relents and helps him only at the last minute, accepting his declaration of love. The love story within The Fifth Element was considered {{to be one of the}} main narratives in the film, and it faces the same deadline as the main storyline. Hayward also considered the issue of environmental damage, in so far as waste and pollution are visible throughout the film. Whereas science fiction films often show a world wherein some new technology or threat either surpasses or fails humanity, The Films of Luc Besson included The Fifth Element amongst the minority of science fiction films that [...] "hold up a mirror" [...] and show humankind as responsible. The film was said to <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> of capitalist consumerism, in so far as the gadgets in Zorg's office make an unhealthy obsession of his lust for technology. The tension between technology and man is treated as a problem requiring a final resolution.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com in June 2011. He summed it up by saying [...] "What a dreadful episode. While it's important in the grand scheme of things in what it establishes about Data's background, the episode itself is horrendously bad, from the clumsy script to the embarrassingly inept body-double work." [...] He thought the ending was anticlimactic, and that the characters all acted [...] "as dumb as posts" [...] in the episode. The most positive thing he said of the episode was that [...] "Spiner's teeth marks are all over the scenery when he's onscreen as Lore". DeCandido gave [...] "Datalore" [...] a score of four out of ten. Cast member Wil Wheaton watched the episode for AOL TV in December 2007. While he credited the art direction of the episode, he criticised the story, saying that [...] "it comes down to lazy writing that has things happen because they're supposed to happen, rather than having them happen organically. The characters are credulous when they should <b>be</b> <b>skeptical,</b> the audience isn't surprised by anything after the second act, and there are story problems that should have never gotten past the first draft." [...] He remembered really enjoying the episode as a child, but felt that it didn't hold up on repeat watchings as an adult, and stated that Spiner's [...] "fantastic job creating distinctly different characters in Data and Lore" [...] wasn't enough to remedy the other faults in the episode. He gave it a D grade.|$|E
