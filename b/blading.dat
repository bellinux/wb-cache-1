The {{aim of this}} study was to find a relationship between the <b>BLAD</b> genotype of bulls, their genetic evaluation for milk and their daughters' milk production. BLAD-carrier and healthy bulls were compared on the basis of their breeding value published in November 1997.

In October 1993, Hart gave a radio interview {{in which he said}} Flair [...] "sucks" [...] and described his workplace, WCW, as [...] "minor league". In Flair's autobiography, Flair criticizes Hart for over-exploiting the death of his brother Owen and the controversy surrounding the Montreal Screwjob. Flair also claimed in his autobiography that—despite Hart's popularity in Canada—he was not a formidable money-making draw in the United States, a claim which Hart dismissed as [...] "plain ridiculous" [...] in a column written for the Calgary Sun. Hart claimed that he drew greater revenue than Flair, citing his headlining performances on consistently sold out tours throughout his WWF career, while Flair wrestled to allegedly near-empty arenas. He also criticized Flair on what he perceived as insults to fellow wrestlers Mick Foley and Randy Savage, both personal friends of Hart. Hart acknowledged a decline in the WWF's popularity during the mid-1990s, but he and others felt that this was largely attributed to the WWF's well publicized sex and steroid scandals, as well as WCW's acquisition of former top WWF stars. In contrast to Flair's claims, prominent industry historian Dave Meltzer said there was [...] "no denying" [...] Hart's major drawing power in the United States. WWE owner Vince McMahon asserted that whichever company hired Hart could [...] "have built the entire franchise around Hart" [...] and described him as an [...] "extraordinary star". McMahon added that it was [...] "fortunate for me, in terms of my company", that his chief competitor, WCW, did not utilize Hart to his full potential. WCW described Hart as [...] "an incredible international draw, attracting standing room only crowds in every corner of the globe". Professional wrestling magazine Power Slam has spoken to Hart's drawing power, placing him number 7 in [...] "The 10 Best U.S.-Style All-Rounders", a list that considered drawing ability along with workrate and promo skills. Hart also criticized Flair in his own autobiography, mainly his in-ring talent and what Hart perceived as Flair's unsubtle <b>blading.</b> However, they have reconciled and are now friends.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Bovine {{leukocyte}} adhesion deficiency (<b>BLAD),</b> {{deficiency of}} uridine monophosphate synthase (DUMPS), complex vertebral malformation (CVM), bovine citrullinaemia (BC) and factor XI deficiency (FXID) are autosomal recessive hereditary disorders, which have had significant economic impact on dairy cattle breeding worldwide. In this study, 350 Holstein cows reared in Turkey were screened for <b>BLAD,</b> DUMPS, CVM, BC and FXID genotypes to obtain an indication {{on the importance of}} these defects in Turkish Holsteins. Methods Genomic DNA was obtained from blood and the amplicons of <b>BLAD,</b> DUMPS, CVM, BC and FXID were obtained by using PCR. PCR products were digested with Taq I, Ava I and Ava II restriction enzymes for <b>BLAD,</b> DUMPS, and BC, respectively. These digested products and PCR product of FXID were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide. CVM genotypes were detected by DNA sequencing. Additionally, all genotypes were confirmed by DNA sequencing to determine whether there was a mutant allele or not. Results Fourteen <b>BLAD,</b> twelve CVM and four FXID carriers were found among the 350 Holstein cows examined, while carriers of DUMPS and BC were not detected. The mutant allele frequencies were calculated as 0. 02, 0. 017, and 0. 006 for <b>BLAD,</b> CVM and FXID, respectively with corresponding carrier prevalence of 4. 0 % (<b>BLAD),</b> 3. 4 % (CVM) and 1. 2 % (FXID). Conclusion This study demonstrates that carriers of <b>BLAD,</b> CVM and FXID are present in the Turkish Holstein population, although at a low frequency. The actual number of clinical cases is unknown, but sporadic cases may appear. As artificial insemination is widely used in dairy cattle breeding, carriers of <b>BLAD,</b> CVM and FXID are likely present within the population of breeding sires. It is recommended to screen breeding sires for these defective genes in order to avoid an unwanted spread within the population. </p...|$|R

Unusually, Carlin-M Ivanhoe Bell was a carrier for two genetic diseases, CVM and Bovine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (<b>BLAD).</b> The <b>BLAD</b> and CVM genes are located in different chromosomes. When the sire (father) of Carlin-M Ivanhoe Bell, a bull named Penstate Ivanhoe Star, was tested he was found to be a carrier of both CVM and <b>BLAD.</b> Carlin-M Ivanhoe Bell's grandsire Osborndale Ivanhoe, however, carried only <b>BLAD.</b> Scientists therefore believe that the mutation responsible for CVM occurred either in Penstate Ivanhoe Starissa, or somewhere in his maternal family.|$|R
