5|$|The 2010 {{eruption}} of Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland highlighted {{the impacts of}} volcanic ash fall in modern society and our dependence on the functionality of infrastructure services. During this event the airline industry suffered <b>business</b> <b>interruption</b> losses of €1.5-2.5 billion from the closure of European airspace for six days in April 2010 and subsequent closures into May 2010. Ash fall from this event is also known to have caused local crop losses in agricultural industries, losses in the tourism industry, destruction of roads and bridges in Iceland (in combination with glacial melt water), and costs associated with emergency response and clean-up. However, across Europe there were further losses associated with travel disruption, the insurance industry, the postal service, and imports and exports across Europe and worldwide. These consequences demonstrate the interdependency and diversity of impacts from a single event.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{observes the}} impacts of <b>business</b> <b>interruptions</b> on <b>business,</b> which is a {{relatively}} new area of research. Since the extant theory concentrates mainly on supply chain disruptions the understanding of <b>business</b> <b>interruptions</b> is narrow. Companies suffer increasingly from supply chain disruptions due to just-in-time strategies, globalization and outsourcing, but the risks that threaten companies' business continuity are much more diverse rendering this study to seek answers to fill the gap between practical concerns and current academic research as well as to increase the general understanding of the importance of business continuity. As risks have soared, companies have become concerned of their business continuity. This study presents the concept of resilience in business context so that the vague understanding of it could be deeper, and applied in the operations to mitigate losses. The topic is approached by literature research, which aims at collecting the relevant findings about <b>business</b> <b>interruptions.</b> It is followed by a framework, which was created to give a means to evaluate preparedness for risks. As for the empiric methodology, seven theme interviews representing four case companies, and a questionnaire provide the additional material for the research of this topic in practice. Companies are generally aware of their risks and vulnerabilities, but because the competition is so tough, the resources are so scarce that companies cannot afford costly risk management and resilience methods although they would need them. Therefore, resilience should be targeted to the vulnerabilities so that the resources would be applied optimally. Usually companies cannot invest to all kinds of resilience, so the best use of the money is to find the balance between vulnerability and resilience (Pettit et al. 2010). Risk management and resilience should be taken seriously because <b>business</b> <b>interruptions</b> can have several adverse long-lasting consequences. Hence, the efforts on risk management are very important, especially when business strategies that reduce working capital and redundancies are applied. However, risk management should be economically viable and justified by calculations (Chopra and Sodhi 2004, and Norrman and Jansson 2004) ...|$|R

40|$|The most {{valuable}} asset of any organization is data. Should this data be lost, {{it can be}} a potential threat to any business.

In the client-server model, all the data is stored on a server and the clients access it. This system has its own disadvantages. The fundamental one being that the space on the client machines is not utilized to the fullest. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose a model in which server utilizes the available space on the client machines which can be used for backup. Thus we describe a novel method which stores the data on the clients rather than on the server. Hence the cost, risk of losing the data and dependency on the server is reduced as well as the client storage space is fully utilized. Thus optimum usage of storage space on the clients to improve the efficiency and reliability of data storage on the network is the main aim of the project...|$|R
30|$|In the literature, {{cost-benefit}} analysis (CBA) has been employed extensively {{in analyzing the}} cost-effectiveness of DRR investments. Studies have mainly focused on structural mitigation measures, particularly earthquake retrofitting, and mostly for developed countries (Nuti and Vanzi 2003; Jonkman et al. 2004; Padgett et al. 2010; Li 2012; Liel and Deierlein 2013). The literature suggests {{that the benefits of}} hazard mitigation should be measured in terms of losses avoided, that is, those losses that would have occurred had the measures not been put into place (World Bank 2014). Those benefits generally include reducing direct property damage and fatalities, and sometimes indirect impacts such as reducing <b>business</b> <b>interruptions</b> (Rose et al. 2007). As a typical financial appraisal, CBA converts all benefits and costs into monetary units, and uses the net present value, benefit-cost ratio (B/C), or internal rate of return (Kull et al. 2013) to indicate the cost-effectiveness of the DRR measures under discussion. Many of the analyses in developed countries and international community-supported projects in less-developed countries have provided convincing evidence of the value of investing in proactive risk management using mitigation and ex ante financing instruments (Mechler 2005; Rose et al. 2007; Wethli 2013).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. All {{business}} {{organizations are}} exposed to supply-side risk that can result in business failures, disruptions or shutdowns. This session will present a model for addressing business continuity and share various principles and effective practices obtained from in-depth case study research of leading-edge firms. The Opportunity. All business organizations {{are exposed to}} operational risk. Most managers, when they think about such risk, {{tend to focus on}} those risks that affect internal operations. Accidents, natural disasters, and intentional malicious acts all have the potential to seriously disrupt or shut down internal operations. While critical, all risks are not internal. Increasingly, as more firms begin to rely on the supply chain and the capabilities of their suppliers, managers and researchers are coming to realize the true impact of supply-side disruptions (Zsidisin, 2003; Barnes 2001; Gilbert and Gips 2000). Business failures, disruptions or shutdowns among a firm’s suppliers or in its inbound logistics channels can easily create a ripple effect of <b>business</b> <b>interruptions</b> throughout the supply chain. They can also seriously and strategically impact overall performance. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} a formalized system that identifies such risks, qualifies the associated risks and then provides procedures...|$|R
