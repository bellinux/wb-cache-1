5|$|Brook Farm {{was named}} for the brook that ran near the {{roadside}} and that eventually went to the Charles River. It was surrounded <b>by</b> <b>low</b> hills and its meadows and sunny slopes were diversified by orchard, quiet groves and denser pine woods. The land, however, {{turned out to be}} difficult to farm.|$|E
5|$|CSS Missouri was a Confederate States Navy casemate ironclad paddle steamer {{deployed}} on the Red River {{during the}} American Civil War. For {{most of the}} war she was trapped in the Shreveport, Louisiana area <b>by</b> <b>low</b> water on the Red River. The ship was surrendered in June 1865 to the United States Navy and sold in November.|$|E
5|$|Games {{tended to}} be {{characterized}} <b>by</b> <b>low</b> scores and frequent punting, with crowds between 10,000 and 20,000; these numbers dropped off {{in the last two}} games of the era. A low scoring BC–Calgary game in Everett, Washington in 1967 drew just over 6,000; there would not be another CFL game in the United States until the cusp of US expansion itself in 1992.|$|E
25|$|The Indian {{government}} classifies {{government jobs}} in four groups. The Group A jobs are senior most, high paying {{positions in the}} government, while Group D are junior most, lowest paying positions. In Group D jobs, the percentage of positions held <b>by</b> <b>lowest</b> caste classified people is 30% greater than their demographic percentage. In all jobs classified as Group C positions, the percentage of jobs held <b>by</b> <b>lowest</b> caste people {{is about the same}} as their demographic population distribution. In Group A and B jobs, the percentage of positions held <b>by</b> <b>lowest</b> caste classified people is 30% lower than their demographic percentage.|$|R

5|$|Herrmann {{realized}} that musicians slated {{to play his}} music were hired for individual unique sessions; {{there was no need}} to write for existing ensembles. This meant that he was free to score for unusual combinations of instruments, even instruments that are not commonly heard. In the opening sequence, for example, the tour of Kane's estate Xanadu, Herrmann introduces a recurring leitmotiv played <b>by</b> <b>low</b> woodwinds, including a quartet of alto flutes.|$|E
5|$|Holocene {{lava flows}} are more alkalic than the Pleistocene lava flows and {{comprise}} several xenoliths of chromium-spinel lherzolite, spinel clinopyroxenite, and rare ferroan websterite and spinel wehrlite. Xenoliths {{do not exist}} in the older lava flows. However, chemical evidence indicates that every lava flow was produced in a similar way <b>by</b> <b>low</b> degrees of piecemeal melting. The melts originally came from the upper mantle which, over time, was progressively depleted by every following melting event.|$|E
5|$|Iron(II) {{complexes}} {{are less}} stable than iron(III) complexes but {{the preference for}} O-donor ligands is less marked, so that for example 2+ is known while 3+ is not. They {{have a tendency to}} be oxidized to iron(III) but this can be moderated <b>by</b> <b>low</b> pH and the specific ligands used.|$|E

50|$|The land {{under what}} would become the {{historic}} district was purchased in 1796 <b>by</b> Nicholas <b>Low,</b> a prominent New York merchant. The houses were built in 1844 (MacDougal Street) and 1850 (Sullivan Street) <b>by</b> <b>Low's</b> estate, in the fashionable Greek Revival style. The original plans for the houses called for street level retail space and dormered roofs.|$|R
5|$|Like much of British post-war planning, {{regeneration}} of Bristol {{city centre}} was characterised by large, cheap tower blocks, brutalist architecture {{and expansion of}} roads. Since the 1990s this trend has been reversed, with the closure of some main roads and the regeneration of the Broadmead shopping centre. In 2006 {{one of the city}} centre's tallest post-war blocks was torn down. Social housing tower blocks have also been demolished to be replaced <b>by</b> <b>low</b> rise homes.|$|E
5|$|Lunar swirls are enigmatic {{features}} found {{across the}} Moon's surface, which {{are characterized by}} a high albedo, appearing optically immature (i.e. the optical characteristics of a relatively young regolith), and often displaying a sinuous shape. Their curvilinear shape is often accentuated <b>by</b> <b>low</b> albedo regions that wind between the bright swirls.|$|E
5|$|Palladium is a metal {{with low}} toxicity. It is poorly absorbed by human body when digested. Plants {{such as the}} water {{hyacinth}} are killed <b>by</b> <b>low</b> levels of palladium salts, but most other plants tolerate it, although tests show that, at levels above 0.0003%, growth is affected. High doses of palladium could be poisonous; tests on rodents suggest it may be carcinogenic, though no clear evidence indicates the element harms humans.|$|E

5|$|Porosity, {{often not}} visible {{without the use}} of {{advanced}} nondestructive testing methods, is a serious concern because it can potentially weaken the weld. Another defect affecting the strength of the weld is poor fusion, though it is often easily visible. It is caused <b>by</b> <b>low</b> current, contaminated joint surfaces, or the use of an improper electrode.|$|E
5|$|Selenium deficiency, defined <b>by</b> <b>low</b> (<60% of normal) {{selenoenzyme}} {{activity levels}} in brain and endocrine tissues, occurs {{only when a}} low selenium level is linked with an additional stress, such as high exposures to mercury or increased oxidant stress from vitamin E deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Some {{other studies}} have {{proposed}} that issues with the spinal venous drainage system may cause a CSF leak.

5|$|The D± signals used <b>by</b> <b>low,</b> full, {{and high}} speed are carried over a twisted pair (typically, unshielded) to reduce noise and crosstalk. SuperSpeed uses {{separate}} transmit and receive differential pairs, which additionally require shielding (typically, {{shielded twisted pair}} but twinax is also mentioned by the specification). Thus, to support SuperSpeed data transmission, cables contain twice as many wires and are thus larger in diameter.|$|E

From Cobbs Creek downstream to its mouth, the creek is in a tidal flat.|$|E
