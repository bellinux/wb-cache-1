40|$|Recent {{research}} on the <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite</b> species complex has revealed extensive genetic diversity that has distinguished several genetic lineages infesting bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and other cereals worldwide. Turkey is the historical region of wheat and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) domestication and diversification. The close relationship between these grasses and the <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite</b> provoked {{the question of the}} genetic diversity of the <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite</b> in this region. The scope {{of the study was to}} investigate genetic differentiation within the <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite</b> species complex on grasses in Turkey. Twenty-one <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite</b> populations from 16 grass species from nine genera (Agropyron sp., Aegilops sp., Bromus sp., Elymus sp., Eremopyrum sp., Hordeum sp., Poa sp., Secale sp., and Triticum sp.) were sampled in eastern and southeastern Turkey for genetic analyses. Two molecular markers were amplified: the cytochrome oxidase subunit I coding region of mtDNA (COI) and the D 2 region of 28 S rDNA. Phylogenetic analyses revealed high genetic variation of the <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite</b> in Turkey, primarily on Bromus and Hordeum spp., and exceptionally high diversity of populations associated with bread wheat. Three wheat-infesting <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite</b> lineages known to occur on other continents of the world, including North and South America, Australia and Europe, were found in Turkey, and at least two new genetic lineages were discovered. These regions of Turkey exhibit rich <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite</b> diversity on native grass species. The possible implications for further studies on the <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite</b> are discussed.

40|$|The <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite,</b> Aceria tosichella Keifer, is an {{eriophyid}} pest of wheat, {{although its}} primary economic impact on wheat {{is due to}} the transmission of Wheat streak mosaic (WSMV), Wheat mosaic (also known as High Plains virus), and Triticum mosaic (TriMV) viruses. These viruses cause significant annual losses in winter wheat production throughout the western Great Plains. Temperature and humidity are factors that often influence arthropod survival, especially during dispersal from their hosts, yet the impact of these two factors on off-host survival has not been documented for <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite.</b> Pathogen- infected host plants often influence the biology and behavior of vectors, yet it is not known if virus-infected wheat affects off-host survival of <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite.</b> The objectives of this study were to 1) determine if temperature, relative humidity, and mite genotype impact off-host survival of <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite</b> and 2) determine the effect of WSMV- and TriMV-infected host plants on off-host survival of <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite.</b> Temperature and relative humidity significantly affected off-host survival of <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite.</b> Length of survival decreased with increasing temperature (106. 2 h at 10 °C and 17. 0 h at 30 °C) and decreasing relative humidity (78. 1 h at 95 and 21. 3 h at 2 %). Mites from TriMV-infected host plants had ~ 20 % reduction in survival at 20 °C compared with those from WSMV-infected plants.

In the field it is extremely difficult to visually differentiate plants infected with WSMV from those with HPV. An indirect protein-A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PAS-ELISA) and Western blot analysis were used to identify WSMV and HPV.

Although both tritimoviruses and potyviruses encode helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) homologues (required for nonpersistent aphid transmission of potyviruses), sequence conservation is low (amino acid identity, ~ 16 %), and a role for HC-Pro in semipersistent transmission of WSMV by the <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite</b> (Aceria tosichella [Keifer]) has not been investigated. <b>Wheat</b> curl <b>mite</b> transmissibility was abolished by replacement of WSMV HC-Pro with homologues of an aphid transmitted potyvirus (Turnip mosaic virus), a rymovirus (Agropyron mosaic virus) vectored by a different eriophyid mite, or a closely related tritimovirus (Oat necrotic mottle virus; ONMV) with no known vector. In contrast, both WSMV-Sidney 81 and a chimeric WSMV genome bearing HC-Pro of a divergent strain (WSMV-El Bata´n 3; 86 % amino acid sequence identity) were efficiently transmitted by A. tosichell.

40|$|The wheat-mite-virus {{complex is}} an {{important}} production constraint to winter wheat production in the Great Plains, and consists of three viruses; wheat streak mosaic (WSMV), wheat mosaic (WMoV) and Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV). Synergistic interactions between these viruses have resulted in increased rates of replication and transmission of viruses, thus increasing the potential impact on wheat yields. The <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite</b> (WCM), Aceria tosichella Keifer is the only known vector of the viruses within the wheat-mite-virus complex. Currently, three colonies of WCM have been characterized by differential responses to mite resistant genes (biotypes) in wheat and differential transmission of WMoV. A {{study was designed to}} determine TriMV transmission for these various <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite</b> colonies. For each source plant, individual mites were transferred to 10 separate test plants and virus transmission determined via ELISA. Results indicate that TriMV is only transmitted by one of the three <b>wheat</b> curl <b>mite</b> colonies using single mite transfers. An additional study was conducted to determine the impact of TriMV on the biology of the WCM. TriMV infected and uninfected plants were infested with 10 mites from each colony with population counts being taken every seven days. Results indicated that TriMV had a negative impact on the reproductive potential of the WCM. The results demonstrate the importance of the mite source on virus epidemiology. Management tactics to reduce the impact of the wheat-mite-virus complex have focused primarily on the control of volunteer wheat; however, these tactics are not always effective at reducing yield losses.
