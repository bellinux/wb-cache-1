The poppy was 38m in size with a 28m long stalk. The staff wore red rain ponchos, with the black centre of the poppy formed by the uniforms of Royal Navy personnel. The Doughnut was illuminated with yellow light to mark GCHQ staff's support for Guide Dogs and by a spectrum of colours to mark the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and <b>Biphobia.</b> An annual Community Day is held at the Doughnut to highlight the charitable and volunteer work by GCHQ staff in the local Cheltenham community.|$|E

25|$|<b>Biphobia</b> is aversion toward {{bisexuality}} {{and toward}} bisexual {{people as a}} social group or as individuals. It can {{take the form of}} denial that bisexuality is a genuine sexual orientation, or of negative stereotypes about people who are bisexual (such as the beliefs that they are promiscuous or dishonest). People of any sexual orientation can experience or perpetuate <b>biphobia,</b> and it is a source of social discrimination against bisexual people.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biphobia</b> {{need not}} be a phobia as defined in {{clinical}} psychology (i.e., an anxiety disorder). Its meaning and use typically parallel those of xenophobia.|$|E
25|$|Anarcho-queer {{is a form}} a {{socialism}} {{which suggests}} anarchism {{as a solution to}} the issues faced by the LGBT community, mainly heteronormativity, homophobia, transphobia and <b>biphobia.</b> Anarcho-queer arose during the late 20th century {{based on the work of}} Michel Foucault The History of Sexuality.|$|E
25|$|Bisexual erasure (or {{bisexual}} invisibility) is {{the tendency}} to ignore, remove, falsify, or reexplain evidence of bisexuality in culture, history, academia, news media and other primary sources. In its most extreme form, bisexual erasure includes denying that bisexuality exists. It is often a manifestation of <b>biphobia,</b> although {{it does not necessarily}} involve overt antagonism.|$|E
25|$|While {{the general}} {{bisexual}} {{population as a}} whole faces <b>biphobia,</b> this oppression is also aggravated by other factors such as race. In his examination of the bisexual male perspective, entitled, Managing Heterosexism and Biphobia: A Revealing Black Bisexual Male Perspective, Grady L. Garner delves into the oppression that he faces as both a black and bisexual male. He explains that the internalization of negative sociocultural messages, reactions, and attitudes can be incredibly distressing as bisexual black males attempted to translate or transform these negative experiences into positive bisexual identity sustaining ones. The experience of bisexual black males is different from that of bisexual white males. As the demands and tribulations of black bisexual males appear to be comparatively more distressing than those that black and white, homo- and heterosexual individual's encounter, this acknowledgement is important and vital to the understanding of <b>biphobia</b> from an intersectional perspective.|$|E
25|$|A {{commonly}} {{stated goal}} among these movements is social equality for LGBT people, {{but there is}} still denial of full LGBT+ rights. Some have also focused on building LGBT+ communities or worked towards liberation for the broader society from <b>biphobia,</b> homophobia, and transphobia. There is a struggle for LGBT rights today. LGBT movements organized today are made up {{of a wide range of}} political activism and cultural activity, including lobbying, street marches, social groups, media, art, and research.|$|E
500|$|A {{belief in}} [...] "lesbian & gay separatism" [...] (not to be {{confused}} with the related [...] "lesbian separatism"), holds that lesbians and gay men form (or should form) a community distinct and separate from other groups normally included in the LGBTQ sphere. While not always appearing of sufficient number or organization to be called a movement, separatists are a significant, vocal, and active element within many parts of the LGBT community. In some cases separatists will deny the existence or right to equality of nonmonosexual orientations and of transsexuality. This can extend to public <b>biphobia</b> and transphobia. In contrasts to separatists, Peter Tatchell of the LGBT human rights group OutRage! argues that to separate the transgender movement from the LGB would be [...] "political madness", stating that [...] "Queers are, like transgender people, gender deviant. We don’t conform to traditional heterosexist assumptions of male and female behaviour, in that we have sexual and emotional relationships with the same sex. We should celebrate our discordance with mainstream straight norms." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Biphobia</b> {{can lead}} people {{to deny that}} {{bisexuality}} is [...] "real", asserting that people who identify as bisexual are not genuinely bisexual, or that the phenomenon is far less common than they claim. One form of this denial {{is based on the}} heterosexist view that heterosexuality is the only true or natural sexual orientation. Thus anything that deviates from that is instead either a psychological pathology or an example of anti-social behavior. In these instances, homophobia and <b>biphobia</b> are largely the same.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, in May 2014, Bishop Charles Scicluna of Malta {{attended}} an event organised by the Maltese Catholic gay rights group Drachma to mark International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and <b>Biphobia.</b> In Ireland, Archbishop Diarmuid Martin of Dublin reacted to concerns over anti-gay {{comments in the}} media by saying that [...] "anybody who doesn't show love towards {{gay and lesbian people}} is insulting God. They are not just homophobic if they do that — they are actually Godophobic because God loves every one of those people." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{mental and}} sexual {{health effects of}} <b>biphobia</b> on {{bisexual}} people are numerous. Studies show that bisexuals are often trapped in between the binaries of heterosexuality and homosexuality, creating a form of invalidation around their sexual identity. This often leads to recognized indicators of mental health issues such as low self-esteem and self-worth. These indicators and pressures to [...] "choose" [...] a sexual identity can, in many cases, lead to depression as they may feel {{they live in a}} culture that does not recognize their existence.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Biphobia</b> {{is common}} from the {{heterosexual}} community, but is frequently exhibited by {{gay and lesbian}} people as well, usually with the notion that bisexuals are able to escape oppression from heterosexuals by conforming to social expectations of opposite-gender sex and romance. This leaves some that identify as bisexual to be perceived as [...] "not enough of either" [...] or [...] "not real." [...] An Australian study conducted by Roffee and Waling in 2016 established that bisexual people faced microaggressions, bullying, and other anti-social behaviors from people within the lesbian and gay community.|$|E
2500|$|In many cultures, {{homosexual}} {{people are}} frequently subject to prejudice and discrimination. A 2011 Dutch {{study concluded that}} 49% of Holland's youth and 58% of youth foreign to the country reject homosexuality. [...] Similar to other minority groups {{they can also be}} subject to stereotyping. These attitudes tend to be due to forms of homophobia and heterosexism (negative attitudes, bias, and discrimination in favor of opposite-sex sexuality and relationships). Heterosexism can include the presumption that everyone is heterosexual or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the norm and therefore superior. [...] is a fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against homosexual people. It manifests in different forms, and a number of different types have been postulated, among which are internalized homophobia, social homophobia, emotional homophobia, rationalized homophobia, and others. Similar is lesbophobia (specifically targeting lesbians) and <b>biphobia</b> (against bisexual people). When such attitudes manifest as crimes they are often called hate crimes and gay bashing.|$|E
2500|$|Blasingame {{argued that}} in reality dichotomies are {{inaccurate}} to the representation of individuals because nothing is truly black or white, straight or gay. Her main argument is that <b>biphobia</b> is the central message of two roots; internalized heterosexism and racism. Internalized heterosexism is described in the monosexual paradigm in which the binary states that you are either straight or gay and nothing in between. Gays and lesbians accept this internalized heterosexism by morphing into the monosexial paradigm and favoring single attraction and opposing attraction for both sexes. Blasingame described this favoritism {{as an act of}} horizontal hostility, where oppressed groups fight amongst themselves. Racism is described in the monosexual paradigm as a dichotomy where individuals are either black or white, again nothing in between. The issue of racism comes into fruition in regards to the bisexuals coming out process, where risks of coming out vary on a basis of anticipated community reaction and also in regards to the norms among bisexual leadership, where class status and race factor predominately over sexual orientation.|$|E
2500|$|One {{cause of}} <b>biphobia</b> {{in the gay}} male {{community}} {{is that there is}} an identity political tradition to assume that acceptance of male homosexuality is linked to the belief that men's sexuality is specialized. This causes many members of the gay male community to assume that the very idea that men can be bisexual is homophobic to gay men. A number of bisexual men feel that such attitudes force them to keep their bisexuality in the closet and that it is even more oppressive than traditional heteronormativity. These men argue that the gay male community have something to learn about respect for the individual from the lesbian community, in which there is not a strong tradition to assume links between notions about the origins of sexual preferences and the acceptance thereof. These views are also supported by some gay men who do not like anal sex (sides, as opposed to both tops and bottoms) and report that they feel bullied by other gay men's assumption that their dislike for anal sex is [...] "homophobic" [...] and want more respect for the individuality in which a gay man who do not hate himself may simply not like anal sex and instead prefer other sex acts such as mutual fellatio and mutual male masturbation.|$|E
