50|$|A rupture disc, {{also known}} as a burst disc, {{bursting}} disc, or <b>burst</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> is a onetime use, non-reclosing pressure relief device that, in most uses, protects a pressure vessel, equipment or system from over pressurization or potentially damaging vacuum conditions. A rupture disc is a sacrificial part because it has a one-time-use membrane that fails at a predetermined differential pressure, either positive or vacuum. The membrane is usually made out of metal, but nearly any material can be used to suit a particular application. Rupture discs provide instant response (within milliseconds) to an increase or decrease in system pressure, but once the disc has ruptured it will not reseal. Due to the one time usage of this disc it requires someone to replace the plate once it has ruptured. One time usage devices are initially cost effective, but can become time consuming and labor-intensive to repeatedly change out.|$|R

Our preferred method of measuring initiation phenomena involves the use of magnetic particle velocity gauges.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a foundation of scaling laws for the highly nonlinear waves associated with the launch vehicle, the basic knowledge of the relationships among the paramaters pertinent to the energy dissipation process associated with the propagation of nonlinear pressure waves in thermoviscous media is required. The problem of interest is to experimentally investigate the temporal and spacial velocity profiles of fluid flow in a 3 -inch open-end pipe of various lengths, produced by the propagation of nonlinear pressure waves for various <b>diaphragm</b> <b>burst</b> pressures of a pressure wave generator. As a result, temporal and spacial characteristics of wave propagation for a parametric set of nonlinear pressure waves in the pipe containing air under atmospheric conditions were determined.

Pressure oscillations are generated as the initially normal shock wave diffracts from the diaphragm’s orifice and reflects on the shock tube walls, with the lowest local frequency roughly equal to the ratio of the sound speed in the perturbed region to the shock tube diameter. The energy integral of the perturbations decreases with increasing distance from the diaphragm, as the diffracted leading shock and downwind reflections coalesce into a single normal shock.

40|$|The {{explosive}} boiling {{that occurs}} when a volatile liquid is suddenly vented to the atmosphere has been investigated experimentally. Refrigerant 22 is used as the test liquid and is depressurized from an initial state of equilibrium using a <b>bursting</b> foil <b>diaphragm.</b> The competition between the rates of venting and vapor generation can lead to substantial repressurization within the vessel. The influence of vent area, quantity of liquid, initial pressure and pre-nucleation on the explosive boiling characteristics has been studied in a 260 ml Teflon-coated vessel {{as well as in}} a 75 ml glass tube. The amount of repressurization is found to be proportional to the pressure drop which determines the degree of superheat attained by the liquid. The time for repressurization is typically an order of magnitude larger than the time for the pressure drop. The repressurization in both vessels reaches a maximum value at an initial saturation vapor pressure of $ approx$ 2 MPa. The dependence of the repressurization on initial pressure observed experimentally is found to be consistent with the predictions of a semi-empirical correlation based on homogeneous nucleation theory. High-speed photography shows that the mode of boiling is dependent on the initial vapor pressure and the surface condition of the vessel walls. Heterogeneous boiling from the walls dominates in the Teflon-coated steel vessel. For initial vapor pressures less than $ approx$ 1 MPa, an evaporation wave propagates at $ approx$ 0. 15 m/s from the free surface throughout the length of the glass tube. For higher initial vapor pressures the boiling mode in the glass tube becomes predominantly heterogeneous.

40|$|In recent decades, improvised {{explosive}} devices {{have been one of}} the main causes of injuries due to blast effects to military personnel as well as civilians. Such injuries are very complex, with multiple types of injuries happening at once. To understand the nature of such injuries, it is important to be able to re-create the blast waves, isolating their different time-dependent effects (e. g. initial accelerations by shock waves, ballistic impacts, etc.). The shock tube is a versatile apparatus that can generate these elements of blasts in laboratory environment. The project aims to deepen the current understanding about the shock tube by characterising it over a range of conditions such as diaphragm breakage, and to measure the evolution of the pressure generated. Then, based on these characterisations, additional adjustments and adaptors are introduced to adapt the performance of the shock tube to specific purposes, especially blast injury and mitigation studies. Experiments were per- formed on an air-driven shock tube system with Mylar and aluminium diaphragms of various thicknesses, and with different lengths of driver section. Single-diaphragm and double-diaphragm configurations were employed, as were open or closed tube configurations. The arrangement was designed to enable high-speed photography and pressure measurements. Overall, the results from the shock tube are highly reproducible, and show that <b>diaphragm</b> <b>burst</b> pressure is the most influential factor on the output pressure pulses. The <b>diaphragm</b> <b>burst</b> pressure is shown to be linearly related to its thickness in the range studied. Com- paring single and double diaphragm systems, both produce similar effects but the latter provides more control over the generation of blast waves. The output blasts were also characterised against different locations, orientations and sizes of sample mountings. The thesis also reports studies on interactions between produced blast waves and various structures, for both biological sample mounting and blast mitigation purpose. It shows that the shock tube system can allow studies of blast effects on biological samples (e. g. osteoblast and Schwann cell cultures), and blast mitigating properties of different materials and structures (e. g. perforated sheets, reticulated foams). Finally, a computational fluid dynamic simulation for the blast generation in the shock tube has been developed, which gives reasonable agreements with experimental data. Improved versions of the simulation will be coupled with structural program to model interactions between blast waves and different geometries and materials. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The ram {{accelerator}} is a hypervelocity launcher with direct space launch applications {{in which a}} sub-caliber projectile, analogous to the center-body of a ramjet engine, flies through fuel and oxidizer that have been premixed in a tube. Shock interactions in the tube ignite the propellant upon entrance of the projectile and the combustion travels with it, creating thrust on the projectile by stabilizing a high pressure region of gas behind it. Conventional {{ram accelerator}} projectiles consist of aluminum, magnesium, or titanium nosecones and bodies. An experimental program has been undertaken to determine the performance of polycarbonate projectiles in ram accelerator operation. Experimentation using polycarbonate projectiles has been divided into two series: determining the lower limit for starting velocity (i. e., less than 1100 m/s) and investigating the upper velocity limit. To investigate the influence of body length and starting velocity, a newly developed "combustion gun" was used to launch projectiles to their initial velocities. The combustion gun uses 3 - 6 m of ram accelerator test section as a breech and 4 - 6 m of the ram accelerator test section as a launch tube. A fuel-oxidizer mix is combusted in the breech using a spark plug or electric match and <b>bursts</b> a <b>diaphragm,</b> accelerating the ram projectile to its entrance velocity. The combustion gun can be operated at modest fill pressures (20 bar) but can only launch to relatively low velocities (approximately 1000 m/s) without destroying the projectile and obturator upon launch. Projectiles were successfully started at entrance velocities as low as 810 m/s and projectile body lengths as long as 91 mm were used. The tests investigating the upper Mach number limits of polycarbonate projectiles used the conventional single-stage light-gas gun because {{of its ability to}} reach higher velocities with a lower acceleration launch.

40|$|Hydrogen is {{considered}} as a future fuel which may replace traditional ones. There are several arguments for utilization of the hydrogen : high heat of combustion, zero CO(2) emission, etc. But there are also significant disadvantages : low density, high cost of production and safety problems. Nowadays, hydrogen, used in vehicles, can be stored at pressure up to 70 MPa, but high pressure discharge of the hydrogen into atmosphere can cause spontaneous ignition, so a failure of any element of high pressure hydrogen installation generates hazard of potential fire and explosion.

Although 5 -HT affects respiratory drive to both phrenic and cranial motoneurons, relatively {{little is known about}} the role of 5 -HT receptor subtypes in the control of upper airway muscle (UAM) respiratory activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we performed central injections of 5 -HT 1 A agonist (8 -OHDPAT) or antagonist (WAY 100635) in anesthetized rats and analyzed changes in the electromyographic activity of several UAM and other cardiorespiratory parameters. We also compared the pattern of Fos expression induced after central injection of a control solution or 8 -OHDPAT. RESULTS: Results showed that 8 -OHDPAT induced a robust increase in UAM activity, associated with either tachypnea under volatile anesthesia or bradypnea under liquid anesthesia. Injection of WAY 100635 switched off UAM respiratory activity and led to bradypnea, suggesting a tonic excitatory role of endogenous 5 -HT 1 A receptor activation. Co-injection of the agonist and the antagonist blocked the effects produced by each drug alone. Besides drug-induced changes in respiratory frequency, only slight increases in surface of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>bursts</b> were observed. Significant increases in Fos expression after 5 -HT 1 A receptor activation were seen in the nucleus tractus solitarius, nucleus raphe pallidus, parapyramidal region, retrotrapezoid nucleus, lateral parabrachial, and Kölliker-Fuse nuclei. This restricted pattern of Fos expression likely identified the neural substrate responsible for the enhancement of UAM respiratory activity observed after 8 -OHDPAT injection. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an important role for the 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the neural control of upper airway patency and may be relevant to counteract pharyngeal atonia during obstructive sleep apneas...|$|R

40|$|A dust is {{classified}} as explosible based on the laboratory tests specified by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E 1226. This standard requires that a dust be uniformly dispersed into an enclosed 20 -Liter (L) chamber forming a dust cloud; a 10, 000 Joule (10 kJ) flame is subsequently forced through the dust cloud and the resulting pressure rise is measured. If the pressure rise exceeds one bar (14. 5 psig), {{it is assumed that}} a deflagration occurred, and the dust {{is classified}} as class ?A? explosible dust. We have reported several flaws in the current ASTM testing protocols. The only indicator used by the ASTM method for assuming a deflagration had occurred in the test chamber is pressure rise. CAAQES has developed an alternative protocol that more accurately characterizes the explosibility of dusts. The CAAQES protocol for determining MEC is to test a wide range of concentrations of a dust in a 28. 3 -L (1 ft^(3)) Plexiglas chamber with a diaphragm and a stationary ignition source. If a self-propagating flame results as indicated by the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>bursting,</b> the Pressure vs. Time curve, and the flame leaving the chamber, a deflagration occurred during the test and the dust is explosible. Several dusts were tested along with cotton gin dust (CGD) for explosibility. The CGD does not have a MEC and hence it is non-explosible, contrary to the results reported by the Safety Consulting Engineers Inc. (SEC Inc.). The SCE Inc. tested CGD for explosibility based on the ASTM E 1226 standard and reported CGD as class ?A? explosible dust. The difference in test results triggered a research on characterizing a dust for explosibility by the CAAQES. The MECs of dusts were reported and compared with the MECs determined by Palmer in 1973 and the U. S. Bureau of Mines in 1964. Further studies were also conducted to determine the dust properties affecting the explosibility of a dust. The CGD consisted of 87 % inerts with a low energy content of 1400 J g^(- 1). The properties of CGD rendered it non-explosible. Dusts were mixed with Fuller?s earth and tested in the CAAQES chamber in order to study the effect of inert mass fraction of a dust on MECs. It was hypothesized that, at a specific concentration, the distance between the combustible particles must be at a certain distance to enable a flame to propagate from one particle to another. The distance between the combustible particles should be 450 to 700 m to propagate the flame from one particle to another in the CAAQES chamber. Approximately, 50 % of inerts (Fuller?s earth) prevented a deflagration for all dusts. The energy content of agricultural dusts should be above 7000 J g^(- 1) to result in a deflagration. It was also concluded that the dust properties influences the explosibility of a dust...|$|R

In this work, experimental studies have been carried out to explore the use of the shock tube technique for generating air shock waves that mimic the temporal and spatial characteristics of free-field blast waves and to investigate the blast wave-test sample interactions in such a simulated blast experiment. To facilitate the studies, new data acquisition and analysis systems for shock tube experiments were developed along with LabVIEW-based software. Techniques for proper mounting of piezoelectric sensors in square shock tubes were also worked out. Evolutions of the blast waves simulated with a 9 -inch square shock tube inside and outside the tube were then investigated by placing a metal cylinder instrumented with piezoelectric sensor array at various locations of interest. The results show that the temporal and spatial characteristics of free-field blast waves can only be replicated deep inside the tube. The lateral expansion as the shock front exits the tube causes unwanted premature release in part of the tube near the exit and complex three-dimensional flow which evolves quickly into subsonic jet flow outside the exit. Motivated by the results, a 28 -inch square shock tube adequate for in-tube full scale head/helmet model testing was developed along with a catch tank for blast energy mitigation and noise reduce. Its modular configuration was optimized for best efficiency. Correlations of the peak shock pressure and the positive impulse with the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>burst</b> pressure were determined for various configurations. Accurate (Friedlander) blast wave profiles were obtained for peak pressures from 5. 5 to 42 psi and for positive durations from 4 to 9. 25 ms. The interactions between the blast waves simulated with the 9 -inch shock tube and cylindrical polycarbonate tubes filled with a mineral oil as idealized two-dimensional skull-brain models were then studied. The results indicate that the sample geometry causes flow separation from lateral surfaces and thus large surface pressure gradients and lateral underpressure pulses as the blast wave engulfs the sample. While the sample front and then the back are compressed, parts of it expand with the underpressure pulses. Such a deformation and the subsequent recovery/oscillation dictate the internal pressure response, which oscillates with multiple full releases and even reversals to underpressure and therefore is temporally different from the pressure wave impinging on the sample front. A thicker shell may reverse from lateral elliptic to front-back elliptic under higher loadings. This can cause cavitations at the front and back walls. These findings have provided, for the first time, experimental measurements of the dynamic response of fluid-filled cylinders (simplified skull-brain models) subjected to blast wave loading.

40|$|Experiments in {{the study}} of {{transient}} aerodynamics typically require pressure measurements with a high spatial and temporal resolution. Existing commercial pressure transducers are expensive and they provide a spatial resolution only on the order of millimetres. The full bandwidth of commercial devices (which extends to around 200 kHz) can only be utilised by exposing the transducer to the flow environment with very little thermal or mechanical protection. If insufficient protection is provided, the expensive commercial devices are likely to be damaged. Inexpensive pressure sensors based on extrinsic Fabry-Perot fibre optic interferometry are capable of measurement with a high spatial and temporal resolution. Thermal protection or isolation for these sensors is still required, but they can be exposed directly to the flow if the sensors are disposable (low cost). Excessive thermal or mechanical protection is not required for these sensors because the damaging heat transfer and particle impacts that may occur in transient aerodynamic facilities generally occur after the useful test flow. In this dissertation, a variety of construction techniques for diaphragm-based Fabry-Perot fibre optic pressure sensors were investigated and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} all techniques are compared. The results indicate that using a zirconia ferrule as the substrate, a liquid adhesive as the bonding layer, and a polished copper foil as the diaphragm provide the best results. It is demonstrated that a spatial resolution on the order of 0. 1 mm and a bandwidth to more than 100 kHz can be achieved with such constructions. A variety of problems such as hysteresis, response irregularity, low visibility and sensor non-repeatability were observed. By using a thinner bonding layer, a larger bonding area, longer cavity length, increased calibration period, and applying load cycling to the diaphragm, the hysteresis was minimized. Sensor response irregularity was also minimized using a polished diaphragm. Visibility increased to about 90 % using active control of the cavity length during the construction process. Non-repeatability was found to be a consequence of adhesive viscoelasticity and this effect was minimized using a thin layer of adhesive to bond the diaphragm to the substrate. Due to the effects of adhesive viscoelasticity, the pressure sensors indicate an error of up to 10 % of mean value for the reflected shock pressure. This error could not be further reduced in the current sensors configuration. Some new configurations are proposed to decrease the effect of sensor non-repeatability. The effect of pretensioning the diaphragm was investigated analytically but the results do not indicate any considerable advantage for the levels of pretension likely to be achieved in practice. However, the results do indicate that pretension effects caused by an environmental temperature change can damage the sensor during storage. The effect of the initial diaphragm deflection on the sensor performance and temperature sensitivity was modelled and the results show that an initial diaphragm deflection can improve the sensor performance. The effect of the thermal isolation layer on the sensor performance was also investigated and the results show that for a shock tube <b>diaphragm</b> <b>bursting</b> pressure ratio up to 5. 7, heat transfer does not contribute to sensor errors for the first millisecond after shock reflection. However, it was found that the use of a thin layer of low viscosity grease can protect the sensor for about 20 ms while only decreasing its natural frequency by typically 17 %. The grease layer was also found to decrease the settling time of a low damping ratio sensor by 40 %. The sensor was successfully employed to identify an acoustic disturbance in a shock tube...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the suitabiiity of {{ground-based}} faciiities for simulating the iiow and combustion in scramjets has been carried out. A wind tunnei model was developed for the HEG from the HyShot flight test model, which recreated the internal geometry at a scale of 1 : 1. The model was split into two engines, which were instrumented with pressure transducers and thermocouples. A fuei injection system injected cold gaseous hydrogen into the flow through portholes in the wall of one combustion chamber. The model was tested at various angles of attack and equivalence ratios and testing with a nitrogen freestream was used to quantify the effect of fuel injection without combustion. in this study, ZFD and shock tunnel experiments have been performed, these then being compared with the flight test data from the HyShot I 1 flight. Two new conditions for the HEG were designed analytically and refined using the one-dimensional Lagrangian code i i D and experimentally-determined efficiency coefficients, aiiowing the dennition of a new condition with a maximum of two tests in the HEG. A new Mach 7. 8 contoured nozzle was calibrated and a new piston with a braking system to prevent reverse movement after <b>diaphragm</b> <b>burst</b> was designed and tested. - 1 I ne engine pressures without combustion in the HEG agreed well with theory and CFD. Measurements with thermocouples in the HEG showed boundary layer transition in the combustion chamber between Reynolds numbers of 6 12000 and 782000. ivieasurements {{of the position of}} the initiation of combustion in the HEG showed that it was a function of mixing only and was independent of the combustion kinetics. Formation of a stable boundary layer separation on the cowl in the combustion chamber was observed for tests at higher equivalence ratio and angle of attack. The size of the separation was observed to increase with increasing equivalence ratio, angle of attack and wall temperature, and with decreasing freestream pressure. The expansion corner attached to the cowl reduced the size of the subsonic region, allowing separation to occur without choking the engine. The flight data was analysed at 27. 5 km and 32. 4 km altitude, corresponding to the experimental conditions in the HEG. In the HyShot I 1 flight, the combustion chamber pressures without combustion were 30 % and 40 % higher than expected at 32. 4 km and 27. 5 km altitude respectively. It has been shown that failure of the top and bottom tips of the combustion chamber was not responsible, but that failure of the side tips of the combustion chamber or a hysteresis in the iniet from higher altitudes couid not be ruled out as the source of the pressure discrepancy. The fuel-on flight data at 28 km altitude had a large separated region and the data at and 3. 53 " angle of attack agreed well with that taken in the HEG at Condition XI and 6. 0 " angle of attack. Experiments suggested that the fuel-on fiight data at 33 km altitude had only small separated regions, but the elevated pressure in the combustion chamber before combustion, prevented good agreement with the HEG data. - 1 I nis work has demonstrated that the supersonic combustion and boundary iayer separation in a mixing-limited scramjet can be accurateiy simulated in a shock tunnel at an enthalpy of 3 MJIkg...|$|R
