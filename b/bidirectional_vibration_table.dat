The horizontally moving part was driven by a Leonald motor of 1 H. P. and the vertically moving part by a three phase commutator shunt motor of 1 / 2 H. P. In the present case, no spring was fitted between the motor driving system and moving table for the vertical vibration and also for the horizontal vibration, as the result of which the ranges suited to practical use could be made fairly wide. Experimental tests of the table showed that although the horizontal and vertical amplitudes remain constant for any exciting frequency in vertical motion, the same amplitudes change with differences in the frequency of the horizontal motion. At all events, {{it was found that the}} practical range of vibrational frequency in the horizontal sense was from one to ten per second and that in vertical sense from one to five per second. In the present case no damper was used. Were an effective damper added, the range of frequency to be applied would be much wider...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{introduction}} of Highly Accelerated Life Testing (HALT) in a multinational corporation as part of a reliability improvement process for printed circuit boards (PCBs). More specifically, the thesis focuses on drafting a standard operating procedure (SOP) to standardize the fixture setup process so as to minimize variation in vibrational responses attributed to fixture setup. This study proposes a three phase approach to meet the objective. The first phase aims to minimize variation in the gauges and the <b>vibration</b> <b>table.</b> A gauge repeatability and reproducibility (gauge R&R) test is conducted on two triaxial accelerometers to determine the most suitable gauge for HALT. Next, a spatial uniformity test is conducted on the <b>vibration</b> <b>table</b> using design of experiments (DOE) method to determine the region with the most consistent vibration levels for testing. The second phase aims to reduce variation in fixture usage by introducing a generic fixture design base on fixture design principles. The last phase involves proposing a short-run statistical process control (SPC) method to detect setup variability. The results from the gauge R&R test show that mechanically mounted accelerometers have the least gauge variance. Using an SOP, switching from wax-mounting to threaded stud-mounting reduces gauge variance by approximately 90 %. However, wax-mounted accelerometers are still relevant for measuring vibrational responses from PCBs due to its non-invasive properties. The drawback will be that the gauge becomes a key contributor to measurement variation. The spatial uniformity test reveals that the center of the <b>vibration</b> <b>table</b> has the least variation and is selected for the fixture setup. Further limitations on the HALT chamber are highlighted. Evaluation on the proposed generic fixture demonstrates that the fixture has met the key design criteria and manage to induce consistent failures to the PCBs. Limitations on the fixture design are also considered. The proposed SPC method is able to detect at least 88 % of the assignable sources of variation in a simulation test. Finally, a custom SOP for the fixture setup is drafted for the company. by Dexter Chew Xuan Han. Thesis: M.

40|$|Abstract. During the {{transportation}} {{phase of the}} distribution cycle, packaging systems are subjected to random dynamic compressive loads that arise from vibrations generated by the vehicle. The level and severity of these dynamic compressive loads are generally {{a function of the}} vibration levels, the stack configuration and stack weight. The container’s ability to withstand these compressive loads for sufficiently long periods depends on the material’s characteristics as well as the container design. The research presented herein tests the hypothesis that cumulative damage in the material under random dynamic compression will result in a reduction in the overall stiffness as well as an increase in the overall damping of the element. These are expected to be manifested, respectively, as a shift in the fundamental resonant frequency as well as an increase in the bandwidth of the frequency response function of the material at resonance when configured as a single degree of freedom system. The paper presents the results of preliminary experiments in which a number of corrugated paperboard samples were subjected to dynamic compressive loads by means of broad-band random base excitation with a <b>vibration</b> <b>table</b> coupled with a guided dead-weight arrangement. The level of cumulative damage in the sample was continuously evaluated by monitoring the stiffness and overall damping of the sample which were extracted from the Frequency Response Function (FRF) of the system.

For this purpose, a multi-axial vibration test facility was utilized. A typical passenger seat with test dummies was mounted on the <b>vibration</b> <b>table.</b> All six axes of the <b>vibration</b> <b>table</b> were excited with three levels of sine sweep and random excitation signals. The responses at specific positions on the test dummy were measured. The transmissibility FRF were computed with two approaches. First, the response signals were related to the respective excitation axis. Second, an improved approach was used which takes into account the motions of all base axes. Both approaches delivered transmissibility FRF which were nearly identical. However, in most cases the transmissibility FRF, which were computed with the improved approach, were more noisy. The reason for this might be the spill-over effect of some cross-talk motions. An investigation of possible nonlinear effects showed that an increase of the excitation level of the sine sweep excitation resulted in a shift of the resonance peaks to lower frequencies and a reduction of the resonance amplitudes. The verification of computational models should therefore be mainly accomplished with data of the low level, if the models are assumed to be linear. Medium and high levels of sine sweep excitation should only be used for the verification of nonlinear models...|$|R
