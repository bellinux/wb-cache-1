500|$|The raid {{did not go}} as planned. Standard {{procedure}} was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women {{to the bathroom to}} verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room {{in the back of the}} bar. Maria Ritter, then known as Steve to her family, recalled, [...] "My <b>biggest</b> <b>fear</b> was that I would get arrested. My second <b>biggest</b> <b>fear</b> was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!"

500|$|Disney {{decided to}} release the film under their Touchstone Pictures banner because they thought the film would be [...] "too dark and scary for kids", Selick remembered. [...] "Their <b>biggest</b> <b>fear,</b> and why {{it was kind of}} a stepchild project, [...] they were afraid of their core {{audience}} hating the film and not coming." [...] To convey Burton's' involvement and attract a wider audience, Disney marketed the film as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Burton explained that,"...it turned more into more of a brand-name thing, it turned into something else, which I'm not quite sure about." [...] The film premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, and was given a limited release on October 15, 1993, before its wide theatrical release on October 29.|$|E

And the second stuff we shot in a big huge tank where we filmed all the underwater sequence, that was in a 93° pool," [...] Landes clarified. Cook and Landes performed their own stunts in both sequences. [...] "My <b>biggest</b> <b>fear</b> is being trapped in a car underwater. So it was kind of cool to face my fear and all that," [...] Cook divulged. [...] "We took a couple of lessons with a scuba guide to be comfortable being underwater and breathing off the regulator," [...] Landes enunciated.|$|E

In a video interview, Bethe stated that his choice of 8 kt was exactly the value calculated by Segrè, and he was swayed by Segrè's authority over that of a more junior [...] member of Segrè's group who had calculated 20 kt. Enrico Fermi offered to take wagers among the top physicists and military present on whether the atmosphere would ignite, and if so whether it would destroy just the state, or incinerate the entire planet. This last result had been previously calculated by Bethe to be almost impossible, although {{for a while it}} had caused some of the scientists some anxiety. Bainbridge was furious with Fermi for scaring the guards who, unlike the physicists, did not have the advantage of their knowledge about the scientific possibilities. His own <b>biggest</b> <b>fear</b> was that nothing would happen, in which case he would have to head back to the tower to investigate.|$|E
500|$|Jon Snow {{was killed}} in the fifth-season finale, [...] "Mother's Mercy", and in the lead up to the sixth season, actor Kit Harington, who portrays the character, stated {{that he would not be}} {{returning}} to the series except to play a corpse, and would not be resurrected despite rampant speculation. Following the airing of [...] "Home", Harington issued a public apology to fans of the show, stating that he would [...] "like to say sorry for lying to everyone. I'm glad that people were upset that he died. I think my <b>biggest</b> <b>fear</b> was that people were not going to care. Or it would just be, 'Fine, Jon Snow's dead.' But it seems like people had a, similar to the Red Wedding episode, kind of grief about it. Which means something I'm doing — or the show is doing — is right." [...] Harington was simply referred to as [...] "LC", for Lord Commander, in all scripts, call sheets, props or wardrobe materials, in order to maintain the secrecy involved with his eventual resurrection in the episode. It was also revealed that during production of the season, even verbal communication of the name 'Jon Snow' was disallowed, except in on-camera dialogue during actual taping of the series.|$|E
500|$|Sarah Stegall {{proposed}} that the episode works on two separate layers. On the top-most superficial layer, it functions as an outright parody, mimicking both the stylings of The X-Files as well as Cops. However, on the other layer, she notes that [...] "it's a serious look at validation." [...] Throughout the episode, Mulder is attempting to capture the monster on camera and expose it to a national audience. However, all of the witnesses to the monster function as unreliable narrators: a Hispanic woman with [...] "a history of medications", a homosexual [...] "Drama Queen", a prostitute, a [...] "terrified morgue attendant, and Deputy Wetzel. Stegall argues {{that all of these}} characters are from [...] "the wrong side of the tracks" [...] and would not be accepted, let alone believed, by [...] "a placid, middle-class society". In the end, the only reliable witness is the camera, but Stegall points out that [...] "the camera, suspiciously, never quite manages to find [...]" [...] Furthermore, she reasons that Mulder's <b>biggest</b> <b>fear</b> is not finding the monster. To back this idea up, she points out that Mulder not only fails to find what he is looking for, but he also fails before a live audience.|$|E

500|$|Although {{passage in}} the House was less {{controversial}} {{than it was in}} the Senate because the constitutional issues did not dominate consideration, the bill met with other procedural obstacles. At the time, Congress was under siege for what was widely perceived as abuse of members' franking privileges. In April, the House had approved H.R. 3180 to clarify what was and was not proper use of franking, and the Senate amended the bill on October 11. The House requested a conference, but the Senate delayed. Supposedly, Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee Chairman Gale McGee was delaying the franking bill until the Senate-passed post card voter registration bill (...) was put to a House vote. Thus, at first the House inserted franking language in its Saxbe fix bill. On December 3, it suspended its rules to pass the bill 261–129. The Senate then passed the Saxbe fix bill (...) on December 6 without the franking language. The House agreed to the amended bill on December 7. On December 10, Nixon officially submitted the Saxbe nomination. The Judiciary Committee approved Saxbe on December 13 and the full senate confirmed him on December 17 by a 75–10 vote. Ten Democratic senators cited constitutional concerns in opposing this move. Senator Robert C. Byrd, who felt the bar was not avoidable by legislation, explained his position at the time: [...] " [...] so clear that it can't be waived…. We should not delude the American people into thinking a way can be found around the constitutional obstacle." [...] Saxbe did not resign his Senate seat until January 4, 1974, when his wife became eligible for survivor benefits after the completion of his fifth year of service. This delayed his transition to the Cabinet because the Clause expressly prohibits dual service. Saxbe later wrote that although he needed the additional salary he lost (he was earning $42,500 per year as a senator), he was still willing to serve as Attorney General and would get by financially. His <b>biggest</b> <b>fear</b> was that the fix would be ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court several months after he had been in office, and he would have to repay salary already spent.|$|E

2500|$|Webster’s {{dictionary}} (2017) defines infidelity as “unfaithfulness to a moral obligation” (1). Infidelity is the <b>biggest</b> <b>fear</b> in {{most romantic}} relationships and even friendships. No individual {{wants to be}} cheated on and replaced by another, this act usually makes people feel unwanted, jealous, angry and incompetent. The initial stage of the infidelity process is the suspicious beginning; the stage {{in which it has}} not been proven, but warning signs are beginning to surface. The partner being cheated on is noticing changes and becomes suspicious of their partner’s actions. While suspicion is not hard evidence in infidelity and cannot prove anything, it does affect a person’s affective emotions and cognitive states. Jealousy, the feeling of incompetence, and anger can all be felt in both the affective and cognitive states of emotions; infidelity has a different impact in each of those connected states.|$|E
2500|$|Defense {{attorney}} Jose Baez told jurors his <b>biggest</b> <b>fear</b> {{was that}} they would base their verdict on emotions, not evidence.

[...] "Itold you {{at the very beginning of}} this case that this was an accident that snowballed out of control... What made it unique is not what happened, but who it happened to." [...] He explained Casey Anthony's behavior as being the result of her dysfunctional family situation. At one point as Baez spoke, Ashton could be seen smiling or chuckling behind his hand. This prompted Baez to refer to him as [...] "this laughing guy right here". The judge called a sidebar conference, then a recess. When court resumed, he chastised both sides, saying both Ashton and Baez had violated his order that neither side should make disparaging remarks about opposing counsel.

They lie, they avoid, they run, they mislead... they divert attention away from themselves and they act like nothing is wrong."

[...] "Whose life was better without Caylee?"

[...] "That's the only question you need to answer in considering why Caylee Marie Anthony was left {{on the side of the}} road dead."
