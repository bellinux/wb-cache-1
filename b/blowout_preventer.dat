25|$|A ram <b>blowout</b> <b>preventer</b> {{is a large}} valve {{that can}} seal off a {{wellhead}} by using ram-types employing steel cut off rams to seal the borehole. During drilling or well interventions, the valve may be closed if overpressure from an underground zone causes formation fluids such as oil or natural gas to enter the wellbore and threaten the rig. In 1922, James Smither Abercrombie collaborated with Harry S. Cameron {{with the idea of}} creating a mechanically operated ram-type <b>blowout</b> <b>preventer.</b> A patent was issued in January 1926.|$|E
25|$|An annular <b>blowout</b> <b>preventer</b> {{is a large}} valve {{that uses}} a wedge to seal off a wellhead. It has a donut-like rubber seal, known as an {{elastomeric}} packing unit, reinforced with steel ribs. During drilling or well interventions, the valve may be closed if overpressure from an underground zone causes formation fluids such as oil or natural gas to enter the wellbore and threaten the rig. The annular <b>blowout</b> <b>preventer</b> was invented by Granville Sloan Knox in 1946 who received a patent on September 9, 1952.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blowout</b> <b>preventers</b> were {{developed}} to cope with extreme erratic pressures and uncontrolled flow (formation kick) emanating from a well reservoir during drilling. Kicks {{can lead to a}} potentially catastrophic event known as a blowout. In addition to controlling the downhole (occurring in the drilled hole) pressure and the flow of oil and gas, <b>blowout</b> <b>preventers</b> are intended to prevent tubing (e.g. drill pipe and well casing), tools and drilling fluid from being blown out of the wellbore (also known as bore hole, the hole leading to the reservoir) when a <b>blowout</b> threatens. <b>Blowout</b> <b>preventers</b> are critical to the safety of crew, rig (the equipment system used to drill a wellbore) and environment, and to the monitoring and maintenance of well integrity; thus <b>blowout</b> <b>preventers</b> are intended to provide fail-safety to the systems that include them.|$|R

500|$|Deepwater Horizon was a fifth-generation, RBS-8D design (i.e. model type), deepwater, {{dynamically}} positioned, column-stabilized, semi-submersible mobile {{offshore drilling}} unit, designed to drill subsea wells for oil {{exploration and production}} using an , [...] <b>blowout</b> <b>preventer,</b> and a [...] outside diameter marine riser.|$|E
500|$|During its {{lifetime}} the rig received 5 citations for non-compliance, 4 {{of which}} were in 2002 (safety, including the <b>blowout</b> <b>preventer)</b> {{and the other in}} 2003 (pollution). A sixth citation in 2007 related to non-grounded electrical equipment was later withdrawn when the equipment was determined to be compliant with regulations. Overall the Deepwater Horizon safety record was [...] "strong" [...] according to a drilling consultant reviewing the information. In 2009 the Minerals Management Service [...] "herald the Deepwater Horizon as an industry model for safety". According to AP's investigation [...] "its record was so exemplary, according to MMS officials, that the rig was never on inspectors' informal 'watch list' for problem rigs".|$|E
500|$|At [...] CDT on 20 April 2010, {{during the}} final phases of {{drilling}} the exploratory well at Macondo, a geyser of seawater erupted from the marine riser onto the rig, shooting [...] into the air. [...] This was soon followed by the eruption of a slushy combination of drilling mud, methane gas, and water. The gas component of the slushy material quickly transitioned into a fully gaseous state and then ignited {{into a series of}} explosions and then a firestorm. An attempt was made to activate the <b>blowout</b> <b>preventer,</b> but it failed. The final defense to prevent an oil spill, a device known as a blind shear ram, was activated but failed to plug the well.|$|E
50|$|A blowout is the {{uncontrolled}} {{release of}} crude oil and/or natural gas from an oil well or gas well after pressure control systems have failed. Modern wells have <b>blowout</b> <b>preventers</b> intended to prevent such an occurrence.|$|R
50|$|If the <b>blowout</b> <b>preventers</b> and mud do not {{restrict}} the upward pressures of a kick, a blowout results, potentially shooting tubing, {{oil and gas}} up the wellbore, damaging the rig, and leaving well integrity in question.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Blowout</b> <b>preventers</b> {{are used}} on land wells, {{offshore}} rigs, and subsea wells. Land and subsea BOPs are secured {{to the top}} of the wellbore, known as the wellhead. BOPs on offshore rigs are mounted below the rig deck. Subsea BOPs are connected to the offshore rig above by a drilling riser that provides a continuous pathway for the drill string and fluids emanating from the wellbore. In effect, a riser extends the wellbore to the rig. Unfortunately, <b>blowout</b> <b>preventers</b> do not always function correctly. An example of this is the Deepwater Horizon blowout, where the pipe line going through the BOP was slightly bent and the BOP failed to cut the pipe.|$|R

5000|$|The term BOP (pronounced B-O-P, not [...] "bop") {{is used in}} {{oilfield}} vernacular {{to refer}} to blowout preventers. The abbreviated term preventer, usually prefaced by a type (e.g. ram preventer), is {{used to refer to}} a single <b>blowout</b> <b>preventer</b> unit. A <b>blowout</b> <b>preventer</b> may also simply be referred to by its type (e.g. ram).|$|E
50|$|According to the US Congressional investigation, the rig's <b>blowout</b> <b>preventer,</b> a {{fail-safe}} device fitted {{at the base}} of the well, built by Cameron International Corporation, had a hydraulic leak and a failed battery, and therefore failed.

5000|$|The {{generic term}} [...] "squeeze" [...] also {{can apply to}} {{injection}} of generally small volumes of other liquids (e.g., treating fluids) into a zone under pressure.

5000|$|<b>Blowout</b> <b>Preventers</b> often {{contain a}} stack of independently-operated cutoff mechanisms, so there is {{redundancy}} in case of failure, {{and the ability to}} work in all normal circumstances with the drill pipe in or out of the well bore. The BOP used in the Deepwater Horizon, for example, had five [...] "rams" [...] and two [...] "annular" [...] <b>blowout</b> <b>preventers.</b> [...] The rams were of two types: [...] "pipe rams" [...] and [...] "shear rams". If the drill pipe is in the well, the pipe rams slide perpendicular to the pipe, closing around it to form a tight seal. The annular preventers also close around the pipe, but have more of a vertical motion, so they loosen slightly if the drill pipe is being pushed downward, as might be necessary in a [...] "snubbing" [...] or [...] "well kill" [...] operation. [...] Shear rams may be used as a last resort to cut through the drill pipe and shut off everything, including whatever might be coming up inside the drill pipe.|$|R

50|$|Shallow water {{drilling}} {{differs from}} deepwater drilling in several key aspects. Shallow water rigs have legs that reach {{the bottom of}} the sea floor and have <b>blowout</b> <b>preventers</b> (BOPs) above the surface of the water that are accessible for inspection, maintenance and repair, and can be controlled either remotely or manually in case of an emergency. Shallow water wells primarily produce natural gas, and are drilled in known areas and mature reservoirs.|$|R
50|$|The {{two main}} causes of a subsea blowout are {{equipment}} failures and imbalances with encountered subsurface reservoir pressure.
