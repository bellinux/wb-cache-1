5000|$|<b>Balsam</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tolu</b> and Balsam of Peru (Myroxylon balsamum) are {{sometimes}} called opobalsamum and {{are sometimes}} substituted for it, however {{they are not}} the true C. opobalsamum. The balsams have a sweet, aromatic, resinous scent with an odour resembling vanilla or benzoin. Both <b>Balsam</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tolu</b> and Balsam of Peru come from the same tree, Myroxylon, but each differs in production. The word Myroxylon is literally [...] "fragrant wood" [...] in Greek, or Quina/Balsamo. The balsams substitute for opobalsamum which some believe to be Stacte.|$|E

40|$|Balsams {{have been}} used since ancient times, due to their {{therapeutic}} and healing properties; in the perfume industry, they are used as fixatives, and in the cosmetics industry and in cookery, they are used as preservatives and aromatizers. They are generally defined as vegetable material with highly aromatic properties that supposedly {{have the ability to}} heal diseases, not only of the body, but also of the soul. When viewed according to this concept, many substances can be considered balsams. A more modern concept is based on its chemical composition and origin: a secretion or exudate of plants that contain cinnamic and benzoic acids, and their derivatives, in their composition. The most common naturally-occurring balsams (i. e. true balsams) are the Benzoins, Liquid Storaque and the <b>Balsams</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tolu</b> and Peru. Many other aromatic exudates, such as Copaiba Oil and Canada Balsam, are wrongly called balsam. These usually belong to other classes of natural products, such as essential oils, resins and oleoresins. Despite the understanding of some plants, many plants are still called balsams. This article presents a chemical and pharmacological review of the most common balsams...|$|R
50|$|It is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C6H5CH2O2CC6H5. It is the ester of benzyl alcohol and benzoic acid.

5000|$|... ===Balsam=== Groom defines balsam {{as simply}} as “a viscious, {{resinous}} exudation from certain trees and shrubs, with a consistency which is thick but not solid. The principle balsams used in modern perfumery are Balsam of Peru, <b>Balsam</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tolu,</b> Balsam of Copaiba, Storax and Balm of Gilead opobalsamum. They {{have in common}} a vanilla like odor. The words Balsam and Balm are often used synonymously.” ...|$|E
5000|$|As stated above,some use <b>Balsam</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tolu</b> and Peru as a {{substitute}} for opobalsamum (Balm of Gilead), which they believe is the original Stacte, because of the similarity of scent (opobalsamum is in the commiphora or the myrrh family). Groom describes the scent of these balsams as vanilla like and referring to Styrax benzoin he says “the resin from it has a storax-like fragrance [...] [...] [...] and has a vanilla-like fragrance.” ...|$|E
50|$|Some resins when soft {{are known}} as 'oleoresins', and when {{containing}} benzoic acid or cinnamic acid they are called balsams. Oleoresins are naturally occurring mixtures of an oil and a resin; they can be extracted from various plants. Other resinous products in their natural condition are a mix with gum or mucilaginous substances and known as gum resins. Several natural resins are used as ingredients in perfumes, e.g., <b>balsams</b> <b>of</b> Peru and <b>tolu,</b> elemi, styrax, and certain turpentines.|$|R
50|$|The genus Myroxylon was {{originally}} described in 1753 by Linnaeus, such description was made using a specimen {{collected in the}} province of Cartagena (at the time Tolú was located {{in the province of}} Cartagena), and named it Toluifera balsamum. The genus Myroxylon was first established by Linnaeus filius in 1781, when he described Myroxylon peruiferum based on a specimen collected by Mutis in South America. Latex from Myroxylon trees is the source <b>of</b> <b>Balsam</b> <b>of</b> Peru and <b>Tolu</b> <b>balsam</b> (which differ in production) and composition.|$|R
5000|$|The {{portion of}} the Cordillera del Bálsamo (Balsam Mountain Range) that sits in the Municipality has an average {{elevation}} of 1030 m above sea level. The Cordillera del Bálsamo is named after the Myroxylon balsamum tree, one of two species of Central American and South American trees in the Fabaceae family (Leguminosae). The tree, often called Quina or Bálsamo, {{is well known in}} the western world as the source <b>of</b> <b>Balsam</b> <b>of</b> Peru and <b>Tolu</b> <b>balsam.</b> El Salvador is the main exporter of these resins, which are still extracted manually.|$|R
5000|$|The {{compound}} {{was first}} isolated in 1837 through a distillation of pine oil by a Polish chemist named Filip Walter, who named it rétinnaphte. [...] In 1841, French chemist Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville isolated a hydrocarbon from <b>balsam</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tolu</b> (an aromatic extract from the tropical Colombian tree Myroxylon balsamum), which Deville recognized as similar to Walter's rétinnaphte and to benzene; hence {{he called the}} new hydrocarbon benzoène. [...] In 1843, Jöns Jacob Berzelius recommended the name toluin. [...] In 1850, French chemist Auguste Cahours isolated from a distillate of wood a hydrocarbon which he recognized as similar to Deville's benzoène and which Cahours named toluène.|$|E

However, {{he was not}} the only one in the 16 th to search for other varieties of balsamic oleoresins.

5000|$|... "Balsam of Peru" [...] is a misnomer. [...] In {{the early}} period of Spanish {{dominion}} in Central and South America, the balsam was collected in Central America {{and shipped to}} Callao and Lima in Peru, then shipped onward to Europe. [...] It acquired the name of [...] "Peru" [...] because it was shipped from there. [...] Its export to Europe was first documented {{in the seventeenth century}} in the German Pharmacopedia. Today it is extracted under a handicraft process, and is mainly exported from El Salvador.There are two balsams obtained from Myroxylon sp. trees, <b>Balsam</b> <b>of</b> Peru and <b>Tolu</b> <b>Balsam</b> (not [...] "Balsam of tolú"). [...] "Balsam of Peru" [...] and [...] "Balsam of Tolu" [...] are produced in different way, see Myroxylon. [...] "Tolu Balsam" [...] is Not misnomer, it is rather a toponymy since the balsam was actually obtained from the latex of a tree originally described by Linnaeus as Toluifera balsamum later known as Myroxilon balsamum. In 1753 Linnaeus described the type specimen of Toluifera balsamum using a specimen collected in the province of Cartagena, probably a town called Tolú, which at the time was located in the province of Cartagena, and named it Toluifera balsamum in relation to the place of collection. In ecological terms, Tolu region can be described, according to Holddrige classification as Tropical Dry Forest, which is home to Myroxylon sp. trees.|$|R

40|$|What is <b>Balsam</b> <b>of</b> Peru {{and where}} is it found? <b>Balsam</b> <b>of</b> Peru is a sticky {{aromatic}} liquid that comes from cutting the bark of the tree Myroxolon balsamum, a tree that is native to El Salvador. The "Peru " part <b>of</b> <b>Balsam</b> <b>of</b> Peru originates from {{when it was first}} named, El Salvador then being part of a Peruvian colony. <b>Balsam</b> <b>of</b> Peru smells of vanilla and cinnamon because it contains 60 - 70 % cinnamein (a combination of cinnamic acid, cinnamyl cinnamate, benzyl benzoate, benzoic acid and vanillin). The other 30 - 40 % contains resins of unknown composition. It also contains essential oils similar to those in citrus fruit peel. These are all potential allergens. <b>Balsam</b> <b>of</b> Peru is not only used for its aromatic and fixative (i. e. delays evaporation) properties but also for its mild antibacterial, antifungal and antiparasitic attributes. It has 3 main uses: fragrance in perfumes and toiletries; flavouring in food and drink; healing properties in medicinal products.
