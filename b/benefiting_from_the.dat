5|$|In 1989, the Internal Revenue Service began {{investigating}} the Reagans over allegations they owed additional {{tax on the}} gifts and loans of high-fashion clothes and jewelry to the First Lady during {{their time in the}} White House (recipients <b>benefiting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> display of such items recognize taxable income even if they are returned). In 1992, the IRS determined the Reagans had failed to include some $3 million worth of fashion items between 1983 and 1988 on their tax returns; they were billed for a large amount of back taxes and interest, which was subsequently paid.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to deceiving the French, the Rwandan government used the fake attack on Kigali on 4 October as the pretext for launching {{a wave of}} anti-Tutsi propaganda. They encouraged Hutu citizens to arrest Tutsi suspected of supporting the RPF. With French assistance, and <b>benefiting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> loss of RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the FAR enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF, and pushed the rebels {{all the way back}} to the Ugandan border. Many soldiers deserted; some crossed back into Uganda, while others went into hiding in the Akagera National Park. The Rwandan government announced on 30 October that the war was over.|$|E

5|$|Kagame {{returned}} to Africa and took {{command of the}} RPF forces, which {{had been reduced to}} fewer than 2,000 troops. Kagame and his soldiers moved west, through Uganda, to the Virunga Mountains, a rugged high-altitude area where the terrain worked in their favor. From there he re-armed and reorganized the army, and carried out fundraising and recruitment from the Tutsi diaspora. Kagame restarted combat in January 1991, with an attack on the northern town of Ruhengeri. <b>Benefiting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> element of surprise, the RPF captured the town and held it for a day before retreating back into the forests.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species are}} generalist predators, eating microalgae, sponges, bivalves, snails {{and other small}} animals. The crown-of-thorns starfish consumes coral polyps, while other species are detritivores, feeding on decomposing organic {{material}} and faecal matter. A few are suspension feeders, gathering in phytoplankton; Henricia and Echinaster often occur in association with sponges, <b>benefiting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> water current they produce. Various species {{have been shown to}} be able to absorb organic nutrients from the surrounding water, and this may form a significant portion of their diet.|$|E

His family's wealth enabled him to attend the independent St Peter's School, York. Such wealth had arisen after Terry's of York had advantageously relocated to St Helen's Square, in the centre of York, with business <b>benefiting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> City's intake of 30,000 shoppers and tourists daily as a result of significant developments in rail travel.|$|E

Wood ants share the same habitat as the treecreeper, and also feed on invertebrates on tree trunks. The Finnish researchers found that where the ants have been foraging, there are fewer arthropods, and male treecreepers spent a shorter time on spruce trunks visited by ants.|$|E
5|$|In April 2001, {{while he}} was on parole, a Los Angeles police officer found him {{wandering}} barefoot in Culver City, just outside Los Angeles. He was arrested for suspicion of being under the influence of drugs, but was released a few hours later, even though tests showed he had cocaine in his system. After this last arrest, producer David E. Kelley and other Ally McBeal executives ordered last-minute rewrites and reshoots and dismissed Downey from the show, despite the fact that Downey's character had resuscitated Ally McBeals ratings. The Culver City arrest also cost him a role in the high-profile film America's Sweethearts, and the subsequent incarceration forced Mel Gibson to shut down his planned stage production of Hamlet, as well. In July 2001, Downey pleaded no contest to the Palm Springs charges, avoiding jail time. Instead, he was sent into drug rehabilitation and put on a three-year probation, <b>benefiting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> California Proposition 36, which had been passed the year before with the aim of helping nonviolent drug offenders overcome their addictions instead of sending them to jail.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Aarhus is {{predominantly}} knowledge and service based, {{strongly influenced by}} the University of Aarhus and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing. Trade and transportation remain important sectors <b>benefiting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> large port and central position on the rail network. Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality. The municipality is home to 175,000 jobs with some 100,000 {{in the private sector}} and the rest split between state, region and municipality. The region is a major agricultural producer, with many large farms in the outlying districts. People commute to Aarhus {{from as far away as}} Randers, Silkeborg and Skanderborg and almost a third of those employed within Aarhus municipality commute from neighbouring communities. Aarhus is a centre for retail in the Nordic and Baltic countries with expansive shopping centres, the busiest commercial street in the country and a dense urban core with many speciality shops.|$|E

5|$|At the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Criterion Games' {{director}} of design Alex Ward {{was approached by}} Bruce McMillan, executive vice president at EA Worldwide Studios. McMillan wanted to reconcile EA's relationship with Criterion and partner with them on a game. Initially, Ward refused, citing their past experience {{of working with the}} publisher. However, EA persisted and suggested Criterion make Burnout 3 with them. Originally, the studio was waiting until the next generation of video game hardware launched before starting work on a third instalment. Criterion accepted the deal on the conditions that EA would not interfere with the game's development and that Criterion had the freedom to create the game they wanted. Development on Burnout 3 began immediately after the expo in June 2003, with a larger team of staff working on the game than its predecessors. By January 2004, Criterion had a build of the game ready to demonstrate to EA. The development team had drafted a number of subtitles for Burnout 3 including Fuel Injection, Crash and Burn, Seek and Destroy, Takedown along with some more ridiculous suggestions like See You in Hell. Internally, they felt that Takedown was not an appealing choice, however the outcome of EA's focus testing proved otherwise. Despite a rocky start in their relationship with EA, Criterion admitted to <b>benefiting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> publisher's experience throughout the course of Burnout 3s development. By July 2004, development on the game was nearly complete with the remaining work confined to bug testing and polishing the experience. On 28 July 2004, EA announced that they had acquired Criterion along with the Burnout intellectual property. McMillan stated that their strong expectations for Burnout 3 and ownership of the series were key reasons for buying Criterion.|$|E
