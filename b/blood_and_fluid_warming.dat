50|$|Retained blood {{syndrome}} (RBS) {{results from}} the ineffective evacuation of <b>blood</b> <b>and</b> <b>fluid</b> from a surgical or traumatic wound after surgery. This can happen after nearly any operation or major trauma, but especially operations like heart surgery, thoracic surgery, trauma surgery, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, pelvic surgery or plastic surgery. In nearly all of these specialties, surgical drains are needed to remove <b>blood</b> <b>and</b> <b>fluid</b> from the surgical wounds in the early phase of recovery. RBS can develop when these drains fail to perform the required task that is to drain <b>blood,</b> <b>fluid,</b> <b>and</b> air from the surgical wound.|$|R

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the incidence rate of reported occupational <b>blood</b> <b>and</b> body <b>fluid</b> exposures among French healthcare workers (HCWs). DESIGN: Prospective national follow-up of HCWs from January 1 to December 31, 2004. SETTING: University hospitals, hospitals, clinics, local medical centers, and specialized psychiatric centers {{were included in}} the study on a voluntary basis. PARTICIPANTS: At participating medical centers, every reported <b>blood</b> <b>and</b> body <b>fluid</b> exposure was documented by the occupational practitioner in charge of the exposed HCW by use of an anonymous, standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 375 medical centers (15 % of French medical centers, accounting for 29 % of hospital beds) reported 13, 041 <b>blood</b> <b>and</b> body <b>fluid</b> exposures; of these, 9, 396 (72. 0 %) were needlestick injuries. <b>Blood</b> <b>and</b> body <b>fluid</b> exposures were avoidable in 39. 1 % of cases (5, 091 of 13, 020), and 52. 2 % of percutaneous injuries (4, 986 of 9, 552) were avoidable (5. 9 % due to needle recapping). Of 10, 656 percutaneous injuries, 22. 6 % occurred during an injection, 17. 9 % during <b>blood</b> sampling, <b>and</b> 16. 6 % during surgery. Of 2, 065 splashes, 22. 6 % occurred during nursing activities, 19. 1 % during surgery, 14. 1 % during placement or removal of an intravenous line, and 12. 0 % during manipulation of a tracheotomy tube. The incidence rates of exposures were 8. 9 per 100 hospital beds (95 % confidence interval [CI], 8. 7 - 9. 0 exposures), 2. 2 per 100 full-time-equivalent physicians (95 % CI, 2. 4 - 2. 6 exposures), and 7. 0 per 100 full-time-equivalent nurses (95 % CI, 6. 8 - 7. 2 exposures). Human immunodeficiency virus serological status was unknown for 2, 789 (21. 4 %) of 13, 041 patients who were the source of the <b>blood</b> <b>and</b> body <b>fluid</b> exposures. CONCLUSION: National surveillance networks for <b>blood</b> <b>and</b> body <b>fluid</b> exposures help to better document their characteristics and risk factors and can enhance prevention at participating medical centers...|$|R

40|$|Objective(s) : The aim of {{this study}} wasto {{investigate}} the effects of mild hypothermia therapy on oxidative stress injury of rabbit brain tissue after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Materials and Methods: Rabbit models of cardiac arrest were established. After the restoration of spontaneous circulation, 50 rabbits were randomly divided into normothermia and hypothermia groups. The following five time points were selected: before CPR, immediately after CPR, 2 hr after CPR (hypothermia group reached the target temperature), 14 hr after CPR (hypothermia group before rewarming), and 24 hr after CPR (hypothermia group recovered to normal temperature). Glutathione (GSH) concentrations in both the <b>blood</b> <b>and</b> cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> of the normothermia and hypothermia groups were measured. Results:At 2, 14, and 24 hr after CPR, the GSH concentrations in both the <b>blood</b> <b>and</b> cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> were significantly higher in the hypothermia group than in the nomorthermia group. Conclusion:Mild hypothermia therapy may increase GSH concentrations in rabbit <b>blood</b> <b>and</b> cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> after CPR as well as promote the recovery of cerebral function...|$|R
