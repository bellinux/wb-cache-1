50|$|Power tools, {{machinery}} and other potentially dangerous equipment is typically manufactured with the right-handed user in mind. Common {{problems faced by}} left-handed operators include the inability to keep materials steady, and difficulty reaching the on/off switch, especially in emergency situations. Table saws, whose blades protrude {{from the top of}} a table and pose the risk of losing fingers or hands, have their cutting area on the right side. This makes it difficult for a left-handed operator to guide the material being cut, as it must be pushed to the right side to align with the fence to avoid kickback. On bandsaws, the <b>blade</b> <b>teeth</b> are {{on the left side of}} the blade, necessitating the material being cut to be pushed from the left side of the machine. However, at this angle, the casing of the machine containing the rest of the blade is on the operator's left side, making it extremely difficult to guide the wood with their left hand.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For {{traditional}} rotary burrs, cutter teeth converge at the vertex, {{which means}} small chip space and poor cutting condition. In {{order to increase}} the chip space and to improve the cutting condition, {{a new type of}} rotary burrs with partition <b>blade</b> <b>teeth,</b> which took the feasibility of the actual process into consideration, was proposed. The curve planning algorithm planned the blade curves on the tooth bottom contour surface, and adjusted the tooth bottom contour model by some parameters, such as the small central angle and the position of oblique planes, to control the contour and blade shape for rotary burrs effectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is part of and continuation of the work {{carried out by the}} author on the Mechanics of Power Hacksawing, on behalf of a hacksaw blade manufacturer. Process parameters which influence the metal. removal rate during power hacksawing have been identified and thus a detailed explanation of the basic sawing mechanism-suggested. Power hacksaw machine characteristics have also been investigated. The problem of blade testing is discussed. A method for assessing the blade performance is proposed which is based on metal removal rate but is independent of the machine characteristics. This could be 'used as a quality index for power hacksaw blades. This performance index is found to vary with workpiece breadth and tooth pitch. A theoretical model is used to give some explanation of this variation. iiowever, there is evidence that the gullet size and goemetry arc, more significant factors influencing the variation in blade performance with changes in the breadth of the workpiece and pitch of the <b>blade</b> <b>teeth.</b> Examinations of saw <b>blade</b> <b>teeth</b> have revealed that they have large cutting edge radii compared to the layer of metal removed, indicating that saw blades are basically blunt tools. The cutting action of tools with large cutting edge radii has been investigated and extensive simulation tests have been undertaken. From the observations of the chip formation mechanism and measurements of the relative position of the tool and machined surface during cutting, some new light is thrown upon the ploughing process. A slip-line field is proposed which qualitatively represents the assumed chip formation mechanism under steady state cutting conditions. The application of an empirical relationship between the chip tool contact length and the undeformed chip thickness in conjunction with the slipline field, provides quantitative correlation with the test results of a single point tool and qualitative correlation with a hacksaw blade. </p...|$|E

Five measurements were taken from each of the 100 saw kerfs to establish an average thickness for each kerf mark. Ten cuts were made on 10 sections of bovine bone, five with human-powered saws and five with mechanical-powered saws. The cuts were examined with a stereoscopic microscope utilizing digital camera measuring software. Two statistical cumulative logistic regression models were used to analyze the saw kerf data collected. In order to estimate the prediction error, repeated stratified cross-validation was applied in analyzing the kerf mark data. Based on the two statistical models used, 70 – 90 % of the saws could be eliminated based on kerf width...|$|E

This mostly concerns precise and ultraprecise machining operations, but also more traditional operations are interested, which are far to be completely optimized in terms of obtainable quality of cut surfaces.

5000|$|Set: The {{degree to}} which the teeth are bent out {{sideways}} away from the blade, usually in both directions. In most modern serrated saws, the teeth are set, so that the kerf (the width of the cut) will be wider than the blade itself. This allows the blade to move through the cut easily without binding (getting stuck). The set may be different depending on the kind of cut the saw is intended to make. For example, a rip saw has a tooth set that is similar to the angle used on a chisel, so that it rips or tears the material apart. A [...] "flush-cutting saw" [...] has no set on one side, so that the saw can be laid flat on a surface and cut along that surface without scratching it.

40|$|In the {{handling}} of bulk metals, it is common practice to use a sawing machine, such as a bandsaw or power hacksaw to reduce the workpiece to a manageable size for downstream processing. Recently, stationary power hacksaws have been replaced with more versatile portable electric reciprocating saws. These machines differ from bandsaws and power hacksaws {{in that they are}} portable, light-weight, and saw by rapidly reciprocating a blade over a short stroke length. In industrial applications, the speed of metal sawing is an important economic factor. The mechanics of metal sawing with traditional machines have been described in the literature, but virtually no research has been published on the mechanics of reciprocating sawing. Research was undertaken to describe metal sawing with reciprocating saws by the application of metal cutting mechanics. Cutting rates of metals with a reciprocating saw are dependent upon several process parameters, such as the applied pressure on the saw, the reciprocating speed of the saw blade, and the geometry of the cutting edges. An analytical model was developed to predict the cutting rate of metals with a reciprocating saw. Particular attention was placed on the sawing rates of steel due to their broad commercial usage. The analytical model for reciprocating sawing rates was compared to empirical studies of important process parameters. A wear model for the cutting edges of saw <b>blade</b> <b>teeth</b> was also derived. Using a Design of Experiments technique, a test matrix was developed to determine the significance of applied thrust force and reciprocating speed on cutting rates of steel.

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the evaluation of the}} generation rate of respirable dust (GAPS, defined as the mass of respirable dust generated per unit linear length cut) from cutting fiber cement siding using different tools in a laboratory testing system. We used an aerodynamic particle sizer spectrometer (APS) to continuously monitor the real-time size distributions of the dust throughout cutting tests when using a variety of tools, and calculated the generation rate of respirable dust for each testing condition using the size distribution data. The test result verifies that power shears provided an almost dust-free operation with a GAPS of 0. 006 g m- 1 at the testing condition. For the same power saws, the cuts using saw <b>blades</b> with more <b>teeth</b> generated more respirable dusts. Using the same blade for all four miter saws tested in this study, a positive linear correlation was found between the saws' blade rotating speed and its dust generation rate. In addition, a circular saw running at the highest blade rotating speed of 9068 rpm generated the greatest amount of dust. All the miter saws generated less dust in the 'chopping mode' than in the 'chopping and sliding' mode. For the tested saws, GAPS consistently decreased with the increases of the saw cutting feed rate and the number of board in the stack. All the test results point out that fewer cutting interactions between the saw <b>blade's</b> <b>teeth</b> and the siding board for a unit linear length of cut tend to result in a lower generation rate of respirable dust. These results may help guide optimal operation in practice and future tool development aimed at minimizing dust generation while producing a satisfactory cut.

40|$|Megaherbivorous dinosaurs were {{exceptionally}} diverse on the Late Cretaceous island {{continent of}} Laramidia, {{and a growing}} body of evidence suggests that this diversity was facilitated by dietary niche partitioning. We test this hypothesis using the fossil megaherbivore assemblage from the Dinosaur Park Formation (upper Campanian) of Alberta as a model. Comparative tooth morphology and wear, including the first use of quantitative dental microwear analysis in the context of Cretaceous palaeosynecology, are used to infer the mechanical properties of the foods these dinosaurs consumed. The phylliform teeth of ankylosaurs were poorly adapted for habitually processing high-fibre plant matter. Nevertheless, ankylosaur diets were likely more varied than traditionally assumed: the relatively large, <b>bladed</b> <b>teeth</b> of nodosaurids would have been better adapted to processing a tougher, more fibrous diet than the smaller, cusp-like teeth of ankylosaurids. Ankylosaur microwear is characterized by a preponderance of pits and scratches, akin to modern mixed feeders, but offers no support for interspecific dietary differences. The shearing tooth batteries of ceratopsids are much better adapted to high-fibre herbivory, attested by their scratch-dominated microwear signature. There is tentative microwear evidence to suggest differences in the feeding habits of centrosaurines and chasmosaurines, but statistical support is not significant. The tooth batteries of hadrosaurids were capable of both shearing and crushing functions, suggestive of a broad dietary range. Their microwear signal overlaps broadly with that of ankylosaurs, and suggests possible dietary differences betwee...|$|R
25|$|Ichthyosaurs were carnivorous. Ichthyosaurs ranged {{so widely}} in size, and survived for so long, {{that they are}} likely to have had a wide range of prey. Species with pointed snouts were adapted to grab smaller animals. McGowan speculated that forms with {{protruding}} upper jaws, in the Eurhinosauria, would have used their pointy snouts to slash prey, as has been assumed for swordfish. For their food, many of the fish-shaped ichthyosaurs relied heavily on ancient cephalopods called Belemnoidea. They also most likely fed on fish. A few of the larger species had heavy jaws and teeth that indicated they fed on smaller reptiles. The large Triassic form Thalattoarchon had large <b>bladed</b> <b>teeth</b> and was probably a macropredator, capable of killing prey its own size, and Himalayasaurus and several species of Temnodontosaurus also shared adaptations for killing very large prey. These food preferences have been confirmed by coproliths which indeed contain the remains of fishes and cephalopods. Another confirmation is provided by fossilised stomach contents. Buckland in 1835 described the presence in a specimen of a large mass of partly digested fishes, recognisable by their scales. Subsequent research in 1968 determined that these belonged to the fish genus Pholidophorus but also that cephalopod beaks and sucker hooks were present. Such hard food particles apparently were retained by the stomach and regularly regurgitated. Stomach remains can also contain larger animals, including small ichthyosaurs. Carcasses of drowned animals were eaten as well: in 2003 a specimen of Platypterygius longmani was reported having besides fishes and a turtle the bones of a land bird in its stomach.|$|R
