5|$|From there, deeming Naruto and Sasuke {{a threat}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> current reincarnations of her grandsons and their {{resemblance}} {{to her own}} children, Kaguya takes Team 7 and Obito into her dimensional realms to kill them there. However, after being overpowered by Naruto and Sasuke, Kaguya is resealed with the tailed beasts being extracted from her body. Kaguya is voiced by Mami Koyama in Japanese and by Cissy Jones in the English dub.|$|E
5|$|These are of {{particular}} interest <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> first black holes discovered that were intermediate in mass between the conventional stellar-mass black hole and the supermassive black holes discovered at the cores of galaxies. The mass of these intermediate mass black holes {{is proportional to the}} mass of the clusters, following a pattern previously discovered between supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Ramcharitmanas, there is a section devoted to the veneration of the name of Rama. As per Tulsidas, repeating the name of Rama is the only means to attain God in the Kali age where the means suited for other ages like meditation, Karma, and Puja are ineffective. He says in Kavitavali that his own redemption is because of the power, glory and majesty of the name of Rama. In a couplet in the Gitavali, Tulsidas says that wishing for liberation without refuge in the name of Rama is like wishing to climb to the sky by holding on to the falling rain. In his view, the name of Rama is greater than both Nirguna and Saguna aspects of God – it controls both of them and is illuminates both like a bilingual interpreter. In a verse in the Dohavali, Tulsidas says that the Nirguna Brahman resides in his heart, the Saguna Brahman resides in his eyes and the name of Rama resides on his tongue, as if a radiant gemstone is kept between the lower and upper halves of a golden casket. He holds that Rama is superior to all other names of God, and argues that ra and ma being are the only two consonants that are written above all other consonants in the conjunct form in Sanskrit <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> two sounds in the word Rama.|$|E
50|$|The 2005 Horizon League Men's Basketball Tournament {{took place}} {{at the end of the}} 2004-05 regular season. The better seed hosted each first round match. Milwaukee hosted the second round and semifinals, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> top seed overall, as well as <b>the</b> final <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> highest {{remaining}} seed.|$|R

25|$|The 5pm curfew at {{the camp}} means no help {{available}} for refugees after 5pm. Don Bosco has special role in the camp <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> only workers who can help refugees in emergency situations at night.|$|E
25|$|Thus {{the row of}} {{terraces}} in Jeffrey Street {{have become}} historically important largely <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> survivors.

25|$|Therefore, {{the very}} impermanency {{of grass and}} tree, thicket and forest is the Buddha nature. The very impermanency of men and things, body and mind, is the Buddha nature. Nature and lands, {{mountains}} and rivers, are impermanent <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Buddha nature. Supreme and complete enlightenment, because it is impermanent, is the Buddha nature.|$|E
25|$|Plano East also {{maintains}} a rivalry with Allen High School {{to the north}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> two largest schools in the state, but the football aspect of this rivalry has weakened {{in recent years as}} Allen has continued to compete for multiple state championships, while Plano East has struggled to qualify for the postseason. However, this rivalry was reignited during the 2015-2016 school year, when Plano East had a nominally good season, though lost to Allen.|$|E
25|$|Neutrinos {{are also}} useful for probing astrophysical sources beyond the Solar System <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> only known {{particles}} {{that are not}} significantly attenuated by their travel through the interstellar medium. Optical photons can be obscured or diffused by dust, gas, and background radiation. High-energy cosmic rays, {{in the form of}} swift protons and atomic nuclei, are unable to travel more than about 100 megaparsecs due to the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit (GZK cutoff). Neutrinos, in contrast, can travel even greater distances barely attenuated.|$|E

25|$|China fully {{participates in}} the DEA's Operations TOPAZ and PURPLE, which are {{international}} monitoring initiatives that target acetic anhydride and potassium permanganate, respectively. Acetic anhydride is used to synthesize morphine base into heroin, and potassium permanganate is used as an oxidizer in cocaine production. Both chemicals are targeted <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> chemicals most often preferred, and most widely used, by illicit drug manufacturers. However, the effectiveness of Operation PURPLE has been declining recently, since participant nations are exporting significant amounts of potassium permanganate to non-participant countries.|$|E
25|$|Basophils are chiefly {{responsible}} for allergic and antigen response by releasing the chemical histamine causing the dilation of blood vessels. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> rarest {{of the white}} blood cells (less than 0.5% of the total count) and share physicochemical properties with other blood cells, they are difficult to study. They can be recognized by several coarse, dark violet granules, giving them a blue hue. The nucleus is bi- or tri-lobed, {{but it is hard}} to see because of the number of coarse granules that hide it.|$|E
25|$|Erik Erikson (1902–1994) is {{best known}} for his theory of {{psychological}} development, which has its roots in the psychoanalytic importance of identity in personality. His biographies of Gandhi and Martin Luther reveal Erikson's positive view of religion. He considered religions to be important influences in successful personality development <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> primary way that cultures promote the virtues associated with each stage of life. Religious rituals facilitate this development. Erikson's theory has not benefited from systematic empirical study, but it remains an influential and well-regarded theory in the psychological study of religion.|$|E
50|$|The shield {{representing}} <b>the</b> Piarist Fathers <b>was</b> {{decided to}} include it in along with <b>the</b> others, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> ones that finished the building between 1919 and 1926.|$|R

25|$|The volcanoes of the Victoria Land {{area are}} the most well known in Antarctica, most likely <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most accessible. Much of Victoria Land is mountainous, {{developing}} the eastern section of the Transantarctic Mountains, and the several scattered volcanoes include Mount Overlord and Mount Melbourne in the northern part. Farther south are two more well-known volcanoes, Mount Discovery and Mount Morning, which are on the coast across from Mount Erebus and Mount Terror on Ross Island. The volcanism {{in this area is}} caused by rifting along a number of rift zones increasing mainly north-south similar to the coast.|$|E
25|$|The {{plots of}} the {{television}} and radio series {{are more or less}} the same as that of the first two novels, though some of the events occur in a different order and many of the details are changed. Much of parts five and six of the radio series were written by John Lloyd, but his material did not make it into the other versions of the story and is not included here. Many consider the books' version of events to be definitive, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most readily accessible and widely distributed version of the story. However, they are not the final version that Adams produced.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the last}} hundred years, {{more than half of}} the Earth's {{wetlands}} have been destroyed and have disappeared. These wetlands are important not only <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> habitats of numerous inhabitants such as mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and invertebrates, but they support the growing of rice and other food crops as well as provide water filtration and protection from storms and flooding. Freshwater lakes such as the Aral Sea in central Asia have also suffered. Once the fourth largest freshwater lake, it has lost more than 58,000 square km of area and vastly increased in salt concentration over the span of three decades.|$|E

25|$|Besides the {{theoretical}} check on federal power, {{the distinction between}} the federal military reserves and the National Guard permits state governors to use their personnel to assist in disaster relief and to preserve law and order in times of crisis. The latter is permitted because the National Guard are not subject to the restrictions of the Posse Comitatus Act unless they are under federal jurisdiction. The restrictions, however, do apply to the four of the other five reserve components just as it does with their active duty military counterparts. The United States Coast Guard and Coast Guard Reserve are not subject to the restrictions of the Posse Comitatus Act <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> only Armed Force of the United States that {{is not part of the}} United States Department of Defense.|$|E
25|$|Most Lystrosaurus fossils {{have been}} found in the Balfour and Katberg Formations of the Karoo basin in South Africa; these {{specimens}} offer the best prospects of identifying species <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most numerous and have been studied for the longest time. As so often with fossils, there is debate in the paleontological community as to exactly how many species {{have been found}} in the Karoo. Studies from the 1930s to 1970s suggested a large number (23 in one case). However, by the 1980s and 1990s, only six species were recognized in the Karoo: L. curvatus, L. platyceps, L. oviceps, L. maccaigi, L. murrayi, and L. declivis. A study in 2011 reduced that number to four, treating the fossils previously labeled as L. platyceps and L. oviceps as members of L. curvatus.|$|E
25|$|Even though conversations occur between, and are {{influenced}} by, others, the roles Dasein takes up, the behaviors he comports, and the choices he makes are still his own. For example, self-as-student {{is just one}} role, or voice, that emerges toward the foreground within Dasein when he is learning in an environment such as school, while self-as-teacher is a diametrically opposed role, or voice, that emerges into the foreground when he is teaching (causing the self-as-student role, or voice, to recede into the background); but, Dasein still chooses to take up these roles or not, and if so, how to carry them out. These roles are termed voices <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> voices Dasein take up when dialoguing with others: e.g. a student dialogues with his teacher with the voice of being a student.|$|E
