50|$|Boiler {{water is}} the liquid phase of steam within a boiler. The term may also be applied to raw water {{intended}} for use in boilers, treated boiler feedwater, steam condensate being returned to a boiler, or <b>boiler</b> <b>blowdown</b> being removed from a boiler.|$|E
50|$|The multiple-valve {{superheater}} header {{was of the}} Melesco type. The boiler {{was fitted}} with four Ross-pop safety valves, each 2+1/2 in in diameter, and two Hopkinson <b>boiler</b> <b>blowdown</b> cocks on the firebox wrapper, one on each side. Feedwater was delivered to the boiler by two Friedmann vertical type non-lifting injectors, each with a capacity of 5200 imp gal per hour.|$|E
50|$|<b>Boiler</b> <b>blowdown</b> {{is water}} {{intentionally}} wasted from a boiler to avoid {{concentration of impurities}} during continuing evaporation of steam. The water is blown out of the boiler with some force by steam pressure within the boiler. Bottom blowdown used with early boilers caused abrupt downward adjustment of boiler water level and was customarily expelled downward to avoid the safety hazard of showering hot water on nearby individuals.|$|E
50|$|Initially {{she had a}} {{rectangular}} boiler, generating steam pressure at under 3 psi, and was fed by seawater. Boulton and Watt engines are not pressure engines, rather they are vacuum engines. (Salt water feed was common {{in the early days}} and could be done with low pressure and frequent <b>boiler</b> <b>blowdowns</b> to prevent salt scale build up on the plates.) The salt water played havoc with the boilers as the salinity rusted the wall thickness of the boiler, which would rot out. Beaver had to have a new boiler every seven years or so and went through multiple installations over her career. Over time the boiler pressure was increased, and 36 inch diameter cylinders replaced the original 42 inch cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{boiler water}} {{treatments}} cause precipitation of impurities as insoluble particles anticipating those particles will settle {{to the bottom}} of the boiler before they become entrained in water circulating past the heat exchange surfaces. These water treatments often include compounds forming a sludge to entrap such particles; and boilers intended for such water treatment include a structure called a mud drum at the lowest part of the <b>boiler.</b> Bottom <b>blowdown</b> involves periodically opening valves in the mud drum to allow boiler pressure to force accumulated sludge out of the <b>boiler.</b> Similar <b>blowdown</b> connections at the bottom of water wall headers are blown down less frequently. [...] Several short blowdown events remove sludge more effectively than a single continuous blowdown. Shorter blowdown events cause less significant changes in boiler water level, and are safer during periods of high steam demand.|$|R
5000|$|Automatic blowdown/continuous heat {{recovery}} system: This system allows the <b>boiler</b> to <b>blowdown</b> only when makeup water is flowing to the boiler, thereby transferring {{the maximum amount}} of heat possible from the blowdown to the makeup water. No flash tank is generally needed as the blowdown discharged is close to the temperature of the makeup water.|$|R
50|$|Dealkalizers {{are most}} often used as {{pre-treatment}} to a boiler and are usually preceded by a water softener. Alkalinity is a factor that most often dictates the amount of <b>boiler</b> <b>blowdown.</b> High alkalinity promotes boiler foaming and carryover and causes high amounts of boiler blowoff. When alkalinity is the limiting factor affecting the amount of blowdown, a dealkalizer will increase the cycles of concentrations and reduce blowdown and operating costs.|$|E
50|$|Log ponds are {{convenient}} water reservoirs for firefighting at sawmills; and {{for routine}} cooling and lubrication of saw blades and other mill machinery. Stormwater runoff from the mill yard and wastewater generated within the sawmill often {{flow into the}} log pond as the lowest point adjacent to the sawmill. <b>Boiler</b> <b>blowdown,</b> lumber drying kiln condensate, and exhaust steam from sawmill machinery sometimes kept a log pond from freezing during cold weather.|$|E
5000|$|Boiler water {{treatment}} {{is a type}} of industrial {{water treatment}} focused on removal or chemical modification of substances potentially damaging to the boiler. Varying types of treatment are used at different locations to avoid scale, corrosion, or foaming. [...] External treatment of raw water supplies intended for use within a boiler is focused on removal of impurities before they reach the boiler. Internal treatment within the boiler is focused on limiting the tendency of water to dissolve the boiler, and maintaining impurities in forms least likely to cause trouble before they can be removed from the boiler in <b>boiler</b> <b>blowdown.</b>|$|E
50|$|The metal {{blowdown}} tank, a cylindrical {{device with}} a vent pipe, {{is connected to}} the boiler, located about 7 metres west of the southernmost corner of the <b>boiler.</b> The <b>blowdown</b> tank was used to flush sediment out of the boiler under pressure, by allowing the steam to flash off up the vent pipe while the hot water drained away.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Surface {{blowdown}} {{is removed}} from the steam drum {{at the top of the}} <b>boiler</b> and Bottom <b>blowdown</b> {{is removed from}} the mud drum at the bottom of the boiler.|$|R
50|$|A {{steam boiler}} evaporates liquid water to form steam, or gaseous water; and {{requires}} frequent replenishment of boiler feedwater for the continuous production of steam required by most boiler applications. Water is a capable solvent, and will dissolve {{small amounts of}} solids from piping and containers including the boiler. Continuing evaporation of steam concentrates dissolved impurities until they reach levels potentially damaging to steam production within the <b>boiler.</b> Without <b>blowdown,</b> impurities would reach saturation levels and begin to precipitate within the boiler. Impurity concentrations are highest where steam is being produced near heat exchange surfaces. Precipitation {{would be expected to}} occur in the form of scale deposits on those heat exchange surfaces. Scale deposits thermally insulate heat exchange surfaces initially decreasing the rate of steam generation, and potentially causing boiler metals to reach failure temperatures.|$|R
50|$|The Hygroscopic Cycle is a {{thermodynamic}} cycle converting thermal energy into mechanical {{power by the}} means of a steam turbine.It {{is similar to the}} Rankine cycle using water as the motive fluid but with the novelty of introducing salts and their hygroscopic properties for the condensation. The salts are desorbed in the boiler or steam generator, where clean steam is released and superheated in order to be expanded and generate power through the steam turbine. <b>Boiler</b> <b>blowdown</b> with the concentrated hygroscocpic compounds is used thermally to pre-heat the steam turbine condensate, and as reflux in the steam-absorber.|$|E
5000|$|All boilers {{lose some}} water in steam leaks; and some is {{intentionally}} wasted as <b>boiler</b> <b>blowdown</b> to remove impurities accumulating within the boiler. [...] Steam locomotives and boilers generating steam {{for use in}} direct contact with contaminating materials may not recycle condensed steam. Replacement water is required to continue steam production. Make-up water is initially treated to remove floating and suspended materials. [...] Hard water intended for low-pressure boilers may be softened by substituting sodium for divalent cations of dissolved calcium and magnesium most likely to cause carbonate and sulfate scale. [...] High-pressure boilers typically require water demineralized by reverse osmosis, distillation or ion-exchange.|$|E
5000|$|Condensation {{is done in}} a steam absorber, {{as opposed}} to the {{traditional}} condenser found in the Rankine cycle. Here the outlet steam is absorbed by cooled hygroscopic compounds using the same principles as in absorption refrigarators. These hygroscopic compounds are cooled by an air-cooler, where the heat of condensation is dissipated by an air-cooler. Because of the thermal recovery of the <b>boiler</b> <b>blowdown,</b> the hygroscopic reaction in the steam condenser, and the use of an air-cooler to dissipate the heat of condensation, the efficiency of the cycle is higher, with a higher electrical output,reduces or eliminates the need for cooling water, [...] reduces the operating costs, and the capital cost of the utility power plant.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, {{the company}} began {{applying}} its <b>blowdown</b> <b>boiler</b> technology to improve the efficiency of water use at its oil sands operations. In 2013, Cenovus developed its SkyStrat™ drilling rig that allows an exploratory rig to be flown into remote areas by helicopter piece-by-piece, set up to drill a test well, dismantled and airlifted away. The process requires no roads, meaning little disturbance to the boreal forest. The company received an Environmental Performance award for the SkyStrat™ program.|$|R
50|$|Bottom {{blowdown}} piping drains {{the lowest}} {{parts of the}} boiler {{so it can be}} used to drain the boiler for servicing. Bottom blowdown piping must be of a diameter large enough to minimize the risk of being plugged with baked sludge. Modern <b>boilers</b> discharge bottom <b>blowdown</b> to a blowoff tank where the blowdown can flash and vent steam upwards without entraining water which might cause burns. A pipe near the bottom of the blowoff tank maintains a water level below the blowdown entry point and allows cooler water remaining from earlier blowdown events to drain from the tank first. Two bottom blowdown valves are often used in series to minimize erosion. One valve serves as the sealing valve, and the other as the blowdown valve. The sealing valve is customarily opened first and closed last. Both are opened rapidly and fully to minimize erosion on the seat and disk faces. Care is taken to avoid trapping scale or rust particles within the valve by reopening a valve to flush the particles through if resistance is encountered when attempting to close it. Bottom blowdown valves are often rebuilt or replaced whenever the boiler is taken out of service for maintenance.|$|R
5000|$|Impurities {{in water}} will leave solid {{deposits}} as steam evaporates. These solid deposits thermally insulate heat exchange surfaces initially decreasing {{the rate of}} steam generation, and potentially causing boiler metals to reach failure temperatures. [...] Boiler explosions were not uncommon until surviving boiler operators learned how to periodically clean their boilers. Some solids could be removed by cooling the boiler so differential thermal expansion caused brittle crystalline solids to crack and flake off metal boiler surfaces. Other solids were removed by acid washing or mechanical scouring. [...] Various rates of <b>boiler</b> <b>blowdown</b> could reduce the frequency of cleaning, but efficient operation and maintenance of individual boilers was determined {{by trial and error}} until chemists devised means of measuring and adjusting water quality to minimize cleaning requirements.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes, {{conductivity}} {{measurements are}} linked with other methods {{to increase the}} sensitivity of detection of specific types of ions. For example, in the boiler water technology, the <b>boiler</b> <b>blowdown</b> is continuously monitored for [...] "cation conductivity", which is the conductivity of the water {{after it has been}} passed through a cation exchange resin. This is a sensitive method of monitoring anion impurities in the boiler water in the presence of excess cations (those of the alkalizing agent usually used for water treatment). The sensitivity of this method relies on the high mobility of H+ in comparison with the mobility of other cations or anions. Beyond cation conductivity, there are analytical instruments designed to measure Degas conductivity, where conductivity is measured after dissolved carbon dioxide has been removed from the sample, either through reboiling or dynamic degassing.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} ten years energy costs have soared. The cost of coal and # 2 fuel oil have gone up by a factor of 3 - 5. Residual fuel oil cost has {{increased}} by approximately ten times. The cost of natural gas has gone up at an even higher rate. This paper reviews methods to conserve energy in industrial boiler water systems. Both mechanical and chemical approaches for energy conservation are discussed. The important aspects of efficient combustion are covered as well as other mechanical factors such as <b>boiler</b> <b>blowdown</b> heat recovery, economizers, air preheaters, and <b>boiler</b> <b>blowdown</b> control. The chemical aspects discussed for energy conservation include fuel additives, boiler internal treatment, and condensate treatments. The emphasis in this paper, for both mechanical and chemical approaches to energy conservation covers three areas: 1) maximizing the use of available Btu's in fuel through more efficient combustion, 2) improving the efficiency of heat transfer, and 3) recovering Btu's that have been previously considered uneconomical...|$|E
40|$|Malelane’s boiler {{blow-down}} flash, which was previously rejected to atmosphere, is now recovered into the turbo-alternator exhaust steam range {{and used for}} process heating duty. Various flash vapour recovery options have been evaluated for operability, maintainability and cost effectiveness. The design considerations for the blow-down vessel and the valve and piping configuration, which resulted from a Hazop Study, are explained. The recovery of 1. 6 tons per hour of <b>boiler</b> <b>blowdown</b> flash equates to R 260 000 per annum in coal savings...|$|E
40|$|Water {{treatment}} {{is an important}} aspect of boiler operation which can affect efficiency or result in damage if neglected. Without effective water treatment, scale can form on boiler tubes, reducing heat transfer, and causing a loss of boiler efficiency and availability. Proper control of <b>boiler</b> <b>blowdown</b> is also important to assure clean boiler surfaces without wasting water, heat, and chemicals. Recovering hot condensate for reuse as boiler feedwater is another means of improving system efficiency. Condensate which is contaminated with corrosion products or process chemicals, however, is ill fit for reuse; and steam which leaks from piping, valves, traps and connections cannot be recovered. Effective chemical treatment, in conjunction with mechanical system improvements, can assure that condensate can be safely returned and valuable energy recovered...|$|E

40|$|A steam energy {{tip sheet}} for the Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO). The {{prevention}} of scale formation in firetube boilers {{can result in}} substantial energy savings. Scale deposits occur when calcium, magnesium, and silica, commonly found in most water supplies, react to form a continuous layer of material on the waterside of the boiler heat exchange tubes. Scale creates a problem because it typically possesses a thermal conductivity, {{an order of magnitude}} less than the corresponding value for bare steel. Even thin layers of scale serve as an effective insulator and retard heat transfer. The result is overheating of boiler tube metal, tube failures, and loss of energy efficiency. Fuel consumption may increase by up to 5 % in firetube boilers because of scale. The boilers steam production may be reduced if the firing rate cannot be increased to compensate for the decrease in combustion efficiency. Energy losses as a function of scale thickness and composition are given. Any scale in a boiler is undesirable. The {{best way to deal with}} scale is not to let it form in the first place. Prevent scale formation by: (1) Pretreating of boiler makeup water (using water softeners, demineralizers, and reverse osmosis to remove scale-forming minerals); (2) Injecting chemicals into the boiler feedwater; and (3) Adopting proper <b>boiler</b> <b>blowdown</b> practices...|$|E
40|$|In {{small and}} medium sized {{manufacturing}} facilities, several situations exist where sources of waste heat and sinks needing heat transfer coexist. Examples of waste heat include {{but are not}} limited to: drained hot water streams from water cooled manufacturing equipments, waste heat from compressors, lighting systems, chiller condensers, <b>boiler</b> <b>blowdown,</b> building exhaust, and flue gas. Examples of heat sinks needing heat transfer include but not limited to drying, space heat, domestic hotwater, air, and oil preheaters. The heating requirements for these heat sinks are generally met by burning fossil fuels or even by using electric heaters while available waste heat is rejected to the surrounding environment using devices such as cooling towers or chillers which require additional electrical energy for their operation. The practice of rejecting waste heat to the environment and meeting heating requirements by burning fossil fuels or by using electric heaters results in: a) energy waste; b) global warming due to fossil fuels burning and c) economic inefficiency. The objective of the work reported in this report was to develop a design of a heat rejection system, which will replace the operation of currently used mechanical vapor compression chillers at the GBC Film Products in Addison (Illinois). The designed system utilizes the rejected heat for space heating during the winter season and results in additional savings by replacing the combustion of fossil fuels. The design was unique because the proposed system results in dual savings by: utilizing a low temperature heat source for space heating and by reducing the operating cost of the chillers...|$|E
40|$|Traditional polysaccharides {{extraction}} {{processes are}} often performed under heating {{which makes them}} time-, energy- and solvent-consuming. The aim of this work {{was to assess the}} possibility of using ohmic heating to replace conventional heating in the extraction of seaweed hydrocolloids. This technology is able to heat almost instantaneously the whole volume to be treated, using the ability that most materials have to dissipate energy as heat. As a result, it is energetically much more efficient, with efficiencies well above 95 %. In traditional boilers, energetic efficiency is usually around 70 - 80 %. This implies that the energetic efficiency of traditional extraction is below these values, as we have also to account for energy losses in the pipelines and in the extractor. The extraction of agar from Gelidium corneum (sesquipedale) was chosen as a model process due to the high temperatures and energy input needed. All traditional and ohmic extractions were made with a ratio of 50 g of water: 1 g of seaweed at 95 °C, for 2 hours on seaweeds pre-treated with NaOH and neutralized with diluted acetic acid. For the ohmic system, the voltage was set at 600 V and the distance between electrodes was 10 cm. The yields achieved (around 15 - 20 %) were similar in both traditional and ohmic extractions. Gelling ability, sulphate and 3 - 6 -anydrogalactose contents were also in the same range resulting in agars with similar functional properties. Ohmic heating is thus an energetically more efficient alternative to the conventional process of extraction of agar from seaweeds without impairing its functional properties. Besides the evident energy efficiency advantage, steam (and thus <b>boiler</b> <b>blowdown)</b> savings also constitute an important environmental improvement...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{function}} of a boiler is to transfer heat from hot gases generated by the combustion of fuel into water until it becomes hot or turns to steam. The steam or hot water can then be used in building or facility processes. Except for {{a small number of}} specialty models, boilers generally fit into one of the two common categories: fire-tube boilers and water-tube boilers. Fire-tube boilers pass hot combustion gases through tubes submerged in water. Water-tube boilers, on the other hand, circulate water inside the tubes in a closed vessel filled with hot combustions gases. In either category the boiler feedwater and fuel often contain impurities, which impairs boiler operation and efficiency. Chemical additives can be used to correct the problems caused by these impurities. To improve feedwater quality, fuel oil condition, and steam purity, these chemicals can be injected directly into the feedwater, steam or fuel oil. This fact sheet discusses the potential problems associated with the impurities in the feedwater and fuel and the chemical treatment programs available. Benefits of Chemical Treatments • Increase boiler efficiency; • Reduce fuel, operating and maintenance costs; • Minimize maintenance and downtime; and • Protect equipment from corrosion and extend equipment lifetime. Chemical Treatments for Waterside of Boiler Tubes The feedwater is composed of makeup water (usually city water from outside boiler room / process) and condensate (condensed steam returning to the boiler). The feedwater normally contains impurities, which can cause deposits and other related problems inside the boiler. Common impurities in water include alkalinity, silica, iron, dissolved oxygen and calcium and magnesium (hardness). Blowdown, a periodic or continuous water removal process, is used to limit the concentration of impurities in boiler water and to control the buildup of dissolved solid levels in the <b>boiler.</b> <b>Blowdown</b> is essential in addition to chemical treatments...|$|E
