50|$|Shure's Beta {{series of}} {{microphones}} {{was introduced in}} 1989. Originally the Beta 58 was available as the Beta 58C (chrome grill) or the Beta 58M (matte grill). The Beta 58C was eventually discontinued and the Beta 58M became just the Beta 58. The Beta 58 was then discontinued and replaced by the Beta 58A. In 1996, Shure altered the Beta 58 to create the Beta 58A. The Beta 58A has a completely new cartridge in it. While the new cartridge is meant to mimic the old cartridge as far as polar pattern, output level, and frequency response goes, {{it is a different}} cartridge and will sound slightly different. Two major differences are that Shure removed the hum <b>bucking</b> <b>coil</b> on the new model and added an output transformer.|$|E

Electromagnetic modelling of typical very-low-frequency detector heads shows the effect of coil placement errors on detector sensitivity. Provided the <b>bucking</b> <b>coil</b> ‘tracks’ the receive coil, required error corrections can remain small. A correctly-aligned head could detect a gold ring target at a range of about 12 cm.

A plan for the solenoid test requires separate excitation of the main coil and the bucking coils and then connecting the coils in series.

The main coil produces a central field of up to 7 T and the effective length is more than 140 mm, the two <b>bucking</b> <b>coils</b> can shield most of the fringe field, and the four racetrack superconducting coils produce the steering magnetic field. Its leakage field in the cavity zone is about 5 x 10 (- 5) T when the shielding material Niobium and cryogenic permalloy are used as the Meissner shielding and passive shielding respectively.

The solenoid is comprised of the main <b>coil,</b> two <b>bucking</b> <b>coils,</b> two dipole corrector windings, and a low carbon steel flux return. At the excitation current of 250 A, the magnetic field reaches 7. 2 T {{in the center of}} the solenoid and is less than 5 G on the axis at a distance of 150 mm from the center.

Improved field shape measurements have been obtained by constructing coil geometries which reduce the flux contribution from unwanted field derivatives. A <b>bucking</b> <b>coil</b> scheme employing reference coils in both the test magnet and a reference magnet reduce the sensitivity to power supply fluctuations. Design strategies for various measurement requirements are described, along with the details of implementing an assembly to measure curved 6 m and 4 m dipoles.

40|$|The air-core coil sensor (ACS) {{is widely}} used as a {{transducer}} to measure the variation in magnetic fields of a helicopter transient electromagnetic (TEM) system. A high periodic emitting current induces the magnetic field signal of the underground medium. However, such current also generates a high primary field signal that can affect the received signal of the ACS and even damage the receiver. To increase the dynamic range of the received signal {{and to protect the}} receiver when emitting current rises/falls, the combination of ACS with magnetic flux compensation structure (<b>bucking</b> <b>coil)</b> is necessary. Moreover, the optimized ACS, which is composed of an air-core coil and a differential pre-amplifier circuit, must be investigated to meet the requirements of the helicopter TEM system suited to rapid surveying for shallow buried metal mine in rough topography. Accordingly, two ACSs are fabricated in this study, and their performance is verified and compared inside a magnetic shielding room. Using the designed ACSs, field experiments are conducted in Baoqing County. The field experimental data show that the primary field response can be compensated when the <b>bucking</b> <b>coil</b> is placed at an appropriate point in the range of allowed shift distance beyond the center of the transmitting coil and that the damage to the receiver induced by the over-statured signal can be solved. In conclusion, a more suitable ACS is adopted and is shown to have better performance, with a mass of 2. 5 kg, resultant effective area of 11. 6 m 2 (i. e., diameter of 0. 496 m), 3 dB bandwidth of 66 kHz, signal-to-noise ratio of 4 (i. e., varying magnetic field strength of 0. 2 nT/s), and normalized equivalent input noise of 3. 62 nV/m 2...|$|E
40|$|An {{ionization}} {{cooling channel}} is a tightly spaced lattice containing absorbers {{for reducing the}} momentum of the muon beam, rf cavities for restoring the momentum and strong solenoids for focusing the beam. Such a lattice is an essential feature of most designs for Neutrino Factories and Muon Colliders. Here, we explore three different approaches for designing ionization cooling channels with periodic solenoidal focusing. Key parameters such as the engineering constraints that are arising from the length and separation between the solenoidal coils are systematically examined. In addition, we propose novel approaches for reducing the peak magnetic field inside the rf cavities by using either a magnetic shield system or a <b>bucked</b> <b>coils</b> configuration. Our lattice designs are numerically examined against two independent codes: The ICOOL and G 4 BL code. The feasibility of our proposed cooling channels to muon accelerators is examined by applying the proposed lattices to the frontend of a Neutrino Factory...|$|R
40|$|The medium beta {{section of}} the ISAC-II heavy ion {{accelerator}} consists of five cryomodules each containing four quarter wave bulk niobium resonators and one superconducting solenoid. The 9 T solenoid is not shielded but is equipped with <b>bucking</b> <b>coils</b> to reduce the magnetic field in the neighbouring rf cavities. A prototype cryomodule has been designed and assembled at TRIUMF. The cryomodule vacuum space shares the cavity vacuum and contains a mu-metal shield, an LN 2 cooled, copper, thermal shield, plus the cold mass and support system. Several cold tests have been done to characterize the cryomodule. Early operating experience with a high field solenoid inside a cryomodule containing SRF cavities will be given. The results include measurements of the passive magnetic field in the cryomodule. We also estimate changes in the magnetic field during the test due to trapped flux in the solenoid. Residual field reduction due to hysteresis cycling of the solenoid has been demonstrated. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Superconducting {{solenoids}} {{are increasingly}} used as focusing lenses in transport channels of proton linear RF accelerators. If these accelerators employ superconducting RF cavities, each focusing lens is usually comprised of three coils connected in series: a main coil, which provides the needed focusing strength, and two <b>bucking</b> <b>coils,</b> {{that help to}} reduce magnetic field outside the lens. When a normal zone develops {{in any of the}} coils in a focusing lens, it propagates with a direction and a rate which depends on the coil and the specific part of the coil in which the quench first occurred. As a result of this propagation process (quenching), the temperature and/or voltage of parts of the lens can exceed safe limits, thus compromising lens reliability. On the other hand, the negative impact of quench events can be significantly mitigated if an external resistor is used to absorb a part of the energy stored in the magnetic field. This paper presents the main results of a solenoid quench protection study based on computational modeling of normal zone propagation in solenoid lenses being built for a superconducting linear RF accelerator under development at Fermilab...|$|R
40|$|CW normal {{conducting}} guns {{usually do}} not achieve very high field gradient and waste much RF power at high field gradient compared to superconducting cavities. But they have less trapped modes and wakefields compared to the superconducting cavities due to their low Q. The external <b>bucking</b> <b>coil</b> can also be applied {{very close to the}} cathode to improve the beam quality. By using a low frequency gun with a recessed cathode and a carefully designed beam line we can get a high average current and a high quality beam with acceptable RF power loss on the cavity wall. This paper shows that the CW normal conducting gun can be a backup solution for those projects which need high peak and average current, low emittance electron beams such as the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) e-cooling project and Energy Recovery Linac (Em) project...|$|E
40|$|ASTROMAG, a {{particle}} astrophysics experimental facility proposed for running alongside a Space Station, {{has a large}} superconducting magnet to analyze particles coming from deep space. Several types of magnets were investigated {{for use in the}} ASTROMAG central facility. The factors which influence the selection of the magnet coil design include: (1) the upper limit of particle momentum resolved (proportional to the integrated field) as a function of solid angle; (2) cryogenic design and its effect on cryogen lifetime for a given central facility mass; and (3) the overall cost of the magnet coils and cryostat. Four magnet types are analyzed in this paper. These include a simple two-coil solenoid (the baseline design),two disk coils at the ends of the helium tank, a two-coil toroid and a thin solenoid plus <b>bucking</b> <b>coil.</b> A balance must be struck between cryostat lifetime, total mass and the integrated field through the detectors.

40|$|The {{design of}} a photoinjector, in {{particular}} that of the electron source, is of central importance for free electron laser (FEL) machines where a high beam brightness is required. In comparison to standard designs, an rf traveling-wave photocathode gun can provide a more rigid beam with a higher brightness and a shorter pulse. This is illustrated by applying a specific optimization procedure to the SwissFEL photoinjector, for which a brightness improvement up to a factor 3 could be achieved together with a double gun output energy compared to the reference setup foreseeing a state-of-the-art S-band rf standing-wave gun. The higher brightness is mainly given by a (at least) double peak current at the exit of the gun which brings benefits for both the beam dynamics in the linac and {{the efficiency of the}} FEL process. The gun design foresees an innovative coaxial rf coupling {{at both ends of the}} structure which allows a solenoid with integrated <b>bucking</b> <b>coil</b> to be placed around the cathode in order to provide the necessary focusing right after emission...|$|E
40|$|The Dual-Axis Radiography for Hydrodynamic Testing (DARHT) {{facility}} at Los Alamos {{was developed for}} flash radiography of large hydrodynamic experiments. Both axes now routinely produce radiographic source spot sizes having full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) less than 1 mm. The beam canonical angular momentum contributes to spot size, and it is minimized by using a shielded source of electrons. An ideal shielded source creates the beam {{in a region where}} the axial magnetic field is zero, thus the canonical momentum is also zero, since the beam is born with no mechanical angular momentum. It then follows from Busch's theorem that the canonical angular momentum is minimized at the target, at least in principal. In the DARHT accelerators, the axial magnetic field at the cathode is minimized by using a solenoid with reverse polarity to cancel out whatever solenoidal beam transport field exists there. This is imperfect in practice, because of radial variation of the total field across the cathode surface, solenoid misalignments, and long-term variability of solenoid fields for given currents. This article quantifies the relative importance of canonical momentum in determining the focal spot, and establishes a systematic methodology for tuning the <b>bucking</b> <b>coils</b> for minimum spot size...|$|R
40|$|The beam {{dynamics}} of superconducting (SC) heavy-ion linacs {{operating in the}} velocity range below 0. 4 c require a compact accelerating-focusing lattice. The use of SC solenoids together with SC RF resonators within a common cryostat can solve the real-estate problem. The solenoids must have low fringe fields to avoid magnetic flux capture in the SC RF resonators. Also, incorporating dipole steering coils together with the SC solenoids in one magnet assembly can increase the compactness of the linac lattice. R&D work {{has been carried out}} to determine the feasibility of combining the three elements of high solenoid field, low fringe field, and integral dipole field, into one compact package. A 9 -Tesla magnet has been initially designed and will be prototyped, with the goal of eventually developing 14 -Tesla solenoids of similar design. The most important design issues are: (1) to minimize stray field in the RF cavity region using SC <b>bucking</b> <b>coils</b> and (2) to achieve adequate mechanical stability of the transverse dipole windings in the presence of forces produced by the solenoid/bucking coil assembly. The assembly, including terminals, switches, and protection circuit, are designed to fit inside a 25 -cm diameter helium reservoir. The results of the preliminary design of the solenoid, including numerical simulations of the beam dynamics, are reported...|$|R
40|$|The future {{accelerator}} {{complex of}} the Neutrino Factory {{will have an}} excellent precision and outstanding discovery reach, and is therefore a facility of choice for precise neutrino oscillation measurements. In the Neutrino Factory, muons are accumulated into storage rings and decay to neutrinos. However, {{due to the fact}} that the muon beam is produced occupying a large transverse phase-space, it is essential that its emittance is decreased using ionisation cooling. The reference ionisation cooling lattice of the Neutrino Factory has a large magnetic field at the position of the RF cavities, and there is a strong concern this can lead to RF breakdown. Therefore, there lies a great necessity for alternative cooling lattices to be found. This thesis presents several cooling lattices that were designed aiming to mitigate the problem of the RF breakdown in the presence of a magnetic field, that the reference lattice suffers from. In particular, amongst these lattices, a promising new configuration which makes use of a pair of opposite polarity and homocentric coils, named “Bucked Coils”, is presented. The <b>Bucked</b> <b>Coils</b> lattice not only manages to successfully achieve a virtually zero longitudinal magnetic field at the position of the RF cavities, but also obtains a better transmission than the reference lattice. A detailed comparison between the reference and the new lattices is presented with respect to the magnetic field, transmission and cooling efficiency. A possible extension of the work is also discussed. A six-dimensional cooling could be used at a Neutrino Factory but is essential for a Muon Collider. Another novel configuration, which aims to achieve 6 D ionisation cooling, is presented in this thesis. This new lattice creates dispersion with the use of dipoles, and a correlation between energy loss and position with the use of wedge absorbers. A detailed description of this lattice configuration and analysis is given, together with preliminary results. Imperial Users onl...|$|R
40|$|The {{porosity}} of sea ice is {{a fundamental}} physical parameter that governs the mechanical strength of sea ice and the mobility of gases and nutrients for biological processes and biogeochemical cycles in the sea ice layer. However, {{little is known about}} the spatial distribution of the sea ice porosity and its variability between different sea ice types; an efficient and nondestructive method to measure this property is currently missing. Sea ice porosity is linked to the bulk electrical conductivity of sea ice, a parameter routinely used to discriminate between sea ice and seawater by electromagnetic (EM) induction sensors. Here, we have evaluated the prospect of porosity retrieval of sea ice by means of bulk conductivity estimates using 1 D multifrequency EM inversion schemes. We have focused on two inversion algorithms, a smoothness-constrained inversion and a Marquardt-Levenberg inversion, which we modified for the nonlinear signal bias caused by a passive <b>bucking</b> <b>coil</b> operated in such a highly conductive environment. Using synthetic modeling studies, 1 D inversion algorithms and multiple frequencies, we found that we can resolve the sea ice conductivity within +- 0. 01 S∕m.

40|$|A {{baseline}} {{approach to}} a design of a focusing solenoid for the superconducting section of the HINS linac was described in [1], where a set of requirements for the system can also be found. After this approach was accepted for implementation, several design iterations were made. Modifications were made to reflect better knowledge of coil winding density and superconducting strand parameters, to introduce dipole correctors {{in some of the}} solenoids and a gap in the flux return, and to make the solenoid shorter. The modifications resulted in some re-optimization of the solenoid’s geometry. It was shown in [2] {{that as a result of}} thermal contraction during cooling down, gaps can develop between bucking coils and a flux return. To fix the problem, a gap in the flux return was introduced in order to keep the coil assembly under compression during cool down and excitation by using additional compression elements (stainless steel screws). The presence of this gap resulted in significantly higher stray field level and required additional shielding. Changing situation with availability of superconducting strand also resulted in some design modifications.

The acoustic emission measurement effort was developed as a health monitoring metric for several Stirling convertors undergoing life testing. While accelerometers have been used in the past to monitor dynamic signature, the acoustic sensors were chosen to monitor cycle events, such gas bearing operation. Several electromagnetic interference (EMI) experiments were performed on a pair of Advanced Stirling Convertors (ASC). These tests demonstrated that a simple <b>bucking</b> <b>coil</b> was capable of reducing the alternating current (ac) magnetic field below the ASRG system specification. The thermoacoustic Stirling concept eliminates the displacer typically found in Stirling machines by making use of the pressure oscillations of a traveling acoustic wave.
