30|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that snags of some species, such as white fir, may persist longer than other species due to a {{tendency}} to break above the downed height threshold and gradually lose height over time (Raphael and White 1984, Everett et al. 1999, Landram et al. 2002, Chambers and Mast 2005; Table 1). This pattern is inconsistent with our results, with average initial break heights below 3.5  m and the majority of snags breaking at groundline. However, Kimmey (1955) also reported that it was common for ponderosa pine and white fir fire-killed snags to break at ground level. We used 3.65  m as the height criterion for a snag to move from standing to downed; therefore, most snags converted to downed upon the initial <b>break</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were not able to detect further trends in snag height loss over time. While most other studies of fire-killed snags use shorter height criteria of between 1.5 – 1.8  m (Table 1), our findings of species differences and the importance of DBH in determining persistence are still in agreement with these studies.|$|E
40|$|We report our {{discovery}} and early time optical, near-infrared, and radio wavelength follow-up {{observations of the}} afterglow of the gamma-ray burst GRB 021211. Our optical observations, beginning 21 min after the burst trigger, demonstrate that the early afterglow of this burst is roughly three magnitudes fainter than the afterglow of GRB 990123 at similar epochs, and fainter than almost all known afterglows at an epoch of 1 d after the GRB. Our near-infrared and optical observations indicate {{that this is not}} due to extinction. Combining our observations with data reported by other groups, we identify the signature of a reverse shock. This reverse shock is not detected to a 3 -sigma limit of 110 uJy in an 8. 46 -GHz VLA observation at t= 0. 10 d, implying either that the Lorentz factor of the burst gamma ~ 1 week, we find that the late-time radio flux is suppressed by a factor of two relative to the >~ 80 uJy peak flux at optical wavelengths.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} new results {{showing that}} the Sofala shelf in the Mozambique Channel (20 °S, 36 °E) is a previously unknown “hot spot” for the generation of internal tides and internal waves. We investigate available Envisat advanced synthetic aperture radar imagery of the region, which is capable of showing the surface signatures of the internal waves. This is complemented by modeling of the ray pathways of internal tidal energy propagation, and of the P. G. Baines (1982) barotropic body force, which drives the generation of internal tides near the shelf break. The hot spot region is localized between 20 ° and 21 °S because of the particular nature of the bathymetry there. Farther north and south, the forcing is reduced and insufficient to generate internal solitary waves in the synthetic aperture radar images. The analysis reveals two distinct types of internal wave trains that are observed traveling oceanward away from the shelf <b>break,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> suggest that these result from direct generation at the shelf break and from “local” generation at about 80 km from the shelf break, respectively, because of the surfacing of internal tidal rays at the thermocline. Finally, we have investigated seasonal differences in the wave patterns, which penetrate more extensively into the channel during the southern summer and appear slightly farther to the south during the southern winter. We also conclude that the local generation process {{is more likely to}} occur during the winter when the stratification is reduced. <br/...|$|E

40|$|The organ {{has been}} called "the monster which never breathes, " but perhaps its breaths are simply very long and deep. In Charlemagne Palestine's perambulations through the organ's sonic landscape, this is {{certainly}} the case—the breath is some 70 minutes long. Schlingen-Blängen was first realized in Holland in 1979, although it had several precursors. Composer-performer Palestine had become well known in avant-garde circles in New York and Europe and was often seen and heard at major festivals. Usually, the instrument of his long, environmental, quasi-sacred musical inventions was the Imperiale Grand Bösendorfer piano. The alchemical magic of dancing harmonics which he managed to coax out of this magnificent instrument through sheer physical will (indeed the physicality of a Palestine performance was memorable—a battle of wills with the piano itself) transformed both physical space and imaginary space inside the listeners' heads. Those who have experienced a Charlemagne Palestine Bösendorfer performance such as Strumming Music, or Lower Depths or Timbral Assault (see discography) usually have found the relentless coaxing of sound from the piano to be a physical ballet {{as well as a}} spiritual-musico exercise. So the idea of creating a new sound world through the resources of an old tracker Baroque organ seemed quite a different tack to take. The physicality of the performance would be less present, more implied in the overwhelming acoustics of the space than in the movements of the keyboard performer. In Schlingen-Blängen the arms and torso of Palestine take a <b>break</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> experience sounds set into motion by the initial choosing of a chord and its timbres (the setting of the registers or stops); the melodic changes that occur are subtle and few. The resultant torrent of sound, which begins as a trickle, might delude the listener into a visual hallucination of the ever-active composer somehow hammering away at keys and pedals, but such is not the case. This very unpalpable acoustic experience seems unusual for this composer. Yet Palestine had worked with disembodied organ sonority before, in fact well before h...|$|E
40|$|The {{internal}} libraries of Linux are evolving rapidly, {{to address}} new requirements and improve performance. These evolutions, however, entail a massive problem of collateral evolution in Linux device drivers: for every change that affects an API, all dependent drivers must be updated accordingly. Manually performing such collateral evolutions is time-consuming and unreliable, and has lead to errors when modifications {{have not been}} done consistently. In this paper, we present an automatic program transformation tool, Coccinelle, for documenting and automating device driver collateral evolutions. Because Linux programmers are accustomed to manipulating program modifications in terms of patch files, this tool uses a language based on the patch syntax to express transformations, extending patches to semantic patches. Coccinelle preserves the coding style of the original driver, as would a human programmer. We have evaluated our approach on 62 representative collateral evolutions that were previously performed manually in Linux 2. 5 and 2. 6. On a test suite of over 5800 relevant driver files, the semantic patches for these collateral evolutions update over 93 % of the files completely. In the remaining cases, the user is typically alerted to a partial match against the driver code, identifying the files that must be considered manually. We have additionally identified over 150 driver files where the maintainer made an error in performing the collateral evolution, but Coccinelle transforms the code correctly. Finally, several patches derived {{from the use of}} Coccinelle have been accepted into the Linux kernel. “The Linux USB code has been rewritten at least three times. We’ve done this over time in order to handle things that we didn’t originally need to handle, like high speed devices, and just because we learned the problems of our first design, and to fix bugs and security issues.
