50|$|Alternately, a {{new breed}} of cooling system is being developed, <b>inserting</b> a <b>pump</b> into the thermo siphon loop. This adds another degree of {{flexibility}} for the design engineer, as the heat can now be effectively transported away from the heat source and either reclaimed or dissipated to ambient.

This allows for smaller condensers, smaller fans, and/or the effective dissipation of heat in a high ambient temperature environment. These systems are, in essence, the next generation fluid cooling paradigm, as they are approximately 10 times more efficient than single phase water. Since the system uses a dielectric as the heat transport medium, leaks do not cause a catastrophic failure of the electric system.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground: Dihydroorotate {{dehydrogenase}} (DHOD) is a {{flavin mononucleotide}} containing enzyme, which catalyzes the oxidation of (S) -dihydroorotate to orotate, the fourth {{step in the}} de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. Lactococcus lactis contains two genes encoding different functional DHODs whose sequences are only 30 % identical. One of these enzymes, DHODA, is a highly efficient dimer, while the other, DHODB, shows optimal activity only {{in the presence of}} an iron-sulphur cluster containing protein with which it forms a complex tetramer. Sequence alignments have identified three different families among the DHODs: the two L. lactis enzymes belong to two of the families, whereas the enzyme from E. coli is a representative of the third. As no three-dimensional structures of DHODs are currently available, we set out to determine the crystal structure of DHODA from L. lactis. The differences between the two L. lactis enzymes make them particularly interesting for studying flavoprotein redox reactions and for identifying the differences between the enzyme families. Results: The crystal structure of DHODA has been determined to 2. 0 Å resolution. The enzyme is a dimer of two crystallographically independent molecules related by a non-crystallographic twofold axis. The protein folds into and α/β barrel with the flavin molecule sitting between the top of the barrel and a subdomain formed by several <b>barrel</b> <b>inserts.</b> Above the flavin isoalloxazine ring there is a small water filled cavity, completely buried beneath the protein surface and surrounded by many conserved residues. This cavity is proposed as the substrate-binding site. Conclusions: The crystal structure has allowed the function of many of the conserved residues in DHODs to be identified: many of these are associated with binding the flavin group. Important differences were identified in some of the active-site residues which vary across the distinct DHOD families, implying significant mechanistic differences. The substrate cavity, although buried, is located beneath a highly conserved loop which is much less ordered {{than the rest of the}} protein and may be important in giving access to the cavity. The location of the conserved residues surrounding this cavity suggests the potential orientation of the substrate...|$|R
5000|$|Regardless of {{the type}} of gun employed, tournament skeet {{shooters}} have a problem. American skeet tournaments consist of at least four events: the 12 ga., the 20 ga., the 28 ga. and the [...]410 bore. These are four different sized shotgun shells (diminishing in size, in the order listed), requiring four different sets of chambers. Historically, that required four different guns, each weighing, balancing and presenting, differently, undermining a shooter's consistency. There is relatively little manufacturer interest in a cure for the problem with pumps and automatics. However, double guns present opportunities. One solution is to build four matched weight sets of barrels to fit one action (a [...] "four barrel set"). This is expensive, but in the 1970s to early 1990s, four barrel sets reigned supreme in American skeet, and they remain thoroughly competitive. Beyond the expense, the principal criticism is that the four barrel set can still present a different sight picture for each gauge, because each barrel set, in diminishing gauge, is narrower than the prior set. [...] The answer was to build <b>barrel</b> <b>inserts</b> for 12 ga. two barrel guns: these allow the shooter to switch out matching sets of full length light weight aluminum tubes (10-12 oz. per set) chambered for 20, 28 and [...]410, in almost any 12 ga. double gun. One could then use one gun to shoot the 20, 28 and [...]410 events with the same weight, balance and sight picture for each of these gauges. However, with tubes removed to shoot 12 ga. rounds, the gun will be 10-12 oz. lighter, and thus will swing faster and kick harder, undermining some of the consistency intrinsic to the concept. The solutions are: to stop shooting 12 ga. rounds at all in tournaments, thus always shooting through the inserts; buying a second, pre-weighted 12 ga. barrel (the latter makes the combination a [...] "two barrel tube set"); or, three, adding removable weights to the 12 ga. barrels when shooting without the sub-gauge tubes, to try to match the weight and balance of the gun when tubed. All three solutions are employed, depending upon shooter preferences and/or resources, and tubed over and under shoguns now dominate American skeet tournaments.|$|R

50|$|As {{the bullet}} enters the <b>barrel,</b> it <b>inserts</b> {{itself into the}} rifling, a process that {{gradually}} wears down the barrel, and also causes the barrel to heat up more rapidly. Therefore, some machine-guns are equipped with quick-change barrels that can be swapped every few thousand rounds, or in earlier designs, were water-cooled. Unlike older carbon steel barrels, which were limited to around 1,000 shots before the extreme heat caused accuracy to fade, modern stainless steel barrels for target rifles are much more resistant to wear, allowing many thousands of rounds to be fired before accuracy drops. (Many shotguns and small arms have chrome-lined barrels to reduce wear and enhance corrosion resistance. This is rare on rifles designed for extreme accuracy, as the plating process is difficult and liable to reduce {{the effect of the}} rifling.) Modern ammunition has a hardened lead core with a softer outer cladding or jacket, typically of an alloy of copper and nickel - cupro-nickel. Some ammunition is even coated with molybdenum disulfide to further reduce internal friction - the so-called 'moly-coated' bullet.|$|R
50|$|The MG 34s were fitted into {{specially}} designed hinged mounts {{for ease of}} use. The gunner could quickly withdraw his MG34 from one loophole and push it along a rail to another.

Each MG 34 fired a 7.92mm round at a fire rate in excess of 1000 rounds per minute to a range of approximately 1500 yards. The design of the machine gun mounts permitted the gun crew easily to change the gun's barrel; the gunner would stop firing, lift the hinged scope out of position, open up the gun, slide out the <b>barrel</b> and <b>insert</b> a new one. For a well trained crew this would only take seconds. The mounting also incorporated a chute which emptied spent casings into bags below.|$|R
5000|$|Shooting {{the softest}} {{possible}} shot {{will result in}} more shot deformation and a wider pattern.

When the shot exits the <b>barrel,</b> the <b>insert</b> helps to push the shot out from the center, opening up the pattern. Often these result in inconsistent performance, though modern designs are doing much better than the traditional improvised solutions.

Spreader wads and non-spherical shot are disallowed in some competitions.
