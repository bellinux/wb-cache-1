500|$|The {{origin of}} this claim has been {{difficult}} to pin down with any certainty. John H. McMasters recounted an anecdote about an unnamed Swiss aerodynamicist at a dinner party who performed some rough calculations and concluded, presumably in jest, that according to the equations, bumblebees cannot fly. In later years, McMasters has backed away from this origin, suggesting there could be multiple sources, and the earliest he has found was a reference in the 1934 book [...] by French entomologist Antoine Magnan (1881–1938); they had applied the equations of air resistance to insects and found [...] their flight was impossible, but [...] "One shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> the results of the calculations don't square with reality".|$|E
500|$|The Australian Financial Review (AFR) had {{for years}} carried stories {{critical}} of managed investment schemes. An AFR story had prompted the letter, supporting the forest industries, from federal government minister Wilson Tuckey in 2000. When Great Southern collapsed, Tuckey was asked for comment by the Sydney Morning Herald. He said [...] "Everyone thought [...] {{was a good idea}} at the time". He argued investors would probably not lose their money, but [...] "shareholders and lenders could be in a bit of trouble". With both Great Southern Group and Timbercorp under administration, the AFR continued its editorial attack on government MIS policy. An AFR journalist wrote, [...] "as a general rule, MIS industries are inherently doomed to fail both from an investment and a social good perspective... Taxpayers should... not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> they continue to fall over".|$|E
500|$|In Antoine Magnan's 1934 book Le vol des insectes, {{he wrote}} that he and André Sainte-Laguë had applied the {{equations}} of air resistance to insects and found that their flight could not be explained by fixed-wing calculations, but that [...] "One shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> {{the results of the}} calculations don't square with reality". This has led to a common misconception that bees [...] "violate aerodynamic theory", but in fact it merely confirms that bees do not engage in fixed-wing flight, and that their flight is explained by other mechanics, such as those used by helicopters. In 1996 it was shown that vortices created by many insects' wings helped to provide lift. High-speed cinematography and robotic mock-up of a bee wing showed that lift was generated by [...] "the unconventional combination of short, choppy wing strokes, a rapid rotation of the wing as it flops over and reverses direction, and a very fast wing-beat frequency". Wing-beat frequency normally increases as size decreases, but as the bee's wing beat covers such a small arc, it flaps approximately 230 times per second, faster than a fruitfly (200 times per second) which is 80 times smaller.|$|E

2500|$|Scientists {{interviewed about}} the {{announcement}} expressed skepticism regarding both the authenticity and {{the ethics of}} Clonaid's procedures.

Regardless, people continue to <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> Clonaid appears to have overcome those problems; either Clonaid has been extremely lucky in discovering a superior method of cloning, or the company is making false claims.|$|E
2500|$|Earlier {{attempts}} at reconciliation of Christianity with Newtonian mechanics appear {{quite different from}} later {{attempts at}} reconciliation with the newer scientific ideas of evolution or relativity. Many early interpretations of evolution polarized themselves around a struggle for existence. These ideas were significantly countered by later findings of universal patterns of biological cooperation. According to John Habgood, all man really knows {{here is that the}} universe seems to be a mix of good and evil, beauty and pain, and that suffering may somehow be {{part of the process of}} creation. Habgood holds that Christians should not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> suffering may be used creatively by God, given their faith in the symbol of the Cross.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{reviewing}} the film at AboutFilm.com, Carlo Cavagna regards {{this as a}} misleading classification, as does Leo Goldsmith, writing at notcoming.com, and the review on Blu-ray.com. Writing in TV Guide, Maitland McDonagh writes [...] "No one familiar with the cold precision of Kubrick's work will <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> this isn't the steamy erotic thriller a synopsis (or the ads) might suggest." [...] Writing in general about the genre of 'erotic thriller' for CineAction in 2001, Douglas Keesey states that [...] "whatever [...] actual type, [...] was at least marketed as an erotic thriller". Michael Koresky, writing in the 2006 issue of film journal Reverse Shot, writes [...] "this director, who defies expectations at every turn and brings genre to his feet, was... setting out to make neither the 'erotic thriller' that the press maintained nor an easily identifiable 'Kubrick film'". DVD Talk similarly dissociates the film from this genre.|$|E
2500|$|The March 1, 2009 {{issue of}} Environmental Science and Technology {{included}} a paper by Marc Edwards, Simoni Triantafyllidou, and Dana Best that established {{a link between}} the elevated lead levels in the drinking water and potentially harmful blood lead levels in area children. The Washington Post announced the results of that study on January 27, 2009. The report found that 42,000 children who were in the womb or under age 2 during the contamination are at risk of health and behavioral problems. In some areas, the number of children with enough lead to cause irreversible IQ loss and developmental delays more than doubled between 2000 and 2003. [...] These findings contradicted previous statements by WASA that there were no health impacts, as well as the 2004 CDC MMWR report. [...] David Bellinger, a Harvard University neurologist, told the Post, [...] "If these data were available previously, I would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> anyone would be assuring the public there was no problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{burning of}} Brody had devoured {{almost half of}} the town – several hundred {{exclusively}} Jewish houses...With its old market place, the unsigned area looked impoverished and dejected. Many stores, especially the bigger one and richer ones, were locked or boarded up…The instant…I entered the market, we were surrounded by whole army of poor, ragged, famished kids, who were begging for a kopek. Most of them were Christian, but three or four were jewish. I gave each child a few kopeks, no matter what is his religion. But the instant I handed a coin to a Jew, all Christian children began shouting at me: [...] "Don’t give him anything! Don’t give him anything! He is a Jew! The children were joined by a Jewish beggar, a strange woman of about sixty. She wore a red dress, her grey hair was powdered, and her movements were nervous. She stood before me, grinning, her nasty, hungry eyes glaring at me, and she sort of danced a little. Then in a hoarse voice, mangling the language, she began warbling a sentimental Russian song, [...] "Ptichka Kanareyka", dearest little canary, about a young man who sends out a canary with a greeting for his beloved. The old beggar woman's screechy voice and outlandish appearance made a terrible impression on me. I gave her some coins and tried to hurry off. But she blocked my way, taring into my eyes and squawking her horrible song. She plainly expected me to <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> she could sing in Russian.
