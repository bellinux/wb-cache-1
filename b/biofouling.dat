5|$|Copper is biostatic, meaning {{bacteria}} {{and many other}} forms of life will not grow on it. For this reason {{it has long been}} used to line parts of ships to protect against barnacles and mussels. It was originally used pure, but has since been superseded by Muntz metal and copper-based paint. Similarly, as discussed in copper alloys in aquaculture, copper alloys have become important netting materials in the aquaculture industry because they are antimicrobial and prevent <b>biofouling,</b> even in extreme conditions and have strong structural and corrosion-resistant properties in marine environments.|$|E
25|$|As {{temperatures}} {{increase and}} water velocities decrease in marine waters, <b>biofouling</b> rates dramatically rise. However, copper’s resistance to <b>biofouling</b> is observed even in temperate waters. Studies in La Herradura Bay, Coquimbo, Chile, where <b>biofouling</b> conditions are extreme, demonstrated that a copper alloy (90% copper, 10% nickel) avoided macro-encrusting organisms.|$|E
40|$|The {{unpredictable}} {{impact of}} biofilms on friction in pipes causes difficulty in accurately designing for pipe roughness in <b>biofouled</b> pipes. The effects of biofilm growth on pipe roughness were experimentally investigated {{with the variation}} of growth conditions of velocity, diameter and water source. The results showed that differences in the growth velocity and source water altered the equivalent sand grain roughness of the <b>biofouled</b> pipes. The variation of the friction factor with Reynolds number in these <b>biofouled</b> pipes was not as expected for a rough surface and did not follow the traditional pipe friction equations. In addition, the change to the pipe velocity profile once biofilm had developed was analysed. One {{of the most important}} findings was that the Von Karman constant was significantly lower than normal in the <b>biofouled</b> pipes and that it varied with velocity. This enabled {{a modified version of the}} Colebrook-White equation to be created to describe the friction factor variation with Reynolds number in <b>biofouled</b> pipes. This research provides a basis for a method to predict the impact of biofilm development on pipe roughness.

25|$|<b>Biofouled</b> nets are {{replaced}} {{after several months}} of service, depending on environmental conditions, in a complicated, costly, and labor-intensive operation that involves divers and specialized personnel. During this process, live fish in nets must be transferred to clean pens, which causes undue stress and asphyxiation that results in some loss of fish. <b>Biofouled</b> nets that can be reused are washed on land via manual brushing and scrubbing or high-pressure water hosing. They are then dried and re-impregnated with antifouling coatings.|$|R
2500|$|To treat {{diseases}} in fish raised in <b>biofouled</b> nets, fish stocks are administered antibiotics. The antibiotics can have unwanted long-term health effects on consumers and on coastal environments near aquaculture operations.|$|R
25|$|<b>Biofouling</b> {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} {{problems}} in aquaculture. <b>Biofouling</b> occurs on non-copper materials in the marine environment, including fish pen surfaces and nettings. For example, it was noted that the open area of a mesh immersed for only seven days in a Tasmanian aquaculture operation decreased by 37% as a result of <b>biofouling.</b>|$|E
25|$|Antifouling is {{the ability}} of {{specifically}} designed materials and coatings to remove or prevent <b>biofouling</b> by any number of organisms on wetted surfaces. Since <b>biofouling</b> can occur almost anywhere water is present, <b>biofouling</b> poses risks {{to a wide variety of}} objects such as medical devices and membranes, as well as to entire industries, such as paper manufacturing, food processing, underwater construction, and desalination plants.|$|E
25|$|Other {{mechanisms}} {{impacted by}} <b>biofouling</b> include microelectrochemical drug delivery devices, papermaking and pulp industry machines, underwater instruments, fire protection system piping, and sprinkler system nozzles. In groundwater wells, <b>biofouling</b> buildup can limit recovery flow rates, {{as is the}} case in the exterior and interior of ocean-laying pipes where fouling is often removed with a tube cleaning process. Besides interfering with mechanisms, <b>biofouling</b> also occurs on the surfaces of living marine organisms, when it is known as epibiosis.|$|E
25|$|Shipping {{companies}} have historically relied on scheduled <b>biofouler</b> removal to keep such accretions to a manageable level. However, {{the rate of}} accretion can vary widely between vessels and operating conditions, so predicting acceptable intervals between cleanings is difficult.|$|R

25|$|The most {{important}} requirement for optimum <b>biofouling</b> resistance {{is that the}} copper alloys should be freely exposed or electrically insulated from less noble alloys and from cathodic protection.

This study undertook a quantitative and qualitative investigation of protein contamination of internal components from three different types of DHP: the turbine, slow speed contra-angle and surgical.

25|$|<b>Biofouling</b> adds {{enormous}} {{weight to}} submerged fish netting. Two hundredfold increases in weight have been reported. This translates, for example, to two thousand pounds of unwanted organisms adhered {{to what was}} once a clean 10-pound fish pen net. In South Australia, <b>biofouling</b> weighing 6.5 tonnes (approximately 13,000 pounds) was observed on a fish pen net.

25|$|<b>Biofouling</b> is {{also found}} in almost all {{circumstances}} where water-based liquids are in contact with other materials. Industrially important impacts are on the maintenance of mariculture, membrane systems (e.g., membrane bioreactors and reverse osmosis spiral wound membranes) and cooling water cycles of large industrial equipment and power stations. <b>Biofouling</b> can occur in oil pipelines carrying oils with entrained water, especially those carrying used oils, cutting oils, oils rendered water-soluble through emulsification, and hydraulic oils.|$|E
40|$|The {{green mussel}} (Perna viridis) was {{discovered}} in Tampa Bay in 1999 and was first noted as a <b>biofouler</b> at a power generating plant.

40|$|Biomass {{attachment}} and growth on high pressure membranes alter the surface characteristics and rejection performance of nanofiltration membranes. Along with electrostatic interaction and size exclusion, hydrophobic interaction between solutes and membrane surface play the {{major role in}} the separation process. Therefore, in attempt to properly quantify the surface energy of clean and <b>biofouled</b> membranes, different contact angle techniques were applied in this research. The surface energies of membranes were determined on dry, wet and hydrated surfaces. Results indicate that drying of the membrane surface leads to a modification of the surface properties, which are therefore not representative of the membrane in its operational conditions. Immersing the membrane in water resulted in detachment of biomass material into the surrounding liquid, thus hampering a correct estimation of the contact angle. Contact angle measurements on hydrated surfaces, on the contrary, produced reproducible results, which are consistent with current knowledge. In addition, when the values obtained by hydrated method were applied in a predictive model earlier developed, a significant improvement in predictions resulted...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{electrochemical}} characterization and microbial community analysis of closed circuit microbial fuel cells (CC-MFCs) and open circuit (OC) cells continuously fed with propionate as substrate.

The microbial communities residing in the biofilm growing on the electrode, <b>biofouled</b> cation-exchange membrane and anodic chamber liquor of OC-and CC-MFCs were characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism screening of 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries. The results show that the CC-MFC anode was enriched in several microorganisms related to known electrochemically active and dissimilatory Fe(III) reducing bacteria, mostly from the Geobacter spp., to the detriment of Bacteroidetes abundant in the OC-MFC anode. The results also evidenced the lack of a specific pelagic community in the liquor sample. The biofilm growing on the cation-exchange membrane of the CC-MFC was found to be composed of a low-diversity community dominated by two microaerophilic species of the Achromobacter and Azovibrio genus.

25|$|Historically, {{the focus}} of {{attention}} has been the severe impact due to <b>biofouling</b> on the speed of marine vessels. In some instances the hull structure and propulsion systems can become damaged. Over time, the accumulation of biofoulers on hulls increases both the hydrodynamic volume of a vessel and the frictional effects leading to increased drag of up to 60% The additional drag can decrease speeds up to 10%, which can require up to a 40% increase in fuel to compensate. With fuel typically comprising up to half of marine transport costs, <b>biofouling</b> methods are estimated to cost the shipping industry around $1 billion per year. Increased fuel use due to <b>biofouling</b> contributes to adverse environmental effects and is predicted to increase emissions of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide between 38 and 72 percent by 2020.|$|E

40|$|Aquatic Sciences Meeting, Aquatic Sciences: Global And Regional Perspectives - North Meets South, 22 - 27 February 2015, Granada, SpainHow do algae often stay so clean, {{even though}} most non-living {{surfaces}} gather “dirt” and biofilm? Most flowering-plant leaves also stay clean. In air, water and “dirt” films are repelled. Hydrophobic nm- to µm-scale grooves and pillars make leaves superhydrophic (SH), so that the water and dirt roll off in repelled droplets. Most algal cells bear a glycocalyx sculptured by fibrils of exopolymeric substance (EPS) that is often hydrophobic. Whether glycocalyxes are SH is still poorly known. Phytoplankton cultures sometimes increase (by rheology) and sometimes reduce viscosity in laminar capillary flow, possibly by SH drag reduction, a phenomenon now well known from laminar flow in capillaries with SH walls. EPS is also frequently sticky. Some copepods have structures specially to scrape algae and EPS off their feeding appendages. Can sculptured waxy cuticles on copepods show SH and help defeat sticky algal and <b>biofouler</b> attack? Fluid shearing at SH surfaces violates the no-slip assumption, and can produce a slip layer (SL) of up to several µm.

40|$|Ecological interactions, {{including}} symbiotic associations such as mutualism, parasitism and commensalism {{are crucial}} factors in generating evolutionary novelties and strategies. Direct examples of species interactions in {{the fossil record}} generally involve organisms attached to sessile organisms in an epibiont or macroboring relationship. Here we provide support for an intimate ecological association between a calcareous brachiopod (Nisusia) and the stem group mollusc Wiwaxia from the Burgess Shale. Brachiopod specimens are fixed to Wiwaxia scleritomes, the latter showing no signs of decay and disarticulation, suggesting a live association. We interpret this association as the oldest unambiguous example of a facultative ectosymbiosis between a sessile organism and a mobile benthic animal in the fossil record. The potential evolutionary advantage of this association is discussed, brachiopods benefiting from ease of attachment, increased food supply, avoidance of turbid benthic conditions, <b>biofoul</b> and possible protection from predators, suggesting commensalism (benefiting the symbiont with no impact for the host). While Cambrian brachiopods are relatively common epibionts, in particular on sponges, the association of Nisusia with the motile Wiwaxia is rare for a brachiopod species, fossil or living, and suggests that symbiotic associations were already well established and diversified by the "middle'' (Series 3, Stage 5) Cambrian...|$|R

25|$|Biocides are {{chemical}} substances that deter the microorganisms responsible for <b>biofouling.</b> The {{chemical substances}} {{are incorporated into}} an anti-fouling surface coating, typically through physical adsorption or through chemical modification of the surface. <b>Biofouling</b> occurs on surfaces after formation of a biofilm.

Other biocides are toxic to larger organisms in <b>biofouling,</b> such as the fungi and algae. The most commonly used biocide, and anti-fouling agent, is the tributyltin moiety (TBT).

Prior to settlement, cypris larvae explore surfaces by reversible attachment {{effected by}} a ‘temporary adhesive’. During this exploratory behaviour, cyprids deposit proteinaceous ‘footprints’ of a putatively adhesive material. In this study, footprints deposited by Balanus amphitrite cyprids were probed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in artificial sea water (ASW) on silane-modified glass surfaces. AFM images obtained in air yielded better resolution than in ASW and revealed the fibrillar nature of the secretion, suggesting that the deposits were composed of single proteinaceous nanofibrils, or bundles of fibrils. The force curves generated in pull-off force experiments in sea water consisted of regions of gradually increasing force, separated by sharp drops in extension force manifesting a characteristic saw-tooth appearance. Following the relaxation of fibrils stretched to high strains, force–distance curves in reverse stretching experiments could be described by the entropic elasticity model of a polymer chain. When subjected to relaxation exceeding 500 ms, extended footprint proteins refolded, and again showed saw-tooth unfolding peaks in subsequent force cycles. Observed rupture and hysteresis behaviour were explained by the ‘sacrificial bond’ model. Longer durations of relaxation (> 5 s) allowed more sacrificial bond reformation and contributed to enhanced energy dissipation (higher toughness). The persistence length for the protein chains (LP) was obtained. At high elongation, following repeated stretching up to increasing upper strain limits, footprint proteins detached at total stretched length of 10 µm...|$|R

Many compounds were found to inhibit the larval settlement of barnacle B. amphitrite significantly, such as dihydroquinolin- 2 -one-containing alkaloids from the gorgonian-derived fungus Scopulariopsis sp.

In our previous report, 49 secondary metabolites isolated from Chinese marine organisms were tested for their antifouling activities (Li et al. 2013). In present study, 55 natural products and synthesized derivatives, derived from two gorgonians, one sponge, and five symbiotic fungi collected from the South China Sea, were tested for their anti-larval settlement activities against B. amphitrite.

40|$|Background: The {{barnacle}} Balanus amphitrite is a globally distributed <b>biofouler</b> {{and a model}} {{species in}} intertidal ecology and larval settlement studies. However, a lack of genomic information has hindered the comprehensive elucidation of the molecular mechanisms coordinating its larval settlement. The pyrosequencing-based transcriptomic approach {{is thought to be}} useful to identify key molecular changes during larval settlement. Methodology and Principal Findings: Using 454 pyrosequencing, we collected totally 630, 845 reads including 215, 308 from the larval stages and 415, 537 from the adults; 23, 451 contigs were generated while 77, 785 remained as singletons. We annotated 31, 720 of the 92, 322 predicted open reading frames, which matched hits in the NCBI NR database, and identified 7, 954 putative genes that were differentially expressed between the larval and adult stages. Of these, several genes were further characterized with quantitative real-time PCR and in situ hybridization, revealing some key findings: 1) vitellogenin was uniquely expressed in late nauplius stage, suggesting it may be an energy source for the subsequent non-feeding cyprid stage; 2) the locations of mannose receptors suggested they may be involved in the sensory system of cyprids; 3) 20 kDa-cement protein homologues were expressed in the cyprid cement gland and probably function during attachment; and 4) receptor tyrosine kinases were expressed higher in cyprid stage and may be involved in signal perception during larval settlement. Conclusions: Our results provide not only the basis of several new hypotheses about gene functions during larval settlement, but also the availability of this large transcriptome dataset in B. amphitrite for further exploration of larval settlement and developmental pathways in this important marine species. © 2011 Chen et al...|$|R
