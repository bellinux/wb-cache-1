In 1897, Blériot opened a showroom for headlamps at 41 rue de Richlieu in Paris.

30|$|The {{unprecedented}} {{expansion of}} Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) {{in the last}} two decades has invigorated research in this area motivated by the emergence of a new array of LMIs, such as online job boards, social media sites, and e-recruiting firms. Evidence, largely based on U.S. data, has shown how the diffusion of the Internet has allowed the emergence of new LMIs (Stevenson 2009, Nakamura et al. 2009, <b>Bagues</b> and Sylos 2009), leading to a reallocation of job search effort (Stevenson 2009, Kuhn and Mansour 2011) and more diversified search behavior (Kroft and Pope 2009, Cahuc and Fontaine 2009).|$|E
30|$|Compared {{to other}} countries, the gender wage gap in Austria is large. According to the EU gender wage gap indicator, the {{difference}} in mean wages was about 25.5  % of men’s wages in 2008 (Europian Commission 2011). The EU gender wage gap indicator measures the average difference between men’s and women’s gross hourly earnings. 1 Of all EU countries, only the Czech Republic fared worse. To reduce this gap, Austrian policy makers required firms to disclose the wages of their workers (Bundeskanzleramt 2010). Currently, only large firms are covered by the new law, but over time also smaller firms will need to disclose their workers’ wages. In addition, affirmative action with countries such as Norway and Spain as role models is often debated. Norway, for example, requires a minimum of 40  % of each gender in publicly appointed boards and in all boards of directors in private, shareholder-owned businesses. Spain imposed a similar rule for public sector committees and boards (<b>Bagues</b> and Esteve-Volart 2007).|$|E
40|$|Connections {{appear to}} be helpful in many {{contexts}} such as obtaining a job, a promotion, a grant, a loan or publishing a paper. This {{may be due to}} favoritism or to information conveyed by connections. Attempts at identifying both effects have relied on measures of true quality, generally built from data collected long after promotion. This empirical strategy faces important limitations. Building on earlier work on discrimination, we propose a new method to identify favors and information from classical data collected at time of promotion. Under natural assumptions, we show that promotion decisions look more random for connected candidates, due to the information channel. We obtain new identification results and show how probit models with heteroscedasticity can be used to estimate the strength of the two effects. We apply our method to the data on academic promotions in Spain studied in Zinovyeva & <b>Bagues</b> (2015). We find evidence of both favors and information effects at work. Empirical results are consistent with evidence obtained from quality measures collected five years after promotion. Comment: 35 pages, 2 figures, 13 table...|$|E

40|$|This paper extends {{previous}} research on socially responsible investment (SRI) mutual funds in several directions. First, we study separately the distinct contributions of before-fee performance and fees to mutual fund net performance. Second, we investigate the pricing of SRI funds. Third, we analyze the role of management companies in the determination of SRI funds ’ performance and fees. Finally, we improve on existing methods by applying the matching estimator methodology and {{making full use of}} the panel structure of the dataset. We show that in a sample of U. S. equity funds in the period 1997 - 2005, SRI funds had higher fees and better before- and after-fee performance than comparable conventional funds. Differences, however, were driven exclusively by SRI funds run by management companies that specialize in SRI. ∗Department of Business Administration, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

30|$|Some {{patterns}} {{emerge from}} this analysis. Firstly, the impacts for monthly earnings increase overtime, which suggest that those who got jobs {{in the first month}} of treatment have lower reservation wages than those who got jobs later on. This result is consistent with standard predictions of theoretical job search models (e.g. Mortensen 1986). However, these point estimates are not statistically significant, and thus they should be taken only as suggestive evidence. Secondly, across all three months following treatment, the unrestricted-SMS treatment group shows the largest earnings impacts (30 soles, or 22 percent of the baseline earnings), while the restricted-SMS treatment group shows the lowest. This suggestive evidence reinforces the previous discussion {{about the importance of the}} extent and scope of the information sets in labor-market intermediation, since they seem to be more relevant than the information channel itself. The availability of a larger dataset or lengthier treatment duration would have helped us to provide more definitive results. From an international perspective, the empirical literature shows ambiguous effects for LMIs on matching efficiency, with some studies showing positive impacts on earnings (e.g., <b>Bagues</b> and Sylos 2009) and others a zero effect (e.g., Kroft and Pope 2009).|$|E
