5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not <b>be</b> <b>protective</b> <b>against</b> the common cold in and of itself.|$|E

25|$|These studies {{suggested}} that lamotrigine acts presynaptically on voltage-gated sodium channels to decrease glutamate release. Several electrophysiological studies {{have investigated the}} effects of lamotrigine on voltage-dependent sodium channels. For example, lamotrigine blocked sustained repetitive firing in cultured mouse spinal cord neurons in a concentration-dependent manner, at concentrations that are therapeutically relevant {{in the treatment of}} human seizures. In cultured hippocampal neurons, lamotrigine reduced sodium currents in a voltage-dependent manner, and at depolarised potentials showed a small frequency-dependent inhibition. These {{and a variety of other}} results indicate that the antiepileptic effect of lamotrigine, like that of phenytoin and carbamazepine, is at least in part due to use- and voltage-dependent modulation of fast voltage-dependent sodium currents. However, lamotrigine has a broader clinical spectrum of activity than phenytoin and carbamazepine and is recognised to <b>be</b> <b>protective</b> <b>against</b> generalised absence epilepsy and other generalised epilepsy syndromes, including primary generalised tonic–clonic seizures, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Chelation {{therapy for}} acute {{inorganic}} mercury poisoning {{can be done}} with DMSA, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), D-penicillamine (DPCN), or dimercaprol (BAL). Only DMSA is FDA-approved for use in children for treating mercury poisoning. However, several studies found no clear clinical benefit from DMSA treatment for poisoning due to mercury vapor. No chelator for methylmercury or ethylmercury is approved by the FDA; DMSA is the most frequently used for severe methylmercury poisoning, as it is given orally, has fewer side-effects, and {{has been found to be}} superior to BAL, DPCN, and DMPS. α-Lipoic acid (ALA) has been shown to <b>be</b> <b>protective</b> <b>against</b> acute mercury poisoning in several mammalian species when it is given soon after exposure; correct dosage is required, as inappropriate dosages increase toxicity. Although it has been hypothesized that frequent low dosages of ALA may have potential as a mercury chelator, studies in rats have been contradictory. Glutathione and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) are recommended by some physicians, but have been shown to increase mercury concentrations in the kidneys and the brain.|$|E

Studies have also found that moderate consumption of other alcoholic beverages is correlated with decreased mortality from cardiovascular causes, although the association is stronger for wine.

Superoxide dismutase (SOD 1), Tar-DNA binding protein- 43 (TDP- 43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) are major proteins linked to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) pathology. Whilst neurodegenerative mechanisms are not fully defined in ALS, dysfunction to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) is increasingly implicated in the pathology of the disease. Protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) is an ER chaperone which also functions as an isomerase and aids in the formation and reduction of protein disulphide bonds. It is primarily located in the ER {{but it is also}} found in other cellular locations. Our laboratory previously demonstrated that over-expression of PDI <b>is</b> <b>protective</b> <b>against</b> mutant SOD 1 in neuronal cultures. PDI has also been shown to co-localise with FUS and TDP- 43 positive inclusions in ALS patients. Here we examined whether over-expression of PDI <b>is</b> <b>protective</b> <b>against</b> mutant TDP- 43 and FUS induced ER stress and ER-Golgi transport defects and mislocalisation into cytoplasm in cellular models. Furthermore, we examined the mechanism by which PDI <b>is</b> <b>protective</b> and suggests that the disulphide interchange activity is important for its protective function. Also PDI in the cytoplasm further accentuates its protective ability. Importantly, PDI was examined in vivo and it was demonstrated that a small molecule mimic of the PDI active site - 1, 2 bis (mercaptoacetamido) cyclohexane BMC reduced the loss of motor neuron in SOD 1 G 93 A mice signifying the relevance of PDI in disease pathology. The results in this study demonstrate that PDI <b>is</b> <b>protective</b> <b>against</b> the major misfolded proteins linked to ALS; therefore the molecular mimic may be a novel therapeutic target in multiple forms of ALS.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveSymptomatic knee {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) {{is poorly}} correlated with radiographic severity, but subchondral bone measures {{may be useful}} for risk assessment as bone shape is grossly unaffected at early radiographic stages. We sought to determine whether compartment-specific size mismatch in the naturally asymmetric tibiofemoral joint, measured as tibiofemoral subchondral surface ratio (SSR) : (1) predicts incident symptoms, (2) predicts incident or progressive OA, (3) is reproducible and time invariant. DesignOA Initiative participants with baseline MRIs and up to 48 -month follow-up (n =  1, 338) were analyzed. Logistic regression {{was used to determine}} the association between SSR and incident symptoms, incident OA, and progression of OA after adjusting for demographic, radiologic, injury-related, and lifestyle-related factors. Reproducibility was assessed as % coefficient of variation (CV) on repeat MRI studies at baseline and 24 months. ResultsIncreased medial SSR <b>is</b> <b>protective</b> <b>against</b> incident symptoms at 48 months (per 0. 1 increase: OR 0. 48 CI 0. 30, 0. 75; P =  0. 001). Increased lateral SSR values <b>are</b> <b>protective</b> <b>against</b> lateral OA incidence (OR 0. 23 CI 0. 06, 0. 77; P =  0. 016) or progression (OR 0. 66 CI 0. 43, 0. 99; P =  0. 049) at 24 months. Both medial and lateral SSR are stable over time (medial: mean change 0. 001 SD 0. 016; lateral: mean change 0. 000 SD 0. 017) and are highly reproducible (3. 0 % CV medial SSR; 2. 7 % CV lateral SSR). ConclusionsA larger medial SSR <b>is</b> <b>protective</b> <b>against</b> developing OA-related symptoms. A larger lateral SSR <b>is</b> <b>protective</b> <b>against</b> lateral OA incidence or progression. Finally, lateral and medial SSR are stable over time and are highly reproducible across MRI studies...|$|R
