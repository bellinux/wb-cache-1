40|$|Observing {{ultra-low}} interest yields {{in recent}} years, {{it is often}} {{pointed out that the}} existence of "search-for-yield" behaviors of financial institutions might have been intensifying interest rate drops. One hypothesis to explain "search-for-yield" is that banks try to buy longer-term bonds even when they expect upward paths of the short-term interest rate and they recognize negative term premium in long-term rates because they care about current portfolio income, not just expected holding-period returns. A main {{purpose of this paper is}} to study implications about general equilibrium effects from the existence of banks with this type of "search-for-yield". Hanson and Stein (2015) give explanations about what these investors bring to the long-term interest rate pricing from their partial equilibrium model. I incorporate a similar setting to theirs into a general equilibrium model with banks exposed to the value at risk constraint. Implications found here are as follows. First, the existence of these banks makes recovery path after negative productivity shock hits the economy more sluggish. Second, as Hanson and Stein (2015) suggest, we observe lower term premium in the long-term bond interest rate. Third, when the fiscal authority is more sensitive to the increase in <b>bond</b> <b>outstanding,</b> these impacts become smaller...|$|E
40|$|Despite of the {{importance}} of term structure estimation for business and monetary purposes, Slovenian term structure has not yet been estimated. Partly the blame goes to underdeveloped bond market, characterized by high portion of foreign currency issues in Slovenian government <b>bond</b> <b>outstanding,</b> the lack of long term instruments and low liquidity on the secondary market. The liquidity improved with parallel OTC-DVP market introduction in September 2005 and consequently the information value of fixed income asset prices for term structure estimation purposes has improved significantly. In this paper we will present theoretical methods of static term structure estimation. The goals are to obtain initial estimates of Slovenian term structure, to identify the most suitable estimation method and to analyze the volatility movements of zero coupon yields and forward interest rates for different maturities in analyzed time period. Among applied models of term structure estimation, namely Nelson-Siegel model, Svensson model, Bsplines model, smoothing B-splines model and Merrill Lynch exponential splines model, Nelson-Siegel model proved to be superior in terms of goodness of fit measured as root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean percentage error (MPE) and hit ratio. The resulted estimates are to the knowledge of the author initial estimates of Slovenian term structure. With OTC-DVP bond market introduction (as parallel bond market) the volatility of spot and forward rates for mid and long remind maturities has fallen. Volatility reduction is important, as 10 year benchmark bond yield is closely observed as one of Maastricht’s criteria which have to be fullfield before joining the EMU. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{empirical}} performance of structural credit risk models by exam-ining the default probabilities calculated from these models with dierent time horizons. The {{parameters of the}} models are estimated from rm's bond and equity prices. The models stud-ied include Merton (1974), Merton model with stochastic interest rate, Longsta and Schwartz (1995), Leland and Toft (1996) and Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2001). The sample rms chosen are those that have only one <b>bond</b> <b>outstanding</b> when bond prices are observed. We rst nd that when the Maximum Likelihood estimation, introduced in Duan (1994), is used to estimate the Merton model from bond prices the estimated volatility is unreasonable high and the estimation process does not converge {{for most of the}} rms in our sample. It shows that the Merton (1974) is not able to generate high yields to match the empirical observations. On the other hand, when equity prices are used as input we nd nd that the default probabilities predicted for investment-grade rms by Merton (1974) are all close to zero. When stochastic interest rates are assumed in Merton model the model performance is improved. Longsta and Schwartz (1995) with constant interest rate as well as the Leland and Toft (1996) model provide quite reasonable predictions on real default probabilities when compared with those reported by Moody's and S&P. However, Collin-Dufresnce and Goldstein (2001) predicts unreasonably high default probabilities for longer time horizons.

40|$|First version March 29, 2015; This version March 15, 2016 During {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis (GFC), Japan and the U. S. differed {{in at least two}} important ways: (1) while markets were stable in Japan then, the bubbles in the U. S. housing and financial markets burst and (2) while Japanese banks suffered few losses, huge losses badly weakened U. S. banks. In addition, and unlike the U. S., Japan requires firms' balance sheets to show, not only their total debt, but also the components of their debt: bonds, loans, and other debt. We used data for listed, non-financial, Japanese firms' bonds, bank loans, and other debt to investigate whether the 2008 "Lehman shock" in the U. S. disrupted Japanese bond markets. The Japanese data al-lowed us to estimate how much the Lehman shock affected Japanese firms' <b>bonds</b> <b>outstanding</b> and issued and to estimate how much, in turn, the Lehman shock resulted in firms' getting more loans from Japanese banks. The estimates revealed important cross-currents during the crisis. Our estimates implied that, while the crisis reduced bond issuance, it was accompanied by enough more bank loans to raise total debt. During the crisis, both <b>bonds</b> <b>outstanding</b> and <b>bond</b> issuance responded less to prior bond shortfalls and responded less to their maturing bonds. Second, while it greatly reduced <b>bonds</b> issued and <b>outstanding</b> at smaller, listed firms, the crisis boosted them at the very largest firms. In contrast, bank loans then rose more at smaller firms. Third, bank loans rose more, and <b>bonds</b> <b>outstanding</b> fell more, at firms with greater exposure to foreign sales. Fourth, the crisis led firms, and especially larger firms, to hold more cash and fewer securities and to reduce costs. Fifth, capital expenditures generally declined during the crisis, but declined significantly less at larger firms...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to examine how investors {{acknowledge}} the four variables; earnings variability, period of solvency, equity/debt ratio and <b>bonds</b> <b>outstanding</b> to determine the risk premium on corporate bonds on the Swedish market. In order to achieve this knowledge we performed a quantitative study based on regression analysis and a hypothesis of Professor Lawrence Fisher. Our ambition was to replicate Fisher’s theory {{in the best possible}} manner to achieve reliable and valid results. Unfortunately, the limited supply and the illiquidity of the Swedish corporate bond market affected the validity of our research. The results of the study were inconclusive. According to our results, the investors on the Swedish market do acknowledge the length of time a company has been solvent and the amount of <b>bonds</b> <b>outstanding</b> of a firm when determining the risk premium of corporate bonds.

40|$|Our paper {{explores the}} risks that arise due to {{indebtedness}} of Hungarian local governments. Our analysis relies on interviews conducted with {{the heads of the}} local government business branches of the credit institutions most important in terms of local government financing and on the related data collections, as well as on data from the Hungarian State Treasury regarding the financial management of local governments and on data from banks. Until 2011, the repayment of the bonds issued during the bond issue boom experienced in the local government sector in 2007 – 2008 started only in the case of one third of the <b>bonds</b> <b>outstanding.</b> However, by the end of 2011 year nearly 50 per cent and by end- 2013 90 per cent of total <b>bonds</b> <b>outstanding</b> will reach the principal repayment period. Due to the considerable foreign exchange exposure of total loans and <b>bonds</b> <b>outstanding</b> (60 per cent, 80 per cent of which is Swiss franc exposure) {{as well as to the}} declining revenues of local governments and the deteriorating economic prospects, it is doubtful that local governments will be able to repay their debts to the banking sector in line with the original maturities. Therefore local governments financing may have an effect not only on the fiscal position but on the whole financial system as well. Nevertheless, our partial analysis establishes that the risks related to the debt of the local government sector have increased significantly in the recent period, but these risks could be managed by the banks. The comprehensive restructuring of the local government system as a whole and a further changing of debt settlement procedures by the government may influence the financial position of the local government system. In parallel with the regrouping of tasks, transferring of a portion of local government debt (primarily from the county local governments) to the central budget may result in a clear picture. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} whether {{eliminating the}} stock of government debt outstanding would reduce welfare. It models an economy with three assets—currency, government bonds, and storage, a transactions role for money, and a demand for liquidity and thus a role for banks. The Friedman rule is not optimal in this economy, so there is potentially a role for interest-bearing, risk-free government bonds. Because the government must raise enough revenue to meet its interest obligations on any <b>bonds</b> <b>outstanding,</b> the social value of government debt hinges on whether the benefits from greater portfolio diversification outweigh {{the costs associated with}} the necessary revenue-raising efforts. The paper shows that a positive stock of government debt is optimal only if interest payments on the debt are financed via money creation, agents are not too risk averse, there is a primary government budget deficit, and the economy is operating on the bad side of the Laffer curve. But under these conditions, welfare would be even higher if monetary policy were conducted to put the economy on the good side of the Laffer curve and there were no government <b>bonds</b> <b>outstanding.</b> Thus, there is little support for keeping a stock of interest-bearing, risk-free government debt outstanding.

Abstract: This paper investigates to {{what extent}} the {{practice}} by rating agencies and international banks of not rating companies higher than the sovereign (“country ceiling rule”) is reflected in market prices of South African local currency denominated debt.

The main findings are, first, that the “country ceiling ” (in local-currency terms) does not hold for all 9 companies analyzed, {{in the sense that the}} yields of their rand-denominated <b>bonds</b> <b>outstanding</b> increase less than 1 % when government bonds yields rise by the same amount. Accordingly, the elasticity of corporate spreads with respect to sovereign spreads results significantly lower than 1 (approximately 0. 83).
