Multivariate Statistical Analysis (i. e.

The use of Voronoi diagrams is also suggested as a technique that could affect criteria which are linked with the location of a potential supplier. We believe that the proposed model could end up in improving supplier selection procedures as it integrates contemporary approaches seen in the relevant academic literature with some of the particularities of the Armed Forces...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how Pennsylvania public school districts decide to offer full-day or half- day kindergarten {{and the effects}} of related state policies on decision-making. All 499 of Pennsylvania‟s superintendents from school districts that offer kindergarten received survey invitations, and 162 leaders from Pennsylvania‟s public schools completed a survey that focused on how districts‟ decided to provide full- or half-day kindergarten for the 2014 - 2015 school year, the influence of funding specifically, {{and the effects of}} Pennsylvania‟s compulsory school age. The researcher also analyzed kindergarten enrollment from 2003 to the present, specifically examining the change in kindergarten program type with respect to the overall socioeconomic status (SES) of students served, in relation to the availability of Accountability Block Grant funds, which were commonly have been used to create and sustain full-day kindergarten programs. Money was an important factor in decision-making among school districts planning to offer full-day kindergarten and those planning to offer half-day kindergarten. A lack of available funds was a chief factor in most school districts‟ decision to offer half-day kindergarten, although this was less so for school districts in the highest SES categories. School districts offering full-day kindergarten indicated multiple important factors in their decision, most commonly indicating factors supporting academic outcomes for students who attend full-day programs. The availability of money was also an important factor among participants who indicated that their school districts intended to offer full-day kindergarten for the coming year, and participants indicated ways that their districts ensured the availability of funds through <b>budgetary</b> <b>reduction</b> strategies.

Also, parent involvement in public schools and auxil-iaries in public hospitals (as well as private ones) have been common.

40|$|ManagementAs the Army {{continues}} to face force and budget reductions {{while maintaining a}} high state of readiness, reliance on advanced technology systems is becoming more essential.

This thesis explores {{the application of the}} built in test (BIT) maintenance concept in supporting readiness in the Fire Control System (FCS) of the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). It provides background on the current Fire Control System and discusses factors both internal and external to the system that are driving the upgrade. Projected benefits gained from BIT are in terms of readiness through reduction in Mean Time To Repair (MTTR), cost savings, and compression of the maintenance levels. Application of BIT into other systems is covered.

We examined whether <b>budgetary</b> <b>reductions</b> in pension credit and social care {{have been associated with}} recent rises in mortality rates among pensioners aged 85 and over. Design Cross-local authority longitudinal study Setting 324 lower tier local authorities in England Main outcome measure Annual percentage changes in mortality rates among pensioners aged 85 years or over. Results Between 2007 and 2013, each 1 % decline in pension credit spending (support for low income pensioners) per beneficiary was associated with an increase of 0. 68 % in old age mortality (95 % CI: 0. 41 to 0. 95). Each {{reduction in the number of}} beneficiaries per 1000 pensioners was associated with an increase of 0. 20 % (95 % CI: 0. 15 to 0. 24). Each 1 % decline in social care spending was associated with a significant rise in old-age mortality (0. 08 %, 95 % CI: 0. 0006 to 0. 12), but not after adjusting for pension credit spending. Similar patterns were seen inboth men and women. Weaker associations observed for those aged 75 to 84, and none among those 65 to 74. Categories of service expenditure not expected to affect old age mortality, such as transportation, showed no association. Conclusions Rising mortality rates among pensioners aged 85 and over were linked to reductions in spending on income support for poor pensioners and social care.

40|$|The {{school board}} {{of a school}} {{district}} in South Carolina has proposed to increase class size in all schools due to mandatory <b>budgetary</b> <b>reductions.</b> However, at the secondary school level, {{the literature on the}} effect of larger class size on student achievement is conflicting. The theoretical framework by Lazear suggested that the minimization of negative externalities (i. e., problematic behavioral and academic characteristics of students) achieved through the mechanism of smaller class size impacts student learning. Reducing the number of students in a classroom alters the entire classroom environment, creating a more positive learning environment in which students are able to forge better relationships with classmates and teachers. The research question for this study examined whether class size in secondary school predicted student achievement as measured by teacher-issued end-of-course numerical student grades (TIECNSG). The study used a correlational design with a sample of 17, 582 TIECNSG from 5 secondary schools in the district. The effect of smaller class sizes on TIECNSG was determined {{through the use of a}} linear regression model. For 9 course offerings, an increase in class size resulted in a decrease in TIECNSG, whereas for 8 course offerings, an increase in class size resulted in an increase in TIECNSG. The results of this study, therefore, were inconclusive, suggesting that other unaccounted confounding variables may have affected student achievement. This study can be used to promote positive social change by creating a dialogue between parents and school administrators who often have opposing points of view in terms of the effects of class size. In addition, it is recommended that a district 2 ̆ 7 s school board should authorize additional studies prior to taking any course of action that would affect class size at the secondary school level...|$|R

In this time of <b>budgetary</b> <b>reductions,</b> mental health care delivery systems have been forced to seek alternate ways of providing services. In 1979 the Illinois Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities developed and implemented a deinstitutionalization program. Essentially, the program seeks to prevent unnecessary admissions to and retention in state-operated residential facilities, to provide appropriate treatment alternatives in the community, and {{to improve the quality of}} care within state-operated residential facilities. The number of inpatient days and the number of first admissions to state-operated residential facilities have been considered as indicators of the effectiveness of the deinstitutionalization program. The subjects in the present study were the elderly persons (age 65 and older), who were first admissions to the Elgin Mental Health Center (a state-operated residential facility), during the period July 1, 1979 through June 30, 1982. The present study examined the question, "Among the elderly who were first admissions to the Elgin Mental Health Center, is there a relationship between selected variables and length of hospital stay?" The selected variables were the age of the subjects at admission, and the subjects' scores on the 10 factors measured by the Physical and Mental Impairment-of-Function Evaluation Scale (PAMIE Scale). The present study found that the best predictors for length of hospital stay were these 5 PAMIE Subscale scores: Belligerent/Irritable, Anxious/Depressed, Behaviorally Deteriorated, Self/Care dependent, and Mentally Disorganized/Confused. With these 5 independent variables in the equation, 35. 8 % of the variance in the dependent variable (length of hospital stay) was explained. The present study also examined adverse effects associated with relocation and hospitalization. No evidence was found to support the existence of these effects. There was no comparison group, so generalization beyond the subjects in the present study would be inappropriate. However, the findings provide a base with which the Department can begin to assess part of its deinstitutionalization program...|$|R
