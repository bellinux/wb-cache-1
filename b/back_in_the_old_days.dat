[...] "You can put a fortune into drains and fences and buildings, but it's quite another matter to get two or three per cent, upon it <b>back.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> I hadn't a horse in the stables worth less than sixty guineas, and my father thought nothing of giving twice as much. The other things were to match." [...] He looked down the table with a flush of indignation in his heavy face. [...] "Now, Walters at the George gives a navvy the horse I hired. Still, what can you expect when they pile up the taxes on us, and open new doors continually to the foreigners? We grew wheat at Scarthwaite, and it was ground at Ramside mill. The last time I looked in, Harvey had his stores full of flour from Minneapolis and Winnipeg. I asked him whether he didn't feel ashamed of having any hand in that kind of thing." ...|$|E

6000|$|Another {{cause of}} the mild kind of {{happiness}} I now experienced was the consciousness {{of a change in}} my own mental disposition, which made me less of an alien in the house; for I was now able, I imagined, to appreciate the beautiful character of my friends, their crystal purity of heart and the religion they professed. Far <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> I had heard, first and last, a great deal about sweetness and light and Philistines, and not quite knowing what this grand question was all about, and hearing from some of my friends that I was without the qualities they valued most, I thereafter proclaimed myself a Philistine, and was satisfied to have the controversy ended in that way, so far as it concerned me personally. Now, however, I was like one to whom some important thing has been told, who, scarcely hearing and straightway forgetting, goes about his affairs; but, lying awake at night in the silence of his chamber, recalls the unheeded words and perceives their full significance. My sojourn with this people--angelic women and mild-eyed men with downy, unrazored lips, so mild in manner yet in their arts [...] "laying broad bases for eternity"--above all the invalid hours spent daily in the Mother's Room, had taught me how unlovely a creature I had been. It would have been strange indeed if, in such an atmosphere, I had not absorbed a little sweetness and light into my system.|$|E

A song from these sessions, the Pavement influenced How Popular You Are, started picking up radio on BBC Radio One in the UK and the band decided to form their own record company, Brigadier Records, to release it as a single. The song, described by the BBC as [...] "quirky guitar pop", [...] was supported by Phill Jupitus and Huw Stephens and backed with a song from the same Jim Riley sessions, the chiming <b>Back</b> <b>In</b> <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Days.</b> The release saw the band's first artwork collaboration with Christoff Spurr, who {{has gone on to}} design all of the band's sleeves since. The single proved to be a big breakthrough for the band, who were then invited to record a Maida Vale session for BBC Radio One. Brigadier Ambrose followed this up with a small tour of England, a highlight being the Latitude Festival (travelling to which some of the band were involved in a motorway crash with a juggernaut).|$|E
50|$|Brown Television {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{historically}} rich organizations at Brown University. It began in 1987 founded by Doug Liman, now Hollywood director of “The Bourne Identity” and “Jumper”, among others. It was a student run television network running student made productions both for news and entertainment <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> of analog UHF equipment and tape decks. Over time, technological advancements left BTV in the dust. The old analog equipment started to fail and BTV became nothing more than a channel on Brown’s IPTV network broadcasting movies distributed by Swank. This, however, also ended due to contract disputes between Swank’s clients and the use of IPTV for the distribution of the movies. BTV had become nothing more than an empty room with missing and broken equipment and a channel broadcasting a blackscreen 24 hours a day. A group of determined students decided to re-vamp BTV in the late 2000s. At the same time, another small but passionate group of students was trying to reestablish the Brown Film Society’s old production outfit, Brown Film Production. These two groups eventually realized their common goals and agreed upon collaboration and in Spring 2008 the Undergraduate Finance Board allocated the necessary funds to powerfully and tangibly start the reconstruction of Brown TV.|$|E
50|$|Some {{of the key}} {{positions}} on the team are Net Centre (or netty). He is responsible for lifting and/or digging {{the ball out of}} the net on a second touch. In the old days, the netty was encouraged to lift the ball up and over the net to the opposing team. As the years went by and the variant styles of the game were changing, the netty was encouraged to lift the ball back to his team so that they could strike the ball (third touch) to the opposing side and keep the volley going. There was usually one netty per team <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days.</b> Today, teams are allowed to play with up to two nettys simultaneously, or even a third netty on the far right or left corners of the net-thus preventing an advantage of the opposing team to drop or 'dink' the ball. The short centre spot is a position that was previously called the 'sweeper'. This position was put into fruition in Canada some years ago, and the object of the short centre is to strike the ball into the net as much as he can, so that the netty can give a nice, high, clean lift to his team to strike back to the opposing side.|$|E

According to his own statement, Conan proved compatible with his talents: [...] "was the only Marvel character who did not fly, did not breathe fire and did not use psychic waves to defeat his enemies, being instead armed with a giant sword and axe.

This was mainly due to the belief that the majority of Chinese held, that their stay in America was just a temporary one, solely to acquire money. They were termed as sojourners, as most who made the journey over were males, either with a family <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> country awaiting their return, or were young Chinese looking to make their fortune and retire easy <b>back</b> <b>in</b> their homeland.|$|R
