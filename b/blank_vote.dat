25|$|A notable {{feature of}} the early polls was the high {{percentage}} of people intending to cast a <b>blank</b> <b>vote</b> (voto en blanco), usually between 20% and 30%. This reflected the widespread dissatisfaction among the Colombian public with all the candidates and the political system in general. After the parliamentary elections and the election of Peñalosa as candidate for the Green Alliance, both of which occurred on March 9, 2014, the polls showed {{a sharp drop in}} the percentage of people intending to cast a <b>blank</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|E

25|$|After the 1981 {{election}} of President François Mitterrand (Socialist Party, PS) (during {{which he called}} for <b>blank</b> <b>vote),</b> the Abbé Pierre supported the initiative of the French Premier Laurent Fabius (PS) to create in 1984 the Revenu minimum d'insertion (RMI), a welfare system for indigents.|$|E
50|$|In {{previous}} elections, {{the mass}} media usually counted and displayed null and <b>blank</b> <b>votes</b> as contenders in running tallies from exit polls and final results, both infographically and in spoken language. In contrast to former election processes, this time the media spent almost no time reporting null and <b>blank</b> <b>votes.</b> Infographics and spoken reports simply discounted null and <b>blank</b> <b>votes,</b> electing to sum only non-null votes.|$|R
5000|$|In Spanish electoral law, a {{distinction}} is made between valid <b>votes,</b> <b>blank</b> <b>votes</b> (...) and null <b>votes.</b> <b>Blank</b> <b>votes</b> are interpreted as correctly executed votes for [...] "none of the above", and consistently about 2% of <b>votes</b> are <b>blank.</b> Voting [...] "blank" [...] {{is not the}} same thing as abstaining, and so it has been argued that <b>blank</b> <b>votes</b> should be recognized as legitimate by apportioning empty seats in representative bodies according to the number of <b>blank</b> <b>votes.</b> Abstainers, the argument continues, exclude themselves from the democratic process and so need not be recognized in this way.|$|R
50|$|There were 172 <b>blank</b> <b>votes</b> cast.|$|R
25|$|Leftist {{organizations}} like Abnaa al-Balad made abstention and the <b>blank</b> <b>vote</b> {{the center of}} their political campaigns in the 1999 elections. Although voter turnout increased by just over 30,000, the percentage turnout (70%) was down slightly (reflecting a population increase), and well below predictions of 87%.|$|E
25|$|With the {{election}} {{being the first}} time a second round was needed, it became apparent the electoral law was imprecise on the rule of campaigning in between the two round. The lack of clear rule was interpreted by the General Commission for Elections (GCE) as an interdiction on political campaign. Sainkhüügiin Ganbaatar, who narrowly missed the second round, began a campaign calling to cast a <b>blank</b> <b>vote,</b> so as to have none of the remaining candidate reach the 50% threeshold needed, leading to a new election. While not a campaign for a candidate per se, this was nonetheless ruled by the GCE as an electoral campaign, and thus forbidden. In the second round, 99,494 <b>blank</b> <b>vote</b> were gathered, totalling 8.23% of the total of valid votes, failing close to the intended result by a few thousands votes.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010 Australian election, Mark Latham urged Australians to vote informally by handing in blank ballot {{papers for}} the 2010 election. He {{also stated that}} he doesn't feel it is fair for the {{government}} to force citizens to vote if they don't have an opinion or threaten them into voting with a fine. An Australian Electoral Commission spokesman stated that the Commonwealth Electoral Act did not contain an explicit provision prohibiting the casting of a <b>blank</b> <b>vote.</b> How the Australian Electoral Commission arrived at this opinion is unknown; it runs contrary to the opinions of Chief Justice Sir Garfield Barwick, who wrote that voters must actually mark the ballot paper and deposit that ballot into a ballot box, and Justice Blackburn who was of the opinion that casting an invalid vote was a violation of the Act.|$|E

5000|$|Being {{strongly}} against the referendum, the Barisan Sosialis {{called for a}} boycott of the referendum, telling supporters to submit <b>blank</b> <b>votes</b> in protest of the [...] "rigged" [...] referendum. Over 144,000 <b>blank</b> <b>votes</b> were cast, {{over a quarter of}} all votes. This move had been anticipated by the ruling PAP government, as seen by the insertion of a clause that stated that all blank would be counted as a vote for the option that wins the most votes if there was no outright majority or that <b>blank</b> <b>votes</b> would be counted as Option A.|$|R
50|$|There were 783 <b>blank</b> <b>votes</b> and 420 invalid ballots.|$|R
2500|$|A {{surprising}} {{amount of}} opposition to the law arose {{at the end of}} May. Parts of the Social Liberal Youth, Enhedslisten and republican circles advocate a <b>blank</b> <b>vote,</b> effectively having the same effect as a no vote. Others argued a <b>blank</b> <b>vote</b> because it would improve possibilities for a future in-depth constitutional reform. Some people argued for drawing an extra [...] "Republic" [...] box on the ballot or writing the words [...] "Republic Now!" [...] on it, which would render a spoilt vote.|$|E
2500|$|Abstention was {{exceptionally}} low, {{as well as}} protest votes. <b>Blank</b> <b>vote</b> (going to vote, but deliberately cancelling one's ballot, by {{any means}} possible – tearing it in two, writing Tintin on it, or anything absurd as such) {{is not included in}} official counts – i.e. it is considered a spoilt vote, counted as equivalent to abstention. A very small party, the Parti Blanc (White Party, for [...] "white vote", i.e. <b>blank</b> <b>vote)</b> has called for the official count of white votes by the state (as in None of the above systems). It organised a march in Paris on Wednesday 18 March 2007 in which only thirty people participated.|$|E
2500|$|After being {{eliminated}} {{in the first}} round, both François Fillon and Benoît Hamon called to vote for Emmanuel Macron, while Jean-Luc Mélenchon refused to pronounce in favor of either candidate, preferring to first consult activists from his movement. Jean Lassalle and Nathalie Arthaud opted to cast a <b>blank</b> <b>vote,</b> Philippe Poutou and François Asselineau gave no voting instructions, and Jacques Cheminade only stated that he would personally refuse to vote for Le Pen and denounced the forces of [...] "financial occupation". Nicolas Dupont-Aignan endorsed Le Pen during the evening of 28 April, and was subsequently revealed as her choice for Prime Minister the following day. On 2 May, the result of Mélenchon's consultation was published, with 36.12% voting for a <b>blank</b> <b>vote,</b> 34.83% supporting a vote for Macron, and 29.05% opting to abstain; Mélenchon, for his part, issued no voting instructions, only urging his supporters {{not to make the}} [...] "terrible error" [...] of voting for Le Pen. Jean-Marie Le Pen supported his daughter.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, Jagland was reelected to {{a fourth}} {{term in the}} Norwegian Parliament. Jørgen Kosmo, the {{previous}} President of the Storting, had not stood for parliamentary re-election, and Jagland was elected to this position {{by the members of}} parliament on 10 October 2005.

2500|$|A {{military}} {{ban on the}} Popular Front {{organized by}} Perón and Frondizi led to their joint call for blank voting {{as a means of}} protest. The moderately anti-Peronist UCRP was also hampered by former President Pedro Aramburu's candidacy, which made opposition to Perón central to its platform. Ultimately, however, Illia would win, and despite carrying only a fourth of the vote, he also [...] "defeated" [...] the <b>blank</b> <b>vote</b> option (a proxy for the Perón vote) by 4 points.|$|E
2500|$|Silvio Berlusconi was {{the most}} vocal {{opponent}} of any candidate {{that came from the}} former Italian Communist Party, in line with the anti-communist stance he had taken in the campaign. His allies, especially the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC), openly disagreed with his intransigence but vowed to stick with their ally's decision. Yet, when Napolitano was elected, Silvio Berlusconi gave an interview to one of his political magazines Panorama saying that the UDC betrayed him by letting 60 of his electors cast a <b>blank</b> <b>vote</b> on the first ballot, instead of supporting the official candidate Gianni Letta. When the UDC argued that this might have spelt the end of the Coalition, Silvio Berlusconi quickly changed his stance by saying, as he often had, that he had been [...] "misunderstood" [...] and that he never gave that journalist an interview.|$|E
