5|$|At 21:30 Forte and the {{captured}} merchant ships were visible from Sybille, Forte brilliantly illuminated {{in the tropical}} night. Cooke brought Sybille westwards {{in order to take}} the weather gage before wearing and <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the French ship, under a light wind from the southwest. Despite the illumination on the French ship, Sybilles sails were clearly identified on Forte but Beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action: he seems to have thought that the sails belonged to an approaching East Indiaman despite the concerns of his officers, or that he wished to lure Sybille close enough to ensure its defeat in the coming engagement.|$|E
5|$|Having finally eluded his pursuers, Bompart made {{directly}} for Lough Swilly where the landing {{was scheduled to}} take place. Unaware of the rebellion's defeat, he hoped that Humbert's army would be operating in the Lough Swilly area, as intended in the campaign planned before Humbert left France. Arriving off the coast, Bompart searched for a suitable landing site {{but was unable to}} find one before dark on 10 October. He waited out the night close to Tory Island, but was surprised the next day by sails on the horizon; Warren's squadron had been joined by Countess's ships, and an overwhelming force was <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the French. Abandoning all notions of landing the troops, Bompart hauled his ships close to the wind to give them room to manoeuvre and allow their captains as much opportunity as possible to escape the approaching British.|$|E
5|$|Laforey {{immediately}} advanced on {{the strange}} sails, which were soon {{revealed to be}} Castor and the Dutch merchant ship. With Carysfort <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> him L'Huillier cast off the tow and prepared for battle, meeting the approaching British frigate with a broadside. The engagement was fought at close range and with little manoeuvering by either side, the ships exchanging broadsides {{for an hour and}} fifteen minutes before L'Huillier surrendered. His ship was heavily battered in the exchange, with the main topgallantmast knocked down and the mainmast and hull severely damaged. Carysfort suffered just one man killed and four wounded from the understrength crew of 180, while casualties were much heavier among the approximately 200 men aboard Castor, the French losing 16 men killed and nine wounded. The Dutch ship initially escaped, but was later captured and its value was eventually included in the prize money paid for Castor.|$|E

60|$|She did {{not mean}} to do so. She evidently meant to turn the tables by <b>bearing</b> {{suddenly}} <b>down</b> <b>on</b> us, and, if possible, give us a broadside before we could get out of range. The captain saw the intention instantly, and thwarted it.|$|R
5|$|With Tropical Storm Cristobal <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the {{recovery}} team, {{and time and}} money running out, the team {{made the decision to}} raise the turret on 5 August 2002, after 41 days of work, and the gun turret broke the surface at 5:30pm to the cheers of everyone aboard Wotan and other recovery ships nearby. As archaeologists examined the contents of the turret after it has been landed aboard Wotan, they discovered a second skeleton, but removing it did not begin until the turret arrived at the Mariners' Museum for conservation. The remains of these sailors were transferred to the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, in the hope that they could be identified.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the viewer}} {{backlash}} Animal Planet received for allowing meerkats from the Meerkat Manor series to die, the producers of the film debated including the filmed death of a young meerkat who was bitten by a snake. They questioned whether viewers would understand that the meerkats were wild animals and that human interference would disrupt the animals' natural life cycles. In addition, to avoid disrupting the research, crews are only allowed to film within the research area under a strictly enforced agreement not {{to interfere with the}} meerkats' lives. The producers ultimately included the scene, but the meerkat's cries for help as it lay dying were edited out. Other meerkat deaths depicted were reenactments. For Viale's death scene, the crew rigged a camera mounted on a platform {{on the side of a}} truck. Robin Smith, the film and series main cinematographer, hung partially out of the truck to hold the camera steady, giving the visual impression of a truck <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a meerkat. To provide bird and snake footage, professional handlers were employed, ensuring the meerkats were not deliberately put in danger.|$|E
5|$|In the fifth-round match, {{the teams}} saw out a 0–0 draw at Maine Road, and the match was replayed at Anfield. Goals from Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone gave Manchester City a 2–1 lead, {{but the game}} {{finished}} in controversial circumstances when the referee blew his whistle for full time as Liverpool's Billy Liddell was <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> goal. Liddell put {{the ball in the}} net, but unbeknown to him the goal did not count as the match was already over. In the quarter final Manchester City again played opposition from Liverpool, facing Everton at Maine Road. Trailing 1–0 at half-time after a Jimmy Harris goal, City overcame the deficit in the second half with goals from Hayes and Johnstone. Further controversy followed in the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, when in the final minutes of the match, with the score at 1–0 to Manchester City, Tottenham were denied a penalty after goalkeeper Trautmann grabbed forward George Robb's leg. No further goalscoring opportunities occurred, and City hung on for the victory.|$|E

5|$|On July 4, David {{demonstrates}} {{that the key to}} defeating the aliens lies in deactivating their force fields, and devises a way to do so by uploading a computer virus into the mothership. He proposes using the refurbished alien fighter to implement the plan, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The two are able to upload the virus and deploy a nuclear weapon on board the mothership. With military pilots in short supply, Thomas enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, and leads an attack on a saucer <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> Area 51. With the aliens' shields deactivated, the fighters are able to inflict damage, but their supply of missiles is quickly exhausted. As the saucer prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but his attempt of firing it jams, leaving him no choice but to sacrifice his own life. He flies his plane kamikaze-style into the directed-energy weapon port, which results in an explosion that destroys the saucer. Human resistance forces around the world successfully destroy the other saucers using this vulnerability. As humankind is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They and military officers nearby accompany Thomas and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the mothership burn up, resembling a fireworks display as it enters Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The Batavian captain, finding {{such a large}} force <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> him, {{ordered the}} brigs and cutter to {{separate}} from the frigate, turning with the wind {{in an effort to}} escape with Donnelly close behind. He also turned Argo away from the pursuing Phoenix, but was unable to decide whether to fight or flee and as a result changed course a number of times. This inevitably slowed his ship, and at 08:15 Phoenix was able to come alongside with the advantage of the weather gage. Halstead fired a shot across the Batavian ship's bow as a warning to surrender to such overwhelming odds, but the Batavian captain refused and opened fire on the British frigate. Although Argo made strenuous efforts to escape during the exchange of fire, Halstead's ship was both more accurate and effective, mounting 36 18-pounder cannon and 8 32-pounder carronades to the Batavian frigate's 12-pounder main battery supplemented with a number of cannon of lower calibres. In just 20 minutes, Phoenix had torn much of Argos rigging, sails and masts and inflicted heavy casualties of eight killed and 28 wounded. With his ship damaged, Duncan's fleet in sight and Leopard not far behind Phoenix, the Batavian captain surrendered at 08:35, allowing Halstead to take possession of his vessel.|$|E

Moreover, it had to be inserted underwater to prevent trapping air bubbles, and cocaine administered to anaesthetise the eye, but he did however lay the groundwork for later researchers and his ideas and recommendations on fit, tear flow and rounded edges still form the basis for contact lens fitting today.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} supper had been eaten {{and the things}} cleared away, they were well down the bay, off the marshes behind which Redwood City clustered.

25|$|On January 7, 881, al-Muwaffaq set {{out from}} Wasit and {{advanced}} upon al-Ahwaz, taking the road to al-Sus. With the rebels' position in Iraq becoming increasingly precarious, and with al-Muwaffaq <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> 'Ali ibn Aban's position, the Zanj leader decided to recall 'Ali and have him return to al-Mukhtarah.

25|$|While Hurricane Irma was <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> south Florida on September 8, 2017, {{an opinion}} piece in The New York Times {{observed}} that Turkey Point {{is vulnerable to}} the threat of a storm-caused nuclear meltdown. The Turkey Point nuclear power station sits on an exposed island in Biscayne Bay, about 25 miles south of Miami. Built in the early 1970s, the aging plant depends on similar vulnerable backup systems to prevent a meltdown as those of Japan’s Fukushima plant. Although Turkey Point’s main reactors are 20 feet above sea level, the plant’s diesel-powered backup generators, which keep cooling water circulating through the reactors when power is knocked out, are less elevated and less well insulated, according to Phil Stoddard, the mayor of South Miami.|$|E
25|$|Joseph and Jourdan posted Gazan's Army of the South and d'Erlon's Army of the Center {{to cover}} Valladolid and Segovia, while Reille with the {{remaining}} 17,000 troops from the Army of Portugal {{was sent to the}} north to help suppress guerillas. At this time, Clausel's 20,000 soldiers were located near Pamplona, far to the east. Hill's wing seized Salamanca on 26 May 1813, chasing Eugene-Casimir Villatte's French troops out of the city and capturing 200 French soldiers. Meanwhile, Graham's soldiers forded the flooding Esla River at Almendra on 31 May, losing some men to drowning and much equipment. Augustin Darricau, whose division held Zamora, had sent a cavalry reconnaissance to the west on 20 May that reported no enemy activity. The French horsemen just missed Graham, who crossed the Douro soon afterward. Finally alerted that 64,000 men were <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> Zamora from the northwest, Darricau bolted to the east, leaving Graham to occupy the town on the morning of 2 June.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Willich wheeled to {{the north}} and began {{crushing}} the flank of Anderson's division. Willich's success assisted Beatty's brigade to get to the top. The two brigades first drove off Brig. Gen. Arthur M. Manigault's men and continued rolling north. As they came up the ridge, the Union brigades of Turchin, Van Derveer, and Phelps (who was killed near the crest) added their weight to the assault against the Confederate brigades of Brig. Gens. Zachariah C. Deas, Alfred J. Vaughan, and John K. Jackson. Some Confederate soldiers resisted stubbornly, but many panicked and ran when they realized that Union troops were <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> them from the flank. Often, the Southern infantry fled before the supporting artillerists could escape with their cannons. In this manner, Anderson's entire division and Cheatham's left flank brigades of Brig. Gens. Jackson and Moore were routed. The northward Federal advance was only stopped by the stout fighting of Walthall's brigade and nightfall. Cheatham, Gist, Stevenson, and Cleburne were able to get their divisions away more or less intact, although the Confederate soldiers were demoralized and chagrined by their defeat.|$|E
25|$|With Calder's fleet patrolling off Cape Finisterre in {{anticipation}} of the arrival of the combined Franco-Spanish fleet under Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, Prowse and the Sirius, in company with HMS Egyptienne were despatched to scout for the enemy. Villeneuve had been reported as having arrived in the area and on 22 July Prowse located the allied feet, with the frigate Siréne at the rear, towing a captured merchant. Prowse closed on the Siréne, intending to cut her off and board her, but Villeneuve ordered his ships to wear in succession and reverse their course to meet Calder's advancing fleet. Prowse suddenly found himself facing the entire combined fleet, which was fast <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> him, led by the Spanish Admiral Federico Gravina aboard the Argonauta. With his tiny frigate heavily outclassed, Prowse began to beat away to leeward as the fleet passed him on the opposite tack. Gravina, aware of the convention that a ship of the line did not open fire on a frigate, ordered that the Sirius not be fired upon and the next Spanish ships also held fire. Shortly afterwards Calder's van came into range of the fleet and a general action ensued, whereby the Sirius was fired on by the España and had two men killed and three wounded. After the battle Prowse was sent to Plymouth with the captured Spanish 74-gun Firme in tow.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals placed Fedde on the 10-day {{disabled}} list on September 4 and recalled starting pitcher A. J. Cole from Syracuse, along with catcher Pedro Severino. Fedde was listed with a flexor strain {{in his right}} throwing arm, an injury expected to rule him out {{for the remainder of}} the season. Cole got the start on September 4 against the division rival Miami Marlins and earned the win in the 7−2 contest, in which Read notched his first career hit by chopping an infield single deflected off the glove of pitcher Jarlin García. Inserted in the ninth inning as a defensive substitute in left field, Alejandro De Aza leaped to take a home run away from Marlins pinch-hitter Tyler Moore to end the game. Posting six shutout innings while leading the Nationals to a 2−1 victory over Miami on September 5, starter Stephen Strasburg set a new team record for consecutive innings without allowing a run, at 26. Washington finished off the series with an 8−1 rout of the Marlins, their eighth victory against their second-place division rival in a row, in front of a crowd Reuters estimated at fewer than 800 at first pitch on September 6, with Hurricane Irma <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> South Florida and an evacuation order in place. Rookie Dillon Peters, starting on the mound for the Marlins, received his first career decision with the loss. Zimmerman homered off Peters on a count of three balls and no strikes, the first time in his 12-year major league career he had notched a hit in that count.|$|E
500|$|On July 1, 1951, Feller {{recorded}} his third career no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers.

I tried to keep it {{in the back of my}} mind, <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> and concentrating <b>on</b> one hitter at a time", Feller said. Feller was the third pitcher, after Larry Corcoran and Cy Young, to record three career no-hitters. He became the first pitcher of the 1951 season to reach 20 wins after he pitched a shutout against the Washington Senators on August 21. Along with Early Wynn and Mike Garcia, Feller reached the 20-win mark during the season; they were the first trio of pitchers on the same staff to earn 20 wins since 1931. Feller was named the Sporting News Pitcher of the Year.|$|R
