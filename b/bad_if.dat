25|$|By {{the time}} of the Renaissance, décolletage became very fashionable. There was some status to firm breasts in upper class women, who did not breast feed.

25|$|A 2-dimensional compact {{connected}} orbifold has a hyperbolic structure if its Euler characteristic is {{less than}} 0, a Euclidean structure if it is 0, and if its Euler characteristic is positive it is either bad or has an elliptic structure (an orbifold is called <b>bad</b> <b>if</b> {{it does not have}} a manifold as a covering space). In other words, its universal covering space has a hyperbolic, Euclidean, or spherical structure.|$|E
25|$|Multimodality {{also can}} be used to {{associate}} a text with a specific argumentative purpose, e.g., to state facts, make a definition, cause a value judgment, or make a policy decision. Jeanne Fahnestock and Marie Secor, professors at the University of Maryland and the Pennsylvania State University, labeled the fulfillment of these purposes stases. A text’s stasis can be altered by multimodality, especially when several mediums are juxtaposed to create an individualized experience or meaning. For example, an argument that mainly defines a concept is understood as arguing in the stasis of definition; however, it can also be assigned a stasis of value if the way the definition is delivered equips writers to evaluate a concept, or judge whether something is good or <b>bad.</b> <b>If</b> the text is interactive, the audience is facilitated to create their own meaning from the perspective the multimodal text provides. By emphasizing different stases through the use of different modes, writers are able to further engage their audience in creating comprehension.|$|E
25|$|Applications such as Instagram {{have become}} a “body-image battleground”, while the “selfie” is now the {{universal}} lens in which individuals use to criticise their bodies and others. Facebook and Snapchat also allow users to receive appearance approvals and community acceptance through the ratio of views, comments, and likes. Since individuals who use social media platforms often only display the highpoints of their lives, a survey by Common Sense reported that 22% felt <b>bad</b> <b>if</b> their posts were ignored, or {{if it did not}} receive the amount of attention they hoped for. Hence, this could serve as a trigger for more insecurities, with many utilising digital manipulation techniques as well, to modify their photos {{in order to meet the}} media-crafted ideals of thinness and perfection. According to research by the Renfrew Center Foundation, 50% of men and 70% of 18 to 35 year old women edited their images before uploading. Therefore, 35% of respondents were also actively concerned about being tagged in unattractive photos, while 27% fretted about their appearances online. Yet, with the presence of fake imagery, a majority of individuals still habitually fixate on the lifestyles and belongings of others.|$|E

500|$|The early plank {{roads were}} funded by tolls; these fares were {{collected}} at turnstiles every few {{miles along the}} roads, at rates of $0.02/mile for wagons pulled by two animals (equivalent to $ in [...] ). As time passed, the planks would warp and rot. The tolls were insufficient to fund the maintenance necessary to keep the roads in good repair.

On day three, Plankton plays his harmonica, but becomes exhausted and collapses from running back and forth, since the harmonica is bigger than he is. On the last day of practice, Squidward says if everyone plays loud, they will be good. However, they play poorly, and Squidward changes the plan of playing loud to quiet.

500|$|Before Michigan {{became a}} state, the first land {{transportation}} corridors were the Indian trails. The original Mackinaw Trail ran roughly {{parallel to the}} route of the modern US131 from east of Kalkaska to Petoskey. In the 19th century, the Michigan Legislature chartered private companies to build and operate plank roads or turnpikes in the state. These roads were originally made of oak planks, but later legislation permitted gravel as well. Two thoroughfares in the Grand Rapids area, Division and Plainfield avenues, were originally plank roads. The companies were funded through the collection of tolls. The infrastructure was expensive to maintain, and often the turnpikes fell into disrepair as the wood warped and rotted away. Mark Twain once commented that [...] "the road could not have been <b>bad</b> <b>if</b> some unconscionable scoundrel had not now and then dropped a plank across it," [...] after a trip on the Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids Plank Road. By {{the first decade of the}} 20th century, only 23 of the 202chartered turnpikes were still in operation; many companies that received a charter never built their specified roadways. The remaining plank roads were turned over to the state or purchased by railway companies in the early part of the century.|$|E

500|$|Pneumonia {{has been}} a common disease {{throughout}} human history. The word is from Greek πνεύμων (pneúmōn) meaning [...] "lung". The symptoms were described by Hippocrates (c. 460 BC – 370 BC): [...] "Peripneumonia, and pleuritic affections, are to be thus observed: If the fever be acute, and if there be pains on either side, or in both, and if expiration be if cough be present, and the sputa expectorated be of a blond or livid color, or likewise thin, frothy, and florid, or having any other character different from the common...

[...] However, Hippocrates referred to pneumonia as a disease [...] "named by the ancients". He also reported the results of surgical drainage of empyemas. Maimonides (1135–1204 AD) observed: [...] "The basic symptoms that occur in pneumonia and that are never lacking are as follows: acute fever, sticking pleuritic pain in the side, short rapid breaths, serrated pulse and cough." [...] This clinical description is quite similar to those found in modern textbooks, and it reflected the extent of medical knowledge through the Middle Ages into the 19th century.|$|E

They exited the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup with defeat to German side 1. FC Köln at the quarter-final stage, though after their draw with Lazio in the First Round Kennedy was attacked by some of the Lazio players in an Italian restaurant, and in the ensuing brawl police pulled a gun on teammate Eddie Kelly; Kennedy later said he was targeted by the Lazio players due to his [...] "cheeky face". Back in the league, Kennedy scored his first hat-trick in victory over Nottingham Forest, though Kennedy admitted after the match that [...] "I am still expecting to be dropped any minute". Arsenal overtook Leeds United to win the league title {{on the final day of}} the season, Kennedy scoring the only goal of the game with a late header in a 1–0 victory over North London derby rivals Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. The Sun's Peter Batt wrote that it was [...] "one of the most dramatic goals in the history of the Football League". In the FA Cup, Arsenal progressed past Yeovil Town, Portsmouth (following a replay), Manchester City, Leicester City (following a replay), and Stoke City (following a replay), before meeting Liverpool in the final at Wembley Stadium. Liverpool led early in extra-time, but goals from Kelly and George won the game for Arsenal and secured only the fourth Double in English football. Kennedy had missed a number of good chances throughout the match, though he later pointed out that [...] "nobody really remembers anything <b>bad</b> <b>if</b> you win".|$|E
500|$|It remains disputed to {{this day}} how the Anglo-German {{cooperation}} on Venezuela came about, with varying opinions as {{to the source of}} the initiative. In mid-1901, with the distraction of the Boxer Rebellion gone, Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow decided to respond to the German concerns in Venezuela with some form of military intervention, and discussed with the German navy the feasibility of a blockade. Admiral Otto von Diederichs was keen, and recommended occupying Caracas if a blockade didn't succeed. However, disagreements within the German government over whether a blockade should be pacific (permitting neutral ships to pass) or martial (enabling them to be seized) caused delays, and in any case Kaiser Wilhelm II, German Emperor was unconvinced about the military action. Nonetheless, in late 1901 a renewed demand for reparations was backed up by a show of naval strength, with Vineta and Falke sent to the Venezuelan coast. In January 1902 the Kaiser declared a delay to any blockade due to the outbreak of another civil war in Venezuela (led by financier [...] ) which raised the possibility of a more amenable government. [...] Complicating matters were rumours [...] "rampant in the United States and in England" [...] that Germany wanted Margarita Island as a South American naval base; however a May 1900 visit by the German cruiser SMS Vineta had concluded it was unsuitable, and the German navy had become more conscious of how vulnerable such far-flung bases would be. In late 1901, the British Foreign Office became concerned that Britain would look <b>bad</b> <b>if</b> it failed to defend its citizens' interests while Germany took care of theirs, and began sounding out the Germans about a possible common action, initially receiving a negative response. By early 1902, British and German financiers were working together to pressure their respective governments into action. The Italians, who had begun to suspect the existence of plans to enforce debts, sought to be involved too, but Berlin refused. Their participation was agreed to by the British [...] "after Rome had shrewdly pointed out that it could repay the favor in Somalia".|$|E
