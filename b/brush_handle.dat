Strokes of thick paint, warm in tone, pool up to represent areas of reflected light on the forehead, nose, and cheek. Adjacent to these passages, at the temple, around the furrows of the right eye and the wing of the nostril, are interstices of green-gray underpainting. The right eyeball is painted with a series of transparent glazes, atop which is placed a drop of white lead pigment for the highlight. This eye is surrounded by a complex variety of brushwork: the brow is formed by an uneven series of strokes; a single stroke designates the fold above the upper lid; the skin above the cheek is molded with a rounded brush; the wrinkles at the corner of the eye are denoted by a stroke of wet paint dragged over a dry underpainting. A blunt object, likely a <b>brush</b> <b>handle,</b> was used to accent a wrinkle beneath the eye, and to score into the wet paint of the hair, creating sharp curls against which the broader passages of hair recede.|$|E

50|$|Whole life {{sentences}} {{have also been}} criticised in some quarters for giving offenders no incentive to behave well and co-operate with prison staff, or make any serious attempt at rehabilitation. This was highlighted by the case of Robert Mawdsley, jailed for life for a single murder in 1975, {{who went on to}} kill three inmates several years into his sentence. In 2016, a second such murderer, Victor Castigador, admitted murdering another prisoner. At least two other such prisoners have seriously wounded other inmates in prison. Shortly after being jailed for life in 2005, spree killer Mark Hobson poured a bucket of boiling water over Ian Huntley. In 2012, convicted murderer Gary Vinter admitted slashing Roy Whiting with a sharpened toilet <b>brush</b> <b>handle.</b> Four years later, Vinter admitted the attempted murder of another inmate who was left with a traumatic brain injury and blinded in one eye. Vinter's lawyer claimed after the second attack that the absence of any likelihood of eventual release from prison had left him with no incentive to co-operate with the prison regime.|$|E

One of Daumier's most well-known figurines was entitled The Heavy Burden, and it featured {{a woman and her}} child. The figurine is about 14 inches tall, which is relatively small. The woman looks like she is carrying something, possibly a large bag or large tote. Daumier wanted to portray this woman as a [...] "washerwoman" [...] or laundress. The woman and her child in the figurine also have very detailed faces, but the rest of their bodies and clothes look as if they are messed up, or even blown by the wind. Oliver W.

5000|$|Coldstream was {{committed}} to painting directly from life; he once remarked, [...] "I lose interest unless I let myself be ruled by what I see". His type of realism had its basis in careful measurement, {{carried out by the}} following method: standing before the subject to be painted, a brush is held upright at arm's length. With one eye closed, the artist can, by sliding a thumb up or down the <b>brush</b> <b>handle,</b> take the measure of an object or interval. This finding is compared against other objects or intervals, with the brush still kept at arm's length. Informed by such measurements, the artist can paint what the eye sees without the use of conventional perspective. The surfaces of Coldstream's paintings carry many small horizontal and vertical markings, where he recorded these coordinates so that they could be verified against reality. As a result of his painstaking methods, Coldstream worked slowly, often taking scores of sittings over several months to complete a work. His subjects include still-life, landscapes (usually centered on architecture), portraits, and the female nude.|$|E

Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys' Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine (c.1415–25) and Bouts' Entombment (c.1440–55).

50|$|Its timber {{is highly}} esteemed for door and window panels, joinery and {{furniture}} especially for drawers, wardrobes, cupboards, kitchen and camp furniture, and musical instruments {{because of its}} lightweight, stability and durability.

Gmelina arborea is a popular timber for picture and slate frames, turnery articles and various types of <b>brush</b> backs, <b>brush</b> <b>handles</b> and toys also for handles of chisels, files, saws, screw drivers, sickles etc. The wood is also used for manufacturing tea chests and general purpose plywood, blackboards, frame core and cross bands of flushdoor shutters. In the instrument industry gambhar timber is widely employed for the manufacture of drawing boards, plane tables, instrument boxes, thermometer scales and cheaper grade metric scales. It is also used in artificial limbs, carriages and bobbins. It is an approved timber for handles of tennis rackets, frames and reinforcements of carom boards and packing cases and crates.

40|$|Filled {{thermoplastic}} composites are stiffer, stronger, {{and more}} dimensionally stable than their unfilled counterparts. Such thermoplastics are usually {{provided to the}} end-user as a precompounded, pelletized feedstock. Typical reinforcing fillers are inorganic materials like talc or fiberglass, but materials derived from waste wood, such as wood flour and recycled paper fiber, are also effective as fillers. The goal of this project was to generate commercial interest in using waste-wood–paper-derived fillers (WPFs) to reinforce thermoplastics. The research strategy was twofold: developmental research and outreach. Specific objectives were (1) to improve wastepaper fiber preparation, feeding, and compounding methods, and optimize composite performance, and (2) to communicate to end-product manufacturers the advantages of WPF thermoplastics. The research was led {{and supported by the}} Forest Products Laboratory (FPL), with input from a consortium of 15 fiber suppliers and plastics manufacturers. Additional funding was provided by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Equipment was leased and installed at FPL. Eight general purpose formulations were developed—they included extrusion and injection molding grades of both polyethylene and polypropylene, reinforced with WPFs. An information packet containing performance data, appropriate processing conditions, sample pellets, sample parts, and a questionnaire was sent to nearly 500 commercial plastics manufacturers in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan. In response to requests for in-house trials, FPL researchers conducted nearly 18 site visits. The researchers ensured proper handling of the material, provided consultation, and gathered information about processing and performance. The trials went very well, and parts were successfully manufactured at all facilities. Products included automobile trim components and housings, vacuum cleaner parts, paint <b>brush</b> <b>handles,</b> bicycle parts, cosmetic cases, and other household items. Great interest has been shown in the use of WPF thermoplastics; one consortium member is establishing a 4 million kg/yr (9 million lb/yr) facility.
