40|$|Tubular hollow light guides {{are found}} in many {{lighting}} and daylighting systems to transport collected light into deep spaces of building interiors. Linear straight guides are popularly used due to their high optical efficiency, but non-linear guides with bent sections are sometimes required to fulfill some installation restrictions. The optical performance of such bent guides is, however, unknown. This article presents the development, validation, and application of an optical model to compute the transmittance of light guides with and without bends. The model {{is based on the}} ray-tracing technique and can handle segmented guides with connection elbows. Measurement of the light transmittance of a light guide with two connection elbows is conducted using an outdoor large integrating box to benchmark the model. The model predictions are in good agreement with the measurement and public data for vertical light guides without bends. The model predictions for <b>bent</b> <b>light</b> guides installed in a northern mid-latitude location show that orienting the middle pipe section of the guide toward the northern direction results in better control of sunlight and solar heat gains than other orientations.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of Cantilever Neon Signage has accompanied with the grown-up of Hong Kong urban development after World War II. This enormous steel frame covered with <b>bent</b> neon <b>lights</b> has been erected onto the external wall over {{the streets of}} Hong Kong city {{in the past few}} decades. Its image has been firmly imprinted on every citizen’s memory by its multi-colored and eye-catching gesture. The signal itself embodies part of the social and urban development history of Hong Kong. However, its role in this city has been fading out following with the city’s renewal and advancement in information technology. It is afraid that the Cantilever Neon Signage will end up with a calamitous fate one day as all of them will be eradicated from our city. Throughout this dissertation, we tried to unveil some hidden stories behind this mysterious mask by unravelling the development history and exploring this fading industry in person throughout face-face site visits. The results were astonishing as less people would commit to this handicraft driven industry and it coupled with austere statutory controls which have inevitably halted further potential successors to enter into the industry. published_or_final_versionConservationMasterMaster of Science in Conservatio...|$|R
5000|$|The {{argument}} from illusion seemingly shows {{the need to}} posit sense-data as the immediate objects of perception. In cases of illusion or hallucination, the object has qualities that no public physical object in that situation has and so must be distinct from any such object. Naïve realism may accommodate these facts as they stand {{by virtue of its}} very vagueness (or [...] "open-texture"): it is not specific or detailed enough to be refuted by such cases. A more developed direct realist might respond by showing that various cases of misperception, failed perception, and perceptual relativity do not make it necessary to suppose that sense-data exist. When a stick submerged in water looks bent a direct realist is not compelled to say the stick actually is bent but can say that the stick can have more than one appearance: a straight stick can look <b>bent</b> when <b>light</b> reflected from the stick arrives at one's eye in a crooked pattern, but this appearance is not necessarily a sense-datum in the mind. Similar things can be said about the coin which appears circular from one vantage point and oval-shaped from another. Pressing on your eyeball with a finger creates double vision but assuming the existence of two sense-data is unnecessary: the direct realist can say that they have two eyes, each giving them a different view of the world. Usually the eyes are focused in the same direction; but sometimes they are not.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aerial {{roots of}} Chlorophytum comosum were grown hydroponically, {{allowing}} us to study the performance and mechanism of negative phototropism. The {{results of this study}} were as follows. All the adventitious roots and their branch roots <b>bent</b> away from <b>light</b> with a maximum curvature of approximately 88. 5 °. Blue-violet light prominently induced negative phototropism while red light had no effect. The root cap was the site of photo perception. Roots with shaded or divested root caps exposed to unilateral light showed no negative phototropism, but resumed their original characteristics when the shade was removed or when new root caps grew. The curvature increased when the light intensity ranged 0 – 110 μmol · m− 2 · s− 1. The negative phototropism curvature could be promoted by exogenous CaCl 2 but was inhibited by exogenous LaCl 3; exogenous CaCl 2 could reduce the inhibitory effect of LaCl 3. Unilateral light induced the horizontal transport of IAA from the irradiated side to the shaded side, resulting in an unequal distribution of IAA in both the sides, leading to negative phototropism. The horizontal transport of IAA was promoted by exogenous Ca 2 + but inhibited by exogenous La 3 +...|$|R
40|$|The arching {{technique}} for cut rose cultivation knew {{a great success}} due to a higher yield and {{a better quality of}} the flowering shoots. The success is generally attributed to a higher carbohydrate content supplied to the flowering stem by the bent photosynthesising leaves. However, the photosynthesis rate of shaded (and older) leaves diminishes. As a consequence the undermost bent stems might not contribute to the carbon gain, especially under low natural light intensities. In January, the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was measured above, in the middle of, and under the leaf mass of bent shoots of Rosa hybrida cv. Frisco. The measurements showed an exponential light extinction pattern. The leaf area index (LAI) of the bent shoots, simultaneously registered, varied from 1. 5 - 2 in the middle leaf layer to 4 - 5 under the bent shoots. Photosynthesis rate was measured at different light intensities for leaves of the upper and the lower leaf level of the bent shoots. The saturated photosynthesis rate in the lower bent layer was reduced to ca. 15 % of the CO 2 exchange measured for upper leaves of the bent shoots. The dark respiration rate diminished and the light compensation point increased in leaves of the lower <b>bent</b> layer. In <b>light</b> limited circumstances, the intensity in the lower layer can drop below the light compensation point. Hence, the carbon balance of the lower leaf layer can become negative. Mathematical upscaling of the leaf photosynthesis rate to bent canopy level revealed that the contribution of the lower bent layer to the total carbon gain of the bent shoots was negative. Hence, it might be better to restrict the LAI. Based on our results, an LAI ranging between 1 and 3. 5 is advised for the bent rose shoots in order to optimise the amount of photosynthesising leaves on bent shoots...|$|R
40|$|Monolithic, concrete, square, and {{imposing}} {{are just some}} of the words that could be used to describe the production of Hamlet for which I designed the lighting in my completion of the MFA program at UCSD. In this design, it was my goal to create a world that was grounded in reality and in which ethereal and supernatural elements of the story would feel jarring, out of place, and prophetic. I spent most of my pre-production time examining and studying ways in which natural light enters and fills space. Through my research, I found that light is trimmed by barriers; it slams against walls, is sliced in half by pillars, and is warped by plastics and vapor. Light manages to find its way into even the most obstructed of places. It finds its way through clear glass, cracks in walls, over lips of obstructions, and, by the simple processes of reflection and bounce, illuminates the space. To recreate lighting that behaved the same way in the theatre, I attempted to develop a plot that mirrored elements of natural light. For instance, to light Act 2, I wanted the space to be defined by daylight. I lit the set with golden streaks of light from one direction, while filling the sides of the set in with cooler hues of blue to mirror how shadows appear in reality. This was contrasted by scenes which were lit with silhouette, strong backlight, and often times coupled with a strong spotlight to represent the ghost and the supernatural world. By studying how light behaves in the natural world, the process of replicating and incorporating these behaviors into theatrical environments becomes easier and more intuitive. In turn, once the natural conventions of light are thoroughly understood, the rules can be <b>bent</b> to make <b>light</b> interact in new ways that are shifted dramatically to create a new world for the story...|$|R

6000|$|I must add, however, {{that there}} was a moment when she came near being happy--or, at any rate, {{reflected}} that it was a pity she could not be so. Mrs. Burrage asked her son to play [...] "some little thing," [...] and he sat down to his piano and revealed a talent that might well have gratified that lady's pride. Olive was extremely susceptible to music, and it was impossible to her not to be soothed and beguiled by the young man's charming art. One [...] "little thing" [...] succeeded another; his selections were all very happy. His guests sat scattered in the red firelight, listening, silent, in comfortable attitudes; there was a faint fragrance from the burning logs, which mingled with the perfume of Schubert and Mendelssohn; the covered lamps made a glow here and there, and the cabinets and brackets produced brown shadows, out of which some precious object gleamed--some ivory carving or cinque-cento cup. It was given to Olive, under these circumstances, for half an hour, to surrender herself, to enjoy the music, to admit that Mr. Burrage played with exquisite taste, to feel as if the situation were a kind of truce. Her nerves were calmed, her problems--for the time--subsided. Civilisation, under such an influence, in such a setting, appeared to have done its work; harmony ruled the scene; human life ceased to be a battle. She {{went so far as to}} ask herself why one should have a quarrel with it; the relations of men and women, in that picturesque grouping, had not the air of being internecine. In short, she had an interval of unexpected rest, during which she kept her eyes mainly on Verena, who sat near Mrs. Burrage, letting herself go, evidently, more completely than Olive. To her, too, music was a delight, and her listening face turned itself to different parts of the room, unconsciously, while her eyes vaguely rested on the bibelots that emerged into the firelight. At moments Mrs. Burrage bent her countenance upon her and smiled, at random, kindly; and then Verena smiled back, while her expression seemed to say that, oh yes, she was giving up everything, all principles, all projects. Even before it was time to go, Olive felt that they were both (Verena and she) quite demoralised, and she only summoned energy to take her companion away when she heard Mrs. Burrage propose to her to come and spend a fortnight in New York. Then Olive exclaimed to herself, [...] "Is it a plot? Why in the world can't they let her alone?" [...] and prepared to throw a fold of her mantle, as she had done before, over her young friend. Verena answered, somewhat impetuously, that she should be delighted to visit Mrs. Burrage; then checked her impetuosity, after a glance from Olive, by adding that perhaps this lady wouldn't ask her if she knew what strong ground she took on the emancipation of women. Mrs. Burrage looked at her son and laughed; she said she was perfectly aware of Verena's views, and that it was impossible to be more in sympathy with them than she herself. She took the greatest interest in the emancipation of women; she thought there was so much to be done. These were the only remarks that passed in reference to the great subject; and nothing more was said to Verena, either by Henry Burrage or by his friend Gracie, about her addressing the Harvard students. Verena had told her father that Olive had put her veto upon that, and Tarrant had said to the young men that it seemed as if Miss Chancellor was going to put the thing through in her own way. We know that he thought this way very circuitous; but Miss Chancellor made him feel that she was in earnest, and that idea frightened the resistance out of him--it had such terrible associations. The people he had ever seen who were most in earnest were a committee of gentlemen who had investigated the phenomena of the [...] "materialisation" [...] of spirits, some ten years before, and had <b>bent</b> the fierce <b>light</b> of the scientific method upon him. To Olive it appeared that Mr. Burrage and Mr. Gracie had ceased to be jocular; but that did not make them any less cynical. Henry Burrage said to Verena, as she was going, that he hoped she would think seriously of his mother's invitation; and she replied that she didn't know whether she should have much time in the future to give to people who already approved of her views: she expected to have her hands full with the others, who didn't.|$|R
