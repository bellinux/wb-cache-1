Over these marshes, level as water, but without its glare, and with softer and more soothing gradations of perspective, the eye was carried to a horizon of softly-rounded hills. To your left hand, upon the Old Road, you saw some half-dozen dignified old houses of the colonial time, all comfortably fronting southward. If it were early June, the rows of horse-chestnuts along the fronts of these houses showed, through every crevice of their dark heap of foliage, and on the end of every drooping limb, a cone of pearly flowers, while the hill behind was white or rosy with the crowding blooms of various fruit-trees.

40|$|Controlling <b>black-grass</b> {{in winter}} wheat {{production}} in northern Europe {{is an increasing}} problem because of more frequent winter crops and development of herbicide resistance in weeds. Alternative weed management strategies are needed, e. g., use of more competitive cultivars. Factors that increase cultivar competitiveness include early vigor and straw length, but also allelopathy. Therefore, the allelopathic properties of wheat cultivars included in the Swedish national list or in the release pipeline were investigated using a bioassay with herbicide-resistant and herbicide-sensitive <b>black-grass</b> as receiver plants. Wheat-rye translocation lines were also included in this screening to identify possible sources of high allelopathic activity. The bioassay results were followed up in two-year field trials. The results revealed large variations in allelopathic activity between cultivars. Most cultivars showed interference with both herbicide-sensitive and herbicide-resistant <b>black-grass,</b> although the allelopathic effect was lower on the herbicide-resistant biotype. Cultivars with high allelopathic activity gave only half the <b>black-grass</b> biomass of low allelopathic cultivars. Dinaro, a triticale (wheat-rye hybrid) cultivar and the new wheat cultivar Nimbus showed the highest allelopathy and inhibition of <b>black-grass</b> growth. Only a few wheat lines with rye chromatin, {{all or part of}} a rye chromosome, showed high allelopathy. Use of cultivars with high allelopathic activity can thus be important in integrated weed management of <b>black-grass...</b>|$|E

The aim of the trial was to compare the fitness and resistance value of different <b>black-grass</b> populations under outdoor conditions. Particularly the impact of pre-emergence herbicides was of interest. Different efficiency factors of CADOU SC® (flufenacet) against the tested <b>black-grass</b> populations were observed. The disparities {{in the level of}} control were even greater under the use of STOMP AQUA® (pendimethalin), BOXER® (prosulfocarb) and ARELON TOP® (isoproturon). A hundred percent control of all <b>black-grass</b> populations in both seasons was only achieved by the use of KERB FLO® (propyzamide). It was visible that the <b>black-grass</b> populations that were difficult to control had a powerful constitution, even better than that of those populations {{that turned out to be}} highly susceptible to the herbicide treatments. The fall results in both seasons of the experiment (2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011) were consistent. This was also confirmed for the efficacy results for foliar herbicides in spring. Subject to field history, there was a wide range in sensitivity to the tested herbicides. <b>Black-grass</b> populations from coastal regions were poorly controlled by FOCUS ULTRA® (cycloxydim) or SELECT 240 EC® (clethodim) + PARA SOMMER® (paraffin oil), but were highly susceptible to MOTIVELL® (nicosulfuron). Contrary results were observed with reference to the blackgrass populations from the inland. These populations were derived from fields where the crop rotation contains of 66 % cereals and 33 % maize.

Quantification of fitness cost {{can be used in}} NTSR management strategies to determine the long-term fate of resistant plants in weed populations. To our knowledge, this is the first report evaluating potential fecundity and vegetative fitness of a NTSR <b>black-grass</b> (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds), the most important herbicide resistant weed in Europe, with controlled genetic background. The susceptible (S) and NTSR sub-populations were identified and isolated from a fenoxaprop-P-ethyl resistant population by a plant cloning technique. Using a target-neighborhood design, competitive responses of S and NTSR <b>black-grass</b> sub-populations to increasing density of winter wheat were quantified for 2 years in greenhouse and 1 year in field. Fitness traits including potential seed production, vegetative biomass and tiller number of both sub-populations significantly decreased with increasing density of winter wheat. More importantly, no statistically significant differences were found in fitness traits between S and NTSR sub-populations either grown alone (no competition) or in competition with winter wheat. According to the results, the NTSR <b>black-grass</b> is probably to persist in field even in the cessation of fenoxaprop-P-ethyl. So, effective herbicide resistant management strategies are strongly suggested to prevent and stop the spread of the NTSR <b>black-grass,</b> otherwise NTSR loci conferring resistance to a range of herbicides in <b>black-grass</b> will persist in the gene pool {{even in the absence of}} herbicide application. Consequently, herbicide as an effective tool for control of <b>black-grass</b> will gradually be lost in fields infested by NTSR <b>black-grass...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Black-grass</b> (Alopecurus myosuroides, Huds.) is {{the most}} {{important}} herbicide-resistant weed in Europe. In Germany it is not only a problem in the maritime influenced areas like Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony anymore, as well in other regions <b>black-grass</b> develops to the most important weed in winter wheat and oilseed rape. There are multifaceted reasons for that, one reason are close winter crop rotations and early sowing dates which are economically very attractive for the farmers, another one are herbicide resistances. <b>Black-grass</b> germinates in autumn and in spring, but the main germination period is from late August to early October. If winter wheat is sown early in autumn, the main germination is in parallel to the wheat. Then the weeds can only be managed by culture specific herbicides. The pressure on the herbicides is therefore increasing. Herbicide resistances can be the result. As long as very effective herbicides are available, so that farmers are not dependent on weed biology and plant production weed management measures such as sowing date. Late sowing dates can reduce the <b>black-grass</b> populations, but this option is not attractive to many farmers in Schleswig-Holstein. In mind of the farmers the risk of delayed sowing dates in autumn is too high, because increased rainfall such as can make it difficult to marsh soils sowing, or make impossible.

40|$|The glucosylation of xenobiotics, catalysed by UDP-glucose {{dependent}} O-Glucosyltransferases (OGTs), {{is a major}} {{route of}} pesticide metabolism in wheat {Triticum aestivum L.). OGTs have been characterised in wheat seedlings, their activities toward xenobiotics and natural products defined and their regulation by herbicide safeners studied. Corresponding OGT activities have also been studied in populations of the competing weed <b>black-grass</b> (Alopecurus myosuroides), which differ in their resistance to herbicides. OGT activities were identified in crude extracts from wheat and <b>black-grass.</b> Preferred substrates were 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol and the flavonol quercetin. In wheat, treatment with the herbicide safeners, cloquintocet mexyl and mefenpyr diethyl enhanced OGT activities toward xenobiotic and flavonoid substrates especially in the shoots. The respective OGT activities were determined to be higher in herbicide-resistant populations of <b>black-grass</b> than in the herbicide-susceptible wildtype populations. A 53 kDa OGT active toward 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol and quercetin was purified over 200 -fold from wheat shoots using classical chromatography methods. In addition to 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol the OGT also conjugated 3 -hydroxyflavones. Putative GT cDNA clones were obtained from wheat and <b>black-grass</b> {{using a combination of}} cDNA library screens, 5 ' RACE and RT-PCR. The respective recombinant proteins were expressed as soluble proteins in E. coli but had no activity toward any xenobiotic or flavonoid substrates tested. Finally, the effects of safener treatment (wheat) and herbicide cross-resistance (<b>black-grass)</b> on the concentrations of endogenous glucosylated phenolic metabolites were determined. Conjugates of phenyl propanoids and C-glycosylated flavonoids were identified as major metabohtes in both species. In wheat shoots, herbicide safener treatment resulted in the accumulation of conjugated ferulic acid. Herbicide-resistance in <b>black-grass</b> was associated with the accumulation of conjugated 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid. It was concluded in both wheat and <b>black-grass</b> that changes in xenobiotic conjugation imposed by safeners or acquired resistance to herbicides were mirrored in changes in the accumulation of conjugated natural products.

40|$|Safeners {{enhance the}} {{selectivity}} of graminicidal herbicides such as fenoxaprop ethyl in cereals, by increasing their rates of detoxification in the crop. While studying the selectivity of fenoxaprop ethyl in wheat, we {{determined that the}} safeners mefenpyr diethyl and fenchlorazole ethyl also enhanced herbicide tolerance in the competing weed <b>black-grass</b> (Alopecurus myosuroides). Fenoxaprop ethyl was detoxified by conjugation with glutathione in both wheat and <b>black-grass,</b> with the resulting metabolites processed to the respective cysteine derivatives, which were then N-glycosylated. in <b>black-grass,</b> these detoxification pathways were only slightly enhanced by safeners, suggesting that metabolism alone was unlikely to account for increased herbicide tolerance. instead, {{it was determined that}} safening was associated with an accumulation of glutathione and hydroxymethylglutathione and enzymes with antioxidant functions including phi and lambda glutathione transferases, active as glutathione peroxidases and thiol transferases respectively. These safener-induced changes closely mirrored those determined in two independent <b>black-grass</b> populations that had acquired multiple herbicide resistance (MHR) in the field. In addition to enhanced glutathione metabolism, both safener treatment and MHR resulted in elevated levels of flavonoids in the foliage of <b>black-grass</b> plants, notably flavone-C-glycosides and anthocyanins. Our results demonstrate that safening in a grass weed is associated with an. inducible activation in antioxidant and secondary metabolism which mirrors the biochemical phenotype exhibited in plants that are resistant to multiple classes of herbicides.

The project focussed on <b>black-grass</b> in wheat, but research was also carried out on barley and beans and on wild-oats, barren brome, rye-grass, cleavers and thistles which form stable patches in arable fields. Farmers may also make special efforts to control them. Using cameras mounted on farm machinery, the project explored the feasibility of automating the process of mapping <b>black-grass</b> in fields. Geo-referenced images were captured from June to December 2009, using sprayers, a tractor, combine harvesters and on foot. Cameras were mounted on the sprayer boom, on windows or on top of tractor and combine cabs and images were captured with a range of vibration levels and at speeds up to 20 km h- 1. For acceptability to farmers, it was important that every image containing <b>black-grass</b> was classified as containing black-grass; false negatives are highly undesirable. The software algorithms recorded no false negatives in sample images analysed to date, although some <b>black-grass</b> heads were unclassified and there were also false positives.

40|$|The {{application}} of imazamox as an herbicide in oilseed-rape got possible {{due to the}} introduction of Clearfield oilseed-rape varieties which are tolerant to ALS inhibitors. The question of this investigation was, if the broader use of ALS-inhibitors increases the selection pressure on herbicide resistant weeds and increases their occurrence in the crop rotation. An outdoor container trial with 30 containers (350 l, 0, 7 m²) was performed, starting in autumn 2011. A winter wheat – oilseed-rape rotation was simulated for four years. Three different <b>black-grass</b> biotypes with different resistance pattern and 5 different herbicide programmes were analysed in this study in order to investigate the population dynamics of target-site resistance (TSR) and the development of metabolic resistance. The trials showed interactions between the <b>black-grass</b> biotype and the herbicide strategy on the increase of the <b>black-grass</b> density. There was no interaction due to the use of propyzamide. The frequency of target-site resistance to ACCase inhibitors increased for the corresponding biotypes independently of the herbicide strategy during the trial period. The low frequency of ALS-TSR at trial start did not change during the trial period, independently of the use of imazamox in the oil-seed rape cultivation. The comparison of the resistance factors between the original biotypes and the seeds harvested after the four year container trial showed increasing resistances against pinoxaden for all biotypes. Within the different <b>black-grass</b> biotypes there was a slightly decrease as well as an increase in imazamox efficacy observed. There was no significant increase of meso- + iodosulfuron resistance compared to the original biotypes from 2011 caused by different herbicide treatments.

In comparison, herbicide resistance to VLCFAs inhibitors develops considerably slower. Yet, resistance to the ‘low-risk’ herbicide flufenacet was documented in multi-resistant ryegrass (Lolium spp.) in the northwestern United States.

40|$|Neighboring {{fields in}} three local areas of {{southern}} Germany {{have been investigated}} for the infestation level and herbicide resistance structure of <b>black-grass</b> (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds.). One field within a local area, each with confirmed resistance, served as starting point to survey the surrounding fields. Eighty percent of the fields had very few <b>black-grass</b> ears prior to harvest, with mainly ears from single plants spread over the field. Infestation in the other fields was in large patches or widespread, yet in most situations it did not significantly impact on yield level. Resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides was found on all tested fields in each region. Plants with a target-site mutation to ACCase inhibitors were found in all samples; in addition, most plants also exhibited non-target-site resistance. All five mutations conferring ACCase resistance were found. The diversity of the mutations between areas suggests that resistance evolved independently in most fields. At two locations, each one with confirmed ALS resistance, additional fields with reduced ALS efficacy were detected. At one location only the mutation P 197 T was found, at the second the W 574 L mutation was also found. Target-site resistance {{appears to be the}} major mechanism for these early cases of ALS inhibitor resistance. Understanding the resistance development in individual fields and the spatial dynamics requires investigation over several years. The example of ACCase resistance to <b>black-grass</b> demonstrates how a specific mode of action can be rendered ineffective over a whole region.

Using natural mutants of <b>black-grass,</b> we demonstrated through a molecular, biological, and biochemical approach that residues Trp- 2, 027, Asp- 2, 078, and Gly- 2, 096 are also involved in sensitivity to ACCase inhibitors. In addition, residues Trp- 2, 027 and Asp- 2, 078 are very likely involved in CT activity. Using three-dimensional modeling, {{we found that the}} side chains of the five residues are adjacent, located at the surface of the inside of the cavity of the CT active site, {{in the vicinity of the}} binding site for APPs.

This suggests that the binding sites for these two classes of compounds are overlapping, although distinct. Comparison of three-dimensional models for <b>black-grass</b> wild-type and mutant CTs and for CTs from organisms with contrasted sensitivity to ACCase inhibitors suggested that inhibitors fitting into the cavity of the CT active site of the chloroplastic ACCase from grasses to reach their active sites may be tight.

Using the Pyrosequencing™ technology, leaf material of the different biotypes was screened for ACCase and ALS target-site mutations. The resistance mechanism profiles of the tested biotypes were first completed with metabolism studies of selected herbicides. Finally, the effectiveness of different ACCase and ALS herbicides was investigated in dose response studies under controlled conditions. The results of the analysis showed the occurrence of multiple resistance mechanisms – target-site and non-target site – in the different <b>black-grass</b> biotypes. The calculated resistance factors for the herbicides varied between biotypes and occurring resistance mechanisms. Independent of the range of the resistance factors, low levels already caused decreased effectiveness under real field conditions.

40|$|Herbicide {{resistance}} {{is the result}} of an evolutionary process where a population gradually changes from being susceptible to being resistant to an herbicide. The resistance mechanism is usually a change in the biochemistry of the weed, but in some cases changes in morphology or growth rhythm. The change is caused by random mutations. Two resistance mechanisms are found in black-grass; target site resistance and metabolic resistance. <b>Black-grass</b> is a tufty, winter annual grass weed, which is mainly found in milder climates. <b>Black-grass</b> is a big problem in Southern Europe. In Sweden, it has its main extension in Skåne, Öland and Gotland. Herbicide {{resistance is}} increasing on a global level, especially in farming systems that strongly rely on chemical spraying. Four major factors affecting the build up of resistance are; length of life cycle, spreading, methods of weed control and also the seed bank in the soil. Integrated weed management is required for long-term control of <b>black-grass.</b> A varied chemical spraying should be complemented by other methods, e. g. in crop rotation and tillage methods, increased mechanical methods, clean machines etc. It’s important to alternate between different modes of action, since one reason for increased resistance is that the same herbicide or a few modes of action recurs frequently. There are several methods for testing herbicide resistance. This thesis includes a germination test in petri dishes. Four herbicide from different herbicide groups are tested in seven populations of <b>black-grass,</b> from three different countries. The experiment is a part of a comparative study between laboratories in several Nordic and Baltic countries. The evaluation of the test includes three methods; visual assessment of the coverage, frequency of the number of shoots over 1 cm and a dry matter test. The herbicides are; fenoxaprop-P (in the herbicide Event Super), cycloxydim (Focus Ultra), sulfometuron (Oust) and pendimethalin (Stomp). The result matched with the expected resistance level for some of the populations and herbicides, but not for all. This may be due to experimental mistakes. A repeating of the test would be optimal, to secure more accurate conclusions about the robustness of the test. Through this work I {{have come to the conclusion}} that it’s difficult to find a robust and fast method to detect metabolic resistance. Seed tests to detect target site resistance are often good, but as metabolic resistance usually occurs later in plant development, dose-response-tests in pots are preferred...|$|E
40|$|<b>Black-grass</b> is {{a common}} grass weed, widely spread in Northern Europe and also in Belgium. For ages, {{it has been an}} {{increasing}} problem in industrial crops, especially winter cereals. Therefore, farmers started to spray herbicide intensively and soon cases of failure occurred for different molecules and different modes of action. <b>Black-grass</b> populations have been tested in greenhouses to assess the influence of an herbicide treatment as to the resistance level regarding three different herbicides: chlortoluron, fenoxaprop-P and mesosulfuron+iodosulfuron. <b>Black-grass</b> seeds were collected in field trials in six locations in Belgium, on individuals which have survived the herbicide treatment. Each population comes from trial plots, measuring 2 meters wide by 5 meters long and characterized by a single or a combination of products. Herbicides sprayed were isoproturon, flufenacet+diflufenican, ACCase inhibitors and ALS inhibitors. Seeds were also collected in the untreated plots. The population present in these last ones corresponds to the former population, before the herbicide selection pressure was applied. In the glasshouse assay, this population was used as the standard population to compare with other populations issued from the same field. The 'R' rating system was set up with this population to assess the evolution of resistance level, year in, year out. Rothamsted and Peldon populations were also included as cross-reference. Each field population presented different behaviours towards herbicide applied in greenhouses and some cases of resistance can be highlighted. Generally, a reduction of treatment efficiency between field and greenhouse results was clearly visible for the whole of studied active ingredients. Indeed, a distribution shift of the populations towards higher resistance classes could be observed. This is particularly remarkable for active ingredients sharing the same mode of action. For example, it has been found that populations already sprayed with fenoxaprop-P on the field showed a higher resistance level to fenoxaprop-P than to mesosulfuron in the greenhouse test.

40|$|Herbicide {{resistance}} {{has become}} an increasing problem, {{and at the same}} time pesticide usage is declining due to stringent EU pesticide legislation which aims to reduce the impact on environment and human health. For these reasons, new alternative integrated weed management approaches are becoming increasingly relevant. Formulations based on Brassica defatted seed meals (DSMs) and glycerin, have previously been shown to be effective in reducing the germination of lettuce seed. In this work five DSMs, formulated with and without crude glycerin, were chosen for in vitro and glasshouse experiments: i) Brassica nigra, ii) Brassica tournefortii, iii) Eruca sativa, iv) Rapistrum rugosum and v) Sinapis alba. <b>Black-grass</b> (Alopecurus myosuroides), a weed demonstrating extensive herbicide resistance, was used as a target, and the germination inhibition caused on this weed by Brassica defatted seed meals was assessed. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, the most effective DSM for inhibiting germination of both lettuce and <b>black-grass</b> seeds was the sinigrin containing DSM, Brassica nigra. The aim of the manuscript was to suggest a new high value application for Brassicas derived DSM as a co-products from the vegetable oil production chain. The proposed treatments could represent an interesting and 100...|$|E
40|$|In field {{experiments}} {{the control}} of blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides, Huds.) in oilseed rape using clethodim (Select EC 240) and cycloxydim (Focus Ultra) with and without subsequent treatments with propyzamide (Kerb FLO) was tested at 6 locations in North and South Germany with assumed resistance problems. The field experiments were accompanied using molecular analysis leaf samples from the plots to seize the occurrence of <b>black-grass</b> with the Leu 1781 haplotype and to determine {{the frequency of the}} genotypes. The goal of the trials was to correlate the successes of blackgrass control with the occurrence of hetero- and homozygous resistant genotypes. It was shown in greenhouse trials that clethodim selects the haplotype Leu 1781 more weakly (and it shows a higher partial efficacy) than cycloxydim and that heterozygous plants have a lower resistance factor than homozygous plants. The question raised whether the frequency of heterozygous plants has influence on increased efficacy of clethodim under field conditions. At 5 sites target-site resistance was detected. At one location the high proportion of heterozygous plants correlated positive with relative higher control using Select EC 240 (80 %) compared to Focus Ultra (0 %). At two locations with high proportion of homozygous resistant plants Select EC 240 and Focus Ultra treatments without subsequent treatments with Kerb FLO were not sufficient in solo variants. The subsequent treatments with Kerb FLO provided partly, but not sufficient control of <b>black-grass.</b> At one location no resistance was identified. The effect of Select EC 240 and Focus Ultra to control <b>black-grass</b> were comparable high in all variants with and without subsequent treatments of Kerb FLO. The investigations showed clearly a higher degree of control by plants with the haplotype Leu 1781 by the active substance clethodim and pointed out the fact that the frequency of resistant genotypes (homo vs. heterozygous resistant plants) has a clear influence on the resistance selection. The use of DIMs at locations suspected to be resistant should be assured only with the help of propyzamide and nonchemical measurements (e. g. ploughing, crop rotation). The results also indicate {{that it is necessary to}} assess resistance mechanisms in resistance research individually depending on the active ingredients, inheritance and weed species...|$|E
40|$|Research in {{precision}} spraying {{investigates the}} means {{to reduce the amount}} of herbicide applied by directing droplets more accurately towards the weeds. The trend in the development of spot spraying equipment is an increase of the spatial resolution and new actuators that are able to target very small areas. However, there is a lack of methods for assigning rates of herbicides relating target to optimal droplet features. A wide range of droplet impact angles occurs during the spray application process because of droplet trajectories and the variability of leaf orientation. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted to highlight the effect of surface orientation on droplet impact outcomes (adhesion, rebound or splashing) on two very difficult-to-wet surfaces: an artificial surface with a regular roughness pattern and an excised <b>black-grass</b> leaf with an anisotropic roughness pattern. Measurements were performed for different surface orientations with a high-speed camera coupled with backlighting LED. Droplets of two formulations (distilled water and distilled water + a surfactant) were produced with a moving flat-fan hydraulic nozzle to obtain a wide range of droplet sizes and velocities, which were measured by image analysis. Increasing surface angle reduces surface area available for droplet capture. Droplet impact behaviors are then modified since surface tilt induces a tangential velocity component at impact and, consequently, a reduction of the normal component. Impact modifications have also been observed due to the anisotropic roughness pattern of a <b>black-grass</b> leaf. The integration of droplet-surface interaction information offers a significant way to further improve the precision spraying efficiency by considering the optimal droplet size, speed and ejection angle depending on the target surface and architecture.

40|$|A <b>black-grass</b> (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds.) resistance-monitoring {{conducted}} by BASF in 2010 - 2012 revealed {{a high number}} of accessions with resistance against imazamox. However, application of imazamoxbased products in a winter crop was limited to winter beans in France and United Kingdom only until the introduction of the Clearfield®-production system in autumn 2012 in winter oilseed rape. It is therefore assumed that the resistance mechanisms were probably selected by the frequent use of ACCase- and ALSinhibitors in winter crop rotations during the last 2 decades. Resistance level for each product-biotype combination was calculated according the “R”-classification system (S, R?, RR, RRR) by directly comparing the product performance on a biotype versus untreated control. Majority of resistant biotypes did not show a target-site mutation at the known codon Pro 197 or Trp 574. In order to better evaluate the impact of Non-Target-Site-Resistance (NTSR) on the activity of BEYOND (imazamox), ATLANTIS WG (mesosulfuron+iodosulfuron) and ABAK (pyroxsulam), biotypes who have shown an ALS-target-site mutation were removed from further analysis. At the dose rate of 35 g ai/ha BEYOND provided good activity on susceptible biotypes of <b>black-grass</b> almost matching up with ATLANTIS WG and ABAK. However, activity of BEYOND declined stronger on biotypes classified as R? or RR for that product, while ATLANTIS WG and ABAK hardly showed any decline in control on this group of biotypes when applied at the recommended dose rate. It is assumed that the underlying NTSR-mechanism is not effective enough yet to confer resistance to ATLANTIS WG and ABAK, but on BEYOND. In contrast, biotypes classified as R? for ATLANTIS WG did show a stronger impact on the activity of BEYOND and ABAK then of ATLANTIS WG. These differences in control level probably do translate into differences in selection pressure as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of herbicide resistance {{is an important}} topic in plant protection and agricultural practice. Safeners are commonly used in herbicides to protect crops against herbicidal damage. Although {{no effect on the}} weed control is expected, it has been theorized that the rate of {{evolution of}} non-target site resistance (NTSR) in weeds in cereals may be enhanced by use of herbicide products containing safeners. One of the most important safeners in cereals is mefenpyr-diethyl. Therefore, the possible influence of mefenpyr on herbicide resistance was studied in cooperative trials between Bayer CropScience (BCS, F-Höchst) and FH Bingen. The trials tested in parallel different herbicide resistant <b>black-grass</b> (Alopecurus myosuroides (Huds.)) biotypes under greenhouse conditions. The biotypes where chosen due to known NTSR against Atlantis WG® (4 highly resistant and 5 moderately resistant) as well as two susceptible biotypes. The populations were treated with the following three herbicide/safener regimes in six concentrations adjusted according to the anticipated biotype resistance levels. (1) mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron + without safener formulation, (2) mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron + constant mefenpyr concentration (45 g/ha), (3) mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron + varying mefenpyr concentrations (ratio 5 : 1 : 15). The treatments were applied in post-emergence based on mesosulfuron to iodosulfuron ratios in Atlantis WG® (5 : 1). The trials were assessed visually (% effect) and by fresh weight. Dose-response curves were performed and ED 50 values for each treatment and biotype were calculated. Results showed a varying effect of safeners which was in the most cases negligible. Depending on the biotypes mostly no impact on the safener was found for herbicide resistance. In conclusion, the trials from Bingen and F-Höchst gave evidence, that there is no significant and consistent influence of the safener mefenpyr on evolution of NTSR <b>black-grass...</b>|$|E
40|$|Pleiotropic effects {{associated}} with genes endowing resistance to herbicides are generally predicted to reduce plant fitness. Quantifying these effects {{is necessary to}} develop management strategies against herbicide-resistant weeds. We assessed the pleiotropic effects {{associated with}} three mutant alleles of the herbicide target enzyme acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) on plant growth and seed production in <b>black-grass</b> Alopecurus myosuroides. In each of two field experiments, <b>black-grass</b> populations segregating for Leu- 1781 (five populations), Asn- 2041 (three populations) or Gly- 2078 (two populations) ACCase were produced to obtain several distinct, homogenized genetic backgrounds and to permit reliable comparisons among wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous mutant ACCase plants grown in competition with a wheat crop. No significant differences from wild-type plants in vegetative biomass, height and seed production were observed in Leu- 1781 or Asn- 2041 ACCase plants. Over both experiments, homozygous Gly- 2078 ACCase plants displayed {{a significant reduction in}} biomass (42 %), height (6 %) and seed production (36 %). Reduction varied with the segregating population and between field experiments. Synthesis and applications. Our work illustrates the variation in fitness cost depending on the resistance gene, the plant genetic background and the environment. This underlines the necessity to identify the resistance gene(s) present in a weed population before designing resistance-management strategies. Competitive crops should be effective against Gly- 2078 ACCase plants. The effect of resistant ACCase alleles on seed survival and germination needs to be studied in order to develop cultural practices creating or maximizing fitness costs in resistant plants. However, the variation of fitness cost with the environment and the weed population, as well as the likely absence of fitness cost associated with resistance genes such as Leu- 1781 ACCase, renders the success of specific cultural control practices uncertain. A solution could be a weed control programme maximizing the diversity of cultural practices and including anti-resistance cultural practices to avoid or reduce selection for resistant ACCase alleles...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the {{mechanisms}} of herbicide resistance is important for designing long term sustainable weed management strategies. Here, we have used an integrated biology and molecular approach to investigate {{the mechanisms}} of resistance to acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibiting herbicides in a UK <b>black-grass</b> population (BG 2). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Comparison between BG 2 phenotypes using single discriminant rates of herbicides and genotypes based on ACCase gene sequencing showed that the I 1781 L, a novel I 1781 T, but not the W 2027 C mutations, were associated with resistance to cycloxydim. All plants were killed with clethodim and a few individuals containing the I 1781 L mutation were partially resistant to tepraloxydim. Whole plant dose response assays demonstrated that a single copy of the mutant T 1781 allele conferred fourfold resistance levels to cycloxydim and clodinafop-propargyl. In contrast, {{the impact of the}} I 1781 T mutation was low (Rf = 1. 6) and non-significant on pinoxaden. BG 2 was also characterised by high levels of resistance, very likely non-target site based, to the two cereal selective herbicides clodinafop-propargyl and pinoxaden and not to the poorly metabolisable cyclohexanedione herbicides. Analysis of 480 plants from 40 cycloxydim resistant black grass populations from the UK using two very effective and high throughput dCAPS assays established for detecting any amino acid changes at the 1781 ACCase codon and for positively identifying the threonine residue, showed that the occurrence of the T 1781 is extremely rare compared to the L 1781 allele. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study revealed a novel mutation at ACCase codon position 1781 and adequately assessed target site and non-target site mechanisms in conferring resistance to several ACCase herbicides in a <b>black-grass</b> population. It highlights that over time the level of suspected non-target site resistance to some cereal selective ACCase herbicides have in some instances surpassed that of target site resistance, including the one endowed by the most commonly encountered I 1781 L mutation...|$|E
40|$|Carboxyesterases which {{activate}} aryloxyphenoxypropionate (AOPP) graminicides {{to their}} bioactive herbicidal acids by hydrolysing the respective ester precursors {{have been identified}} in <b>black-grass</b> (Alopecurus myosuroides), a problem weed of cereal crops in Northern Europe. The dominant 40 kDa carboxyesterase was purified 1700 -fold and identified as a serine hydrolase by affinity labelling with a biotinylated fluorophosphonate suicide substrate. MS–MS sequencing of a peptide digest identified it {{to be a member of}} the GDSL family of serine hydrolases. The full-length A. myosuroides hydrolase (Amgdsh 1) was cloned by RACE-PCR and expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris as a secreted enzyme.

40|$|Herbicide {{resistant}} grass-weeds {{continue to}} pose a considerable threat to the sustainability of arable farming in the UK. Resistant <b>black-grass</b> is the major problem but rye-grass, {{and to a lesser}} degree wild-oats, are also causing increasing concern. Herbicide-resistant chickweed and poppy are new threats. A major issue is the loss of herbicides {{as a consequence of the}} ongoing EC review of pesticides. This is likely to result in increased dependence on newer, but higher resistance risk herbicides, such as the ‘fops ’ and ‘dims ’ (ACCase inhibitors) and sulfonylureas (ALS inhibitors). The introduction of ‘Atlantis’, a mixture of two sulfonylureas, has given many farmers a respite from resistance, but this benefit may be short-term.
