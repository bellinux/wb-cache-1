Nowadays, the in vitro gliding assay is being considered a model system to experimentally investigate various aspects of group behavior and pattern formation by self-propelled objects. In the in vitro gliding assay, cytoskeletal filaments F-actin or microtubules are driven by the surface immobilized associated biomolecular motors myosin or dynein respectively. Although the F-actin/myosin or microtubule/dynein system was found to be promising in understanding the collective motion and pattern formation by self-propelled objects, the most widely used <b>biomolecular</b> <b>motor</b> system microtubule/kinesin could not be successfully employed so far in this regard. Failure in exhibiting collective motion by kinesin driven microtubules is attributed to the intrinsic properties of kinesin, which was speculated to affect the behavior of individual gliding microtubules and mutual interactions among them.

Despite these achievements, further progress of the field and translation of the reported applications to a real-world setting require overcoming several key challenges, such as, development of effective cargo conjugation strategies and precise control of the transport directionality with the reconstituted <b>biomolecular</b> <b>motor</b> systems. The challenge of cargo conjugation is addressed in this thesis through the development of a robust bioorthogonal strategy to functionalize microtubules. The versatility of the developed method is demonstrated by covalently conjugating various types of cargos to microtubules. Further, the effect of the linker length on cargo attachment to microtubules is investigated by attaching cargo to microtubules via linkers of different lengths. By using kinesin-driven transport of microtubules that are covalently conjugated to antibodies, detection of various clinically relevant analytes is demonstrated as proof-of-principle applications for biosensing. Finally, the challenge of gaining control over transport directionality is addressed through topographical guiding of microtubules in nanostructures, and optimization of assay parameters to achieve successful guiding of microtubules.

40|$|Molecular motors are protein {{structures}} that {{play a central}} role in accomplishing mechanical work inside a cell. While chemical reactions fuel this work, it is not exactly known how this chemical-mechanical conversion occurs. Recent advances in microbiological techniques have enabled at least indirect observations of molecular motors which in turn have led to significant effort in the mathematical modeling of these motors in the hope of shedding light on the underlying mechanisms involved in intracellular transport. Kinesin which moves along microtubules that are spread throughout the cell is a prime example of the type of motors that are studied in this work. The motion is linked to the presence of a chemical, ATP, but how the ATP is involved in motion is not clearly understood. One commonly used model for the dynamics of Kinesin in the biophysics literature is the Brownian ratchet mechanism. In this work, we give a precise mathematical formulation of a Brownian ratchet (or more generally a diffusion ratchet) via an infinite system of stochastic differential equations with reflection. This formulation is seen to arise in the weak limit of a natural discrete space model that is often used to describe motor dynamics in the literature.

30|$|Herein, {{we propose}} {{a concept that}} {{is the use of}} a <b>biomolecular</b> <b>motor</b> protein of F 1 -ATPase as a nano-flow-sensor to measure the flow {{velocity}} in the proximity of a solid surface. In fact, F 1 -ATPase functions as a rotary molecular motor in a living body; the central γ-subunit rotates anticlockwise against α 3 β 3 -subunits by hydrolysis of ATP [15]. Because the size of F 1 -ATPase is about 10 nm, much less than the detection limit of an optical microscope, its rotation has been observed by coupling the γ-subunit to a nanometer-sized tag-bead that enhances the rotational motion. Our idea is that, if a flow near a surface exerts a hydrodynamic force on the F 1 -ATPase and the tag-bead complex (F 1 -bead) that is immobilized on a considered surface, the rotational motion will be affected and correlated with the near-surface flow. Therefore, the near-surface velocity can be evaluated directly if the rotation of F 1 -bead is measured. Using a biomolecule as kind a nano-machine might sound impractical idea, because biomolecule is usually unstable, irreproducible, etc. Realizing practical artificial nano-machine (nano-flow-sensor in this case) is a different issue and is technological improvements on the immediate horizon. Using forthcoming F 1 -ATPase is only the way to utilize nano-machine for near-surface flow measurements at present, and we believe that the obtained knowledge will be profitable for the future development of such a nano-machine and the related applications in nanotechnology.|$|E
