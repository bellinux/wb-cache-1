In addition to the aircraft, numerous spares were sent, including engines and ancillary equipment such as cameras and seaplane <b>beaching</b> <b>gear,</b> along with 300 support vehicles consisting of motor transports, trailers and motorcycles. The value of the Imperial Gift was about $5 million, {{more money than the}} Canadian government spent on aviation from 1919 to 1923.|$|E
5|$|Delivered to the Navy on January 30, 1937, the {{aircraft}} was officially {{presented to the}} public at Hall's Bristol, Pennsylvania factory in April of that year. The aircraft's early flight testing, starting in February and conducted by test pilot Bill McAvoy, showed that the XPTBH had few faults, with the only significant issue being a lack of roll authority – a reduction of the ability of the ailerons to turn {{the aircraft}} – {{as a result of the}} surface area of the floats. A modification to increase the area of the rudder solved the issue. The aircraft's water-handling characteristics were found to be excellent; the only significant complaints that surfaced during the testing period concerned the XPTBH-2's <b>beaching</b> <b>gear,</b> which was found to be extremely difficult to use in anything other than the calmest water.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, the United States Navy placed orders {{with both}} Douglas and Consolidated Aircraft for single prototypes of patrol flying boats, {{to replace the}} Consolidated P2Y and Martin P3M that {{equipped}} the Navy's patrol squadrons. Douglas's design, the P3D, was designed in parallel with the smaller YB-11 being developed for the United States Army Air Corps (which was eventually built as the YOA-5), and like the YB-11, was a twin-engined high-winged monoplane with its engines (the new Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp radial engine mounted in nacelles above and ahead of the wing. Unlike the YB-11, it was a pure flying boat rather than an amphibian, and was therefore fitted with retractable <b>beaching</b> <b>gear</b> {{to allow it to}} be moved to and from shore, rather than a full undercarriage allowing operation from land or sea.|$|E

25|$|Stranded vessels can be {{retracted}} from a {{beach or}} reef {{by the use}} of Grasp's towing machine and propulsion. Additional retraction force can be applied to a stranded vessel through the use of up to six legs of <b>beach</b> <b>gear,</b> consisting of 6,000 pound STATO anchors, wire rope, chain, and salvage buoys. In a typical configuration, two legs of <b>beach</b> <b>gear</b> are rigged on board Grasp, and up to four legs of beach are rigged to the stranded vessel.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the standard legs of <b>beach</b> <b>gear,</b> Grasp carries 4 spring buoys. The spring buoys are carried beneath the port and starboard bridge wings. Each spring buoy weighs approximately 3100 pounds, is [...] long and [...] in diameter, provides a net buoyancy of 7½ tons, and can withstand 125 tons of pull-through force. The spring buoys are used with <b>beach</b> <b>gear</b> legs rigged from a stranded vessel when deep water is found seaward of the stranded vessel.|$|R

5000|$|... 10-19 July 1943: VP-45 {{made its}} ﬁrst bombing run on Paramushir, Kurile Islands. The bombs were {{released}} by radar {{at night in}} overcast with unknown results. This performance was repeated on 19 July 1943. *10 August - 9 October 1943: VP-45 personnel were able to move ashore at Attu. Duties consisted primarily of sector searches for enemy activity, which by this time had been largely eliminated. Casco Cove at Attu {{was too small to}} provide adequate protection for the entire squadron and facilities for use of <b>beaching</b> <b>gear</b> for the non-amphibious PBY-5s was nonexistent. On 9 October 1943, the squadron was relieved by VP-43 for return to NAS Seattle, where the squadron could be reﬁtted with new PBY-5A amphibious aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Dane Reynolds started Summer Teeth {{with his}} manager Blair Marlin. It was {{started as a}} kitschy <b>beach</b> <b>gear</b> brand, they now produce t-shirts and other apparel.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the standard legs of <b>beach</b> <b>gear,</b> Salvor carries 4 spring buoys. The spring buoys are carried beneath the port and starboard bridge wings and are painted bright orange.

50|$|In {{addition}} to her two main ground tackle anchors Navy standard stockless or 8000 lb Safeguard can use equipment associated with her <b>beach</b> <b>gear</b> to lay a multi-point open water moor to station herself for diving and ROV operations.|$|R
50|$|Some non-amphibious {{seaplanes}} may {{be mistaken}} for amphibians (such as the Shin Meiwa PS-1) which carry their own <b>beaching</b> <b>gear</b> - usually this is a wheeled dolly or temporary set of wheels used to move a flying boat or floatplane from the water {{and allow it to}} be moved around on land but can also appear as a conventional undercarriage. These are not built to take the impact of the aircraft landing on them. An amphibian can leave the water without anyone getting in the water to attach beaching wheels (or even having to have any handy), yet a fully functional undercarriage is heavy and impacts the aircraft's performance, and isn't required in all cases, so an aircraft may be designed to carry its own.|$|E

50|$|The PSN-2 was a glider {{floatplane}} {{designed to}} test the concept and guidance equipment {{for a range of}} guided glider bombs proposed by S.F. Valk in 1933. Constructed of wood, the PSN-2 was a sleek monoplane aircraft with two floats attached to the wing with struts, an open cockpit in the extreme nose of the fuselage and extra fins at the aft end of each float. The PSN-2 could be carried aloft under a mother-ship or aero-towed off water. <b>Beaching</b> <b>gear</b> was available for manoeuvring the aircraft when not on the water. The planned mission of the pilotless production version of PSN-2 included a 40 km(25.85 mile) range flown at 700 km/h(435 mph), guided to the target with the KVANT Infra-red guidance system. Flight testing was carried out in 1940, but work was discontinued on 19 July 1940.|$|E
50|$|When {{the weather}} moderated, Windlass and Salvager {{returned}} {{to the scene of}} the dual grounding. The former pulled off stranded Seneca, and the latter pulled Basilone free. Windlass remained in the vicinity to pick up <b>beach</b> <b>gear</b> anchors and wires strewn over the bottom, recovering a total of 14 anchors.|$|R
5000|$|With the new year, 1948, Salvager {{continued}} her work of removing dangers to navigation; and, in August, she began salvage {{tests on the}} [...] off Piney Point, MD. She tested techniques of salvage and towing on the U-boat into November, then stripped the test boat of all experimental equipment; sank her temporarily off Point No Point Light; and planted buoys to mark the spot. Then, {{with the addition of}} two sets of <b>beach</b> <b>gear,</b> she resumed normal salvage work, again operating primarily with Windlass.|$|R
50|$|It {{is a small}} <b>beach,</b> mainly <b>geared</b> towards water sports. Facilities {{exist for}} renting diving material, canoes and jetski's. There are boat rides to visit the island of Klein Curaçao. Baya Beach is also known for its night life.|$|R

50|$|Aircraft {{with lower}} hull damage were patched or had the holes filled with any {{materials}} to hand before landing. The aircraft {{would then be}} immediately put onto a slipway with its wheeled <b>beaching</b> <b>gear</b> or beached on a sandy shore before it could sink. More than two fuselage compartments had {{to be full of}} water to sink the aircraft. During the Second World War, a number of severely damaged aircraft were deliberately landed on grass airfields ashore. In at least one case, an aircraft that made a grass landing was repaired to fly again. On the Sunderland Mk V, fuel could be dumped from retractable pipes that extended from the hull and were attached to the bomb room side of the galley aft bulkhead. It was expected that dumping would be done while airborne, but it could also be performed while floating on the water, albeit with care to ensure that the floating fuel went downwind away from the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Portable <b>beaching</b> <b>gear</b> {{could be}} {{attached}} by ground crew {{so that the}} aircraft could be pulled up on land. The gear consisted {{of a pair of}} two-wheeled struts that could be attached to either side of the fuselage, below the wing, with a two- or four-wheel trolley and towbar attached under the rear of the hull. A standard stocked anchor was stowed in the forward compartment alongside the anchor winch. Depending on the operating area, a number of different kinds of anchor could be carried to cope with different anchorages. Another means of direction control on the water was by application of the rudder and aileron flight controls. The ailerons would cause asymmetric lift from the airflow and, ultimately, drop a float into the water to cause drag on that wing. The pilots could vary engine power to control the direction and speed of the aircraft on the water. In adverse combinations of tide, wind, and destination, this could be very difficult.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the pier}} {{on the inner}} beach, the bathhouse is on the outer beach. Originally built in 1932, the bathhouse was {{declared}} a historic landmark in 1989 as {{it was one of}} the last bathhouses built in Southern California. [...] In the Twentieth century, the bathhouse was a place for people to rent <b>beach</b> <b>gear,</b> such as towels and swimsuits, and boats. Overall, the bathhouse offered activities for people to enjoy the inner beach of Cabrillo. [...] The 26,000 square foot building was restored on October 12, 2002, and kept its Mediterranean-style structure. [...] Today, the bathhouse has shower rooms, restrooms, life guard facilities, a snack bar, and a community meeting room upstairs.|$|R
50|$|Capable {{of lifting}} 25 tons with an A-frame derrick mounted forward {{and capable of}} a 100-ton ballast bow lift: an {{exceptional}} salvage platform with air compressors for diving operations and salvage tools. A Clyde salvage winch and a capstan, each with 7.5-ton pulling capacity, provided the muscle needed for the A-frame, the three complete sets of <b>beach</b> <b>gear</b> carried on board (60-ton pull on each leg), and the flexible power needed on independent operations. Two jetting pumps provided dewatering, underwater digging, and auxiliary fire fighting capabilities. Cutting/welding and messing/berthing facilities were also aboard. Two AC generators also provided electrical power to the salvage site and shore power to distressed ships/bases as required. Manned by an Officer in Charge and 16 enlisted men, they often operated independently and were a vital asset to a major salvage job.|$|R
2500|$|When it {{was seen}} from the shore that the steamer was in distress, word was passed to the Yaquina Bay {{life-saving}} station, which was about [...] away and [...] out. The keeper of the life-saving station, Captain Otto Wellander, and his crew responded overland, securing two teams of horses to pull the carts containing their <b>beach</b> rescue <b>gear</b> and the station’s surfboat south down the beach and on the narrow wagon road around Seal Rocks, arriving at the wreck scene about 3 hours after having received word.|$|R
50|$|Crew {{size was}} about 120 men {{including}} the complement of divers, made complete with some unique features found onboard. Two fire monitors, capable of pumping out 4000 {{gallons of water}} per minute onto a flaming deck, aided in rescue efforts. A full machine shop allowed patches to be cut and assembled, repairing damaged hulls long enough to return to port for any major repairs. The forward boom could lift up to 20 tons while the one aft, on the fantail, had a maximum lift of 8 tons. Also on the fantail was the Almon Johnson Towing machine which held 2100 feet of 2 inch wire rope capable of a maximum pull of 50 tons.Further, in her salvage holds was an extensive inventory of portable salvage equipment- pumps, generators, and welding machines of various sizes that could be placed wherever needed. Plus, eight complete legs of <b>beach</b> <b>gear,</b> each capable of generating up to 60 tons of pulling power, were maintained onboard. The ships could lift up to 150 tons off {{the bottom of the}} ocean with its main bow rollers and an additional 30 tons on its auxiliary bow rollers. A recompression chamber was available for treating diving related sicknesses and the MK-5 Surface Supplied Diving System was in use.|$|R

40|$|The {{preliminary}} {{results of a}} study on the beach seine fishery is given, including a brief analysis of the reported landings and their respective landing values. Landing statisticas are reported for the 8 most important species or group of species in the northern, central and southern regions. The artisanal fleet and <b>beach</b> seine <b>gear</b> characteristics are also given. Length frequency distributions are reported for the catches of horse mackerel, sardine, squid and Spanish mackerel as well as the composition of catches at Costa de Caparica.

5000|$|Catch the Ball: The {{players were}} sent to an old, {{abandoned}} jail, early in the evening, for their next assignment. A large steel ball was {{held in place by}} electromagnets, which were in turn powered by three batteries. The batteries could fail at any moment - perhaps five minutes after the assignment began, perhaps five hours, perhaps even longer than that. If whoever was standing under the ball caught it when it fell, theyd double their winnings from the waterfall assignment, but if they let the ball fall, theyd lose those winnings. It was at this point revealed what the other bags from the waterfall assignment would get them. With one choice of the essentials, Petrina chose food over cooking gear,sleeping bags, and pillows. They got two bags labeled luxury items, and Alison chose alcohol and plush bedding over fancy food and chocolate. Lastly was the choice of accessories, as they got two bags with that label. Kris chose snack food and entertainment (a guitar and some board games) over <b>beach</b> <b>gear</b> and common household items, as these choices were meant to be items that would be useless for a night in a jail. Nikki was then only allowed to take $10,000 of the $20,000 [...] "Mole Bucks" [...] in another cell. Cam and Nathan took most of the turns standing under the ball, with Shaun and the women each refusing to take more than a small number of early ones and sleeping {{through the rest of the}} assignment. The host returned to the players midway through the night and offered to call the assignment off, meaning theyd not risk losing their winnings from the waterfall, but the players chose to press on. The ball fell early the next morning, with Cam standing below it. He failed to catch it and the $10,000 was lost.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{construct}} {{a checklist of}} species present and to attempt correlations between distribution and abundance of the organisms and environ-mental factors. To establish a reference collection at the Field Laboratory. Procedures: Collections were made {{from all parts of}} the Galveston Bay-system and the adjacent Gulf of Mexico <b>beach.</b> Collection <b>gear</b> consisted of a fine-mesh dredge and any other equipment that prevailing conditions required, such as plain old-fashioned beachcombing. Invertebrates taken in any other study were saved as part of this job. A cabinet was constructed in the Field Laboratory to house a study and reference collection of local organisms and a catalog of species contained in the collection is in preparation. Findings: Checklist of Species Identified A subjective estimate was made of the abundance of each organism, and of the salinity in which each most commonly occurred. These designations are modified slightly from those used by Andrews in his 1956 checklist of Chesapeake Bay mollusks, and are as follows...|$|R
25|$|While gillweed nets are a {{principal}} concern, {{other types of}} nets also pose a problem: trawl nets, purse seines, <b>beach</b> seines, longline <b>gear,</b> and driftnets. Driftnets are known for high rates of bycatch and they affect all cetaceans and other marine species. They are fatal for small toothed whales (Odontocetes) and sperm whales, {{as well as other}} marine mammals and fish such as sharks, sea birds and sea turtles. Many fisheries routinely use driftnets exceeding the EU size limit of 2.5km/boat. This illegal drift-netting is a major issue, especially in important feeding and breeding grounds for cetaceans.|$|R
