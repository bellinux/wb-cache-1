It is known in English as Japanese snake gourd.|$|R
50|$|Herodotus gave a mythological {{account of}} Cyrus's early life. In this account, Astyages had two prophetic dreams {{in which a}} flood, and then a series of fruit <b>bearing</b> <b>vines,</b> emerged from his {{daughter}} Mandane's pelvis, and covered the entire kingdom. These were interpreted by his advisers as a foretelling that his grandson would one day rebel and supplant him as king. Astyages summoned Mandane, at the time pregnant with Cyrus, back to Ecbatana to have the child killed. Harpagus delegated the task to Mithradates, one of the shepherds of Astyages, who raised the child and passed off his stillborn son to Harpagus as the dead infant Cyrus. Cyrus lived in secrecy, but {{when he reached the}} age of 10, during a childhood game, he had the son of a nobleman beaten when he refused to obey Cyrus's commands. As it was unheard of for the son of a shepherd to commit such an act, Astyages had the boy brought to his court, and interviewed him and his adopted father. Upon the shepherd's confession, Astyages sent Cyrus back to Persia to live with his biological parents. However, Astyages summoned the son of Harpagus, and in retribution, chopped him to pieces, roasted some portions while boiling others, and tricked his adviser into eating his child during a large banquet. Following the meal, Astyages' servants brought Harpagus the head, hands and feet of his son on platters, so he could realize his inadvertent cannibalism. In another version, Cyrus was presented as the son of a poor family that worked in the Median court.|$|R
5000|$|Critic Jennifer Waller {{describes}} the accompanying illustration adding {{meaning to the}} poem, saying [...] "a twining <b>vine</b> <b>bearing</b> flamboyant flowers, suggesting passion and sexuality; the lower leaves of the plant are angular and strained and suggest a hint of impending experience." [...] Thus, for Waller [...] "origins of the scene" [...] lie in [...] "the simplicity of domestic love through the expressions of frank sexuality".|$|R
25|$|The {{plant is}} a {{herbaceous}} perennial <b>vine,</b> <b>bearing</b> alternate heart-shaped or palmately lobed leaves and medium-sized sympetalous flowers. The edible tuberous root {{is long and}} tapered, with a smooth skin whose color ranges between yellow, orange, red, brown, purple, and beige. Its flesh ranges from beige through white, red, pink, violet, yellow, orange, and purple. Sweet potato cultivars with white or pale yellow flesh are less sweet and moist than those with red, pink or orange flesh.|$|R
40|$|Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon are Vitis vinifera scion {{varieties}} that {{are susceptible to}} Pierce’s disease (PD). We evaluated the effect of rootstock variety on PD symptom expression in these varieties grown in a vineyard with high natural PD pressure and abundant vectors. No rootstock completely eliminates PD symptoms in the susceptible scions. However, rootstocks differ {{in the level of}} PD symptoms in the susceptible scions grafted to them and the percentage of <b>vines</b> <b>bearing</b> fruit varies with rootstock variety. Rootstocks appear to contribute to PD management in susceptible scion varieties, but are not independently capable of rescuing susceptible scions. Evaluation of PD management practices should emphasize vineyard testing to encourage the efficient identification and development of field suitable techniques and methods...|$|R
50|$|The grape vine {{laden with}} purple grapes and the {{fishermen}} with their net were {{selected based on}} their role as {{the products of the}} island, as well as the symbolic meaning from scripture. The window depicts the scene of Christ's call to the fishermen, showing Him seated beneath a gnarled grape <b>vine</b> <b>bearing</b> fruit near the sea, earnestly conversing with Peter and Andrew, who with their net are sitting in front of Jesus with characteristically eager faces, displaying the impetuosity of the former and the sincerity of the latter as they yield to the Lord's call in the spirit of worldly renunciation. The face of Christ is strikingly beautiful in its ardent earnestness and yearning desire for the partnership with those two fishermen.|$|R
60|$|As a {{small crowd}} had collected, and as the joke was {{drifting}} rather too far in the cabman's direction, we climbed in without further parley, and were driven away amid cheers. We stopped the cab at a boot shop a little past Astley's Theatre that looked {{the sort of place}} we wanted. It was one of those overfed shops that the moment their shutters are taken down in the morning disgorge their goods all round them. Boxes of boots stood piled on the pavement or in the gutter opposite. Boots hung in festoons about its doors and windows. Its sun-blind was as some grimy <b>vine,</b> <b>bearing</b> bunches of black and brown boots. Inside, the shop was a bower of boots. The man, when we entered, was busy with a chisel and hammer opening a new crate full of boots.|$|R
5000|$|Nepenthes mikei was {{formally}} described by Bruce Salmon and Ricky Maulder in a 1995 {{issue of the}} Carnivorous Plant Newsletter. The herbarium specimen B.Salmon & R.Maulder 221719 is the designated holotype, and is deposited at the Auckland Institute and Museum (AK) in Auckland, New Zealand. It was prepared on February 17, 1995, from a plant cultivated in New Zealand, and consists of a <b>vine</b> <b>bearing</b> a female inflorescence, a lower pitcher, and a rosette. The specimen was originally collected in 1989 from a [...] "very steep ridge in wet mossy forest" [...] near the summit of Mount Pangulubao, {{at an altitude of}} 2000 m. The authors described the plant as growing [...] "in peaty humus or moss at the base of 5-6 m tall trees". Salmon and Maulder also pressed a second specimen of N. mikei from material collected at the same elevation on Pangulubao. Additional herbarium specimens of N. mikei are known and these show slight morphological variability.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{the most}} {{remarkable}} aspect of the Butrint baptistery is its mosaic pavement. Most likely created by mosaicists from Nicopolis, the mosaic floor is considered the most complex of any late antique baptismal structure still existing in the Mediterranean today. of seven circling bands turning around the central font, the mosaic features iconography relating both to Christianity and to aristocratic life.The Butrint baptistery mosaics feature two prominent scenes, each strongly evoking Christian iconography befitting a baptismal theme. In one, peacocks are depicted {{on either side of}} a kantharos, out of which dangle <b>vines</b> <b>bearing</b> clusters of grapes. According to Mitchell, as peacock flesh was believed not to decompose, the appearance of the animal in late antique art would have symbolized eternal life. The other main scene depicts two stags at a fountain, a reference to a verse from Psalm 42 (“As the hart panteth for the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.”). Together, the two images connect water with the concept of everlasting life.|$|R
60|$|The Land of Canaan {{was very}} unlike Egypt, with its flat soil, dry climate, and single river. It was a narrow strip, {{inclosed}} between the Mediterranean Sea {{and the river}} Jordan, which runs due south down a steep wooded cleft into the Dead Sea, the lowest water in the world, {{in a sort of}} pit of its own, with barren desolation all round it, so as to keep in memory the ruin of the cities of the plain. In the north, rise the high mountains of Libanus, a spur from which goes the whole length of the land, and forms two slopes, whence the rivers flow, either westward into the Great Sea, or eastward into the Jordan, Many of these hills are too dry and stony to be cultivated; but the slopes of some have fine grassy pastures, and the soil of the valleys is exceedingly rich, <b>bearing</b> figs, <b>vines,</b> olive trees, and corn in plenty, wherever it is properly tilled. With such hills, rivers, valleys, and pastures, it was truly a goodly land, and when God's blessing was on it, it was the fairest spot where man could live. When the Israelites entered it, every hill was crowned by a strongly-walled and fortified town, the abode of some little king of one of the seven Canaanite nations who were given into their hands to be utterly destroyed. Though they were commanded to make a complete end of all the people in each place they took, they were forbidden to seize more than they could till, lest the empty ruins should serve as a harbour for wild beasts; but they had their several lots marked out where they might spread when their numbers should need room. As Jacob had promised to Joseph, Ephraim and half Manaseh had the richest portion, nearly in the middle, and Shiloh, where the Tabernacle was set up, was in their territory; Judah and Benjamin were in a very wild rocky part to the southwards, between the two seas, with only Simeon beyond them; then came, north of Manasseh, the fine pasture lands of Issachar and Zebulon, and a small border for Asher between Libanus and the sea; while Reuben, Gad, and the rest of Manasseh, were to the east of the Jordan, where they had begged to settle themselves in the meadows of Bashan, and the balmy thickets of Gilead.|$|R
40|$|Background: Global {{climate change}} will noticeably affect plant {{vegetative}} and reproductive development. The recent increase in temperatures has already impacted yields {{and composition of}} berries in many grapevine-growing regions. Physiological processes underlying temperature response and tolerance of the grapevine fruit have not been extensively investigated. To date, all studies investigating the molecular regulation of fleshly fruit response to abiotic stress were only conducted during the day, overlooking possible critical night-specific variations. The present study explores the night and day transcriptomic response of grapevine fruit to heat stress at several developmental stages. Short heat stresses (2 h) were applied at day and night to <b>vines</b> <b>bearing</b> clusters sequentially ordered according to the developmental stages along their vertical axes. The recently proposed microvine model (DRCF-Dwarf Rapid Cycling and Continuous Flowering) was grown in climatic chambers in order to circumvent common constraints and biases inevitable in field experiments with perennial macrovines. Post-véraison berry heterogeneity within clusters was avoided by constituting homogenous batches following organic acids and sugars measurements of individual berries. A whole genome transcriptomic approach was subsequently conducted using NimbleGen 090818 Vitis 12 X (30 K) microarrays. Results: Present work reveals significant differences in heat stress responsive pathways according to day or night treatment, in particular regarding genes associated with acidity and phenylpropanoid metabolism. Precise distinction of ripening stages led to stage-specific detection of malic acid and anthocyanin-related transcripts modulated by heat stress. Important changes in cell wall modification related processes as well as indications for heat-induced delay of ripening and sugar accumulation were observed at véraison, an effect that was reversed at later stages. Conclusions: This first day - night study on heat stress adaption of the grapevine berry shows that the transcriptome of fleshy fruits is differentially affected by abiotic stress at night. The present results emphasize the necessity of including different developmental stages and especially several daytime points in transcriptomic studies...|$|R
