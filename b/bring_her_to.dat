5|$|In {{her early}} to mid-thirties, {{she became a}} lady-in-waiting (nyōbō) at court, most likely because of her {{reputation}} as an author.

Bowring sees no evidence that she was brought to court as Michinaga's concubine, although he did <b>bring</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> court without following official channels. Mulhern thinks Michinaga wanted to have Murasaki at court to educate his daughter Shōshi.|$|E
