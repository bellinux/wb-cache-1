Both brothers served in the Chemical Warfare Service in World War I and on the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota's winters are {{the setting}} of several {{television}} programs and Hollywood films, including the 1996 film Fargo which features the backdrop of a Minnesota winter, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> most {{of the characters in}} the movie, the climate is portrayed as bleak and inhospitable.|$|E
5|$|The 98th Regiment of Foot, {{raised in}} 1824 in Chichester, {{had a much}} shorter history, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> the 64th had spent the {{majority}} of its time overseas spending a long time in South Africa before seeing action in China in the First Anglo-Chinese (or Opium) War and India on the North West Frontier. It was based in Afghanistan when the amalgamation occurred.|$|E

5|$|The {{market for}} supercars was growing when the {{production}} XJ220 was announced, with comparable cars immediately reselling after delivery {{for three and}} four times the list price. The Ferrari F40 had been selling for more than £800,000 in 1990, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> the XJ220 it was adversely affected by the recession, and by 1992 prices had dropped to between £100,000 to £150,000.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{chemical}} compounds are known to exhibit one or several liquid crystalline phases. Despite significant differences in chemical composition, these molecules have some common features in chemical and physical properties. There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotics, bowlics and rod-shaped molecules. Discotics are flat disc-like molecules consisting of a core of adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a bowlic is not flat <b>but</b> <b>like</b> a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object). This allows for two dimensional columnar ordering, for both discotics and bowlics. Rod-shaped molecules have an elongated, anisotropic geometry which allows for preferential alignment along one spatial direction.|$|E
5|$|Air Force {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the second half and started at its 20-yard line after a touchback. The Falcons drove into Tech territory, but the Hokies' defense forced the Falcons to punt near midfield, and Tech took over at 12:23 in the quarter at its 24-yard line after a short return. As had Air Force, Tech picked {{up a couple of}} first downs. <b>But</b> <b>like</b> Air Force, the opposition's defense forced a punt near midfield. Following the punt, Air Force took over at its 20-yard line with 9:09 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane had been scheduled to be on the flight but arrived at the airport late. Actor Mark Wahlberg was also scheduled to be on the flight but canceled his ticket at the last minute. Actress Leighanne Littrell, wife of Backstreet Boys singer Brian Littrell, had also previously been booked on the flight, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> Wahlberg, changed her plans at the last minute.|$|E
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of Macabeemyrma ovata {{may have been}} similar to extant Myrmeciinae ants. The ant is large with long legs and elongated mandibles. It presumably had large eyes {{that were used to}} hunt for prey and navigation, and the ant was possibly equipped with a sting. Colonies most likely nested in the soil like most other Myrmeciinae, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> some Myrmecia species it is possible they were an arboreal nesting species. Workers were solitary foragers, foraging on the ground or onto vegetation while preying on arthropods. Workers most likely did not recruit other ants to food sources or lay down pheromone trails.|$|E
5|$|As Swedish is a Germanic language, the syntax shows {{similarities}} to both English and German. Like English, Swedish has a subject–verb–object basic word order, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> German, it utilizes verb-second word order in main clauses, for instance after adverbs, adverbial phrases and dependent clauses. (Adverbial phrases denoting time are usually {{placed at the}} beginning of a main clause that is at the head of a sentence.) Prepositional phrases are placed in a place–manner–time order, as in English (but not German). Adjectives precede the noun they modify.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{morphological}} similarities, the Sumatran rhinoceros {{is believed}} to be closely related to the extinct woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis). The woolly rhinoceros, so named for the coat of hair it shares with the Sumatran rhinoceros, first appeared in China; by the Upper Pleistocene, it ranged across the Eurasian continent from Korea to Spain. The woolly rhinoceros survived the last Ice Age, <b>but,</b> <b>like</b> the woolly mammoth, most or all became extinct around 10,000 years ago. Although some morphological studies questioned the relationship, recent molecular analysis has supported the two species as sister taxa.|$|E
5|$|Both vessels saw action {{during the}} Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, where Lüft-ü Celil was sunk by a Russian {{artillery}} battery on the Danube. Hifz-ur Rahman engaged Russian minelayers {{at the mouth}} of the Danube but otherwise saw little action. She survived the war and was laid up for the following twenty years. She was mobilized at the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> the rest of the Ottoman fleet, was in poor condition. The ship was eventually sold in 1909 and broken up.|$|E
5|$|Constantine's {{death in}} 952 is {{recorded}} by the Irish annals, who enter it among ecclesiastics. His son Indulf would become king on Malcolm's death. The last of Constantine's certain descendants to be king in Alba was a great-grandson, ConstantineIII (Constantín mac Cuiléin). Another son had died at Brunanburh, and, according to John of Worcester, Amlaíb mac Gofraid {{was married to a}} daughter of Constantine. It is possible that Constantine had other children, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> the name of his wife, or wives, this has not been recorded.|$|E

5|$|Darlington's {{promotion}} campaign was dealt a blow in February 2009, when club chairman George Houghton placed {{the club in}} administration. As a result, the club were deducted 10points, a penalty from which they could not recover finally finishing 12th. Burgmeier finished with two goals during the season having played 35games, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> {{the rest of the}} playing squad, was told he could find a new club by Darlington's administrators.|$|E
5|$|Derrick did {{not join}} up when war broke out in September 1939 <b>but,</b> <b>like</b> many Australians, enlisted {{after the fall of}} France in June 1940. He joined the Second Australian Imperial Force on 5 July 1940, and was posted to the 2/48th Battalion, 26th Brigade, as a private. Derrick first joined his unit at the Wayville Showgrounds, before basic {{training}} at Woodside. Derrick thrived on military life, but found discipline difficult to accept.|$|E
5|$|East Midwood was {{organized}} in 1924 by Jacob R. Schwartz, a dentist who {{was concerned that}} his two sons had no nearby Hebrew school which they could attend. From the start his intention had been to create a Conservative synagogue: Conservative Judaism {{was seen as a}} compromise between Orthodox and Reform, providing the familiar (and lengthy) Hebrew services of Orthodox Judaism, <b>but,</b> <b>like</b> Reform, adding some English prayers. East Midwood differed from earlier Ashkenazi synagogues in New York, as services were to be conducted in Hebrew and English only (not Hebrew and Yiddish), and the members were to come from immigrants from all over Europe, not just one city or region.|$|E

5|$|In 1775, Nash {{served in}} the Third North Carolina Provincial Congress, which {{organized}} eight regiments of soldiers on instructions from the Continental Congress. Later that year, the Provincial Congress appointed Nash lieutenant colonel of the 1st North Carolina Regiment {{under the command of}} then-colonel James Moore. In November, the 1st North Carolina was formally integrated into the Continental Army organization. Nash served as an officer under Moore during the maneuvers that led up to the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge in February 1776 <b>but,</b> <b>like</b> Moore, did not participate in the battle, arriving after its conclusion.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, when Bakili Muluzi became president, he {{addressed}} the nation's need for a coordinated response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In 2000, Muluzi introduced another five-year policy known as the National Strategic Framework, <b>but,</b> <b>like</b> Banda's five-year World Bank Medium Term Plan, this plan was largely ineffective. In 2001, in response to problems within the National AIDS Control Programme established by Banda, Muluzi created the National AIDS Commission. Unlike Banda, who prevented the public from accessing information about the epidemic, Muluzi ensured that information about HIV/AIDS was available {{on the radio and}} television, in newspapers, and on billboards. However, despite Muluzi's efforts, HIV prevalence was already significantly influencing national agricultural productivity during this period, and Malawi experienced an AIDS-related nationwide famine in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are large}} enough {{structures}} {{to have some}} of the mechanical properties of liquids or solids. The area compression modulus Ka, bending modulus Kb, and edge energy , can be used to describe them. Solid lipid bilayers also have a shear modulus, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> any liquid, the shear modulus is zero for fluid bilayers. These mechanical properties affect how the membrane functions. Ka and Kb affect the ability of proteins and small molecules to insert into the bilayer, and bilayer mechanical properties have been shown to alter the function of mechanically activated ion channels. Bilayer mechanical properties also govern what types of stress a cell can withstand without tearing. Although lipid bilayers can easily bend, most cannot stretch more than a few percent before rupturing.|$|E
