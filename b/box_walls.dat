40|$|Even though {{improvements}} in modeling the phenomena {{that occur in}} the lower plenum have been made, the MELCOR user must decide on the physical events that are to be modeled and create the corresponding input. In addition to the standard modeling techniques, the flexibility of MELCOR allows for nontraditional modeling as well. For typical BWR applications, the user establishes concentric radial rings for the COR Package. In theory, each ring should be composed of a channel (within the channel <b>box</b> <b>walls)</b> and a bypass (the volume region outside the channel <b>box</b> <b>walls)</b> with each region containing both fluid and structures. However, in MELCOR 1. 8. 3 and earlier versions, the COR Package allows particulate debris to relocate only inside the channel <b>box</b> <b>walls,</b> using a volume equivalent to the channel and bypass fluid volumes. The consequences of this modeling approach with respect to the combined channel and bypass volumes produces two anomalies in the BWR calculation, particularly for boildown sequences. The first is that the CVH Package will calculate inaccurate channel and bypass water levels for the core region, which can significantly affect predicted metal-water reaction rates. The other is that lack of separation of the channel and bypass volumes will cause an artificially large flow area through the core plate, which can lead to inaccurately determined core plate failure times and unrealistic pressure transients in the lower plenum. In an effort to mitigate the consequences of the current COR package treatment of BWR channel and bypass volumes, an atypical way of modeling the core region by doubling the number of rings so that each ring represents only a channel or bypass region has been developed and {{has been shown to be}} beneficial...|$|E

40|$|Crash Box {{is a very}} {{important}} part as absorbing impact energy, especially in the frontal crash case. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the optimal design on two circular cross sections Crash Box to its ability to absorb impact energy and deformation pattern. The independent variable in this study were length, and thickness of the Crash Box with length of tube 1 (h) = length of tube 2 (h 2) = 40, 50, 60 mm and thickness of tube 1 (t 201 1 1) = thickness of tube 2 (t) = 2, 5; 3; 3. 5 mm were analyzed by the Taguchi method. The dependent variable is the energy absorbed and the deformation that occurs in Crash Box due to the impact test (Impactor) and is measured by using finite element-based software which is Ansys 14. 5. Based on data from the simulation results, it can be obtained on one circular cross section Crash Box has the ability to absorb the energy of 2762. 89 A. For optimum design of two circular cross sections Crash Box has the ability to absorb the energy of 4435. 04 J. Optimum design of Crash Box has length of tube 1 (h 1) = 40 mm, length of tube 2 (h 2) = 60 mm, thickness of tube 1 (t) = 3. 5 mm, thickness of tube 2 (t) = 3 mm.

Regarding the gabion box wall, it has been performed some calculations and analysis {{in order to understand the}} static and dynamic behavior. From the static point of view, it has been performed a verification of the normal stress computing the normal stress that arrives at the base of the gabion wall and the corresponding capacity of the ground. Moreover, regarding the seismic analysis, it has been studied the in-plane and out-of-plane behavior. The most critical aspect was discovered to be the out-of-plane behavior, for which have been developed models considering the “rigid- no tension model” for masonry, finding a kinematically admissible multiplier that will create a collapse mechanism for the structure. Furthermore, it has been performed a FEM and DEM models to find the maximum displacement at the center of the wall, maximum tension stresses needed for calculating the steel connectors for joining consecutive gabions and the dimensions (length of the wall and distance between orthogonal walls or buttresses) of a geometrical configuration for the standard modulus of the structure, in order to ensure an adequate safety margin for earthquakes with a PGA around 0. 4 - 0. 5 g.

40|$|The {{crushing}} {{behavior of}} partially Al closed-cell foam filled commercial 1050 H 14 Al crash boxes was determined at quasi-static and dynamic deformation velocities. The quasi-static and dynamic crushing {{of the boxes}} were simulated using the LS-DYNA. The results showed that partial foam filling tended to change the deformation mode of empty boxes from a non-sequential to a sequential folding mode. In general, the experimental and simulation results showed similar mean load values and deformation modes. The SEA values of empty, partially and fully foam filled boxes were predicted as function of <b>box</b> <b>wall</b> thickness between 1 and 3 mm and foam filler relative density between 0 and 0. 2, using the analytical equations developed for the mean crushing loads. The analysis indicated that both fully and partially foam filled boxes were energetically more efficient than empty boxes above a critical foam filler relative density. Partial foam filling, however, decreases the critical foam filler density at increasing <b>box</b> <b>wall</b> thicknesses. TÜBİTAK for the grant # 106 M 18...|$|R

40|$|A secure {{communication}} {{system based on}} the error-feedback synchronization of the electronic model of the particle-in-a-box system is proposed. This circuit allows a robust and simple electronic emulation of the mechanical behavior of the collisions of a particle inside a box, exhibiting rich chaotic behavior.

A master/slave synchronization of two circuits exhibiting a rich chaotic behavior demonstrates the potentiality of this system to {{secure communication}}. In this system, binary data stream information modulates the bifurcation parameter of the particle-in-a-box electronic circuit in the transmitter. In the receiver circuit, this parameter is estimated using Pecora-Carroll synchronization and error-feedback synchronization. The performance of the demodulation process is verified through the eye pattern technique applied on the recovered bit stream. During the demodulation process, the error-feedback synchronization presented better performance compared with the Pecora-Carroll synchronization.

40|$|Centrifuge {{modelling}} {{is commonly}} {{accepted as a}} valuable tool for research on earthquake-induced phenomena, its significance depending on proper simulation of boundary conditions. This is a controversial aspect of centrifuge modelling of soil’s dynamic behaviour, especially if involving liquefaction, as the issue of significant soil stiffness and shear strength degradation with increasing strain, which should ideally be reproduced by the physical boundaries of the centrifuge model, becomes much more pertinent. Centrifuge tests performed on uniform deposits of saturated sand at Cambridge University highlight the boundary effects caused by a deep Equivalent Shear Beam (ESB) container. Excess pore pressure and accelerations in the centre and edges of models of dense and loose sand are compared, illustrating the adverse effects of the boundaries, which increase with progressive soil softening during shaking due to rising excess pore pressures. The results show that, during the earthquake, boundaries significantly affect the soil’s dynamic response and the transient excess pore pressure close to the <b>box</b> <b>walls,</b> but also suggest that the soil behaviour observed in the model's centre is authentic. As a result, provided that model edges are disregarded, ESB containers are suitable for centrifuge modelling of earthquake-induced liquefaction...|$|E
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of September 2005, itx, a photoinitiator used in uv cured ink, has been identified to have migrated from packaging to food products. Tetra Pak has identified the source of migration to be uv cured offset printing ink. The presence of itx in food packed in Tetra Pak bricks {{is the result of}} the contamination of the inner polyethylene layer of the <b>box</b> <b>walls.</b> itx can either migrate through the packaging material or it can reach the food by contact, for example, as a result of the print set-off phenomenon. Most likely, the transfer of itx was due to the physical contact between the printed outer layer with the inner layer of the packaging, whereby the ink or ink substance transfers from the print to the reverse of the adjacent sheet. Tetra Pak has committed itself to move away from this technology immediately and to use alternative printing technologies to ensure that there is no or minimal migration of itx or other substances from its packages. itx is still not on the eu’s negative list of banned substances in food nor does the World Health Organization (who) categorize it as being detrimental to human health.

The quasi-static crushing of empty and filled crash boxes was simulated using LS-DYNA, {{and the results were}} further confirmed with experimental quasi-static crushing testing of empty and Alulight foam-filled commercial 1050 H 14 Al crash boxes. Results showed that partial foam filling of commercial crash boxes increased both SEA and mean load because of foam filler axial and lateral deformation in between the progressing folds of the crash box. Within the studied constraint range of box mean load, <b>box</b> <b>wall</b> thickness and foam filler density, the optimised Alulight and Hydro foam-filled 1050 H 14 and 6061 T 4 crash boxes resulted in 26 %– 40 % increase in total energy absorption as compared with empty crash boxes.

40|$|Abstract. The {{principle}} of NC incremental {{sheet metal forming}} {{as well as the}} process planning, experiment of the square conical box forming are presented. Because the deformation of sheet metal only occurs around the tool head and the deformed region is subjected to stretch deformation and thins, and surface area increases. Sheet metal forming stepwise is to lead to the whole sheet metal deformation. The sine law indicates that the thickness of the square conical <b>box</b> <b>wall</b> is close to zero when the half-apex angle of the square conical <b>box</b> <b>wall</b> is close to zero. Therefore, we must know the forming limit half-apex angle to ensure that the forming can be carried out successfully, i. e., to ensure that the deformed region with a certain thickness will not fracture. It will succeed in square conical box incremental forming in a single tool-path if the forming is carried out with an angle which is larger than the forming limit half-apex angle. The fracture in the forming component can be avoided by these methods. A square conical box of uniform wall-thickness can be formed by NC incremental forming process. The thickness of deformation area is increased by increasing half-apex angle. The wrinkle in the forming component can be avoided by these methods...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the noise {{propagation}} through a solid medium {{is considered to}} study how {{the parameters of the}} statistical model change. In particular the external and internal sound fields of a box are taken into account. It is experimentally shown that the variance of the real and the imaginary parts of the external stationary random noise change differently while going through the <b>box</b> <b>walls.</b> The generalized Rayleigh distribution is shown to be more suitable to model the noise inside the cavity instead of the classical Rayleigh distribution. Starting from this outcome it has been studied how this noise affects a signal. It is known that a signal modulus affected by stationary random noise can be described by using the Rice distribution if the real and imaginary parts of the noise are statistically independent and identically distributed with zero mean and equal variances. Otherwise the less popular generalized Rice distribution must be used. The main differences of using the Rice or the generalized Rice distributions are shown by considering phasors both with constant and variable phases. In this paper it is shown that the bias estimation depends on the phase of the phasor if the variances of the real and imaginary parts are different and a numerical quantification is given. The attained results are useful when performing measurements of the sound pressure field due to a sound source inside a cavity affected by external noise...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} thermodynamical {{behavior}} of black holes in closed finite boxes. First {{the black hole}} mass evolution is analyzed in an initially empty box. Using the conservation of the energy and the Hawking evaporation flux, we deduce a minimal volume above which one black hole can loss all of its mass to the box, a result which agrees with the previous analysis made by Page. We then obtain analogous results using a box initially containing radiation, allowed to be absorbed by the black hole. The equilibrium times and masses are evaluated and their behavior discussed to highlight some interesting features arising. These results are generalized to N black holes + thermal radiation. Using physically simple arguments, we prove that these black holes achieve the same equilibrium masses (even that the initial masses were different). The entropy {{of the system is}} used to obtain the dependence of the equilibrium mass on the box volume, number of black holes and the initial radiation. The equilibrium mass is shown to be proportional to a positive power law of the effective volume (contrary to naive expectations), a result explained in terms of the detailed features of the system. The effect of the reflection of the radiation on the <b>box</b> <b>walls</b> which comes back into the black hole is explicitly considered. All these results (some of them counter-intuitive) may be useful to formulate alternative problems in thermodynami...|$|E

A visual method reinforced by a dye (Kuraray, Japan) {{was used to evaluate}} accuracy of the conventional methods. Two hundred and four teeth with cavities (class i and ii) already confirmed caries free by specialists in patients were chosen. The cavities dried and stained with a drop of the dye and were washed by water after 10 sec. Chi-square and z-tests were used for statistical analyses. The remained caries, especially in dentinoenamel junction (DEJ) stained dark pink color. Out of 102 class I cavities, 43 (42 %) were stained in DEJ (10 in mesial, 14 in distal, 19 in buccal and 19 in lingual walls). Out of 102 class ii cavities, 49 (48 %) were stained in DEJ (27 in gingival, 10 in lingual, 19 in buccal, 3 in mesial or distal (axial), 19 in buccal box and 8 in lingual <b>box</b> <b>walls).</b> The difference observed between class I and class ii cavities was not significant (p< 0. 05).
