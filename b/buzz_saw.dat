5|$|BuzzSaw is themed {{around a}} series of unexplainable occurrences in the Town of Gold Rush which {{date back to the}} late 1800s. In 1876, the Town of Gold Rush was formed. It was a prosperous town during the great gold rush. Eleven years later, in 1887, the town's Gold supply was {{completely}} gone. The town then established a sawmill and turned their focus to timber. On a clear moon-lit night, a sawmill worker named Jack Darke was killed by the <b>buzz</b> <b>saw</b> after he had a scuffle with some other workers who were attempting to set the building on fire. The circumstances leading up to his death were covered up by the town with the legend stating that Jack tried to burn down the sawmill and slipped into the path of the <b>buzz</b> <b>saw.</b> The sawmill has remained closed since with many people claiming encounters with the ghost of Jack on nights similar to that of his death.|$|E

40|$|Students and {{teachers}} at Hand Middle School in Columbia, South Carolina, {{were in the}} midst of a two-year, comprehensive renovation and construction project in which some sections of their 75 -year-old, historic building were being renovated and new sections added. When parts of the school were boarded up and oversized machinery first moved onto campus, approximately half of the students moved into portables. Classrooms and other academic areas were closed, including the school's media center, which would be unavailable to students while the space for a new, larger media center was being prepared. Amidst the clang of machinery, the <b>buzz</b> of <b>saws,</b> the shouts of workmen, and the high whine of drills, the media specialist, the literacy coach, and a seventh grade English/language arts teacher collaborated to develop a plan that would offset the closing of the media center for a year and would keep books in the hands of students. In this unlikely setting, they created a kind of literary ecosystem in which equilibrium between the community of construction and the community of learning was maintained, creating a balance between bedlam and books, between renovations and reading.

40|$|There is a {{biodiversity}} {{crisis in}} our midst. An abundance {{of technology and}} innovation in the last 200 years has revamped our world but {{at the cost of}} pushing many species to extinction. Since the passing of the Endangered Species Act by Congress in 1973, more than 100 species in the United States have disappeared (Wilson 2006). The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) stats that 2 ̆ 219, 265 species out of the 59, 507 so far assessed as threatened with extinction, 2 ̆ 2 (IUCN 2011). Extinction {{is the result of a}} combination of factors caused by human environmental disturbance. Disturbances in the form of habitat loss, overexploitation, invasive species, global climate change, disease, and pollution are impacting biological diversity of Earth as we know it (IUCN 2011). These disturbances are directly tied to human activity. As human activity increase, environments key for species survival vanish. Humanity destroys natural habitats every day in order to obtain resources required at current standard of living. Habitat loss is seen in the form of deforestation, urban sprawl, and desertification. As the agriculture industry grows so does the need for land to grow crops, which in turn requires the destruction of forest regions. Urban sprawl comes from swelling population; cities grow outward to account for the housing requirements. Desertification is the process of turning once arable land into an arid zone, unable to support its former in habitants and is the product of climate change. Overexploitation, the unsustainable use of a natural resource, is notable in commercial and recreational fisheries. It has been identified as problematic, yet is a continued practice. Overexploitation results in overfishing and low stock levels (Rosenburg 2003). Climate change is attributable to burning fossil fuels and introducing other types of pollution in the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s atmosphere. The result, a rise in concentrations of greenhouse gases, which keep temperatures higher on Earth then they would be otherwise (U. S. EPA 2010). Invasive and introduced species, species that do not belong in a given habitat, bring great harm to native species. Competition ensues and invasive species, lacking natural predators, may have the ability to take over, 2 ̆ 2 establish and spread outside of their normal distribution, 2 ̆ 2 (IUCN 2011). With them, invasive species can bring disease further hindering survivability of native species. These factors influence each other, contributing to the destructive cycle. Biodiversity is essential to human livelihood. Biological diversity, 2 ̆ 2 refers to the wide variety of living things and systems on planet Earth ranging from microbes and viruses all the way up (in scale) to entire ecosystems, 2 ̆ 2 (Grayling 2010). According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, 2 ̆ 2 Biodiversity is crucial to human wellbeing, sustainable development and poverty reduction, 2 ̆ 2 (IUCN 2010). We see the importance of this concept in medicinal plant use, gene pools of livestock animals and crop plants, and global food security. Over 70, 000 plant species have been tied to traditional and modern medicine. Biodiversity grants 2 ̆ 2 freedom of choice 2 ̆ 2 (IUCN 2010) whic exemplifies the importance of a large gene pool for livestock and crops. A large gene pool decreases the risk for DNA mutations which can cause disease. It has been said that ecosystem productivity, all the growth of plants in a set time period, increase when the number of plant species is higher. Variability in communities allows for more resource capture and essentially more productivity (Tilman 1997). The continued depletion of natural resources and genetic variability, an increase in the numbers of diseases and continued climate change may ultimately affect long-term human survivorship. It is important to education societies of the dangers that lie in the years ahead if proper actions and changes are not met. Due to the high-risk state that biodiversity is in, awareness of the issue is more important than ever, but in order to combat the problem, species conservation will be the fulcrum to biodiversity 2 ̆ 7 s continued existence. Conservation efforts are being implemented across the globe to educate people about the threats to wildlife caused by bulldozers and <b>buzz</b> <b>saws</b> along with employing various means to fight against exploitation and unsustainable practices. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the worlds 2 ̆ 7 first, global environmental organization. It was founded in 1948 and is a network of Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) and government organizations, with over 1, 000 members in 140 countries (IUCN 2011). Throughout its network of membership IUCN is able to initiate a multitude of field projects, support scientific research, generate and execute policies, laws and practices (IUCN 2011). In 1963, IUCN members held a meeting to discuss the increase of wildlife and plant trade across international borders. This meeting resulted in adopting a new resolution, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). CITES is a voluntary agreement between governments throughout the world that promotes international cooperation to safeguard species from overexploitation (CITES 2011). Currently, 175 different countries are participating members. The primary goal of CITES is to ensure that international trade of animal and plant species does not affect species survivorship and livelihood (CITES 2011). This organization, 2 ̆ 2 works by subjecting international trade in specimens of selected species to certain controls 2 ̆ 2 (CITES 2011). A licensing system overseen by a Management Authority and Scientific Authority in each participating country controls what species may be exported, imported, introduced, or reexported based on their current status. Each member nation acts like a legal 2 ̆ 2 checks and balances 2 ̆ 2 system which strengthens the efforts they are trying to achieve. Conservation efforts are not only being practices at an international level but also in our backyards. In the United States conservation promotion and awareness are made primarily through NGOs, such as the Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club, and the National Wildlife Federation. Conservation is a necessity to solving the biodiversity crisis. Public policy is one of the many routes readily working towards goals of species and habitat preservation. Environmental legislation varies between countries. This thesis seeks to understand the way conservation is practiced in the United States of America and Australia. I begin by comparing the history of environmental legislation in each country. I then look at the activity of non-governmental organizations interested in conservation. Finally, I use an endangered species endemic to each nation to compare the effectiveness of the conservation effort...|$|R

40|$|Resident at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and The University of Notre Dame Australia medical graduate, Dr Rhys Clark, has {{developed}} iDoctor, an iPhone application designed to assist training medicos {{to keep track}} of their professional development and patient caseloads. The internationally-rated, 4. 5 star iTunes application allows users to log hospital cases and export them to Excel and other spreadsheet programs. Data is saved in a procedural logbook, including the option to save details based on procedure performed, category-based patient identifiers, role, supervisor and an option to attach a photograph taken with the iPhone. Dr Clark said once doctors had reached a required number of supervised procedures, it was simple to then email and print the spreadsheet for authorisation. “Ticker wheels permit users to enter the procedures or operations specific to their speciality and these are saved for use next time a procedure is entered,” said Dr Clark. Dr Clark said he saw a need for junior doctors to keep accurate records of their experiences on-the-go and iDoctor provided an essential toolbox of assorted logs to enable them to keep their CVs up-to-date with educational and professional development activities. “As training positions become increasingly competitive and we move towards experience-based credentialing this app becomes vital in order {{to keep track of}} procedures performed,” he said. “Before the application, I found myself often collecting patient stickers to keep records of cases I had been involved in for my surgical logbook or for follow up. ” During iDoctor’s development phase, Dr Clark asked interns, residents, registrars and consultants to test the application in their particular field. He then adapted the application to suit the changes suggested by colleagues prior to its release on the iTunes store. Dr Clark said he also received feedback regarding tracking hours worked as many doctors reported they were often too busy to record overtime and were not keeping track of the wages owed to them. “I have also missed out on many dollars owed to me. Often we will work late or be asked to take extra shifts beyond our normal paid hours. In order to keep track of these hours I also developed a logbook for overtime within iDoctor,” he said. Dr Clark said he would continue to develop iDoctor as new software became available and valuable feedback from colleagues was received. “I have plenty of other ideas but at this stage we are just focusing on rolling out this app and having doctors using it in their every day working lives,” he said. Since iDoctor’s release in June, Dr Clark said he had been overwhelmed by positive feedback received from colleagues using the software. “At first I got a real <b>buzz</b> when I <b>saw</b> people using it on the wards or in medical meetings, however this is now becoming common place,” he said. “Many doctors have told me how useful they find it and lots ask for it to be made more specific to their specialty which we are looking at doing. ” Part proceeds from the sale of iDoctor will go to Australian Doctors for Africa, a charity providing volunteer doctors and nurses to areas of need in Africa.

Be good or go." [...] "You don't mean you will sign that thing unread?" [...] "Make yourself useful then, and read it for me. [...] Isn't it something I have seen before?" [...] "You'll find it is. Let your friend look at it." [...] "Yes, but all that takes time, and I'm as much [...] In haste to get it over with as you. [...] But read it, read it. That's right, draw the curtain: [...] Half the time I don't know what's troubling me.-- [...] What do you say, Will? Don't you be a fool, [...] You! crumpling folkses legal documents. [...] Out with it if you've any real objection." [...] "Five hundred dollars!" [...] "What would you think right?" [...] "A thousand wouldn't be a cent too much; [...] You know it, Mr. Lawyer. The sin is [...] Accepting anything before he knows [...] Whether he's ever going to walk again. [...] It smells to me like a dishonest trick." [...] "I think--I think--from what I heard to-day-- [...] And saw myself--he would be ill-advised----" [...] "What did you hear, for instance?" [...] Willis said. [...] "Now the place where the accident occurred----" [...] The Broken One was twisted in his bed. [...] "This is between you two apparently. [...] Where I come in is what I want to know. [...] You stand up to it like a pair of cocks. [...] Go outdoors if you want to fight. Spare me. [...] When you come back, I'll have the papers signed. [...] Will pencil do? Then, please, your fountain pen. [...] One of you hold my head up from the pillow." [...] Willis flung off the bed. [...] "I wash my hands-- [...] I'm no match--no, and don't pretend to be----" [...] The lawyer gravely capped his fountain pen. [...] "You're doing the wise thing: you won't regret it. [...] We're very sorry for you." [...] Willis sneered: [...] "Who's we?--some stockholders in Boston? [...] I'll go outdoors, by gad, and won't come back." [...] "Willis, bring Anne back with you when you come. [...] Yes. Thanks for caring. Don't mind Will: he's savage. [...] He thinks you ought to pay me for my flowers. [...] You don't know what I mean about the flowers. [...] Don't stop to try to now. You'll miss your train. [...] Good-bye." [...] He flung his arms around his face.|$|R
