After the allotted four days passed, the Commissioner closed the <b>bidding</b> process and notified the posted player's NPB team of the highest bid amount but not who the <b>bidding</b> team was.

5000|$|There {{is often}} {{confusion}} between puppet <b>bids</b> and relays. A puppet <b>bid</b> requests partner {{to make the}} cheapest <b>bid</b> regardless of his hand.

A [...] "marionette" [...] <b>bid</b> {{is similar to a}} puppet <b>bid</b> except that it allows responses other than the cheapest <b>bid</b> with certain uncommon hand types.

Following this, a meeting was held on Ytter√∏y, where Fosen succeeded in securing a sufficient number of shares from the private owners to purchase the entire company. This valued the company at NOK23.1 million. Private owners were given the option to be paid in Fosen shares. From 1 July 2005, Innherredsferja was made a subsidiary of Fosen, but the company remained a separate limited company with its own board.|$|E

50|$|In a lowest unique <b>bid</b> auction, {{the bidder}} who {{submitted}} the single <b>bid</b> of $0.06 {{would win the}} auction, and would be eligible to purchase the product or service for $0.06, because their <b>bid</b> was the lowest unique <b>bid.</b> In a highest unique <b>bid</b> auction, the bidder who submitted a <b>bid</b> of $0.09 would win the auction.|$|R
50|$|This {{type of auction}} {{requires}} bidders {{to place}} <b>bids</b> that are global unique <b>bids.</b> That is, for a <b>bid</b> to be eligible to win no other bidder can have made a <b>bid</b> for the same amount.

50|$|<b>Bid</b> {{managers}} play {{an important}} role in outsourcing, where they produce and manage <b>bids</b> for companies structured to take on outsourcing projects from the government and industries.

The <b>bid</b> manager ensures that all customer-specified milestones are met and all deliverables of the <b>bid</b> are produced as specified. A <b>bid</b> manager's performance is normally evaluated based on the percentage of contracts he or she wins. <b>Bid</b> managers typically work with teams collected together from line functions for the temporary duration of the <b>bid</b> project, and hence need to have strong leadership skills to manage <b>bids</b> successfully. Good <b>bid</b> managers are in strong demand in the outsourcing industry.|$|R
