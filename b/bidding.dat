After the allotted four days passed, the Commissioner closed the <b>bidding</b> process and notified the posted player's NPB team of the highest bid amount but not who the <b>bidding</b> team was.

The diamond was flown to Gstaad in Switzerland so that the actress Elizabeth Taylor could see it, and flown back to the United States for the auction. Taylor's husband, the actor Richard Burton, had set a maximum bid of $1 million for the diamond, with his lawyer, Aaron Frosch, <b>bidding</b> on the telephone from London, and Al Yugler of the jewellers Frank Pollock and Sons, <b>bidding</b> in the room for Burton.|$|E

5000|$|There {{is often}} {{confusion}} between puppet <b>bids</b> and relays. A puppet <b>bid</b> requests partner {{to make the}} cheapest <b>bid</b> regardless of his hand. A relay <b>bid</b> requests partner to make a descriptive <b>bid</b> in response. The descriptive response can be natural (as in Stayman) or coded (as in Blackwood). A [...] "marionette" [...] <b>bid</b> {{is similar to a}} puppet <b>bid</b> except that it allows responses other than the cheapest <b>bid</b> with certain uncommon hand types. Thus technically it's a relay but with the cheapest <b>bid</b> expected most of the time.|$|R
50|$|Using Rubens advances, the {{available}} <b>bids</b> in the suits {{starting with the}} cue <b>bid</b> in opponent's suit {{up to and including}} the <b>bid</b> below a two-level support <b>bid</b> of the overcall are all transfer <b>bids</b> to the next suit.

The company would need expertise in both <b>bidding</b> and increased share capital to succeed in the <b>bidding.</b> By then, Fosen Trafikklag had bought 25% of the company, and the county and the municipality sold their shares to Fosen. Following this, a meeting was held on Ytterøy, where Fosen succeeded in securing a sufficient number of shares from the private owners to purchase the entire company. This valued the company at NOK23.1 million. Private owners were given the option to be paid in Fosen shares. From 1 July 2005, Innherredsferja was made a subsidiary of Fosen, but the company remained a separate limited company with its own board.|$|E

50|$|In a lowest unique <b>bid</b> auction, {{the bidder}} who {{submitted}} the single <b>bid</b> of $0.06 {{would win the}} auction, and would be eligible to purchase the product or service for $0.06, because their <b>bid</b> was the lowest unique <b>bid.</b> In a highest unique <b>bid</b> auction, the bidder who submitted a <b>bid</b> of $0.09 would win the auction.|$|R
50|$|This {{type of auction}} {{requires}} bidders {{to place}} <b>bids</b> that are global unique <b>bids.</b> That is, for a <b>bid</b> to be eligible to win no other bidder can have made a <b>bid</b> for the same amount.

50|$|<b>Bid</b> {{managers}} play {{an important}} role in outsourcing, where they produce and manage <b>bids</b> for companies structured to take on outsourcing projects from the government and industries.

The <b>bid</b> manager ensures that all customer-specified milestones are met and all deliverables of the <b>bid</b> are produced as specified. A <b>bid</b> manager's performance is normally evaluated based on the percentage of contracts he or she wins. <b>Bid</b> managers typically work with teams collected together from line functions for the temporary duration of the <b>bid</b> project, and hence need to have strong leadership skills to manage <b>bids</b> successfully. Good <b>bid</b> managers are in strong demand in the outsourcing industry.|$|R
