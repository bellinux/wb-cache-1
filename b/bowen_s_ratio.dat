40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} 11 S/ 7 <b>S</b> <b>ratios</b> on {{mechanical}} and barrier properties of soybean-protein-isolate films was evaluated. The tensile strength increased {{with an increase}} of 11 <b>S</b> globulin <b>ratio</b> when it was higher than 50 % in soybean-protein-isolate films, and decreased with an increase of 11 <b>S</b> globulin <b>ratio</b> when it was lower than 50 %. Moreover, the total soluble matter of soybean-protein-isolate films decreased with an increase of 11 <b>S</b> globulin <b>ratio,</b> while the elongation at break, moisture content, and optical transparency of soybean-protein-isolate films increased with an increase of 11 <b>S</b> globulin <b>ratio.</b> Furthermore, 11 S/ 7 <b>S</b> <b>ratios</b> had no influence on the water vapor permeability of soybean-protein-isolate films. These phenomenon mainly resulted from that the matrix of soybean-protein-isolate films was mainly maintained by disulfide bonds when 11 <b>S</b> globulin <b>ratio</b> was higher than 50 %, while that was maintained by intermolecular hydrogen bonds when 11 <b>S</b> globulin <b>ratio</b> was lower than 50 %...|$|R
40|$|Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} properties of any structural material including woven fabrics and textile materials. This coefficient determines important mechanical characteristics of fabrics in many applications, including a variety of composite systems containing textiles as a structural element. Due to the anisotropy of woven fabrics, Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> changes over the fabric sample stretching. In this paper, the practical application of the uniaxial testing of woven fabrics for determining its breaking properties and Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> is presented. Experimental testing was carried out on two different fabrics of a different raw material composition (cotton, wool) and of the same weave (plain weave). Samples were stretched with tensile force in the weft and warp direction, and based on the different measured values of the fabric stretching, warp and weft, Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> is calculated.

Here we report a lateral {{atomic force microscope}} experimental method to electromechanically measure the Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> and gauge factor of individual nanowires. Under elastic loading conditions we monitor the four-point resistance of individual metallic nanowires {{as a function of}} strain and different levels of electrical stress. We determine the gauge factor of individual wires and directly measure the Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> using a model that is independently validated for macroscopic wires. For macroscopic wires and nickel nanowires we find Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratios</b> that closely correspond to bulk values, whereas for silver nanowires significant deviations from the bulk silver value are observed. Moreover, repeated measurements on individual silver nanowires at different levels of mechanical and electrical stress yield a small spread in Poisson ratio, with a range of mean values for different wires, all of which are distinct from the bulk value...|$|R
40|$|The pumping {{potential}} (PP) of {{a structure}} {{is defined as}} the ratio of the relative volume change to a relative input stroke. It is introduced to evaluate the volumetric efficiency of a pump. The value of the PP is related to the geometric characteristics and the material properties of the pump structure. A single-layer hyperbolic shell-of-revolution flexible matrix composite (FMC) structure was investigated by Ghoneim and Noor. When under torsion, the rotation of the hyperbolic shell structure causes the throat diameter and the characteristic length to simultaneously decrease, rendering a substantial volumetric decrease and consequently a high PP. Some fibrous composite materials can have negative Effective Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio.</b> One of their most distinguished characteristics is that they laterally expand under stretching and contract under compression, while for an isotropic material having positive Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio,</b> it expands under compression and contracts under stretching. Therefore, when subjected to axial loading, the relative volume change of a structure made of negative Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> materials would be larger than the corresponding one made of a conventional material. When applied to a pump structure, this characteristic (negative effective Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio)</b> is expected to increase the pumping potential due to the larger relative volume change. For FMC laminates, when fiber orientation angles are properly set up, a high negative effective Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> can be obtained. As a result, structures made of these FMC laminates could engender a larger PP. Our work attempts to improve upon the PP of the single-layer hyperbolic shell structure by using multi-layer FMC materials with negative effective Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio.</b> The study is conducted both analytically and experimentally. The PP of FMC, with negative effective Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio,</b> cylindrical and hyperboloid structures using built-in Matlab codes as well as the ANSYS finite element package, is evaluated. In addition, hyperboloid FMC structures are built and tested. The analytical and experimental PP are compared. The work concludes that the negative Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> has considerably improved the PP of the hyperboloid structure...|$|R

The ratio decreased from 8 on March 15, 2011, to 0.8 on May 18, 2011, then stayed between 0.8 and 3.3 with gradual fluctuation. In a gas phase, the SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> changes by reaction (1), whose equilibrium constant {{is given by}} the Eq. (2). If the H 2 /H 2 O ratio, therefore the oxygen fugacity, is constant in the gas phase, a decrease of the SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> {{can be caused by}} a temperature decrease. Hydrogen, however, is a minor species compared with SO 2 and H 2 S, and the H 2 /H 2 O ratio commonly decreases with temperature as a result of reaction (1) under a constant SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> (gas buffer; Giggenbach, 1987). The H 2 /H 2 O ratio of the Shimoedake gas is 5 × 10 − 5, that is three orders of magnitude lower than that controlled by a QFM buffer, a common rock buffer, and {{it is unlikely that the}} SO 2 /H 2 S decrease is caused by a temperature decrease under a constant H 2 /H 2 O ratio. A pressure increase at a constant temperature and the H 2 /H 2 O ratio results in the SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> increase (Eq. (2)). The temperature and the oxygen fugacity is likely to be constant at the magma degassing condition, whereas the pressure can be variable. The ten times decrease of the ratio can be caused by a ten times increase of the degassing pressure. The gradual variation of the SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratios</b> between 0.8 and 3.3 can be similarly caused by a variation of the degassing pressure by four times.

Crustal thickness {{at each of the}} 11 broadband stations is estimated from the differential travel time between the Moho P-to-S converted phase and direct P. I demonstrated that this estimation is not sensitive to the average crustal P or S velocity, but is strongly dependent on the V p/V <b>s</b> <b>ratio.</b> The ambiguity is removed by adding a secondary converted phase to the analysis so that both thickness and V p/V <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> can be determined.

On average the northern Tibetan crust is 20 km thinner and has a higher V p/V <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> than the southern part. Teleseismic P and S arrival delays accurately measured by a multi-channel correlation technique exhibit large azimuthal and lateral variations. The delays after crustal correction indicate that the upper mantle velocities beneath the northern plateau are significantly slower too.
