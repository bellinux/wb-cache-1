40|$|The load {{capacity}} of long adhesive lap joints is often governed by stress concentrations at the lap ends. This paper investigates {{a method to}} minimize these stress concentrations by using a <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> with low shear stiffness and sufficient strength, here denoted as a resilient <b>bond</b> <b>line.</b> The resilient <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> is intended to increase the load carrying capacity of long lap joints by achieving a more uniform shear stress distribution while maintaining an elastic joint behaviour without damage or plastic deformation. The study comprises analytical, numerical and full-sized experimental work on double lap joints with lengths 200 – 700 mm comparing conventional stiff <b>bond</b> <b>lines</b> to resilient <b>bond</b> <b>lines.</b> Different resilient <b>bonds</b> <b>lines</b> were obtained by using rubber-like adhesives and by having a rubber mat within the <b>bond</b> <b>line.</b> An analytical definition of a ‘long’ lap joint is suggested and a study of adhesive-rubber bonding is also presented. The numerical analysis clearly indicates that an increase in load carrying capacity is made possible using resilient <b>bond</b> <b>lines.</b> A good agreement is also found between the numerical results and the analytical Volkersen theory, indicating that reasonable strength predictions {{can be obtained by}} hand calculations if the joint is designed in order to minimize the influence of peel stress. The experimental results of the resilient <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> verify the numerical findings, although production difficulties decrease the statistical significance of the result. On the contrary, the experimental results of the conventional <b>bond</b> <b>lines</b> significantly exceeded the numerical predictions, showing similar load carrying capacities to the resilient <b>bond</b> <b>line.</b> This is probably due to the specific boundary conditions used in the test setup. Despite some contradictory experimental results, the conclusion {{of this study is that}} the efficiency of long lap joints can be increased by the use of a <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> with low shear stiffness and sufficient strength...|$|R

40|$|The {{competitiveness}} of timber as structural material in large structures is often {{governed by the}} cost of structural joints. Tests indicate that the new joint concept presented herein using glued wood-to-steel plate joints can possibly reduce the cost by matching joint strength to member strength. The design is inspired by two previously proposed designs using a single large dowel and using a rubber foil interlayer in adhesive joints. Analytical 1 D and numerical 3 D models of the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> are proposed {{in order to further}} develop the concept, both {{in the case of a}} traditional adhesive joint and for the innovative rubber foil adhesive joint. The glued wood-to-steel plate joints studied are lap joints with a load bearing capacity assumed to be governed by failure within or along the <b>bond</b> <b>line.</b> In the 1 D and 3 D structural models both linear elastic and non-linear fracture mechanics were applied, with the non-linear fracture mechanics model taking into account the gradual damage fracture softening in a fracture zone. For the conventional type of <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> it was found that <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> softening needs to be considered for adequate strength analysis while it was not needed for a <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> with a rubber foil. The computational results are compared to previous full scale test results. The numerical results show good agreement and the analytical results reasonable agreement. When using a high strength adhesive, the strength of the wood along the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> is governing joint failure. For this case, the analyses predict a 150 % load bearing capacity increase by the introduction of a rubber foil as compared to a traditional design.

Such applications are often characterised by relatively thick, 0. 5 mm or more, adhesive joints and by a possible variability of the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> thickness associated with large-scale structures manufactured in boatyard environment. Experimental and numerical analysis in the case of shear tests are proposed to study the influence of <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> thickness on the mechanical behaviour of the adhesive. In order to accurately analyse the complete non-linear behaviour of an adhesive in an assembly, specimens with low edge effects have to be used. An increase in the thickness of the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> leads to an increase in the influence of the edge effects, computed under elastic assumption. As those numerical results are not able to completely analyse all the experimental observations, various 2 D simulations, with refined meshes, taking into account the non-linear behaviour of the adhesive are proposed to complete the analysis. Even for bonded assemblies with low edge effects, computed under elastic assumptions, the analysis of the stress distribution throughout the thickness of the joint, taking into account the non-linear behaviour of the adhesive underlines that an increase in the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> thickness leads to an increase in equivalent plastic deformation close to the free edges. This property can explain that an increase in the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> thickness can lead to a reduction in the transmitted load associated to crack initiation...|$|R

As a consequence of its operational environment, the USMC requires an efficient and effective rapid repair capability to maximize the serviceability of the CH- 53 K throughout its operational life. ^ In order to meet this need, Purdue University has developed a repair patch utilizing the vacuum assisted resin transfer molding process.

We test this hypothesis using a model composite consisting of perforated veneer that allowed a polyurethane adhesive to penetrate and reinforce veneers within the composite.

Our results clearly show that through-reinforcement, and also reinforcing adhesive <b>bond</b> <b>lines</b> with glass-fibre, significantly improved fracture toughness of the birch wood composite.

University of Maine researchers have constructed FRP-glulam girder bridges to serve as demonstrations, but with a design that does not fully utilize the FRP properties.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} {{in order to develop}} test methods and procedures for measuring the variation of the stress intensity factor through the thickness in bimaterial specimens containing cracks within and parallel to the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> using the frozen stress photoelastic method. Since stress freezing materials are incompressible above critical temperature, and since thick plates are to be employed which tend to produce a state of plane strain near the crack tip, the interface near tip fracture equations reduce to the classic form for homogeneous materials. Moreover, zero thickness interfaces do not exist when materials are bonded together. It was decided early on that it would be important to insure a uniform straight and accurate crack tip region through the thickness of the body to reduce scatter in the SIF distribution through the thickness. It was also observed that rubberlike materials which were desired to be modeled exhibited significant tip blunting prior to crack extension and that some blunting of the tip would provide a more realistic model. It should be noted that, in normal stress freezing photoelastic work, it is considered good practice to avoid utilizing data near <b>bond</b> <b>lines</b> in photoelastic models due to the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> stresses which inevitably develop when two parts are bonded together. Thus, the present study involves certain exploratory aspects in deviating from standard practice in stress freezing work.

Shear strength of the laminated samples and compression strength of upright-crossbar corner joints have been measured. The experimental results show that the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> strength of red oak is decreased by the conditioning processes. A reasonable explanation is that the conditioning process increases the swelling of the samples, and the high differential swelling between axial and transverse directions of red oak can contribute to lower <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> strength.
