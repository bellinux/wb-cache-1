40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to assess relative maternal and paternal genetic influences on <b>birth</b> <b>timing.</b> Study Design: Utilizing The Netherlands Twin Registry, we examined the correlation in <b>birth</b> <b>timing</b> of infants born to monozygotic (MZ) twins and their first-degree relatives (dizygotic twins and siblings of twins). Genetic models estimated the relative influence of genetic and common environmental factors through model fitting of additive genetic (A), common environmental (C), individual-specific environmental factors, and combinations thereof. Results: We evaluated <b>birth</b> <b>timing</b> correlation among the infants of 1390 twins and their 644 siblings. The correlation in MZ female twins (r = 0. 330) was greater than MZ male twins (r = - 0. 096). Positive correlation were also found in sister-sister pairs (r = 0. 223) but not in brother-brother (r = - 0. 045) or brother-sister pairs (r = - 0. 038). The most parsimonious AE model indicated a significant maternal contribution of genetic and individual-specific environmental factors to <b>birth</b> <b>timing,</b> but no paternal heritability was demonstrated. Heritability of <b>birth</b> <b>timing</b> in women was 34 %; and the remaining variance (66 %) was caused by individual-specific environmental factors. Conclusion: Our data implicate a significant contribution of maternal but not paternal genetic influences on <b>birth</b> <b>timing.</b> © 2008 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Objective: While {{multiple}} {{lines of}} evidence suggest {{the importance of}} genetic contributors to risk of preterm birth, {{the nature of the}} genetic component has not been identified. We perform segregation analyses to identify the best fitting genetic model for gestational age, a quantitative proxy for preterm birth. Methods: Because either mother or infant can be considered the proband from a preterm delivery and there is evidence to suggest that genetic factors in either one or both may influence the trait, we performed segregation analysis for gestational age either attributed to the infant (infant's gestational age), or the mother (by averaging the gestational ages at which her children were delivered), using 96 multiplex preterm families. Results: These data lend further support to a genetic component contributing to <b>birth</b> <b>timing</b> since sporadic (i. e. no familial resemblance) and nontransmission (i. e. environmental factors alone contribute to gestational age) models are strongly rejected. Analyses of gestational age attributed to the infant support a model in which mother's genome and/or maternally-inherited genes acting in the fetus are largely responsible for <b>birth</b> <b>timing,</b> with a smaller contribution from the paternally-inherited alleles in the fetal genome. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that genetic influences on <b>birth</b> <b>timing</b> are important and likely complex. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|E
40|$|Births {{postponement}} {{is a key}} {{demographic trend}} of the last decades. To examine its social desirability, we study how utilitarian criteria rank histories equal on all dimensions except {{the age at which}} individuals give birth to their children. We develop a T-period dynamic overlapping generations economy with a fixed living space, where individual welfare is increasing in the available space per head, and where agents have children in one out of two fertility periods. When comparing finite histories with an equal total number of life-periods, classical, average and critical-level utilitarian criteria select the same fertility timing, i. e. the one leading to the most smoothed population path. When comparing infinite histories with stationary population sizes, utilitarian criteria may select different <b>birth</b> <b>timings,</b> depending on individual utility functions. Those results are compared with the ones obtained when agents value coexistence time with their descendants. Finally, we identify conditions under which a shift from an early births regime to a late birthsregime is socially desirable...|$|R
40|$|During pre-rutting and rutting period, spacing {{behaviour}} of {{male and}} female roe deer Capreolus capreolus (Linnaeus, 1758) was studied in a wooded and mountainous habitat, in the Casentinesi Forest National Park, Italy. Data were collected using radio-tracking techniques from March to August 1997. Bimonthly and monthly home ranges and bimonthly home range overlaps of both sexes were analysed. Variations in bimonthly home range sizes did not show significant differences between sexes during pre-rutting and rutting period. Different social factors seemed to influence the ranging behaviour of both sexes in this mountainous habitat. Male use of space varied in relation to the age classes of animals, especially during the pre-rutting period, when yearlings were not able to establish a territory. Female ranging movements were linked to the <b>births</b> <b>timing</b> and to two different spacing strategies during the rutting period. Home ranges sizes of females were significantly lower than those of males in May and in July. Significant changes in home range sizes were also found between prime age males and both roaming and stationary females...|$|R
40|$|Background : Support from {{families}} can reduce costs of reproduction and may therefore {{be associated with}} higher fertility for men and women. Family supportiveness, however, varies both between families - some families are more supportive than others - and within families over time - as the needs of recipients and the abilities of support givers change. Distinguishing the effects of time-invariant between-family supportiveness and time-varying within-family supportiveness on fertility can help contribute {{to an understanding of}} how family support influences fertility. Objective : We distinguish 'between' and 'within' families for several types of support shared between parents and adult children and test whether between- and within-family variation in support associates with <b>birth</b> <b>timings.</b> Methods : We use seven years of annually collected LISS panel data from the Netherlands on 2, 288 reproductive-aged men and women to investigate the timing of first and subsequent births. Results : We find between-family support is more often associated with fertility than is within-family support, particularly for first births and for women. Emotional support is generally associated with earlier first births for both men and women, while results for financial and reciprocal emotional support are mixed. There is some indication that the latter kind of support positively predicts births for men and negatively for women. Conclusions : Our results suggest that feeling supported may be more important than actual support in reproductive decision-making in this high-income setting. Contribution : We apply a method novel to human demography to address both a conceptual and methodological issue in studies of families and fertility...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} maternity leave legislation on first <b>birth</b> <b>timing</b> in Great Britain. When maternity leave was introduced in Great Britain in 1976, the eligibility requirement for full-time employees {{was to have been}} working for the same employer for at least 2 years. Using data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), this paper examines whether women postponed first birth in accordance with tenure requirements for maternity leave. Higher transition rates to first birth are found for those who had acquired enough employer tenure to qualify for maternity leave than for those who did not yet qualify. However, the causal role of maternity leave legislation for first <b>birth</b> <b>timing</b> is uncertain, since transition rates to first birth began to diverge by employer tenure even before 1976. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{potential advantages}} in <b>birth</b> <b>timing</b> for mountain lion (Puma concolor) cubs. We examined cub body mass, survival, {{and age of}} natal dispersal in relation to specific timing of birth. We also investigated the role of maternal age relative to timing of births. We captured mountain lion cubs while in the natal den to determine birth date, which allowed for precise estimates of the population birth pulse and age of natal dispersal. A birth pulse occurred during June-August. Body mass of cubs was related to litter size and timing of birth; heaviest cubs occurred in litters of 2, and those born after 1 July. Cubs born within pulse months exhibited similar survival to those born out of the pulse. We found that cubs born April-June dispersed at younger ages than those born after 1 July. There was less variation in <b>birth</b> <b>timing</b> for 1 (st) litters of females than older females.

40|$|Different neurons and glial {{cells in}} the Drosophila {{olfactory}} circuitry have distinct functions in olfaction. The mechanisms to generate most of diverse neurons and glial {{cells in the}} olfactory circuitry remain unclear due to the incomprehensive study of cell lineages. To facilitate the analyses of cell lineages and neural diversity, two independent binary transcription systems were introduced into Drosophila to drive two different transgenes in different cells. A technique called ‘dual-expression-control MARCM’ (mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker) was created by incorporating a GAL 80 -suppresible transcription factor LexA::GAD (GAL 4 activation domain) into the MARCM. This technique allows the induction of UAS- and lexAop- transgenes in different patterns among the GAL 80 -minus cells. Dual-expression-control MARCM with a ubiquitous driver tubP-LexA::GAD and various subtype-specific GAL 4 s which express in antennal lobe neurons (ALNs) allowed us to characterize diverse ALNs and their lineage relationships. Genetic studies showed that ALN cell fates are determined by spatial identities rooted in their precursor cells and temporal identities based on their <b>birth</b> <b>timings</b> within the lineage, and then finalized through cell-cell interactions mediated by Notch signaling. Glial cell lineage analyses by MARCM and dual-expression-control MARCM show that diverse post-embryonic born glial cells are lineage specified and independent of neuronal lineage. Specified glial lineages expand their glial population by symmetrical division and do not further diversify glial cells. Construction of a GAL 4 -insensitive transcription factor LexA::VP 16 (VP 16 acidic activation domain) allows the independent induction of lexAop transgenes in the entire mushroom body (MB) and labeling of individual MB neurons by MARCM in the same organism. A computer algorithm is developed to perform morphometric analysis to assist the study of MB neuron diversity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the impact of childbearing history on later-life mortality for ever-married men and women using historical micro-level data of high quality for southern Sweden. The analysis uses a Cox proportional hazards model, estimating the effects on old-age mortality of number of <b>births</b> and <b>timing</b> of first and last births. By studying the effects of previous childbearing on mortality by sex and social status, we also gain important insights into the mechanisms relating childbearing to mortality in old age. The results show that number of children ever born had a statistically significant negative impact on longevity after age 50 for females but not for mates. Analysis by social group shows that only landless women experienced higher mortality from having more children, which seems to indicate that the main explanations {{are to be found in}} social or economic conditions specific to females, rather than in the strictly biological or physiological effects of childbearing...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that the effect of age at first birth on mental health for women is curvilinear, with first births at both young (age 20 and younger) and older ages (after age 30) being positively associated with psychological distress. Scholars have theorized that accumulated disadvantages and physical health problems associated with age at first birth explain this pattern, although empirical support for these explanations has varied. Using data from the US National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, this study provides evidence of an alternative explanation for this curvilinear relationship through its focus on: 1) the relationship between deviations from expected age at first birth and women's actual age at first birth, and 2) the effect deviations from expected age at first birth have on mental health. Results indicate that deviating from their expected age at first birth results in higher levels of depressive symptoms for women in midlife who transition into parenthood both earlier and later than expected. These deviations from expected <b>birth</b> <b>timing</b> account for the upward trend in depressive symptoms at older ages of first birth, but explain only a small amount of the higher levels of depressive symptoms at younger ages.

The paper thus argues that prior and posterior spacing between consecutive siblings are important measures of the intensity of competition among siblings for limited parental resources. While the available estimates of child mortality tend to ignore this simultaneity bias, we use a correlated recursive model of prior and posterior spacing and child mortality to correct it. There is evidence that uncorrected estimates underestimate the effects of prior and posterior spacing on child mortality...|$|E

40|$|This {{overview}} of Austrian fertility trends and patterns looks {{first at the}} basic trends in {{the total number of}} births by birth order and the main indicators of fertility, including estimates of parity distribution among selected birth cohorts of women. The subsequent sections review the trends in nonmarital childbearing, multiple <b>births,</b> fertility <b>timing,</b> and age-specific patterns of fertility. The final section features period and cohort indicators of parity progression. It looks in particular at the progression to first birth and at period progression rates to second and third birth among women past age 30. This analysis is further complemented by the parity progression indicators based on the duration since the previous birth. The period analysed here is not strictly defined and depends to some extent on data availability. Most of the figures and tables focus on the period and cohort fertility realised between 1960 and 2004 and, due to data limitations, a number of parity-specific indicators depict only the trends in the last two decades...|$|R
40|$|The annual {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} most seal species {{is characterized by}} a tight synchrony of <b>births.</b> Typically, <b>timing</b> of <b>birth</b> shows little inter-annual variation. Here, however we show that harbour seals Phoca vitulina from the Wadden Sea (southeast North Sea) have shortened their yearly cycle, moving parturition to earlier dates since the early 1970 s. Between 1974 and 2009, the birth date of harbour seals shifted on average by - 0. 71 d yr- 1, three and a half weeks (25 days) earlier, in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. Pup counts available for other parts of the Wadden Sea were analysed, showing a similar shift. To elucidate potential mechanism(s) for this shift in pupping phenology, possible changes in population demography, changes in maternal life-history traits and variations in environmental conditions were examined. It was deduced that the most likely mechanism was a shortening of embryonic diapause. We hypothesize that this could have been facilitated by an improved forage base, e. g. increase of small fishes, attributable to overfishing of large predator fishes and size-selective fisheries...|$|R

At this date, however, the Western church tended to place the arrival of the Magi later, though certainly before the Flight to Egypt and the Massacre of the Innocents. Some departure from chronology to enable thematic or typological connections to be emphasised is a common feature of medieval picture cycles.|$|R

Pre-term birth (PTB), a major complication of pregnancy, {{is a leading}} cause of infant mortality worldwide. A major obstacle in addressing PTB is that the mechanisms controlling parturition and <b>birth</b> <b>timing</b> remain poorly understood. Integrative approaches that overlay datasets derived from comparative genomics with function-derived ones have potential to advance our understanding of the genetics of <b>birth</b> <b>timing,</b> and thus provide insights into the genes that may contribute to PTB. We intersected data from fast evolving coding and non-coding gene regions in the human and primate lineage with data from genes expressed in the placenta, from genes that show enriched expression only in the placenta, as well as from genes that are differentially expressed in four distinct PTB clinical subtypes. A large fraction of genes that are expressed in placenta, and differentially expressed in PTB clinical subtypes (23 - 34 %) are fast evolving, and are associated with functions that include adhesion neurodevelopmental and immune processes. Functional categories of genes that express fast evolution in coding regions differ from those linked to fast evolution in non-coding regions. Finally, there is a surprising lack of overlap between fast evolving genes that are differentially expressed in four PTB clinical subtypes. Integrative approaches, especially those that incorporate evolutionary perspectives, can be successful in identifying potential genetic contributions to complex genetic diseases, such as PTB...|$|E

To identify ecologically relevant critical day lengths and to test {{the extent to which}} naturally changing day lengths synchronize important developmental events, we monitored 9 cohorts of male Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus), born every two weeks from 4 weeks before to 12 weeks after the summer solstice in a simulated natural photoperiod (SNP).

Hamsters born 8 or more weeks after the solstice failed to undergo early testicular development. The transition to delayed development occurred at long day lengths, which induce early puberty when presented as static photoperiods.

Methods: This observational study collected longitudinal weight measurements set in a hospital labour ward. A total of 26 mothers at term and their singleton babies participated in the study. In this reanalysis, the velocity of weight change over the first minutes of life determined by functional data analysis was estimated. Results: We found that the flow velocity in the umbilical cord was on average 0 at 125 s after placing the baby on the scales, which was typically 140 s after birth.

40|$|This {{research}} examines {{factors associated}} with the timing and risk of first and second births in Canada, focusing primarily {{on the role of}} women 2 ̆ 7 s educational attainment. A major theme is that fundamental changes in recent years, not only in the duration of education, but also in the content and social significance of formal schooling, have resulted in changes in the strength and nature of the basic association across successive birth cohorts of women. The Accelerated Failure Time Model (AFT) is applied to data from the 1984 Canadian Fertility Survey (CFS) in order to determine how educational attainment, estimated as closely as possible to the dates of both first and second births, influences the timing of childbearing and whether the importance of this variable varies according to birth cohorts. Two parallel multivariate models are estimated, measuring women 2 ̆ 7 s education with both four and three categories or levels, in order to examine possible changes over time in the significance of certain thresholds of attainment. The results suggest that, among a number of variables useful for distinguishing different levels of risk, educational attainment is an important predictor of <b>birth</b> <b>timing.</b> Its effects, however, are largely dependent on birth order and also on membership in a particular birth cohort to some extent. Patterns of influence also differ between the models using education with three and four categories, indicating shifts over time in the significance for fertility behavior of a given duration (or quantity) of formal schooling. In general, higher education is seen to exert a positive or delaying influence on <b>birth</b> <b>timing</b> (or a reduction in risk) for women of most age groups and birth orders, although its statistical significance is confined mostly to predicting the first birth event. As expected, certain cohort variations are also evident, most notably in the case of first birth, where the overall pattern appears to involve a relative increase across cohorts in the delaying or decelerating effect of higher educational attainment on <b>birth</b> <b>timing.</b> This general trend may be interpreted as resulting from changes in the content and socioeconomic significance of formal schooling {{over the past few decades}} which have worked to increase the delaying impact of educational achievement on women 2 ̆ 7 s timing of births.

40|$|Since the 1960 s {{there has}} been a {{dramatic}} drop in birth rates across Europe, and fertility below replacement levels has captured the attention of researchers, policymakers, and society at large. In research this is reflected by analysis on possible reasons for the fertility decline, including studies of fertility intentions and subsequent outcomes. Fertility intentions are an essential factor to understand changing fertility rates at macro level as well as individual family transitions. Studies suggest that not all fertility intentions are realized (Schoen et al. 1999; Voas 2003) and expected number of children is generally higher than completed number of children (Noack & Østby 2000). One of the most prominent social psychological models used to explain or predict behaviors is the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). According to this theory the intention is not only a direct pre-condition to the behavior, but actually mediates between a set of explanatory factors and the possible outcome (Ajzen 2005). To understand the gap between expressed intentions and actual <b>births</b> the <b>timing</b> of fertility intentions seems relevant.

40|$|One {{grey area}} in the miracle of <b>birth</b> is the <b>timing</b> of when an {{umbilical}} cord is clamped. Currently there is not agreement among obstetricians, family practice medical doctors, midwives, neonatologists, neonatal nurse practitioners and nurses as to {{the best time to}} clamp the umbilical cord following the delivery of a newborn baby. A lot of buzz regarding delayed cord clamping is currently heard in the fetal-maternal areas and newborn intensive care units of hospitals. This research examines and confirms the best practices of umbilical cord clamping, identifies barriers that may delay the adoption of the best practices, and finally recommends an implementation model to facilitate the best practices in standardized care. A literature review, a survey, and interviews compose the methodology of this research. In the literature review, delayed umbilical cord clamping versus immediate umbilical cord clamping was found beneficial to the late preterm and full-term infants, without placing the mother at risk during the postpartum period. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the construction of}} fertility intentions in contemporary Bulgaria and Hungary. It presents empirical analyses of four types of fertility intentions: whether to have or {{not to have a}} first or a second child and if yes, whether to have this child within the next two years or later. Both countries have recently experienced drastic societal transformations. Based on comparative survey data for women we find that that explanatory factors of fertility intentions differ significantly by order of an intended <b>birth</b> and its <b>timing.</b> We attribute particular emphasis to social anomie and social capital as important factors in shaping fertility intentions and in <b>timing</b> a desired <b>birth.</b> Moreover, economic factors are important determinants in Bulgaria, while ideational and demographic factors are significant in both countries. The findings suggest the necessity of explicitly taking into account birth order and the timing of a desired birth in large-scale demographic surveys and the importance of anomie and social capital in recent fertility choices in Central and Eastern Europe...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to {{maternal}} anxiety predicts offspring brain development. However, because children’s {{brains are}} commonly assessed years after <b>birth,</b> the <b>timing</b> of such maternal influences in humans is unclear. This study aimed {{to examine the}} consequences of antenatal and postnatal exposure to maternal anxiety upon early infant development of the hippocampus, a key structure for stress regulation. A total of 175 neonates underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at birth and among them 35 had repeated scans at 6 months of age. Maternal anxiety was assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at week 26 of pregnancy and 3 months after delivery. Regression analyses showed that antenatal maternal anxiety did not influence bilateral hippocampal volume at birth. However, children of mothers reporting increased anxiety during pregnancy showed slower growth of {{both the left and}} right hippocampus over the first 6 months of life. This effect of antenatal maternal anxiety upon right hippocampal growth became statistically stronger when controlling for postnatal maternal anxiety. Furthermore, a strong positive association between postnatal maternal anxiety and right hippocampal growth was detected, whereas a strong negative association between postnatal maternal anxiety and the left hippocampal volume at 6 months of life was found. Hence, the postnatal growth of bilateral hippocampi shows distinct responses to postnatal maternal anxiety. The size of the left hippocampus during early development is likely to reflect the influence of the exposure to perinatal maternal anxiety, whereas right hippocampal growth is constrained by antenatal maternal anxiety, but enhanced in response to increased postnatal maternal anxiety...|$|R
