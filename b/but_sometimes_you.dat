500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] {{talks about}} a scorned lover rediscovering their inner strength, with Madonna [...] "shooting a few poison arrows {{into the heart of}} some dude who's done her wrong," [...] as noted by Rolling Stone Rob Sheffield. During the song, she {{repeatedly}} labels an ex's bad behavior as [...] "bullshit" [...] and tells him, [...] "fuck you". In another part, she mocks, [...] "When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied." [...] In the chorus, she sings: [...] "It might sound like I’m an unapologetic bitch / <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> know I gotta call I like it is." [...] The song was allegedly written about Madonna's ex-boyfriend Brahim Zaibat. She told Rolling Stone that the song [...] "it's like, fuck you, I'm going to have fun. You think you're going to ruin my life and you think that it's over for me, but guess what? It's not. Life goes on." [...] While commenting to Billboard over the usage of the word [...] "bitch" [...] numerous times in two songs from the album, Madonna explained: ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, Jackson's brother Michael {{died at age}} fifty. She spoke {{publicly}} {{concerning his}} death at the 2009 BET Awards, stating [...] "I'd just like to say, to you, Michael is an icon, to us, Michael is family. And he will forever live {{in all of our}} hearts. On behalf of my family and myself, thank you for all of your love, thank you for all of your support. We miss him so much." [...] In an interview, she revealed she had first learned of his death while filming Why Did I Get Married Too?. Amidst mourning with her family, she focused on work to deal with the grief, avoiding any news coverage of her sibling's death. She commented, [...] "it's still important to face reality, and not that I'm running, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> just need to get away for a second." [...] During this time, she ended her seven-year relationship with Jermaine Dupri. Several months later, Jackson performed a tribute to Michael at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, performing their duet [...] "Scream". MTV stated [...] "there was no one better than Janet to anchor it and send a really powerful message." [...] The performance was lauded by critics, with Entertainment Weekly affirming the rendition [...] "as energetic as it was heartfelt".|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. While analyzing [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] and [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna", Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that [...] "their titles suggesting vulgarity, their execution flinty and knowing," [...] and also picked [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] {{as one of}} the album's highlights. Kitty Empire of The Guardian noted that the songs on Rebel Heart with the word [...] "bitch" [...] in the title [...] "bode well", expressing that [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] is even better than [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna", where [...] "Diplo lays Madonna down over some dancehall. Santigold was doing similar things in ’08, but the method remains sound." [...] Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club also noticed that it [...] "resembles watered-down Santigold." [...] Amy Pettifer of The Quietus applauded the line, [...] "you never really knew how much you loved me till you lost me", calling it [...] "the killer nugget of this track," [...] which she labelled [...] "icked good," [...] while Time's Jamieson Cox thought that it was [...] "fun to hear Madonna deliver a line like, 'It might sound like I’m an unapologetic bitch / <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> know I gotta call I like it is' because she has three’ decades worth of unapologetic bitchiness in her back pocket. It’s an easy score, sure, but it’s effective." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it [...] "brilliant", while Lee DeVito [...] of Metro Times called it [...] "one of the more enjoyable tracks" [...] on the album.|$|E

500|$|Rebel Heart {{opens with}} the song [...] "Living for Love". Composed in the house genre, it begins with Madonna singing over a [...] "regal" [...] piano line, {{eventually}} joined by percussion. Although a breakup song, [...] "Living for Love" [...] talks about being triumphant and hopeful. According to Dean Piper of The Daily Telegraph, the song has [...] "some classic Madonna traits: religious references, a gospel choir, 90s piano beats and a whirling bass". It was compared to her 1989 singles, [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Express Yourself" [...] by Jason Lipshutz of Billboard. The second track, [...] "Devil Pray", was inspired by how one could be enticed to partake of narcotics to achieve {{a higher level of}} consciousness and connect to God. Lyrically it asks for salvation from a variety of drug abuses, making allusions to Saint Mary and Lucifer, as well as the pain of healing from drug abuse. Produced by Madonna with Falk, Avicii, DJ Dahi, and Blood Diamonds, [...] "Devil Pray" [...] starts with gentle guitar sounds which build up to an electropop production, accompanied by a house beat. [...] "Ghosttown" [...] talks about civilizations ending and the world encountering an armageddon, but humans seeing hope amid the destruction. Written with Jason Evigan, Evan Bogart, and Sean Douglas, it is a power ballad song, which Madonna sings in [...] "piercing" [...] and [...] "warm" [...] vocals like those of Karen Carpenter's, and the production is comparable to her 1986 single, [...] "Live to Tell". According to Douglas, [...] "Ghosttown" [...] was written in three days, after Madonna personally requested studio time with him and the other songwriters. The fourth track, [...] "Unapologetic Bitch", has reggae, dancehall, and dubstep influences, and is a ska song where Madonna speaks negatively about a break-up and her lover, in lyrics such as: [...] "It might sound like I'm an Unapologetic Bitch <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> have to call it like it is". Madonna explained that the song is about having fun irrespective of the situation one is in.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2013, Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg {{said after}} meeting with his Georgian {{counterpart}} Maia Panjikidze that Russia respected only a state [...] "that is larger" [...] and therefore the Czech Republic could not mediate between Russia and Georgia. As for Georgia’s future {{with regard to the}} occupied territories, the Czech Foreign Minister said Georgia should maintain contacts with them. [...] "It is difficult when your territories are occupied, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> have to wait for years, even decades before the window of possibilities will be opened for you. I do not know when that time will come, but it will necessarily come", he said.|$|E
2500|$|Conference {{attendance}} gets {{much attention}} on Gerbic's bi-weekly segments on the Skeptic Society's Skepticality podcast. She stresses {{how important it}} is for skeptics to attend, and if there aren't conferences nearby, then to create a conference, be it a SkeptiCamp or a Skeptics in the Pub event. She insists that conference attendance is the first step towards activism. [...] "What I do know is that the one-on-one contact recharges our batteries. People like Harriet A. Hall (Skepdoc), Lindsay Beyerstein (co-host of Point of Inquiry), and myself came from CSI’s Skeptic's Toolbox. We weren't primarily authors or lecturers, just people with a passion for the skeptical movement who decided it was our turn to step up. You can’t buy that fire, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> might have to kick the embers to keep us (and others) out there fighting what seems to be an insurmountable world of woo.

2500|$|Roger Sargent (a {{close friend}} and {{photographer}} of the band) described their relationship as like [...] "first love, and all the jealousy and obsessiveness that comes with that" [...] - adding [...] "I think there's, y'know, obsession and jealousy on both of their sides. They bitch about each other to each other or to other people. They have a bond, intellectually and spiritually, like nothing I've ever seen ... <b>but</b> <b>sometimes,</b> <b>you</b> know, you just think, God, why don't you just get a room?!" [...] In the same interview, a Radio One documentary, upon being asked just how close their relationship was, Doherty responded [...] "I love him. Wouldn't go, um - certainly not on Radio 1 - go into too much detail, but... we had lots of wonderful times together, yeah." [...] Barât, when questioned similarly, steadfastly denied that the relationship had involved anything [...] "physical". Barât has insisted that [...] "people are really into conjecture" [...] and has frequently denied having {{a sexual relationship with}} Doherty. However, in a 2011 interview when asked if the two had ever had a physical relationship he replied [...] "There have been moments in our relationship where physicality has ensued." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 75. Finally, {{you must}} {{remember}} that great obscurity has been brought upon the truth in this matter by the want of integrity and simplicity in our modern life. I mean integrity in the Latin sense, wholeness. Everything is broken up, and mingled in confusion, both in our habits and thoughts; besides being in great part imitative: so that you not only cannot tell what a man is, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> cannot tell whether he is, at all!--whether you have indeed {{to do with a}} spirit, or only with an echo. And thus the same inconsistencies appear now, between the work of artists of merit and their personal characters, as those which you find continually disappointing expectation in the lives of men of modern literary power; the same conditions of society having obscured or misdirected the best qualities of the imagination, both in our literature and art. Thus there is no serious question with any of us as to the personal character of Dante and Giotto, of Shakespeare and Holbein; but we pause timidly in the attempt to analyse the moral laws of the art skill in recent poets, novelists, and painters.|$|E
