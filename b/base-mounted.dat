40|$|This paper {{presents}} a 2 -degree-of-freedom (DOF) joint with coupled variable output stiffness that {{makes use of}} three actuators, i. e., two for the 2 -D joint motions {{and one for the}} joint stiffness adjustment. By <b>base-mounting</b> the actuators and the variable stiffness module that contains the passive elastic elements, the design is compact and has low actuated inertia.

50|$|The APHE shell {{itself was}} of the 1890s Hotchkiss naval type {{consisting}} of a hard-nosed forged-steel projectile with a <b>base-mounted</b> inertial deceleration shock-delay fuse with a stable explosive filler, most likely Picric Acid.

50|$|This mutual {{stiffening}} also permits simple construction: Stewart platform hexapods chains use {{prismatic joint}} linear actuators between any-axis universal ball joints. The ball joints are passive: simply free to move, without actuators or brakes; their position is constrained solely {{by the other}} chains. Delta robots have <b>base-mounted</b> rotary actuators that move a light, stiff, parallelogram arm. The effector is mounted between the tips of three of these arms and again, it may be mounted with simple ball-joints. Static representation of a parallel robot is often akin {{to that of a}} pin-jointed truss: the links and their actuators feel only tension or compression, without any bending or torque, which again reduces the effects of any flexibility to off-axis forces.|$|E
50|$|After World War II, FFW {{configurations}} {{were produced}} for the Jeep, Austin Champ and Land Rover. In these smaller vehicles, {{it was necessary}} to construct racking to hold the sets and often to remove the rear seats. Owing to the small capacity of the Jeep and early Landrover charging systems, the 300W charging set was still required, although there was little space for it and was sometimes even mounted between the front seats. The Austin Champ. however, was built in a dedicated FFW version from 1954 and was provided with dedicated radio supply connections and a high-output generator for the role. Single-set installations were produced for the Jeep during World War II The introduction of the post-war and smaller C42 & C45 sets allowed a dual-set installation, even in these small 5cwt or ¼-ton vehicles. Whip aerials for the VHF set(s) were installed on the front wings of these vehicles, together with their <b>base-mounted</b> Aerial Tuning Units to obtain maximum separation from any HF antenna. This practice became a distinctive feature of British Army vehicles in later years.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} on using a combo keyboard amp {{as a small}} PA system. First, {{it is hard to}} elevate a keyboard amp's speaker the way most PA speakers can be raised up, using PA system speaker stands with a pole onto which most small- to mid-sized PA speaker enclosures can be mounted using their <b>base-mounted</b> metal socket (a hole in a metal plate). Elevating a PA speaker above the audience helps to ensure that the sound is dispersed to the whole audience; if a combo keyboard amp is used as a small PA, the keyboard amp is typically placed on the floor or raised a bit by placing it on a table. In this scenario, the sound produced by the keyboard amp would be absorbed by the first several rows of audience members, and people {{in the back of the}} venue might not be able to hear the performance. Second, most small, low-wattage keyboard amps do not produce enough volume to clearly project the lead vocals into the venue so that they are at the [...] "front of the mix", a sound preferred in many pop genres. For example, whereas a small PA system for a coffeehouse would typically have 100 watts, a small keyboard combo amp may only be rated at 20 watts. Third, while the vast majority of small PA systems come with two speaker cabinets, most combo keyboard amps have a single speaker cabinet. With two speaker cabinets, even if both are pointing straight out at the audience, this provides better coverage of the room; moreover, the two speaker cabinets can be angled outwards a bit, increasing the arc of coverage better for wide rooms.|$|E
50|$|After the war the {{business}} was revived and by 1946 a limited range of steam toys was being made - the SE1, SE2, Minor 1 and tools. The pre-war SE3 and SE4 were dropped along with the short-lived twin cylinder Minor 2. Apart from the Minor 1 (now usually called MM1), the engines made in immediate post-war period had <b>base-mounted</b> chimneys. The boiler mounted chimney soon returned though, during 1946. In all other respects the engines {{were the same as}} before the war. The SE1 and SE2 were only produced in this form for a few months; post war rationing meant that it was harder to replace materials used in production and so the SE1 and SE2 changed back to the locomotive style chimney. Apart from colour changes, the MM1 continued almost unchanged. Until 1948, the tools still used flat bases and cast iron bodies. By 1948 the SE range had received its first real update. Mamod branded brass engine frames and hot-stamped brass flywheels were introduced and the SE1 and SE2 received a regulator as well. Also introduced was the new Minor 2 (MM2). This had a single cylinder engine unit and was a larger version of the MM1. All engines continued to use wick burners with either 1, 2 or 3 wick tubes. By 1949, with the move to Camden Street, the firm had acquired a pressing facility and the expensive brass engine frames were replaced with pressed steel ones. The design was similar to those found on some Marklin engines. The boilers on the SE1 and SE2 now had a little superheating. The SE2 retained its regulator but the SE1 lost its. The MM1 engine became the first engine in the range to have a raised pressed base. The range remained in this form until 1953, when with the introduction of cheaper Mazak as a material, the brass flywheels were gradually replaced. This is typical of the Malins Engineers approach in ensuring that the models were always updated and changed to keep the price point as competitive as possible. In that immediate post-war period there were many other manufacturers making steam toys, such as Plane Products, Cyldon, SEL, Luton Bowman and Burnac.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Manipulators {{are often}} {{required}} to perform small amplitude, slow motions with very high precision. For hydraulic manipulators these fine motions are difficult to execute due to high nonlinear joint friction found in these systems.

40|$|The laser {{differential}} interferometer {{is a high}} sensitivity (λ/ 13, 000 minimum detectable wavelength shift), large bandwidth (6 MHz), nonintrusive instrument ideal for low-density optical flow diagnostics. Up to one half wavelength shifts are possible with active phase compensation. With feedback control, a phase modulator stabilizes the system within the linear range. Calibrated receptivity experiments are performed in a Mach 4 quiet-flow Ludwieg tube. Laser-generated thermal spots are used as repeatable, controlled perturbations to the subsonic region behind the bow shock of both a hemispherical nose and a forward-facing cavity. Thermal spot amplitudes, spatial characteristics, and repeatability are measured. Both on-axis and off axis surveys of the subsonic region indicate damped oscillations with both blunt nose configurations. With the forward-facing cavity, a characteristic frequency based on the cavity geometry is detected. The results from both configurations correlate with nose-mounted and cavity <b>base-mounted</b> pressure transducer measurements, and thus remove frequency ambiguity from the pressure transducer experiments. High speed synchronous schlieren images show the thermal spot evolution and impingement at the hemispherical nose.

In Part 1 the flow regimes on a caret wing are discussed with particular emphasis placed on the occurrence of 'strong' oblique shocks. Results are presented which demonstrate that when viewed in direction normal to the leading edge, shocks of both the 'weak' and the 'strong' families can be said to exist. An experiment designed to produce a single strong shock by means of a caret wingýof large anhedral, instead gave rise to a complex multiple shock pattern which could not be adequately explained by exact inviscid theory.

40|$|A {{new class}} of six-degree-of-freedom (six-DOF) {{parallel}} minimanipulators is introduced. The minimanipulators are designed to provide high resolution and high stiffness in fine- manipulation operations. Two-DOF planar mechanisms (e. g., five- bar linkages, pantographs) and inextensible limbs are used to improve positional resolution and stiffness of the minimanipulators. The two-DOF mechanisms serve as drivers for the minimanipulators. The minimanipulators require only three inextensible limbs and unlike most of the six-limbed parallel manipulators, their direct kinematics {{can be reduced to}} solving a polynomial in a single variable. All of the minimanipulator actuators are <b>base-mounted.</b> As a result, higher payload capacity, smaller actuator sizes, and lower power dissipation can be obtained. Inverse kinematics of the minimanipulators has been reduced to solving three decoupled quadratic equations, each of which contains only one unknown. Kinematic inversion is used to reduce the direct kinematics of the minimanipulator to an eighth- degree polynomial in the square of a single variable. Hence, the maximum number of assembly configurations for the minimanipulator is sixteen. It is proved that the sixteen solutions are eight pairs of reflected configurations with respect to the plane passing through the lower ends of the three limbs. The Jacobian and stiffness matrices of two types of minimanipulators are derived. It is shown that, at a central configuration, the stiffness matrix of the first type minimanipulator (driven by bidirectional linear stepper motors) can be decoupled, if proper design parameters are chosen. It is also shown that the stiffness of the minimanipulators is higher than that of the Stewart platform. Guidelines for obtaining large stiffness values and for designing the drivers of the second type minimanipulator (simplified five-bar linkages) are established. An algorithm is developed to determine the workspace of the minimanipulators. Given any orientation for the output link, three-dimensional representation of the workspace is obtained. Guidelines for avoiding discontinuities inside of the workspace are established. Necessary and sufficient conditions for both inverse and direct kinematics singularities of the minimanipulators are obtained. Guidelines for avoiding direct kinematics singularities, which occur within the minimanipulator workspace, are established...|$|E
