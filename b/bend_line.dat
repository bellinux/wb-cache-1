The two standard types of finite elements have been used: shell and solid elements. All calculations have been implemented in a commercial finite element software, Abaqus. The model for precise springback prediction has been implemented and the accuracy in function of the number of elements through the thickness - has been analyzed.

40|$|Abstract. When {{sheets of}} {{high-strength}} (HS) and ultra-high-strength (UHS) steels are bent by a press brake the process suffers from large bending forces, considerable springback, and eventual cracks. Additionally, some unpredictable effects, such as lost contact to the punch, caused by strain hardening may occur producing a bend with erroneous radii. The strain hardening of the <b>bending</b> <b>line</b> may make further processes, such as forming or welding, more complex. One solution {{to these problems}} is to anneal the <b>bending</b> <b>line</b> with a laser in advance. Of course, {{it is also possible}} to utilise other types of heat sources, but the laser can offer the most precisely controlled heat treatment. The proper process parameters depend on the material, and it has been noticed that inadequate process parameters may harden the material instead of annealing. In this work some experiments on bending sheet metal samples of HS or UHS steel with previously laser-annealed <b>bending</b> <b>lines</b> have been carried out and the outcome analysed. The results show that the annealing produces better bending results compared to the conventional procedure. This includes lower springback, less hardening in the <b>bending</b> <b>line</b> and more precise geometry of the bend. It can be even suggested that proper annealing with strain hardening in bending will produce the original material structure. Obviously, more theoretical and experimental work is required to optimise the process parameters including the laser power and speed for each pair of material strength and thickness...|$|R

Build bridges with pillars in the middle of meandering river will caused the alteration of river morphology. This study are examines the effect of the presence of bridge pillars at the channel bends that lead in transformation of the water, alteration of water velocity, as well as the morphology of the river bed.

40|$|The {{formation}} of deformation texture {{is an important}} material characteristic which influences {{the behavior of a}} material. A textured material usually exhibits certain levels of anisotropy {{which may or may not}} be desirable from a practical point of view. During a forming process, strip is progressively bent into complex shapes by passing it through a series of driven rolls or dies. Normally, punches and dies are designed so that successive stages in the forming of the part are carried out in the same die on each stroke of the press in a progressive forming method. However, total automation and the improvement of productivity and quality of the products is frustrated by the variability of the physical and mechanical properties of material feed stock. The directionalities of properties produced by rolling and other primary working processes can have important consequences on the fabricability of the material. For example, sometimes bending is more difficult when the <b>bend</b> <b>line</b> is parallel to the rolling direction than when the bend is made perpendicular to the rolling direction...|$|E

Cheng and Yao (2001) found that the forced cooling can significantly reduce the total forming time in a multi-pass laser bending process. They also found that the forced air cooling does not have any harmful effect on micro-structural and mechanical properties of the workpiece. Shen et al. (2011) studied the effect of forced cooling on laser bending of steel plates using finite element based numerical simulations. The forced cooling was applied either on top or bottom or on both the surfaces. It was moving simultaneously with laser beam by an offset of about one second. The forced cooling did not {{have a significant effect on}} the bend angle and edge effect. Chen et al. (2004) observed that in a curvilinear laser bending, the deformation occurs on one side of the laser scanning path along which the rigid constraint is lower. Zhang et al. (2007) showed that the peak temperature at the scanning surface and warping increases with the increase in scanning path curvature. Kant and Joshi (2014) observed that the worksheet does not bend over the laser scanning path in the curvilinear laser bending process.

For these reasons, we measured the properties of wireless radio signal with steel pipes and ceramic pipes and we developed a practical wireless radio communication system. On the other hand, the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur has researched a rotating probe using piezo element for inspecting the inside of pipes with a touch sensor system. This time, we developed and tested a new inspection robot that had integrated both the inspection system using wireless radio communication and image transmission developed by Waseda University and the inspection system using the rotating probe developed by the Indian Institute of Technology.

Bending and bend-stretching characteristics and limit strain of monolithic AA 2024 and laminated tri-layer Alclad 2024 aluminum sheet materials are studied by modeling and experimentation. A computationally efficient analytical model based on advanced bending theory is developed for the laminated sheet materials and utilized to predict the bending characteristics of the above sheet materials. The effects of cladding thickness ratio on the bending characteristics of laminated sheet are compared with the monolithic constituent. Also, predictions from the above analytical bending model are compared with 2 D and 3 D FE-based bending models. In addition, bend-stretching experiments are conducted using a specialized test jig while continuously recording images using dual-camera set-up from tensile surface and edge of the specimen. A stochastic pattern {{is applied to the}} specimen prior to the test and the images are later processed to analyze the development and localization of strains based on digital image correlation (or DIC) method. Strain maps from DIC analysis are utilized to determine the limit strain {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>bend</b> <b>line,</b> as well as from FE modeling of bend-stretching tests, using maximum major strain acceleration criterion for localized necking proposed by one of the authors.

Upper-state term values have been determined, and have been fitted to J(J+ 1) power-series expansions in order to obtain the excited v 8 substate origins.

40|$|Rubber forming is {{a common}} process for the {{fabrication}} of flanged metallic parts in the aerospace industry. The process enables cheap tooling, which is important since the product series are limited. In the process a rigid and a soft tool are combined to form a metal blank into the required shape. Most components made in this way are “flanged parts”, i. e. parts with a rather flat web plate and curved flanges at {{the periphery of the}} web plate. For flanged parts the determination of spring back of the flanges, straight or curved, is important, since the forming dies compensated with the spring back, should result in accurate products. Like all metal forming processes elastic and plastic deformations are combined in the same process cycle. The elastic deformations result in spring back and residual stresses, the ratio between these two depends on the shape of the product and the distribution of the plastic and elastic deformations. In this research an aluminium alloy was used. The low Young’s modulus of this alloy results in rather high elastic responses upon deformation. Other aspects that have been evaluated are the effect of processing parameters like friction and distribution of strains. For stretch flanges the strain is distributed evenly along the flange, but not for shrink flanges, where buckling plays a role. Experimental research shows that the spring back of the flanges depend on a number of variables like the thickness, flange geometry, and material parameters. The spring back of a flange is also a mixture of different contributions: spring back due to the bending over the <b>bend</b> <b>line,</b> spring back due to the curvature of the flange, and spring back due to in-plane deformations. The research performed focused on the different components of the spring back and their interaction. Analysis of the data resulted in a new parameter by which a number of variables could be captured. This improves the understanding of the spring back phenomena and a generalization of the results...|$|E
