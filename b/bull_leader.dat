5000|$|Bull Nunatak (...) is a nunatak {{which lies}} 3 nmi km west of Bruce Nunatak in the Seal Nunataks group, off {{the east coast}} of the Antarctic Peninsula. It was first charted in 1902 by the Swedish Antarctic Expedition under Otto Nordenskiöld, and named by him for Henrik Johan <b>Bull,</b> <b>leader</b> with Captain Leonard Kristensen of a Norwegian {{expedition}} to the Antarctic, 1894-95.|$|E
50|$|The Nez Perce {{homeland}} territory was in {{the states}} now known as Oregon, Washington and Idaho. In 1873, Chief Joseph negotiated {{with the federal government}} to ensure his people could stay on their land in the Wallowa Valley as stipulated in 1855 and 1863 land treaties with the U.S. government. But, in a reversal of policy in 1877, General Oliver O. Howard threatened to attack if the Indians did not relocate to an Idaho reservation that was {{only a small fraction of}} their original territory. Chief Joseph reluctantly agreed. As they began their journey to Idaho, Chief Joseph learned that three young Nez Percé men, enraged at the loss of their homeland, had massacred a band of white settlers. Fearing U.S. Army retaliation, Chief Joseph decided that the best way to avoid the official U.S. Government policy of forcing Native Americans onto reservations was to escape to Canada, where he believed that his people would be treated differently and they could unite with Sitting <b>Bull,</b> <b>leader</b> of a band of Lakota there.|$|E
50|$|The Indians were wary of {{approaching}} the fort. A joint camp of Southern Cheyenne and Oglala Sioux was established thirty miles away at Pawnee Fork. A handful of Indians entered the fort, including Tall <b>Bull,</b> <b>leader</b> of the Cheyenne Dog Soldiers. Hancock threatened them with war {{if they did}} not agree to his terms, but they responded by returning to their camp. Angered that many Indian leaders had not met him, Hancock declared that if the Indians would not come to him, he would go to them and prepared to move his whole force to Pawnee Fork. The Indian agents again warned him that this would be seen as aggression and was not a good idea. The Indians attempted to stop Hancock approaching the camp by setting fire to the prairie but this failed. Outside the camp there was a confrontation with the Cheyenne leader Roman Nose. Hancock spoke harshly to Roman Nose who then told his companion, Bull Bear, to ride away because he intended to kill Hancock in front of his soldiers and did not want Bull Bear to be killed in the inevitable hail of bullets that would follow. Instead Bull Bear led Roman Nose away. Hancock then ordered the camp to be captured, but on entering, it was found to be deserted. The Indians, fearing a repeat of the Sand Creek massacre, had already left and scattered.|$|E

50|$|Weldon pursued her {{interests}} in art. After her divorce on 18 July 1883 from Dr. Claude Schlatter and having {{been abandoned by}} Stevenson, she became committed {{to the cause of}} Native Americans. After she had inherited some money upon the death of her mother in April 1887 she had the means to freely pursue her interests and sometimes thereafter she changed her name to Caroline Weldon, presumably to allow her to put her past behind her, although her exact reasons for this action remain unknown. In the summer of 1889 Caroline Weldon traveled to Dakota Territory to fulfill her dream of living among the Sioux. She had joined NIDA, the National Indian Defense Association, headed by Dr. Thomas Bland and his wife Cora Bland, embarking on a quest to aid the Sioux in their struggle to fight the US government’s attempt under the Dawes Act to expropriate vast portions of the Great Sioux Reservation for the purpose of opening same up for white settlement, with the intent of rendering the creations of the two new states of North Dakota and South Dakota economically viable. She befriended Sitting <b>Bull,</b> <b>leader</b> of the traditionalist faction among the Sioux acting as his secretary, interpreter and advocate. After she had moved to live at Sitting Bull’s compound on the Grand River at Standing Rock Indian Reservation with her young son Christie, her confrontations and open defiance of Indian Agent James McLaughlin did not endear her to the general public, causing the latter to initiate a smear campaign, resulting in her being hated and reviled by much of the white community and vilified in the national press. When in summer of 1890, the Ghost Dance Movement swept through the Indian Reservations of the West; she denounced it and warned Sitting Bull that it would give the government an excuse to harm him and summon the military for intervention against his people that would result in the destruction of the Sioux Nation. Sitting Bull turned against her and upon her son Christie falling ill in November of that year, she decided to leave. The subsequent events of Sitting Bull’s murder and the Wounded Knee Massacre the following December proved her right, adding to her sense of futility and failure. Her son Christie died on 19 November 1890 near Pierre on the riverboat Chaska while on her way to her new home in Kansas City, MO. She lived briefly in the latter city with her nephew Friedrich William Schleicher, a school teacher, only to return eventually to Brooklyn, NY. She disappeared into obscurity soon after.|$|E

50|$|The Henry Bull {{house was}} {{located on the}} eastern side of Spring Street in Newport near modern-day Bull Street and Broadway. According to turn-of-the-twentieth-century {{research}} by Norman Isham, the back part of the stone house was built around 1639 by Henry <b>Bull,</b> a Quaker <b>leader</b> and one of the original settlers of Portsmouth and Newport. Bull served as a colonial militia officer and jail keeper. The original Newport jail may {{have been part of the}} house. Henry Bull died at the house in 1694 and was the last survivor of the original founders of Rhode Island. Large modifications were made to the house in later decades. Henry's son, Jireh Bull, constructed a large fortified house in South Kingstown, Rhode Island which was demolished during King Philip's War. A fire burned and destroyed the Henry Bull House on December 29, 1912.|$|R
2500|$|Among the Plains Tribes, {{the long-standing}} {{ceremonial}} tradition {{known as the}} Sun Dance {{was the most important}} religious event of the year. It is a time for prayer and personal sacrifice on behalf of the community, as well as making personal vows. Towards the end of spring in 1876, the Lakota and the Cheyenne held a Sun Dance that was also attended by a number of [...] "Agency Indians" [...] who had slipped away from their reservations. During a Sun Dance around June 5, 1876, on Rosebud Creek in Montana, Sitting <b>Bull,</b> the spiritual <b>leader</b> of the Hunkpapa Lakota, reportedly had a vision of [...] "soldiers falling into his camp like grasshoppers from the sky." [...] At the same time, U.S. military officials were conducting a summer campaign to force the Lakota and the Cheyenne back to their reservations, using infantry and cavalry in a so-called [...] "three-pronged approach".|$|R
2500|$|As the Army {{moved into}} the field on its expedition, it was {{operating}} with incorrect assumptions as {{to the number of}} Indians it would encounter. These assumptions were based on inaccurate information provided by the Indian Agents that no more than 800 hostiles were in the area. The Indian Agents based this estimate on the number of Lakota that Sitting <b>Bull</b> and other <b>leaders</b> had reportedly led off the reservation in protest of U.S. government policies. It was in fact a correct estimate until several weeks before the battle, when the [...] "reservation Indians" [...] joined Sitting Bull's ranks for the summer buffalo hunt. The agents did {{not take into account the}} many thousands of these [...] "reservation Indians" [...] who had unofficially left the reservation to join their [...] "uncooperative non-reservation cousins led by Sitting Bull". Thus, Custer unknowingly faced thousands of Indians, including the 800 non-reservation [...] "hostiles". All Army plans were based on the incorrect numbers. Although Custer was severely criticized after the battle for not having accepted reinforcements and for dividing his forces, it must be understood that he had accepted the same official government estimates of hostiles in the area which Terry and Gibbon had also accepted. Historian James Donovan states that when Custer asked interpreter Fred Gerard for his opinion on the size of the opposition, he estimated the force at between 1,500 to 2,500 warriors.|$|R
50|$|The {{events at}} Sand Creek sparked outrage among the Arapaho and Cheyenne {{resulting}} in {{three decades of}} war {{between them and the}} United States. Much of the hostilities took place in Colorado leading to many of the events being referred to as part of the so-called Colorado War. Battles and hostilities elsewhere on the southern plains such as in Kansas and Texas are often included as part of the “Comanche Wars”. During the wars, the Arapaho and Cheyenne allies the Kiowa, Comanche, and Plains Apache would participate in some battles alongside them. The Lakota from the north came down into northern Colorado to help the Arapaho and Cheyenne there. The Battle of Julesburg resulted from a force of about 1000 allied Northern Arapaho, Cheyenne (mostly from the Dog Soldiers warrior society), and Lakota from the Brulé and Oglala sub-tribes. The point of the raid was retaliation for the events at the Sand Creek Massacre months earlier. The allied Indian forces attacked settlers and US Army forces around the valley of the South Platte River near Julesburg, Colorado. The battle was a decisive Indian victory resulting in 14 soldiers and four civilians dead and probably no Indian casualties. A force of around 3000 Southern Arapaho, Northern Cheyenne, and Lakota attacked soldiers and civilians at a bridge crossing the North Platte River resulting in the Battle of Platte Bridge. The battle was another victory for the Indians resulting in 29 soldiers killed with at least eight Indian casualties. Arapaho, Cheyenne, Comanche, Kiowa, and Plains Apaches seeking peace were offered to sign the Medicine Lodge Treaty in October 1867. The treaty allotted the Southern Arapaho a reservation with the Southern Cheyenne between the Arkansas and Cimarron rivers in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). Among those that signed the treaty was Chief Little Raven. Those that did not sign the treaty were called “hostile” and were continually pursued by the US Army and their Indian scouts. The last major battle between the Arapaho and the US on the southern plains was the Battle of Summit Springs in northernmost Colorado. The battle involved a force of around 450 Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Lakota warriors and 244 US soldiers and around 50 Pawnee scouts under Frank North. The most prominent Indian leader at the battle was Tall <b>Bull,</b> a <b>leader</b> of the Dog Soldiers warrior society of the Cheyenne. The battle was a US victory resulting in around 35 warriors killed (including Tall Bull) and a further 17 captured. The soldiers suffered only a single casualty. The death of Tall Bull was a major loss for the Dog Soldiers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Energy drink {{consumption}} {{has continued}} to gain in popularity since the 1997 debut of Red <b>Bull,</b> the current <b>leader</b> in the energy drink market. Although energy drinks are targeted to young adult consumers, {{there has been little}} research regarding energy drink consumption patterns among college students in the United States. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine energy drink consumption patterns among college students, prevalence and frequency of energy drink use for six situations, namely for insufficient sleep, to increase energy (in general), while studying, driving long periods of time, drinking with alcohol while partying, and to treat a hangover, and prevalence of adverse side effects and energy drink use dose effects among college energy drink users. Methods Based on the responses from a 32 member college student focus group and a field test, a 19 item survey was used to assess energy drink consumption patterns of 496 randomly surveyed college students attending a state university in the Central Atlantic region of the United States. Results Fifty one percent of participants (n = 253) reported consuming greater than one energy drink each month in an average month for the current semester (defined as energy drink user). The majority of users consumed energy drinks for insufficient sleep (67 %), to increase energy (65 %), and to drink with alcohol while partying (54 %). The majority of users consumed one energy drink to treat most situations although using three or more was a common practice to drink with alcohol while partying (49 %). Weekly jolt and crash episodes were experienced by 29 % of users, 22 % reported ever having headaches, and 19 % heart palpitations from consuming energy drinks. There was a significant dose effect only for jolt and crash episodes. Conclusion Using energy drinks is a popular practice among college students for a variety of situations. Although for the majority of situations assessed, users consumed one energy drink with a reported frequency of 1 – 4 days per month, many users consumed three or more when combining with alcohol while partying. Further, side effects from consuming energy drinks are fairly common, and a significant dose effect was found with jolt and crash episodes. Future research should identify if college students recognize the amounts of caffeine that are present in the wide variety of caffeine-containing products that they are consuming, the amounts of caffeine that they are consuming in various situations, and the physical side effects associated with caffeine consumption. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The {{final verdict}} of the Supreme Court on church dispute {{opened the door}} for reunification of the Church, which was divided for over two decades. On {{receiving}} the details of the Court Order, the General Body of the diocese was summoned and it was unanimously decided that the diocese should accept the decision of the court and a request to the Patriarch be sent that a bull be issued for the unity of the Church. The bull was received on 1 August 1995 asking the leadership to work towards the unity of the Church and, if required, the patriarch was willing to relinquish his position and leave for wilderness. However, a group in the leadership was not willing to abide by the order. The bull of the patriarch was not published in Angamali diocese. A committee was formed with Thomas Mar Dionysius Metropolitan to work with Orthodox faction and formulate details of the unification of two factions. After five sittings, and when the draft document was almost ready, Thomas Mar Dionysius walked out of the meeting. Then the patriarch sent another <b>bull</b> asking the <b>leaders</b> {{to make sure that the}} unity was established before 28 February 1997. But nothing happened. The Patriarch invited all the bishops of the patriarch faction to Damascus for discussion. Only three bishops including Yuhanon Mar Meletius [...] of the diocese, attended the meeting. In the meantime the diocesan general body again met and reiterated the earlier decision for the unity of the Church. The Priests and the spiritual organizations also met independently and appealed to the patriarch to execute the decision of the Supreme Court. But hurdles were made by some of the leaders and unity was further delayed. Again and again clarification questions were filed in the Supreme Court by some of the leaders to prolong the execution of the process of unity. As the court was committed to the cause of unity, it gave its final order to conduct a joint Malankara Association with representatives of both parties with the retired Supreme Court Judge Mr. Malimath as the observer. The meeting was held at Parumala and more than one hundred parishes from the erstwhile Patriarch faction and all of the former Catholicos faction participated in the meeting. The Association declared all the participating bishops as the bishops of the Malankara Orthodox Church as directed by the court and Baselios Mar Thoma Mathews II, the Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan of the East as the lawful Malankara Metropolitan.|$|R
