40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} the {{development}} of a test bench which can be used to check the behaviour of bicycle brakes (disc brakes and in the next stage of extension rim brakes) during a brake cycle under dry and wet conditions is described. Additional, there is the option to perform endurance tests. For the dimensioning of the test bench, calculations of theoretical possible brake torques, measurements with acceleration sensors, high speed camera and Fuji Prescale measuring Films have been done. A special focus was laid on usability and the reducing of the mechanical changing time during serial tests. The programmed real-time control, based on a LabView RealTime System was created to automate the test procedure as it is defined in the test protocol. The system gives information about <b>brake</b> <b>hysteresis</b> function, a function connecting the lever(hand) - and measured brake force(torque) ...|$|E
40|$|Control {{functions}} for the base-braking and emergency braking situations are {{important element of}} the vehicle active safety and have high requirements to robustness. The corresponding control algorithms should be reliable, provide sufficient level of system adaptiveness {{and be able to}} reject external disturbances. This demands not only the well-organized controller from the theoretical point of view, but also its systematic experimental validation. Moreover, effects and factors, which can potentially produce deterioration of braking system control functions, should be properly taken into account in the simulation and during the experiments. Another important factor is that brake control systems have a closed-loop operation with the tyre-road interaction, and its operation is accompanied by such complex effects like (i) variation of disc/pad friction coefficient and (ii) <b>brake</b> <b>hysteresis.</b> This produces strong demand on extension of the conventional testing facilities for the braking system control evaluation. Therefore, besides the part of the control system design, this paper represents possible advancement of hardware-in-the-loop testing procedure for development and validation of braking system control functions...|$|E
50|$|When {{electricity}} {{is removed from}} the <b>brake,</b> the <b>hysteresis</b> disk is free to turn, and no relative force is transmitted between either member. Therefore, the only torque seen between the input and the output is bearing drag.|$|R
40|$|The Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} {{commutator}} direct current motors and electronically commutated motors of company Maxon motor AG. The {{first part of}} its deals basic structural elements and focuses {{on the characteristics of}} these engines, such as lifetime, revolution properties, efficiency and control methods. The thesis deals with properties, principle of operation and construction of <b>hysteresis</b> <b>brake.</b> Another important theme is improved by the construction of the dynamometer. The last part contains the actual measurement of DC commutator motors assigned Maxon RE and Maxon S, which are loaded with <b>hysteresis</b> <b>brake</b> and final evaluation measurements comparing measured values with the data producer...|$|R
40|$|The Vectorial Torque Control {{algorithm}} is applied {{in order to}} impose the re-adhesion trajectory in an induction motor drive for traction purposes. It allows to achieve a very strong anti-skidding action assuring, at the same time, low stress for the mechanical parts. The efficacy of the proposed control strategy has been validated by an experiment. Several skid effects have been achieved {{by means of an}} high dynamic performance <b>hysteresis</b> <b>brake</b> assembled on the controlled motor shaft, which allows to impose any load torque profile. The results obtained by the experiment fully confirm the validity of the proposed control strategy...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies <b>hysteresis</b> {{of vehicle}} <b>brakes</b> and its {{influence}} on the vehicle dynamics. The experimental investigation clearly shows the non-linear and asymmetric characteristics of hysteresis of the disk brakes in passenger cars. A computational model of the brake mechanism with hysteretic elements, based on the Bouc–Wen method, is developed and verified with experimental data. Using the developed model, the influence of hysteresis on the vehicle dynamics during straight-line braking with an anti-lock braking system is analysed. It is also observed that the variations in the hysteresis parameters have important influences on the main vehicle brake characteristics such as the stopping (brake) distance, the time of braking and the average deceleration. A comparative analysis of the simulation results is also given for <b>braking</b> with zero <b>hysteresis</b> or with hysteresis represented as a signal delay and linear function...|$|R
5000|$|Hysteresis dynamometers use a steel rotor that {{is moved}} through flux lines {{generated}} between magnetic pole pieces. This design (as {{in the usual}} [...] "disc type" [...] eddy current absorbers) allows for full torque to be produced at zero speed, {{as well as at}} full speed. Heat dissipation is assisted by forced air. Hysteresis and [...] "disc type" [...] EC dynamometers {{are one of the most}} efficient technologies in small ( [...] and less) dynamometers. A <b>hysteresis</b> <b>brake</b> is an eddy current absorber that, unlike most [...] "disc type" [...] eddy current absorbers, puts the electromagnet coils inside a vented and ribbed cylinder and rotates the cylinder, instead of rotating a disc between electromagnets. The potential benefit for the hysteresis absorber is that the diameter can be decreased and operating RPM of the absorber may be increased.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A {{fractional}} horsepower dynamometer was {{developed as a}} general purpose hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulation platform to emulate mechanical nonlinearities such as frictions, state-dependent disturbances, etc. This lab system {{can be used as}} a research platform to test various nonlinear control schemes. This platform can also be used as a laboratory experiment for ECE 5320 “Mechatronics ” and ECE 7330 “Nonlinear and Adaptive Control ” courses at Utah State University. The novelty of this platform lies in its ability to generate an arbitrary external torque load disturbance, using a controllable <b>hysteresis</b> <b>brake,</b> to a DC motor plant. Therefore, many nonlinear systems and controls can be emulated physically. In this paper, we include some sample experimental results to show the versatility of the dynamometer in emulating nonlinearities and the effectiveness in real-time testing of advanced nonlinear control schemes.
