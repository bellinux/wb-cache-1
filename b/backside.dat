5|$|For years, Europeans in Africa {{had heard}} of an animal that they came to call the 'African unicorn'. In his travelogue of {{exploring}} the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley mentioned a kind of donkey that the natives called the atti, which scholars later identified as the okapi. Explorers may have seen the fleeting view of the striped <b>backside</b> as the animal fled through the bushes, leading to speculation that the okapi {{was some sort of}} rainforest zebra.|$|E
5|$|In {{the cases}} of Lake-effect snow and polar lows, the {{convective}} systems form over warm water bodies when cold air sweeps over their surface and leads {{to an increase in}} moisture and significant vertical motion. This vertical motion leads to the development of showers and thunderstorms in areas of cyclonic flow on the <b>backside</b> of extratropical cyclones.|$|E

5|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are trained}} to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a supercell. They typically look to its rear, the main region of updraft and inflow. Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of tornadogenesis is {{the formation of a}} rotating wall cloud. The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the <b>backside</b> of a supercell.|$|E
5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} is polygynandrous, {{although}} the dominant male in the troop typically breeds with more females than other males. Fighting is most common during the breeding season. A receptive female may initiate mating by presenting her <b>backside,</b> lifting her tail {{and looking at}} the desired male over her shoulder. Males may inspect the female's genitals to determine receptiveness. Females typically mate within their troop, but may seek outside males.|$|E
5|$|The trans diastereoselectivity {{observed}} {{results from}} the reversibility of the initial addition, allowing equilibration to the favored anti betaine over the syn betaine. Initial addition of the ylide results in a betaine with adjacent charges; density functional theory calculations {{have shown that the}} rate-limiting step is rotation of the central bond into the conformer necessary for <b>backside</b> attack on the sulfonium.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{reactions}} were negative at the time. For instance, one journalist wrote: [...] "...a culinary work of whipped cream. One {{can tell a}} woman's hand in this. A group of five <b>backsides</b> is depicted." ...|$|R
50|$|The single {{version was}} remixed {{with a more}} R&B/Hip Hop beat {{compared}} with the album version. A demo version was included on The Fantastic Bee Gees <b>Backsides</b> and More CD which was 3:55 in length.|$|R
5000|$|Variety {{summed up}} the process: [...] "This novelty feature boasts {{of being the first}} {{full-length}} film in Natural Vision 3-D. Although adding <b>backsides</b> to usually flat actors and depth to landscapes, the 3-D technique still needs further technical advances." ...|$|R
5|$|Kraft's {{world record}} {{initially}} came under scrunity, {{as it appeared}} that he touched the snow with his <b>backside</b> as {{he was forced to}} squat down on essentially flat ground. However, slow-motion replay analysis confirmed that his landing was valid, albeit with only millimetres to spare. A week later, Planica caught up to Vikersund with a plethora of more personal bests, and three athletes – including Kraft, twice – landing jumps of or beyond 250m. Kamil Stoch would claim the current hill record of 251.5m, with the season finale competition drawing an attendance of 16,500.|$|E

5|$|The {{remnants}} of Arthur re-intensified somewhat as it traversed The Maritimes; a sting jet with gusts of 65–80mph (100–130km/h) developed along the storm's <b>backside.</b> The former hurricane made an additional landfall {{in the region}} near Fundy National Park by 18:00UTC. By July6, the sting jet had dissipated, and steady weakening of the cyclone resumed as only a split jet provided upper-level support to the storm. Turning back to the northeast, Arthur moved through Labrador later that day. Once over the Labrador Sea, Arthur turned northwest while weakening before doubling back to the southeast. After weakening below gale-force strength, the extratropical system dissipated late on July9.|$|E

5|$|Besides English {{translation}} and localization, the international version of Kingdom Hearts II {{differs from the}} original Japanese version {{in the content of}} gameplay and several scenes. The Hydra boss in the Hercules-themed world Olympus Coliseum had its green blood from the original Japanese version (which was taken from the film) changed into black and purple smoke in the English version. In one cutscene, Hercules fights the Hydra and uses his sword on its head, which eventually releases green blood from its mouth in the Japanese version; this was later changed into drool in the English version. There is also a scene in Disney Castle where, after chasing Donald around for missing a date, Daisy Duck pounds him on the <b>backside</b> in the Japanese version, whereas she merely tells him off inaudibly in the English version.|$|E
5|$|Homer portrays Paul Bunyan, a great {{burden on}} the local townspeople, as he crushes their houses and greedily eats all their food. Eventually, the townspeople drug him and drag him out of their town. Out of loneliness, Bunyan carves a block of stone from the {{mountains}} into a blue ox that he calls Babe, who is rendered alive by an electric shock. In his travels with Babe, Homer creates several landmarks. Bunyan later meets a young woman, (played by Marge) and though she is initially frightened of him, the two fall in love. When a meteor is soon to hit the town, the townspeople call Paul back to help them. Paul obliges and throws the meteor towards Chicago, starting the Great Fire there, but not before it hits him in the <b>backside.</b>|$|E
5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their <b>backside</b> like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E

5|$|Saomai {{continued}} {{moving toward}} the northwest and passed over the Mariana Islands on August 6 while continuing to strengthen, and was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA later that day. The storm then began organizing and intensifying more rapidly, becoming a typhoon early on August 7. Saomai moved into the area of responsibility of PAGASA on August 8, and was designated Typhoon Juan. Due to Saomai's proximity to Tropical Storm Bopha, located near Taiwan, the two underwent a Fujiwhara interaction. This interaction served to shift Saomai's track slightly {{to the south and}} provided the system with in influx of moisture via southwesterly monsoonal flow on the <b>backside</b> of Bopha.|$|E
5|$|The Jets snapped their {{losing streak}} in a 27–13 {{victory over the}} St. Louis Rams in which Sanchez {{completed}} 15 of his 20 passes for 178 {{yards and a touchdown}}. However, his struggles continued in a rematch against New England on Thanksgiving night. Despite completing 26 of 36 of his pass attempts for 301 yards and a touchdown and interception, the Jets lost to the Patriots 49–19 and fell to 4–7 as Sanchez turned the ball over twice—each turnover led to Patriots touchdowns. The Jets surrendered 21 points within a 53-second span on 3 turnovers. The play that earned Sanchez the most criticism was a second-quarter fumble where he ran into the <b>backside</b> of lineman Brandon Moore and the Patriots scored on the resulting fumble; this play, becoming widely known as the butt fumble, was mocked in the media.|$|E
5|$|The promotional cinema {{poster for}} the film {{featured}} a woman holding a crossbow; she was photographed from behind, and her outfit left {{the bottom half of}} her buttocks exposed. The effect was achieved by having the model wear a pair of bikini bottoms backwards, so that the part seen on her <b>backside</b> is actually the front of the suit. The poster caused some furore—largely in the US—with The Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times considering the poster so unsuitable they edited out everything above the knee, whilst the Pittsburgh Press editors painted a pair of shorts over the legs. There was significant speculation as to the identity of the model before photographer Morgan Kane identified her as Joyce Bartle.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, two battalions {{of volunteers}} from Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, led by Generals Oswald H. Ernst and James H. Wilson, settled on {{opposite}} sides of the road to Coamo. On August 9, 1898, the Americans began their offensive, opening cannon fire against the city and completing their attack with artillery fire, the 3rd and 4th Regular Pennsylvania Artillery to provide artillery support for the frontal assault on the Baños, damaging the resort. The Americans intended to encircle and defeat the defenses in the city. A group of soldiers entered the city from the <b>backside,</b> having advanced through a river nearby. The rear assault was reinforced by Wilson's army under General Ernst, attempting to trap the allied soldiers in a crossfire, employing a tactic known as the pincer movement. Martínez Illescas was surprised by the attack and led an improvised attack, but he was killed in the crossfire along with his second-in-command, leaving Captain Hita in charge; he ordered his men to surrender. Half of the allied troops ignored the order, and continued the attack, Troop C galloped at top speed north from the Baños de Coamo, after finding the resort abandoned by the Spanish. Hita's men were sent to a prisoner-of-war camp located at Río Descalabrado, while the men who continued to attack retreated to Aibonito when they realized that the Americans were using a pincer movement.|$|E
5|$|On Falalop Island, the seawall erected during World War II {{was entirely}} {{destroyed}} and allowed storm surge to inundate the island; however, {{at no point}} was the entire island under water. Initially, Falalop was left under 1.2m (4ft) of water, though {{by the time the}} eye moved over this had decreased to 0.6m (2ft). Along the south shore, waves reached 1.8m (6ft) and caused moderate beach erosion. Sand from the coastline was found up to 215m (700ft) inland, filling many taro pits in the island's interior. Along the south shore, two children were killed when their home collapsed, pinning them underneath debris, and water later inundated the area and drowned them. Elsewhere on the island, three people sustained minor injuries. Asor Island experienced most of its flooding as the <b>backside</b> of Ophelia moved through. The island was shortened by 45m (150ft) to the north and southern beaches experienced varying degrees of erosion. Mogmog Island, located at the northern end of the atoll's lagoon, saw the deposition of large boulders and cobblestone along its north shore which covered an area 30 to 45m (100 to 150ft) wide. Flying debris resulted in one injury on both Asor and Mogmog. To the west, Potangeras Island saw an increase in land area by 60m (200ft) as sand was pushed from other areas.|$|E
5|$|One more legend narrated {{is about}} the goddess painted on a thangka in the monastery which is of Palden Lhamo. This female deity is {{compared}} to the Hindu Goddess Kali. Like Kali, Palden Lhamo's thangka is drawn in black colour, with flaming eyes, dressed in skirt made of tiger skin, and a garland of skulls around her neck. A moon disc adorns her hair, {{similar to the one}} seen on Shiva. She is also associated with Goddess Saraswati and Ma Tara. Legend also states that in the past she had lived in Sri Lanka as the consort of a demon king who practiced human sacrifice. As she was not supportive of this practice she fled from the kingdom. As she was running away, the king shot her shot with an arrow, which struck the <b>backside</b> of the mule that she was riding. When she drew out the arrow, it left a gaping hole in the mule's back, and through this gap Palden Lhamo could watch the teachings of Lord Buddha.|$|E

5000|$|In {{spite of}} the title, the film was given a PG rating {{because there was no}} frontal nudity in the film; in the opening theme sequence, a title card reads: [...] "Would you believe... a film called The Nude Bomb would get a PG rating".

There are five times in the film where the bomb is detonated, but in each case the actors cover up their private areas with {{strategically}} placed briefcases or guns (Buckingham palace guards) or are shown only from the waist up. In one case members of a football team are in a huddle when a bomb detonates, revealing bare behinds of some of the players.
