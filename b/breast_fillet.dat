40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of electron beam irradiation in reducing microbial contamination and extending shelf-life in chicken <b>breast</b> <b>fillets</b> was investigated. Because electron beam irradiation can possibly increase lipid oxidation in cooked <b>breast</b> <b>fillets,</b> vacuum packaging was also investigated {{as a means}} of minimizing the effects of lipid oxidation on <b>breast</b> <b>fillets.</b> Boneless, skinless chicken <b>breast</b> <b>fillets</b> were subjected to electron beam irradiation doses of 0. 8, 1. 0, and 1. 8 kGy and stored up to 42 days at 4 C. <b>Breast</b> <b>fillets</b> were also packaged and stored in vacuum packaging in an attempt to reduce effects of electron beam irradiation on lipid oxidation in <b>breast</b> <b>fillets.</b> Microbial analyses were conducted to determine population levels of coliforms, generic E. coli, total aerobic bacteria, psychrotrophs, Salmonella, and Campylobacter in the fillets. Color determination, sensory evaluation, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were used as parameters {{to determine the effects of}} electron beam irradiation on overall quality of <b>breast</b> <b>fillets.</b> Results suggested that even the minimum dose of 0. 8 kGy was effective in eliminating coliforms, generic E. coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter in irradiated samples. Population levels of total aerobic bacteria and psychrotrophs were not completely eliminated, but even the minimum dose of 0. 8 kGy resulted in a substantial decrease in population levels. Vacuum packaging had no effect on population levels. All three levels of irradiation resulted in an increase in a* values or redness of the products with vacuum packaged samples having higher a* values. Results from sensory evaluation indicated that increasing levels of irradiation and storage time resulted in less acceptable products. However, fewer TBARS were observed in <b>breast</b> <b>fillets</b> that had been vacuum packaged and then irradiated indicating that less lipid oxidation occurred. As storage time increased, TBARS also increased, but at a lower rate in both non-irradiated and irradiated vacuum packaged <b>breast</b> <b>fillets.</b> ...|$|R

Visibly light- and dark-colored <b>breast</b> <b>fillets</b> were divided into marinated and control groups, and vacuum-tumbled for 20 min at 4 C under 80 kPa pressure. <b>Breast</b> <b>fillets</b> from the four treatment groups were evaluated for shear values, raw and cooked meat pH, drip-loss, cook-loss, water-holding capacity, and 7 d psychrotrophic count. The light-colored fillets were significantly lighter, less red, and more yellow than the dark fillets. Lightness values increased when fillets were marinated. Moreover, the light fillets had a lower pH than dark fillets. The pH values of raw and cooked breast meat were related to meat color but not marination. Dark-colored fillets had significantly higher marination pick-up and a higher fraction of bound moisture and significantly lower drip and cook-loss. No differences were observed in shear values between color or marination treatments. There {{were no significant differences}} in psychrotrophic plate counts (PPC) or capacitance detection times (CDT) due to color or treatment at Day 1.

40|$|Market trends have {{dictated}} that broilers be reared for divergent market demands for decades. Also, broiler genetic strains have been adapted to meet market demands which include: genetic selection for improved breast meat, {{the practice of}} growing birds to older ages and greater market weights to meet demands, and decreasing postmortem (PM) aging time to improve processing efficiency and fillet yield. These production practices can also affect product quality, specifically boneless <b>breast</b> <b>fillet</b> tenderness and water-holding capacity. To address these factors, a series of experiments were conducted {{to determine the effect}} of strain and slaughter age on meat quality parameters, as well as potential causes of these differences in meat quality. Furthermore, commonly accepted methods for improving boneless <b>breast</b> <b>fillet</b> meat quality were evaluated for the effect of older slaughter age and greater market weights. Based on these results, it appears that, regardless of debone time, broilers reared to greater market weights are tougher than birds reared to a lighter market weight. There are several factors that are compounding this increased toughness, including slower progression of rigor development, greater myofibrillar diameter, and perhaps decreased PM fragmentation; however, the relationship among factors is not fully exploited. Also, it appears that boneless <b>breast</b> <b>fillet</b> marination is critical in these larger birds to alleviate the toughness associated with pre-rigor debone, and may be necessary even when birds are deboned at 24 h PM. Therefore, based on these results it can be recommended that longer PM aging prior to debone is necessary when birds are slaughtered at heavier market weights, and aging the meat off the bone may be beneficial to improving boneless <b>breast</b> <b>fillet</b> tenderness. Furthermore, the commercial practice of tumble-marinating is effective for breast fillets of greater size and may be necessary to avoid negative consumer perception of tenderness...|$|E

40|$|A {{feeding trial}} was {{conducted}} to investigate effects of Bacillus licheniformis on growth performance and meat quality of broilers. Nine hundred one-d-old broiler chicks {{were randomly assigned to}} 3 experimental groups with three replicate pens of 100 broiler chicks. Three treatments were i) control, ii) basal diets supplemented with 1 ml of B. licheniformis for each in feed water per day iii) basal diets supplemented with 2 ml of B. licheniformis per chick in feed water per day. The supplementation of B. licheniformis significantly increased body weight in grower chickens (p< 0. 05), and significantly improved the feed conversion in 3 to 6 and 0 to 6 wk feeding period compared with the control group (p< 0. 05). Additionally, the supplement also resulted in increased protein and free amino acid contents, and decreased fat content in chicken <b>breast</b> <b>fillet</b> (p< 0. 05). Furthermore, improvement in sensory attributes was observed in broilers fed with the probiotic. In conclusion, B. licheniformis treatments resulted in a significant increase (p< 0. 05) in broiler productivity based on an index taking into account daily weight gain and feed conversion rate.

Para tanto, 1. 760 pintos de corte, machos, Cobb 500, foram distribuídos aleatoriamente em oito grupos experimentais em arranjo fatorial 2 x 4 de 4 IAs (12, 24, 36 e 48 h) e dois níveis de LD (1, 143 e 1, 267 %), com quatro repetições e 55 aves por unidade experimental. Met+Cys, Thr e Trp foram balanceados no conceito de proteína ideal. Não houve interação significativa entre LD e IA sobre as variáveis avaliadas. Os maiores pesos do peito desossado e filé de peito aos 21 dias de idade e peso {{corporal}} aos 43 dias foram obtidos no nível de 1, 143 % de LD. O peso do peito desossado, peso do filé, diâmetro das fibras musculares aos 21 dias, peso vivo, peso da carcaça e peso das pernas aos 43 dias de idade decresceram linearmente de acordo com o aumento no intervalo para alojamento. Os resultados deste estudo sugerem que o nível de 1, 143 % de LD favorece aumento no músculo peitoral aos 21 dias e o peso vivo dos frangos aos 43 dias, e que o menor intervalo para o alojamento melhora o desenvolvimento dos músculos peitorais durante a fase inicial, e maior rendimento da carcaça inteira e das pernas no abate. This study {{aimed to}} {{study the effects of}} delayed placement (IA) and dietary lysine levels (LD) in initial diets on breast muscle development and carcass yield of broiler chickens. For this, 1, 760 male Cobb 500 chicks were allocated randomly to eight experimental groups according to a 2 x 4 factorial arrangement for 4 IAs (12, 24, 36 and 48 h) and 2 levels of LD (1. 143 and 1. 267 %) with four replicates and 55 chicks per experimental unit. Met+Cys, Thr and Trp were balanced according to the ideal protein concept. There were no significant interactions between LD and IA on variables evaluated. The highest breast weight and <b>breast</b> <b>fillet</b> weight at 21 days old and body weight at 43 days old were obtained with the dietary lysine level of 1. 143 %. The breast weight, <b>breast</b> <b>fillet</b> weight and muscle fiber diameter at 21 days old, body weight, carcass weight and legs weight at 43 days old decreased linearly according to the increase of the delayed placement. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the 1. 143 % DL level improves the breast muscle development at 21 days old and chicken body weight at 43 days old, and the shortest delayed placement improves the breast muscle development during the initial phase and higher carcass yield and legs at the slaughter...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is {{designed}} to attract attention to macroscobic and microscobic findings, causes and economic losses of wooden breast which is a significant muscle problem leading to visual and sensory differences in poultry breast meat quality. Wooden Breast is a crucial problem in poultry industry. It has started to seriously affect poultry production in European and other countries, and especially in United States of America. Woody breast formation is a situation characterized with completely hardened <b>breast</b> <b>fillet</b> or with swelling easily understood when touched. Surface of the fillet contains exudate with petechial bleeding or non-bleeding viscous gelatine. Woody structure called “wooden” can occur not only in breast meat but also in legs. Growth rate, gender, energy level of the feed, amino acid level, and selenium supplement are the factors affecting wooden breast-woody breast meat formation. Shaded colour, surface leak and abnormally hard tissue are seen in macroscopic image of woody breast. In microscopic findings, muscle fibers are less and round. Lesions don’t contain pathogenic micro-organisms, they are aseptic. Colour of the meat of woody breast is brighter and whiter, and (L* value) This muscle problem affects muscles visually and sensorial; but it doesn’t {{have a negative effect}} on human health. The more white lines and woody structure in breast meat, the less they are accepted among European consumers...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Three {{replicate}} {{trials were}} conducted to compare sensory descriptive profiles of cooked broiler <b>breast</b> <b>fillets</b> categorized by raw meat color lightness or CIE L * values. In each trial, 20 light, 20 dark, and 30 random fillets (42 -d-old birds and deboned at 6 to 8 h postmortem) were obtained from a commercial process-ing plant. On return to the laboratory, CIE L * a * b* (medial side), pH, and weights were measured. Ten fil-lets for each of 3 lightness categories were chosen based on the L * values as follows: light, L *> 60; medium (middle of random group), 55 < L * < 59; and, dark, L * < 55. Cook yield, Warner-Bratzler shear force, and descriptive sensory attributes were measured on the chosen fillets after 7 d of frozen storage followed by cooking to an endpoint temperature of 78 to 80 °C. Sen-sory evaluations were performed by trained descriptive panelists using universal intensity scales of 0 to 15 for 9 flavor and 8 texture attributes. Our results show that {{there were significant differences}} among the 3 lightness categories for pH, thaw loss, cook yield, and shear force. There {{were no significant differences in}} average flavor intensity scores between the 3 lightness categories. However, the average intensity scores of the texture at-tributes cohesiveness, hardness, rate of breakdown, and chewiness of the light fillets were significantly higher than either the dark or the medium fillets (P < 0. 01), which did not differ from each other. These results indi-cate that sensory flavor profiles of cooked broiler <b>breast</b> <b>fillets</b> are similar regardless of raw meat color lightness (or L * values). There is no difference in the texture profiles between the cooked medium and dark fillets. But the sensory texture profile of fillets categorized as light based on CIE L * values is different from those of the fillets categorized as either medium or dark. Comparisons of sensory descriptive flavor and texture profiles of cooked broiler <b>breast</b> <b>fillets</b> categorized by raw meat color lightness values...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Studies on {{prevalence}} of pale, soft, exudative (PSE) condition in Sri Lankan poultry industry is minimal. Hence, {{the objective of}} {{present study was to}} determine the incidence of PSE chicken meat in a commercial meat processing plant and to find out its consequences on meat quality traits of roasted chicken breast. Method A total of 60 <b>breast</b> <b>fillets</b> were randomly selected, evaluated based on color L* value, and placed into 1 of 2 categories; PSE (L*[*]>[*] 58) or normal meat (L*[*]≤[*] 58). A total of 20 <b>breast</b> <b>fillets</b> (10 PSE and 10 normal) were then analyzed for color, pH, and water holding capacity (WHC). After processing those into roasted chicken breast, cooking loss, color, pH, WHC, and texture values were evaluated. A sensory evaluation was conducted using 30 untrained panelists. Results The incidence of PSE meat was 70  % in the present experiment. PSE fillets were significantly lighter and had lower pH values compared with normal fillets. Correlation between the lightness and pH was negative (P[*] [*] 0. 05), an approximately 3  % higher cooking loss was observed in PSE group compared to its counterpart (P[*] [*] 0. 05). Conclusions These results indicated that an economical loss can be expected due to the significantly higher cooking loss observed in roasted breast processed from PSE meat...|$|R
40|$|Forty turkeys were {{allocated}} to five groups of eight birds each. One (control) was fed a basal diet {{while the others}} were fed diets supplemented with either olive leaves at 10 g/kg, rosemary at 10 g/kg, alpha-tocopheryl acetate at 150 or at 300 mg/kg feed. Following slaughter, <b>fillets</b> from the <b>breasts</b> of the birds were stored at 4 degrees C {{in the dark for}} 12 days and their lipid oxidation and microbial growth rate were monitored. Results showed that dietary olive leaves were more effective in inhibiting lipid oxidation of the <b>breast</b> <b>fillets</b> compared to rosemary, but inferior to the dietary supplementation of 300 mg alpha-tocopheryl acetate/kg. In turn, lipid oxidation was more effectively inhibited when the birds received alpha-tocopheryl acetate supplementation at 150 mg/kg compared to when the birds received no suppelementation, but inferior to rosemary supplementation. Total viable counts, lactic acid bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae and psychrotrophic bacterial counts were all increased in <b>breast</b> <b>fillets</b> of all groups throughout refrigerated storage. Diet supplementation with a basal level of alpha-tocopheryl acetate had no effect on the bacterial counts recorded in the control group, but diet supplementation with olive leaves or rosemary resulted in a decrease in all bacterial counts from day 2 of storage and thereafter. During this period olive leaves were more effective in inhibiting bacterial growth than rosemary...|$|R
