5|$|Nine {{hours after}} this all-night session, the band {{returned}} to Abbey Road {{to carry out}} overdubs. Harrison added a second vocal and another acoustic guitar part, the latter consisting of riffs that recall {{the sound of a}} sitar, due to the strings <b>buzzing</b> against the frets. During the same session, McCartney overdubbed bass guitar onto the track. The recording was finished on 9 October, {{with the addition of a}} brief harmony vocal from McCartney and piano, over the middle eight, played by Chris Thomas.|$|E
5|$|The {{music on}} Kaleidoscope Dream draws on R, pop, funk, rock and soul styles, {{as well as}} {{elements}} from electronic and psychedelic music. The album's producers incorporated dense bass lines, <b>buzzing</b> synthesizers, and hazy, reverbed sounds in the songs, which deal mostly with sex, romance, and existential ideas. Miguel titled Kaleidoscope Dream {{as a metaphor for}} life and wanted the songs to reflect his lifestyle and personality.|$|E

5|$|Watson's basic working {{principle}} is to parse keywords in a clue while searching for related terms as responses. This gives Watson some {{advantages and disadvantages}} compared with human Jeopardy! players. Watson has deficiencies in understanding the contexts of the clues. As a result, human players usually generate responses faster than Watson, especially to short clues. Watson's programming prevents it from using the popular tactic of <b>buzzing</b> before it is sure of its response. Watson has consistently better reaction time on the buzzer once it has generated a response, and is immune to human players' psychological tactics, such as jumping between categories on every clue.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{is one of}} {{the major}} insect orders and are of {{considerable}} ecological and human importance. Flies are important pollinators, second only to the bees and their Hymenopteran relatives. Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination. Fruit flies are used as model organisms in research, but less benignly, mosquitoes are vectors for malaria, dengue, West Nile fever, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other infectious diseases, and houseflies spread food-borne illnesses. Flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers, <b>buzzing</b> and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids. Larger flies such as tsetse flies and screwworms cause significant economic harm to cattle. Blowfly larvae, known as gentles, and other dipteran larvae, known more generally as maggots, are used as fishing bait and as food for carnivorous animals. They are also used in medicine in debridement to clean wounds.|$|E

On 10 September, Knox {{wrestled}} for the International Wrestling Zone promotion, defeating Emil Sitoci and Robbie Mireno in a three-way match. On 26 September, Knox competed for German Stampede Wrestling, where she lost to Finnish wrestler Kisu in a singles match. During the match, Knox suffered a cut above her eye, {{for which she}} received stitches. Knox later posted on her website {{that she had been}} suffering from headaches, vision problems and loud <b>buzzing</b> in her left ear since receiving the injury, also being diagnosed with possible damage to her eighth cranial nerve, and as a result canceled all her bookings {{for the rest of the}} year. Knox was expected to participate at a ChickFight television taping on 4 May 2008, but she was removed from the show after no-showing a Shimmer Women Athletes show, stating that she did not believe that wrestling was the correct career choice for her at that time.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 2015, police {{released}} a video {{from the night}} before the theft, that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape; one of them remains unidentified, while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath <b>buzzing</b> the unidentified man into the museum twice within a few minutes. The man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a car and drove off. Police say the video opens new lines of investigation, and The New York Times points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator. However, the guards have previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist.|$|E
5|$|The water pipit's song is {{delivered}} from a perch or in flight, {{and consists of}} four or five blocks, each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note. In comparison, the Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The call of the water pipit is a single or double sharp “dzip” or similar, slightly harsher than soft sip sip sip of the meadow pipit or the shrill pseep of the Eurasian rock pipit. The short, thin fist flight call is intermediate between the sip of the meadow pipit and the rock pipit's feest. The differences between the calls of the pipit species are very subtle, and not diagnostic in the absence of other evidence. The flight call of the subspecies A. s. coutellii is shorter and more <b>buzzing</b> than that of the nominate race.|$|E

5|$|At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu {{is selling}} items to {{customers}} at outrageous prices, like normal. Apu scribbles out the 1989 expiration date on {{a package of}} ham and then lowers the price instead of throwing it out. Homer buys the meat, eats it, and contracts food poisoning. After recovering, Homer returns to the Kwik-E-Mart to complain, and Apu gives him two five-pound buckets of expired shrimp to placate him. Homer eats the shrimp and becomes ill again. Whilst recovering at home, Homer sees the Channel 6 investigative news program Bite Back with Kent Brockman. Lisa gives him the idea to get the show to investigate the Kwik-E-Mart. Kent gives Homer a giant novelty hat containing a spy camera to expose Apu for selling expired food. Though Homer almost immediately abandons the hat after mistaking the <b>buzzing</b> of the machinery as a bee, the camera catches Apu placing a hot dog that he had dropped on the ground back into the hot dog cooker. Apu is immediately fired by his company (even though he was actually following company policy), and is replaced by actor James Woods, who is doing research for a role in an upcoming film.|$|E

When he tries to take the belt, the newer <b>Buzz</b> (who, like Andy's <b>Buzz</b> in the first film, believes he is a real space ranger) attacks him, believing {{that he is a}} disobedient space ranger. The two <b>Buzzes</b> fight and Utility Belt <b>Buzz</b> traps Andy's <b>Buzz</b> in a cardboard rocket ship similar to the one he originally came in. Soon the other toys find Utility Belt <b>Buzz</b> and mistake him for Andy's <b>Buzz,</b> despite <b>Buzz's</b> cries of [...] "You've got the wrong <b>Buzz,</b> YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG BUZZ!". Utility Belt <b>Buzz</b> joins the gang after Rex tells him that he knows how to defeat Emperor Zurg (in a video game.) Andy's <b>Buzz</b> eventually breaks free from his cardboard prison and tracks down Utility Belt <b>Buzz</b> {{and the rest of the}} toys. After arguing with Utility Belt <b>Buzz</b> over who the real <b>Buzz</b> is, he eventually convinces them that he is the real <b>Buzz</b> by showing them the bottom of his boot, which has Andy's name written on it. Although he manages to convince Woody to return home, Stinky Pete stops him, as the latter wants to go to Japan. After <b>Buzz</b> and the gang fight Zurg in the elevator shift, they use a pizza planet truck to chase after Al to the airport (while Utility Belt <b>Buzz</b> staying behind to play with an amnesiac Zurg), with <b>Buzz</b> controlling the steering wheel as well as moving a pizza box on the driver's seat to help him reach it.

Veronica and Meryl go to the police station and find that Sully washed up on shore after surfing with a bump on his head and had mild amnesia. While cleared, Mercer is still being held in custody. Keith rejects Harmony, and Logan nervously calls Keith for the whereabouts of Veronica. At the food court, Veronica is listening to voicemails from Logan and Keith when she notices an issue with her food. She returns to the counter with her plate, leaving her drink unattended. She returns to her seat but, after eating and drinking, soon feels disoriented. She recognizes this feelings as identical to her experience after ingesting GHB previously.

5|$|Polistes exclamans exhibit {{an alarm}} response, {{typical of many}} higher level eusocial Hymenoptera. Although it has been {{previously}} indicated that nest mates may alarm {{the rest of the}} nest through jerky movement and <b>buzzing</b> of wings, Polistes exclamans is capable of alarming the rest of the nest and attracting attacking wasps through chemical means by releasing a non-species-specific venomous alarm pheromone. Although a chemical signal to warn against attack would be evolutionarily adaptive, the Polistes exclamans only releases a response post the initial attack from and on the predator, as the venom is only released during the sting. This venom is capable of warning and coordinating a response from the nest and attracting nearby heterospecific or conspecific females from nearby colonies to attack the predator. This helps deter the predator from further attacking and is especially adaptive for the defense of the nest. Although certain other insects have been able to adapt the release of the pheromone to other means of communicating alarm, Polistes exclamans has yet to do so, indicating that it is still in its “primitive state in evolution of the complex systems of communication of alarm seen in higher social insects.” In one experiment, pheromones were extracted from female glands and sacs and were spread onto venom paper. It was then found that females were attracted upwind of the venom paper and some even attempted to sting it. This also had a heterospecific response where others also reacted to it. While it was found that one wasp couldn’t release enough pheromones to elicit a response, if many individuals were alarmed they would elicit a response {{from the rest of the}} nest. However, this scent is not strong enough to reach other nests, and so neighboring nests must be alarmed by physical movements and wing flapping.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The maximum {{performance}} of a supersonic inlet will be achieved when operating {{as close as possible}} to its <b>buzz</b> boundary. In order to maintain high performance without crossing the <b>buzz</b> boundary, an active <b>buzz</b> margin predictor and controller is necessary. The goal of a control system is to acquire inlet buzzmargin andmaintain it as the designated value and predict inlet <b>buzz</b> before it occurs and then take some measures to <b>buzz</b> mitigation or inlet restart. The inlet <b>buzz</b> boundary and themargin of ducted rocketswere first discussed and analysed. Then the dynamic mathematical model of a gas flow control system was established. Lastly, the inlet <b>buzz</b> margin controller of a ducted rocket was designed. Simulation results show that there exist anti-regulation characteristics for gas flow control for ducted rockets, and it leads to the particularity of inlet <b>buzz</b> margin control for ducted rockets in contrast to liquid ramjet. The designed inlet <b>buzz</b> margin has to be bigger to avoid the appearing of inlet <b>buzz</b> because of anti-regulation characteristics; otherwise, the inlet <b>buzz</b> phenomenon probably appears. If the inlet <b>buzz</b> of the ducted rocket appears, the command of decreasing fuel flow could not be given immediately; otherwise, the inlet <b>buzz</b> will aggravate...|$|R
