50|$|The north west facade by Waterloo <b>Bridge,</b> {{although}} <b>stained</b> by {{pollution and}} rain water, {{is a good}} example of the massive concrete forms popular in 1960s Brutalist architecture in Britain. A slightly raised area, resembling a low stage is provided facing Waterloo Bridge. This may have been intended for outdoor performances.|$|R
5000|$|The pylon again {{closed for}} four weeks in 2003 for the {{installation}} of an exhibit called [...] "Dangerous Works", highlighting the dangerous conditions experienced by the original construction workers on the <b>bridge,</b> and two <b>stained</b> glass feature windows {{in memory of the}} workers.|$|R
50|$|The Radial Pro Series were Peavey's {{high end}} drum line. In {{production}} from 1994 until 2002, {{it consisted of}} the RBS-1 prototypes, radial pro 1000, 750/751, and 500/501 models. The flagship 1000 model consisted of a radial bridge that took all the mounting stresses, and a 3-ply thin maple shell to enhance the resonance. The 750/751 series had composite <b>bridges</b> and <b>stained</b> 4-ply thin maple shells. The 500/501 series had composite bridges and wrapped 5-ply North American thin hickory shells.|$|R

The most notable feature of the reconstruction is an 1890 Tiffany & Company Window. This early Tiffany window <b>bridges</b> the gothic <b>stained</b> glass tradition and emerging art nouveau movement.|$|R
40|$|Bridges for {{treatment}} of the injured spinal cord must stabilize the injury site to prevent secondary damage and create a permissive environment that promotes regeneration. The host response to the bridge is central to creating a permissive environment, as the cell types that respond to the injury {{have the potential to}} secrete both stimulatory and inhibitory factors. We investigated multiple channel bridges for spinal cord regeneration and correlated the bridge structure to cell infiltration and axonal elongation. Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) bridges were fabricated by a gas foaming/particulate leaching process. Channels within the bridge had diameters of 150 or 250 [*]μm, and {{the main body of the}} bridge was highly porous with a controllable pore size. Upon implantation in a rat spinal cord hemisection site, cells infiltrated into the bridge pores and channels, with the pore size influencing the rate of infiltration. The pores had significant cell infiltration, including fibroblasts, macrophages, S- 100 β-positive cells, and endothelial cells. The channels of the bridge were completely infiltrated with cells, which had aligned axially, and consisted primarily of fibroblasts, S- 100 β-positive cells, and endothelial cells. Reactive astrocytes were observed primarily outside of the <b>bridge,</b> and <b>staining</b> for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans was decreased in the region surrounding the bridge relative to studies without <b>bridges.</b> Neurofilament <b>staining</b> revealed a preferential growth of the neural fibers within the bridge channels relative to the pores. Multiple channel bridges capable of supporting cellular infiltration, creating a permissive environment, and directing the growth of neural fibers have potential for promoting and directing spinal cord regeneration...|$|R
40|$|We herein {{report a}} rare case of {{squamous}} cell carcinoma of the hilar bile duct. A 66 -year-old Japanese male patient was admitted to our hospital because of appetite loss and jaundice. Abdominal computed tomography revealed an enhanced mass measuring 10 × 30 mm in the hilar bile duct region. After undergoing biliary drainage, the patient underwent extended right hepatic lobectomy with regional lymph nodes dissection. The tumor had invaded the right portal vein. Therefore, we also performed resection and reconstruction of the portal vein. Histopathologically, the carcinoma cells exhibited a solid structure with differentiation to {{squamous cell carcinoma}} with keratinization and intercellular <b>bridges.</b> Immunohistochemical <b>staining</b> of the tumor cells revealed positive cytokeratin staining and negative CAM 5. 2 staining. Based on these findings, a definitive diagnosis of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the hilar bile duct was made...|$|R
50|$|The World Building was {{demolished}} in 1955 for {{the expanded}} car ramp {{entrance to the}} Brooklyn <b>Bridge.</b> A large <b>stained</b> glass window by Otto Heinigke (1850-1915), combining the Statue of Liberty and the New York World banner, which had been installed over the William Street entrance to the building in 1908 (The World had helped raise funds from the public for the statue's pedestal), was bought by a group headed by a Columbia journalism professor when the building was condemned in 1953. The window is now in Room 305 of the Columbia University School of Journalism, where it serves as the backdrop for many events, including the annual presentation of the Pulitzer Prizes.|$|R

40|$|Formation of {{hard tissue}} {{following}} treatment of pulp exposures {{has been observed}} in both clinical and experimental studies. However {{it is not known}} if such tissue has the functions of primary dentin which are likely to be important in protecting the pulp from the oral environment. Objectives: To study the expression of two relatively specific markers for dentin; dentin sialoprotein (DSP) and type 1 collagen (Col I) in human teeth experimentally pulp capped either with Emdogain®Gel (Biora AB, Malmö, Sweden) - a derivative of enamel matrix (EMD) in a propylene glycol alginate vehicle, or with calcium hydroxide. Methods: Nine pairs of contra-lateral premolars scheduled for extraction on orthodontic grounds were experimentally pulp amputated and capped with EMDgel or calcium hydroxide. After 12 weeks the teeth were extracted, prepared for light microscopic examination and stained using affinity-purified rabbit anti-Col I and anti-DSP polyclonal antibodies. Results: In the EMDgel treated teeth, new tissue partly filled the space initially occupied by the gel and hard tissue was formed alongside exposed dentin surfaces and in patches in the adjacent pulp tissue. In the calcium hydroxide treated teeth, the new hard tissue was formed as a <b>bridge.</b> DSP <b>staining</b> was seen in the newly formed hard tissue and in the cells lining it in both groups but was more marked in the EMDgel treated teeth. Col I staining was seen in the newly formed hard tissue in both groups. Conclusion: The expression of DSP and Col I suggests that the new hard tissue formed after pulp capping with EMDgel or calcium hydroxide is dentin.

40|$|Mutations in BLM cause Bloom's syndrome, a {{disorder}} associated with cancer predisposition and chromosomal instability. We investigated whether BLM {{plays a role}} in ensuring the faithful chromosome segregation in human cells. We show that BLM-defective cells display a higher frequency of anaphase bridges and lagging chromatin than do isogenic corrected derivatives that eptopically express the BLM protein. In normal cells undergoing mitosis, BLM protein localizes to anaphase bridges, where it colocalizes with its cellular partners, topoisomerase IIIα and hRMI 1 (BLAP 75). Using BLM staining as a marker, we have identified a class of ultrafine DNA bridges in anaphase that are surprisingly prevalent in the anaphase population of normal human cells. These so-called BLM–DNA <b>bridges,</b> which also <b>stain</b> for the PICH protein, frequently link centromeric loci, and are present at an elevated frequency in cells lacking BLM. On the basis of these results, we propose that sister-chromatid disjunction is often incomplete in human cells even after the onset of anaphase. We present a model for the action of BLM in ensuring complete sister chromatid decatenation in anaphase...|$|R
40|$|Insulin is an {{important}} hormone used by the cells in the body for regulating the uptake of glucose. The insulin molecule consists of one A and one B chain. The chains contain 21 and 30 amino acids, respectively. Two sulphide bridges between the cysteine acids link the two chains together so that the protein can function. By staining the insulin with a fluorescent stain called Alexa Fluor 488, protein residues on a surface can be microscoped with a confocal microscope. In this project the sulphur <b>bridges</b> on <b>stained</b> and unstained insulin are reduced, forming unbound polypeptide chains and it is attempted to separate the chains in fractions by using the size chromatography, native and SDS PAGE, ion exchange chromatography and HPLC methods. The detector is a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The proteins are measured in the ultraviolet range of 280 nm, and the stain is measured in the visual range of 490 nm. Size chromatography using PD 10 column showed interaction with the column, and the insulin was retained. Native PAGE of the A and B chain did not show the expected separating bands. The SDS PAGE method proved more applicable {{but not for the}} purpose of this project. Ion exchange chromatography revealed fraction of the B chain in the first sample with an ABSmax at 276 nm and subsequently fraction of the A chain with an ABSmax at 271 nm. HPLC measurements confirmed these results and chromatograms showed that retention time for the colour peaks rose to the same level as for the A chain. The retention time for the A and B chain also rose after reaction with Alexa Fluor 488. Laboratory results showed that the B chain insulin may have been stained whereas this was apparently not the case for the A chain insulin...|$|R
40|$|The {{cycle of}} spindle pole body (SPB) duplication, differentiation, and {{segregation}} in Schizosaccharomyces pombe {{is different from}} that in some other yeasts. Like the centrosome of vertebrate cells, the SPB of S. pombe spends most of interphase in the cytoplasm, immediately next to the nuclear envelope. Some gamma-tubulin is localized on the SPB, suggesting that it plays a role in the organization of interphase microtubules (MTs), and serial sections demonstrate that some interphase MTs end on or very near to the SPB. gamma-Tubulin is also found on osmiophilic material that lies near the inner surface of the nuclear envelope, immediately adjacent to the SPB, even though there are no MTs in the interphase nucleus. Apparently, the MT initiation activities of gamma-tubulin in S. pombe are regulated. The SPB duplicates in the cytoplasm during late G 2 phase, and the two resulting structures are connected by a darkly <b>staining</b> <b>bridge</b> until the mitotic spindle forms. As the cell enters mitosis, the nuclear envelope invaginates beside the SPB, forming a pocket of cytoplasm that accumulates dark amorphous material. The nuclear envelope then opens to form a fenestra, and the duplicated SPB settles into it. Each part of the SPB initiates intranuclear MTs, and then the two structures separate to lie in distinct fenestrae as a bipolar spindle forms. Through metaphase, the SPBs remain in their fenestrae, bound to the polar ends of spindle MTs; at about this time, a small bundle of cytoplasmic MTs forms in association with each SPB. These MTs are situated with one end near to, but not on, the SPBs, and they project into the cytoplasm at an orientation that is oblique to the simple axis. As anaphase proceeds, the nuclear fenestrae close, and the SPBs are extruded back into the cytoplasm. These observations define new fields of enquiry about the control of SPB duplication and the dynamics of the nuclear envelope...|$|R
