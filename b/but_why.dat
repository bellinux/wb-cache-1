5|$|Robert of Ghent or Robert de Gant (c. 1085–after 1154) was Lord Chancellor of England and Dean of York in the 12th century. The {{younger son}} of a nobleman, Robert was {{probably}} {{a member of the}} cathedral chapter of York before his selection as chancellor by King Stephen of England in the mid-1140s. He is not mentioned often in documents from his time as chancellor, <b>but</b> <b>why</b> this is so is unknown. He became dean at York Minster around 1147. Robert was slightly involved in the disputes over who would be Archbishop of York in the late 1140s and 1150s, but it is likely that his chancellorship prevented his deeper involvement in diocesan affairs. He was no longer chancellor after the death of Stephen, but probably continued to hold the office of dean until his death around 1157 or 1158.|$|E
25|$|The {{explanation}} {{given for}} the success of administrating Tetris as opposed to other interventions is that Tetris draws heavily on visuospatial processing power. Because the brain only has a limited supply of resources to process information, playing Tetris hinders the ability of the brain to focus on other visual information, such as traumatic images. However, the details of the event can still be thought of and rehearsed verbally, as Tetris should not interfere with verbal processes of the brain. This explains why participants could remember the details of the footage they watched <b>but</b> <b>why</b> they still experienced fewer flashbacks.|$|E

25|$|The {{intracellular}} {{metabolism theory}} explains {{how and why}} remarkable dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects can occur, <b>but</b> <b>why</b> dissociation is invariably incomplete. In support of the model is the rare condition congenital 5α-reductase deficiency, in which the 5α-reductase enzyme is defective, production of DHT is impaired, and DHT levels are very low while testosterone levels are normal. Males with this condition are born with ambiguous genitalia and an underdeveloped prostate gland. In addition, saliently, such males develop normal musculature, voice changes/deepening, and libido at puberty, but have little to no acne or facial, pubic, or body hair, minimal enlargement of the prostate, and no incidence of male-pattern baldness or prostate cancer. They also notably do not develop gynecomastia {{as a consequence of}} their condition.|$|E
25|$|The {{pectoral}} girdle is discussed by Chatterjee as being highly derived in Protoavis, displaying synapomorphies of avialans more derived than Archaeopteryx, including {{the presence of}} a hypocleidium-bearing furcula, and a hypertrophied, carinate sternum. Chatterjee's interpretation of the fossils identified as such in his reviews of the Protoavis material are open to question due to the preservation quality of the elements and as of this time, {{it is not clear whether}} either character was in fact present in Protoavis. The glenoid appears to be oriented dorsolaterally permitting a wide range of humeral movement. Chatterjee implies that this is a highly derived trait which allies Protoavis to Aves, <b>but</b> <b>why</b> this should be so is not clearly discussed in the descriptions of the animal. In and of itself, the orientation of the glenoid is not a sufficient basis for placing Protoavis within Aves. The scapular blade is far broader than illustrated by Chatterjee in his 1997 account, and not particularly avian in its gross form. The coracoid, identified by Chatterjee as strut-like and retroverted, is, like the supposed furcula and sternum, too poorly preserved to permit accurate identification. Moreover, the original spatial relationship of the alleged coracoid to the scapula is entirely unknown. Uncinate processes and sternal ribs are missing.|$|E
25|$|The 19th century Italian writer Arturo Graf {{gives this}} version of the legend in his 1889 book Il Diavolo : There was once a duchess of Normandy who was tormented with a desire to have {{children}} and yet could have none. Weary of recommending herself to God, who will not listen to her, she betakes herself to the Devil, and her wish is speedily satisfied. A son is born to her, a veritable firebrand. As an infant, he bites his nurse and tears out her hair; as a lad, he knifes his teachers; at the age of twenty, he becomes a bandit chief. He is dubbed knight, in the belief that thus the wicked instincts raging within him may be overcome; but thereafter he is worse than he was before. No one surpasses him in strength or in courage. In a tourney he overthrows and slays thirty opponents; then he goes roaming about the world; then he returns to his native land, and begins once more to play the bandit, robbing, burning, murdering, ravishing. One day, after cutting the throats of all the nuns of a certain abbey, he remembers his mother and goes in search of her. Soon as they spy him, the servants take to their heels, scattering in all directions; not one tarries to ask him whence he comes or what he desires. Then, {{for the first time in}} his life, Robert is astounded at the horror which he inspires in his fellow-beings; for the first time, he becomes conscious of his own monstrous wickedness, and he feels how his heart is pierced by the sharp tooth of remorse. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> is he wickeder than other men? Why was he born thus? Who made him what he is? An ardent longing seizes him to unravel this mystery. He hastens to his mother, and with drawn sword he adjures her to unveil to him the secret of his birth. Learning this, he becomes frantic with terror, shame, and grief. But his sturdy nature is not weakened; he does not yield to despair; instead, the hope of a laborious redemption, of a marvelous victory, urges and spurs on his proud spirit. He will learn to conquer Hell, to subdue himself, to thwart the designs of that accursed fiend who created him to serve his own ends, who has made of him a docile instrument of destruction and of sin. And he makes no delay. He goes to Rome, casts himself at the feet of the pope, makes confession to a holy hermit, submits himself to the harshest kind of penance, and swears that henceforth he will taste no food that he has not first wrested from the jaws of a dog. On two separate occasions, when Rome was besieged by the Saracens, he fights incognito for the Emperor and gains the victory for the Christians. Recognized at last, he refuses all rewards and honors, the imperial crown, even the monarch's own daughter, goes away to dwell with his hermit in the wilderness, and dies a saint, blessed by both God and men. In other accounts, he finally weds the beautiful princess who is deeply in love with him.|$|E

500|$|In {{many of her}} World Grand Championship portraits, Nipper {{painted a}} montage {{depicting}} the horse's life and show career.

[...] The style soon caught on and was requested by other horse owners. Nipper herself bred Tennessee Walking Horses, and once bred a mare to The Whole Nine Yards, a World Grand Champion, of whom she had previously painted a portrait. Although the portrait was painted before the horse ever won a title, Nipper depicted him with roses around his head. The horse's owner later said she almost sent the picture back.|$|E

500|$|... "Nobody Knows Me" [...] has vocoder effects, spacey synths, bubbly bass. IGN Music's Spencer D. {{described}} {{that the}} song blips, glurgs, and shuffles with a Jetsons' styled disco {{ebb and flow}} and sounds like as an outtake from Music (2000). It begins with vocoder treated vocals over a bleeping synth, on a minor chord. Heavy drum hits stress the melody during the verse. [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] is written in common time with a moderately fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of C major with Madonna's voice spanning from B3 to C5. The song follows a basic sequence of C–Am–D–Am–A–E as its chord progression. Lyrically, she rejects tabloid culture's [...] "social disease", denouncing both TV and magazines.
