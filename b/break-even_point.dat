In 2010 the Department of Agriculture predicted farmers would receive an average of $1.35 per US gallon of cow's milk (35 cents per liter), which is down 30 cents per gallon from 2007 and below the <b>break-even</b> <b>point</b> for many cattle farmers.|$|E
25|$|The cathodes of {{some early}} 2007 {{lithium-ion}} batteries {{are made from}} lithium-cobalt metal oxide. This material is expensive, and cells made with it can release oxygen if overcharged. If the cobalt is replaced with iron phosphates, the cells will not burn or release oxygen under any charge. The price premium for early 2007 conventional hybrids is about US$5000, some US$3000 of which is for their NiMH battery packs. At early 2007 gasoline and electricity prices, that would mean a <b>break-even</b> <b>point</b> after six to ten years of operation. The conventional hybrid premium could fall to US$2000 in five years, with US$1200 or more of that being cost of lithium-ion batteries, providing for a three-year payback. The payback period may be longer for plug-in hybrids, because of their larger, more expensive batteries.|$|E

25|$|The {{additional}} electrical utilization {{required to}} recharge the plug-in vehicles could push many households {{in areas that}} do not have off-peak tariffs into the higher priced tier and negate financial benefits. Without an off-peak charging tariff, one study of a certain PHEV-20 model having an all-electric range of 20 miles, gasoline-fueled efficiency of 52.7mi/gal U.S., and all-electric efficiency of 4mi/kW·h, found that household electricity customers who consumed 131%–200% of baseline electricity at $0.220/(kW·h) would see benefits if gasoline was priced above US$2.89/US gal; those that consumed 201%–300% of baseline electricity at $0.303/(kW·h) would only see benefits if gas was priced above $3.98; and households consuming over 300% of baseline electricity at $0.346/(kW·h) would only see benefits if gasoline was priced above $4.55 (USD/gal). Off-peak tariff rates can lower the <b>break-even</b> <b>point.</b> The PG tariff would change those break-even gasoline prices to US$1.96, $3.17 and $3.80 per gallon, respectively, for the given PHEV and usage pattern in question.|$|E

A number of pattern cents were struck in 1854 and 1855. These featured various designs, including several depictions of Liberty and two adaptations of work by the late Mint chief engraver Christian Gobrecht: one showing a seated Liberty, which Gobrecht had placed on the silver coins in the 1830s, and another of a flying eagle, which Gobrecht had created based upon a sketch by Titian Peale.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{energy costs}} of running {{computer}} systems are a growing concern: for large data centers, recent estimates put these costs {{higher than the}} cost of hardware itself. As a consequence, energy efficiency has become a pervasive theme for designing, deploying, and operating computer systems. This paper evaluates the energy trade-offs brought by data deduplication in distributed storage systems. Depending on the workload, deduplication can enable a lower storage footprint, reduce the I/O pressure on the storage system, and reduce network traffic, at the cost of increased computational overhead. From an energy perspective, data deduplication enables a trade-off between the energy consumed for additional computation and the energy saved by lower storage and network load. The main point our experiments and model bring home is the following: while for non energy-proportional machines performance- and energy-centric optimizations have <b>break-even</b> <b>points</b> that are relatively close, for the newer generation of energy proportional machines the <b>break-even</b> <b>points</b> are significantly different. An important consequence of this difference is that, with newer systems, there are higher energy inefficiencies when the system is optimized for performance. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} {{of renewable energy}} systems poses major challenges on distribution grid operators. Because of the strong growth rates of the installation of photovoltaic (PV) and wind generators, huge needs for reinforcements in grids are expected. Next to conventional reinforcements (with additional and/or bigger dimensioned cables and transformers) also the introduction of decentralized storage systems seems to be promising. In this paper, an economical approach is presented enabling the calculation of <b>break-even</b> <b>points</b> for storage systems as a substitute to conventional grid reinforcements. The dynamic profitability calculation considers main influencing cost drivers for both alternatives, including operational and capital expenditures. Furthermore, the calculation of benefits of decentralized storage systems for upstream grid levels is also integrated. To enable these calculations, a storage model is derived oriented on battery characteristics to determine main requirements of a storage system {{to be able to}} integrate renewable energy systems. These elaborations are reflected on a real-world distribution grid faced with reinforcement needs due to the {{integration of}} PV. For this, measured data for the PV generator are integrated as well. The analysis reveal <b>break-even</b> <b>points</b> for the storage asset ranging between 100 and 500 € per kWh of installed capacity, depending on the lifetime of the storage asset and the costs for the substitute. Furthermore, main influencing parameters are evaluated using a sensitivity analysis. It is shown that the profitability can be increased significantly if not all peaks of PV generation need to be stored. Furthermore, the analysis of the operation for 1 [*]year indicates that a combined operation of the storage asset (not only oriented on grid objectives such as peak shaving, but considering also the objectives of further stakeholders such as energy traders) seems to be reasonable for increasing the profitability and incentivizing a larger market penetration of storage assets...|$|R
