5|$|Recent {{editions of}} the race have been decided with attacks on the Mur de Huy. The {{addition}} of the Côte de Cherave, however, added an unknown factor into the race: it was considered {{much more likely than}} in previous years that a group of riders could <b>break</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the peloton on the penultimate climb and hold an advantage to the finish line. No breakaway had won La Flèche Wallonne since 2003.|$|E
5|$|The Christmas Eve sermon only {{accelerated}} {{the departure of}} church members. A new branch, the United Church of God, was created in 1995 by a conference of departing ministers and named Tkach's one-time associate and former The World Tomorrow presenter, David Hulme, as president. It eventually became {{the largest of the}} groups to <b>break</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the WCG during this period. Although revenues continued to drop, Tkach remained steadfastly committed to the changes that he had implemented.|$|E

5|$|The {{competition}} {{formed as}} the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following {{the decision of}} clubs in the Football League First Division to <b>break</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Football League, {{which was founded in}} 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal. The deal was worth £1billion a year domestically as of 2013–14, with BSkyB and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively. The league generates €2.2billion per year in domestic and international television rights. In 2014–15, teams were apportioned revenues of £1,600 million, rising sharply to £2,400 million in 2016–17.|$|E

5|$|Andy Harries {{was born}} in Inverness, Scotland on 7 April 1954 {{and grew up in}} Peterborough, England, {{receiving}} primary education at West Town Primary School until 1961, and secondary education at the public Oakham School. He grew up aspiring to be a war correspondent in Vietnam, or an investigative journalist; his idols were Harold Evans, Jon Swain and John Pilger. He left college at the age of 17 with poor A Level results and became a trainee reporter on the Peterborough Evening Telegraph newspaper. His time on the newspaper raised his awareness of politics, and he sought to further his understanding of it by studying at university. He applied to various northern universities to <b>break</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> his southern middle-class lifestyle, and was accepted at Hull University.|$|E

5|$|Both models {{include an}} Apple A8 system-on-chip, and an M8 motion co-processor—an update of the M7 chip from the iPhone 5s. The primary {{difference}} between the M8 and the original M7 coprocessor is that the M8 also includes a barometer to measure altitude changes. Phil Schiller touted that the A8 chip would provide, {{in comparison to the}} 5s, a 25% increase in CPU performance, a 50% increase in graphics performance, and less heat output. Early hands-on reports suggested that the A8's GPU performance might indeed <b>break</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> previous generations doubling of performance at each yearly release, scoring 21204.26 in Base mark X compared to 20253.80, 10973.36 and 5034.75 on respectively the 5s, 5 and 4s.|$|E
5|$|De Lucía {{was widely}} {{considered}} to be the world's premier flamenco guitarist and by many to be Spain's greatest musical export. He had a revolutionary influence on flamenco music both as a composer and otherwise. His influence on flamenco guitar has been compared with that of Andrés Segovia's on classical guitar. His album Fuente y Caudal (Fountain and Flow) has been cited by many to have changed the world of flamenco guitar beyond traditional flamenco culture. Along with Enrique Morente and Camarón de la Isla, de Lucía was the first artist to <b>break</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> traditional flamenco and form what is now known as nuevo flamenco. As a composer, de Lucía was the first Spanish artist to mix jazz with Andalusian music in a more or less systematic way. This includes, but is not limited to, his collaborations with Di Meola, McLaughlin, and Pedro Iturralde.|$|E
5|$|The main {{legacy of}} the SSR Abkhazia is that it created, {{for the first time}} in modern history, a defined {{geographic}} entity under the name Abkhazia. The Abkhaz people were cognizant of their republic and its quasi-independent status, and though it was removed in 1931 they did not forget that it had existed. The SSR Abkhazia would take a prominent role during the glasnost and perestroika era of the late 1980s, as Abkhaz leaders called for their state to once again be formed and <b>break</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Georgia, citing the SSR Abkhazia as a precedent. This led to them restoring the 1925 SSR Abkhazian constitution, which ultimately led to the 1992–1993 war between Abkhazia and Georgia, and the modern Abkhaz–Georgian conflict.|$|E

5|$|Around 1730, the Baroque style {{gradually}} {{began to}} <b>break</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the defined Roman style of Baroque and gain {{an even stronger}} individuality, for two reasons: the rush to rebuild was subsiding, construction was becoming more leisurely and thoughtful; and a new clutch of home-grown Sicilian architects came to the forefront. This new generation had watched the rebuilding in the Baroque, and studied the ever more frequent engravings and architectural books and treatises arriving from the mainland. However, they were not like their predecessors (the former students of the Romans), and consequently were able to formulate strong individual styles of their own. They included Andrea Palma, Rosario Gagliardi and Tommaso Napoli. While taking account of the Baroque of Naples and Rome, they now adapted their designs for the local needs and traditions. Their use of resources and exploitation of the sites was often wildly inventive. Napoli and then Vaccarini had promoted {{the use of the}} external staircase, which was now taken to a new dimension: churches upon the summits of a hills would be reached by fantastical flights of steps evoking Vaccarini's mentor Francesco de Sanctis's Spanish Steps in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Despite Kỳ and Đức's media event, it {{appeared}} that Phát and Ton were remaining defiant after returning to the latter's 7th Division's headquarters in Mỹ Tho. Ton was apparently still maintaining a hostile political stance, and threatening to <b>break</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Saigon regime by overseeing the area around Mỹ Tho as a virtual independent state. Ton {{was reported to have}} threatened to cut the main highway from Saigon into Mỹ Tho and further south into the rest of the Mekong Delta, although it was thought he had no intention or means of assaulting Saigon militarily. Kỳ said a helicopter had been sent to arrest Ton but that a stand-off had developed. However, on September 16 Khánh had the plotters taken into custody. Đức, the rebel tank commander Nghia, Ton, and Lam were all arrested, followed by Phát, who returned to Saigon to turn himself in. A trial was then scheduled. Khánh removed three of the four corps commanders and six of the nine division commanders for failing to move against Phát and Đức.|$|E
5|$|Following Rösselsprung, the Germans moved Tirpitz to Bogenfjord near Narvik. By this time, {{the ship}} needed a major overhaul. Hitler had {{forbidden}} {{the ship to}} make the dangerous return to Germany, and so the overhaul was conducted in Trondheim. On 23 October, the ship left Bogenfjord and returned to Fættenfjord outside Trondheim. The defences of the anchorage were further strengthened; additional anti-aircraft guns were installed, and double anti-torpedo nets were erected around the vessel. The repairs were conducted in limited phases, such that Tirpitz would remain partially operational {{for the majority of}} the overhaul. A caisson was built around the stern to allow the replacement of the ship's rudders. During the repair process, the British attempted to attack the battleship with two Chariot human torpedoes, but before they could be launched, rough seas caused the human torpedoes to <b>break</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the fishing vessel which was towing them. By 28 December, the overhaul had been completed, and Tirpitz began sea trials. She conducted gunnery trials on 4 January 1943 in Trondheim Fjord. On 21 February, Topp was promoted to Rear Admiral and was replaced by Captain Hans Meyer; five days later the battleship Scharnhorst was ordered to reinforce the fleet in Norway. Vice Admiral Oskar Kummetz was given command of the warships stationed in Norway.|$|E

5|$|In December 1979, Roberts {{made good}} on his threats when he, {{along with the other}} top world {{championship}} riders, released a letter to the press announcing their intention to <b>break</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the FIM and create a rival race series called the World Series. When Roberts first arrived on the Grand Prix scene, motorcycle racers were competing for as little prize money as $200, at venues such as Imatra in Finland that featured railroad crossings and hay bales wrapped around telephone poles. In 1956, the reigning 500cc world champion, Geoff Duke and thirteen other riders were given six-month suspensions for merely threatening to strike. Roberts adopted a confrontational, sometimes belligerent stance with race promoters, challenging the previously accepted poor treatment that motorcycle racers of the day were accustomed to receiving. Although the competing series failed to take off due to difficulties in securing enough venues, it forced the FIM to take the riders' demands seriously and make changes regarding their safety. During the 1979 FIM Congress, new rules were passed increasing prize money substantially and in subsequent years, stricter safety regulations were imposed on race organizers.|$|E
5|$|On the February 27 Raw, Ziggler and Swagger unsuccessfully {{challenged}} Primo & Epico for the WWE Tag Team Championship in a Triple Threat tag team match, also involving Kofi Kingston and R-Truth. On the March 19 Raw, Ziggler and Swagger {{were announced}} as the newest members of Team Johnny for the 12-man tag team match at WrestleMania XXVIII {{and on the}} April 2 Raw, Ziggler and Swagger unsuccessfully challenged Santino Marella for the United States Championship in a triple threat match. After the match, Ziggler began a feud with Brodus Clay, who attacked Ziggler with a headbutt after he and Swagger tried to attack Marella. On the following episode of Raw, Ziggler and Swagger were defeated by Clay and Marella in a tag team match. In the following weeks, Ziggler and Swagger lost to Clay and Hornswoggle in singles and tag matches. At Extreme Rules, Ziggler was again defeated by Clay. In May, Ziggler and Swagger unsuccessfully challenged Kofi Kingston and R-Truth for WWE Tag Team Championship, first at Over the Limit and second on the May 28 episode of Raw, resulting in Ziggler showing signs of wanting to <b>break</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Guerrero and Swagger.|$|E
5|$|Tension between {{central and}} local {{government}} heightened in {{the final years of}} the Soviet Union's existence. On May 5, 1990, the New Armenian Army (NAA), a defense force envisioned to serve as a separate entity from the Soviet Union's military, was created. A celebration was planned for May 28, the anniversary of the creation of the first Armenian republic. However, on May 27 hostilities broke out between the NAA and the MVD troops based in Yerevan, resulting in the deaths of five Armenians in a shootout at the railway station. Witnesses claimed that the MVD had used an excessive amount of force in the firefight and insisted that it had instigated the fighting. Further firefights between Armenian militiamen and the MVD in nearby Sovetashen (now Nubarashen) resulted in the deaths of twenty-seven people and an indefinite cancellation of the May28 celebration. Armenia declared its sovereignty over Soviet laws on August 23, 1990. The reason Armenia's decision to <b>break</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Soviet Union largely stemmed from Moscow's intransigence on Karabakh, mishandling of the earthquake relief effort, and the shortcomings of the Soviet economy.|$|E

5|$|The opening {{match was}} another chapter in a long-running storyline {{between two of}} AAA's top Mini-Estrellas, Mascarita Sagrada and Espectrito, a storyline that {{actually}} predated the creation of AAA in 1992. The tecnico Sagrada and the rudo Espectrito had been booked as rivals {{from the beginning of}} Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre's (CMLL) Mini-Estrella division, as established by Antonio Peña when he worked for CMLL. Mascarita Sagrada defeated Espectrito in the tournament to determine the first-ever CMLL World Mini-Estrella Champion in what was one of the early highlights of their storyline feud. When Peña decided to <b>break</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> CMLL to create AAA, {{a large part of the}} Mini-Estrellas division left with him, including the champion Mascarita Sagrada and Espectrito, vacating the championship in the process. In AAA Peña got the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission to sanction the creation of the Mexican National Mini-Estrella Championship, a title that Espectrito won by defeating Mascarita Sagrada in the finals of a tournament.|$|E
5|$|Their fourth child, Claire, is {{delivered}} by {{a neighbor of}} the family in the lounge of their house as a hurricane is heading towards the Eastern Seaboard. The book follows the family through the 1960s and 1970s, as the children enter adolescence and discover themselves during the changing times of the 1960s and the Sexual Revolution. The Keane children, on entering early adulthood, begin to <b>break</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> their family and religious backgrounds. Jacob, the eldest child, serves in Vietnam and is killed in the French trenches. Michael moves away from Long Island and goes to study in a college in northern New York, but later turns to sex and drugs. Meanwhile, Annie, the bookworm of the family, leaves to study in England, but quickly changes her plans after meeting a man on a bus whom she likes. Claire, the youngest, returns from a summer vacation to her former Catholic high school, showing a changed personality and increased self-confidence.|$|E
5|$|According to Sugiura, Monolith Soft's {{relations}} with Namco {{had undergone a}} negative change after Nakamura retired as head of Namco in 2002, three years before the merger with Bandai. The company underwent changes and Monolith Soft felt they were being given less creative freedom, and the newly-created Namco Bandai was less willing to take creative risks. The company then received consultation from Shinji Hatano, an executive director at Nintendo, who advised them to continue creating innovative projects. Spurred on by Hatano's supportive attitude, Monolith Soft decided to <b>break</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Namco Bandai to become a Nintendo subsidiary; this provided Monolith Soft creative freedom in exchange for software development exclusivity for Nintendo platforms. Nintendo's purchasing {{of the majority of}} Monolith Soft's shares from Bandai Namco Holdings was publicly announced in April 2007. Nintendo became the majority shareholder of Monolith Soft with 80% of shares, while Bandai Namco retained 16% and remained as a development partner. Namco Bandai stated that the exchange of Monolith Soft shares would strengthen their relationship with Nintendo. The remaining shares were divided between Takahashi, Sugiura and Honne. Nintendo's acquisition of Monolith Soft contrasted against the company's previous publicized approach of not taking part in mergers and acquisitions of other studios and companies. In a statement on the matter, then-CEO of Nintendo Satoru Iwata said that the deal was initiated due to the positive relations between Sugiura and Nintendo, and the two company's parallel design and development philosophies.|$|E
