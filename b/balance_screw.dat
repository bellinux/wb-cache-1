50|$|Early watches used a {{solid steel}} balance. As {{temperature}} increased, the solid balance expanded in size, changing {{the moment of}} inertia and changing {{the timing of the}} watch. In addition, the hairspring would lengthen, decreasing its spring constant. This problem was initially solved through the use of the compensation balance. The compensation balance consisted of a ring of steel sandwiched to a ring of brass. These rings were then split in two places. The balance would, at least theoretically, actually decrease in size with heating to compensate for the lengthening of the hairspring. Through careful adjustment of the placement of the <b>balance</b> <b>screws</b> (brass or gold screws placed in the rim of the balance), a watch could be adjusted to keep time the same at both hot (100 °F) and cold (32°) temperatures. Unfortunately, a watch so adjusted would run slow at temperatures between these two. The problem was completely solved through the use of special alloys for the balance and hairspring which were essentially immune to thermal expansion. Such an alloy is used in Hamilton's 992E and 992B.|$|R
5000|$|John Birch's guitar pickups had {{a unique}} {{construction}} {{compared to other}} pickups of the time. Normally, pickups use Alnico or Ceramic magnets, occasionally Samarium-Cobalt, as in Bill Lawrence's Fender SCN pickups, or even Neodymium, as in Q-Tuner's bass pickups. Birch used cobalt steel magnets, oversized {{to make up for}} their relative weakness as compared to Alnico. However, there are Magnum, Hyperflux, Multiflux and Biflux pickups with smaller Alnico magnets. (J1 Hyperflux/Biflux, J1 Magnum/Biflux and J2 Multiflux, built 1977, these guitars were all built shortly after John Diggins left JBG in 1977.) He also used much finer copper wire than most other pickups because finer wire allows more wire to be wound on the bobbins, which results in a more powerful sound. Finer than normal wire also accentuates high frequencies, though fine wire can have a [...] "thin" [...] sound if not compensated for in other ways, such as higher resistance, shorter coils, or more metal in the magnetic field to raise inductance. Also, he potted the pickups in black epoxy (the 1977 pickups with the alnico magnets were all potted with a cream-coloured epoxy) to fight microphonic feedback caused by unwanted vibrations of the copper wire. The epoxy keeps the wire from moving. The covers to the pickups were stainless steel. Finally, Birch used a row of 9 instead of 6 <b>balance</b> <b>screws</b> as polepieces to create a broader area for the pickup to sense the vibrating string. With Fender single coils or Gibson humbuckers, the strings each have an individual polepiece. However, if the player bends a string, that string can move over an area where there is no pole, and the sound will get weaker.|$|R
5000|$|The Mark 3 Experimental was a 30 caliber {{gun that}} used {{trunnions}} and had 11 hoops with the outer hoop starting [...] from the breech and running {{out to the}} muzzle. The Mark 3s consisted of gun Nos. 9 - 27, 33 - 37, and 51. The production Mark 3 Mod 0 had removable trunnions, [...] from the breech, 35 caliber gun that had 11 hoops with the outer hoop starting 4 inches from the breech and running out to [...] from the muzzle. This gun was removed from service prior to World War I. The Mark 3 Mod 1 was constructed of tube, jacket and eight hoops while Mod 2 was identical to Mod 1 but with different steps under the chase hoops. Mod 3 was, for one gun, lengthened to 40 calibers and was removed from service {{prior to the start}} of World War I. Mod 4 was, also for one gun only, different from other Mods in having a ring shrunk onto the breech end, tapering the breech, and with a small <b>balancing</b> hoop <b>screwed</b> onto the front chase hoop. Mod 5 had the trunnions removed and the outer jacket threaded to accept a sleeve. Mod 6, gun Nos. 52 and 82 - 83, were constructed of nickel-steel in a simplified three-piece construction.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{gives the}} brief out line about the {{worldwide}} production cottonseed & its oil, CSO properties, its comparison with diesel and jatropha biodiesel. This paper also investigates {{the performance of}} a diesel engine using diesel fuel and cottonseed oil (CSO) biodiesel in terms of brake thermal efficiency and indicated thermal efficiency for conventional diesel, cottonseed oil, as well as for jatropha oil. For this aim, A Single Cylinder, 4 -stroke vertical, watercooled, self-governed diesel engine developing 5 HP at 1500 rpm (Rope brake dynamometer with spring <b>balances</b> and loading <b>screw.</b> Brake drum diameter = 0. 400 m.) engine is selected for the testing with diesel fuel and neat biodiesel, which is cottonseed oil methyl ester, at full load conditions. The evaluation of theoretical data showed that the brake thermal efficiency and indicated thermal efficiency of CSO biodiesel was slightly higher than that of diesel fuel and jatropha oil. This study reveals that the use of cottonseed oil biodiesel improves the performance parameters of CI engine compared to conventional diesel fuel.

5000|$|All Lange watches contain {{mechanical}} {{rather than}} quartz movements and, {{with the exception}} of a very few special edition watches, Lange watch cases are made of yellow gold, rose gold, white gold, or platinum. Lange movements are developed, produced, and assembled by Lange itself. Lange's movement design and decoration is distinctively Glashütte in appearance, eschewing typically Swiss features, such as multiple bridges and cocks, or pearlage, in favor of three-quarter plates, [...] "Glashütte stripes", hand-engraved <b>balance</b> cocks and <b>screwed</b> gold chatons. Lange movements are made from a metal known as German silver, as opposed to the plated brass typically used for Swiss movements. Lange watches tend to have a distinctive appearance. For example, the [...] "Lange 1" [...] model features an asymmetric layout with no overlap among its key indicators: a dial displaying the hours and minutes, a smaller subsidiary dial displaying seconds, an oversized double window date display, and a power reserve indicator. Lange's watches are often described as more [...] "austere" [...] or [...] "Teutonic" [...] in appearance than watches produced by comparable Swiss firms.|$|R
60|$|The Dollar is {{hunted down}} {{in all sorts}} of ways; the Christian-Science Mother-Church and Bargain-Counter in Boston peddles all kinds of spiritual wares to the faithful, always at extravagant prices, and always on the one condition--cash, cash in advance. The Angel of the Apocalypse could not go there and get a copy of his own pirated book on credit. Many, many {{precious}} Christian-Science things are to be had there--for cash: Bible Lessons; Church Manual; C.S. Hymnal; History of the building of the Mother-Church; lot of Sermons; Communion Hymn, 'Saw Ye My Saviour,' by Mrs. Eddy, half a dollar a copy, 'words used by special permission of Mrs. Eddy.' Also we have Mrs. Eddy's and the Angel's little Bible-Annex in eight styles of binding at eight kinds of war-prices: among these a sweet thing in 'levant, divinity circuit, leather lined to edge, round corners, gold edge, silk sewed, each, prepaid, $6,' and if you take a million you get them a shilling cheaper--that is to say, 'prepaid, $5.75.' Also we have Mrs. Eddy's 'Miscellaneous Writings,' at noble big prices, the divinity-circuit style heading the extortions, shilling discount where you take an edition. Next comes 'Christ and Christmas,' by the fertile Mrs. Eddy--a poem--I would God I could see it--price $3, cash in advance. Then follow five more books by Mrs. Eddy at highwaymen's rates, as usual, some of them in 'leatherette covers,' some of them in 'pebbled cloth,' with divinity circuit, compensation <b>balance,</b> twin <b>screw,</b> and the other modern improvements: and at the same bargain counter can be had the 'Christian Science Journal.' I wish it were in refined taste to apply a rudely and ruggedly descriptive epithet to that literary slush-bucket, so as to give one an accurate idea of what it is like. I am moved to do it, but I must not: it is better to be refined than accurate when one is talking about a production like that.|$|R
40|$|The classic {{approach}} to calculating the {{power has been}} through a torque <b>balance</b> for the <b>screw</b> multiplied by screw speed[1 - 5]. The torque is calculated through an assumed stress model. Some models assume constant viscosity[1 - 3], and many are two-dimensional[2 - 6]. The influence of the flight clearance is demonstrated[2, 3], {{and the effects of}} flight clearance and temperature are shown with finite difference methods for two-dimensional flow of power-law viscosity[5]. A macro-energy equation is used to discuss power and heat, but details of quantifying calculations are not presented[6]. This final approach is basic to the starting point of this work. Math Model Energy Balance The conservation of energy for a single barrel zone (Figure 1) of the melt section is assumed to be similar to that of a heat exchanger but with internal heat generation. The melt flows axially through the screw channel and exchanges heat with the barrel. The temperature of the melt changes to account for its heat loss or gain. The screw may also perform pumping work against external pressure. The power to the screw is then given by the conservation of energy as follows: (1) Melt Temperature The crux of the solution to equation 1 is the melt temperature, T (z). This has been previously modeled[7] with viscosity given by. (2) The resulting governing equation for the melt temperature in dimensionless form is given[7] a...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. In this work, eco-fuel {{briquettes}} {{made from}} a mixture of 32 % spent coffee grounds, 23 % coal fines, 11 % saw dust, 18 % mielie husks, 10 % waste paper and 6 % paper pulp contaminated water, respectively were investigated. Various processing stages such as briquetting, drying, combustion and flue gas emissions were investigated in order to evaluate the socio-economic viability of the batch production of eco-fuel briquettes from biomass waste material. Each stage was studied independently {{in order to develop}} basic models that contained material and energy <b>balances.</b> A <b>screw</b> press briquetting machine was designed and fabricated as part of this work to be tested against the legacy foundation Porta press, and the Bikernmayer hand brick press. The compaction of the biomass waste material into briquettes follows the principle of physical interlocking of the fine particles within the plant fibres, natural material binding due to released cellulose content, as well as reduction in porosity, due to a simultaneous dewatering and compaction action. The processing variables such as cycle times and pressure were studied. The Bikernmayer press is preferred as it produced briquettes of higher bulk densities and lower moisture content as compared to the other presses. The drying was investigated in a laboratory scale convective dryer to establish typical convection parameters. A drying system that utilizes produced briquettes as a heating medium is proposed, and here drying will be effected over a refractory brick fireplace by means of convection and radiation. A basic model was set up to include radiation with the convection to predict a drying time of 4. 8 hours. The combustion of briquettes was investigated using a POCA ceramic stove linked to the testo Portable Emission Analyzer System. This enabled an air-to-fuel ratio of 1. 44 and a burning rate of 2 g per minute to be established. The energy transfer efficiency for boiling a pot of water was found to be 85 %. The gas emissions were found to be within the acceptable limits, as set out by OSHA. A standard initial economic evaluation was performed based on a briquette selling price of R 2. 26 per kilogram for the ease of accommodating the local market. The financial model for both Porta press and screw press were not economically viable, as their running costs were greater than the gross project revenues. For the Bikernmayer conceptual model, with a total capital investment of R 669, 981 + VAT (this includes one year operating cost) and a project life of five years, the gross Process parameters and conditions batch production of eco-fuel briquettes profit margin is 44 %, the profitability index is 5. 33 and the internal Rate of return 31. 44 %. The net present value and return period are R 676, 896 and 0. 408 years respectively. The customer profile as currently at hand is 17 % of the selected area within 80 m radius from production site. The remaining 83 % will be in need of energy as they become aware of the new product offering. The selling of the briquettes should be accompanied by an education process, to avoid the dangers of heating indoors. The principal driver for this project is socio economic development and it is being strengthened by Eskom’s inability to provide sufficient energy. A secondary driver is the global drive to reduce emissions and fossil fuel usage; this technology does exactly this whilst diverting waste from landfill. In the Polokwane declaration (2008), it is stated that South Africa will have no calorific waste to landfill by 2014. Hence legislation will also provide {{a major part of the}} drive...|$|R
