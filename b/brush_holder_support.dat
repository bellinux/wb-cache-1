50|$|The {{softness}} of carbon brushes permits direct radial end-contact with the commutator without {{damage to the}} segments, permitting easy reversal of rotor direction, without the need to reorient the <b>brush</b> <b>holders</b> for operation in the opposite direction. Although never reversed, common appliance motors that use wound rotors, commutators and brushes have radial-contact brushes. In {{the case of a}} reaction-type carbon <b>brush</b> <b>holder,</b> carbon <b>brushes</b> may be reversely inclined with the commutator so that the commutator tends to push against the carbon for firm contact.|$|R

50|$|Modern devices using {{carbon brushes}} {{usually have a}} {{maintenance-free}} design that requires no adjustment throughout {{the life of the}} device, using a fixed-position <b>brush</b> <b>holder</b> slot and a combined brush-spring-cable assembly that fits into the slot.

50|$|A {{spring is}} {{typically}} {{used with the}} brush, to maintain constant contact with the commutator. As the brush and commutator wear down, the spring steadily pushes the brush downwards towards the commutator. Eventually the brush wears small and thin enough that steady contact {{is no longer possible}} or it is no longer securely held in the <b>brush</b> <b>holder,</b> and so the brush must be replaced.|$|R

5000|$|The bifuricated {{shape for}} a writing device was first {{proposed}} and patented by John WyttenBach in 1886. [...] Several other iterations arose including The Pen and <b>Brush</b> <b>Holder</b> of Dwight B. Smith and the Penholder by George Cooper Ward.

50|$|When a commutated motor or {{generator}} uses {{more power}} than a single brush is capable of conducting, an assembly of several <b>brush</b> <b>holders</b> is mounted in parallel {{across the surface of}} the very large commutator.

The brush is placed inside the Handi Sani so that when the toilet is flushed, the attachment fills up with clean water while simultaneously draining the dirty water into the toilet bowl.|$|R
40|$|Embodiments of {{the present}} {{invention}} are directed to a simple apparatus and a convenient and accurate method of mounting the components to form an off-axis reflective optical apparatus such as a collimator. In one embodiment, an off-axis reflective optical apparatus comprises a mounting block having a ferrule <b>holder</b> <b>support</b> surface and an off-axis reflector support surface which is generally perpendicular to the ferrule <b>holder</b> <b>support</b> surface. An optical reflector is mounted on the off-axis reflector support surface and has a reflected beam centerline. The optical reflector has a conic reflective surface and a conic center. A ferrule holder is mounted on the ferrule <b>holder</b> <b>support</b> surface. The ferrule holder provides a ferrule for coupling to an optical fiber and orienting a fiber tip of the optical fiber along a fiber axis toward the optical reflector. The fiber axis is nonparallel to the reflected beam centerline. Prior to mounting the optical reflector to the off-axis reflector support surface and prior to mounting the ferrule holder to the ferrule <b>holder</b> <b>support</b> surface, the optical reflector is movable on the off-axis reflector surface and the ferrule holder is movable on the ferrule <b>holder</b> <b>support</b> surface to align the conic center of the optical reflector {{with respect to the}} fiber tip of the optical fiber, and the apparatus has {{at least one of the}} following features: (1) the optical reflector is movable on the off-axis reflector support surface to adjust a focus of the fiber tip with respect to the optical reflector, and (2) the ferrule holder is movable on the ferrule <b>holder</b> <b>support</b> surface to adjust the focus of the fiber tip with respect to the optical reflector...|$|R

50|$|The unfired {{porcelain}} body is {{not very}} plastic but vessel forms have been made from it. Donnelly lists the following types of product: figures, boxes, vases and jars, cups and bowls, fishes, lamps, cup-stands, censers and flowerpots, animals, <b>brush</b> <b>holders,</b> wine and teapots, Buddhist and Taoist figures, secular figures and puppets. There was a large output of figures, especially religious figures, e.g., Guanyin, Maitreya, Luohan and Ta-mo figures. Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy, was particularly revered in Fujian and there exist innumerable figures of her. Donnelly says, “There {{is no doubt that}} figures constitute the great glory of blanc de Chine.” Some have been produced with little modification from the late 16th or early 17th century. Crisply modeled figures with a smooth white glaze were popular as were joss-stick <b>holders,</b> <b>brush</b> pots, Dogs of Fo, libation cups and boxes.|$|R

40|$|Ever {{since its}} development, the {{induction}} motor has been mainly used for constant speed application. Three phase squirrel cage induction motors {{have been widely}} preferred due to simplicity, robustness and maintenance free operation. However, in variable speed applications, preference is always given to dc motors. The reason for using separately exited dc motor as a variable speed drives is the simplicity in control as {{the field and the}} armature current are electrically decoupled from each other. However the main problem with dc motor is the maintenance of commutators, <b>brushes</b> and <b>brush</b> <b>holders.</b> The rapid developments in power electronics and powerful digital signal processor (DSPs) have made the implementation of new control schemes possible to realiz...|$|R

50|$|Like {{his successors}} after him, the company founder Ludwig Schunk {{endeavored}} {{to expand and}} shore up his company through diversification into related fields of technology. To that end, he in 1923 acquired a carbon <b>brush</b> <b>holder</b> factory and integrated it into his operations in Heuchelheim. In 1932 the production of sintered bearings was started. The carbon orientation had already previously been expanded with products for mechanical applications. The increasingly difficult economic environment could not prevent Ludwig Schunk's life work from advancing. As the Reichsmark lost ever more of its value and the concomitant heavy inflation increased as well, Schunk successfully sought new sales markets abroad from which stable currency flowed in. By boosting his export business he succeeded in avoiding losses of real assets for his company.|$|R

50|$|The early 1990s {{recession}} severely {{affected the}} company, especially in its main market, Europe. The difficult situation led to Groupe Pechiney to seek divest of Carbone Lorraine's stock. In 1995, Pechiney sold a 21 percent stake to Paribas Affaires Industrielles. Carbone Lorraine was starting {{the recovery process}} and in the following years strengthened its electrical components sector by purchasing UGIMAG and Dietrich of Germany, which converted it in the European leader in electric motor's <b>brush</b> <b>holders.</b> During the next years, {{the expansion of the}} company continued, with the acquisitions of ferrite magnet divisions of Philips and ITT-Automotive and the American corrosion resistant materials' manufacturer Autocosmos. At the same time, Paribas sold its shares and the company became independent, with a large percentage of its stock on free float.

5000|$|Twin Pagodas (Chinese:苏州双塔) {{lie in the}} Dinghui Temple Lane in {{the southeastern}} corner of the city proper of Suzhou. They are artistic and natural as they are close at hand.

It is charming that the {{exquisite}} and straight Twin Pagoda look like two inserted writing brushes. There was originally a single-storey house with three rooms just like a writing <b>brush</b> <b>holder</b> with the shadows of the two pagodas reclining on its roof at sunset. To the east of the pagoda is a square five-storeyed bell building built in the Ming Dynasty which is exactly like a thick ink stick.

In 1932 sinter metal production was started with sintering bearings. After the death of Ludwig Schunk in 1947, the estate of the founder, who had not had any children, passed to the [...] "Providential Fund" [...] of Schunk+Ebe oHG. In 1948 and 1949 a construction program was set up to expand the operation from 500 to 1200 employees. There followed in 1956 the incorporation of Schunk & Ebe S.A. in Brussels, the first foreign subsidiary. At present, Schunk is represented in Europe with 46 operating companies. In 1957 Schunk Electro Carbón S.A. de C.V. was incorporated in Mexico, becoming the first company on the American continent. In 1969 there followed the founding of the Brazilian company Schunk do Brasil Ltda. in São Paulo.|$|R
