40|$|We have {{recorded}} fluorescence spectra {{of the atomic}} rubidium D-lines {{in the presence of}} several hundreds of <b>bars</b> <b>buffer</b> gas pressure. With additional saturation broadening a spectral linewidth comparable to the thermal energy of the atoms in the heated gas cell is achieved. An intensity-dependent blue asymmetry of the spectra is observed, which becomes increasingly pronounced when extrapolating to infinitely high light intensity. We interpret our results as evidence for the dressed (coupled atom-light) states to approach thermal equilibrium. Comment: 4 page...|$|R

Two express trains travelling in opposite directions then hit the wreckage. Two passengers were killed and the 17 injured were taken to hospital.

30|$|Doxorubicin has {{intrinsic}} fluorescence, {{which can}} be used to compare the fluorescence of the doxorubicin alginate nanoparticles (NALG-DOX) to a standard curve of DOX to estimate its concentration. We used excitation/emission wavelengths of 470 / 550  nm. Release of doxorubicin from NALG-DOX solutions was determined by dialyzing the final filtered nanoparticle solution into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 or citrate buffer at pH 5.5. Two sets of five batches of NALG-DOX were prepared as described previously, with an initial DOX concentration of 1.25  mg/mL in the aqueous alginate phase. Eighteen Slide-A-Lyzer MINI Dialysis devices (ThermoFisher) with an inner volume of 100  μL and a molecular weight cutoff of 2  kDa were prepared by adding 100  μL of NALG-DOX to each device. Each device was placed in a scintillation vial containing 20  mL of <b>buffer.</b> A stir <b>bar</b> was added to each buffer-containing vial, and all vials were placed on a stir plate for gentle agitation {{for the duration of the}} experiment. The vials were covered to reduce loss of the buffer to evaporation, and to protect from light. At each time point (1, 2, 4, 24, 48, 72  h), three devices were removed, 100  μL of the sample was removed from each device and placed in a separate well, and a fluorescence measurement was made on a Tecan Infinite M 200 Pro microplate reader (Tecan Trading AG) at 470 / 550  nm. The fluorescence measurements were compared to measurements from a standard curve and initial aliquots taken before the experiment to determine the concentration and the amount of loss of DOX to the buffer.|$|R
40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. At the University of Twente, a 14. 5 K hydrogen-based {{sorption}} cooler {{is under}} development. It {{can be used}} as a stand-alone 14. 5 K cooler, or as a precooler, e. g., in combination with a 4 K heliumbased sorption cooler. The advantage of sorption coolers is the absence of moving parts and, as a result, their vibration-free operation and, potentially, a very long life. A 4. 5 K helium-based sorption- cooler stage was developed and built under a previous ESA-TRP contract, and in 2008, a new ESA-sponsored project was started aimed at the development of a hydrogen cooler stage. A demonstrator cooler has been designed that is able to provide 40 mW of cooling at 14. 5 K. It requires an input of 5. 6 W of electric power to a sorption compressor that uses a 90 K radiator as a heat sink. The required radiator area is 1. 9 m 2. The compressor contains two stages consisting of cells filled with activated carbon. The cells are thermally cycled between the heat-sink level of 90 K and about 210 K, causing hydrogen to be periodically adsorbed and desorbed. As a result, hydrogen is pumped from a low-pressure buffer at 0. 1 bar to a medium-pressure <b>buffer</b> at 4 <b>bar,</b> and subsequently to the high-pressure side of the cold stage at 50 bar. The flow direction in this process is controlled by passive valves. In the cold stage the working fluid is precooled by a 50 K radiator (0. 1 m 2). In this paper, the design of the hydrogen-based sorption cooler is discussed along with breadboard tests on system components. Tests of the effect of gravity on a cold stage running at 14. 5 K are included...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} time series {{analysis}} has drawn significant attentions in recent years, since it is of tremendous interest to practitioners, {{as well as to}} academic researchers, to make statistical inferences and forecasts of future values of the interested variables. To do forecasting, parametric models are often required to describe the patterns of the observed data set. In order to describe data adequately, such statistical models should be established based on fundamental principles. Two threshold-type time series models, the <b>buffered</b> threshold autoregressive (<b>BAR)</b> model and the threshold moving-average (TMA) model are studied in this thesis. The most important contribution of this thesis is the extension of the classical threshold models via regime switching mechanisms that exhibit hysteresis to a new model called the buffered threshold model. For this type of new models, there is a buffer zone for the regime switching mechanism. The self-exciting buffered threshold autoregressive model has been thoroughly studied: a sufficient condition is given for the geometric ergodicity of the two-regime BAR process; the conditional least squares estimation is considered for the parameter estimation of the BAR model, and asymptotic properties including strong consistency and asymptotic distributions of the least square estimators are also derived. Monte Carlo experiments are conducted to give further support to the methodology developed for the new model. Two empirical examples are used to demonstrate the importance of the BAR model. Potential extensions for the basic buffer processes are discussed as well. Such extensions are expected to follow the development of classical threshold model and are motivated by their relationships with phenomena in the physical sciences. The proposed buffer process is more general than the classical threshold model, and it should be able to capture more nonlinear features exhibited by this nonlinear world than its predecessor. Although the theoretical understanding of the model is still at its infancy, it is believed that the buffer process will provide both researchers and practitioners with a useful tool to understand the nonlinear world. Moreover, some statistical properties of the threshold moving-average models are studied. Computer simulations have been extensively used, and some mathematical interpretation is attempted in the light of some existing research works. The model-building procedure for the TMA models is also reviewed. The effectiveness of some classical information criteria in selecting the correct TMA model is studied. A goodness-of-fit test is derived which would be useful in diagnostic checking the fitted TMA models. published_or_final_versionStatistics and Actuarial ScienceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Friday 15 th April, 2016 (view commits) "I gotta {{have more}} cowbell!" - The Bruce Dickinson The main feature in this release is the {{completely}} new sample system {{for working with}} large folders of samples. You can now easily index into and filter over whole folders of samples with a simple yet powerful filter system. This system has been in development {{for over a year}} now and has been tuned and tweaked over many performances and practice sessions. See the documentation and examples for sample as well as the new tutorial section 3. 7 for details. We also have a number of exciting new sounds to play with including some beautifully sounding chiptune synths, fun retro FX and new drum samples including a full tabla set and a cowbell. Finally, even more boot issues on both OS X and Windows that have been fixed making this the most polished and stable release to date. Now go and get your live code on! Breaking Changes use_sample_pack_as and with_sample_pack_as have been removed. A synth opt value of nil now no longer resolves to 0. 0. Instead it masks any defaults and ensures the downstream default (for the actual synthdef itself) is honoured. This allows you to override any existing synth defaults specified via use_synth_defaults for a given synth trigger. Default schedule ahead time is now 0. 5 s on all platforms for consistency (except for Raspberry Pi 1 which remains at 1 s). New Fns current_random_seed - Get the current seed value of the random generator. set_cent_tuning! - global tuning. on - similar to if but behaves the same as the on: opt for synths and samples. halves - create a ring of successive halves. doubles - create a ring of successive doubles. pick - similar to shuffle but allows duplicates. You may also specify how many items to pick. fx_names - create a ring of all available FX. Synths & FX New synth :dtri - detuned triangle waves. New synth :pluck - a lovely synthesised plucked string. New synth :chiplead - retro NES style lead synth. New synth :chipbass - retro NES style bass synth. New synth :chipnoise - retro NES style noise synth. New FX :whammy - low-tech transposition effect similar to the Digitech Whammy guitar pedal. New FX :octaver - low-tech octave effect similar to early guitar pedals. New FX :vowel - modifies incoming signal to match human vowel sounds. New FX :mono - mono effect for summing stereo channels. :tanh FX is now more crunchy by default. :compressor and :krush FX now correctly honour the mix: opt. Samples Samples in FLAC format (Free Lossless Audio Codec) are now supported! The sample fn gained source and filter pre-opts. You may now specify a number of parameters directly before the opts which describe both folders containing samples and filters over those folders to allow you to easily and quickly work with large sample sets. See Section 3. 7 of the tutorial for more information. Samplers now have hpf: and lpf: opts. Any cutoff: opts are automatically switched to lpf: and any errors will be reported with an lpf: prefix. The sampler synth gained a compressor enabled via the compress: opt. This means you can now compress any triggered sample directly without the need to reach for an FX. Samplers gained the pre_amp: opt which applies the amp at the beginning of its internal signal chain. You can use this to overload the new compressor. Samplers now have both high pass and low pass filter envelopes which behave similarly to the amplitude envelope but control internal hpf and lpf FX. These are available via new opts which mirror the standard envelope opts but with a hpf_ and lpf_ prefix (such as hpf_attack, lpf_decay_level and friends). Passing a directory path to load_samples will now load all the samples within that directory. Passing a directory path to free_samples will now free all the loaded samples within that directory. Samples are now loaded asynchronously in a separate thread. This therefore doesn't block the current thread and cause any subsequent synth/sample triggers to be late. Sample trigger logging now includes the directory of the contained sample. Samples are now reloaded asynchronously after a server reboot (and therefore no longer block execution). Add new :tabla_ sample group with a range of tabla drum sounds. Add new :vinyl_ sample group with a range of vinyl scratches and hisses. Add new samples: :drum_cowbell, :drum_roll, :misc_cros, :misc_cineboom, :perc_swash, :perc_till, :loop_safari, :loop_tabla. GUI Add new preference to enforce strict synth/FX timing. When enabled synths and samples no longer trigger if it is too late - instead they are silent and print a warning message. This behaviour ensures samples or synths are never triggered out of time. New load button which will load the contents of a file into the current <b>buffer.</b> The vertical <b>bars</b> which help visualise nesting now render in a contiguous fashion over blank lines. C-k now nukes over trailing whitespace. load_sample now has sample autocompletion. GUI now correctly reports if the host is a Raspberry Pi 3. New editor preference - Log Auto Scroll. When enabled will always scroll log to the bottom after printing every new message. Whitespace at top and bottom of buffer is no longer trimmed. Hitting RETURN now auto-indents the buffer - ensuring that the cursor is moved to the correct indentation on the following line. Added Chinese Simplified GUI translation. Log visibility now correctly matches GUI preference. Documentation New tutorial section 3. 7 on Sample Pack Filters. New appendix sections. Examples for sample fn have been completely rewritten and extended. Improvements scale and chord can now handle being passed no tonic such as: (chord :minor) which will return a ring of offsets from 0. chord learned new variants: add 2, add 4, add 9, add 11, add 13, madd 2, madd 4, madd 9, madd 11, madd 13 The ring's. take method can now take more elements than the original ring by wrapping around: (ring 1, 2, 3). take(5) #=> (ring 1, 2, 3, 1, 2) Rings may now be added or subtracted from each other e. g. (ring 1, 2, 3) + (ring 4) #=> (ring 1, 2, 3, 4) Adding or subtracting a number from a ring will create a new ring with the number added or subtracted from each of the original ring's elements: (ring 1, 2, 3) - 1 #=> (ring 0. 0, 1. 0, 2. 0) Calling (ring 1, 2, 3). take(0) will now return an empty ring. density now complains if it isn't passed a do/end block. Improve error messages for use/with_synth when accidentally passed opts. Bugfixes On OS X only raise an error on boot if it's clear the sound card's in and out rates are different. Improve robustness of boot process on Windows. Rest notes are no longer printed if synth logging is disabled. No longer apply synth defaults to FX. You may now control opts that have no associated info (previously it would raise a 'not modulatable' error). Fix index lookup of Vectors. Fix C-i doc lookup shortcut to work with :tb 303 synth docs. C-i now always displays docs where available (previously it was possible for docs not to be displayed). Sliding between chords now works correctly Windows version will now boot mutiple networked machines logged in with the same account...|$|R
