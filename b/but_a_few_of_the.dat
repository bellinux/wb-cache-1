The match results were compiled into a 'Merit Table', with teams playing more than three games eligible for the championshipthe first champions were the London Ravens, who won all ten of their matches. Hundreds of clubs have since been formed, playing both full contact football and flag football at senior, university and youth level.

5|$|At 16:02, {{still waiting}} for a {{definitive}} report on {{the location of the}} Japanese fleet carriers, the U.S. carriers' radar detected the first incoming wave of Japanese strike aircraft. Fifty-three F4F-4 Wildcat fighters from the two U.S. carriers were directed by radar control towards the attackers. However, communication problems, limitations of the aircraft identification capabilities of the radar, primitive control procedures, and effective screening of the Japanese dive bombers by their escorting Zeros, prevented all <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. fighters from engaging the Vals before they began their attacks on the U.S. carriers. Just before the Japanese dive bombers began their attacks, Enterprise and Saratoga cleared their decks for the impending action by launching the aircraft that they had been holding ready in case the Japanese fleet carriers were sighted. These aircraft were told to fly north and attack anything they could find, or else to circle outside the battle zone, until it was safe to return.|$|E

5|$|Holmenkolbanen had {{built-up}} large debts {{in building}} the underground section to Nationaltheatret, including large amounts of compensation to house-owners who had their buildings damaged during construction. To finance their debt, the Akersbanerne-owned Smestad Line was transferred to Holmenkolbanen on 16 November 1933, with Akersbanerene taking over the majority of shares in Holmenkolbanen. The latter remained listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. From 4 January 1937, Bærumsbanen took over the operation of trams on the Østensjø Line, though the ownership of the line remained with Akersbanerne. Oslo Sporveier started operating trolleybus lines from 1939. On 1 October 1944, Oslo Sporveier bought Bærumsbanen and took over {{the operation of the}} Lillaker and Østensjø Lines. On 1 January 1948, the municipalities of Oslo and Aker merged, and on 31 May 1949, the two municipally-owned companies, Oslo Sporveier and Akersbanerne, merged, taking the name of Oslo Sporveier. The following year, Oslo Sporveier took over Ekebergbanen. In 1975, Oslo Sporveier bought all <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shares in Holmenkolbanen, {{and at the same time}} took over operation of all the suburban lines.|$|E
5|$|The Johnson County War, {{with its}} overtones of class warfare {{coupled with the}} {{intervention}} ordered by the President of the United States to {{save the lives of}} a gang of hired killers and set them free, is not a flattering reflection on the American myth of the west. The Johnson County War {{has been one of the}} best-known range wars of the frontier. It has been a popular feature of the Western genre of fiction, which includes literature, films and television shows. The Banditti of the Plains, written in 1894 by witness Asa Shinn Mercer, is the earliest record of the Johnson County War. The book was suppressed for many years by the WSGA, who seized and destroyed all <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first edition copies from the 1894 printing; they were rumored to have hijacked and destroyed the second printing as it was being shipped from a printer north of Denver, Colorado. The book was reprinted several times in the 20th century and most recently in 2015. Frances McElrath's novel 1902 The Rustler, took inspiration from the Johnson County War, and was sympathetic to the perspective of the small ranchers.|$|E

25|$|Arriving in Santa Fe in October, General Kearny had {{dispatched}} Captain (now Lieutenant Colonel) Philip St. George Cooke, West Point {{class of}} 1827, to assume {{command of the}} battalion.

In Santa Fe several sick men and all <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{women and children were}} sent to Pueblo, in present-day Colorado.

25|$|Both drift {{gillnets}} and setnets {{have long been}} used by cultures around the world. There is evidence of fisheries exploitation, including gillnetting, going far back in Japanese history, with many specific details available from the Edo period (1603–1868). Fisheries in the Shetland Islands, which were settled by Norsemen during the Viking age, share cultural and technological similarities with Norwegian fisheries, including gillnet fisheries for herring. Many of the Norwegian immigrant fishermen who came to fish in the great Columbia River salmon fishery {{during the second half}} of the 19th century did so because they had experience in the gillnet fishery for cod in the waters surrounding the Lofoten Islands of northern Norway. Gillnets were used as part of the seasonal round by Swedish fishermen as well. Welsh and English fishermen gillnetted for Atlantic salmon in the rivers of Wales and England in coracles, using hand-made nets, for at least several centuries. These are <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> examples of historic gillnet fisheries around the world.|$|E

500|$|After this victory, the {{remainder}} of the Thirty fled to Eleusis, and the oligarchs within Athens began squabbling amongst themselves. [...] New leaders were selected, but were unable to deal with Thrasybulus, and were forced to send to Sparta for help. [...] From Sparta, however, came not the aggressive Lysander, but the more conservative Pausanias. [...] Pausanias' force narrowly defeated Thrasybulus' men, but only with great effort, and, unwilling to push the issue, he arranged a settlement between the forces of Thrasybulus and the oligarchs in the city. [...] Democracy was restored, while those oligarchs who wished to do so withdrew to Eleusis. [...] In power, Thrasybulus pushed through a law which pardoned all <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oligarchs, preventing a brutal reprisal by the victorious democrats.
