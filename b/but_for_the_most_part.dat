In Sierra Madre, four apartment buildings and nine homes were also tagged as uninhabitable. Of the more than 100 injuries that were reported in Arcadia, Pasadena, Glendale, and Sierra Madre, most were cuts, bruises, and sprains, but some serious injuries also occurred.|$|E

XML Schema allows one to mix DTD features with semantic information, such as keys and foreign keys.

We also show that it is possible to generate efficient code after the application of polyhedral program transformations.

Should a political settlement be agreed post-Cancún, the vulnerability of developing states is likely to be exacerbated. The only way to address both this potential danger and to remove some of the inertia plaguing the WTO is to place a moratorium on the negotiations of the Singapore issues and to concentrate instead on addressing the development dimension of the DDA. <b>The</b> problem <b>for</b> <b>the</b> industrial world is that to do so would be politically damaging. <b>But</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> vulnerable, maintaining <b>the</b> present course brings with it greater risks...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to suggest some theoretical basis for teaching Calculus at the beginner level in the EuropeanUniversity of Lefke (EUL). In EUL, Calculus courses are services courses, so classrooms are crowded and the numbers of instructors are few. The lecturers have faced different student profiles based on different mathematical and computer backgrounds with lack of motivation, lack of performance, poor interaction, and limited questions solving with low speed based on the level of students by using practice in class. Upon these problems, we are looking <b>for</b> not <b>for</b> <b>the</b> best <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> effective environment to motivate and to create a good environment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> teaching of Calculus. In this paper we discuss the advantages of CAS towards traditional teacher centered practice in class. On the basis of the literature review, we certainly know that these kinds of problems can provide a high-level of motivation because of its interactivity and instant feedback and attention...|$|R

40|$|Several {{researchers}} have suggested employing twostage entry monitors for high-speed networks - {{the first stage}} enforcing a long term rate, the second stage enforcing a peak rate over a shorter time scale. In spite of this interest, little work on analyzing such systems has appeared.

This paper presents a performance analysis of a two-stage entry monitor, by analyzing the combined queue length of a two-stage system. Our analysis is for a two-stage buffered moving window. Analyzing such a conservative scheme enables us to bound the penalty of more optimistic schemes, in particular a two stage leaky bucket based system. We obtain a closed form analytical result, and show how to evaluate it {{for a wide range}} of parameters of interest.
