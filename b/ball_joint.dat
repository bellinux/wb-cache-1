A new front control arm design with front hydraulic bushing and rear cross axis <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> for enhanced ride smoothness and better isolation from road noise and vibration. Internal rebound springs added to front struts for improved body motion control and to minimize crash-through. Increased wheel travel (3mm) and redesigned jounce bumpers for softer feel at full travel. Dual durometer cradle mounts for improved isolation. Premium valving and damping {{in the front and}} rear struts for a higher refinement in calibration. There were more accurate wheel sensors for improved ABS actuation. New steering calibration for more on-center feel and reduced parking effort.|$|E
25|$|Kawazoe, Maki and Kurokawa {{had invited}} a {{selection}} of world architects to design displays for the Mid-Air Exhibition {{that was to be}} incorporated within the roof. The architects included Moshe Safdie, Yona Friedman, Hans Hollein and Giancarlo De Carlo. Although Tange was obsessed with the theory of flexibility that the space framed provide he did concede that in reality it was not so practical for the actual fixing of the displays. The roof itself was designed by Koji Kamaya and Mamoru Kawaguchi who conceived it as a huge space frame. Kawaguchi invented a welding-free <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> to safely distribute the load and worked out a method of assembling the frame on the ground before raising it using jacks.|$|E
50|$|The SY II {{received}} a revised front suspension {{to address a}} well-documented weakness in the front lower <b>ball</b> <b>joints.</b> Specifically, the original design had the <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> under constant tension, which resulted in some complete failures of the joint (causing the wheel to detach from the suspension and steering) and premature wear requiring lower control arm replacements after as little as 30000 km. With the new design, the lower <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> were now under compression, thus eliminating the premature wear issue.|$|R

25|$|The {{powerful}} {{performance of}} Landis up to stage 16 of the Tour de France and his comeback in stage 17 is particularly notable given his hip ailment, osteonecrosis, which was revealed {{in an article}} in The New York Times during the 2006 Tour de France. This deterioration in the <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> of his right hip stemmed from diminished blood supply and constricted blood vessels caused by scar tissue. The original injury that {{led to the formation of}} the scar tissue was a femoral neck fracture sustained in a bicycle crash during a training ride near his Southern California home in October 2002. Landis kept the ailment secret from his teammates, rivals, and the media until an announcement was made while the 2006 Tour was underway. This same ailment also affected former multi-sport athlete Bo Jackson and American football player Brett Favre.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of its operation, the BMD-1 had no analogues abroad. Its main {{armament}} was a 73mm smoothbore gun with a coaxial 7.62mm PKT machine gun. It also had a launcher rail for the 9M14 Malyutka. Additional armaments include two bow-mounted 7.62mm PKT machine guns in the front part of the vehicle, in addition to one <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> firing port on either side and cover of the rear hatch to fire from individual weapons. The vehicle also featured a hydropneumatic suspension system capable of changing its ground clearance. A low weight of 7.5 t allowed it to be light enough to parachute from any types of military-transport aircraft. This airborne infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) also possessed one of the highest power-to-weight ratios at 32hp/tonne. The BMD-1 was the first domestically produced vehicle equipped with aluminum armor to ensure its light weight. The engineering incorporated in the BMD-1 allowed it {{to be used as a}} base vehicle for multiple variants including the BMD-1K and the BTR-D.|$|E
500|$|As more {{roads were}} built and average travel speeds increased, the {{inherent}} {{limitations of the}} pre-war suspension systems became obvious. Before the 1950s, most automobiles used a kingpin-based front suspension, which limited the degree of free movement and ultimately the smoothness of the ride, particularly at higher speeds. [...] The transition to a <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> type of suspension allowed greater flexibility in adjustment {{and the use of}} a variety of methods to support the weight of the car: leaf springs, coil springs and torsion bars. In combination with a shock absorber, the newer suspension designs made cars safer and more controllable at highway speeds, although at the cost of being slightly less durable than kingpin-based systems.|$|E

2500|$|To get balls that bounce unnaturally high or low, {{the plane}} of the machine must be set so that it is vertical. [...] Not all {{machines}} can do this, simply because their <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> doesn’t give the required range of movement. [...] To get balls that bounce higher than normal, the lower wheel should spin slightly faster than the upper. Deliveries that bounce much lower than normal are less common and are usually the result of the ball striking a broken-up patch of ground. [...] These balls can still be simulated, however, by increasing the speed of the upper wheel.|$|E
2500|$|The flying boom is {{attached}} {{to the rear of the}} tanker aircraft. [...] The attachment is gimballed, allowing the boom to move with the receiver aircraft. The boom contains a rigid pipe to transfer fuel. The fuel pipe ends in a nozzle with a flexible <b>ball</b> <b>joint.</b> [...] The nozzle mates to the [...] "receptacle" [...] in the receiver aircraft during fuel transfer. [...] A poppet valve in the end of the nozzle prevents fuel from exiting the tube until the nozzle properly mates with the receiver's refueling receptacle. [...] Once properly mated, toggles in the receptacle engage the nozzle, holding it locked during fuel transfer.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{mechanism}} of the machine consists of two heavy wheels, between 30 and 50cm in diameter, fitted with solid or pneumatic rubber tyres, each driven by its own electric motor. [...] These are mounted in a frame such that the wheels {{are in the same}} plane, about 7cm apart (slightly less than the diameter of a cricket ball). [...] A <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> allows the machine a wide range of movement. [...] The whole assembly is mounted on a sturdy tripod or other frame so that the plane of the wheels is roughly at the height that a typical bowler would release the ball. [...] A chute delivers the ball between the wheels, protecting the coach’s hands.|$|E
50|$|The {{arrangements}} for adjusting the toe angle are not changed by introducing <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> in the suspension, although {{it should be}} noted that the steering linkage itself must use 4 or more pivots, also usually <b>ball</b> <b>joints,</b> and in almost every vehicle ever made, some of these have been adjustable by having a threaded end and locknut, to enable the toe to be set precisely.|$|R
5000|$|On modern vehicles, <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> are {{the pivot}} between the wheels and the {{suspension}} of an automobile. They are today almost universally used in the front suspension, having replaced the kingpin/linkpin or kingpin/trunnion arrangement, but {{can also be found}} in the rear suspension of a few higher-performance autos. [...] <b>Ball</b> <b>joints</b> {{play a critical role in}} the safe operation of an automobile's steering and suspension.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} an approach for the modeling and numerical optimization of <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> within a Marker-less Motion Capture (MoCap) framework. In skeleton based approaches, kinematic chains {{are commonly used}} to model 1 DoF revolute joints. A 3 DoF joint (e. g. a shoulder or hip) is consequently modeled by concatenating three consecutive 1 DoF revolute joints. Obviously such a representation is not optimal and singularities can occur. Therefore, we propose to model 3 DoF joints with spherical <b>joints</b> or <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> using the representation of a twist and its exponential mapping (known from 1 DoF revolute joints). The exact modeling and numerical optimization of <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> requires additionally the adjoint transform and the logarithm of the exponential mapping. Experiments with simulated and real data demonstrate that <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> can better represent arbitrary rotations than the concatenation of 3 revolute joints. Moreover, we demonstrate that the 3 revolute joints representation {{is very similar to}} the Euler angles representation and has the same limitations in terms of singularities. 1...|$|R
2500|$|Drummers use a drum key for tuning their {{drums and}} {{adjusting}} some drum hardware. Besides the basic type of drum key (a T-handled wrench) {{there are various}} tuning wrenches and tools. Basic drum keys are divided in three types which allows tuning of three types of tuning screws on drums: square (most used), slotted and hexagonal. Ratchet-type wrenches allow high-tension drums to be tuned easily. Spin keys (utilizing a <b>ball</b> <b>joint)</b> allow rapid head changing. Torque-wrench type keys are available, graphically revealing the torque at each lug. Also, tension gauges, or meters, which are set on the head, aid drummers to achieve a consistent tuning. Drummers can tune drums [...] "by ear" [...] or, in the 2010s, use a digital drum tuner, which [...] "measures tympanic pressure" [...] on the drumhead to provide accurate tuning.|$|E
2500|$|The Sud-Ouest Djinn was {{the first}} tip-jet {{propelled}} rotorcraft to enter production. As such, the propulsion system involved a Turbomeca Palouste gas turbine engine that drove a pump to produce compressed air, which was in turn fed into the aircraft's hollow rotor blades to exit at their tips, inducing the blades to turn as a consequence. The rotor hub assembly, which freely oscillated around a spherical thrust bearing, was mounted upon a steel pylon via means of a <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> and rubber shock absorbers. Unlike some of the experimental tip-jet designs of the era, a 'cold' tip-jet approach was used, meaning {{that there was no}} combustion activity present at the exhaust nozzles installed at the ends of the rotor blades. Consequently, the nozzles produced little noise in their operation, and were claimed by Sud-Ouest to be [...] "noiseless".|$|E
2500|$|In {{his time}} at McLaren, Hulme won six Grands Prix, but he was {{nearing the end of}} his time in F1, and his {{competitive}} urges were being blunted by a growing apprehension about the dangers of racing. After the Brazilian Grand Prix in which Hulme finished in twelfth place, these fears were well founded. when testing at Kyalami commenced, in March 1974, Peter Revson suffered a front suspension failure (broken front <b>Ball</b> <b>Joint),</b> veering head-on into the barriers. Hulme tried in vain to save his friend's life, but to no avail. After the accident Hulme announced that he would see out [...] before retiring from Grand Prix racing. However, other than winning the Argentine event (he inherited the lead when his now teammate Fittipaldi inadvertently knocked-off the electrical [...] "kill-switch" [...] on his steering wheel, on the penultimate lap) and coming home second in Austria, he did not make much of an impact on the season, and he retired dignified {{at the end of the}} year and stepped away from the sport and returned to New Zealand.|$|E

2500|$|The Mason Bogie was still, though, {{plagued by}} one of the biggest {{problems}} of the Fairlie - the jointed steam pipes to the driven truck leaked far too much steam. Mason eventually changed to a different scheme, in which the pivot point for the leading truck became a hollow <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> through which the live steam for the cylinders passed. [...] Mason also developed a sliding seal for the exhaust from the moving cylinder saddle into the smoke box. Although better, Mason's improvements took up much valuable space in between the driving wheels, forcing Mason to use an outside valve gear, generally the Walschaerts valve gear. Additionally, the reversing shaft had to be mounted atop the boiler, with a long lifting link dropping down to the radius rod, a feature unique to Mason Bogies (this was necessary because the lifting link would swing to the side as the truck pivoted, lifting the radius rod and changing the valve setting. [...] Lengthening the link, and thus increasing the radius of its swing, minimized the amount of change.).|$|E
2500|$|The non-fatal {{incident}} occurred on 8 May 1951. It involved a Hunting Air Travel Vickers 639 Viking 1 (registration: G-AHPD) operating an international scheduled passenger flight from Bordeaux Mérignac to RAF Bovingdon. Following an uneventful takeoff from Mérignac, the no. 1 engine suddenly {{began to lose}} power when the aircraft climbed through [...] and the pilot in command throttled down to initial climbing speed. The pilot then shut down the malfunctioning engine, feathered the propeller and applied full power to the no. 2 engine {{to compensate for the}} loss of engine no. 1. However, this was insufficient to maintain altitude and led to the flightdeck crew's decision to execute a gear-up landing. When the aircraft touched the ground, it slid for about [...] before coming to a halt. There were no fatalities among the 32 occupants (five crew and 27 passengers). Accident investigators established the probable cause as the disconnecting of the articulated control rod of the propeller governor {{due to the lack of}} a split pin on the governor spindle, and due to the nut of the <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> of the control spindle having been unscrewed by force.|$|E

5000|$|In non-MacPherson strut {{automobile}} suspension, the two {{ball joints}} {{are called the}} [...] "upper ball joint" [...] and [...] "lower ball joint". Lower ball joints are sometimes larger and may wear out faster, because the fore and aft loads, primarily due to braking, are higher at the bottom <b>ball</b> <b>joint.</b> (Torque reaction and drag add at the bottom joint, and partly cancel at the top joint.) Also, lateral cornering loads are higher at the bottom joint. Depending on the suspension design, the vertical load from the suspension spring may be handled entirely by the top <b>ball</b> <b>joint,</b> or entirely by the bottom <b>ball</b> <b>joint.</b> The damper load, (which is low in normal conditions, zero when stationary, but in peak bump or rebound rate may be almost {{as large as the}} spring load) is usually, but not always, taken on the same <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> as the spring load.
