25|$|The AC Ace LM Prototype was {{a single}} piece from the year 1958 with the unusual chassis number LM5000, which John Tojeiro {{designed}} {{on behalf of the}} brothers Hurlock specifically for the AC factory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and for further long distance racing]. The vehicle was only 737-kilogram and differed fundamentally from the standard model: it had a load-bearing, lightweight, tubular steel frame without the massive ladder structure, a new front axle with single wheel suspension, this time in the form of upper and lower triangular steering with coil spring / shock units, and a newly designed pendulum axle at the rear. The open aluminium body was much flatter, with larger overhangs at the front and rear and aerodynamically rounded with a lowered down front and high tail. It was designed by the <b>body</b> <b>builder</b> Cavendish Morton. The engine/ transmission unit, a tuned production unit, came from the Bristol Type 100D2 / S. After a test ride on the Brooklands circuit, just a few kilometres from the AC factory, the prototype, which was not yet mature, completed two assignments in 1958: in June as a factory car in the Le Mans 24-hour race and in September in the Rudac Racing Team at the RAC Tourist Trophy at the Goodwood Circuit. Due to changes in the regulations, the car was no longer able to compete in the next-class category in the FIA - Sportscar World Championship. The 'Bristol' engine / gearbox unit went back there, the racing car was sold without drive and later rebuilt. It still exists today as a collector's item.|$|E

500|$|Vikram {{signed on}} to {{collaborate}} again with Shankar for I, a romantic thriller opposite Amy Jackson, in early 2012. Following hushed production developments, {{it was revealed that}} the actor would sport four significantly different looks in the film: a <b>body</b> <b>builder,</b> a beast, a model and a hunchback. He put on weight to portray the bodybuilder, sticking to a diet of protein and coffee, to ensure his muscles are defined on screen. Vikram subsequently lost weight to portray a model, before shaving his head and reducing his weight to 56 kilograms to portray the crippled hunchback. He changed his physique by eating small meals of egg whites and apples instead of regular food intakes, while engaging in an intensive weight loss regime to become thin. The cast and crew of the film reportedly struggled to recognise the actor at times, while he also stayed away from the media for close to a year when sporting the look. Taking almost three years for production, Vikram described the film [...] "as the toughest he has ever done" [...] and regularly suffered folliculitis {{as a result of the}} prosthetic make-up he had to wear. The film opened amidst much expectation in January 2015 to mixed reviews, though critics gave Vikram's portrayal of Lingesan, unanimously positive reviews. A critic from Times of India noted [...] "Vikram bowls you over with a heart-wrenching performance whether he is handsome or disfigured", while The Hindu added his transformation was [...] "laudable", and that [...] "Vikram wins hearts as the earnest-to-boot gym rat and as the strapping new model on the block, he floors the audience with his performance as Koonan, the deformed hunchback". Similarly Rediff.com noted the actor [...] "is truly impressive and deserves much applause", while Sify.com added he [...] "lived the role". Despite mixed reviews, I performed well at the box office, as well as becoming the most successful Tamil film of all time in Kerala. He then worked on Vijay Milton's road-thriller, 10 Enradhukulla (2015), which featured him as an unnamed race driver who goes on a road trip through India. Paired opposite Samantha, the film opened to mixed reviews and did not perform well at the box office. A critic from Sify.com however noted Vikram [...] "breathes life to his role and his energy level is highly infectious", adding that [...] "the way he smiles, dances and fight is a treat for his fans". Likewise a critic from The Hindu criticised the film's script adding [...] "it's hard to see Vikram in this fluff". Vikram later appeared in Iru Mugan, a science fiction action film directed by Anand Shankar, featuring him alongside Nayantara and Nithya Menen.|$|E

Thirty-six adults, 26 male (27. 2 ± 7. 2 years) and 10 female (30 ± 6. 1 years) nationwide competitive <b>body</b> <b>builders,</b> were assessed considering weight, height, body mass index, adiposity, arm and leg circumferences and skinfolds. The data were referred either as percentile or standard deviations (Z score) of population standards. Body weight and height were among the closest values from the populational mean whereas upper arm muscle circumference (for men) and body adiposity (for women) were the farterest. By using fat parameters as indicators of their protein-energy status, the undernourishment was found in 88. 5 % of men and 100. 0 % of women.

He began training for a professional wrestling career in the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) Gym under Karloff Lagarde and Ray Mendoza as well as training with Ojo de Tigre and Ebano Ruiz. He made his professional wrestling debut in 1992 under the ring name Urko and later worked as Espiritu Negro for a brief period of time. After wrestling for a few months he decided to dedicate himself to developing his physique and receive further training in the UWA wrestling school. In June, 1994 he made his re-debut for the UWA, this time working under a new ring character, Cibernético, (meaning [...] "cybernetic" [...] or Cyborg), complete with a colorful mask that looked like it had printed circuitry on it to enhance the [...] "Cyborg" [...] character. On July 31, 1994 Cibernétcio wrestled on his first Toreo de Cuatro Caminos show, UWA's biggest venue. On the night he teamed up with veterans El Canek and Dos Caras, taking on Los Villanos, Villano III, Villano IV and Villano V. While he made his debut as a tecnico (fan favorite) he soon turned against El Canek, turning rudo (villain), setting up a feud with the UWA's top tecnico in the hopes of using Cibernético to replace some of the UWA headliners that had left the promotion. The attempt to create new headliners was too late and by January 1995 the UWA closed down.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the current diet related practices of amateur <b>body</b> <b>builders</b> within the Illawarra region as well as to identify the principal sources of nutrition information used by these athletes. A self-administered questionnaire was used to obtain information from athletes training at five Illawarra gymnasiums. Thirty two competitive and noncompetitive <b>body</b> <b>builders</b> participated in the study. The questionnaire consisted of fourteen questions both open and closed-ended and was used to investigate the following issues: the major sources, used by <b>body</b> <b>builders,</b> for obtaining nutrition information; the ease of access to the information; current diet related practices of amateur body builders; diet related practices resulting from the information gained; and whether there was a need for an educational resource targeting the dietary needs of amateur <b>body</b> <b>builders.</b> The sources of nutrition information most often used by the respondents included articles from both body building magazines and other magazines, friends and fellow <b>body</b> <b>builders</b> and gym staff.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Two main {{questions}} are stated: 1) are BIA and anthropometric equations accurate in estimating body composition in male power athletes {{and more specifically}} in <b>body</b> <b>builders</b> and 2) {{is there a difference}} in body composition when <b>body</b> <b>builders</b> are compared to weight and power lifters? METHODS: Experimental design: this is a descriptive, comparative study on a selected sample of power athletes. Participants: 49 Belgian elite and sub-top male power athletes (34 <b>body</b> <b>builders</b> and 15 weight and power lifters) were included in this sample. More than 70 % was in preparation of competition at time of data collection. Measures: an extended set of anthropometric measures was taken. Body composition was estimated by BIA (Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis) and by regression equations of skinfolds. Somatotype and muscle+bone areas were calculated. Factor analysis on all anthropometric measures was carried out to determine the body structure of the athletes. RESULTS: Compared to external visual criteria, the equations of Durnin and Womersley and Lohman (skinfolds) and the Guo-equation (BIA) were the only equations that could accurately estimate the body composition for this specific group of athletes. However, the sum of skinfolds attains the most accurate estimate of subcutaneous fatness. <b>Body</b> <b>builders</b> have significantly (p< 0. 01) larger arm and thigh circumferences and are more mesomorfic than the other power athletes (5. 9 vs 3. 8). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that to estimate body composition in extreme power athletes BIA is not as accurate as compared to anthropometric equations. Moreover, the sum of a larger set of skinfolds is preferred to anthropometric prediction equations. In addition, <b>body</b> <b>builders</b> are more muscular and leaner than other power athletes. status: publishe...|$|R

Group 3 showed an increase of the transaminases an a slight but significant increase of systolic blood pressure (+ 3 mm Hg) and heart rate (+ 7 bts/min) after one course of AS (P less than 0. 05). Group 1 showed a considerably lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) (P less than 0. 001), a higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) (P less than 0. 05), and a lower apoprotein A-l/B ratio (Apo A-l/ApoB) (P less than 0. 001) than the controls and group 2.
