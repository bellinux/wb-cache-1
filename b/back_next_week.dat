500|$|Tom Chambers was {{approached}} about assuming {{the role of}} Sam by BBC casting director Julie Harkin, who was also responsible for casting fellow Holby City newcomers Rakie Ayola as Kyla Tyson and Luke Roberts as Joseph Byrne. Chambers has revealed that he sent a video of himself performing a Fred Astaire tap dance routine to over 800 stage and television directors and producers in the [...] UK, explaining: [...] "Julie Harkin in casting at Holby saw it {{and gave me a}} call because they thought it was unusual. Originally I went up for a small role as an American doctor, but after the audition they said come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> to audition for a bigger part and that was it!" [...] Upon assuming the role of Sam, Chambers revealed that he had once been an avid viewer of Holby City's sister show, Casualty, recalling watching it as far back as 1991.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "This just {{might have been}} the best Once Upon a Time so far this season, despite “Labor of Love” largely {{focusing}} on two people we’ve only just met. This episode had the perfect balance of well-paced drama, strong character arcs, and a solid twist or two to compel us to come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b> This essentially recaptured that adventurous, yet emotionally grounded feeling of the first two seasons. To say I loved this {{would be one of the}} big understatements of the TV season so far." ...|$|E

6000|$|Her urgency made me laugh, {{even while}} I {{perceived}} the pathos of it.

Be patient a little while longer. I promise you the whole question will be settled soon, and I {{hope it will be}} settled our way. Zulime seems to like me." ...|$|E
5000|$|Under Russert, {{the program}} was {{expanded}} to one hour and became less of a televised press conference, focusing more on Russert's questions and comments; Russert also engaged in longer in-depth interviews and hosted panels of experts to discuss the topics featured in that week's broadcast. Russert signed off each edition by saying, [...] "That's all for today. We'll be <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b> If it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press." ...|$|E

50|$|Liberty again became conference co-champions in 2010. They {{were looking}} to beat Stony Brook in the season finale to win the 2010 Big South Championship but they first had to beat rival Coastal Carolina.

5000|$|When Gallardo {{returned}}, {{there was}} no news on the case, so she came <b>back</b> the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> with still no further news. Gallardo returned each week for 25 weeks until finally Aurora was released on October 18. [...] By that time, the case was famous; locals had followed updates to {{the story in the}} local newspaper. [...] A publisher donated 1000 cards funeral invitations and a funeral home donated a casket, hearse, and cross.|$|R
5000|$|In the 14 years we've {{been doing}} South Park {{we have never}} done a show that we couldn't stand behind. We {{delivered}} our version of the show to Comedy Central and they made a determination to alter the episode. It wasn't some meta-joke on our part. Comedy Central added the bleeps. In fact, Kyle's customary final speech was about intimidation and fear. It didn't mention Muhammad at all but it got bleeped too. We'll be <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> with a whole new show about something completely different and we'll see what happens to it.|$|E
5000|$|In {{my opinion}} this {{argument}} is about as logical as saying that if one had been told, on entering a casino, that the odds on No 7 coming up at roulette were only 1 in 37, one would have gone away and come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> or gone to a different casino. The question is whether one would have taken the opportunity to avoid or reduce the risk, not whether one would have changed the scenario in some irrelevant detail. The judge found as {{a fact that the}} risk would have been precisely the same whether it was done then or later or by that competent surgeon or by another." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{cleaning}} {{her former}} high school {{for a while and}} hearing more news stories about the mirror Earth, Rhoda visits John's house after he has recovered, thinking she will apologize for the harm she did to him. He answers the door and she loses her nerve. Instead, she pretends to be a maid offering a free day of cleaning as a marketing tool for Maid in Haven (a New Haven-based maid service). John, who has dropped out of his Yale music faculty position and is now living in a depressed and dirty stupor, agrees to Rhoda's offer. When she finishes, John, who still does not know she is the person who killed his wife and son, asks her to come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b> Rhoda tells him someone will come, {{but it may not be}} her.|$|E

I lent it to Captain Neal, of Brimley, having no present use for it, and he won't bring it <b>back</b> till <b>next</b> <b>week</b> some time. There's a dory here, to be sure; but Sanpritchit's twenty-five miles away, and that's too far {{to go in a}} dory, {{especially}} at night. What's your hurry?" ...|$|R
50|$|The Atlanta Falcons {{hoped to}} bounce <b>back</b> the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> against the Pittsburgh Steelers, {{and they did}} so with a huge game. In a shootout rivaling the {{following}} week's Indianapolis-Denver game, the Falcons beat the Steelers 41-38 in overtime as Morten Andersen kicked a game-winning 32-yard field goal. Falcons QB Michael Vick had a career-high 4 touchdown passes, including 3 to star TE Alge Crumpler. Both teams combined for 9 touchdown passes and 872 yards of total offense. With the win, the Falcons improved to 4-2.|$|R
50|$|Beauregard is {{contemptuous of}} {{television}} and what he deems its anti-intellectual nature, particularly after seeing Masquerade for Money and its flamboyant host, Happy Hogan (Art Linkletter). However, it gives him a brilliant idea for revenge on Burnbridge Waters. He goes on the program dressed as an encyclopedia, prepared to answer any question. Starting from an initial $5 prize, Beauregard easily answers the maximum five questions. The show runs out of time, but Beauregard promises to come <b>back</b> the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> if people will write in to Milady Soap demanding he be allowed to return.|$|R
5000|$|He {{also told}} {{stories of his}} other flops (adding at one point [...] "I wish I didn't {{know so much about}} these things"), and had the John Smith/Pocahontas {{illustration}} brought out to show what the format was for those [...] "fortunate enough not to see last week's show". He also fulfilled contractual obligations by incorporating live commercials into the broadcast. He also noted that nobody commented on how the show itself was after it finished airing, instead mentioning how good the commercials were and that the show went off the air at the right time. He ended his commentary with, [...] "I'm coming <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week!</b> I don't know what we're gonna do ... so, {{take my word for it}} ... tune in on the next chapter, because this might be the greatest 'soapless' opera you've ever seen!".|$|E
5000|$|Matt Kenseth led {{the field}} to the green flag at 2:16 p.m. Erik Jones made contact with Kasey Kahne exiting Turn 2 on the first lap, leading to a left-front tire cut and {{slamming}} the wall on the seventh lap in Turn 3, bringing out the first caution of the race. Jones, after being released from the infield care center, said he and Kahne, were [...] "three-wide right on the start and then the 5 ran us up into the fence. I {{was trying not to}} wreck everybody and then a couple laps later the GameStop Prey Toyota Camry cut a left-front tire. It’s just really a heartbreaking day. It’s not what we wanted, but we’ll just have to come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> with another fast race car and try to run up front again.” He went on to finish last.|$|E

5000|$|The song is an {{aggressive}} hard rock number that {{opens with a}} slower synthesizer based interlude before opening up into a full hard rock tune. The lyrics involve a scorned lover who apparently can't {{get away from the}} grasp of her heartless partner. [...] "The doctor said come <b>back</b> again <b>next</b> <b>week</b> / I think that you need me / All she did was cry / She wanted to die doctor when can you see me / There's a guy out there / Seems like he's everywhere / It just ain't fair." ...|$|R

50|$|Leinart's first career pass was a {{touchdown}} against Auburn in a 23-0 {{victory in the}} season opener. He would win the first three games of his career before the then-#3 Trojans suffered a 34 - 31 triple-overtime defeat at California on September 27 that dropped the Trojans to #10. Leinart and the Trojans bounced <b>back</b> the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> against Arizona State. Leinart injured his knee {{in the second quarter}} and was not expected to play again that day, but he returned to the game and finished 12-of-23 for 289 yards in a 37 - 17 victory.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{programme}} {{was renamed}} Saturday Showdown, the show {{no longer had}} the Doc or his lab. Though on 18 March 2006, the Doc made a surprise appearance {{at the end of the}} main show. The part went as follows: Just as Holly and Stephen are about to say goodbye, Stephen found a German towel. They both say [...] "he isn't back is he?" [...] and we see through the door's frosted glass, the blur of The Doctor and he shouts through the letterbox. But viewers without cable or satellite never got to see him that week, as he only fully appeared on the CITV Channel's Holly and Stephen's Saturday Showdown Extra. Though Stephen asked the Doc on the show if he could come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> it was to be a one off appearance, and The Foundation confirmed that the Doc was only a guest for this show. However, the Doc re-appeared for the final show on 1 July 2006.|$|E
50|$|In the carpool {{on the way}} to school, he doesn't get {{a window}} seat. At school, his teacher, Mrs. Dickens, discourages his picture of the {{invisible}} castle (which is actually just a blank sheet of paper), criticizes him for singing too loud, and publicly scolds him for skipping the number 16 at counting time. His best friend Paul, deserts him for Phillip Parker and Albert Moyo, and says Alexander therefore is his third best friend. At lunch, Phillip has two cupcakes for dessert, Albert has a Hershey's bar, and Paul has a jelly roll with coconut sprinkles. But since Alexander's mother had forgot to put in dessert, there is no dessert in his lunch bag. The dentist tells him he has a cavity (and thus Alexander {{is the only one who}} had one) and he has to come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> so it can be fixed; the elevator door closes on his foot; Anthony pushes him into a mud puddle; Nick says he is a crybaby; he punches Nick in response, and their mother punishes him for being muddy and fighting Nick.|$|E
5000|$|Bessie Banks later commented:"'I {{remember}} 1963 Kennedy was assassinated; it {{was announced}} over the radio. At the time, I was rehearsing {{in the office of}} Leiber and Stoller. We called it a day. Everyone was in tears. [...] "Come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> and we will be ready to record 'Go Now'"; and we did so. I was happy and excited that maybe this time I’ll make it. 'Go Now' was released and right away it was chosen Pick Hit of the Week on W.I.N.S. Radio. That means your record is played for seven days. Four days went by, I was so thrilled. On day five, when I heard the first line, I thought it was me, but all of a sudden, I realized it wasn’t. At the end of the song {{it was announced}}, [...] "the Moody Blues singing 'Go Now'". I was too out-done. This was the time of the English Invasion and the end of Bessie Banks’ career, so I thought. America's DJs had stopped promoting American artists." ...|$|E
50|$|Doege threw three {{touchdown}} passes as Texas Tech opened Big XII {{play with a}} 24-13 win over Iowa State, but he was intercepted three times as Tech fell to Oklahoma by the score of 41-20.

50|$|The game {{consisted}} of three rounds. In the first round, each contestant was asked four questions about the UK, four about Australia, and four about the USA (for example, what {{was the name of}} this bridge; each correct answer was worth one point. In the second round, each contestant had two minutes to answer questions on a chosen subject, with each correct answer worth two points; returning champions were asked general knowledge questions. The final round was a four-minute buzz-in round; each correct answer was worth three points, but an incorrect answer resulted in losing three points. The player with the highest score won and came <b>back</b> the <b>next</b> <b>week.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "Art Rebrovich, Vandy's 165-pound back, {{was accused}} of {{slugging}} and with his ejection from the game went an 11-yard penalty. Three plays later Charley Ishmael, Cat fullback {{who was supposed to}} have had a sprained ankle, shot through right guard and into the end zone for the touchdown. Hardly a hand touched him." [...] Sanders was able to come <b>back</b> the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> to travel to Georgia Tech. Vanderbilt finished with a 3-6-1 record including a 25-21 loss to 17th ranked Alabama.

5000|$|Reviewing {{the first}} episode for The Guardian {{newspaper}} the day after it had aired, Gareth McLean wrote that [...] "...it's bloody magic. The story is gripping, the acting is ace and Paul Abbott's script is outstanding. His ear for dialogue, and for different voices, is exceptional. The exposition is swift, nifty and joyously unclunky. The characters are credible and rounded. If you can count the best dramas of recent years on the fingers of both hands, it's time to grow a new finger." [...] Other newspaper critics were similarly impressed with the opening installment. In The Times, Paul Hoggart wrote that [...] "Two excellent performances Morrissey and Simm ensure that the relationship has a turbulent dynamism that is credible and engaging." [...] James Walton in The Daily Telegraph was more cautious, feeling that the opening episode had been promising but the serial as a whole still {{had the potential to}} go wrong. [...] "At this stage however, the programme is certainly good enough to make me hope not and to ensure that I'll be <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> to find out." ...|$|E
5000|$|Philip Jenkinson {{said in an}} {{interview}} in 2003: [...] "One day when I was giving a lecture at St Martin’s School of Art, a BBC producer, Mike Appleton, was waiting at the back to pick up his girlfriend and he caught the last 10 minutes. He came over and said it was very interesting. ‘I am a producer of a programme called Late Night Line-Up. Would you like to come along and do something similar on the programme?’ They liked it and asked me to come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> and do another one. I initially signed a contract for six months, which grew and grew. I ended up staying with Late Night Line Up for five years. The talk and emphasis was always about old movies. Film Night came out of Late Night Line Up. It started with me and Tony Bilbow. Tony reviewed the new films whilst I related the new films to ones that were made earlier, linking them with either a director or a star or the style; something they had in common." [...] He was later asked by Late Night Live producer Rowan Ayers to help him launch The Beatles Abbey Road album.|$|E
5000|$|The race {{restarted}} with 42 laps to go. The seventh caution of {{the race}} flew with 41 laps {{to go for a}} multi-car wreck on the backstretch. Exiting turn 2, Johnson made contact with the rear-end of Austin Dillon and sent him sliding into the wall. Dillon overcorrected and hit the outside wall with the right-front of his car. His car turned down the track, was clipped by Ricky Stenhouse Jr., slid down and tapped the inside wall. With a number of cars trying to avoid the spinning No. 3 car, an accordion-effect led to more cars being caught up in the melee. A total of 13 cars sustained damage in the wreck. Dillon said afterwards that being on older tires, he [...] "was trying to get all I could there. It’s part of trying to win a race. We put ourselves in a position to be out front, thinking that two laps wouldn’t mean much, but it did. That’s part of it. The good Lord kept me safe tonight and gave me a good race car. You have to be gracious in defeat. We’ll come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> with another fast car and hopefully we can do the same thing we did today, and that’s run up front." ...|$|E
50|$|After the loss, Davie named Holiday the {{starting}} quarterback for the Texas A&M game. Though LoVecchio would play in later games, he would never start again for the Irish and eventually transferred from the school. Playing in front of, at the time, the largest crowd ever to watch a football game in Texas, Holiday was knocked {{out of the game}} with a neck injury before halftime. The Irish were unable move the ball and lost 24-3, moving to 0-3 for the first time ever. With Holiday <b>back</b> the <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> he led the Irish to their first victory of the season against the Pittsburgh Panthers, and continued to roll with wins over West Virginia and USC to put the Irish back to a 3-3 record. With a loss the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> to Boston College, however, the Irish hopes for a bowl game were dwindling and all but gone with a loss the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> to the seventh-ranked Tennessee Volunteers.|$|R
50|$|The Fighting Irish came <b>back</b> the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> against Michigan State. In {{the first}} quarter, Kevin Nosbusch {{recovered}} a fumble caused by Mike Stock and Mike Fanning.
