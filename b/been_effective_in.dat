5|$|Although {{cardiovascular}} risk factors, such as hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, {{are associated}} with a higher risk of onset and course of AD, statins, which are cholesterol lowering drugs, have not <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> preventing or improving the course of the disease.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} {{method of}} locating {{the site of}} a CSF leak is to use heavily T2-weighted MR myelography. This has <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> identifying the sites of a CSF leak without the need for a CT scan, lumbar puncture, and contrast and at locating fluid collections such as CSF pooling. Another highly successful method of locating a CSF leak is intrathecal contrast and MR Myelography.|$|E
5|$|The {{long neck}} of Dinocephalosaurus {{probably}} served a functional role. In particular, {{the length of}} the neck places a long distance between the head and the remainder of the body. This would have allowed Dinocephalosaurus to approach potential prey without the majority of its bulk being detected, which would have <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> the murky waters of its habitat.|$|E
25|$|Moxifloxacin, cefepime, tigecycline, and {{ertapenem}} do {{not appear}} to <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> vitro. Piperacillin-sulbactam, doripenem and biapenem appear to <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> vitro, but no clinical experience exists on which to recommend their use.|$|R
50|$|Contingency {{contracts}} {{have been}} seen to <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> changing any undesired behaviours of individuals.

50|$|FOLFIRI is {{used for}} {{colorectal}} cancer and gastric cancer. FOLFIRI <b>is</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, {{but it has not}} been shown to <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> the adjuvant therapy of colon and rectal cancer.|$|R
5|$|Elephant endotheliotropic {{herpesvirus}}es (EEHV) or Elephantid herpesvirus 1' {{is a type}} of herpesvirus, {{which can}} cause a highly fatal hemorrhagic disease when transmitted to young Asian elephants. In African elephants, related forms of these viruses, which have been identified in wild populations, are generally benign, occasionally surfacing to cause small growths or lesions. However, some types of EEHV can cause a highly fatal disease in Asian elephants, which kills up to 80% of severely affected individuals. The disease can be treated with the rapid application of antiviral drugs, but this has only <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> around a third of cases.|$|E
5|$|No {{medications}} directly {{treat the}} core symptoms of AS. Although {{research into the}} efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention for AS is limited, {{it is essential to}} diagnose and treat comorbid conditions. Deficits in self-identifying emotions or in observing effects of one's behavior on others can make it difficult for individuals with AS to see why medication may be appropriate. Medication can be effective in combination with behavioral interventions and environmental accommodations in treating comorbid symptoms such as anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, inattention and aggression. The atypical antipsychotic medications risperidone and olanzapine have been shown to reduce the associated symptoms of AS; risperidone can reduce repetitive and self-injurious behaviors, aggressive outbursts and impulsivity, and improve stereotypical patterns of behavior and social relatedness. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline have <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> treating restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors.|$|E
5|$|The {{antibodies}} {{induced by}} vaccinia vaccine are cross-protective for other orthopoxviruses, such as monkeypox, cowpox, and variola (smallpox) viruses. Neutralizing antibodies are detectable 10 days after first-time vaccination, and seven days after revaccination. Historically, the vaccine has <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> preventing smallpox infection in 95 {{percent of those}} vaccinated. Smallpox vaccination provides {{a high level of}} immunity for three to five years and decreasing immunity thereafter. If a person is vaccinated again later, immunity lasts even longer. Studies of smallpox cases in Europe in the 1950s and 1960s demonstrated that the fatality rate among persons vaccinated less than 10 years before exposure was 1.3 percent; it was 7 percent among those vaccinated 11 to 20 years prior, and 11 percent among those vaccinated 20 or more years prior to infection. By contrast, 52 percent of unvaccinated persons died.|$|E

5|$|The {{question}} of whether the defences would have <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> invasion is vexed. In mid-1940, the preparations relied heavily upon field fortifications. The First World War made it clear that assaulting prepared defences with infantry was deadly and difficult, but similar preparations in Belgium had been overrun by well-equipped German Panzer divisions in the early weeks of 1940 and with so many armaments left at Dunkirk, British forces were woefully ill-equipped to take on German armour. On the other hand, while British preparations for defence were ad hoc, so were the German invasion plans: a fleet of 2,000 converted barges and other vessels had been hurriedly made available and their fitness was debatable; in any case, the Germans could not land troops with all their heavy equipment. Until the Germans captured a port, both armies would have been short of tanks and heavy guns.|$|E
5|$|The final {{attack on}} 28 February also {{began with a}} mortar attack, but the {{communist}} assault wave was broken up by mortar fire, {{and was forced to}} withdraw to the east. Three Americans were wounded. A clearing patrol later revealed that the Viet Cong had inserted a mortar team {{to the edge of the}} rubber trees by night in a Lambretta and a cart and had then manhandled the tubes into position. 3 RAR's defence of FSB Andersen was the first occasion in the history of their operations in Vietnam that an Australian fire support base had been subjected to a ground assault while during all three attacks the cavalry and artillery in support had played a key role in the defence. Throughout the later part of the operation the patrolling rifle companies had systematically searched the AO and although contact was infrequent the patrols had <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> denying the subsequent use of the area to launch rocket attacks against the bases in Long Binh and Bien Hoa.|$|E
25|$|Technologies {{have been}} {{designed}} for resource poor settings that have <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> reducing maternal deaths as well. The non-pneumatic anti-shock garment is a low-technology pressure device that decreases blood loss, restores vital signs and helps buy time in delay of women receiving adequate emergency care during obstetric hemorrhage. It {{has proven to be}} a valuable resource. Condoms used as uterine tamponades have also <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> stopping post-partum hemorrhage.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of hyperprolactinemia-associated macromastia with D2 {{receptor}} agonists such as bromocriptine and cabergoline {{has been}} found to <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> some, but not all cases.

50|$|Gabapentin may {{be useful}} in the {{treatment}} of comorbid anxiety in bipolar patients, (however not the bipolar state itself).Gabapentin may <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> acquired pendular nystagmus and infantile nystagmus, (but not periodic alternating nystagmus). It <b>is</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> hot flashes. It may <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> reducing pain and spasticity in multiple sclerosis. Gabapentin may reduce symptoms of alcohol withdrawal (but it does not prevent the associated seizures). Use for smoking cessation has had mixed results. Gabapentin <b>is</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> alleviating itching in kidney failure (uremic pruritus) and itching of other causes. It is an established treatment of restless leg syndrome. Gabapentin may help sleeping problems in people with restless leg syndrome and partial seizures. Gabapentin may be an option in essential or orthostatic tremor.|$|R
25|$|Zaleplon <b>is</b> {{slightly}} <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> the management/treatment of insomnia, primarily {{characterized by}} difficulty falling asleep. Due to its ultrashort elimination half-life, zaleplon may not <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> reducing premature awakenings.|$|R
25|$|Moral suasion has {{sometimes}} <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> resolving religious disharmony, {{especially if the}} Government is actively involved as a mediator. Moral suasion has <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> Singapore {{in the creation of}} religious harmony among different religious groups. When conflicts do arise, the Government of Singapore's approach is to mediate or resolve the issue through common sense, and moral suasion using the collective efforts of the community, grassroots and religious leaders.|$|E
25|$|Pressure {{dressings}} {{are commonly}} used in managing burn and hypertrophic scars, although supporting evidence is lacking. Care providers commonly report improvements, however, and pressure therapy has <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> treating ear keloids. The general acceptance of the treatment as effective may prevent it from being further studied in clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|Arguably, {{the sack}} of Wexford was {{somewhat}} counter-productive for the Parliamentarians. The {{destruction of the}} town meant that the Parliamentarians could not use its port {{as a base for}} supplying their forces in Ireland. Secondly, the effects of the severe measures adopted at Drogheda and at Wexford were mixed. To some degree they may have <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> discouraging future resistance.|$|E

25|$|The Taipei Metro is Taiwan's first metro system. Since {{it first}} began {{operations}} in 1996, {{the system has}} <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> relieving some of Taipei's traffic congestion problems. The system has also proved effective {{as a catalyst for}} urban renewal, as well as increasing tourist traffic to outlying towns such as Tamsui. Conversions to existing railway lines were made to integrate them into the metro system.|$|E
25|$|Asymmetric {{catalysis}} involving {{nearly complete}} protonation of substrate has <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> Mannich reactions of aromatic aldimines with carbon nucleophiles. In addition, aza-Friedel-Crafts reactions of furans, amidoalkylations of diazocarbonyl compounds, asymmetric hydrophosphonylation of aldimines and transfer hydrogenations {{have also been}} reported. Chiral Brønsted acids are often easily prepared from chiral alcohols such as BINOLs, and many are already present in the literature due to their established utility in molecular recognition research.|$|E
25|$|The barrier has <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> {{preventing}} {{terrorists and}} suicide bombers from entering Israel from Gaza. Since 1996, virtually all suicide bombers {{trying to leave}} Gaza have detonated their charges at the barrier's crossing points and were stopped while trying to cross the barrier elsewhere. From 1994 until 2004 a suicide bomber originating from within the Gaza Strip successfully carried out an attack in Israel (the March 14, 2004 attack in Ashdod).|$|E

25|$|Various {{attempts}} for refloating {{the ship}} were suggested. University of Sydney Honorary Associate Professor Rob Wheen suggested liquefying the sand under the ship by pumping seawater into it. This liquefaction should reduce the friction between {{grains of sand}} and in turn, friction between the ship and sand. Whether this would have <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> this case is unknown as Pasha Bulker was lying on rock as well as sand and the ship {{would have had to}} be pulled up and over the rocks.|$|E
25|$|Despite earlier controversy, by {{the time}} the first phase of {{construction}} was completed in 2000, it was generally agreed that the metro project was a success and has since become an essential part of life in Taipei. The system has <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> reducing traffic congestion in the city and has spurred the revival of satellite towns (like Tamsui) and development of new areas (like Nangang). The system has also helped to increase average vehicle speed for routes running from New Taipei into Taipei. Property prices along metro routes (both new and existing) tend to increase with the opening of more lines.|$|E
25|$|Mass-treatment {{programs}} that use topical permethrin or oral ivermectin have <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> reducing {{the prevalence of}} scabies {{in a number of}} populations. No vaccine is available for scabies. The simultaneous treatment of all close contacts is recommended, even if they show no symptoms of infection (asymptomatic), to reduce rates of recurrence. Since mites can survive for only two to three days without a host, other objects in the environment pose little risk of transmission except in the case of crusted scabies, thus cleaning is of little importance. Rooms used by those with crusted scabies require thorough cleaning.|$|E
50|$|While {{ethosuximide}} <b>is</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> treating only absence seizures, {{valproic acid}} <b>is</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> treating multiple seizure types including tonic-clonic seizure and partial seizure, {{as such it}} may be a better choice if a patient is exhibiting multiple types of seizures.Similarly, lamotrigine treats multiple seizure types including partial seizures and generalized seizures, therefore it is also an option for patients with multiple seizure types. Clonazepam (Klonopin, Rivotril) <b>is</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> the short term but is not generally recommended for treatment of absence seizure because of the rapid development of tolerance and high frequency of side effects.|$|R
