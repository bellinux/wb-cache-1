5|$|Gravitational-wave {{astronomy}} is {{an emerging}} field of astronomy that employs gravitational-wave detectors to collect observational data about distant massive objects. A few observatories have been constructed, {{such as the}} Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory LIGO. LIGO made its first detection on 14 September 2015, observing gravitational waves from a <b>binary</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole.</b> A second gravitational wave was detected on 26 December 2015 and additional observations should continue but gravitational waves require extremely sensitive instruments.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} gravitational-wave {{detectors}} {{have been built}} {{with the intent of}} directly detecting the gravitational waves emanating from such astronomical events as the merger of two neutron stars or black holes. In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had directly detected gravitational waves from a stellar <b>binary</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> merger, with additional detections announced in June 2016, June 2017, and August 2017.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 October 2017 the LIGO and Virgo collaborations {{announced}} {{the first ever}} detection of gravitational waves originating from the coalescence of a binary neutron star system. The observation of this GW170817 transient, which occurred on 17 August 2017, allowed for constraining the masses of the neutron stars involved between 0.86 and 2.26 solar masses. Further analysis allowed a greater restriction of the mass values to the interval, to 1.17–1.60 solar masses, with the total system mass measured to be 2.73–2.78 solar masses. [...] The inclusion of the Virgo detector in the observation effort allowed for an improvement of the localization of the source {{by a factor of}} 10. This in turn facilitated the electromagnetic follow-up of the event. In contrast to the case of <b>binary</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> mergers, binary neutron star mergers were expected to yield an electromagnetic counterpart, that is, a light signal associated with the event. A gamma-ray burst was detected by the space telescope Fermi (GRB 170817A), occurring 1.7 seconds after the gravitational wave transient. The signal, originating near the galaxy NGC 4993, was associated with the neutron star merger. This was corroborated by the electromagnetic follow-up of the event (AT 2017gfo), involving 70 telescopes and observatories and yielding observations over a large region of the electromagnetic spectrum which further confirmed the neutron star nature of the merged objects and the associated kilonova.|$|E
40|$|<b>Binary</b> <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> may form both through {{isolated}} binary {{evolution and}} through dynamical interactions in dense stellar environments. The formation channel leaves an imprint on the alignment between the <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> spins and the orbital angular momentum. Gravitational waves from these systems directly encode {{information about the}} spin [...] orbit misalignment angles, allowing them to be (weakly) constrained. Identifying sub-populations of spinning <b>binary</b> <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> will inform us about compact binary formation and evolution. We simulate a mixed population of <b>binary</b> <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> with spin [...] orbit misalignments modelled under a range of assumptions.

Assuming a population with dimensionless spin magnitudes of χ = 0. 7, we show that tens of observations will make it possible to distinguish the presence of subpopulations of coalescing <b>binary</b> <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> based on their spin orientations. With 100 observations {{it will be possible to}} infer the relative fraction of coalescing <b>binary</b> <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> with isotropic spin directions (corresponding to dynamical formation in our models) with a fractional uncertainty of ∼ 40 %. Meanwhile, only ∼ 5 observations are sufficient to distinguish between extreme models [...] -all <b>binary</b> <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> either having exactly aligned spins or isotropic spin directions.

2500|$|As first {{reported}} by Wired on October 17, 2007, an interesting application of using PlayStation 3 in a cluster configuration was implemented by Astrophysicist Gaurav Khanna, from the Physics department of University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, who replaced time used on supercomputers with {{a cluster of}} eight PlayStation 3s. [...] Subsequently, {{the next generation of}} this machine, now called the PlayStation 3 Gravity Grid, uses a network of 16 machines, and exploits the Cell processor for the intended application which is <b>binary</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> coalescence using perturbation theory. In particular, the cluster performs astrophysical simulations of large supermassive black holes capturing smaller compact objects and has generated numerical data that has been published multiple times in the relevant scientific research literature. The Cell processor version used by the PlayStation 3 has a main CPU and 6 SPEs available to the user, giving the Gravity Grid machine a net of 16 general-purpose processors and 96 vector processors. [...] The machine has a one-time cost of $9,000 to build and is adequate for black-hole simulations which would otherwise cost $6,000 per run on a conventional supercomputer. [...] The black hole calculations are not memory-intensive and are highly localizable, and so are well-suited to this architecture. Khanna claims that the cluster's performance exceeds that of a 100+ Intel Xeon core based traditional Linux cluster on his simulations. The PS3 Gravity Grid gathered significant media attention through 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.|$|E

40|$|The {{activity}} of active galaxy may {{be triggered by}} the merge of galaxies and present-day galaxies are probably the product of successive minor mergers. The frequent galactic merges at high redshift imply that active galaxy harbors supermassive unequal-mass <b>binary</b> <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> in its center at least once during its life time. The secondary <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> interacts and becomes coplanar with the accretion disk around the primary, inspiraling toward their mass center due {{to the loss of}} the orbit angular momentum to the disk mass outside the orbit of the secondary and/or to the gravitational radiation.

In this paper, we showed that the recently discovered double-lobed FR II radio galaxies are the remnants of such supermassive <b>binary</b> <b>black</b> <b>holes.</b> The inspiraling secondary <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> opens a gap in the accretion disk, which increases with time when the loss of the orbit angular momentum via gravitational radiation becomes dominated.

40|$|The {{detection}} of gravitational waves from {{the merger of}} <b>binary</b> <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> by the LIGO Collaboration has opened a new window to astrophysics. With the sensitivities of ground based detectors {{in the coming years}} we can only detect the local <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> <b>binary</b> mergers. The integrated merger rate can instead be probed by the gravitational-wave background, the incoherent superposition of the released energy in gravitational waves during binary-black-hole coalescence. Through that, the properties of the <b>binary</b> <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> can be studied. In this work we show that by measuring the energy density Ω_GW (in units of the cosmic critical density) of the gravitational-wave background, we can search for the rare ∼ 100 M_ massive <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> formed in the Universe. In addition, we can answer how often the least massive BHs of mass > 3 M_ form. Finally, if there are multiple channels for the formation of <b>binary</b> <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> and if any of them predicts a narrow mass range for the <b>black</b> <b>holes,</b> then the gravitational-wave-background spectrum may have features that with the future Einstein Telescope can be detected.

We focus on 2 D hydrodynamical studies of comparable-mass, non-spinning systems. Relativistic effects alter the dynamics of gas in this environment in several ways. Because the gravitational potential between the two <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> becomes shallower than in the Newtonian regime, the mini-disks stretch toward the L 1 point and the amount of gas passing {{back and forth between the}} mini-disks increases sharply with decreasing binary separation. This "sloshing" is quasi-periodically modulated at 2 and 2. 75 times the binary orbital frequency, corresponding to timescales of hours to days for supermassive <b>binary</b> <b>black</b> <b>holes.</b> In addition, relativistic effects add an m= 1 component to the tidally-driven spiral waves in the disks that are purely m= 2 in Newtonian gravity; this component becomes dominant when the separation is ≲ 100 gravitational radii. Both the sloshing and the spiral waves have the potential to create distinctive radiation features that may uniquely mark supermassive <b>binary</b> <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> in the relativistic regime.
