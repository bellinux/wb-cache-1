The economic theory of law claims that courts ought to require people to disclose secret information when that information was acquired as a by-product of other productive activity and {{to allow people to}} keep information secret when it was the product of significant investment. The contractarian theory argues that courts ought to (a) protect people from catastrophic losses, (<b>b)</b> require <b>disclosure</b> of secrets whose existence is not known to others, and (c) allow bargainers to keep visible secrets provided that their bargaining partners face roughly equal costs of acquiring the same information.

But how is this to be accomplished? A simple analytical model is developed to answer this question. The model demonstrates that getting environmental, economywide, industrial, and technology policies right is critical to cost-effective pollution, energy, and materials intensity reduction. With respect to environmental policy, two issues matter. First, {{it is important to}} develop a competent and tough environmental regulatory agency with clear legal authority to set quantitative environmental goals. Such an agency must also have a credible capacity to enforce compliance by reluctant polluters.

40|$|Introduction: Little {{is known}} about people {{diagnosed}} as HIV-positive who access HIV care early in their disease. In pre-ART studies published to date, {{only a minority of}} the participants have CD 4 &#x 003 E; 500 cells/&#x 00 B 5;l. Methods: This cross-sectional study compared individuals presenting for HIV care with CD 4 &#x 003 E; 500 cells/&#x 00 B 5;l, &#x 201 C;pre-ART&#x 201 D; (N= 247), with individuals who had CD 4 &# 60; 200 cells/&#x 00 B 5;l or WHO Stage IV, &#x 201 C;ART-eligible&#x 201 D; (N= 385). Baseline characteristics were contrasted between the two groups and logistic regression models used to explore group differences in: (a) being sexually active in the last month; (<b>b)</b> <b>disclosure</b> of HIV status to current partner; (c) knowing the HIV status of one&#x 0027;s current partner; and (d) condom use at last sex. Results: Pre-ART and ART-eligible individuals were similar in terms {{of a wide range of}} socio-demographic characteristics. Controlling for gender, only current sexual behaviour and HIV-testing history were significantly different between ART groups. In multivariable models, participants in the pre-ART group were twice as likely to be sexually active in the last month, OR 2. 06 95 % CI (1. 32, 3. 21), and to know their partner&#x 0027;s status, OR 1. 95 (1. 18, 3. 22) compared to those in the ART-eligible group. Self-reported disclosure of HIV status to current sexual partner (71 %), condom use at last sex (61 %) and HIV concordancy within relationships were not significantly different between the two ART groups. Overall, 39 % of the study participants reported knowing that they were in concordant HIV-positive relationships. Fifty-five percent of all participants reported not knowing their partner&#x 0027;s HIV status, only half of whom reported using a condom at last sex. Pre-ART individuals were significantly less likely to have tested HIV-positive for the first time in the last year and to have tested for sickness-related reasons than the ART-eligible group. Conclusions: Reported sexual risk behaviours by pre-ART individuals with CD 4 &#x 003 E; 500 cells/&#x 00 B 5;l suggest a continued risk of onward HIV transmission. There is a need for positive prevention efforts to target this group given that current treatment guidelines do not provide them with ART. Strengthening support regarding disclosure, partner HIV testing and consistent condom use, and further promotion of HIV testing in the community to assist earlier diagnosis are urgently required...|$|R
40|$|PTH upregulates the {{expression}} of the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (Rankl) in cells of the osteoblastic lineage, but the precise differentiation stage of the PTH target cell responsible for RANKL-mediated stimulation of bone resorption remains undefined. We report that constitutive activation of PTH receptor signaling only in osteocytes in transgenic mice (DMP 1 -caPTHR 1) was sufficient to increase Rankl expression and bone resorption. Resorption in DMP 1 -caPTHR 1 mice crossed with mice lacking the distal control region regulated by PTH in the Rankl gene (DCR(-/-)) was similar to DMP 1 -caPTHR 1 mice at 1 month of age, but progressively declined to reach values undistinguishable from wild-type (WT) mice at 5 months of age. Moreover, DMP 1 -caPTHR 1 mice exhibited low tissue material density and increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity at 5 month of age, and these indices of high remodeling were partially and totally corrected in compound DMP 1 -caPTHR 1;DCR(-/-) male mice, and less affected in female mice. Rankl expression in bones from DMP 1 -caPTHR 1 mice was elevated at both 1 and 5 months of age, whereas it was high, similar to DMP 1 -caPTHR 1 mice at 1 month, but low, similar to WT levels at 5 months in compound mice. Moreover, PTH increased Rankl and decreased Sost and Opg expression in ex vivo bone organ cultures established from WT mice, but only regulated Sost and Opg expression in cultures from DCR(-/-) mice. PTH also increased RANKL expression in osteocyte-containing primary cultures of calvarial cells, in isolated murine osteocytes, and in WT but not in DCR(-/-) osteocyte-enriched bones. Thus, PTH upregulates Rankl expression in osteocytes in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo, and resorption induced by PTH receptor signaling in the adult skeleton requires direct regulation of the Rankl gene in osteocytes.

40|$|The article {{concerns}} the theorization of shareholder responsibility and ethical investing. The article develops the following arguments, among others: If public corporations pursue stockholder profits “pathologically,” as claimed by some critical scholars, {{it is not}} because of any obligation arising under corporate law, but because the pursuit of stockholder profits is congenial to the stockholders. For this reason (and others discussed in the article), shareholders have an ethical stake in the conduct of corporate business, quite apart from any notion that shareholders “own” the corporation. A phenomenon which the article terms “bounded empathy,” analogous to “bounded rationality”, can help to explain why, in practice, shareholders’ sense of ethical engagement is more limited than one might wish. Although unimpeachable {{from the standpoint of the}} “nexus of contracts” conception of the corporation, the concept of ethical investing is awkward for corporate law theorists who advocate a rule of exclusive profit-maximization. These theorists respond by characterizing ethical investing as either irrational and aberrant, or else rational and pernicious, both of which characterizations are misguided. The article also considers the implications of the foregoing for two concrete questions arising under corporate law in connection with ethical investing, specifically (a) whether the law should filter out ethically-motivated shareholder proposals; and (<b>b)</b> whether <b>disclosure</b> of matters relevant to ethical analysis of corporate conduct should be mandatory...|$|R

This paper examines the conflicting incentives, both national and European, faced by {{firms in the}} European Union (EU) when complying with IFRS mandatory disclosures. The {{purpose of the study}} was to test Ball 2 ̆ 7 s (2006) assertion that international companies used one of two tiers of IFRS compliance: (a) boilerplate disclosures that present a veneer of uniformity with no national enforcement or (<b>b)</b> detailed <b>disclosures</b> backed by a national enforcement regime.

This study compared compliance levels for the original EU 15 member nations with New Member States (NMS). The key findings were that most EU companies did comply in form with Level 1 IFRS disclosures regardless of the country of origin or the level of enforcement. An ADR Listing was very important in predicting Level 1 Compliance. For Level 2, compliance in substance, companies from the EU 15 member states and from stronger enforcement regimes had better compliance than those companies from NMS or weaker enforcement regimes. Having a Big 4 auditor and an ADR listing also had a positive influence on Level 2 Compliance...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{enormous}} {{research on}} the experience of living with HIV, many questions remain regarding self-disclosure of HIV status to sexual partners by people living with HIV (PLWHIV), which is essential to reducing further infection. In this study, a phenomenological approach captured the experience of self-disclosure among South Africans living with HIV in Louwsburg, South Africa. The health belief model served as a theoretical framework, and in-depth interviews were conducted with 12 PLWHIV (8 women, 4 men) who self-disclosed their HIV status to their sexual partners. Their experiences were explored, discovering their illness, motives for self-disclosure, feelings regarding disclosing, responses of their sexual partners, their emotional reaction, and about their medical care. The themes rose from interviews showed that (a) many PLWHIV are reluctant to self-disclose until they actively experienced health issues; (<b>b)</b> motives for <b>disclosure</b> include the wish to ensure fairness; support and to empower other PLWHIV to prevent further infection; (c) feelings of disclosure are primarily relief and liberation, even though risks remain, especially for families separated by labor migration laws; (d) the response of sexual partners to disclosure varies widely; some are motivated to get tested and use condoms, decline and respond only with anger, blame, even abandonment; and (e) after accessing medical care, most PLWHIV reported support and appearing less sick, which reduces social stigma. The women were more open, forthcoming, and transparent about disclosing than men participants. Findings will assist with the creation of future health education programs aimed at creating safe environments to disclose HIV status, which may reduce community risk of contracting the virus...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} exploring therapist self disclosure (TSD) {{indicates that}} when therapeutically relevant and used sparingly {{it can have}} a beneficial effect for the client, particularly when the client {{is a member of}} a stigmatised population. There are several limitations to the current literature including the failure to consider contextual variables that may influence the decision making process behind TSD and its impact. The quantitative methodology has mostly utilised analogue designs which may fail to capture the complexity of the topic when applied to clinical practice. There is a dearth of literature exploring the experience of disclosing {{from the perspective of the}} clinician. The current study sought to bridge this gap by utilising a qualitative methodology, Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), to explore the experiences of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) mental health practitioners disclosing sexual orientation to clients. Eight self identifying LGB clinicians within Leicester Partnership Trust with experiences of disclosing sexual orientation to clients were interviewed for this study. Analysis revealed five super-ordinate themes; a) not just another <b>disclosure</b> <b>b)</b> reaching a make or break disclosure decision c) the experience of disclosing d) the enhancing effects of disclosure and e) the cost of concealment. Each super-ordinate theme contained three sub-ordinate themes. Overall the analysis revealed that disclosing sexuality is a complex, risky and meaning laden experience that requires careful consideration of the potential costs and benefits to the client, clinician and relationship. When a considered disclosure was made the participants experienced enhancing effects. A negative impact was experienced when they felt the need to conceal their sexual orientation. Clearly a complex process, disclosures of this nature were usually infrequent and done with the best interests of the clients and relationship in mind. Strengths and weaknesses of the study and suggestions for further research are discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Research {{examining}} {{explicit and}} implicit disclosures {{have been at}} beat few and far between. While disclosures have been examined in many areas, including reciprocity, intimacy level, and sex, little consideration {{has been given to}} these two specific types of disclosures. While other studies have examined the nonverbal effects of privacy violations and privacy restoration, few if any studies have examined how nonverbal behaviors function in disclosures, specifically explicit and implicit disclosures and how they serve to create a coordinated boundary management. This study was designed to: (a) to determine what nonverbal immediacy behaviors are used in explicit and implicit <b>disclosures,</b> (<b>b)</b> to explore the immediacy behaviors used in receiving explicit and implicit disclosures, and (c) to develop Communication Boundary Management Theory through the examination of immediacy behaviors. The overarching question raised in this study was: What are the nonverbal behaviors used in the sending and receipt of explicit and implicit disclosures of romantically involved, heterosexual couples? ^ One hundred and ten students (fifty-five romantically involved couples) were asked to discuss with each other one or all of several topics provided by the researcher. Both partners reviewed a videotaped interaction of them disclosing and were asked to indicate beginning and ending points of their disclosures as well as type of disclosure. From the videotape, coders rated the nonverbal immediacy behaviors. Results found that in sending and receiving both explicit and implicit disclosures, the most prevalent behavior expressed by participants was maintaining a direct facial-orientation toward their partners. The least prevalent behaviors for both sexes included animated and frequent gesturing and head nodding. Despite, overall expressing more immediacy than men, women maintained a closed body position throughout the disclosures. Results of disclosive boundary coordination are also presented. ...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{considers}} {{the interplay between}} new auditing standards governing audits of internal control over financial reporting and pre-existing legal standards governing auditor liability for audit failure. The interplay produces skewed liability incentives that, if unadjusted, threaten to impair {{the objective of this}} new control-audit regime. The regime 2 ̆ 7 s objective is, in part, to provide an early warning to financial statement users when current financial statements are reliable but control weaknesses indicate material risk of a company 2 ̆ 7 s future inability to produce reliable financial statements. To be meaningful, auditor disclosure of material weaknesses and potential effects is necessary. While liability rules under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 will reinforce auditor incentives to provide this disclosure, liability rules under Section 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 will discourage auditors from providing disclosure because doing so likely makes them primary actors subject to liability rather than secondary actors not subject to liability. To address this skewed interplay between new auditing standards and pre-existing legal liability rules, the Article suggests developing a safe harbor system to protect from Section 10 (<b>b)</b> liability auditor <b>disclosure</b> of forward-looking information necessary to give the early warning system meaning. The Article gives a comprehensive account of new auditing standards, noting interpretive questions, and showing a system entirely dependent on extensive auditor disclosure. It then explains how the new system expressly nullifies existing case law under Section 11 by substantially expanding required auditor disclosure of internal control conclusions and how it probably nullifies existing case law under Section 10 (b), including the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s landmark 1994 case, Central Bank, that generally insulated auditors from Section 10 (b) liability. These effects, remarkable on their own, pose limits on the early warning system 2 ̆ 7 s promise and the Article suggests using safe harbors to overcome them. The Article also offers broader but brief criticism of current preoccupation with control effectiveness as the key to reliable financial reporting evident in auditing 2 ̆ 7 s otherwise appealing new early warning system...|$|R
40|$|The {{scholarly}} literature surrounding counselor supervision {{suggests that}} relational bonds built on liking, trusting, and caring between supervisors and counselors positively impact counselor willingness to disclose practice errors and ethical issues in supervision. This Delphi study explored {{the opinions of}} expert public rehabilitation supervisors regarding issues that affect the development and maintenance of relational bonds, {{as well as what}} factors affect counselor willingness to disclose in supervision, particularly minor ethical issues that may become more serious if not openly addressed. Forty-three supervisors who met the study criteria for experts were nominated for participation by TACE directors and public VR administrators. Expert criteria included five or more years of counselor supervision experience, possession of a Master 2 ̆ 7 s degree in Rehabilitation Counseling or related fields, and previous supervision training. This Delphi study was designed to solicit the insights of expert supervisors and add to the base of research knowledge concerning counselor supervision. The study is significant because it is {{the first of its kind}} to be pursued exclusively among public rehabilitation supervisors exploring how relational bonds, counselor disclosure, and ethics are integrated into rehabilitation counseling practice. Experts submitted their input using online questionnaires and were anonymous to other group members. In Round One, experts answered four open-ended questions regarding bonds and disclosure. In Rounds Two and Three, they ranked the importance of 39 Likert-scaled questions developed from Round One responses. Means and standard deviations were calculated for each round, and significance was tested using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The major findings of this Delphi study were that trust has the most impact on the development of relational bonds, and that anticipated supervisor reactions are the biggest factor in counselor disclosure. Experts rated availability and fairness as the most important factors for bond development, and cultivation of trust as the highest-ranked strategy for facilitating disclosure. Experts ranked counselor fear of recrimination of lower importance than the literature indicates. The extent of expert understanding regarding the differences between egregious and non-egregious ethical behaviors was unclear. Suggestions for further investigation include (a) a Delphi study of expert rehabilitation counselors regarding bonds and <b>disclosure,</b> (<b>b)</b> examining supervisor needs for support from administration, (c) continuing education for supervisors and counselors regarding non-egregious ethical errors, and (d) reviewing ethics training opportunities for non-CRC supervisors and counselors in public rehabilitation agencies...|$|R
