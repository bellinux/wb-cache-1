2500|$|A common {{framework}} used in {{the analysis}} of medical ethics is the [...] "four principles" [...] approach postulated by Tom Beauchamp and James Childress in their textbook Principles of <b>biomedical</b> <b>ethics.</b> It recognizes four basic moral principles, which are to be judged and weighed against each other, with attention given to the scope of their application.

2500|$|Neuroethics {{encompasses}} {{a wide range}} of issues, which can only be sampled here.

[...] How safe are the drugs used to enhance normal brain function? [...] These are neuroethical issues with clear precedents in traditional bioethics. [...] They are important issues, and luckily we can call upon society's experience with the relevant precedents to help determine the best courses of action in the present cases. [...] In contrast, many neuroethical issues are at least partly novel, and this accounts for some of the intellectual fascination of neuroethics. [...] These relatively newer issues force us to think about the relation between mind and brain and its ethical implications.|$|E
40|$|Scholars {{claim that}} the {{outcomes}} of health interventions are the products of three factors: the size, the penetration and the sustainability of their effects. Nonetheless, the prevailing <b>biomedical</b> <b>ethic</b> of care engenders a mere ‘fix-it’ approach, which focuses on the clinical treatment {{of the disease and}} neglects the role of patients in the process of care. This approach undermines both the size and the penetration of health interventions. From this standpoint, the authors examine different health interventions aimed at improving the size and the penetration of their effects through the empowerment of the patients and their involvement in the provision of care. They are confronted in terms of two different criteria: the ‘intensity’ of the health care co-production and the ‘breadth’ of the health-related needs contemplated. Besides, their outcomes—in terms of health status improvement, patients’ satisfaction and cost savings—have been contrasted. A detailed case study dealing with a pilot project launched in Italy, which involved full-fledged empowerment of the patient, is presented. It is compared with similar initiatives carried out in other European and non-European countries, with the purpose of stressing the peculiarities of the former and explaining the reasons for its success. The findings of this study support the exploratory hypothesis that the higher the intensity of co-production and the wider the breadth of health-related needs considered, the better the outcomes of health interventions...|$|R

40|$|Family {{communication}} about adult-onset hereditary illness can be problematic, {{leaving some}} relatives inadequately informed or ignorant of their risk. Although studies have explored the barriers and facilitators in family communication about genetic risk, questions remain about when, what, how and indeed whether to tell relatives. The process of disclosure is also {{dependent upon the}} way in which genetic information is realized and understood by recipients, but research here is limited. Our paper explores young people’s experiences of finding out about a family history of the hereditary disorder Huntington’s disease (HD). In-depth interviews explored how and when young people found out, their reactions to different communication styles and any impact on family relations. We recruited young people through the North of Scotland regional genetics clinic and the Scottish Huntington’s Association (SHA). Thirtythree young people (aged 9 – 28) were interviewed. A qualitative analysis was undertaken which revealed four types of disclosure experiences: (1) having always been told, (2) gradually told, (3) HD was kept a secret, or (4) HD as a new diagnosis. In particular, the timing and style of disclosure from relatives, and one’s stage of awareness, were fundamental in structuring participants’ accounts. This article focuses on questions of when, how and indeed whether to tell children, and sits within a broader set of research and practice issues about what professionals and families (should) tell children about parental illness and genetic risk.

Kapoor and colleagues identify {{several of the}} practical and ethics dilemmas that they have encountered in editing The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law. <b>Biomedical</b> publishing <b>ethics</b> is continually evolving, with discrepant practice among different publications.

40|$|Bulger? Responsible {{conduct of}} {{research}} When attempting {{to identify the}} norms for the responsible conduct in biomedical research, {{it is important to}} identify areas in which scientists have come to some agreement on what are accepted norms and areas in which such consensus has not been reached. It is also important to understand the principles that underlie such norms. Just as the Belmont Report (Department of Health Education and Welfare 1979) provided three guiding principles for research involving human participants (respect for persons, beneficence and justice), the principles underlying <b>biomedical</b> research <b>ethics</b> also need be to elucidated. In an attempt to move toward defining these underlying principles for the responsible conduct of research, Bulger (1994) has suggested a possible way to classify responsibilities according to four guiding principles. She proposes the first principle as a constellation of values including honesty, integrity, truthfulness and objectivity in the way that scientists plan, execute, record, interpret and publish thei...|$|R
40|$|Islam, its {{texts and}} lived practice, finds growing {{importance}} within the global discourse on bioethics, {{as there is}} an increasing Muslim population and burgeoning interest in biomedical research and biotechnologies in the Muslim world. The aim of this thesis is to assess if and how Islam influences the ethical decision making of researchers, REC (researcher ethics committee) members, guideline developers and Islamic scholars in the biomedical research context. I began addressing this question by first reviewing the literature that has been published to explore the role that Islam plays {{in the literature on}} <b>biomedical</b> research <b>ethics.</b> There is evidence that some Muslim countries have developed "Islamic" guidelines. That is, guidelines with the explicit aim of setting out Islamic values and stating their relevance to the ethics of research. A review of research guidelines employed within countries with a significant Muslim population, was carried out, to investigate the role of Islam in such guidelines. The literature and guideline review revealed that although international guidelines have been adapted to incorporate Islamic views, {{studies have shown that the}} latter are of limited practical application within a "Muslim country" setting. An empirical study was carried out in two case study sites to assess the extent to which Islam influences ethical decision making within the context of biomedical research. 56 semi-structured interviews were carried out in Malaysia (38) and Iran (18) with researchers, REC members, guideline developers and Islamic scholars to understand whether Islam influences what they consider to be an ethico-legal problem, and if the latter emerges, then how such issues are addressed. The empirical study indicates five main conclusions. The first is that Islam and its institutional forms do impact ethical decision making in the day-to-day practice of biomedical research in countries with a Muslim population and/or in the research careers of Muslim researchers. Secondly, it shows that there are many distinctive mechanisms, such as the involvement of Islamic scholars, the process of ijtihad (independent reasoning) and the production of fatawah (legal edicts), by which Islam does identify and develop ethical views about biomedical matters. Thirdly, HIV/AIDS poses major challenges to the world of Islam as it does the rest of world. The epidemic raises issues that touch on cultural sensitivities that are important to Islamic societies and this study has shown that no simple or single response was observed to the ethical issues arising from HIV/AIDS. Fourthly, researchers face practical challenges when deliberating womenâs autonomy in contexts where Islam is appropriated within âmale dominatedâ contexts. The role and status of women is disputed in such contexts with views ranging from women needing their husbandâs permission to leave the home to men and women having equal freedoms. Finally, this study describes and analyses how the personal faith of researchers and their deep commitment to Islamic ethics and law influences their understanding of their legal and moral accountability and ethico-legal decision making. It shows that researchers adopt multiple roles and are required to balance numerous value systems and priorities and face moral anxiety and frustration when these different moral sources are in conflict. Overall, this study indicates that, in the countries studied, Islam does influence <b>biomedical</b> research <b>ethics,</b> and that this can be appreciated through the growing reference to Islam and its scriptural sources in <b>biomedical</b> research <b>ethics</b> literature, research ethics guidelines and the role of Islam in the day-to-day practice of biomedical researchers in the case study sites, that has been captured in the empirical study. </p...|$|R

40|$|In October 2005, UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) {{adopted the}} Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights. This was the {{culmination}} of nearly 2  years of deliberations and negotiations. As a non-binding instrument, the declaration must be incorporated by UNESCO’s member states into their national laws, regulations or policies in order to take effect. Based on documentary evidence and data from interviews, this paper compares the declaration’s universal principles with national bioethics guidelines and practice in Kenya and South Africa. It concentrates on areas of particular relevance to developing countries, such as protection of vulnerable persons and social responsibility. The comparison demonstrates the need for universal principles to be contextualised before they can be applied in a meaningful sense at national level. The paper also assesses the ‘added value’ of the declaration in terms of <b>biomedical</b> research <b>ethics,</b> given that there are already well-established international instruments on bioethics, namely the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and the CIOMS (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences) guidelines on biomedical research.
