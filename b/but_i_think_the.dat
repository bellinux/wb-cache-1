We've {{created a lot of}} good songs, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{difference}} between us is probably the reason why I've started this new band. I've made a lot of my favourite songs that I've created in God Seed and I've brought with me one of these characters from that band.|$|E
25|$|We clam {{up and get}} tense. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{national}} {{show will}} improve {{in the next few}} weeks. We want to include the best segments of IMT in the national show. IMT is a lot more spontaneous than the national show – we've run up to an hour overtime. We like to get the audience to participate and if we can find someone interesting in the studio audience we throw away our scripts and just adlib.|$|E
25|$|The storyline {{reached its}} climax in March 2003. On-screen the character’s plans to abscond with Ricky {{and her son}} (on the night of her {{surprise}} birthday party) were thwarted by Barry’s discovery of the affair – leading to a public confrontation between the three protagonists. Shaun Williamson who played Barry has commented “Barry is absolutely devastated as his whole life is ripped apart. He can’t believe Nat has betrayed him. He loves his life with Natalie and Jack, and {{would do anything to}} make it work as a family again. Losing Natalie is going to be really difficult for Barry, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> hardest thing will be losing his son.” The storyline signified the end of the characters’ three-year marriage and in a final plot twist Natalie opted to finish with Ricky and leave Walford alone, having discovered that he had recently slept with his ex-wife Samantha.|$|E

500|$|Producer Paul Rabwin was displeased {{with the}} final episode, noting, [...] "'Badlaa' was the one episode I {{did not like the}} most [...] I think if I had done it different, I would have had John Shiban change the method of transportation. I don't think it ever worked on any level for me. It was just weird and creepy, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> whole idea was distasteful to me." [...] He later bluntly {{concluded}} that [...] "it's the only episode that I kind of wish we hadn't done." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 2, 2015, Paul {{generated}} controversy {{by suggesting}} that states should not require parents to vaccinate their children, because parents should {{have the freedom to}} make that decision for their children. In an interview with CNBC on February 2, Paul clarified this statement, commenting [...] "I'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea. I think they are a good thing, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> parent should have some input. The state doesn't own your children. Parents own the children, and it is an issue of freedom." [...] On February 3, he posted a photograph to Twitter of himself being vaccinated.|$|E
500|$|... "Amber 31422" [...] was {{the first}} project guest actors and {{brothers}} Shawn Ashmore and Aaron Ashmore had worked on together in fifteen years. Shawn {{said in an interview}} that [...] "it’s usually because the stuff that came along is kind of hokey, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> quality of Fringe is really high and the episode is done well and our characters are intelligent. We’re going to have some fun." [...] Holly Dignard guest starred as Danielle Rose, while recurring guest actors Amy Madigan and Ryan McDonald returned as Marilyn Dunham and Brandon Fayette, respectively. Seth Gabel and former series regular Kirk Acevedo reprised their characters Lincoln Lee and Charlie Francis, Fringe Division agents from the Other Side.|$|E

500|$|In the {{beginning}} {{it took me a}} little while {{to get used to the}} new idea of the sound, not having any screaming vocals and stuff like that. [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> album was necessary for us to do. Maybe the band wouldn't have continued if we hadn't done Heritage. [...] I think the old Opeth fans understand this album. There's always going to be some haters, but you can't be loved by everyone. Opeth has always been about not repeating ourself. A lot of people don't think Heritage is metal but I think it's metal to go somewhere people don't expect. It doesn't mean we're not embracing the past sound of Opeth.|$|E
500|$|DecembeRadio felt {{pressure}} to meet growing expectations following the accolades received for their previous album, DecembeRadio (2006), which won a Gospel Music Association Dove Award and {{was nominated for}} a Grammy Award. [...] "We had some great stuff go on with the first record, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> biggest thing {{over the past two years}} has been trying to make sure Satisfied is not a sophomore slump" [...] said lead guitarist Brian Bunn. [...] While the self-titled album was written and recorded with little thought to how the songs would translate in concert, the experience of opening for Third Day helped DecembeRadio learn what works best live. [...] Thus it was the band's goal to [...] "make sure every single song on the [...] album worked well in a live concert setting", according to Bunn.|$|E
500|$|In July 2016 it was {{revealed}} that Fichtner would not be reprising his role as Mahone in the upcoming fifth season. Robert Knepper told Digital Spy that [...] " [...] Paul Scheuring loves Bill Fichtner and I love Bill Fichtner. He's a brilliant actor – but Paul honestly said to me, 'I don't {{know what to do with}} that character'. He didn't want to just bring everybody back, so that the audience go, 'Oh, look, it's Bill Fichtner again!' – he honestly thought, 'I'm not sure where to do that in the plot.' So if someday there's another chapter of this, maybe then Bill will be back. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> characters that are there, each of our moments that we have, are key to the storytelling, which is how it should be." ...|$|E

500|$|Renwick {{has stated}} that the {{production}} of any further Jonathan Creek specials will depend on reception to [...] "The Grinning Man", {{as well as his}} own schedule. Davies is amenable to reprising the lead role in future, stating: [...] "If David writes more, I'm happy to do them. Unless they turned up and they were awful - but it hasn't happened so far. And he wouldn't send me an awful one anyway. But I don't know if he will come up with another one. He always says that the writing is so difficult, I'm not sure it gives him any pleasure. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> shooting gave him a lot of pleasure this time. He was directing {{for the first time and}} I think he really enjoyed it. So, we'll see." ...|$|E
500|$|Lehto {{recalled}} that making a character-driven story {{was a great}} challenge—players would come {{to know more about}} them as they progressed through the campaign, but the Spartan characters also had to behave intelligently. [...] "The Halo games consistently featured protagonists that were silent during gameplay sequences. Community manager Brian Jarrard pushed for allowing players to choose a female Noble Six and have the cinematics and dialogue change accordingly. The post-credit game sequence was the subject of intense discussion; some at Bungie wanted to remove it. Executive producer Joe Tung noted, [...] "the 'survive' component ... felt great to us. We definitely talked about different versions of how that was happening and different versions of ending [...] cinematically, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> way that it ultimately ended up is just a really well-paced, significant and emotionally impactful ending." ...|$|E
500|$|And the Band Played On was {{critically}} acclaimed {{and became a}} best-seller. Judith Eannarino of the Library Journal called it [...] "one {{of the most important}} books of the year", upon its release. It made Shilts both a star and a pariah for his coverage of the disease and the bitter politics in the gay community. He described his motivation to undertake the writing of the book in an interview after its release, saying, [...] "Any good reporter could have done this story, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> reason I did it, and no one else did, is because I am gay. It was happening to people I cared about and loved." [...] The book was later adapted into an HBO film of the same name in 1993. Shilts was tested for HIV while he was writing the book; he died of complications from AIDS in 1994.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{who gave}} Wipeout 3 lower marks noted {{a sense of}} {{disappointment}} that the series broke little new ground. Stuart Miles of The Times admitted Wipeout 3 was a good game, but {{felt that he had}} been expecting much more from the sequel: [...] "It's as if the programmers have concerned themselves more with the overall look and feel, rather than further developing the existing gameplay." [...] Alistair Wallace of Gamasutra, in a retrospective on Wipeout 2097, remembered that [...] "I enjoyed [...] because it was more of the same and I loved it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> series ran out of its innovation. Doing loop the loops isn't a big deal really." [...] GameSpot summed up its review of the game by judging Wipeout 3 an excellent racer, but not able to beat Wipeout 2097 as the best futuristic racing game of all time.|$|E
500|$|In a June 2009 {{interview}} with Italy's Rock TV, Ulrich said Metallica {{was planning to}} continue touring until August 2010, {{and that there were}} no plans for a tenth album. He said he was sure the band would collaborate with producer Rick Rubin again. According to Blabbermouth.net, the band was considering recording its next album {{in the second half of}} 2011. In November 2010, during an {{interview with}} The Pulse of Radio, Ulrich said Metallica would return to writing in 2011. Ulrich said, [...] "There's a bunch of balls in the air for 2011, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> main one is we really want to get back to writing again. We haven't really written since, what, '06, '07, and we want to get back to kind of just being creative again. Right now we are going to just chill out and then probably start up again in, I'd say, March or April, and start probably putting the creative cap back on and start writing some songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Mason said {{he hoped}} that his storyline would [...] "draw in viewers in a {{responsible}} way" [...] and the feedback would stay positive. Mason added {{that he would like}} to see Chris happy in the future and hopes the viewers will warm to him. He added [...] "I know it's quite a sensitive topic, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> difference between his and the last encounters they've had is that we're looking more in-depth into more than just a [...] "gay kiss". We go more into the relationships, how it affects people around". Steele backed this up, saying [...] "We wanted gay to be part of Chris's character, not Chris to be the gay character. He's not your typical gay stereotype that some TV shows like to play up. He's on the basketball team, he's had a girlfriend for a time, and I think the show does a good job of portraying the way his character is discovering who he really is".|$|E

500|$|Murphy {{selected}} [...] "Defying Gravity" [...] for {{the episode}} after Colfer relayed {{a story from}} his own high school days, whereby his drama teacher refused to let him sing the song because of his sex. Murphy explained: [...] "I {{found a way to}} write it into the show because that's in a nutshell what this show is about: someone being told that they can't do something because of what the perception of them is as opposed to what their real ability is." [...] Colfer stated that the opportunity to finally sing the song [...] "really meant the world" [...] to him, and that: [...] "It's absolutely terrifying to watch yourself do something you've dreamed about for such a long time. I know I'm definitely not the best singer, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> message, the story behind the song about defying limits and borders placed by others, hopefully all that gets across with the performance. Although I do some very 'Kurtsy' things in the song, it's {{probably one of the most}} honest and close-to-heart scenes I've ever filmed or performed for that matter." ...|$|E
500|$|The novel {{carried the}} unusual credit of [...] "Sebastian Faulks writing as Ian Fleming" [...] and Faulks {{described}} how—using Fleming's article—he had employed the same style as Fleming {{did in his}} novels: [...] "it's standard journalistic: no semicolons, few adverbs, few adjectives, short sentences, a lot of verbs, a lot of concrete nouns. These are the tools, and that's literally the style." [...] Faulks also commented that [...] "some people find it perplexing <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> way that the book has been presented... is a clever way of showing {{that it is not}} my book, although, of course, it is my book." [...] A large part of Devil May Care is set in Persia (now Iran); it was an area Fleming had not previously dealt with in his Bond novels, describing it as [...] "full of thieves and crooks". Faulks said of his choice of location that Fleming [...] "didn't set any of his books there, which is surprising in some ways because Lebanon in the 60s would have made a great setting for a Bond story. But his loss is my gain.".|$|E
500|$|During {{a repeat}} of the {{previous}} year's final on 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties after a 0–0 deadlock, resulting in Messi's third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. After the match, Messi, who had missed his penalty in the shootout, announced his retirement from international football. Sources reported that other Argentine players – Sergio Agüero, Javier Mascherano, Gonzalo Higuaín, Lucas Biglia, Éver Banega, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Ángel Di María – could follow their captain in retiring from international football. Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said after the match, [...] "My generation can't compare him to Maradona that's for my generation, because of what Maradona did for Argentine football. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> best player ever played today here in the United States." [...] Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3); he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis Sánchez.|$|E
