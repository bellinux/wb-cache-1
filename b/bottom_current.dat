40|$|Research highlights: - Topographic {{obstacles}} have {{a profound}} effect on sedimentation patterns. When <b>bottom</b> <b>currents</b> encounter topographic obstacles, they focus and intensify, leading to sediment drifts at the base. Along the tectonic ridges of the Atlantic Moroccan margin, 11 ° is the threshold for sediment drift formation, while along the mud volcanoes, sediment drifts are present at the southern and/or northern side and are related to the size of the mud volcano. - Internal tides play an important role in the build-up of sediment drifts. Although the sediment drifts along the Atlantic Moroccan margin were mainly driven by glacial water masses, internal tidal currents play an important role in their development. They are driving long-term <b>bottom</b> <b>currents</b> and consequently influence sediment drift deposition along the tectonic ridges and mud volcanoes. Sediment drifts created or influenced by internal tidal currents could be named tidal sediment drifts and a limited extent is proposed. - Coral mound build-up is related to climatic changes and interferes with its immediate surroundings. The Atlantic Moroccan coral province is the largest discovered coral mound province in the world so far and possesses stratigraphic evidence, 10 different initiation horizons in the subsurface, of climate-dependant growth cycles of cold-water corals. Small-scale sediment drifts are created around some of the coral mounds, evidencing deviated and intensified <b>bottom</b> <b>currents.</b> This creates elevated fluxes of food particles and sediment towards the corals, allowing proliferation. - Diagnostic criteria for contourites could be developed based on CT analyses of sediment cores. A workflow for analysing CT-scans, based on the grey values within the radiographs, of sediment cores has been developed which can aid in the discovery of diagnostic criteria to distinguish contourites from turbidites and pelagites.

The Portofino separated mounded drift has a maximum thickness of at least 150 m and occurs in an area of mean current velocity minimum. Independent evidence to support the interpretation include <b>bottom</b> <b>current</b> modelling, seafloor morphology, seismic reflection geometry and sediment core facies.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} both {{an introduction}} to and summary for the Atlas of Contourite Systems that has been compiled {{as part of the}} International Geological Correlation Project - IGCP 432. Following the seminal works of George Wust on the physical oceanography of bottom currents, and Charley Hollister on contourite sediments, a series of significant advances have been made over the past few decades. While accepting that ideas and terms must remain flexible as our knowledge base continues to increase, we present a consensus view on terminology and definitions of bottom currents, contourites and drifts. Both thermohaline and wind-driven circulation, influenced by Coriolis Force and molded by topography, contribute to the oceanic system of bottom currents. These semi-permanent currents show significant variability in time and space, marked by periodic benthic storm events in areas of high surface kinetic energy. Six different drift types are recognized in the ocean basins and margins at depths greater than about 300 m: (i) contourite sheet drifts; (ii) elongate mounded drifts; (iii) channel related drifts; (iv) confined drifts; (v) infill drifts; and (vi) modified drift-turbidite systems. In addition to this overall geometry, their chief seismic characteristics include: a uniform reflector pattern that reflects long-term stability, drift-wide erosional discontinuities caused by periodic changes in <b>bottom</b> <b>current</b> regime, and stacked broadly lenticular seismic depositional units showing oblique to downcurrent migration. At a smaller scale, a variety of seismic facies can be recognized that are here related to <b>bottom</b> <b>current</b> intensity. A model for seismic facies cyclicity (alternating transparent/reflector zones) is further elaborated, and linked to bottom current/climate change. Both erosional features and depositional bedforms are diagnostic of <b>bottom</b> <b>current</b> systems and velocities. Many different contourite facies are now known to exist, encompassing all compositional types. We propose here a Cl- 5 notation for the standard contourite facies sequence, which can be interpreted in terms of fluctuation in <b>bottom</b> <b>current</b> velocity and/or sediment supply. Several proxies can be utilized to decode contourite successions in terms of current fluctuation. Gravel lag and shale chip contourites, as well as erosional discontinuities are indicative of still greater velocities. There are a small but growing number of land-based examples of fossil contourites, based on careful analysis using the recommended three-stage approach to interpretation. Debate still surrounds the recognition and interpretation of <b>bottom</b> <b>current</b> reworked turbidites...|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{processes}} and phases of deep-sea sediment drift formation {{is essential for}} a reconstruction of their evolution. This leads {{to a better understanding}} of the properties of oceanographic currents active during drift formation and in turn to information on the climatic conditions. A system of sediment drifts at the Antarctic Peninsula Pacific rise has been chosen to learn more about the Neogene evolution of both current systems and palaeo-climate in that area. Drift 7 was extensively surveyed (seismic and sampling), and two ODP Leg 178 sites were drilled there. Using this information maps of reflectors depth and seismic unit thickness were compiled and interpreted regarding the controlling depositional processes. The depositional model shows an initially major along-slope sediment transport by a SW-setting <b>bottom</b> <b>current</b> (25 - 15 Ma), which deflected sediment supplied from the continental shelf.

Down-slope transport has decreased since 9. 5 Ma, but a re-onset of the <b>bottom</b> <b>current</b> can only be observed since 5. 3 Ma.

40|$|Sedimentological and faunal {{records from}} the {{transitional}} period marking the onset of widespread northern hemisphere glaciation have been investigated at Ocean Drilling Program Site 984. The late Pliocene interglacial sediments of the northeast Atlantic are carbonate rich and show evidence of vigorous bottom water circulation at intermediate water depths. Contrasting this, the late Pliocene glacial sediments are characterised by carbonate dissolution and slower <b>bottom</b> <b>current</b> velocities. Weak or "leaky" Norwegian Sea overflows, undersaturated with respect to carbonate, influenced this region during the late Pliocene glacials. The early Pleistocene pattern of intermediate water circulation appears to have changed radically in the northeast Atlantic. At this time, interglacial carbonate values and inferred <b>bottom</b> <b>current</b> velocities are low. This suggests slow-flowing, undersaturated Norwegian Sea water bathing the site. The overflow increased during the early Pleistocene interglacials as the exchange between the Atlantic and Norwegian-Greenland Seas improved. The most significant feature of the early Pleistocene glacials is the increase in inferred <b>bottom</b> <b>current</b> velocity. These changes reflect a switch in deep North Atlantic convection to shallower depths during glacial periods, possibly {{in a manner similar}} to the increasing contribution of glacial intermediate water to the North Atlantic during the late Pleistocene glacials.

40|$|Deep-water {{sediment}} waves can {{be classified}} {{using a combination of}} grain size and wave-forming process, although in some cases one or other of these criteria may be indeterminable. Sediment waves are generated beneath currents flowing across the seabed, in the form of either downslope-flowing turbidity currents or alongslope-flowing bottom currents. Waves formed by either process show varying characteristics, depending on whether they are constructed of coarse- or fine-grained sediments. Sediment wave studies over the last five decades are reviewed, and clear trends can be discerned. Early descriptive studies in the 1950 s and 1960 s relied almost exclusively on seismic reflection profiles, and the wave-forming process was often a subject of much debate. In the 1970 s and 1980 s the quality of sediment wave datasets increased, with sidescan sonar, deep-sea drilling and numerical modelling all applied to sediment wave studies. Consequently, the wave-forming process became more easily identifiable, and models for the growth of <b>bottom</b> <b>current</b> and turbidity current sediment waves were introduced. Most studies from the 1990 s onwards have focussed on turbidity current sediment waves, in response to the increasing demand for data from turbidite systems from the hydrocarbon exploration and production industry. Studies of <b>bottom</b> <b>current</b> sediment waves during this period have focussed on the applications to palaeoceanography, in response to the recent boom in climate change studies. The main focus of this paper is the characterisation of both fine- and coarse-grained, turbidity and <b>bottom</b> <b>current</b> sediment waves, including the depositional environment, wave morphology, wave sediments and migration, and the wave-forming process. In addition, criteria for distinguishing between fine-grained <b>bottom</b> <b>current</b> and turbidity current waves are discussed, and also for identifying other wave-like features formed by different processes, such as creep folds. Although in many sediment wave studies the dominant wave-forming process is easy to determine, in others it is likely that a more complex combination of processes has occurred. Further studies should concentrate on methods for identifying these processes and how they interact, and also investigate the exact mechanisms for the initiation and evolution of sediment wave fields...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{laminated}} sediments in dysoxic {{areas of}} the ocean floor are an excellent archive for high-resolution climate reconstructions. While the existence of discontinuities produced by natural events, such as underwater landslides (slumps), strong <b>bottom</b> <b>currents,</b> and/or bioturbation is usually acknowledged for long records, {{the extent of their}} influence on high-resolution sequences is usually not considered. In the present work we show strong evidence for multiple stratigraphic discontinuities in different gravity and box-cores retrieved off Pisco (Peru) covering the last 600 years. Chronostratigraphies are largely based on cross-correlation of distinct sedimentary structures (determined by X-ray image analysis) and validated using Pb- 210, Am- 241, and C- 14 profiles, as well as proxy records. The cross-correlation of distinct stratigraphic layers allows for chronostratigraphic tie points and clearly shows that some sedimentary sequences are continuous across scales of tens of kilometers, indicating that regional processes often determine laminae formation. Some differences in laminae thickness were found among cores, which could be explained by different sedimentation rates, spatially variable deposition of diatom blooms, changes in silica dissolution and partial deposition/erosion caused by <b>bottom</b> <b>currents.</b> Using multiple stratigraphic tie points provides clear evidence for laminated sequences present in some cores to be missing in other cores. Moreover, instantaneous depositions from upslope were identified in all the cores disrupting the continuity of the sediment records. These discontinuities (instantaneous deposits and missing sequences) may be due to slumps, possibly triggered by earthquakes and/or erosion by strong <b>bottom</b> <b>currents.</b> In spite of the missing sequences in some cores, a continuous composite record of the last six centuries was reconstructed from spliced sequences of the different cores, which provides a well-constrained temporal framework to develop further high-resolution proxies in this region. The present work shows that paleoreconstructions developed from single cores, particularly in areas with strong seismic activity and/or strong <b>bottom</b> <b>currents,</b> are subject to both temporal gaps and instantaneous depositions from upslope, both of which could be misinterpreted as abrupt climate changes or anomalous climate events.

40|$|Various {{investigations}} {{carried out}} within {{the course of}} the EC FP 5 GEOMOUND and ECOMOUND projects highlighted the presence of deep-water coral banks with remarkable faunal habitats on the NE Atlantic slopes off the British Isles. The possible factors controlling the genesis, development and daily sustainment of these mounds are known, but there still is much debate concerning their genesis. The Belgica mound province on the eastern slope of the Porcupine Seabight features large surface mounds in a very complex hydrodynamic environment controlled by tidally influenced enhanced <b>bottom</b> <b>currents.</b> In this paper, we will discuss the role <b>bottom</b> <b>currents</b> have exerted on the genesis and development of the deep-water coral banks since the Neogene. Very high-resolution single channel sparker seismic profiling within this area revealed that the Cenozoic evolution of this area has known several periods of active seabed erosion. A detailed stratigraphic and sediment dynamic study demonstrated that already the position of these mounds was influenced by these erosion events. Since the onset of the present-day ocean circulation system, the sedimentation in this area was influenced by strong <b>bottom</b> <b>currents,</b> as demonstrated by the wide variety of (probably Miocene) buried sediment waves. Within the Pliocene and {{at the start of the}} Quaternary, an oceanographic very instable period was responsible for episodic widespread erosion on this margin. This resulted in an early Quaternary seabed with several levels of scarps, ridges and channels. The most elevated features, most of the time located in the vicinity of the buried sediment waves, are now the seat of the coral banks. Moreover, the coral banks are embedded in a probable Quaternary sequence of (several) contourite drifts. The seismic reflection patterns of these drift bodies also suggest most of the mounds already had evolved to an 'adult' phase before the drift sediments were deposited. In this way, the position of the mounds and the already complex early Quaternary seabed morphology formed a suitable place for local current enhancement due to topographic steering, creating small contourite drifts. Core data on these drifts suggest the strength of these <b>bottom</b> <b>currents</b> varied through the Quaternary and could have influenced the growth of the coral banks during glacial episodes...|$|R
