5|$|For the {{original}} professional tournament in the 1970s, the English entrants were either First Division or Second Division sides. (The First Division sides had generally {{finished in the}} lower half of the table, while the Second Division sides were generally mid-table or <b>better.)</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> exception of Bari and Como in 1973, all Italian teams playing in the 1970s tournament had just competed in the previous Serie A season. The Italian clubs were often mid-table or higher finishers who had sometimes also qualified for the European competitions.|$|E

5|$|In late 2009, Polytron {{presented}} an iPhone game called Power Pill at Pecha Kucha Montreal. The game features a panacean pill that travels through human bodies as its playable protagonist, and {{it uses the}} iPhone's multi-touch screen. GameSetWatch Eric Caoili compared it to Soul Bubbles and Irritating Stick. The game was developed with Alec Holowka of Infinite Ammo, and a level editor {{was expected to be}} included. While working on Fez, Fish revived a game project called SuperHyperCube, which was based on Wiimote motion capture input and stereoscopic navigation. Fish felt the game would work <b>better</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new Kinect motion tracking. The adapted game was a finalist at Indiecade 2011.|$|E
5|$|Systematic botany {{is part of}} {{systematic}} biology, which {{is concerned with the}} range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history. It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align <b>better</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Darwinian principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the International Botanical Congress.|$|E

5|$|The First Nations in {{the north}} {{typically}} had some prior experience of Europeans, for example through contact with the Hudson's Bay Company, and there was little conflict between the police and these native communities, and few crimes committed. The First Nations typically {{did not like the}} police, however, and often blamed them for wider government policies; for their part, the mounted police often regarded the First Nations with contempt. By comparison, the mounted police got on much <b>better</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Inuit, who had seen far less contact with Europeans. The force generally took a more liberal, paternalistic attitude towards them, often applying informal justice rather than official laws when the occasional Inuit crime was committed. Members of the First Nations and Inuit were employed to drive police dog sleds and cook for their patrols.|$|E
5|$|The fair {{planners}} {{also sought}} two other properties near {{the southwest corner}} of the grounds. They failed completely to make any inroads with the Seattle Archdiocese of the Roman Catholic Church, who had recently built Sacred Heart Church there; they did a bit <b>better</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Freemasons' Nile Temple, which they were able to use {{for the duration of the}} fair and which then returned to its previous use. It served as the site of the Century 21 Club. This membership organization, formed especially for the fair, charged $250 for membership and offered lounge, dining room, and other club facilities, as well as a gate pass for the duration of the fair. The city ended up leasing the property after the fair and in 1977 bought it from the Masons. The building was eventually incorporated into a theater complex including the Seattle Children's Theatre.|$|E
5|$|The {{finale of}} the A major Sonata, uses as its main theme, a {{transformation}} of an earlier theme from the second movement of the Piano Sonata in A minor, D. 537. Schubert introduced some changes to the original melody, which make it conform <b>better</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sonata's basic motifs, {{in accordance with the}} cyclical scheme of the sonata. Another allusion to an earlier piano work appears {{in the middle of the}} sonata's slow movement: after the climax in the middle section of the Andantino, appears a passage (bars 147–158) that closely recalls bars 35–39 from the Impromptu in G-flat major, D. 899.|$|E

5|$|The {{planetary}} {{exploration of}} the original Mass Effect was completely revamped. Instead of having large barren landscapes, the designers opted to build distinct and interesting places. The goal was to encourage players to keep exploring the galaxy by changing their expectations about what they could find. Originally, developers experimented {{with the idea of}} having a vehicle that could be used to navigate the planetary terrain in a more flexible way than in the original title. However, the vehicle was ultimately removed from the final build of the game. The context-sensitive interrupt system, which was originally meant to be a feature in the original Mass Effect, was introduced in Mass Effect 2 to help blend the dialogue <b>better</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rest of the action.|$|E
5|$|Wulfred (died 24 March 832) was an Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury {{in medieval}} England. Nothing {{is known of}} his life prior to 803, when he {{attended}} a church council, but he was probably a nobleman from Middlesex. He was elected archbishop in 805 and spent his time in office reforming the clergy of his cathedral. He also quarrelled with two consecutive Mercian kings– Coenwulf and Ceolwulf– over whether laymen or clergy should control monasteries. At one point, Wulfred travelled to Rome to consult with the papacy and was deposed from office {{for a number of}} years over the issue. After Coenwulf's death, relations were somewhat <b>better</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new king Ceolwulf, but improved much more after Ceolwulf's subsequent deposition. The dispute about control of the monasteries was not fully settled until 838, after Wulfred's death. Wulfred was the first archbishop to place his portrait on the coinage he struck.|$|E
5|$|Dylan, a 28 year-old grad student, is {{depressed}} {{because he}} {{is in love with}} his best friend, Kira, but she is dating Dylan's roommate, Mason. He has a cynical worldview and criticizes the world for its materialism, {{and at the same time}} wishes he could connect <b>better</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> people in it. When his roommate is away one night, Dylan and Kira begin a secret affair. When Dylan overhears Mason and Kira discussing how pitiful he is, Dylan decides to commit suicide. He jumps off a tall building, but survives due to unlikely events. That night, he is visited by a demon who claims he spared Dylan's life. The demon says Dylan must now murder one person for every additional month he wants to live. Dylan convinces himself this was a hallucination, but he begins to grow sick as the end of the month approaches. When the demon appears a second time, Dylan decides to track down a man who molested Dylan's friend when they were children. After shooting him, Dylan's sickness goes away. The next month, Dylan struggles to find another target he feels deserves to die. He settles on a brothel run by a Russian mob. He murders one of the men, but is violently beaten by one of the sex workers before he escapes. His unexplained injuries lead Kira to end their secret romance, although they remain friends. Dylan begins taking boxing lessons and stalking a corrupt businessman. A detective, Lily Sharpe, begins to connect the dots between Dylan's murders; the Russian mob begins to hunt for Dylan.|$|E

5|$|Sainsbury batting scores {{dipped in}} county cricket during 1879; in nine {{appearances}} for Somerset during the year, his highest score was 39. He performed <b>better</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ball, twice taking four wickets during an innings, against both Bedfordshire and the MCC. The following county season began more positively for Sainsbury, as he collected nine wickets in the match against Sussex at Lansdown's ground in Bath, claiming six wickets for 54runs {{in the second}} innings of the game. He claimed another eight wickets when Somerset travelled to Leicestershire, during which Sainsbury and Arnold Fothergill took five wickets each in Leicestershire's first innings, restricting the home side to 51runs. Somerset won the low-scoring contest by 85runs, Sainsbury having scored a valuable 28 during his side's first innings. Somerset's visit to Sussex saw Sainsbury continue his success against the county, {{this time with the}} bat rather than the ball. Sussex built on their 63 run first innings lead with a second innings total of 183, leaving Somerset the task of scoring 247 runs to win the match. Sainsbury scored his second century for Somerset, remaining 101 not out when Somerset reached the winning total. He was assisted by a half-century from Stephen Newton, and scores in the twenties by Bill Fowler and Frederick Smith. Later that month, his batting was once again instrumental in setting up a Somerset victory, when he top-scored with 87 as Somerset beat the MCC by an innings.|$|E
