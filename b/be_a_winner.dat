He was drawn to speculative investments and ultimately was embroiled in a financial scandal. In 1803, he joined other prominent citizens in organizing a lottery {{to raise funds for}} the Richmond Academy. He allegedly bought several chances for himself and, as remaining chances dwindled, resold some of them for a profit; he also was said to have positioned himself as one of four or five holders sure to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>winner.</b> He held the winning stub when his ticket was purportedly found lodged in a joint of the drawing drum.|$|E

25|$|Gee {{reported}} to the Giants' camp on April 1, 1945. He {{reported to}} camp late because the Groton high school basketball team that he was coaching had advanced to tournament play. When {{he arrived at the}} Giants' camp in Lakewood, New Jersey, Gee told reporters that the soreness in his arm was gone, and he believed he would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>winner.</b> Two weeks later, he gave up only one hit in three innings as a relief pitcher in a pre-season exhibition game. However, the soreness in his arm returned, and on June 9, 1945, Gee again announced that he was again retiring from the game. During the 1945 season, Gee appeared in only two games and pitched three innings for the Giants, allowing three earned runs for a 9.00 ERA.|$|E
25|$|ROH, {{while having}} the ROH World Championship, faced {{the issue of}} having another title with {{seemingly}} equal value, the ROH Pure Championship. Danielson and the ROH Pure Champion Nigel McGuinness had a match to unify the titles. They met at April 29 in a match fought under pure wrestling rules and McGuinness left Danielson outside the ring after a chair shot to win by countout; this was enough to retain the Pure title, but not to win Danielson's World Championship. They had another unification match in McGuinness' native England, where ROH declared there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>winner,</b> with a title changing hands by countout and disqualification and a draw forcing a restart. Danielson won the match on August 12 and retired the Pure title as its last champion. During a match with Colt Cabana on August 26, Danielson separated his shoulder, tearing two tendons in it, and he tore another tendon in his chest. Danielson returned at Glory by Honor V: Night 2, and was challenged by Kenta, a guest competitor from NOAH, due to the two company's talent exchange agreement; Danielson again retained his championship. At the last ROH's event of 2006, Final Battle, Danielson's fifteen-month title reign finally ended after he lost to Homicide at his 39th defense, and he subsequently took time off from wrestling in order to heal his shoulder.|$|E
500|$|Against that backdrop, the Browns {{finished}} the 1974 {{season with a}} 4–10 record, only the second losing season in the team's history. Phipps' woes persisted, and he shared playing time with rookie quarterback Brian Sipe, who Cleveland selected in the 13th round of the 1972 draft out of San Diego State. Modell fired Skorich after the season. [...] "You've got to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>winner</b> in this game, and I just didn't produce", Skorich said at the time. After pursuing Dolphins offensive line coach Monte Clark, Modell hired Forrest Gregg as Skorch's replacement. Gregg, an assistant coach and former Green Bay Packers offensive lineman, preached a hard-nosed, physical brand of football, learned as an offensive lineman on Green Bay's dynastic 1960s teams under Lombardi. His success as a player, however, did not immediately translate into success as a coach. The regular season began with the worst losing streak in Cleveland's history. Gregg's first win did not come until November 23 against Paul Brown's Cincinnati Bengals, and Cleveland finished with a 3–11 record.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the final}} of the 2011 U.S. Open against Samantha Stosur, Williams shouted [...] "Come on!" [...] as the Australian {{attempted}} to return a forehand Williams believed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>winner.</b> The chair umpire Eva Asderaki awarded the point to Stosur based on the USTA's deliberate hindrance rule, which states, [...] "If a player commits any act which hinders his opponent in making a stroke, then, if this is deliberate, he shall lose the point or if involuntary, the point shall be replayed." [...] As the point was 30–40 on Williams's serve, the penalty gave the break of serve to Stosur. Williams became angry with the chair umpire and made several gestures and unflattering comments toward her during the next changeover, including telling Asderaki that if she ever saw the umpire coming toward her, she should [...] "look the other way". Williams initially gained momentum in the set following the penalty, breaking back in the next game, but eventually flagged and lost the match, 2–6, 3–6. At the end of the match, she declined to offer the customary handshake to Asderaki. Williams mentioned the incident in her post-match speech as the tournament runner-up, claiming, [...] "I hit a winner, but I guess it didn't count," [...] but added, [...] "It wouldn't have mattered in the end. Sam played really well." [...] A writer for ESPN suggested that Williams could avoid being found to have violated the terms of the [...] "probation" [...] on which she was placed following her 2009 outburst, as she did not appear to have used profanity in addressing Asderaki during the match. In the end, Williams was fined $2,000 and was not barred from competing in the 2012 US Open because [...] "...Williams's conduct, while verbally abusive, [...] not {{rise to the level of}} a major offence under the Grand Slam code of conduct." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Listen, my dear sir," [...] said he, in mysteriously {{confidential}} tones--"listen {{to an old}} soldier's advice. I {{have been}} to the mistress of the house (a very charming woman, with a genius for cookery!) to impress on her the necessity of making us some particularly strong and good coffee. You must drink this coffee in order to get rid of your little amiable exaltation of spirits before you think of going home--you must, my good and gracious friend! With all that money to take home to-night, it is a sacred duty to yourself to have your wits about you. You are known to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>winner</b> to an enormous extent by several gentlemen present to-night, who, in a certain point of view, are very worthy and excellent fellows; but they are mortal men, my dear sir, and they have their amiable weaknesses. Need I say more? Ah, no, no! you understand me! Now, this is what you must do--send for a cabriolet when you feel quite well again--draw up all the windows when you get into it--and tell the driver to take you home only through the large and well-lighted thoroughfares. Do this; and you and your money will be safe. Do this; and to-morrow you will thank an old soldier for giving you a word of honest advice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Efficiency," [...] of course, is futile for {{the same}} reason that strong men, will-power and the superman are futile. That is, it is futile because it only deals with actions after they have been performed. It has no {{philosophy}} for incidents before they happen; therefore it has no power of choice. An act can only be successful or unsuccessful when it is over; if it is to begin, it must be, in the abstract, right or wrong. There is no such thing as backing a winner; for he cannot <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>winner</b> when he is backed. There is no such thing as fighting on the winning side; one fights to find out which is the winning side. If any operation has occurred, that operation was efficient. If a man is murdered, the murder was efficient. A tropical sun is as efficient in making people lazy as a Lancashire foreman bully in making them energetic. Maeterlinck is as efficient in filling a man with strange spiritual tremors as Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell are in filling a man with jam. But it all depends on what you want to be filled with. Lord Rosebery, being a modern skeptic, probably prefers the spiritual tremors. I, being an orthodox Christian, prefer the jam. But both are efficient when they have been effected; and inefficient until they are effected. A man who thinks much about success must be the drowsiest sentimentalist; for he must be always looking back. If he only likes victory he must always come late for the battle. For the man of action there is nothing but idealism.|$|E
