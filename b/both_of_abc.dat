Using a questionnaire survey, data was collected from twenty-six finance directors and/or chief financial officers in Australian universities. The perception <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> implementation in Australian universities depends on many variables including the understanding <b>of</b> <b>ABC,</b> consideration <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> as a strategic cost management system, the role <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> in reduction <b>of</b> expenses, consideration <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> as a valuable tool to enhance overhead cost allocation, and consideration <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> as an effective strategic cost management system designed to incorporate the university’s critical input, output, and process variables resulting in value creation. The result of regression analysis provides significant and positive association between the decision to implement ABC in Australian universities and <b>both</b> the treatment <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> as a strategic cost management system and the degree <b>of</b> <b>both</b> senior management and internal champion support. The findings indicate substantial differences in the allocation of the overhead costs between ABC and traditional costing systems. The result also reveals that many Australian universities using the ABC method receive benefits in improving cost reduction and better resource allocation with revenue surplus. Furthermore, the study develops a generic model of cost pools and drivers <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> implementation in Australian universities...|$|R

40|$|ABC 50 is an ATP-binding {{cassette}} (ABC) protein, which, {{unlike most}} ABC proteins, does not possess membrane-spanning domains. ABC 50 interacts with eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF 2), which {{plays a key}} role in translation initiation and its control. ABC 50 binds to ribosomes, and this interaction requires both the N-terminal domain and at least one <b>ABC</b> domain. Knockdown <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> 50 by RNA interference impaired translation <b>of</b> <b>both</b> cap-dependent and -independent reporters, consistent with a positive role for ABC 50 in the function of eIF 2, which is required for <b>both</b> types <b>of</b> translation initiation. Mutation of the Walker box A or B motifs in <b>both</b> <b>ABC</b> regions <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> 50 yielded a mutant protein that exerted a dominant-interfering phenotype with respect to protein synthesis and translation initiation. Importantly, although dominant-interfering mutants <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> 50 impaired cap-dependent translation, translation driven by certain internal ribosome entry segments was not inhibited. ABC 50 is located in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm but not in the nucleolus. Thus, ABC 50 is not likely to be directly involved in early ribosomal biogenesis, unlike some other ABC proteins. Taken together, the present data show that ABC 50 {{plays a key role}} in translation initiation and has functions that are distinct from those <b>of</b> other non-membrane <b>ABC</b> proteins.

40|$|In today’s dynamic, {{uncertain}} and highly competitive business environment, {{the long term}} success of an organization critically depends on the perceptions, choices and actions of its managers regarding their strategies. Activity based costing (ABC) and balanced scorecard (BSC) are the modern day management approaches acknowledged as reliable tools for strategy formulation and implementation in an organization. In this paper, ABC and BSC models are separately proposed and applied in the merry-go-round (MGR) department of an Indian thermal power plant. The results elicited from adoption of these two models in the said power plant provide more accurate, timely, and reliable operational and financial information at different activity levels of the organization, which would help in effective strategic and tactical decision making. Even though, there are limited published research papers related to application <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> model in power plants, none of them has adopted ABC and BSC techniques in an Indian contextual environment.

To define the {{clinical}} and radiographic features useful for diagnosis, x-rays <b>of</b> 24 <b>ABCs</b> and 21 GCTs of the foot were reviewed. Adding our series to the cases reported in the literature, the only important clinical data that emerged was {{the average age of}} patients affected by ABC and GCT (15 and 27 years, respectively). ABCs localized in small tarsal bones were rare (6 %), whereas 19 % of GCTs were found in this site. The eccentric, round shape of a lytic lesion was more characteristic of GCT. An aggressive pattern of radiographic bone destruction was observed more frequently in GCT than in ABC (P = 0. 01). Septation was seen in <b>both</b> tumors.

30|$|Note that {{we choose}} {{measuring}} the convergence rate in cycle for following reasons: Generally, computational time of calling objection function {{is much larger}} than other parts <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> algorithm, particularly when our objection function includes multiple times SVM training. The SVM training takes more than much time, and in each cycle, the code of objection function will be called many times (same times in each cycle for different algorithm, and times is determined by parameter PN). Objection function calling occupies more than 90 % computational time <b>of</b> <b>both</b> original <b>ABC</b> algorithm and modified ones (for instance, for dataset 4, about 22.3 [*]s are cost by running D-ABC algorithm for each cycle, 21.7 [*]s for MR-ABC algorithm, and 20.5 [*]s for original ABC algorithm. It is obviously that objection function cost most time in each cycle). Moreover, every time the objection function is called, the solution is modified. Therefore, it is more reasonable measuring the convergence rate in cycle than in time. On the contrary, if measuring the convergence rate in specified computational time, each solution might be modified different times, which could be unfair.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{potentiometric}} fluorescence probe diS-C 3 (3) is {{expelled from}} S. cerevisiae by ABC pumps Pdr 5 and Snq 2 and can conveniently {{be used for}} studying their performance. The activity of these pumps in a strain with wild-type PDR 1 allele was shown to drop sharply on glucose depletion from the medium and then again {{at the end of}} the diauxic shift when the cells are adapted to growth on respiratory substrates. The presence of the PDR 1 - 3 allele causing pump overproduction prevented this second drop and the pump activity typical for diauxic cells was largely retained. Growth phase-dependent changes of membrane potential measured by the same probe in pump-free mutants included a Δψ drop in the late exponential and diauxic growth phase, indicating lowered activity of H+-ATPase. Suppression <b>of</b> activity <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>ABC</b> pumps and H+-ATPase obviously signifies cell transition to an energy-saving mode. Challenging respiration-adapted cells with glucose showed a novel feature <b>of</b> yeast <b>ABC</b> pumps—a strong dependence of pump activity on the type of the carbon source...|$|R
40|$|A unified {{approach}} has been proposed in the paper for processing unbalanced operating conditions in transient stability calculations. The suggested method combined advantages <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>abc</b> phase coordinates and 012 sequence coordinates. The former is used to describe faults since it is suitable to modeling simultaneous faults and the latter is used for time simulation for its sparse nature. Novel fault description and coordinate conversion formulation is presented. The equivalent positive sequence bus admittance matrix is derived for interface with generators in stability simulation. With the new method, the sequence network constitution can be avoided; multiple and simultaneous faults and element parameter unbalance can be simulated easily; and the sparse technology can still be applied for study efficiency.

40|$|In {{deciding}} {{on the treatment}} plan for patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), the burden of COPD as experienced by patients should be the core focus. It is therefore important for daily practice to develop a tool that can both assess the burden of COPD and facilitate communication with patients in clinical practice. This paper describes the development of an integrated tool to assess the burden of COPD in daily practice. A definition of the burden of COPD was formulated by a Dutch expert team. Interviews showed that patients and health-care providers agreed on this definition. We found no existing instruments that fully measured burden of disease according to this definition. However, the Clinical COPD Questionnaire meets most requirements, and was therefore used and adapted. The adapted questionnaire is called the Assessment of Burden <b>of</b> COPD (<b>ABC)</b> scale.
