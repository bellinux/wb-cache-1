40|$|Abstract—A {{platform}} to study ultrasound {{as a source}} for wireless energy transfer and communication for implanted medical devices is described. A tank is used as a container for a pair of electroacoustic transducers, where a control unit is fixed to one wall of the tank and a transponder can be manually moved in three axes and rotate using a mechanical system. The tank is filled with water to allow acoustic energy and data transfer, and the system is optimized to avoid parasitic effects due to cables, reflection paths and cross talk problems. A printed circuit board is developed to test energy scavenging such that enough acoustic intensity is generated by the control unit to recharge a <b>battery</b> <b>loaded</b> to the transponder. In the same manner, a second printed circuit board is fabricated to study transmission of information through acoustic waves.

40|$|As {{electric}} vehicles (EVs) {{become more and}} more popular, there also has to exist an appropriate infrastructure of <b>battery</b> <b>loading</b> stations to allow for a widespread usage. Especially long distance routes are still not covered, due to the short cruising range of EVs. In this thesis we develop an algorithm for placing such stations so that every shortest path can be driven without running out of energy, assuming an adjustable initial and maximum battery charge. Considering an initial roll-out of <b>battery</b> <b>loading</b> stations, we aim at placing as few as possible, while still meeting the above constraint. Therefore, we rely on a theoretical hitting set formulation of the problem to be able to precisely analyze and evaluate it, followed by a - at first - naive algorithm which is then improved {{in the course of the}} thesis. A dual problem is introduced to allow a computation of instance-based bounds. Finally we evaluate our implementation practically in regard to memory usage, runtime and quality of the results and furthermore theoretically prove general upper bounds. The final algorithm is capable of computing a <b>battery</b> <b>loading</b> station positioning on the graph of Germany in less than one day on our testing machine, with evidentially good quality...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{a battery}} powered system, a primary design {{consideration}} is the battery lifetime. Profile of current {{drawn from a}} battery determines its lifetime. Recently in [4] dynamic voltage scaling {{has been applied to}} alter the <b>battery</b> <b>load</b> current profile in distributed systems to reduce <b>battery</b> charge consumption. <b>Load</b> current profile is changed by utilizing the slack in the execution of the scheduled tasks. In this paper we propose a new dynamic voltage scaling procedure that alters load current profile by considering the total battery current instead of the method of [4] that considers the current dawn by individual task with the latest finish times in the schedule. The task schedule is partitioned into steps defined in this work and the load currents during selected steps are targeted for reduction by scaling the supply voltage of the processing elements. Experimental results on a large set of task graphs show that battery charge consumption reductions of up to 89. 80 % are achieved by the new algorithm. I...|$|R
