40|$|This study {{presents}} a high-gain <b>bow-tie</b> <b>antenna</b> for applications in next generation base-stations operating from 2. 5 to 3. 9 GHz. The proposed structure {{consists of three}} circular sector patches that are attached laterally to the microstrip feed-line, which is etched {{on both sides of}} the common dielectric substrate to create symmetrical <b>bow-tie</b> <b>antenna.</b> By loading the antenna with a 2 × 5 array of enhanced end-coupled split-ring (EECSR) unit-cells results in significant enhancement in the antenna gain performance. This is because the EECSR unit-cells behave as parasitic radiators, which is analogous to Yagi–Uda antennas. The EECSR unit-cells provide a medium of high effective permittivity that effectively reduces the spacing between parasitic directors. As a consequence, a compact and miniature structure is achieved compared with conventional quasi-Yagi–Uda planar designs. The dimension of EECSR unit-cell is 33 × 36 mm 2 with inter-element spacing of 0. 075 λ 0 at 3. 5 GHz. A prototype of the antenna was fabricated and its performance was measured to validate the simulation results.
