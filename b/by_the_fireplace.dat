25|$|In central Serbia, {{once the}} {{household}} members {{have gone to}} bed, an elderly woman of the family sticks a knife into the house door from the inside. Alternatively, she puts a hawthorn stake by the door, hanging a wreath of garlic on it. This is done as a protection against curses, witches, and demons. For the same reason, children are rubbed with garlic on the palms, armpits, and soles before going to bed. In some regions, the men keep watch in shifts <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> during the night, to keep the fire burning.|$|E
25|$|Babe strikes up a {{friendship}} with Bianca Montgomery during December 2003. They grow close and become best friends. At a cabin, while a storm goes on outside, Babe helps Bianca give birth to her baby daughter, Miranda Montgomery. Bianca falls unconscious and Babe leaves to go get help. She breaks into Dr. David Hayward's cabin and calls Paul at Llanview Hospital for help. The day before (on One Life to Live), Paul helped his sister, Kelly, {{give birth to a}} baby boy, but the baby died right after birth. Kelly, believing a baby would be {{the only thing that could}} save her marriage, begged her brother to get her a child. Paul helps Babe get back to the cabin, where he delivers her son <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b>|$|E
25|$|Having said that, {{he moves}} the log a little forward and throws a coin into the fire. The {{woman of the}} house puts a woolen blanket on the polazniks back, and seats him on a low stool <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b> In {{the moment when he}} sits down, they try to pull away the stool beneath him, as if to make him fall on the floor. The polaznik goes out into the yard, and throws grain inside a circle made with the rope with which Christmas straw has been tied, calling chickens. When they gather in the circle he catches a rooster, whose head is then cut off by him or the head of {{household}} on the house's threshold. The rooster will be roasted on a wooden spit as part of Christmas dinner. The polaznik usually stays for dinner with the family. He receives a gift {{in the form of a}} round cake with an embedded coin, and a towel, shirt, socks, or some other useful thing.|$|E

500|$|The Oak Bedroom is at {{the rear}} of the house, on the western side between King William Bedroom and the Great Room. The {{marriage}} of the first Earl Spencer and Margaret Georgiana took place in secret here on 20 December 1755, during a ball which was taking place at Althorp to celebrate John's 21st birthday. Georgiana later recalled, [...] "We both behaved very well, spoke distinctly and loudly but I trembled so much I could hardly stand". As of 1998 it was furnished with deep red wall paper, rug and chairs, with oak floors, bed and chairs. There are several portraits on the wall, one of them very large above the fireplace. The Spencer [...] "S" [...] features on the blue velvet bed cover, and above the king-sized bed and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b>|$|E
500|$|Mercer soon married wealthy socialite Winthrop Rutherfurd (1862–1944), {{a widower}} then in his fifties, but despite her {{marriage}} and Franklin's promise, the two remained in surreptitious, albeit infrequent contact {{in the three}} decades that followed. Especially during the War years, Franklin's daughter Anna Roosevelt Halsted arranged for her father to meet with his former mistress, more frequently after Rutherfurd's death in 1944. [...] Mercer was in Warm Springs, Georgia, at the [...] "Little White House" [...] the President's long-time cottage and retreat, {{at the time of}} Roosevelt's death in April 1945. He was having his portrait painted, at Mercer's request, by the artist Elizabeth Shoumatoff in the living room – with Mercer and two female cousins attending. While sitting at a card table <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace,</b> reading an upcoming speech, Roosevelt said, [...] "I have a terrific pain {{in the back of my}} head." [...] He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious. [...] Madame Shoumatoff, who maintained close friendships with both Roosevelt and Mercer, rushed Mercer away to avoid negative publicity and implications of infidelity. [...] Mercer's presence in the house was not mentioned in the immediate press reports nor in any of the early published biographies.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 August, Commander John Willoughby Marshall and Lynx, in {{the company}} of the gun-brig Monkey under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Fitzgerald, {{discovered}} three Danish luggers off the Danish coast. [...] The water was too shallow for Lynx, so Marshall sent Monkey and boats from Lynx in to cut them out. [...] The largest of the luggers, which had four guns and four howitzers, opened fire on Monkey before all three luggers ran ashore once Monkey and the launch's 18-pounder carronade returned fire. The British refloated the luggers and brought them out the next day, having taken no casualties. [...] In their haste to quit the vessel, the Danes failed to fire the fuse on a cask of gunpowder they had left <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> on the largest lugger. Marshall thought the Danes' behaviour in leaving the explosive device disgraceful. The largest lugger was Captain Japen (or Captain Jassen). She had had a crew of 45 men, who had fled, and during the engagement she had thrown two of her howitzers overboard. The second lugger, name unknown, had four guns and a crew of 20. The third lugger was Speculation, of three guns and 19 men. Her crew too had thrown two guns overboard. At the end of the month, on 27 August, Lynx captured a Danish sloop that also bore the name Speculation.|$|E

2500|$|That night, Louis Martin and his daughters, Léonie, Céline and Thérèse, {{attended}} the midnight mass at the cathedral in Lisieux— [...] "but {{there was very}} little heart left in them. On 1 December, Léonie, covered in eczema and hiding her hair under a short mantilla, had returned to Les Buissonnets after just seven weeks of the Poor Clares regime in Alençon", and her sisters were helping her get over her sense of failure and humiliation. Back at Les Buissonnets as every year, Thérèse [...] "as was the custom for French children, had left her shoes on the hearth, empty in anticipation of gifts, not from Father Christmas but from the Child Jesus, who was imagined to travel through the air bearing toys and cakes." [...] While she and Celine were going up the stairs she heard her father, [...] "perhaps exhausted by the hour, or this reminder of the relentless emotional demands of his weepy youngest daughter", say with some irritation [...] "Therese is far too old for this now. Fortunately this will be the last year!" [...] Thérèse had begun to cry and Céline advised her not to go back downstairs immediately. Then, suddenly, Thérèse pulled herself together and wiped her tears. She ran down the stairs, knelt <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> and unwrapped her surprises as jubilantly as ever. In her account, nine years later, of 1895 : [...] "In an instant Jesus, content with my good will, accomplished the work I {{had not been able to}} do in ten years." [...] After nine sad years she had [...] "recovered the strength of soul she had lost" [...] when her mother died and, she said, [...] "she was to retain it forever". She discovered the joy in self-forgetfulness and added, [...] "I felt, in a word, charity enter my heart, the need to forget myself to make others happy—Since this blessed night I was not defeated in any battle, but instead I went from victory to victory and began, so to speak, [...] "to run a giant's course" [...] (Psalms [...] ).|$|E

5000|$|Cooking in an 1823 {{house would}} have {{involved}} using <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> and in <b>the</b> {{case of the}} Schencks a 10 plate stove and pipe. A [...] "5 plate stove" [...] or German Jamb stove was a cast-iron free-standing stove developed in German speaking regions in the 1550s A.D.. However, it was used for heating the sleeping and sitting areas of {{the first floor of}} the house. The kitchen was heated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>fireplace.</b> Once in America German immigrants developed a 6 plate Six Plate stove (history) or closed stove which was cooked on <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 1740s.
