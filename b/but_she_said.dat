5|$|In late 1986, {{questions}} were asked in the UK Parliament concerning the matters in Lobster. Then Labour Party Member of Parliament for Hull North, Kevin McNamara, brought up {{the issue in the}} House of Commons, asking the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, to refer the matter to the Security Commission, and asking then Attorney-General and Conservative MP Michael Havers, to ask the Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate allegations published in Lobster and prosecute Colin Wallace for revealing details of secret service operations against Her Majesty's Government. Both declined. Two weeks later, Labour MP Tam Dalyell asked the Prime Minister why she would not refer the matter to the Security Commission, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that she had nothing more to add.|$|E

25|$|Soon after, Lim {{returned}} to Kuala Lumpur in July 1966, under his family members' accompaniment. In Malaysia, Lim was alleged for having an extramarital affair with Nelson the stripper, but Lim denied. Nelson also {{spoke to the}} reporters in Australia; she stressed that she and Lim were just ordinary friends {{and that she was}} totally unaware of his whereabouts during his disappearance. Malaysian Parliament opposition members even invited her to Malaysia to answer queries about her relationship with Lim, which she declined; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that she could send a pile of photographs of her to them if they wanted.|$|E
25|$|Competing {{at home in}} the Pan American Weightlifting Championships {{and after}} {{spending}} 24 hours without food to reach her category weight limit, 58kg, she won the gold medal in snatch setting a new Pan American record with 97kg and gold in total with 207kg. She won the clean and jerk silver with 110kg after losing by bodyweight to the Colombian Rusmeris Villar with the same lift. Her coach confessed that she made the same mistake with her arms in her two fails with 113 trying to set a new record. Contreras felt disappointed with herself because she was in great form for the competition, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that always prepares herself physically and under God's willing.|$|E

25|$|In North Carolina, {{there had}} been rumors that Senator Elizabeth Dole would retire from the Senate and run for governor, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> in 2006 that she {{intended}} to run for re-election. There was early speculation that North Carolina Governor Mike Easley might be pressured into running against her but this {{did not come to}} pass. The Democratic nominee was state Senator Kay Hagan, who defeated Jim Neal and Dustin Lassiter in the Democratic primary. A Rasmussen poll released May 11, 2008 showed Hagan leading Dole by a statistically insignificant margin, 48% - 47%, suggesting a competitive race. Hagan's poll numbers continued to best Dole's, however, and Hagan defeated Dole by a wider than expected margin of 53% to 44%.|$|E
25|$|Wenceslao Retana, a {{political}} commentator in Spain, had slighted Rizal by writing an insulting article in La Epoca, {{a newspaper in}} Madrid. He implied that the family and friends of Rizal were evicted from their lands in Calamba for not having paid their due rents. The incident (when Rizal was ten) stemmed from an accusation that Rizal's mother, Teodora, tried to poison {{the wife of a}} cousin, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> she was trying to help. With the approval of the Church prelates, and without a hearing, she was ordered to prison in Santa Cruz in 1871. She was made to walk the ten miles (16km) from Calamba. She was released after two-and-a-half years of appeals to the highest court. In 1887, Rizal wrote a petition on behalf of the tenants of Calamba, and later that year led them to speak out against the friars' attempts to raise rent. They initiated a litigation which resulted in the Dominicans' evicting them from their homes, including the Rizal family. General Valeriano Weyler had the buildings on the farm torn down.|$|E
25|$|But on October 30, 2009, Justice Kornreich {{declined}} {{to approve a}} renew and re-argue of her July29 decision holding that SNG could change its club rules, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that the decision only dealt with Rules 49–54, and that everything else about rules changes was dicta (meaning {{that it was just}} discussion—not essential to the decision about Rules 49–54 and can not be used as precedent). Further, the court ordered the nomination of a panel of three independent experts who had sat on an America's Cup jury in the past in order to resolve certain outstanding issues. On the basis of the unanimous opinion of those three experts, on November19, 2009, judge Kornreich ruled that: (1) all ballast, whether moveable or not, must be included when measuring the Load Water Line; (2) it would be safe to hold the race in Valencia in February, (3) the Notice of Race and other rules could be issued as little as 16 days before the race, but the matter is moot because SNG had already published the Notice of Race; that Notice of Race could be modified by SNG but any modifications could be challenged by GGYC and would be reviewed by the jury; (4) the question of when the panel of jurors is customarily appointed is moot because the jury would soon be named; (5) the arrangements between ISAF and SNG regarding appointment of the jury appeared acceptable.|$|E

500|$|Solanas {{may have}} {{intended}} {{to write an}} eponymous autobiography. In a 1977 Village Voice interview, she announced a book with her name as the title. The book, possibly intended as a parody, was supposed {{to deal with the}} [...] "conspiracy" [...] which led to her imprisonment. In a corrective 1977 Village Voice interview, Solanas said the book would not be autobiographical other than a small portion {{and that it would be}} about many things, include proof of statements in the manifesto, and would [...] "deal very intensively with the subject of bullshit", <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> nothing about parody.|$|E

500|$|Kat Dennings plays Norah Silverberg, {{the teenage}} {{daughter}} of a wealthy record producer who shares Nick's passion for music. Dennings was the second actor to be cast (Cera having been first), Sollett saying that [...] "her being liberated from [...] liberated the film in many ways, and certainly her character from cliché." [...] Dennings felt that she related to Norah {{more than any other}} she had played before and [...] "wanted to make sure she was really fleshed out". Her favorite day of shooting was with a group of drag queens at a gay cabaret, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that filming Norah's first orgasm was [...] "really uncomfortable...

500|$|Los Angeles Times writer Gerrick Kennedy said {{he liked}} the Robin character's charm and {{chemistry}} with Katherine, and said their story arc [...] "has already grown infinitely {{more interesting than the}} Angie Bolen mystery". He said the relationship made more sense for Katherine than her previous subplots involving her romance with Mike and her mental breakdown following their break-up. Isabelle Carreau of TV Squad said she was glad the episode was centered on the supporting cast, particularly praising the attention to Bob and Lee, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that did not like the direction the Andrew character had taken, and felt the relationship between Katherine and Robin had evolved too fast.|$|E
500|$|According to author Clayborne Carson, Till's {{death and}} the {{widespread}} coverage of the students integrating Little Rock Central High School in 1957 were especially profound for younger blacks: [...] "It was out of this festering discontent and an awareness of earlier isolated protests that the sit-ins of the 1960s were born." [...] After seeing pictures of Till's mutilated body, in Louisville, Kentucky, young Cassius Clay (later famed boxer Muhammad Ali) and a friend took out their frustration by vandalizing a local railyard, causing a locomotive engine to derail. It is speculated that Till's story influenced Harper Lee to create the character Tom Robinson in her novel To Kill A Mockingbird, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> the plot was related to a much earlier incident in her life.|$|E

500|$|Brown {{said that}} the most common {{complaint}} that he received about JC's Girls was [...] "the way Heather Veitch looks... her breasts are too big and she looks too much like a stripper", a complaint to which he responded that [...] "God can use any individual to change the world". Veitch said in 2008 that Christians commonly say that JC's Girls dress like sex workers, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that the look is intended to help women in the sex industry identify with the group. Annie Lobert of Hookers for Jesus, a similar group that collaborates with JC's Girls, said {{around the same time}} that Christians make the same kind of comments about her and her ministry—"They say my T-shirt is too tight", said Lobert, [...] "but, hey, when in Vegas, do as Vegas does".|$|E
500|$|When John Singer Sargent's {{portrait}} {{of her was}} presented by her fellow-workers in 1898, Hill made a speech in which she said, [...] "When I am gone, I hope my friends will not try to carry out any special system, or to follow blindly in the track which I have trodden. New circumstances require various efforts, {{and it is the}} spirit, not the dead form, that should be perpetuated. ... We shall leave them a few houses, purified and improved, a few new and better ones built, a certain amount of thoughtful and loving management, a few open spaces..." [...] <b>But,</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> more important would be [...] "the quick eye to see, the true soul to measure, the large hope to grasp the mighty issues of the new and better days to come [...] – greater ideals, greater hope, and patience to realize both." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{different}} {{rhythm and}} tempo {{occurs in the}} middle where it main composition has rock influences and piano, as Banderas uttered the line, [...] "She didn't say much, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> it loud". The choir is brought back towards the end, followed by an orchestral passage consisting of the main theme, accompanied by sounds of gong and timpani. Madonna sings the final verses, uttering the lines [...] "share my glory, so share my coffin". Author J. Randy Taraborrelli complemented Madonna's singing in the book, , describing her vocals as [...] "supple and strong". This view was shared by author Lucy O'Brien in [...] who said that [...] "the sweetness {{and the power of}} Madonna's voice comes out as never before on these tracks". It also received positive review from Paul Verna of Billboard, who listed the [...] "flamenco flavored" [...] song as a highlight from the soundtrack.|$|E
