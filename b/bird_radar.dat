40|$|<b>Bird</b> {{identification}} with <b>radar</b> {{is important for}} bird migration research, environmental impact assessments (e. g. wind farms), aircraft security and radar meteorology. In a study on <b>bird</b> migration, <b>radar</b> signals from <b>birds,</b> insects and ground clutter were recorded. Signals from birds show a typical pattern due to wing flapping. The data were labelled by experts into the four classes BIRD, INSECT, CLUTTER and UFO (unidentifiable signals). We present a classification algorithm aimed at automatic recognition of bird targets. Variables related to signal intensity and wing flapping pattern were extracted (via continuous wavelet transform). We used support vector classifiers to build predictive models. We estimated classification performance via cross validation on four datasets. When data from the same dataset were used for training and testing the classifier, the classification performance was extremely to moderately high. When data from one dataset were used for training and the three remaining datasets were used as test sets, the performance was lower but still extremely to moderately high. This shows that the method generalizes well across different locations or times. Our method provides a substantial gain of time when birds must be identified in large collections of radar signals and it represents the first substantial step in developing a real time <b>bird</b> identification <b>radar</b> system. We provide some guidelines and ideas for future research...|$|R

40|$|Although radar {{has been}} used in studies of bird {{migration}} for 60 years, there is still no network in Europe for comprehensive monitoring of bird migration. Europe has a dense network of military air surveillance radars but most systems are not directly suitable for reliable bird monitoring. Since the early 1990 s, Doppler radars and wind profilers have been introduced in meteorology to measure wind. These wind measurements are known to be contaminated with insect and bird echoes. The aim of the present research is to assess how bird migration information can be deduced from meteorological Doppler radar output. We compare the observations on migrating birds using a dedicated X-band <b>bird</b> <b>radar</b> with those using a C-band Doppler weather radar. The observations were collected in the Netherlands, from 1 March to 22 May 2003. In this period, the <b>bird</b> <b>radar</b> showed that densities of more than one bird per km 3 are present in 20 % of all measurements. Among these measurements, the weather radar correctly recognized 86 % of the cases when birds were present; in 38 % of the cases with no birds detected by the <b>bird</b> <b>radar,</b> the weather radar claimed bird presenc...|$|E

40|$|A fully {{automated}} method {{for the detection}} and quantification of bird migration was developed for operational C-band weather radar, measuring bird density, speed and direction {{as a function of}} altitude. These weather radar bird observations have been validated with data from a high-accuracy dedicated <b>bird</b> <b>radar,</b> which was stationed in the measurement volume of weather radar sites in The Netherlands, Belgium and France for a full migration season during autumn 2007 and spring 2008. We show that weather radar can extract near real-time bird density altitude profiles that closely correspond to the density profiles measured by dedicated <b>bird</b> <b>radar.</b> Doppler weather radar can thus be used as a reliable sensor for quantifying bird densities aloft in an operational setting, which—when extended to multiple radars—enables the mapping and continuous monitoring of bird migration flyways. By applying the automated method to a network of weather radars, we observed how mesoscale variability in weather conditions structured the timing and altitude profile of bird migration within single nights. Bird density altitude profiles were observed that consisted of multiple layers, which could be explained from the distinct wind conditions at different take-off sites. Consistently lower bird densities are recorded in The Netherlands compared with sites in France and eastern Belgium, which reveals some of the spatial extent of the dominant Scandinavian flyway over continental Europe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Radar {{ornithology}} {{using data}} from the NEXRAD weather radar system has given scientists new tools for studying bird migration in the United States. Unfortunately, the process of identifying echoes from <b>birds</b> in <b>radar</b> data still largely requires that trained technicians spend hours manually scouring radar scans. This paper provides some background for understanding biological echoes in NEXRAD data and then describes our initial investigations of the use of machine learning techniques to help automate the process of echo classification. Doppler data allows researchers to look at bird migration by examining large clusters of birds that could be observed approaching and descending at stopover points where they would rest until they began the next leg of their journey. One of the NEXRAD system’s greatest strengths has also been a significant obstacle for researchers studying bird migration: with 154 radar stations across the United States, each often producing hundreds of volume scans per day, the amount of data to sort through is staggering. The real problem is that classifying <b>birds</b> in <b>radar</b> scans currently requires a skilled technician who has been trained in visually identifying the tell-tale signs that distinguish biological echoes from non-biological echoes. Consequently, the task o...|$|R

40|$|Dedicated <b>bird</b> <b>radars</b> {{have been}} used in ornithological studies for many years. This {{techniques}} has the advantage that it provides continuous data on a large scale. However, there are also several restrictions to this technique: the recorded radar data have a low taxonomic resolution and radars also records objects other than birds (e. g. sea surface, ships, rain). All unwanted detections are being referred to as clutter. The goal {{of this study is to}} develop a reliable filter, based on the differences in target characteristics as recorded by the radar, to post-process the vertical radar data which removes as much clutter from the database as possible. This will result in a more accurate bird flux and therefore an improved outcome of the bird collision model. The model tests showed very high scores for the criteria accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The model precision is a lower in one of the two tests. This is caused by a relatively high number of false positives in the model results. This will be improved in the future by including variables in the decision tree analysis which are linked to the bird track level, instead of only using the variables recorded by the radar which describe the single targets, as was the case in the current model...|$|R
40|$|Bird counts, {{the basis}} of bird {{avoidance}} programs, provide excellent and detailed information about bird species, population sizes and their behaviour on and around airports. But, visual observation of birds is limited by astronomical and meteorological conditions, altitudes and distances and by their monitoring frequency. In order to additionally obtain continuous and area covering information on bird activity in the closer vicinity of airports, the German Board of Bird Strike Prevention (DAVVL e. V.) started a program of <b>bird</b> <b>radar</b> detection at major airports in co-operation with the German Air Traffic Control Organisation (DFS GmbH), using {{a new generation of}} Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR- 2000). Within a distance of 10 nm around the local radar sensor, echoes of moving targets have been video recorded and computer stored in quarter-hourly intervals. Bird migration in regional scale and bird activity on a local scale could be detected, which gives interesting insights into the daily and seasonal activity pattern of birds around the airports. The objective of the program, method and results as well as examples of the recordings will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Wind {{profiles}} from {{an operational}} C-band Doppler radar have been combined {{with data from}} a bird tracking radar to assess the wind profile quality during bird migration. The weather radar wind profiles (WRWPs) are retrieved using the well-known volume velocity processing (VVP) technique. The X-band <b>bird</b> <b>radar</b> performed range–height scans perpendicular to the main migration direction and bird densities were deduced by counting and normalizing the observed echoes. It is found that the radial velocity standard deviation (� r) obtained from the VVP retrieval is a skillful indicator of bird migration. Using a threshold of 2 ms � 1 on � r, more than 93 % of the bird-contaminated wind vectors are rejected while over 70 % of the true wind vectors are accepted correctly. For high bird migration densities the raw weather radar wind vectors have a positive speed bias of 8. 6 � 3. 8 m s � 1, while the quality-controlled wind vectors have a negligible speed bias. From the performance statistics against a limited area numerical weather prediction model, it is concluded that all (significant) bird contamination is removed and that high-quality weathe...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} five years, {{development}} of mobile bird detection radars for use as real-time aircraft bird strike avoidance systems has moved from research and development into active deployment as an operational technology. The MERLIN™ bird detection radar, with an update rate as frequent as once per second, is currently deployed as production-model technology with 15 systems operating in the U. S., Canada, Scotland, England and The Netherlands. Deployment challenges {{over the past two}} years have included “how” and “in what forms” to deliver the real-time and near real-time information to controllers, wildlife control units, pilots and decision makers so that bird hazards can be more reliably detected, strike risk reduced, bird control efficiency increased, and to develop detailed historical resource databases to support long-term management actions. MERLIN systems are currently being used in civil, military and landfill environments using widearea wireless distribution of data displays and products in real-time direct to airfield operations, planners and bird control units.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{will discuss}} three information technologies currently available for management of aircraft birdstrike risk: The United States Air Force (USAF) Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS), the USAF United States Bird Avoidance Model (US BAM), and mobile <b>bird</b> detection <b>radar</b> systems. These three technologies {{have been under}} development since the mid- 1990 ’s and efforts are now underway to exchange data and integrate the technologies. In 2005 the USAF Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Team assigned responsibility for further development and refinement of the US BAM to the contractor team responsible for the ongoing development and operation of AHAS. The intent is to further integrate the BAM and AHAS. The objective is for the BAM to become a map oriented graphical user interface (GUI) to AHAS, {{in addition to the}} historic data it has previously provided. AHAS will also make greater use of BAM data in identifying risk areas on low level routes for pilots. Small Mobile Avian Radar Systems are being used to ground truth and refine the calibration of NEXRAD (WSR- 88 D) radar data. The intent is to use this data to refine the risk surfaces contained in the BAM and used by AHAS in assessing current risk. This methodology will allow small Mobile Avian Radar Systems deployed on airfields and ranges to refine the “big picture” of bird activity presented by AHAS. As of 2005, three advanced information technologies are available to support effective management of aircraft birdstrike risk: AHAS, BAM and mobile <b>bird</b> detection <b>radar</b> systems.

40|$|For {{military}} training flights bird strikes en route {{are still a}} severe problem. To reduce collisions an international project has been launched by the European Space agency (ESA), aiming 1) for a compilation of information on current bird movements by various sensors, 2) to combine them in a single model, and to finally 3) predict bird strike risks for different spatial and temporal scales. A potential sensor to achieve these aims is the already existing European network of weather radars, but measurement accuracy has to be validated first. We compared data from three different weather radar systems with results from a specialized <b>bird</b> <b>radar</b> operating simultaneously {{within the range of}} these systems. The analysis clearly showed that weather radars are well suited for monitoring bird migration over time, and also for providing reliable height distributions of targets. Additionally, we compared these findings with the results from the long-range surveillance radar (ROBIN-system), being operational in the Netherlands and Belgium. Our results suggest that almost real-time information on bird movements can be provided by implementing a bird filter to the existing continent-wide network of weather radar systems. Apart from highly improved bird strike warnings, this network would yield invaluable information for scientific research on bird migration and the influence of the weather regime, climate change, and the dispersal of avian diseases...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} six years the Center of Excellence in Airport Technology (CEAT) has been {{supporting}} Federal Aviation Administration research in aircraft and airport safety. CEAT has conducted reviews of bird strike sensor technology, and has led validation testing of a radar developed specifically for bird detection at airports. This experience, which includes development of quality assurance plans and field validation of radar capabilities has {{led to the development of}} protocols for bird strike radar performance assessment. The protocols to be reviewed are based on a request made to <b>bird</b> <b>radar</b> vendors that asked for information in three areas: 1) A power gains and losses budget that is a flow chart of power change through the sensor system; 2) A listing of performance specifications that provides documented results of testing that provides performance specifications/ expectations for the sensor system with either wildlife targets or known or reference targets; and 3) A detailed description of data provided by the radar, including the capacity for remote operation of the system. In addition, CEAT prepared a listing of information required for a comprehensive performance assessments that included information on radar components and the characteristics of remote operation including the cyber infrastructure needed to support effective use of radar data in the airport environment, including both data and metadata.

40|$|Chronologically {{bird strike}} {{prevention}} {{has gone through}} a number of phases. In the beginning of aviation bird strikes were relatively rare and considered unavoidable. With the introduction of faster jet engines, the problem became more prominent and birds were scared away from the runway environment. It was soon recognized that these re-active, corrective measures had to be accompanied by a pro-active, preventive approach in the form of habitat management. Nowadays, bird strike prevention is part of legislation, auditing and Safety Management Systems. It is however, still characterized to a great extend by measures that counter the problem instead of containing it. The RNLAF is actively searching for ways to put more emphasis on containing the problem rather than only counter it by a one dimensional zero tolerance approach. Therefore, parallel to the meteo status, RNLAF airbases are assigned a dynamic bird status. These are based on actual observations by well trained bird controllers and determine both the level and intensity of bird control as well as the operational use of the airbase. The method used is discussed, some results are presented and gaps in knowledge are identified. A second instrument for containing the problem is the use of dedicated <b>bird</b> <b>radars</b> on airfields. These should be able to project the 3 D flight path of birds in relation to that of starting aircraft. The developments which take place within the FlySafe project as part of the Integrated Application Promotion Program of the European Space Agency are discussed. Both bird control units and air traffic control are parties that could turn this information into a safer runway environment.

40|$|A {{review of}} radar {{cross-section}} measurements {{of birds and}} insects is presented. A brief discussion of some possible theoretical models is also given and comparisons made with the measurements. The comparisons suggest that most targets are, at present, better modeled by a prolate spheroid having a length-to-width ratio between 3 and 10 than by the often used equivalent weight water sphere. In addition, many targets observed with linear horizontal polarization have maximum cross sections much better estimated by a resonant half-wave dipole than by a water sphere. Also considered are birds and insects in the aggregate as a local radar 'clutter' source. Order-of-magnitude estimates are given for many reasonable target number densities. These estimates are then used to predict X-band volume reflectivities. Other topics that are {{of interest to the}} radar engineer are discussed, including the doppler bandwidth due to the internal motions of a single <b>bird,</b> the <b>radar</b> cross-section probability densities of single birds and insects, the variability of the functional form of the probability density functions, and the Fourier spectra of single birds and insects...|$|R

40|$|Every year {{billions of}} birds migrate from {{breeding}} areas to their wintering ranges, some travelling over 10, 000 km. Stakeholders interested in aviation flight safety, spread of disease, conservation, education, urban planning, meteorology, wind turbines and bird migration ecology {{are interested in}} information on bird movements. Collecting and disseminating useful information about such mobile creatures exhibiting diverse behaviour is no simple task. However, ESA’s Integrated Application Promotion (IAP) programme may provide the solution with its system of systems philosophy, integrating space (Telecommunication, Navigation, Remote Sensing and Meteorology) assets in combination with terrestrial systems. FlySafe sustainable services could provide access to various existing radar systems and observation networks collecting information on bird migration, tracking of individual birds, enhancement of existing technologies, modelling tools, improved access to environmental data and web services. In the present situation radar measurements of birds are not comparable between countries and are covering {{only a part of}} Europe.

This can be reached by automatic generation of ad-hoc warnings and timely reliable predictions of increased bird strike hazard. The aim of FlySafe is to develop such a bird warning system of systems in Europe.

40|$|Track-while-scan bird radars {{are widely}} used in ornithological studies, but often the precise {{detection}} capabilities of these systems are unknown. Quantification of radar performance is essential to avoid observational biases, which requires practical methods for validating a radar’s detection capability in specific field settings. In this study a method to quantify the detection capability of a <b>bird</b> <b>radar</b> is presented, as well a demonstration of this method in a case study. By time-referencing line-transect surveys, visually identified birds were automatically linked to individual tracks using their transect crossing time. Detection probabilities were determined as the {{fraction of the total}} set of visual observations that could be linked to radar tracks. To avoid ambiguities in assigning radar tracks to visual observations, the observer’s accuracy in determining a bird’s transect crossing time was taken into account. The accuracy was determined by examining the effect of a time lag applied to the visual observations on the number of matches found with radar tracks. Effects of flight altitude, distance, surface substrate and species size on the detection probability by the radar were quantified in a marine intertidal study area. Detection probability varied strongly with all these factors, as well as species-specific flight behaviour. The effective detection range for single birds flying at low altitude for an X-band marine radar based system was estimated at ~ 1. 5 km. Within this range the fraction of individual flying birds that were detected by the radar was 0. 50 ± 0. 06 with a detection bias towards higher flight altitudes, larger birds and high tide situations. Besides radar validation, which we consider essential when quantification of bird numbers is important, our method of linking radar tracks to ground-truthed field observations can facilitate species-specific studies using surveillance radars. The methodology may prove equally useful for optimising tracking algorithms...|$|E

A key challenge in use of avian radars at both military and commercial airfields however has been integration of the greatly expanded level of risk information provided by avian radar technology into the current procedures and methods for setting bird strike risk conditions at airports and airfields.

40|$|Since 2005, the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) {{performs}} monthly BACI-designed surveys {{to study}} seabird displacement following {{the construction of}} offshore wind farms in the Belgian part of the North Sea. For {{the first time since}} its completion in 2013 we report our findings for the C-Power wind farm at the Thorntonbank, and we also give an update of the results for the Bligh Bank wind farm after five years of post-impact monitoring. Compared to earlier reports and publications, we introduced some improvements in our modelling strategy. To correct for decreasing detectability with distance, the seabird numbers observed were now distance-corrected, and by allowing the detection functions to vary with wind force or wave height, temporal variation due to observation conditions was further reduced. We also included a fishery factor in the model, allowing to correct for the presence of beam trawlers in the vicinity of our survey tracks. As expected, this factor often explained {{a significant part of the}} variation in the counted numbers of gulls and northern fulmars. Based on the resulting impact models, we found significant avoidance by northern gannet and common guillemot at both sites. Common guillemot decreased in densities by 68 % and 75 % at the Thorntonbank and Bligh Bank respectively, and northern gannet by 99 % and 82 %. Razorbill decreased in numbers at the two sites, this decrease being significant at the Bligh Bank only (67 %). Both sites attracted great black-backed gulls, this species having increased in numbers significantly by a factor 6. 4 and 3. 6 at the Thorntonbank and Bligh Bank respectively. The previously reported attraction effects of lesser black-backed gull and herring gull at the Bligh Bank were confirmed after two more years of monitoring, but no such effect was observed at the Thorntonbank. Finally, Sandwich tern appeared to be attracted to the offshore wind farm at the Thorntonbank, this effect being significant only for the buffer zone. This is in line with the results for the phase I of the Cpower wind farm when we also found attraction of Sandwich tern to the immediate surroundings of the six turbine wind farm. While the avoidance of common guillemot and northern gannet seems readily interpretable from a disturbance perspective, it is still difficult to pinpoint the observed increases in seabird numbers, even more so because these are not always consistent between both sites under study. Gaining more insight in the diurnal and tidal-dependent variation in numbers and behaviour of birds occurring inside the offshore wind farms seems indispensable for understanding the observed patterns and learning whether birds come to the wind farms merely for roosting and the related stepping stone function, or whether offshore wind farms also offer increased food availability. This should be investigated through oriented research making use of <b>bird</b> <b>radar</b> data, GPS tracking data of tagged gulls, fixed cameras and/or visual observations from a fixed location inside the wind farm...|$|E

C., Reitan, O., Steinheim, Y. & Vang, R. 2008. ”Pre- and post-construction {{studies of}} {{conflicts}} between birds and wind turbines in coastal Norway”. Progress Report 2008. – NINA Report 409. 55 pp. The NFR-funded project Pre- and post-construction studies of conflicts between birds and wind turbines in coastal Norway {{is about to}} end its second year of activities, and as such it has reached a stage of intensive fieldwork and data collection. Monitoring of bird mortality within the wind power plant area takes place {{on a weekly basis}} assisted by special trained dogs. So far in 2008 (as of December 1) 9 white-tailed sea eagles (WTSE) and 7 willow ptarmigans have been recorded. Another 4 common snipes, 2 hooded crow, 2 golden plovers, 2 greylag goose, one grey heron, one kittiwake, one herring/greater black-backed gull, one merlin and one redshank have been collected; i. e. a total of 31 victims so far in 2008. The willow ptarmigan population have been monitored in spring and autumn and 6 willow ptarmigans were trapped and radio-tagged (in January-March). The trapping efforts have now been resumed and another 8 birds have been radio-tagged (up to December 1). A new activity on eagle owl, funded by the Directorate for Nature Management, is included in the project. The objectives with this project are, among other things, to collect mortality data using radio telemetry. However additional funding is needed. With respect to waders and smaller passerines the field work in 2008 was performed at a planned wind power plant site in Northern Norway, Andøya, to document the breeding bird status prior to the construction. The project still concentrates heavily on WTSE research, and this summer another 9 nestlings were equipped with radio transmitters, of which 3 have quit transmitting. Feather samples for DNA-analyses are collected, and when the samples of 6 WTSE adult collision victims recorded in 2008 were compared to 2006 / 2007 samples, it turned out that they matched two territorial birds with territories approximately 1. 5 and 8 km from the wind power plant, respectively. A Master Thesis at the University of Science and Technology in Trondheim (NTNU) focusing possible effects of the wind power plant on WTSE nesting success was concluded in September. One of the conclusions was that territories within or close to the power plant had a lowered nesting success after construction, compared with the same territories before construction. Another master student has collected data on WTSE behaviour inside and outside the wind power plant area to identify possible turbine generated differences in behaviour. These data are now being processed and the Thesis will be finalized in spring 2009. An important incident this year was the procurement of a <b>bird</b> <b>radar</b> lab. After some trial and error with respect to siting within the power plant area, the radar has now been collecting data continuously since April 3. Data processing is now under way. To investigate MERLIN radar performance at its current location field trials with dedicated controlled targets have been performed using model aircraft. The MERLIN processing functions have a set of parameters which can be adjusted to each operational task and environment. The flight tests provide data which helps in optimizing these processing parameters. In connection to turbine 43 a total of 6 daylight and one IR camera have been installed to monitor bird flight behaviour close to the turbines and to learn more about how turbine generated turbulence may affect the bird’s ability to manoeuvre in the air. Another objective is to evaluate possible “early warning devices” and mitigating measures when birds get at a critical distance to a turbine. A significant effort has been put into the construction of functional operational systems for broadband transmission of data from the radar and camera systems on Smøla to NINA HQ in Trondheim. This is now in place and adequate storing and retrieving systems is being focused. Another effort is connected to developing a system for gathering all MERLIN GIS tools to be used in ArcGIS desktop 9. x. and also to develop tools for analysing collision tracks in ArcGIS desktop. An important task is the ongoing terrain modelling inside and outside the power plant area together with the ground clutter modelling and radar-coverage at different altitudes from the current MERLIN radar location. Finally we have developed a dynamic literature database (usind EndNote Web) for publications on birds and wind energy and related topics...|$|E
50|$|The S-300PMU-1 was {{introduced}} in 1999 {{and for the first}} time introduces several different kinds of missiles in a single system. In addition to the 5V55R and 48N6E missiles the S-300PMU-1 can utilise two new missiles, the 9M96E1 and 9M96E2. Both are significantly smaller than the previous missiles at 330 and 420 kg respectively) and carry smaller 24 kg warhead. The 9M96E1 has an engagement range of 1 - 40 km and the 9M96E2 of 1 - 120 km. They are still carried 4 per TEL. Rather than just relying on aerodynamic fins for manoeuvring, they use a gas-dynamic system which allows them to have an excellent probability of kill (Pk) despite the much smaller warhead. The Pk is estimated at 0.7 against a tactical ballistic missile for either missile. The S-300PMU-1 typically uses the 83M6E command and control system, although it is also compatible with the older Baikal-1E and Senezh-M1E CCS command and control systems. The 83M6E system incorporates the 64N6E (BIG <b>BIRD)</b> surveillance/detection <b>radar.</b> The fire control/illumination and guidance radar used is the 30N6E(1), optionally matched with a 76N6 low altitude detection radar and a 96L6E all altitude detection radar. The 83M6E command and control system can control up to 12 TELs, both the self-propelled 5P85SE vehicle and the 5P85TE towed launchers. Generally support vehicles are also included, such as the 40V6M tow vehicle, intended for lifting of the antenna post.|$|R
40|$|With the end {{of summer}} drawing near, the fall {{songbird}} migration season will soon begin. Scientists with the ARM Program will be able to observe the onset of the migration season as interference in the radar wind profiler (RWP) data. An RWP measures vertical profiles of wind and temperature directly above the radar from approximately 300 feet to 3 miles above the ground. The RWP accomplishes this by sending a pulse of electromagnetic energy skyward. Under normal conditions, the energy is scattered by targets in the atmosphere. Targets generally consist of atmospheric irregularities such as variations in temperature, humidity, and pressure over relatively short distances. During the spring and fall bird migration seasons, RWP beam signals are susceptible to overflying <b>birds.</b> The <b>radar</b> beams do not harm the birds, but the birds' presence hampers data collection by providing false targets to reflect the RWP beam, introducing errors into the data. Because of the wavelength of the molar beam, the number of individuals, and the small size of songbirds' bodies (compared to the larger geese or hawks), songbirds are quite likely to be sampled by the <b>radar.</b> Migrating <b>birds</b> usually fly with the prevailing wind, making their travel easier. As a result, winds from the south are ''enhanced'' or overestimated in the spring as the migrating birds travel northward, and winds from the north are overestimated in the fall as birds make their way south. This fact is easily confirmed by comparison of RWP wind data to wind data gathered by weather balloons, which are not affected by birds...|$|R
40|$|The nocturnal {{migration}} of many passerines starts after sunset and reaches peak intensity during the dark {{hours of the}} night. Birds destined for high Arctic breeding grounds encounter a special situation, as they will experience continuous daylight when reaching the high latitudes during the final part of spring migration. How does this affect the pattern of nocturnal migration? We consider three alternative hypotheses; that the period of nocturnal flight activity may become compressed, remain unchanged or become disorganized under Arctic light conditions. We tracked migrating <b>birds</b> by <b>radar</b> north of the Arctic Circle (at Abisko, 68210 N, 18490 E, in Swedish Lapland) and show that the pattern during the night, with a migration peak around midnight, persisted even in continuous daylight when the sun remained above the horizon throughout the 24 h of the day. The flight intensity peak under continuous daylight in spring (midnight sun) was {{very similar to the}} corresponding peak in autumn, when the migration took place under twilight conditions. The duration of the flight period under continuous daylight in spring lasted 8 – 10 h and {{did not seem to be}} compressed. We hypothesize that the flight period under midnight sun conditions may in fact be more protracted than during short nights, because of release from twilight cues that tend to synchronize initiation and termination of migratory flights. These cues will thus capture and confine the flight period. The results of this provisional study suggest interesting dynamics in timing of nocturnal migratory flights under seasonally and latitudinally changing day length conditions, which will need detailed documentation by future studies of migration intensity at high-latitude sites...|$|R
40|$|Collisions between {{birds and}} {{aircraft}} have caused loss {{of human life}} {{and millions of dollars}} worth of property damage. The advent of even larger planes may reduce airframe damage, but it seems doubtful that engine damage will be significantly reduced. Dealing with the problem biologically, involves combating the hazards caused both by birds on or near the ground at airfields, and by birds on mass migrations at altitudes up to several thousand feet above ground. Airports can be designed or altered to minimize their attraction to birds. The chance arrival of a flock of birds must be treated as an emergency with all available equipment and personnel used to ensure quick dispersal. The hazards caused by birds aloft must be dealt with by making it possible for aircraft to avoid the main bird flocks. Warnings of the immediate presence of birds can be given by air traffic control operators, trained to recognize <b>birds</b> on their <b>radar.</b> The ability to forecast the probable presence of flocks of birds on migration is now being developed...|$|R
