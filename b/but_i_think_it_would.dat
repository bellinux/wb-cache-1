500|$|Faulks {{stated that}} Devil May Care {{would be his}} only Bond book, saying: [...] "One tribute, one centenary, one book", adding [...] "My {{contract}} did offer me a second go, but definitely not... 'Once funny, twice silly, three times a slap', as the nanny saying goes. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a good gig for someone to do." [...] He saw his novel as {{a continuation of the}} Fleming books, saying [...] "I tried to put the films out of mind", adding that [...] "I prepared in a rather pedantic way by reading all of the books in chronological order and when I got to the end I wrote mine." ...|$|E
60|$|GENERAL HEINTZELMAN: Perhaps we could, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be ruinous to the country.|$|E
60|$|HOPE. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{not have}} hurt him, had he {{kept pace with}} us hitherto.|$|E
60|$|This had tickled Abramina hugely, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> tickled me fully more.|$|R
60|$|PHOEBE (curtsying). I {{have heard}} them {{speak of a}} dashing Mr. Brown. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> cannot be the same.|$|R
3000|$|C: <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{should be}} {{discussed}} differently. I cannot agree with you, I must say. How do you think? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then,' said he, wounded to the quick, 'your aunt {{might come}} and fetch you herself. Of {{course you can}} command me as you please. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be better so.' ...|$|E
60|$|SYLVIA (rising). You're too awful, Leonard. For shame? However, {{anything}} to oblige a fellow Ibsenite. I'll bear your affair in mind. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be more effective}} if you got Grace to do it.|$|E
60|$|You know, I don't {{want to be}} offensive, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a pity myself. And besides, unless I'm much mistaken, I've got {{a little}} score of my own that I want to pay off.|$|E
6000|$|... "Decidedly. That's a risk, and it {{has entered}} into my calculation. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> appreciable, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> small, and I'm {{prepared}} to take it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Smiling.] Don't take it too seriously. It really doesn't matter. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> far wiser that we shouldn't see {{one another}} again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't half {{believe in}} spirits myself. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> ghostly enough--what <b>I</b> was told. 'Twas {{a little boy}} that zid it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not, Dias, and I {{have no fear}} {{of their}} {{attempting}} it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be as well for us to close it, otherwise we could not cross {{from one side to}} the other without exposing ourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, dear friend, we {{will use}} the Magic Belt to {{transport}} your uncle and aunt from Kansas to the Emerald City. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be fitting, in receiving such distinguished guests, for us to sit in my Throne Room." ...|$|E
60|$|ELDER DANIELS. The Sheriff {{knows the}} law. I wouldnt say for sure; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be more seemly {{to have a}} witness. Go and round one up, Strapper; and leave me here alone to wrestle with his poor blinded soul.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not sure, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{is because}} there is me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was naughty of me to be born. Can you help being born?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Just now I am headachy, and seedy too; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is {{all coming}} right again. I {{hope to have}} a bright happy Christmas.|$|R

6000|$|... "I think I {{could stand}} it, uncle, for I {{have been out}} in wherries in some {{precious}} rough seas at Spithead; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be best for the chief to take my place this time, and then I shall see how I feel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Norman, pausing. [...] "I don't know, papa. I am {{very much}} obliged to you, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> hardly do. You would be uncomfortable at seeming to quarrel with Dr. Hoxton, {{and it would}} be hardly creditable for me to go off in anger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You should {{remember}} that she has something to forgive. I don't {{want you to be}} intimate with her <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be better if, instead of quarrelling openly, you wrote a note to say that you were deceived and that you are very sorry for what you brought on her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is wetted, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is {{only with}} tears," [...] {{answered}} the senior. [...] "I cannot {{keep it from}} the poor young gentleman." ...|$|R
60|$|This poem {{was first}} {{printed in the}} Annual called 'The Keep-sake.' The Painter's name I am not sure of, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was Holmes.|$|R

6000|$|... "It would indeed, also my temper," [...] {{he assured}} her. [...] "We {{are going to}} have a cocktail, you and I, within two minutes, young lady, and a steak afterwards. If you want to go in there with my hand on your neck, you can, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> look better--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that all}} depends on who you're engaged to," [...] {{answered}} Diana, with that maddening air of superior wisdom always assumed {{by those who are}} engaged over those who are not. [...] "It's perfectly lovely to be engaged to Fred [...] . <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be simply horrid to be engaged to anyone else." ...|$|E
6000|$|The President {{ordered the}} removal of that motto from the coin, and I {{thought that it was}} well. I thought that overstatement should not stay there. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> better read, [...] "Within certain judicious {{limitations}} we trust in God," [...] and if there isn't enough room on the coin for this, why, enlarge the coin.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{just saw}} something, back of yonder bushes," [...] he whispered, excitedly. [...] "I am not sure, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{was a couple}} of deer!" ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was a {{reasonable}} thing myself to omit the bounds from the formal-declarers <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was a terrible crime to omit the either or the flex-- Lindsey ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hem!' said Mrs Nickleby. 'I don't {{know about}} that, my dear, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is very {{necessary}} that somebody {{should be in}} his confidence; highly necessary.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's a most {{dramatic}} contrast, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be better on a summer's day,' I said, {{and we went}} on, {{up one of the}} noiseless rides, {{a quarter of a mile}} at least, till we came to the porticoed front of an enormous Georgian pile. Four footmen revealed themselves in a hall hung with pictures.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have no idea}} of kicking him, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be wrong}} to allow him to go on saying these frightful things of my mother, without showing him that we are not afraid of him."

6000|$|... "I'm afraid I'm very unbusinesslike," [...] {{he replied}} with some grimness. [...] "However, if Scott is willing, I'll {{help you to}} develop the mine and get your patent; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be prudent to let him join us.

6000|$|... 'I <b>think</b> not to-night. <b>I</b> {{will go to}} {{his room}} and {{ascertain}} how he is. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will be better not to see him to-night.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 1st Gent. Our deeds are fetters that we forge ourselves. [...] 2d Gent. Ay, truly: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is {{the world}} [...] That brings the iron.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm human," [...] he laughed. [...] "Perhaps I'd better mention <b>it.</b> <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> more to {{the purpose}} to say that I'm {{altogether}} at your disposal." ...|$|R
