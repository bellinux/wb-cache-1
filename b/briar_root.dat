50|$|The wood, {{known as}} <b>briar</b> <b>root</b> (French: bruyère), is {{extremely}} hard and heat-resistant, {{and is used}} for making smoking pipes. The football-sized tubers are harvested {{at the age of}} 30 to 60 years. They are cooked for several hours, then dried for several months before they are further processed. The wood is light brown to reddish brown, often beautifully textured, very hard, heat-resistant and does not affect the aroma of pipe tobacco smoke.|$|E
5000|$|Santa Maria Assunta: This parish church {{originally}} {{dates from}} the 6th-7th century, but rebuilt starting in 1530 by Giovanni Matteo Giberti, but construction ceased {{due to lack of}} funds, and the church, dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, was complete only in 1764. The door portals (1824) are made with white Veronese stone. The interior consists of three aisles. The eastern side rest on six heavy columns, the southern side on four lighter ones. They are all connected by round arches. The statues of Saints Peter and Paul (1886) were made by the Veronese sculptor Righetti. The large 14th-15th century wooden crucifix is a masterwork of the church. Behind the crucifix is the printed edict of Pope Innocent II (November 1138) resolving the allocation of tithes. The side altar of St Anthony of Padua dates from 1720. The altarpiece (1720) was painted by Simone Brentani and the statues in Carrara marble represent San Fabiano and San Sebastiano. The two walnut confessionals (17th century) were carved in the workshop of Andrea Brustolon in Rococo style. The side altar (1648) in the [...] "Capella dei Caduti" [...] contains the wooden statue [...] "Madonna and Child" [...] (Veronese style - 15th century). In the right aisle is located the side altar with the paintings of Saints Luigi Gonzaga and Vincenzo Ferreri by Gaspare Diziani (1764). The baptismal font {{dates from the}} 17th century. The main altar dates from mid 16th century and {{stands in front of the}} organ (1958). Behind the altar on the wall is an Assumption of Mary (17th century). The two statues of angels in front of the altar were sculpted by Francesco Filippini (1600). The pulpit was made out of <b>briar</b> <b>root</b> and walnut.|$|E
40|$|The tree heath (Erica arborea L.), a small {{evergreen}} tree {{found in}} the Mediterranean region and parts of Eastern and Central Africa, produces lignotubers that are highly valued for making smoking pipes. The Peloritani Mountains of northeastern Sicily are historically {{one of the most}} important areas in Italy for the production of these high quality lignotubers, known as <b>briar</b> <b>root</b> wood. In the past, tree heath shrublands were also an important source of charcoal. Erica arborea utilisation has declined dramatically during the past century, mostly due to the decreasing demand for smoking pipes, as well as the increasing frequency of wildfires and large-scale afforestation activities in this region. Until recent decades, Erica arborea management (grub felling), which represented an important economic activity for some local communities, also contributed to wildfire prevention by maintaining low heath tree cover which helped to inhibit fire spread. The majority of Erica arborea maquis is currently found on State-owned lands where traditional harvesting practices (i. e., uprooting trees) is discouraged, leading to higher density stands more susceptible to fire. At present, the tree heath industry is in sharp decline, with irregular management of the resource and poor commercial value of heath root wood due in part to frequent fires. Recently social trends and the establishment of new protected areas in tree heath shrublands discourage the utilization of Erica arborea and the conservation of the material culture and landscape associated with its management. It is proposed that tree heath cultivation be continued only in those areas best suited in order to preserve its cultural and environmental roles, and that forest management practices be improved to increase the economic viability of tree heath grub felling activities...|$|E
