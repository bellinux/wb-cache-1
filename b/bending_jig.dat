Samples were oxidised and mechanically deformed in air at 550 °C using strain rates of [MATH] 10 - 4 and 10 - 5 s- 1 in a bend test furnace having a ceramic 4 -point <b>bend</b> <b>jig.</b> The results were compared with earlier observations made on oxides deformed at room temperature. In both cases equidistant cracks formed and the crack spacing decreased with increasing oxide thickness in agreement with a model based on interfacial slip.

As the test sheets were treated by cataphoretic coating is this method described together with pretreatment of sheet. The practical part is focused on the principle multi-jet plasma system and treatment of the steel surface and examines the bent surfaces of the steel sheets with different variants of applying the coating. Selected samples are bent on the multifunction graduated <b>bending</b> <b>jig</b> and subjected to the Erichsen test and deduced results using plasma system and without the use of plasma system. In the experimental part were examined samples treated by multi-jet plasma system and subsequently bent on the multifunction graduated <b>bending</b> <b>jig.</b> Compares the results of individual experiments in system steel – base coat – plasma – topcoat. And also compares mutual combinations of various kinds of modifying the surfaces of steel samples with different coatings.

40|$|The biaxial piezospectroscopic {{coefficient}} (i. e., {{the rate}} of spectral shift with stress) of the electrostimulated near-band-gap luminescence of gallium nitride (GaN) was determined as Pi=- 25. 8 +/- 0. 2 meV/GPa. A controlled biaxial stress field was applied on a hexagonal GaN film, epitaxially grown on (0001) sapphire using a ball-on-ring biaxial <b>bending</b> <b>jig,</b> and the spectral shift of the electrostimulated near-band-gap was measured in situ in the scanning electron microscope. This calibration method can be useful to overcome {{the lack of a}} bulk crystal of relatively large size for more conventional uniaxial bending calibrations, which has so far hampered the precise determination of the piezospectroscopic coefficient of GaN. The main source of error involved with the present calibration method is represented by the selection of appropriate values for the elastic stiffness constants of both film and substrate. The ball-on-ring calibration method can be generally applied to directly determine the biaxial-stress dependence of selected cathodoluminescence bands of epilayer/substrate materials without requiring separation of the film from the substrate.

40|$|Rattan {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} non-timber forest products (NTFP) in the Philippines. It is in great demand for furniture and handicrafts for local and overseas markets. The country’s exports of rattan furniture alone averaged US$ 119 million per year from 1994 - 1998. Rattan is a climbing palm with unique physical and mechanical properties. It is light and has good strength properties but the main attribute of the material that influences product designs and quality, whether in round pole or split form, is its flexibility. Round poles can be bent into various forms and shapes for the structural and decorative components of rattan furniture and handicrafts. The bending of rattan poles into the desired shape is traditionally done with a blowtorch. This process produces scorch or burn marks on the surface of the bent items and this consequently degrades product quality and value. The most efficient bending method involves plasticizing the stocks for a suitable period in a steaming chamber prior to bending to the required shape with the aid of appropriate <b>bending</b> <b>jigs.</b> After this the bent pieces are dried to the required moisture content in restrained mode before product assembly. This is referred to as “steam bending”. The main equipment for steam-bending rattan poles that served as the model for this TOTEM was located inside the plant site at the Asia Rattan Manufacturing Company (ARMC), one of the four privately owned organizations that compose the AWECA group of companies based in Angeles City, Central Luzon. The ARMC and its sister companies have been the major beneficiaries of the technology transfer program of the FPRDI on rattan processing since 1987. ARMC cooperated in the documentation of the rattan pole steam-bending technology for this TOTEM. Steam-bending technology for rattan pole...|$|R

40|$|Development of the {{synovial}} joint is complex involving {{a sequence of}} precisely controlled events. Separation of the cartilage anlagen involves differential matrix turnover and requires mechanical stimuli, the loss of mechanical stimuli results in joint fusion. Synthesis of hyaluronan at the developing joint line occurs and its continued synthesis is necessary for maintenance of frictionless movement in the adult joint. Hyaluronan is synthesised by synovial fibroblasts and {{as a component of}} the synovial fluid and synovium, helps maintain a consistent volume and viscosity of synovial fluid when the joint is flexed. Reduction in hyaluronan concentration within the synovial fluid is associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Joints become painful to move and nihility is lost. The study aimed to investigate whether synovial cells from osteoarthritic knees were able to respond to mechanical stimuli and if so, were cells able to modulate hyaluronan synthesis. Results at the cellular level would be the first step in considering exercise based therapies as a treatment for osteoarthritis. A four point <b>bending</b> mechanical loading <b>jig</b> was used to apply mechanical strain to synovial cells. Results indicate that synovial cells from osteoarthritic knees are capable of responding to a brief period of mechanical stimuli and modulate hyaluronan release. Differential expression of the three HAS genes was also observed upon mechanical strain. It was clear however, that the response to strain varied depending on cell passage. As a result, the development of an immortalised synovial cell line was investigated. Data obtained however, showed that ectopic hTERT expression alone was not sufficient to immortalise synovial cells. Development of exercise based therapies for the treatment of osteoarthritis will require a considerable amount of further work. This study however, has demonstrated that alterations in hyaluronan synthase expression and subsequent hyaluronan synthesis by synovial cells occurs upon mechanical stimuli and thus provides a foundation for future studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{offshore}} oil industry is constantly seeking {{new and more}} cost efficient solutions to every aspect of their operations. In the later years, use of polymeric composite materials has proven to reduce cost and enhance reliability in several areas of oil operations. Several independent efforts, notably in Europe and in the US have targeted development of both spoolable and segmented fibre reinforced polymer pipe systems. These composite pipe systems have been designed for high internal pressure applications, with additional loads being both static and dynamic. In this research, the short-term, high strain, cyclic bending fatigue of spoolable glass-fibre reinforced epoxy pipes designed for high-pressure static chemical injection line service (SSI) was investigated. Bending and torsion fatigue loading may occur during pipe laying operations. Bending (static and fatigue) of composite pipe was simulated experimentally using a self-designed four-point <b>bending</b> <b>jig</b> on a 25 metric ton MTS hydraulic testing machine. Comparisons between experimental results, simple analytical and numerical static solutions were executed. Numerical solutions for static analysis were found using I-DEAS Master Series 5. 0 finite element analysis software. The research effort also attempted to utilise a finite element software developed at McGill University to predict fatigue behaviour of the composite pipe. Findings in this research effort assist understanding of short-term, high strain, fatigue behaviour of spoolable composite pipes designed for static high pressure operations, as well as indicate {{the validity of the}} finite-element analysis efforts executed in this research...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the biomechanical behaviour {{of a novel}} distraction-stabilization system, consisting of an intervertebral distraction bolt, polyaxial screws and connecting rods, in the canine lumbosacral spine. Study design: Biomechanical study. Sample population: Cadaveric canine lumbosacral spines (L 4 -Cd 3) (N= 8) Methods: Cadaveric lumbosacral spines were harvested, stripped of musculature, mounted on a 4 -point <b>bending</b> <b>jig,</b> and tested in extension, flexion and lateral bending using non-destructive compressive axial loads (0 - 150 N). Angular displacement was recorded from reflective optical trackers rigidly secured to L 6, L 7 and S 1. Data for primary and coupled motion were collected from intact spines; after destabilization at L 7 -S 1, and following surgical stabilisation with the new implant system. Results: As compared with the intact spine, laminectomy resulted in a modest increase in angular displacement at L 6 -L 7 and a marked increase at L 7 -S 1. Instrumentation significantly reduced motion at the operated level (L 7 -S 1) with a concomitant increase at the adjacent level (L 6 -L 7). Conclusion: The combination of a polyaxial pedicle screw-rod system and intervertebral spacer provides a versatile solution of surgical stabilisation of the lumbosacral joint following surgical decompression in the canine lumbosacral spine. The increase in motion at L 6 -L 7 may suggest the potential for adjacent level effects and clinical trials should be designed to address this question. Clinical relevance: These results support the feasibility of using this new implant system {{for the management of}} degenerative lumbosacral disease in dogs. The increase in motion at L 6 -L 7 may suggest the potential for adjacent level effects and clinical trials should be designed to address this question...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this biomechanical {{study was to investigate}} the effect of decompressive surgery, specifically dorsal laminectomy and discectomy, on the stability of the lumbosacral joint in the dog. Different size laminectomies were compared with respect to their effect on lumbosacral stability. A total of eighteen lumbosacral motion units were collected from cadavers and divided into three groups. Group 1 was a control group and received no modification, Group 2 specimens received mini-dorsal laminectomies and discectomies (lamina of L 7 caudal to the dorsal spinous process excised, lamina of S 1 not affected) while Group 3 specimens received standard dorsal laminectomies and discectomies (75 % of L 7 lamina and 50 % of S 1 lamina excised). All specimens were potted in aluminium tubing and mounted in a four-point <b>bending</b> <b>jig</b> and tested in a load cell. Specimens were stressed to 21 ° in dorsiflexion and ventroflexion. The relevant surgical modification was then performed and the specimens re-tested to 21 ° in dorsiflexion and ventroflexion. All specimens were then tested to failure in ventroflexion. Force and angular displacement was recorded and used to obtain load-deformation curves for each specimen (5 curves for each specimen). From the load-deformation curves the stiffness (gradient of the graph) was determined at three set angles of deflection. These points were 6 °- 8 °, 12 °- 16 ° and 18 °- 20 °. The percentage change in stiffness for each specimen in both dorsiflexion and ventroflexion was obtained. Peak force at failure and angular deformation at failure were obtained when tested to failure in ventroflexion. When examining the overall stiffness of the specimen (dorsiflexion and ventroflexion and all angles of deflection) mini-dorsal laminectomy was shown to result in a 48. 3 % reduction in stiffness (P < 0. 001) while standard dorsal laminectomy and discectomy resulted in a 59. 8 % reduction in stiffness (P < 0. 001). These results were statistically significant. The difference between the two different types of laminectomies could be described as approaching significance (P= 0. 066). Larger group size would be required to determine whether this is in fact statistically significant Dorsal laminectomy combined with discectomy does {{have an effect on the}} stability of the lumbosacral joint. This may contribute to the relatively high recurrence rate following surgical treatment of degenerative lumbosacral stenosis especially in large breed highly active dogs. The study provides further support for decompressive surgery combined with a stabilisation technique when treating degenerative lumbosacral stenosis. It also provides potential support for the use of mini-dorsal laminectomies. Dissertation (MMedVet) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010. Companion Animal Clinical Studiesunrestricte...|$|E
