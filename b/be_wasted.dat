5|$|Loving's early {{adulthood}} involved several stints in the U.S. Army as a musician, and later regimental bandleader. A later {{period of study}} at the New England Conservatory of Music ended when Loving decided to rejoin the Army over the protests of his professors, who believed his talent as a cornetist would <b>be</b> <b>wasted.</b> After withdrawing from the conservatory, Loving was given command of the band of the 45th United States Volunteer Infantry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|No {{time was}} to <b>be</b> <b>wasted</b> on {{elaborate}} drawings; charts and plans should have notes and simple {{views of the}} land {{as seen from the}} sea showing measured heights of hills. Continued records of tides and meteorological conditions were also required. An additional suggestion was for a geological survey of a circular coral atoll in the Pacific Ocean including its profile and of tidal flows, to investigate the formation of such coral reefs.|$|E
5|$|Once, Veda {{left his}} ashram (hermitage), entrusting {{all of the}} {{administrative}} duties to Uttanka. Veda's wife was then in her menstrual period. The women of the ashram urged Uttanka to cohabit with her so that her fertility period would not <b>be</b> <b>wasted,</b> but Uttanka refused to oblige as he was duty bound to his guru and he considered the act immoral. When this episode was conveyed to Veda upon {{his return to the}} ashram, he was pleased with his disciple and blessed Uttanka.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} <b>waste,</b> one should <b>be</b> {{able to recognize}} it.

5|$|After {{his final}} season at Michigan, Robinson {{stated that he}} was open to playing any {{position}} in the National Football League. Some suggested {{that he would have}} a better chance of being drafted by an NFL team if he switched to cornerback, receiver, running back or kick returner because of his quickness – 4.35 in the 40 yard dash. CBS Sports' Mike Freeman said his talents would <b>be</b> <b>wasted</b> on the defensive side of the ball. Doug Flutie (Buffalo Bills) and Dieter Brock (Los Angeles Rams) were relatively successful quarterbacks similar in stature to Robinson. Russell Wilson who currently plays starting quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks is also similar in stature to Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Sumner Sloane (Michael McGuire), Diane's ex-fiancé who jilted her in {{the series}} pilot, returns to Cheers, {{surprising}} bar patrons. Alone in the billiard room, Sumner tells Diane that, against her will, he submitted one of her unfinished manuscripts {{to one of his}} colleagues, who praised it, and was sent to publishers. At first, she becomes excited. However, Sumner persuades her to leave everyone and everything behind, including Sam, in order to hone her talents. He warns her that finishing the novel is impossible and that her potentials will <b>be</b> <b>wasted</b> if she marries Sam. Diane tells Sumner to leave the bar and never return again. Unbeknownst to them, Sam overhears this conversation under the pool table whose underneath is covered by drapes.|$|E
5|$|Talented but temperamental, Pistrucci {{refused to}} copy the work of other artists. When in 1823 George IV demanded that an unflattering {{portrait}} of him on the coinage be changed with a new likeness {{to be based on}} the work of Francis Chantrey, Pistrucci refused and was nearly sacked. The Mint did not dismiss him, lest the money already spent on the Waterloo Medal <b>be</b> <b>wasted.</b> Pistrucci kept his place with the Mint for the rest of his life, eventually completing the Waterloo Medal in 1849, though because of its great size it could not be struck. After Pistrucci's death, the George and Dragon design was restored to the sovereign coin, and is still used today.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{had very}} {{little in the way of}} heavy weapons, as they had {{discarded}} most of their artillery and machine guns due to lack of ammunition. Despite the chronic ammunition shortage von Lettow-Vorbeck was able to move four machine guns up close to the rifle pits, using them only at close range to ensure his ammunition would not <b>be</b> <b>wasted.</b> The inexperience of the Portuguese proved to be their downfall; despite their firing over 30,000 rounds, German casualties were extremely light, including only one casualty among their officers. Taking heavy casualties, having lost their commanding officer, and finding themselves hopelessly outnumbered, the Portuguese finally surrendered despite the fact that they had enough military supplies to continue the action.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the three-cent nickel piece {{remained}} stable throughout its run, and there are few varieties. An overdate is known, 1887/6. The die that struck those coins was originally dated 1886, when no circulation strikes were made. So the die would not <b>be</b> <b>wasted,</b> the Mint altered the last digit from a 6 to a 7; evidence of both numbers is visible. Some 1865 pieces in proof condition display a wreath on the reverse that comes much closer to touching the rim than on later issues. These were most likely pattern coins but they are accepted as issued because the Mint placed them in some 1865 proof sets. Many of the three-cent nickel pieces were not fully struck, and are missing details of the design; {{this is because the}} head of Liberty is directly opposite the III, and the Mint had trouble getting the hard metal alloy to adequately flow to the high points of both sides.|$|E

25|$|Energy {{development}} is the field of activities focused on obtaining sources of energy from natural resources. These activities include production of conventional, alternative and renewable sources of energy, and for the recovery and reuse of energy that would otherwise <b>be</b> <b>wasted.</b> Energy conservation and efficiency measures reduce the demand for energy development, and can have benefits to society with improvements to environmental issues.|$|E
25|$|Autonomous {{buildings}} {{can increase}} security and reduce environmental impacts by using on-site resources (such as sunlight and rain) {{that would otherwise}} <b>be</b> <b>wasted.</b> Autonomy often dramatically reduces the costs and impacts of networks that serve the building, because autonomy short-circuits the multiplying inefficiencies of collecting and transporting resources. Other impacted resources, such as oil reserves and the retention of the local watershed, can often be cheaply conserved by thoughtful designs.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Party also {{divided on}} a {{strategy}} for contesting the general election. Most Democrats heading into the May convention decided to not oppose the governorship and other state offices because Governor Daniel Henry Chamberlain had implemented many favorable reforms. Known as fusionists, they also felt that any effort spent on state offices would <b>be</b> <b>wasted</b> and better served by trying to acquire {{a majority in the}} General Assembly.|$|E

25|$|Boosted fission weapons {{improve on}} the {{implosion}} design. The {{high pressure and temperature}} environment {{at the center}} of an exploding fission weapon compresses and heats a mixture of tritium and deuterium gas (heavy isotopes of hydrogen). The hydrogen fuses to form helium and free neutrons. The energy release from this fusion reaction is relatively negligible, but each neutron starts a new fission chain reaction, speeding up the fission and greatly reducing the amount of fissile material that would otherwise <b>be</b> <b>wasted</b> when expansion of the fissile material stops the chain reaction. Boosting can more than double the weapon's fission energy release.|$|E

In his speech, Thessalus said that the King of Persia demanded earth and water from Coans but they refused (493 BCE) so he gave the island to Artemisia to <b>be</b> <b>wasted.</b> Artemisia led a fleet of ships to the island of Cos to hunt down and slaughter the Coans, but the gods intervened. After Artemisia's ships were destroyed by lightning and she hallucinated visions of great heroes, she fled Cos with her purpose unfulfilled. But afterwards she conquered the island.|$|E

These were reserved for duties requiring close combat engagements, simply because their skill and experience was too valuable to <b>be</b> <b>wasted</b> in other less complicated duties. The war attracted foreign fighters and mercenaries from various countries. Volunteers came to fight {{for a variety of reasons}} including religious or ethnic loyalties and in some cases for money. As a general rule, Bosniaks received support from Islamic countries, Serbs from Eastern Orthodox countries, and Croats from Catholic countries. The presence of foreign fighters is well documented, however none of these groups comprised more than 5 percent of any of the respective armies' total manpower strength.|$|E
