Ince, though, had a successful first season, playing in all but four of Inter's league matches and performing well after a slow start which had started speculation that he could <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back to the English Premier League {{as early as the}} November transfer window - with Arsenal and Newcastle United both reported to be interested. However, he would remain in Milan for two seasons.|$|E

However, the Nets were able to turn things around at the beginning of 2014 and finished the season with a 44-38 record, while Kidd began to get recognition for his coaching skills.|$|E

25|$|Although the Vikings {{held the}} wind {{advantage}} {{again during the}} final quarter, the Giants defense managed to shut them down to preserve the victory. The Vikings had a great chance {{to tie the game}} when Carter caught a deep pass from backup quarterback Sean Salisbury and appeared to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to a sure touchdown, but safety Myron Guyton caught up with him from behind and knocked the ball out of his hands. Jackson recovered it for the Giants on the Vikings 15-yard line to put the game away.|$|E
25|$|Newell {{started his}} summer {{spending}} by quickly securing Barry Conlon and Joe Widdowson {{on a permanent}} basis. Paul Linwood was brought in from Chester City, should hugely targeted Ryan Bennett <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way,</b> but after rejecting two offers from Peterborough United, the club tied the young skipper on an improved 4-year contract. Newell also managed to bring in former loan players Adrian Forbes and Peter Sweeney, as well as Nick Colgan, Michael Leary and Chris Jones to finish his squad refurbishing. The Mariners had a mixed pre-season, consisting of a 12–1 thrashing of Winterton Rangers, a creditable 1–1 draw with Leeds United, as well as losses to Stockport and Doncaster. Season Ticket sales for the 2009–10 campaign had smashed through the previous season's sales, adding up to around 2,500 tickets, a creditable total considering the economic climate.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ensuing}} kickoff, the Browns {{got the ball}} on their own 25-yard line. Byner started out the drive with a 16-yard burst and a 2-yard run, and then Kosar {{completed}} two passes to Brennan for 33 total yards. Following an encroachment penalty on defensive lineman Andre Townsend and a 6-yard run by Byner, an offsides penalty on Denver linebacker Karl Mecklenburg moved {{the ball to the}} Broncos 8-yard line with 1:12 remaining in regulation. The Browns had moved 67 yards in just six plays covering 2:41. On the next play, Byner took a handoff and appeared to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to score the game-tying touchdown. But he was stripped of the ball by Broncos defensive back Jeremiah Castille, and fumbled at the 2-yard line. The Broncos recovered the fumble (Castille made the recovery), gave the Browns an intentional safety, and went on to win 38–33.|$|E

25|$|At this point, {{the game}} {{appeared}} to be over. However, the Steelers were forced to advance the ball towards another score instead of taking a quarterback kneel because the Colts still had three timeouts remaining. But on Pittsburgh's first play, in which Bettis tried to punch it in for an insurance touchdown, he fumbled {{for the first time}} all season when linebacker Gary Brackett popped it from Bettis' hands with his helmet. Indianapolis defensive back Nick Harper recovered the ball and appeared to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> for an Indy touchdown that would have given the Colts the lead when Roethlisberger made a season saving tackle at the Colts' 42-yard line, spinning around and grabbing his ankle. Eventually, the Colts then advanced to the Pittsburgh 28-yard line, but Vanderjagt, who had been perfect at home in the playoffs, missed a 46-yard game-tying field goal attempt wide right with 17 seconds left, and the Steelers ran out the clock.|$|E
25|$|The Diana {{sailed to}} the island of Eetooroop and made contact {{with a group of}} Ainu (or Kuriles) who had been sent by the Japanese to {{investigate}} the Europeans. Golovnin proceeded to meet the Japanese military commander of the island, declaring his intention to collect wood and water and then <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way.</b> The commander stated that they couldn't trust the Russians due to the actions of Chwostoff, he agreed to send a letter to other commanders granting them access to supplies at the town of 'Oorbeetsch'. The Russians set sail, but were then intercepted by a 'baidare' (a sort of Kayak) with the Kuriles on board, as well as a newcomer; Alexei Maximovitsch. Alexei joined the Russians as an interpreter, though his proficiency in Russian was low. Many of these Kuriles came from Russian-controlled islands and had been punished for Chwostoff's attack on Japanese settlements, thus feared and resented the Japanese. Moreover, the Japanese had brutally crushed an Ainu rebellion in 1789.|$|E
25|$|On the 49ers' {{first drive}} of the game, wide {{receiver}} Jerry Rice caught {{a very long}} pass from quarterback Joe Montana and appeared to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> for a 50-yard touchdown; however, the future Hall of Famer inexplicably fumbled the football into the Giants end zone without being touched. (John Madden said during the telecast that the artificial turf at Giants Stadium {{may have been a}} factor.) Giants safety Kenny Hill recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchback. New York then drove 80 yards in 10 plays to score on Simms' 24-yard touchdown to tight end Mark Bavaro. San Francisco responded with a 26-yard field goal by Ray Wersching, but in the second quarter, Giants safety Herb Welch intercepted a pass from Montana and lateralled the ball to Elvis Patterson, who ran for 16 yards before being tackled. New York then converted with the turnover into a touchdown on Joe Morris' 45-yard run.|$|E

25|$|Dallas scored {{first on}} a 14-play, 88-yard drive in which Troy Aikman {{completed}} four passes to Michael Irvin for 65 yards {{and finished the}} drive with a 2-yard touchdown run. Perhaps the key point of the game occurred on the next series when Minnesota running back Amp Lee caught a short pass from quarterback Brad Johnson and appeared to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> for a 43-yard touchdown. But Cowboys safety George Teague caught up with Lee at the 1-yard line and poked {{the ball out of}} his hands, knocking it out of the end zone for a touchback. Dallas then drove 70 yards, including a 22-yard carry by Herschel Walker, to go up 10-0 on Chris Boniol's 28-yard field goal. Five plays after the ensuing kickoff, Teague stripped the ball from Vikings running back Leroy Hoard. Defensive back Deion Sanders recovered the fumble and lateraled it to Shante Carver, who was tackled on the Minnesota 37, and Emmitt Smith took off for a 37-yard touchdown run on the next play. Then during Minnesota's next possession, Teague intercepted a pass from Johnson and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown, giving the Cowboys a 24-0 lead with 8:36 left in the second quarter.|$|E

500|$|During the 2008–09 season, Walker came on as a {{substitute}} in Middlesbrough's 5–1 home win over Yeovil Town in the League Cup. In January 2009, he started his first game for the club, playing the whole 90 minutes in the club's 2–1 FA Cup victory against Barrow. His performance led to him starting once more the following week, in a 1–1 draw with Sunderland in the Tees–Wear derby. Just four days later, Walker was ruled out for six weeks after tests showed torn lateral ligaments. In February 2009, after impressing Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate, Walker signed a new two-year contracting, keeping him at Middlesbrough until 2011. In total, Walker featured nine times during the club's 2008–09 campaign. The following season, Walker did not play in the first-team until February 2010, when he started in Middlesbrough's 1–0 home win over Peterborough United – after injuries forced Middlesbrough manager Gordon Strachan to play Walker. It was to be his only appearance of the season for the club, and admitted he [...] "could still <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> out". Walker remained at the club ahead of the 2010–11 season, and he started in their 2–1 away win at Chesterfield in the League Cup. However, ten days later, Walker was allowed to leave the club, and joined fellow Championship side Watford on a free transfer.|$|E

500|$|Results {{continued}} {{to go against}} the Vale though, as on 19 March they lost 3–0 at Accrington Stanley, {{and as a result}} dropped out of the play-off zone {{for the first time in}} the season. Ugly post-match scenes at the Crown Ground saw Geohaghon confront fans who singled him out for abuse, whilst Gannon was ushered quietly out of the back door. Roberts told the media [...] "I don't think the manager likes me and, to be honest, I don't like him". Rumours circulated that Gannon would soon <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> out. These rumours were proved accurate two days later, as Gannon's departure was confirmed by the club. Hugely unpopular with Vale supporters, his sacking was [...] "quick and with little emotion", whilst his poor man-management skills helped to earn him the dubious honour of having the shortest reign in the club's history. Despite this he did receive credit for spotting the potential talent in a teenage Sam Morsy, and for bringing Tom Pope to the club. Gannon himself made a statement on his website declaring his disappointment in the club's decision to terminate his contract after such a short period of time, and also bemoaned that he [...] "wasn't able to add many new players [...] ". The [...] "Valiants" [...] {{continued to}} struggle under caretaker manager Mark Grew, winning just two of their remaining ten games, and finishing 2010–11 in eleventh place.|$|E

After leading at the white flag, Brad Keselowski made a move to the inside that Hamlin left open, which led to Hamlin driving into Keselowski in a failed attempt to block him, ultimately ending their chances at winning. As the collision happened, Keselowski's teammate Joey Logano was able to avoid the incident on the high side and ultimately won the event {{for the first time in}} his career over Kyle Busch and Alex Bowman.

2500|$|Entering {{high school}} at [...] and , Williams added an {{additional}} [...] of weight before his junior season. Due to his love of physical contact, Williams played outside linebacker and strong safety {{in addition to his}} primary position of running back. During his high school career, he rushed for a total of 4,129 yards and 55 touchdowns, and in his senior season he ran for 2,099 yards and 25 touchdowns, totals which earned him the San Diego Union-Tribunes 1994 Player of the Year award. Among his senior year performances were a 200-yard effort in a loss to Helix High School, a 248-yard (on 24 carries) and three touchdown game in a 26–3 win at Chula Vista, a 215-yard (21 carries) and two touchdown showing in a 13–3 win against Mira Mesa, a 143-yard (18 carries) and two touchdown game in a 28–10 victory over Point Loma, and a 129-yard (24 carries) and one touchdown game against top-ranked Morse which included Williams totaling 47 of the 69 yards Patrick Henry accumulated during the game-winning drive in a 20–17 upset. Two weeks after the win over Morse, Patrick Henry clinched its first Eastern League title in 11 years with a 21–12 win against San Diego High School; Williams appeared to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to a record-setting performance with 115 yards and two touchdowns {{in the first quarter of}} the game but suffered a leg injury on the third play of the second quarter. After being helped off the field he reentered the game and attempted one more carry but had to be carried off the field again, finished for the day. Following two weeks of rest, Williams was able to suit up in the first round of the CIF-San Diego Section Division 1 playoffs against San Dieguito and, playing through pain from the leg injury, post 94 yards on 25 carries in a 15–14 win. In the second round Williams ran for 110 yards in a 21–17 victory over Rancho Buena Vista, propelling Patrick Henry into the championship game at Jack Murphy Stadium for a rematch with Morse. However, in the title game Patrick Henry lost 13–0 and Williams would be held to a season-low 46 yards, with his team amassing just 62 yards of total offense.|$|E
