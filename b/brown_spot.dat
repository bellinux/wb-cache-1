5|$|Madeleine {{was born}} in Leicester and lived with her family in Rothley, also in Leicestershire. At the request of her parents, she was made a ward of court in England shortly after the disappearance, which gave the court {{statutory}} powers to act on her behalf. Police described Madeleine as blonde haired, with blue-green eyes, a small <b>brown</b> <b>spot</b> on her left calf, and a distinctive dark strip on the iris of her right eye. In 2009 the McCanns released age-progressed images of how she may have looked at age six, and in 2012 Scotland Yard commissioned one of her at age nine.|$|E
5|$|The forehead, lores, crown, mantle, and {{scapular}} {{area are}} a neutral grey colour. There is a <b>brown</b> <b>spot</b> on the nape. The {{top of the}} tail is brown, and the bottom is faintly striped brown. The bird's back and rump are striped brown-sepia, and the throat, breast, and belly are grey-white. Its lower belly and flanks are tawny. The iris is dark brown. Male specimens are distinguished by having less sharp brown spots on their napes, and {{the bottom of their}} breasts are mixed with a pale buff colour. The legs are brown on the back and whitish on the front. Young birds have a yellowish appearance with striped brown flanks.|$|E
5|$|The {{subspecies}} avicenniae {{differs from}} the nominate by its smaller size. It also varies as its nape to back is a dull grey colour. The <b>brown</b> <b>spot</b> present {{at the back of}} the head of the nominate is also reduced or gone. The lower back is toned a slight olive, and the underparts are also slightly paler than the nominate, but without white feathers. Avicenniaes upper wing-coverts are also more greenish-grey. The similar but smaller rufous-necked wood rail can be differentiated from the grey-necked wood rail by the former's reddish head and neck with a grey upper back.|$|E
50|$|This goniodorid nudibranch is {{translucent}} {{white in}} colour with brown patches or stripes composed of small <b>brown</b> <b>spots</b> interspersed with white pigment. The pre-rhinophoral papillae, rhinophore clubs and gills are similarly mottled with brown {{and there is}} a line of <b>brown</b> <b>spots</b> along the ridge of the tail. There are two extra-branchial papillae which are translucent white with a band of <b>brown</b> <b>spots</b> below the tip.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 19 mm. The forewings {{are covered with}} dark yellow, brown-tipped scales and with two dark <b>brown</b> <b>spots</b> about one-third and three very small indistinct dark <b>brown</b> <b>spots</b> at three-fourths. The hindwings are grey. Adults are on wing in May and July.|$|R
50|$|Adults have {{translucent}} wings with <b>brown</b> <b>spots.</b>|$|R
5|$|The three {{subspecies}} {{also differ}} in their colour. A. m. angolensis has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, dark brown stripes on the face extending two-thirds down to the snout. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is dark brown. The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright white face by a dark brown border. A <b>brown</b> <b>spot</b> is seen on the nose. A. m. hofmeyri is a light fawn, with thin, dark brown face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. The forehead patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond {{the level of the}} eyes and mixes with the white of the face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale smudge. A. m. marsupialis is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is deep brown. The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.|$|E
5|$|The winter fur is dense, {{but short}} and closely fitting. In {{northern}} subspecies, the fur {{is soft and}} silky, but coarse in southern forms. The summer fur is very short, sparser and rougher. The upper parts in the summer fur are dark, but vary geographically from dark-tawny or dark-chocolate to light pale tawny or sandy. The lower parts, including the lower jaw and inner sides of the legs, are white. There is often a <b>brown</b> <b>spot</b> {{at the corner of}} the mouth. The dividing line between the dark upper and light lower parts is usually straight but sometimes forms an irregular line. The tail is brown, and sometimes the tip is a little darker but it is never black. In the northern part of its range and at high altitudes, the least weasel changes colour in the winter, the coat becoming pure white and exhibiting a few black hairs in rare circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Varroa mites can be {{seen with}} the naked eye as a small red or <b>brown</b> <b>spot</b> on the bee's thorax. Varroa mites are {{carriers}} for many viruses that are damaging to bees. For example, bees infected during their development will often have visibly deformed wings.|$|E

50|$|Uropterygius fuscoguttatus is a moray eel {{found in}} coral reefs in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is {{commonly}} known as the <b>brown</b> <b>spotted</b> snake moray, <b>brown</b> snake moray, or the finless moray. It is mostly dark brown in colour, with darker <b>brown</b> <b>spots</b> approaching the tail.|$|R
25|$|Rice blast, {{caused by}} the fungus Magnaporthe grisea, is the most {{significant}} disease affecting rice cultivation. Other major rice diseases include: sheath blight, rice ragged stunt (vector: BPH), and tungro (vector: Nephotettix spp). There is also an ascomycete fungus, Cochliobolus miyabeanus, that causes <b>brown</b> <b>spot</b> disease in rice.|$|E
25|$|Later in {{the same}} year, five natural {{disasters}} struck: first, the winter rice crop was afflicted by a lengthy and virulent outbreak of fungal <b>brown</b> <b>spot</b> disease (caused by the fungus Cochliobolus miyabeanus). During this outbreak, a cyclone and three storm surges in October ravaged croplands, destroyed houses, and killed thousands. The cyclone also dispersed high levels of fungal spores widely across the region, increasing {{the spread of the}} crop disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{carapace}} of {{the turtle}} has various color patterns that change over time. Hatchlings of Chelonia mydas, {{like those of}} other marine turtles, have mostly black carapaces and light-colored plastrons. Carapaces of juveniles turn dark brown to olive, while those of mature adults are either entirely brown, spotted or marbled with variegated rays. Underneath, the turtle's plastron is hued yellow. C. mydas limbs are dark-colored and lined with yellow, and are usually marked with a large dark <b>brown</b> <b>spot</b> {{in the center of}} each appendage.|$|E
50|$|Young Henry Green loves {{chocolate}} so much, he eats it everyday {{and puts}} it on everything: chocolate mashed potatoes, chocolate-sprinkled noodles, chocolate marshmallows. Then one day at school, Henry notices that he is breaking out in little <b>brown</b> <b>spots.</b> His teacher rushes him to the school nurse, who determines that Henry has a strange rash. The teacher and the nurse both notice a mysterious odor of chocolate in the air. The small <b>brown</b> <b>spots</b> begin turning into larger <b>brown</b> <b>spots,</b> with an audible popping noise. Alarmed, the nurse sends Henry to the hospital.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 31 mm. The forewings are light <b>brown,</b> the costa <b>spotted</b> with black. There is a basal and inner oblique row of dark <b>brown</b> <b>spots,</b> {{as well as}} a median row of large <b>brown</b> <b>spots.</b> There are also three silvery spots and a broad outer brown shade, edged on either side with dark brown and then fawn. The hindwings are dull blackish brown.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 17 mm. The forewings are creamy {{white in the}} basal half and scattered with yellowish brown scales beyond half. There are two distinct <b>brown</b> discal <b>spots</b> at the middle and the end, as well as four dark <b>brown</b> <b>spots</b> near the middle along the costa. The subterminal line consists of indistinct <b>brown</b> <b>spots</b> {{and there is a}} row of distinct spots along the termen. The hindwings are grey.|$|R
2500|$|The {{issue of}} the degree of crop {{shortfall}} in late 1942 and its impact in 1943 has come to dominate the historiography of the Bengal famine. The issue {{lies at the heart of}} a larger debate over the relative importance of food availability decline(FAD) versus the failure of exchange entitlements(FEE) as causes of famine. Both the FAD and FEE lines of thought would agree that Bengal experienced at least some level of grain shortage in 1943 due to the loss of imports from Burma, damage from the cyclone, and <b>brown</b> <b>spot</b> infestation. Crucially, however, FEE analyses do not consider it the main factor, while FAD-oriented analyses of scholars such as , , [...] and [...] hold that a sharp drop in the food supply was the pivotal determining factor. [...] and [...] in particular argue that the impact of <b>brown</b> <b>spot</b> disease was vastly underestimated, both during the famine and in later analyses. The signs of crop fungal infestation by Cochliobolus miyabeanus are subtle; given the social and administrative conditions at the time, local officials would very likely have overlooked them.|$|E
2500|$|Shade {{tobacco is}} {{cultivated}} in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Early Connecticut colonists acquired from the Native Americans {{the habit of}} smoking tobacco in pipes, and began cultivating the plant commercially, though the Puritans {{referred to it as}} the [...] "evil weed". The Connecticut shade industry has weathered some major catastrophes, including a devastating hailstorm in 1929, and an epidemic of <b>brown</b> <b>spot</b> fungus in 2000, but is now in danger of disappearing altogether, given the increase in the value of land.|$|E
2500|$|The aman rice {{seasonal}} cultivar (the main winter crop) of 1942 was ravaged, {{though the}} degree of damage {{is a matter of}} debate. [...] Unusually warm, cloudy, and humid climatic conditions and above-average rainfall lasted two months later than average (through November), during critical stages of the rice crop's maturation. This weather pattern triggered [...] "a massive release of disease spores at the exact time that rice plants were most susceptible to infection." [...] The fungus reduced the yield even more than the cyclone. According to , conditions were optimal for <b>brown</b> <b>spot</b> disease, and the resulting outbreak was so destructive that [...] "nothing as devastating ... has been recorded in plant pathological literature." ...|$|E

2500|$|Superficial infections {{increase}} the risk of epidemics. They occur when the bacteria multiply on the epidermis of the host, enter through stomata, or enter through a very shallow wound that does not allow the pathogen to reach the xylem tissue. The host may look like it was rubbed with corn meal or coarse flour but it is actually a series of blisters that me be raised or sunken and appear white to pale orange. The most common leaf symptom is a dark <b>brown</b> <b>spot</b> surrounded by a sort of orange-like area {{on the edge of the}} leaf. Fruits may develop [...] "bird's eye" [...] spotting, which are pale green to white raised pustules that have a brown center and chlorotic halo. Pictures of these symptoms are available at the cited reference.|$|E
2500|$|The western school whiting's {{head and}} upper body are tan above, {{becoming}} paler below with a silvery white belly surface. In life blue, mauve and yellow reflections are common. In larger, albeit unconfirmed, specimens taken at Shark Bay the colour was a golden yellow shade all over, still having the species characteristic banding. There 8 to 11 of these rusty brown to dark brown bars running obliquely {{on the sides}} of the fish, often overlapping a distinct silvery white laterally positioned band. This band begins behind the operculum and continues to the caudal fin base. The spinous dorsal fin [...] is whitish below grading to yellow above, with brown spots and black dusting ly. The second dorsal fin is white basally, becoming lemon yellow above with 3 rows of black blotches forming longitudinal lines across the fin. The anal fin is bright yellow with white margins, the ventrals have a pale yellow center with white margins and the caudal is yellow. The pectoral fin is pale lemon yellow to hyaline with a large round dark brown to bluish <b>brown</b> <b>spot</b> just the base of the fin.|$|E
