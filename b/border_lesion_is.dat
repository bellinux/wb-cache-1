We report a rare case of male breast with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and its imaging features. To our knowledge the imaging appearance of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans of the breast has never {{been reported in the}} literature. Case presentation We report the imaging appearance of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans on the breast of a 41 -year-old Chinese man who initially presented with a palpable lump. A mammogram showed two lesions, one with well circumscribed and the other with an ill defined border, in his right breast. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging was performed and showed the well defined larger lesion with mild central hypointensity while the smaller lesion had an irregular <b>border.</b> Both <b>lesions</b> <b>were</b> well characterized on the fat-suppressed sequences.

However, it should be recognized that there are obvious limitations in these films. These limitations include distortions, magnifications, and difficulties in identifying the re-lationship of the lesions with vital structures. This study presented two cases that indicated the limitations of panoramic radiographs. In the first case, a radiolucent <b>lesion</b> <b>was</b> detected on panoramic radiography. The <b>borders</b> of the <b>lesion</b> <b>were</b> associated with the mandibular canal and mental foremen. In the second case, two radiolucent areas were seen on pano-ramic radiography.

Following the screen-ing panoramic examination, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was obtained in both of the cases. The CBCT views demonstrated no relationship between the lesions and the ana-tomical structures detected in the panoramic radiographs.

40|$|Clinical {{evaluation}} of pigmented skin <b>lesion</b> images <b>is</b> subjective {{and can lead}} to different results depending on the examiner’s experience, also applying semiquantitative methods such as the ABCD rule for dermatoscopy. In order to increase the reproducibility of clinical judgement, a method to automatically reproduce the A (Asymmetry) and the B (Border) parameters of the ABCD rule was developed. One hundred and fourteen images of melanomas acquired by a digital videomicroscope with a 20 x magnification were studied. Clinical evaluation: a clinical judgement of asymmetry of the shape and pigment distribution along 2 axes were performed by 0 – 2 scoring system. For the {{evaluation of}} the border cut-off, a score ranging to 0 from 8 was attributed to each lesion {{on the basis of the}} number of segments with an abrupt edge interruption of the pigmentation. Computer elaboration: after automatic border detection, major and minor axes were obtained and ‘shape asymmetry’ on each axis was calculated considering the proportion of overlapping pixels. A correspondence lower than 90 % was selected as the threshold for asymmetry. The ‘pigment distribution asymmetry’ on each axis was calculated comparing the portion of the dark area, obtained by the median cut algorithm, in the two halves of the lesion. A correspondence lower than 80 % was considered as the threshold for asymmetry. In order to numerically describe the gradient at the <b>border,</b> the <b>lesion</b> <b>border</b> <b>was</b> divided into 8 segments and the change in lightness values along a 30 pixel long segment centered on the <b>lesion</b> <b>border,</b> expressed as the slope of the curve, was considered.

40|$|Abstract Background Dermoscopy {{is one of}} {{the major}} imaging {{modalities}} used in the diagnosis of melanoma and other pigmented skin lesions. In current practice, dermatologists determine lesion area by manually drawing <b>lesion</b> <b>borders.</b> Therefore, automated assessment tools for dermoscopy images have become an important research field mainly because of inter- and intra-observer variations in human interpretation. One of the most important steps in dermoscopy image analysis is automated detection of <b>lesion</b> <b>borders.</b> To our knowledge, in our 2010 study we achieved one of the highest accuracy rates in the automated <b>lesion</b> <b>border</b> detection field by using modified density based clustering algorithm. In the previous study, we proposed a novel method which removes redundant computations in well-known spatial density based clustering algorithm, DBSCAN; thus, in turn it speeds up clustering process considerably. Findings Our previous study was heavily dependent on the pre-processing step which creates a binary image from original image. In this study, we embed a new distance measure to the existing algorithm. This provides twofold benefits. First, since new approach removes pre-processing step, it directly works on color images instead of binary ones. Thus, very important color information is not lost. Second, accuracy of delineated <b>lesion</b> <b>borders</b> <b>is</b> improved on 75 % of 100 dermoscopy image dataset.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in prevalence and volume of ischemic <b>border</b> zone <b>lesions</b> over time in patients with occlusive disease of the ICA after 1 year of follow-up. DESIGN: Follow-up study. SETTING: Referral center. PATIENTS: Fifty-eight patients with an occlusion of the ICA were included.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in prevalence and volume of ischemic <b>lesions</b> <b>were</b> monitored and were correlated with carbon dioxide reactivity at baseline. RESULTS: No significant changes in the prevalence of any infarct types were observed after 1 year of follow-up in the hemispheres ipsilateral or contralateral to the ICA occlusion. However, in hemispheres ipsilateral to an occluded ICA, we found an increase in mean volume of internal border zone infarcts (P =. 002).

In-vivo MR-HIFU ablation was performed 3 - 6 days before excision; RFA was performed in the operation room. Tissue was fixed in formalin and processed to haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and cytokeratin- 8 (CK- 8) -stained slides. Morphology and cell viability were assessed. Ex-vivo ablation resulted in clear morphological changes after RFA versus subtle differences after MR-HIFU. CK- 8 staining was decreased or absent. H&E tended to underestimate the size of thermal damage. In-vivo MR-HIFU resulted in necrotic-like changes. Surprisingly, some ablated <b>lesions</b> <b>were</b> CK- 8 -positive. Histopathology after in-vivo RFA resembled ex-vivo RFA, with hyper-eosinophilic stroma and elongated nuclei. <b>Lesion</b> <b>borders</b> <b>were</b> sharp after MR-HIFU and indistinct after RFA. CONCLUSION: Histopathological differences between MR-HIFU-ablated tissue and RF-ablated tissue were demonstrated. CK- 8 was more reliable for cell viability assessment than H&E when used directly after ablation, while H&E was more reliable in ablated tissue left in situ for a few days. Our results contribute to improved understanding of histopathological features in breast cancer lesions treated with minimally invasive ablative techniques...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Accurate {{detection}} and classification of purely intracortical lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) {{are important in}} understanding their role in disease progression and impact on the clinical manifestations of the disease. However, detection of these lesions with conventional MR imaging remains a challenge. Although double inversion recovery (DIR) {{has been shown to}} improve the sensitivity of the detection of cortical lesions, this sequence has low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), poor delineation of <b>lesion</b> <b>borders,</b> and <b>is</b> prone to image artifacts. We demonstrate that intracortical <b>lesions</b> can <b>be</b> identified and classified with greater confidence by the combination of DIR with phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 16 subjects with MS were included in this study. DIR, PSIR, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images were acquired and inspected by 3 experts, with identification of lesions by consensus. PSIR and DIR images were jointly used to classify lesions as purely intracortical, mixed gray-white matter, and juxtacortical. The difference in the number of lesions detected in each category was compared between combined PSIR and DIR and conventional FLAIR. RESULTS: PSIR consistently allowed a clearer classification and delineation of lesions. Combined PSIR and DIR images showed a 337 % improvement in the total number of lesions detected compared wit...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole and oral prednisolone {{in the treatment of}} ocular toxoplasmosis with zone- 1 posterior pole and peri-papillary lesions. MethodsRetrospective evaluation of records of patients in our tertiary care referral hospitals. Results 22 eyes of 21 patients with active toxoplasma retino-choroiditis in zone - 1 posterior pole and peri-papillary areas were included in the study. One patient developed active lesion in the fellow eye after 6 months which regressed after re-institution of the treatment. There were 11 females and 10 males. Age varied between 18 – 52 (mean age 29 ± 8. 8) years. The follow-up period varied between 4 - 46 (mean 15 ± 11) months. All patients showed resolution of retino-choroiditis and improvement of visual acuity between 1 - 9 lines (mean 4. 18 lines± 2. 3). The mean <b>lesion</b> size pre-treatment <b>was</b> 0. 89 disc diameters± 0. 3 and post-treatment was 0. 70 disc diameters± 0. 28. The mean time taken for the sharpening of <b>lesion</b> <b>borders</b> <b>was</b> 2. 3 ± 0. 4 (range 2 – 3) weeks. No complications reported with the medication. ConclusionThe combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and prednisolone is quite effective in treating the patients with active vision threatening posterior pole and peri-papillary toxoplasmosis lesions...|$|R
40|$|In {{a series}} of more than 200 rabbits in which {{generalized}} <b>lesions</b> <b>were</b> observed following local inoculation with Treponema pallidum, {{there were a number}} of animals in which characteristic <b>lesions</b> <b>were</b> noted upon mucous membranes or along mucocutaneous <b>borders.</b> These <b>lesions</b> <b>were</b> distributed with about equal frequency between the nose or nasolacrimal system and the eyelids on the one hand, and the genital and anal regions on the other. The lips and buccal mucosa appeared to be less subject to localized infections unless the papillomatous growths noted on the lips and under side of the tongue should prove to be in some way connected with such an infection. In many instances, the local reaction was initiated by an acute inflammatory process, and in the case of nasal and genital infections, a definite exudate was formed. The succeeding stages of the reaction consisted in an infiltration of the parts involved, together with a variable degree of proliferation of fixed tissue cells, leading eventually to necrosis and ulceration. The resulting lesions differed according to their location and the character of the reaction in the individual case. Localized infections of the nose occurred in several forms, first, as a rather diffuse affection of the nasal mucosa characterized by the presence of a mucopurulent exudate, second, as a more or less circumscribed process of infiltration with an especial predilection for the region of the anterior nares, and third, as a granulomatous process involving the alæ in particular. Involvement of the nasal mucosa was very commonly associated with lacrimal overflow and with some degree of conjunctivitis. The lesions of the eyelids were usually small, elevated papules or lesions of an ulcerative character some of which were surrounded by a zone of infiltration. In exceptional instances, large granulomatous lesions occurred along the margins of the lower lids. Infection of the penis and sheath gave rise to conditions analogous to those of the nose. In one group of animals, there was a diffuse affection characterized by redness and swelling of the parts with a mucopurulent exudate, in another there were circumscribed or diffuse infiltrations, while in a third the <b>lesions</b> formed <b>were</b> indurated granulomatous masses. Secondary necrosis with erosion or ulceration was a common feature of all these conditions. Localized infections in the region of the anus differed from those in other localities chiefly in the absence of an exudative group of affections and in the frequency with which lesions of a papillomatous type occurred. Lesions of mucous membranes and mucocutaneous borders developed at periods of time varying from a few weeks to several months after inoculation. Most of them were rather enduring and in several instances persisted in an active condition for considerably more than a year...|$|R
