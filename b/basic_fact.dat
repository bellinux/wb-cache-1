25|$|In the United States in 1937, the Marihuana Tax Act was passed, and {{prohibited}} {{the production of}} hemp in addition to cannabis. The reasons that hemp was also included in this law are disputed—several scholars have claimed that the act was passed in order to destroy the US hemp industry, with the primary involvement of businessmen Andrew Mellon, Randolph Hearst, and the Du Pont family. But the improvements of the decorticators, machines that separate the fibers from the hemp stem, could not make hemp fiber a very cheap substitute for fibers from other sources because it could not change that <b>basic</b> <b>fact</b> that strong fibers are only found in the bast, the outer part of the stem. Only about 1/3 of the stem are long and strong fibers. The company DuPont and many industrial historians dispute a link between nylon and hemp. They argue {{that the purpose of}} developing the nylon was to produce a fiber {{that could be used in}} thin stockings for females and compete with silk.|$|E

25|$|After India {{attained}} its {{freedom in}} 1947, Government of India lowered {{to the level}} of a despotic rule during the time of Emergency of 1975. The Emergency was followed after election malpractices allegation and following the verdict against Indira Gandhi. All leaders who spoke against the Emergency rule were jailed or kept in house arrest. It was at this time Yuhanon Marthoma wrote a letter to Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India criticizing emergency and requesting to follow ideals of constitution. There were strong rumors about anticipatory arrest of Yuhanon Marthoma. M.M.Thomas another Marthoma Syrian and theologian advocating Ecumenism of Churches had written many articles on the emergency situation. In spite of criticism from many Christian group, M.M. Thomas made his point in depicting the <b>basic</b> <b>fact</b> of violation of human rights and stressed the need of the democratic organization of the people for the realization of social justice in India. Marthoma Church also passed a resolution against Emergency and for restoration of democracy privately. Marthoma church was also closely associated with the land for the landless and home for the homeless movement much before Acharya Vinoba Bhave initiated Bhoodan movement.|$|E

He summarized the review by saying it was one of her all-time best videos, adding that [...] "there's genuine art to it, which makes it both beautiful to look at and powerful." [...] Montgomery also found that the video was inspired by the Graeae, iamamiwhoami, Kanye West's short film Runaway, the music videos for Robyn's [...] "Indestructible", Madonna's [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] and [...] "Die Another Day", The Matrix franchise, Mortal Kombat, The Rocky Horror Picture Show and the Cam de Leon painting Ocular Orifice, which served as one of several covers of the Tool album Ænima. Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone called it [...] "a total visual assault", and added that it [...] "is a mix of everything we've come to expect from Britney", such as sexy costumes and elaborate choreography. Aaron Parsley of People believed that the fight sequence was the highlight of the video, but dismissed the product placement. Bill Lamb of About.com said the video was visually stellar, although he added that it was [...] "difficult to know" [...] if it would [...] "match the impact of" [...] clips such as [...] "Baby One More Time" [...] and [...] "Toxic". Willa Paskin of New York deemed it as [...] "a high-energy, professional, dance video", but stated that [...] " [...] make up for the <b>basic</b> <b>fact</b> that she isn’t in the dancing shape, or really, performing shape she once was." ...|$|E

If woman as woman grated on him you would suppose that the most womanly details would be the worst for him, but time and again I have known him to have a chair placed for a female so that his desk would not obstruct his view of her legs, and the answer can’t be that his interest is professional and he reads character from legs, because the older and dumpier she is the less he cares where she sits.

60|$|It {{has been}} our fate, among all the innumerable generations of mankind, to face the most frightful {{calamity}} that has ever befallen the world. There is a <b>basic</b> <b>fact</b> which cannot be denied, {{and should not be}} overlooked. For a most important deduction must immediately follow from it. That deduction is that we, who have borne the pains, shall also learn the lesson which they were intended to convey. If we do not learn it and proclaim it, then when can it ever be learned and proclaimed, since there can never again be such a spiritual ploughing and harrowing and preparation for the seed? If our souls, wearied and tortured during these dreadful five years of self-sacrifice and suspense, can show no radical changes, then what souls will ever respond to a fresh influx of heavenly inspiration? In that case the state of the human race would indeed be hopeless, and never in all the coming centuries would there be any prospect of improvement.|$|E
60|$|I {{wondered}} {{what had been}} his private thoughts about himself, his private opinions about life; and when I reflect now upon my lack of real knowledge at five and twenty, I am amazed at the futility of an expensive education which had failed to impress upon me the simple, <b>basic</b> <b>fact</b> that life was struggle; that either development or retrogression is the fate of all men, that characters are never completely made, but always in the making. I had merely a disconcerting glimpse of this truth, with no powers of formulation, as I sat beside my mother in the bedroom, where every article evoked some childhood scene. Here was the dent in the walnut foot-board of the bed made, one wintry day, by the impact of my box of blocks; the big arm-chair, covered with I know not what stiff embroidery, which had served on countless occasions as a chariot driven to victory. I even remembered how every Wednesday morning I had been banished from the room, which had been so large {{a part of my}} childhood universe, when Ella, the housemaid, had flung open all its windows and crowded its furniture into the hall.|$|E
6000|$|The {{origins of}} the middle story, The Secret Sharer, are quite other. It was written much earlier and was {{published}} first in Harper's Magazine, during the early part, I think, of 1911. Or perhaps the latter part? My memory on that point is hazy. The <b>basic</b> <b>fact</b> of the tale I had in my possession for a good many years. It was in truth the common possession of the whole fleet of merchant ships trading to India, China, and Australia: a great company {{the last years of}} which coincided with my first years on the wider seas. The fact itself happened on board a very distinguished member of it, Cutty Sark by name and belonging to Mr. Willis, a notable ship-owner in his day, one of the kind (they are all underground now) who used personally to see his ships start on their voyages to those distant shores where they showed worthily the honoured house-flag of their owner. I am glad I was not too late to get at least one glimpse of Mr. Willis on a very wet and gloomy morning watching from the pier head of the New South Dock one of his clippers starting on a China voyage--an imposing figure of a man under the invariable white hat so well known in the Port of London, waiting till the head of his ship had swung down-stream before giving her a dignified wave of a big gloved hand. For all I know {{it may have been the}} Cutty Sark herself though certainly not on that fatal voyage. I do not know the date of the occurrence on which the scheme of The Secret Sharer is founded; it came to light and even got into newspapers about the middle eighties, though I had heard of it before, as it were privately, among the officers of the great wool fleet in which my first years in deep water were served. It came to light under circumstances dramatic enough, I think, but which have nothing to do with my story. In the more specially maritime part of my writings this bit of presentation may take its place as one of my two Calm-pieces. For, if there is to be any classification by subjects, I have done two Storm-pieces in [...] "The Nigger of the Narcissus" [...] and in [...] "Typhoon"; and two Calm-pieces: this one and [...] "The Shadow-Line," [...] a book which belongs to a later period.|$|E
