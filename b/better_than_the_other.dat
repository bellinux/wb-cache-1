5|$|The misericords {{date from}} 1330 to 1340. They {{may have been}} carved under the {{direction}} of master carpenter John Strode, although his name is not recorded before 1341. He was assisted by Bartholomew Quarter, who is documented from 1343. They originally numbered ninety, of which sixty-five have survived. Sixty-one are installed in the choir, three are displayed in the cathedral and one is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum. New stalls were ordered when the eastern end of the choir was extended in the early 14th century. The canons complained that they had borne the cost of the rebuilding and ordered that the prebendary clerics should pay for their own stalls. When the newly refurbished choir opened in 1339 many misericords were left unfinished, including one-fifth of the surviving 65. Many of the clerics had not paid, and were required to contribute a total sum of £200. The misericords survived <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> sections of the stalls, which, during the Protestant Reformation, had their canopies chopped off and galleries inserted above them. One of the misericords, depicting a boy pulling a thorn from his foot, dates from the 17th century. In 1848 there was a complete rearrangement of the choir furniture, and 61 of the misericords were reused in the restructured stalls.|$|E

25|$|The Jarmann rifle was {{a remarkably}} {{accurate}} rifle for its time. In 1886, the joint Norwegian-Swedish rifle commission, which had selected the Jarmann, created {{a list of}} the ballistic properties of all the rifles tested. It is clear from the list, reproduced below, that the Jarmann M1884 was significantly <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> rifles tested, although in part this must be due to the higher muzzle velocity of the Jarmann.|$|E

25|$|Commander Alexander McVicar (or M'Vicar) was {{appointed}} to Apelles on 8 March, and recommissioned her that month for the North Sea. McVicar tested a new patent compass in July and wrote a testimonial letter on 13 June. Vice-Admiral Robert Otway had ordered him to test the compass belonging to Mr. Alexander, of Leith, and McVicar used it for some nine weeks, finding it <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> compasses on Apelles. It was quick to come on point and held its direction in heavy seas and despite shocks such as guns firing or seas striking.|$|E
25|$|Anomic aphasia is the {{inability}} to recall words and names and is a common symptom of patients with Aphasia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research has been conducted {{to find out how}} these particular diseases affect TOTs in these individuals. In a study by Beeson, Holland, and Murray (1997), participants with Alzheimer's disease and three classic aphasic syndromes (Broca’s, anomic, and conduction aphasia) were instructed to name famous people. Those with anomic aphasia showed to be superior to the other groups in their ability to naming famous people that were presented. This finding was expected as the group has relatively mild aphasia. However, the Broca’s conduction and AD groups did not differ in immediate or delayed naming of famous faces. All of the groups provided some basic identifying semantic information for {{at least half of the}} items presented, suggesting a fair number of items potentially in TOT. Conduction and Broca’s groups showed strongest evidence of TOT, performing <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> groups in identification of initial letters.|$|E
25|$|Another type of device {{people use}} {{to help their}} recall memory become {{efficient}} chunking. Chunking {{is the process of}} breaking down numbers into smaller units to remember the information or data, this helps recall numbers and math facts. An example of this chunking process is a telephone number; this is chunked with three digits, three digits, then four digits. People read them off as such when reciting a phone number to another person. There has been research done about these techniques and an institution tested two groups of people to see if these types of devices work well for real people, the results came back determining a significant performance difference between the group who did not use cognitive strategies and the group who did. The group using the techniques immediately performed <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> group and when taking a pre-test and post-test the results indicated that the group using the techniques improved while the other group did not.|$|E

GamePro readers chose Gold {{as the second}} best fighting game of 1996 after Tekken2. Next Generation and Marcus Hawkins (N64 Magazine) agreed that Tekken2 and Virtua Fighter2 had outclassed Killer Instinct Gold. N64 concluded {{that even in the}} Nintendo64's then-meager catalog of titles, Killer Instinct Gold did not distinguish itself, and thus had a lifespan of [...] "weeks rather than months". Killer Instinct Gold waned from a celebrated announcement to a quiet European release.|$|E
500|$|People {{connected}} with the band were impressed by the record. Ivo Watts-Russell recalled: [...] "I remember when I first heard Surfer Rosa thinking, 'I didn't know the Pixies could sound like The Fall.' That was my immediate reaction, in other words, incredibly raw." [...] Gary Smith, {{who at the time}} was in a disagreement with the band, admitted he [...] "was really happy that they had made such a forceful, aggressive, record." [...] Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis, comparing the record to the later Pixies albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde, said he thought that Steve Albini's production [...] "sounded way <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> ones." ...|$|E

500|$|From {{contemporary}} reviews, Howard Thompson of The New York Times gave a brief negative {{review of}} Danger: Diabolik {{referring to the}} film as [...] "infantile junk." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a {{two and a half}} star rating out of four, stating that he felt it was <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Dino De Laurentiis production Barbarella, but that it was [...] "long and eventually loses track of itself." [...] Variety gave the film a negative review, calling it a [...] "dull Dino De Laurentiis programmer" [...] whose [...] "izarre sets, poor process work, static writing and limp direction spell pure formula fare for lowercase grind bookings." [...] The Monthly Film Bulletin gave the film a positive review, noting that: [...] "Bava's superb visual sense stands him in good stead in this comic-strip adventure which looks like a brilliant pastiche of the best of everything in anything from James Bond to Matt Helm." ...|$|E

[...] After he spends {{some time in the}} house they decide [...] "he's way <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> one". [...] There is a resemblance between Ed and Mrs Backman, and it is revealed they were twins separated at birth. [...] While at church, the Backman children are kidnapped by stone aliens and are saved by Frankenstein's monster, who brings them to Washington, D.C. where they find their kidnapped real father. [...] Josie and Ed's zombie friend rescues the Backmans. [...] Ed has his clown makeup restored and reverts to his cheerful self. [...] When he goes to visit Josie, he learns her apartment building has burned down, and she was the only casualty. [...] Her charred skeleton is brought out, clutching an unburnt severed hand.|$|E

While it is not {{established}} that this transaction related to the Eighth, the Sibelius scholar Kari Kilpeläinen points out {{that none of the}} earlier symphony scores carry the unnumbered heading [...] "Symphonie", and asks: [...] "Could he have omitted the number to prevent news of the now completed Eighth from spreading? Or did he not give the work a number at all, because he was not satisfied with it?" [...] The composer's daughter Katarina spoke of the self-doubt that afflicted her father at this time, aggravated by the continuing expectations and fuss that surrounded the Eighth Symphony. [...] "He wanted it to be <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> symphonies. Finally it became a burden, even though so much of it had already been written down. In the end I don't know whether he would have accepted what he had written." ...|$|E

500|$|Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian {{said that}} before Guetta's collaborations with Kelis ("Acapella") and Rowland, she felt [...] " [...] was ruining R by turning all of my {{favorite}} ladies into Euro cheesemongers". However [...] "Acapella" [...] changed Nicholson's mind and she said, [...] "'Commander' is further evidence of this". Whilst Fraser McAlpine awarded the song four stars, his review was neither positive nor negative. He said [...] "Singers always like to sing about how brilliantly attractive and astonishing (and bossy) they are. Even if the words have a double meaning, which hints that they are merely mouthing the self-regard of a rampant egomaniac, who is laughing and rubbing his hands every time they start to sing, they don't mind. Why would they? The song mentions hair, and being <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> ladies. That's what singers live for. [...] one extra star for the stoopid grammar switcheroo ... because of the chorus, which rules." [...] Gavin Martin of The Mirror made similar comments neither praising nor criticizing the song, instead saying it will put her [...] "firmly {{in control of the}} dance floor". Entertainment Weekly named it [...] "the number one summer jam of the year" [...] whilst music station KISS 100 called it fabulous and made it their song of the week for the week beginning May 24, 2010. A reviewer from the network said, [...] "Commander is another smash ... Kelly's taking command! With glamour set to max and drama cranked up to full power 'Commander' is proof that Kelly means business!" [...] In Fitness magazine's 100best workout songs, [...] "Commander" [...] was named one of the ten best dance workout songs for its bouncy 125beats per minute composition.|$|E
500|$|... "Weight Gain 4000" [...] {{introduced}} several {{characters who}} would maintain important recurring roles {{throughout the rest}} of the series. Among them were Jimbo Kern, Mayor McDaniels, and Wendy's best friend Bebe Stevens. It also introduces Clyde Donovan, a student from Mr. Garrison's class who would eventually play significant roles in future seasons, although he was not identified by name. The characters demonstrate the wide range of often-extreme personalities among the adult residents of South Park, as well as serving as individual satires. McDaniels, who imagines herself an instant star upon being seen on television with Gifford, is portrayed as more caring about her own fame than the needs of her constituents, and the neglect with which Jimbo sells a gun to an obviously unstable Mr. Garrison serves as a satire of gun control. Jimbo and his friend Ned (who was not introduced until [...] "Volcano") were inspired by caricatures Parker used to draw during high school. In creating McDaniels, Parker and Stone envisioned a sophisticated mayor who was convinced she was <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> residents of South Park. The episode also marked the first reference to Jesus and Pals, the public-access television talk show hosted by Jesus Christ. The fictional show is mentioned twice in the background during commercials on television sets, although footage from the show itself is not shown until [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride" [...] later in the season. Jesus and Pals, and the idea of Jesus as a South Park resident, are references to the original The Spirit of Christmas cartoon. Debbie Liebling, who served as a South Park producer at the time of the episode's broadcast, said the inclusion of a television show hosted by Jesus helped convey for audiences the idea of South Park as a place where [...] "anything can happen".|$|E

Some of these, such as meditations on [...] "Common Sense", [...] "Originality", [...] "The Ideal", [...] "Envy", and [...] "Prejudice", appeared in The Atlas in early 1830. At some point in this period he summarised the spirit and method of his life's work as a philosopher, which he had never ceased to consider himself to be; but [...] "The Spirit of Philosophy" [...] was not published in his lifetime.

2500|$|In general, blood damage affects valves in {{both the}} mitral and aortic positions. [...] High {{stresses}} during leakage flow in aortal valves result from higher transvalvular pressures, and high stresses occur during forward flow for mitral valves. [...] Valvular thrombosis is most common in mitral prosthetics. [...] The caged-ball model is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two models in terms of controlling this problem, because it is at a lower risk for thrombosis and it is gradual when it does happen. [...] The bileaflet is more adaptable to this problem than the tilting-disc model because if one leaflet stops working, the other can still function. [...] However, if the hinge is blocked, both leaflets will stop functioning.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere {{has been}} active work to extend the Prolog style Horn clause logic {{programming}} to non-Horn clauses. In this paper, we analyze and compare several such extensions using an analytical approach. All the extensions discussed behave exactly like Prolog when only Horn clauses are involved. The purpose is to understand the computational complexity of these inference systems when non-Horn clauses are present. The analyses do not necessarily prove that any one system is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> all <b>the</b> time. But they do suggest when one system may be <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> for some particular kind of problems. They also help to discover some interesting properties of some extensions and suggest a possible syntactic transformation on problems to improve the performance of some extensions...|$|R
