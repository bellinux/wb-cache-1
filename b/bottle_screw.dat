50|$|Compared to cork, {{screw caps}} reduce the wine faults of {{oxidation}} and of cork taint, {{although it is}} possible to find TCA contamination in a screw cap <b>bottle.</b> <b>Screw</b> caps are generally perceived as easier to open. Screw caps have a much lower failure rate than cork, and in theory will allow a wine to reach the customer in perfect condition, with a minimum of bottle variation. However, cork has a centuries-old tradition behind it, and there are also concerns about the impact of screw caps on the aging of those few wines that require decades to be at their best. Some argue that the slow ingress of oxygen plays a vital role in aging a wine, while others argue that this amount is almost zero in a sound cork and that any admitted oxygen is harmful.|$|E
50|$|To filter the water, one puts {{contaminated}} {{water in the}} back of the <b>bottle,</b> then <b>screws</b> the lid on. The lid has a built in pump which is operated manually with a hand; the pumping action forces the {{contaminated water}} through the nano-filter and safe drinking water collects in another chamber in the bottle. The drinker then opens the top of the bottle from which safe drinking water comes out.|$|R

5000|$|Oronamin C was {{introduced}} in February 1965 and was initially sold in a 120 ml glass bottle sealed with a bottle cap. It contains isoleucine and many other essential amino acids {{as well as many}} vitamins such as vitamin B2, vitamin B6 and vitamin C. It is not only available in supermarkets and convenience stores in Japan, but also in Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. vending machines as well. The bottle cap was briefly replaced with a <b>screw</b> <b>bottle</b> cap, but following a nationwide scare during the 1980s regarding a large number of poisoned sealed <b>bottled</b> beverages, this <b>screw</b> cap was replaced with a one-time [...] "pull-cap," [...] which cannot be re-sealed after opening. Child welfare activist Osamu Mizutani (水谷 修 Mizutani Osamu, born May 8, 1956) wrote that the previous screw caps allowed individuals to put in paint thinner and then re-seal the bottles.|$|R
40|$|A {{convenient}} and effective sample bottle {{system based on}} simple modifications of disposable plastic syringes and bottles has been devised and tested for slurry samples. Syringe/ bottle hybrids (hereafter referred to as syringe bottles) have the convenience of regular flat-bottom <b>bottles</b> with <b>screw</b> cap closures. In addition, the syringe imparts a sliding and adjustable bottom to the bottle that forces the entire contents from the bottle. The system was designed especially to collect samples for high temperature work-ups of DWPF slurry samples. The syringe bottles together with fixed-bottom sample vial inserts would provide the DWPF with {{convenient and}} reliable methods for dealing with slurry samples...|$|R

5000|$|It {{takes time}} for the {{dissolved}} CO2 {{to come out of}} solution, in the form of gas bubbles that grow and bubble up within the liquid. Thus if the cap is replaced quickly after opening, an intermediate equilibrium state can be maintained, with CO2 previously dissolved in the liquid instead occupying the headspace. However, the CO2 partial pressure only ever decreases on each opening, as more of the gas escapes from the bottle entirely. The Fizz Keeper does not cause that partial pressure to increase significantly. [...] Rohrig also observes from experiment that the Fizz Keeper forms a poorer seal than the <b>bottle's</b> own <b>screw</b> cap, thus allowing CO2 to leak out, and the CO2 partial pressure to decrease, more quickly with the Fizz Keeper on a bottle than with the normal cap.|$|R

40|$|Preservation of {{germplasm}} collections {{with low}} temperature storage is problematic because of power failures and equipment breakdown. Low moisture storage {{is an alternative}} to low temperature storage for medium-term germplasm conservation of seeds of most crops. Seed drying using silica gel for medium-term storage of bean seed was investigated. Seeds of two bean cultivars were dried for 50 days with silica gel in a desiccator experiment using a gel to seed ratio of 1 : 2. The final moisture content was 6. 1 and 6. 6 percent for the two cultivars. Dry seeds were stored in recycled glass soda <b>bottles</b> with <b>screw</b> caps sealed with candle wax at 25 degrees C for one year. The seed moisture content remained constant confirming that recycled glass soda bottles {{can be used as}} inexpensive seed storage containers. Germination rates after one year of storage were 97. 5 and 100 percent for the two cultivars. It is expected that the seed can be kept in glass bottles for 10 - 20 years (mid-term storage). In order to dry larger amounts of seed, a drying facility using silica gel in an air-tight PVC drum was developed. Procedures were developed for collection, characterization and maintenance of bean germplasm collections, as well as for data management...|$|R
30|$|A dense {{sampling}} {{campaign was}} undertaken {{at the peak}} of the dry season (January 2012) during which 72 water samples were collected from over 13 communities (Fig.  1). These included 32 open wells and 14 ‘boreholes’ hereafter termed groundwater, 14 streams, 4 rivers, 5 dam waters, and 3 lakes (Lakes Bambili, Oku and Ber) hereafter called surface water. Surface water sources were collected under base flow conditions (no run-off influence) since the sampling was in the dry season. The locations and altitudes of the selected sampling points were identified in the field using a Garmin Vista CX GPS. New narrow mouth low-density polyethylene bottles (100  ml) and Duran glass bottles (500  ml) were used for stable isotopes and tritium (3 H) water sampling, respectively. The glass <b>bottles</b> contained <b>screw</b> caps bonded with polytetrafluoroethylene-coated silicone seal liners. In order to avoid contamination, the bottles were properly rinsed with distilled water and dried in the Laboratory. Further details on water sampling are described in Wirmvem (2014). Unfiltered samples from 8 selected ‘boreholes’ (representing the entire study area) were pumped into the glass bottles using a peristaltic pump. The samples were properly capped immediately after sampling and well-preserved in a cooler container containing ice blocks prior to air-flight to Japan for analyses.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Natural corks {{have long}} been used as wine closures. However, they are {{associated}} with causing multiple adverse effects to the wine they are attempting to preserve. Alternative closures such as synthetic corks and screw caps were developed {{in order to reduce}} and/or eliminate these problems. However, the major cause of concern regarding these closures is of consumers' acceptance. The effect of how three types of closures (Natural Cork, Synthetic Cork and Screw Cap) affected wine consumers' perceptions of the quality of wine was examined in this study. This project was divided into two experiments. The first experiment determined if frequent wine consumers could detect sensorial differences between the three closure types. The second experiment ascertained if and how regular wine consumers' perceptions were altered based on the type of closure with which the wine samples were bottled. It was determined that the wine consumers could not significantly detect a difference between any of the three closure type samples based only on sensory stimuli. The results from the second experiment found for the Chardonnay samples, the knowledge that the wine samples came from a natural cork or a synthetic cork did not significantly affect the liking, quality or purchase intent scores. However, when the panelists knew that the sample was <b>bottled</b> with a <b>screw</b> cap, they thought it was of lower quality, were less willing to buy a wine like the sample and they lowered the price they were willing to pay. For the Merlot samples, knowledge that the sample came from a natural cork caused the wine consumers to significantly increase both their opinions {{of the quality of the}} wine and the amount they were willing to pay for the wine. When they knew that the sample was <b>bottled</b> with a <b>screw</b> cap, they reduced the price they would pay for the wine...|$|R
40|$|Dangerous {{volatile}} organic compounds, or VOCs, can accumulate as {{indoor air pollution}} within homes causing health problems in the habitants. In {{order to determine the}} concentration of VOCs in such areas a field-deployable sampler is necessary. The focus of this work has been to develop an inexpensive, reusable, sensitive fielddeployable passive sampler for monitoring VOCs in indoor air. We have devised a sampler that uses polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which is a common inexpensive, nonpolar adsorbent. The sampler is comprised of an aluminum bottle coated with the PDMS. In operation, the coated portion is exposed to the air to be sampled. The <b>bottle</b> is then <b>screwed</b> into the top portion which keeps the material sealed-in. The sample from the aluminum bottle is then transferred to the GC for analysis using a Gas Phase Sampling Device (GSPID). In this work, sample equilibration time (in the bottle), GSPID gas flow rate and the sample loop filling timeswere optimized. Solutions containing toluene, ethylbenzene, and o-xylene were used as representatives for common household VOCs. Butanone was used as an internal standard in order to control reproducibility...|$|R

40|$|Autonomous {{learning}} of object manipulation skills can enable robots to acquire rich behavioral repertoires that scale to {{the variety of}} objects found in the real world. However, current motion skill learning methods typically restrict the behavior to a compact, low-dimensional representation, limiting its expressiveness and generality. In this paper, we extend a recently developed policy search method la-lnnpg- 14 {{and use it to}} learn a range of dynamic manipulation behaviors with highly general policy representations, without using known models or example demonstrations. Our approach learns a set of trajectories for the desired motion skill by using iteratively refitted time-varying linear models, and then unifies these trajectories into a single control policy that can generalize to new situations. To enable this method to run on a real robot, we introduce several improvements that reduce the sample count and automate parameter selection. We show that our method can acquire fast, fluent behaviors after only minutes of interaction time, and can learn robust controllers for complex tasks, including putting together a toy airplane, stacking tight-fitting lego blocks, placing wooden rings onto tight-fitting pegs, inserting a shoe tree into a shoe, and <b>screwing</b> <b>bottle</b> caps onto bottles...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{aluminum}} beverage <b>bottles</b> having <b>screw</b> tops {{with opening}} diameters of 28 and 38 mm have been {{launched in the}} Japanese market {{in keeping with the}} modern-day drinking habits of consumers. Although Japanese consumers are familiar with such bottles, a majority of them feel that the 28 mm opening is too small and the 38 mm opening is too large. Therefore, we felt the need to develop a method for evaluating consumer feelings when they drink a beverage directly from the bottle opening. For this purpose, we propose an evaluation function of drinking ease that calculates the optimum opening diameter of the bottle. From results of our previous study, we know that there exists an ideal volume of beverage flowing into the mouth, at which consumers feel most comfortable while drinking directly from bottles. Therefore, we define the evaluation function of drinking ease in terms of the difference between the actual volume of fluid in the mouth and the expected ideal volume. If this difference is small, consumers probably feel comfortable while drinking the beverage. We consider a design variable, i. e., the opening diameter, and two state variables, i. e., the volume of beverage remaining in the bottle and the height of consumers, and construct the response surface of the evaluation function by using radial basis function networks. In addition, for investigating the influence of beverage type on the evaluation function, we select green tea and a carbonated beverage (Coke) as test beverages. Results of optimization of the proposed function show that when the opening diameters are 35. 4 mm and 34. 4 mm in the case of green tea and Coke, respectively, the actual volume of fluid in the mouth is closest to the ideal volume and the participants feel most comfortable. These results are in agreement with results of our previous study that an opening diameter of 33 mm is optimum for young Japanese adults. Thus, we confirm that the proposed function is accurate; {{it can be used to}} design bottle openings to suit consumers of various age groups and types of beverages. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society...|$|R
40|$|Aluminum {{beverage}} <b>bottles</b> with a <b>screw</b> top of 28 -mm and 38 -mm {{in diameter}} have been launched {{on to the}} Japanese market recent years to meet new drinking custom trend of the consumers. However, some Japanese customers feel that the 28 -mm opening is too small and also feel that the 38 -mm opening is too large. Therefore, it is desired to develop a method to evaluate human feelings when drinking directly from the bottle opening and to identify the opening size that is best for consumers' drinking ease. Hence, we proposed an evaluation function of drinking ease {{in order to identify}} the rigorous dimension of bottle opening. The evaluation function of drinking ease has been proposed in terms of the difference between the actual flow amount from the bottles and the appropriate flow amount. If the difference decrease, the consumers possibly feel comfortable. Three variables (the bottle opening size, the beverage amount in the bottles, and the height of subjects) have been considered and the evaluation function of drinking ease has been constructed using Radial Basis Function Network. Results from the optimization of the proposed function, the subjects may get the closest beverage amount to the appropriate amount and feel comfortable when they drink from the 34. 3 -mm opening.

40|$|If {{you have}} {{experience}} with planting young trees, {{you will know}} that {{the best time for}} planting is {{a few weeks before the}} rainy season starts. Young trees usually develop deeper root systems if the soil is relatively dry and the water table is low. Growth is then sturdier; in addition, trees with deep root systems are more drought-resistant than trees planted in damp soil. The problem is to keep your trees alive in the dry period preceding the rains. According to Dee Raymer from Machakos, Kenya, there are many possible solutions: however, none is ideal. One of the better known is the method of the inverted bottle in the soil, close to the roots. It is quite effective but refilling is a tedious job and sometimes the bottlenecks get clogged with soil. In Ecoforum 22 - 1, Daymer presents a method, which is a combination of different techniques. Dig a planting hole about half a metre deep and wide and line it with a single layer of newspaper. Fill it with alternate layers of organic matter and soil (see drawing). Organic matter is made by mixing manure, organic kitchen wastes, some compost, and a handful of bonemeal. Bonemeal is a good slow release fertiliser, which stimulates root development. Each layer should be damped. Make four small holes with a hot needle in the bottom of the plastic bottle. The bottle is placed next to the tree, slightly off the centre of the hole. The neck of the <b>bottle</b> with a <b>screw</b> cap! should rise just above ground level. Place the root ball remove planting bags in the centre of the hole in a layer of organic matter. Fill the rest of the hole and apply 1 litre of water across the hole. Then cover the hole with a double layer of newspaper. On top of that apply dry soil covered with a thick layer of organic mulch. That layer is overlaid by stones to shade the soil and reduce daytime soil temperatures. The amount of water released by the bottle is regulated by the tightness of the cap. Unscrewing the cap for ten seconds every day makes a little water go a very long way!
