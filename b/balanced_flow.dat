The current best time bound for computing <b>balanced</b> <b>flows</b> in such networks requires $O(n) $ maxflow computations, where $n$ {{is the number}} of nodes in the network [Devanur et al. 2008]. Our algorithm requires only a single parametric flow computation. The best algorithm for computing parametric flows [Gallo et al. 1989] is only by a logarithmic factor slower than the best algorithms for computing maxflows. Hence, the running time of the algorithms in [Devanur et al. 2008] and [Duan and Mehlhorn 2015] for computing market equilibria in linear Fisher and Arrow-Debreu markets improve by almost a factor of $n$.

40|$|<b>Balanced</b> <b>flow</b> meters are recent {{additions}} to an established class of simple, rugged flow meters that contain no moving parts {{in contact with}} flow and are based on measurement of pressure drops across objects placed in flow paths. These flow meters are highly accurate, minimally intrusive, easily manufacturable, and reliable. A <b>balanced</b> <b>flow</b> meter can be easily mounted in a flow path by bolting it between conventional pipe flanges. A <b>balanced</b> <b>flow</b> meter {{can be used to}} measure the flow of any of a variety of liquids or gases, provided that it has been properly calibrated. Relative to the standard orifice-plate flow meter, the <b>balanced</b> <b>flow</b> meter introduces less turbulence and two times less permanent pressure loss and is therefore capable of offering 10 times greater accuracy and repeatability with less dissipation of energy. A secondary benefit of the reduction of turbulence is the reduction of vibration and up to 15 times less acoustic noise generation. Both the <b>balanced</b> <b>flow</b> meter and the standard orifice-plate flow meter are basically disks that contain holes and are instrumented with pressure transducers on their upstream and downstream faces. The most obvious difference between them is that the standard orifice plate contains a single, central hole while the <b>balanced</b> <b>flow</b> meter contains multiple holes. The term 'balanced' signifies that in designing the meter, the sizes and locations of the holes are determined in an optimization procedure that involves balancing of numerous factors, including volumetric flow, mass flow, dynamic pressure, kinetic energy, all in an effort to minimize such undesired effects as turbulence, pressure loss, dissipation of kinetic energy, and non-repeatability and nonlinearity of response over the anticipated range of flow conditions. Due to proper balancing of these factors, recent testing demonstrated that the balanced flow-meter performance was similar to a Venturi tube in both accuracy and pressure recovery, but featured reduced cost and pipe-length requirements...|$|E
40|$|The global ocean thermohaline {{circulation}} is partly {{composed of the}} sinking of dense surface waters at high latitudes. But in order to close the circulation and maintain the abyssal stratification, the dense waters must rise up again through vertical mixing. This process requires a source of energy roughly estimated to be 2 TW. Previous work has concluded that tides and winds may adequately supply the required power, but the conceivable role of loss of balance from mesoscale eddies, resulting in the generation of internal inertia-gravity waves and associated vertical mixing, has hitherto been considered to be “of unknown importance ” (Wunsch and Ferrari, 2004). We investigate the potential role of loss of balance, by studying the generation of internal inertia-gravity waves by <b>balanced</b> <b>flow</b> in a rotating two-layer annulus laboratory experiment (Williams et al., 2008). As the Rossby number of the <b>balanced</b> <b>flow</b> decreases, the amplitude of the emitted inertia-gravity waves also decreases, but much less rapidly than is predicted by several dynamical theories.

40|$|Revolutionary new {{technology}} that creates balanced conditions {{across the face of}} a multi-hole orifice plate has been developed, patented and exclusively licensed for commercialization. This <b>balanced</b> <b>flow</b> technology simultaneously measures mass flow rate, volumetric flow rate, and fluid density with little or no straight pipe run requirements. Initially, the balanced plate was a drop in replacement for a traditional orifice plate, but testing revealed substantially better performance as compared to the orifice plate such as, 10 times better accuracy, 2 times faster (shorter distance) pressure recovery, 15 times less acoustic noise energy generation, and 2. 5 times less permanent pressure loss. During 2004 testing at MSFC, testing revealed several configurations of the <b>balanced</b> <b>flow</b> meter that match the accuracy of Venturi meters while having only slightly more permanent pressure loss. However, the balanced meter only requires a 0. 25 inch plate and has no upstream or downstream straight pipe requirements. As a fluid conditioning device, the fluid usually reaches fully developed flow within 1 pipe diameter of the balanced conditioning plate.

The experiment is observed to contain short, fast inertia–gravity waves in addition to the large-scale, slowly evolving <b>balanced</b> <b>flow.</b> The laboratory experiments are compared to numerical simulations made using a quasi-geostrophic model.
