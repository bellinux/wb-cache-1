40|$|The {{human hand}} {{is an amazing}} tool. It {{is one of the}} most {{important}} interface between us and the world by allowing us to touch and manipulate it. Its complexity is certainly similar to its usefulness. To control the manipulatory and the exploratory functions of the hand, the brain needs to collect, to store, and to process adequately a considerable quantity of data about the objects and the environment. When gripping an object with the index finger and the thumb only, all this information is used to control the kinematics and the dynamics of the movement. In some situations, we have to manipulate unbalanced objects that produce <b>load</b> <b>torques</b> at the finger/object interface. The objective of the present work was to further investigate the control strategies during object manipulation in presence of <b>load</b> <b>torques.</b> The results show that the grip force adaptation is slowed down when a <b>load</b> <b>torque</b> is present. The reproduction of a slower adaptation when manipulating torques under microgravity suggests that the presence of <b>load</b> <b>torques</b> experienced during movement may alter our internal estimates of required grip force. The last hypothesis tested was that the difference in control strategies when a <b>load</b> <b>torque</b> is present comes from a poor ability to discriminate <b>load</b> <b>torques.</b> Indeed, a poor ability to discriminate <b>load</b> <b>torque</b> was found during the active task. However, this bad discrimination was not due to an incapacity of the sensory system as the discrimination during the passive stimulation was much better.

As a matter of fact, this method is meant to inter-connect a speed estimator with the <b>load</b> <b>torque</b> observer. For this purpose, a MRAS {{has been applied to}} estimate the rotor speed with tuned <b>load</b> <b>torque</b> in order to obtain a high performance ISFOC induction motor drive. The reference and adjustable models, developed in the stationary stator reference frame, are used in the MRAS scheme in an attempt to estimate the speed of the measured terminal voltages and currents.

The system {{is applied to the}} <b>load</b> <b>torque</b> on a rudder in a real-time hardware-in-the-loop system (HILS). Compared with the traditional loading method, in which unavoidable additional torque exists, the variable stiffness loading system employs a “first decomposed and then coupled” approach to output the <b>load</b> <b>torque</b> and to significantly reduce the additional torque. Based on experimental data obtained from a wind tunnel test, a calculation method is proposed to determine the loading parameters of the variable stiffness loading system.

40|$|This {{research}} presents techniques {{developed for}} non-intrusive sensing and fault detection in reciprocating compressors driven by induction motors. These procedures are “non-intrusive” because they rely only on {{voltage and current}} signals measured on the compressor power cable. The electrical sensor based method allows for easy and non-intrusive determination of many fault sensitive signals that usually require complicated, expensive, and time consuming operations to measure. The electric signals are processed and used with the inverted dynamic motor model equations and motor parameters (which are also determined non-intrusively) to recover the instantaneous angular speed of the compressor shaft, {{as well as the}} torque of electromagnetic origin provided by the motor. These two intermediate signals and compressor parameters such as crank shaft inertia are then used to solve for the compressor <b>load</b> <b>torque.</b> This <b>load</b> <b>torque</b> signal has high fault diagnostic value because it is composed of pressure and friction torques, and these signals are close to mechanical phenomena of diagnostic interest in the compressor.
