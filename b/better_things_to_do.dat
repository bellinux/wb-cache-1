500|$|At {{the time}} of its initial release, Don't Look Now was {{generally}} well received by critics, although some criticised it for being [...] "arty and mechanical". Jay Cocks for Time, wrote that [...] "Don't Look Now is such a rich, complex and subtle experience that it demands more than one viewing", while Variety commented that the film's visual flourishes made it [...] "much more than merely a well-made psycho-horror thriller". Pauline Kael writing for The New Yorker was more reserved in her praise, considering the film to be [...] "the fanciest, most carefully assembled enigma yet put on the screen" [...] but that there was a [...] "distasteful clamminess about the picture", while Gordon Gow of Films and Filming felt that it fell short of the aspirations of Nicolas Roeg's previous two films, Performance and Walkabout, but it was nevertheless a thriller of some depth. Vincent Canby, reviewer for The New York Times, on the other hand, criticised the film for a lack of suspense which he put down to a twist that comes halfway through rather than at the end, and at which point it [...] "stops being suspenseful and becomes an elegant travelogue that treats us to second-sightseeing in Venice". Canby also suggested that second sight was not convincing on screen, since it appeared simply like flash-forward which is a standard story-telling device in films, and concluded that [...] "Not only do you probably have <b>better</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but so, I'm sure, do most of the people connected with the film." ...|$|E

Dio, who had read Sir Walter Scott, Arthurian tales, and science fiction growing up, had previously used fantasy lyrics in his early 1970s band Elf. Dio explained to an interviewer that influenced by his youthful reading, [...] "When I became a songwriter, I thought what <b>better</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> than do what {{no one else is}} doing...to tell fantasy tales.

By a campfire that night, Elam wonders what would happen if he owned a white woman, had a son by her, and educated the boy just enough that he {{considered}} himself different from his fellow white slaves. Reflecting on his own life, Elam concludes that, in truth, the boy wouldn't be different at all. Cullen tells Elam he freed his own slaves before the war to please his wife, realizing only later that she was right <b>to</b> make him <b>do</b> so. Following her murder, his barn was set on fire. The slave woman, who raised Cullen, died inside the barn trying to shield his son from the flames. The next morning, Cullen teaches Elam to shoot a gun. Elam misses all the targets. Cullen explains that the <b>better</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is <b>to</b> count the rounds and make sure his opponent has to reload his weapon first.|$|R

It is a theory that will stand {{in stark contrast to}} the tendentious and normative welfare economics that now dominates the policy dialogue in applied economics. In this standard approach, economists place “…exclusive reliance on individual utilities to judge social goodness and right actions [Sen 1993, p. 521]. ” The commitment to welfarism has become the basis for truth claims regarding definitions of the good and of the <b>better</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> When public decision makers find sufficient reasons to ignore the policy prescriptions of applied economists they are often denounced for taking actions that are inefficient, politically motivated, irrational, and not in the public interest [Arrow, et al., 1996; Palmer, Oates, and Portney, 1995]. We see here a conflict between the way applied economists believe public policy ought to be considered and implemented, and the way in which public policy is in fact considered and implemented. Who is right? Do applied economists bring abiding truth to public policy through the application of consequentialist welfarism? Are the truth claims of economists of sufficient authority and disciplinary legitimacy that they provid...|$|R

The buds are bursting and the birds are calling, my friends. You may find <b>better</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the sunlight than listening to the stories of an old, broken soldier.

60|$|Again, {{in other}} of your classes, in Chemistry, in Astronomy, in Natural History, besides {{acquiring}} groups of facts, {{the student has}} {{a glimpse of the}} method by which they were discovered, of the type of inference to which the discovery conforms, so that the discovery of a new comet, the detection of a new species, the invention of a new chemical compound, each becomes a lesson of the most beautiful and impressive kind in the art of reasoning. And it would be superfluous and impertinent for me here to point out how valuable such lessons are in the way of mental discipline, apart from the fruit they bear in other ways. But here again the relation to the judgments we have to form in the moral, political, practical sphere, is too remote and too indirect. The judgments, in this region, of the most brilliant and successful explorers in physical science, seem to be exactly as liable to every kind of fallacy as those of other people. The application of scientific method and conception to society is yet in its infancy, and the Novum Organum or the Principia of moral and social phenomena will perhaps not be wholly disclosed to any of us now alive. In any case it is clear that for the purposes of such an institution as this, if the rules of evidence and proof and all the other safeguards for making your propositions true and relevant, are to be taught at all, they must be taught not only in an elementary form, but with illustrations that shall convey their own direct reference and application to practical life. If everybody could find time to master Mill's Logic or so instructive and interesting a book as Professor Jevons's Principles of Science, a certain number at any rate of the bad mental habits of people would be cured; and for those of you here who have leisure enough, and want to find a worthy keystone of your culture, it would be hard <b>to</b> find a <b>better</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{for the next six months}} than to work through one or both of the books I have just named--pen in hand. The ordinary text-books of formal logic <b>do</b> not seem <b>to</b> meet the special aim which I am now trying to impress as desirable--namely, the habit of valuing, not merely speculative nor scientific truth, but the truth of practical life; a practising of the intellect in forming and expressing the opinions and judgments that form the staple of our daily discourse.|$|R

His appearance on Saturdays was always military, by reason of the route march of his Volunteer Corps in the afternoon. Gentleman Fox, who belonged to the corps too, was also looking square; but that commercial traveller on his other side seemed more louche, and as if surprised in immorality, than ever; only the proximity of Gentleman Fox {{on the other side}} kept Mr. Bosengate from shrinking. Then he saw the prisoner being brought in, shadowy and dark behind the brightness of his buttons, and he experienced a sort of shock, this figure was so exactly that which had several times started up in his mind. Somehow he had expected a fresh sight of the fellow to dispel and disprove what had been haunting him, had expected to find him just an outside phenomenon, not, as it were, a part of his own life. And he gazed at the carven immobility of the judge's face, trying to steady himself, as a drunken man will, by looking at a light. The regimental doctor, unabashed by the judge's comment on his absence the day before, gave his evidence like a man who had <b>better</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and the case for the prosecution was forthwith rounded in by a little speech from counsel.

60|$|Well, my dear grandchildren, from {{night to}} night through this long and weary winter I have taken you {{back with me}} into the past, and made you see scenes the players in which are all beneath the turf, save that perhaps here and there some greybeard like myself may have a {{recollection}} of them. I understand that you, Joseph, have every morning set down upon paper that which I have narrated the night before. It is as well that you should do so, for your own children and your children's children may find it of interest, and even perhaps take a pride in hearing that their ancestors {{played a part in}} such scenes.

Besides, my story draws quickly to an end now, for I had never intended to tell you more than the events connected with the Western rising. If the closing part hath been of the dreariest, and if all doth not wind up with the ringing of bells and the joining of hands, like the tales in the chap-books, you must blame history and not me. For Truth is a stern mistress, and when one hath once started off with her one must follow on after the jade, though she lead in flat defiance of all the rules and conditions which would fain turn that tangled wilderness the world into the trim Dutch garden of the story-tellers.|$|R

And William Penberthy said, 'That he would sell his life, and that dear, but never give it away.' But the lady said, 'Ah, how gladly would I die! but then la paouvre garse,' which is in French 'the poor maid,' meaning the little one. Then Mr. Oxenham fell into a very great weeping, a weakness I never saw him in before or since; and with many tears besought me never to desert that little maid, whatever might befall; which I promised, swearing to it like a heathen, but would, if I had been able, have kept it like a Christian. But on a sudden {{there was a great}} cry in the wood, and coming through the trees on all sides Spanish arquebusiers, a hundred strong at least, and negroes with them, who bade us stand or they would shoot. William Penberthy leapt up, crying 'Treason!' and running upon the nearest negro ran him through, and then another, and then falling on the Spaniards, fought manfully till he was borne down with pikes, and so died. But I, seeing no <b>thing</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> sate still and finished my plaiting.
