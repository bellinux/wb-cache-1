40|$|D. Com. (Economics) The {{objective}} in writing this thesis {{was to investigate}} the capital structure of South African manufacturing industry and the implications of this structure for policy formation relating to industry. The capital stock of the 27 branches of the manufacturing industry were calculated by means of the perpetual inventory method based on the following assumptions: capital formation excludes transactions relating to inventory, durable consumer goods and financial assets; transactions in land and other fixed assets were taken into consideration; leasing was regarded as investment and capitalised at ten times the annual base payment in respect of land and buildings and five times in respect of machinery and transport equipment; and transfer costs on property and existing buildings were treated as part of fixed investment. Cencuses compiled by the Department of Statistics were the main source of information in the calculation of investment. Depreciation was based on the straight-line-method. Price indices from various sources, including those compiled by the Reserve Bank, were used. The economic life of fixed assets for the various branches of the manufacturing industry was chosen after consultation with experts in the various industries and an analysis of information obtained by questionnaire. It was found that the real capital stock of manufacturing industry increased by 1 247 per cent during the period 1945 - 1975, i. e. at an average annual rate of 8, 8 per cent. The <b>basic</b> <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> industry with a capital stock (valued at 1975 replacement values) or R 2 478, 4 million in 1975 was the largest absolute consumer of capital followed by the food industry [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Defence date: 19 March 2007 Examining Board: Prof. Martin Rhodes, EUI/Denver University (Supervisor); Prof. Adrienne Héritier, EUI; Prof. James Caporaso, University of Washington; Prof. Willem Buiter, LSEWhy is it {{that when}} {{economic}} sectors have strong preferences and mobilise politically on a national and international level one does not always find the respective policy outcomes as ‘demand side’ international political economic theory predicts? In concentrating on the role national and international institutions play in an open polity model I argue that states (governments) and international organisations (negotiations) and the strategies of actors occupying these institutions mediate societal interests according to what I call the logic of destructive and constructive interference. States and international organisations act as constraints upon societal preferences {{at the negotiating table}} when their interests are not aligned. This is ‘destructive interference’. Conversely, when societal interests and institutional preferences are aligned states and strategies sustain or amplify societal preferences at the negotiating table. This I refer to as ‘constructive interference’. I apply this conjecture to the fifth EU enlargement process (1998 - 2004) and the negotiated exemptions to the EU accession treaties. First, I quantitatively compare the universe of cases, i. e. 44 economic sectors across the ten applicant states according to their trade, factor and asset specificity. Subsequently, I subject the theory to a qualitative analysis in three economic sectors, i. e. pharmaceuticals, <b>basic</b> <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> and the international road freight transport, across four applicant states, i. e. the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. The case studies have been based on sector and country-specific literature and 82 positional and structured interviews. The theoretical framework on the demand side has been provided by insights from modern political economy. The study finds that enlargement had a redistributive influence on sectoral incomes that resulted in preference formation and political mobilisation along sectoral lines. On the supply side, veto players and negotiation theory, combined with assumptions about political preference formation, provided hypothetical guidance. It finds that governments observed sectoral interests when their demand for protection reduced government expenditure and did not damage popular support for EU entry. On an international level, government negotiators found it easier to extract concessions from the EU when constrained by at least one domestic veto player. The EU would extend these concessions to other countries under the banner of equality and reciprocity...|$|E
40|$|M. A. Internationally, {{steel is}} the largest metal {{industry}} and the second largest man made material industry in the world (Edington, 1997). This is understandable, as steel provides {{the world with a}} versatile and low cost engineering material, which is also widely accepted because of its ability to be recycled (Edington, 1997). South Africa has large reserves of iron ore, which is used as the basic raw material in the iron and steel manufacturing process. This explains why the country is also home to a number of large iron and steel industries. In 1998 alone, 33 million tons of iron ore was mined in South Africa. In 1998 the country was rated the 21 st largest steel producing country in the world by the International Iron and Steel Institute (IISI) having produced 7. 7 million tons of crude steel (International Iron and Steel Institute (IISI), 1999). South Africa is also the largest steel producer in Africa, producing approximately 63 % of the continent's total steel production (South African Iron & Steel Institute (SAISI), 1999). The iron and steel sector contributes to the well-being and growth of the South African economy by creating employment opportunities for {{a large percentage of the}} community and serving as an important generator of foreign exchange and investments, earning in excess of R 5, 7 billion in 1997 (SAISI, 1999). In 1999 the <b>basic</b> <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> industry employed a total of 39 749 people (Statistics South Africa, 2000). In 1998 the steel industry contributed an estimated 6, 9 % to the total value of manufacturing in South Africa (SAISI, 1999). A wide range of "environmental costs" is, however, also associated with the industry's use of environmental resources, either as input or output of the manufacturing process. The latter includes the disposal of solid waste by-products, including slag, and the environmental consequences associated with its disposal will be discussed later on in the thesis. Following the growing international concern for the environment, a great number of general environmental problems were recently addressed in the South African law, resulting in a growth in the numbers and importance of environmental legislation (Barnard, 1999; Kidd, 1997). The South African environmental law, consisting of parliamentary- and provincial legislation, municipal by-laws, the principles of the common law and jurisprudence or case law, is aimed at regulating various important issues pertaining to the environment and of which the management of solid waste disposal forms an integral part (Barnard, 1999; Kidd, 1997). The disposal of solid waste, which includes the by-product slag produced by the iron and steel industries, forms a potential source of environmental pollution and is currently regulated in a fragmented and "haphazard and uncoordinated manner" (Fuggle & Rabie, 1992, p. 511), making access to various sources of law a difficult matter. The South African environmental laws are generally regarded as "ineffective" owing to the lack of adequate enforcement and the effective administration and management of environmental quality. An ignorant steel industry can and will however still run the risk of criminal prosecution and civil actions being brought against them by third parties who are detrimentally affected by the environmental pollution caused by the slag disposal practices of an industry (Bethlehem & Goldblatt, 1997). The main aim of this study is therefore to examine the potential impacts that indiscriminate slag disposal practices might have on the environment, as well as the environmental management principles and —tools developed to avoid or mitigate these impacts. The study will be of importance as it creates a better understanding of the broad basis of environmental laws specifically pertaining to slag disposal practices. It is furthermore aimed at limiting the risks of directors being criminally prosecuted and civil claims being instituted against a steel industry, while it stresses the general usefulness of departmental guidelines and -standards in achieving the goals of environmental management...|$|E
40|$|Proefskrif (DPhil) [...] PU vir CHO, 1983. The Vaal Triangle {{forms the}} southernmost {{section of the}} PWV Complex, as {{described}} in the National Physical Development Plan (1975). The so-called Vaal Triangle consists of five closely spaced urban nodes that seem to function as a single urban system. These urban nodes are the towns of Vereeniging, Meyerton, Vanderbijlpark, Sasolburg and Sebokeng (the regional residential area for Blacks in the Vaal Triangle). The Vaal Triangle spans a provincial boundary (the Vaal River), with Sasolburg situated in the Province of the Orange Free State and the other towns in the Province of Transvaal. Because of the triangular shape of this urbanized area and its location on the Vaal River, it has become known as the Vaal Triangle. The five towns had a population of 480 940 in 1980. Distances between the towns are small, although the towns are physically discrete and separated by land with non-urban uses. The average distance between the Central Business Districts of the towns is fifteen kilometers. The Vaal Triangle plays an extremely important role in regianal and national context, especially in respect of the <b>basic</b> <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> industry and the petro-chemical industry. The development of the Vaal Triangle over the past 100 years and the attraction of industry to this area can mainly be attributed to two natural factors. These factors are the occurrenee and exploitation of coal and clay deposits, and the availability of water. Two subsequent factors are the availability of rail transport and electric power. The purpose of this dissertation is to establish whether the group of closely spaced towns knows as the Vaal Triangle constitutes a "dispersed city. " In published literature the term dispersed city has been used to refer to a group of urban nodes in close proximity to each other, separated by tracts of non-urban land, and functioning as a single urban entity. If such discrete nodes do in fact constitute an urban entity, the difference in form from the single-centred city will be obvious even to the casual observer. In the conventional city, concentration and centrality would seem to be the basic requirements for urbanity, In the dispersed city it must be demonstrated that urban functions can be separated from each other by non-urban space {{and at the same time}} be integrated as an urban unit, Although the term dispersed city is widely used, there are no studies which prove that such functional agglomerations actually exist. However, if functional interdependence of a multi-nodal urban system of the sort described above, can be demonstrated in even one major instance, the concept of the dispensed city as a geographical phenomenon must be considered considerably more plausible than it is now. Section A of the dissertation, which includes chapters one to four, reviews the existing literature on the concept "city", different forms of urban systems and the "dispersed city" in particular. This study serves as background for the compilation of a theoretical model for the dispersed city, The model offers several characteristics whereby a dispersed city can be identified. These characteristics fall under the headings of structure, function and dynamism. Section B, mainly consists of a representation of the practical research that was conducted. Chapter 5 examines physical constraints that may influence urban development in the Vaal Triangle, This chapter also briefly traces the historical development of the towns, A consideration of the development of the Vaal Triangle over a period of time can help to explain the present morphology of the urban region. Past, present and future land use in the area as well as road, rail, water and electricity networks and traffic flow are also analysed and illustrated with the use of maps. Chapter 6 contains an analysis of population numbers and distribution in the area, the occupational structure of the population and a projection of the population of the towns for the year 2 000. It is concluded that if the dispersed city form of urbanism is to exist in the twenty first century 1 population growth and distribution must be considered, Chapters 7, 8, 9 and 10 exam 1 ne the function of the Vaal Triangle complex through the consideration of various forms of interaction among the towns. Service pattern, shopping patterns. functional specialization patterns, work patterns, manufacturing linkages, social and recreational patterns and patterns of government, are considered. Chapter 11 considers whether or not the "Idea of the City" is a part of the cognition of the area resident; for although the elements and attributes of a "dispersed city" may be present, it can never operate in reality unless there is a consensus about its existence. Chapter 12 consolidates the conclusions derived from chapters 1 through 11 1 STRUCTURE In the study it has been established that: 1. 1 [...] the study area consists of a group of towns close to one another, separated by tracts of non-urban land with distances small enough for residents to have a choice in the selection of important functions, 1. 2 there is no predominant town in the area as far as population size and urban functions are concerned. A dominant town surrounded by satellites would not suit the definition of a dispersed city. 1. 3 the towns are linked by a system of communications as complete and technologically advanced as economy can provide. This includes road, rail, telephone and electricity networks. 1. 4 the physical limitations that the Vaal River presents to traffic flow between the Transvaal towns and Sasolburg are overcome by three road bridges. Thus, on the basis of structure, the Vaal Triangle meets the criteria for a "dispersed city" as defined in the model. 2. FUNCTION 2. 1 [...] inter-nodal specialization exists in the study area and is responsible for the intensive movement of people between the towns. Inter-nodal specialization consists of the following: a) Vereeniging is the main shopping centre - specializing especially in clothing, furniture, office equipment, motor spares and textiles, b) Vanderbijlpark is the headquarters for tertiary education in the Vaal Triangle - the campuses of the Potchefstroom University for Higher Christian Education and the Vaal Triangle Technicon are situated on the Vaal River in Vanderbijlpark, These campuses are frequented by White students from all over the Vaal Triangle. c) There is a concentration of recreational facilities on both banks of the Vaal River. This centrally located recreational area is very popular and serves the whole Vaal Triangle, d) The employment fields of the towns in general and that of the metal industry (in Vereeniging, Meyerton and Vanderbijlpark) and the petrochemical Industry (in Sasolburg) in particular, indicate considerable inter-nodal interaction. e) The Vaalweekblad, printed in Vanderbijlpark, serves as a regional newspaper for the whole area, f) Sebokeng is the regional residential area for Blacks in the Vaal Triangle and the headquarters of the Orange-Vaal Administration Board that controls all the Black residential areas in the Vaal Triangle. 2. 2 development is guided by a general guide plan for the whole area. The purpose of the guide plan does not imply detailed planning, but the formulation of an overall planning policy which will serve as the framework for further planning action at provincial or local government level, Therefore, on the basis of function, the Vaal Triangle meets the most important specified criteria for classification as a dispersed city. 3. DYNAI SM 3. 1 There exists intensive human interaction between the towns namely to work, shop, seek higher education, to visit friends and family, and to make use of recreational facilities. The degree of interaction between the towns can be regarded as sufficient to consider the Vaal Triangle a single functional entity. 3. 2 The intensive daily traffic flow between the towns is a further indication of functional interdependence and the existence of a dispersed city, 3. 3 Although the greatest share of household moves takes place within the town of the movers, moves between the towns of the Vaal Triangle account for one third or more of urban mobility in the area. 3. 4 The Vaal Transport Company (bus service for Blacks in the Vaal Triangle) serves all the Black townships in the area and is responsible for intensive interaction with shopping areas and places of work in the White areas and for social visits to other Black townships in the area, 3. 5 The "filling-in" of the rural spaces between the towns is taking place, but has as yet not proceeded to the point where the Vaal Triangle can be regarded as one continuous urbanized area that has lost its dispersed character, Therefore, in terms of dynamism, the Vaal Triangle meets the specified criteria for classification as a dispersed city. 4. OTHER CRITERIA 4. 1 The pre-dominant role played by industry in the development of all the towns of the Vaal Triangle and the predominance of industrial employment, lend a certain amount of unity to the area. 4. 2 The "idea of city" does already exist on the level of local government, but there is as yet no unanimity on this delicate matter. 4. 3 Eighty percent of the area residents do not yet confer "city" status on the Vaal Triangle, 5 CONCLUSION The status of a dispersed city can be conferred on the Vaal Triangle if the area is compared with the criteria implicit in the dispersed city model, As yet, residents of the Vaal Triangle dispersed city barely know of its existence and know nothing of its structure and functions. In the light of the continuous "filling-in" of the non-urban areas between the towns, and the Guide Plan's proclaimed, long term development strategy to extend the Vaal Triangle as an emerging independent metropolis (Office of the Prime Minister, 1982, p 52), a step towards accepting the idea of city, surely will result.
