5|$|When {{civilian}} government {{was introduced in}} Romblon by the Americans on 16 March 1901, Banton {{was one of the}} 11 new municipalities reinstated or created. In 1918, the municipality was renamed Jones in honor of American congressman William Jones, who authored the Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916 that provided for greater autonomy for the Philippines under American colonial rule. On 8 June 1940, with the passage of Commonwealth Act No. 581, all of Romblon's municipalities were dissolved and Jones, together with Corcuera and Concepcion, were consolidated into a special municipality called Maghali, one of four special municipalities that the law created (the rest being Romblon, Tablas and Sibuyan). The reorganization proved to <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> province's local leaders, and after World War II, Republic Act No. 38 repealed Commonwealth Act No. 581, restoring Jones to its pre-war status. On 24 April 1959, Republic Act No. 2158 restored the island to its former name, Banton.|$|E
5|$|Because Allied {{air superiority}} meant it would <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Germans {{to move up}} their reserves, Rommel {{believed}} that their best chance was to stop the invasion at the shore. The scope of the invasion meant that once these coastal defences were defeated and the troops scattered, {{it was difficult to}} defend territory inland or launch counter-attacks. At 22:33, Kraiss ordered the 352nd Division to create a defensive line north of Bayeux but this proved impossible, as most of the territory involved was already in British hands and all the defending units had taken serious losses. The Luftwaffe played only a minor role on D-Day. At Gold, several small groups of bombers that arrived at sunset caused Allied casualties at Le Hamel and damaged a road near Ver-sur-Mer. At 06:00 on 7 June, the operations room of , offshore near Gold, was damaged by a bomber attack, but the ship was able to remain on station. The unit responsible was likely II./Kampfgeschwader 40 (KG 40—Bomber Wing 40). Under the command of Fliegerführer Atlantik (Flyer Command Atlantic), it was based at Bordeaux–Merignac. On the evening of the 6/7 June 1944, 26 Heinkel He 177 heavy bombers equipped with Henschel Hs 293 anti-ship guided missiles attacked shipping over Normandy, included the Gold area. II./KG 40 lost 13 aircraft to all causes during the attack.|$|E

A German flotilla, eight warships in Manila Bay, provoked the US Navy in the Philippines into firing warning shots but no damaging shots. Germany expected the US to be defeated by a guerrilla war in the Philippines and so they backed down from direct hostilities, electing instead to supply the guerrillas. However, by April 1899 the US had gained control of the Philippines, Guam, Samoa, and Hawaii in the Pacific, and also Puerto Rico in the Caribbean. A soon-to-be independent Cuba came under American economic influence. German plans for a Caribbean base were obstructed.|$|E

25|$|Al-Azhar University's Council of Senior Scholars {{was founded}} in 1911 but was {{replaced}} in 1961 by the Center for Islamic Research. In July 2012, after the law restricting Al-Azhar University's autonomy was modified by the incoming president Mohamed Morsi, the Council was reformed. The Council consists of 40 members and as of February 2013 had 14 vacancies all appointed by the current imam of Al-Azhar, Ahmed El-Tayeb, who was appointed by the prior president, Hosni Mubarak. Once the remaining 14 vacancies are filled, new vacancies will be appointed by the existing Council itself. All four madhahib (schools) of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence are proportionally represented on the Council (Hanafi, Shafi'i, Hanbali, Maliki) and voting is on a majority basis. In addition to El-Tayeb, other prominent members of the Council include the outgoing Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa. The Council is tasked with nominating the Grand Mufti of Egypt (subject to presidential approval), electing the next Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Mosque, {{and is expected to}} be the final authority in determining if new legislation is compliant with Islamic law. Although the Council's decisions are not binding (absent new legislation), it is expected that it would <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> parliament to pass legislation deemed by the Council as against Islamic law.|$|E
25|$|On 16 June at 10:00 am, MacDonald's vanguard arrived near Piacenza {{and began}} {{pressing}} Ott's command. Suvorov reiterated his orders for Ott {{to make a}} fighting retreat to the Stradella defile. By this time Austrian military engineer Albert Johann de Best got the Piacenza citadel into a defensible state after eight days of work; two or three companies of the Fröhlich Regiment were assigned to garrison it. Victor's division led the French attack on Ott as Rusca's soldiers edged toward the south as if to flank the Austrians out of position. That night, Suvorov's chief of staff Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles rushed toward Ott's position with 100 dragoons of the Karaczay Regiment plus a half-battery of horse artillery. Following behind was an improvised force including the Wouwermanns Grenadier Battalion, three battalions of the Fröhlich Regiment, {{the remainder of the}} Karaczay Regiment and one and one-half batteries of horse artillery. If Ott could hold out along the Tidone River, it would allow ample space for the Austro-Russian army to deploy between the Po and the mountain spurs to the south. If Ott were forced back into the narrow Stradella position, it would <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Allies to form a line of battle and might even cause a rout.|$|E
25|$|Tatsuro Udo, battle {{programmer}} for Eternia, Rebirth and Graces, {{helped design}} the battle system. During {{the beginning of}} development, the team had to recreate the basic gameplay from the Xillia games to work off, which proved a difficult task for the team. The battle system was intended to combine familiar elements from previous installments with new ideas intended to refresh the series. Creating the seamless transition between exploration and combat, as well as implementing Armitization, proved to <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> team. The idea of encountering and fighting enemies in the same space as exploration was designed to help evoke a fresh sense of adventure for players, as the team felt the previous method of transferring to a separate battle arena was limiting the series' development. Until the battle system's completion, development of other systems related to it was slow. As part of this development, a completely new engine had to be developed for the game, rather than just modified their old engine {{as they did in}} the past. Because of a staff shortage, developing the game was harder than previous titles and took a longer time. The PlayStation 3 was chosen as the original platform of release as the next generation of gaming hardware had yet to take off in Japan in terms of sales, and Bandai Namco was unwilling to take the risk of releasing on platforms with low install bases.|$|E

White has already ceded {{the advantage of the}} first move, and knows it, whereas Black is challenged to find ways to seize the initiative." [...] Two famous examples of White losses in the Exchange French are M. Gurevich–Short and Tatai–Korchnoi. In M. Gurevich–Short, a game between two of the world's leading players, White needed only a draw to qualify for the Candidates Matches, while Black needed to win. Gurevich played passively and was outplayed by Short, who achieved the necessary win, qualified for the Candidates, and ultimately went on to challenge Kasparov for the World Championship. In Tatai–Korchnoi, the Italian IM fell victim to Korchnoi's whirlwind mating attack, losing in just 14 moves.|$|E

Bob Woffenden, the author, later wrote an article for Inside Time, in December 2006, talking about the trial and its controversies.

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} debate began the Prime Minister rose to speak, {{and said that}} he [...] "sought to correct the {{impression}} [...] gave" [...] that he knew nothing about the prosecution.

His speech took over an hour, and was frequently interrupted by Conservative MPs. In his speech, Hastings took full responsibility for both the decision to prosecute and the subsequent decision to withdraw the prosecution, asking whether a censure was merited for correcting a mistake. His speech quieted the Conservatives and made it clear that a censure for the entire Parliament was going to <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Whips to enforce. The Liberal spokesman John Simon stood to speak, however, and called for the appointment of a Select Committee to investigate the case.

Liam rejoined the tour on 30 August, and on 4 September 1996, Oasis performed [...] "Champagne Supernova" [...] at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Liam made gestures at Noel during his guitar solo, then spat beer all over the stage before storming off. A few weeks later Noel flew home without the band, who followed on another flight.

500|$|Gordimer's {{response}} to the novel's unbanning was, [...] "I was indifferent to {{the opinions of the}} original censorship committee who neither read nor understood the book properly in the first place, and to those of the committee of literary experts who made this discovery, since both are part of the censorship system." [...] She attributed the unbanning to her international stature and the [...] "serious attention" [...] the book had received abroad. A number of prominent authors and literary organisations had protested the banning, including Iris Murdoch, Heinrich Böll, Paul Theroux, John Fowles, Frank Kermode, The Association of American Publishers and International PEN. Gordimer objected to the unbanning of the book because she felt the government was trying placate her with [...] "special treatment", and said that the same thing would not have happened had she been black. But she did describe the action as [...] "something of a precedent for other writers" [...] because in the book she had published a copy of an actual pamphlet written and distributed by students in the 1976 Soweto uprising, which the authorities had banned.

500|$|Many of {{the game}} {{characters}} were animated using motion capture, filmed at a rented studio at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, though this was limited by technical restraints. The character movement was also treated as being cinematic, though limited polygons heavily inhibited this. Animating non-player characters entering and driving cars proved to <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> team, due to the variety of vehicle designs. [...] "It involved chaining together dozens of different animations and altering key frames in code," [...] recalled software engineer Alan Campbell. The team used varying camera angles when animating the game's cutscenes, in order to evoke different emotions. For the voice acting, the team wanted [...] "natural, subtle performances", which proved difficult {{as many of the}} actors [...] "had in their head the idea that because video games are animated their performances needed to be animated", explained motion capture director Navid Khonsari. The game's playable protagonist is unnamed in the game, and his name is not officially revealed as Claude until his appearance in [...] (2004). He is a silent protagonist, never speaking throughout his appearances. The team decided to make Claude silent primarily because it [...] "did not seem like a major issue", due to the other challenges faced during development, and also partly to allow players to identify with the character.|$|E
