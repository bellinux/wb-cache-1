This study first drawn 1, 080 <b>bibliographic</b> <b>records</b> from 29 e-book products, and MarcEdit was used to check their quality and 14 % were found to contain errors.

Delimiting the object of study for understanding the conversion of analog <b>bibliographic</b> <b>records</b> to MARC 21 Bibliographic format, from the syntactic and semantic analysis of records described in patterns of descriptive metadata structure and content standards. The thesis of this research is that the syntactic and semantic principles of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>records,</b> defined by schemas describing and cataloging the display, in the standards of descriptive metadata structure and content standards, determine the process of converting <b>bibliographic</b> <b>records</b> MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic. Based on this context, the proposition of this research is to develop a theoretical study of the syntax and semantics of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>records,</b> by the Linguistic bias, with Saussure and Hjelmslev, which subsidize the conversion of analog <b>bibliographic</b> <b>records</b> to MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic a computational interpreter. With this proposal, it is stated, as a general goal, develop a theoretical-conceptual model of syntax and semantics in <b>bibliographic</b> <b>records</b> from Saussureano hjelmslevianos and linguistic studies of the manifestations of human language, which is applicable to a computational interpreter aimed to conversion <b>bibliographic</b> <b>records</b> to MARC 21 Bibliographic format. To reach this goal it is through the following specific objectives, divided in two groups and directed respectively to the theoretical-conceptual model of syntactic structure and semantics of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>records,</b> and the conversion of their records process: explain the relationship between syntax and semantics of bibliographic in the light of linguistic aspects studied by Saussure and Hjelmslev, applicable to analog and digital media records; submit characteristic principles of syntax and semantics in bibliographic records; look through the available literature, the methods and procedures for conversion of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>records</b> to MARC 21 Bibliographic format; set method of image processing <b>bibliographic</b> <b>records</b> in analog optical character recognition (OCR) software; present computational interpretation technique that is focused on the conversion of analog <b>bibliographic</b> <b>records</b> to MARC 21 Bibliographic Format to consider the syntactic and semantic schemas. In view of the outlined objectives, the methodological approach of the research is based on a qualitative approach, exploratory, descriptive and experimental basis and uses the literature. As a result, it is expected to contribute significantly to the Information Science Similarly, considering social, inherent in human knowledge and the solution of the problem presented aspects. The greatest social benefit occasioned by this research relates closely, the aspects of sharing <b>bibliographic</b> <b>records,</b> and the possibility of extending access to the metadata of information resources represented by the various units of information. Contributions theoretically can be glimpsed on the development of issues related to syntactic and semantic aspects of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>records,</b> and involve, at one time, the interdisciplinary Information Science, Computer Science and Linguistics.
