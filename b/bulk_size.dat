40|$|Communication {{networks}} had {{a separate}} deployment for each emerging service like Telephone networks, data networks and multimedia networks. In Integrated Services Network the packets are transmitted using efficient statistical multiplexing. In this paper, we develop and analyze a two-node communication network with {{dynamic bandwidth allocation}} having bulk arrivals. The performance of the statistical multiplexing is measured by approximating the arrival and the service process with Poisson process and the <b>bulk</b> <b>size</b> is uniform which is chosen such {{that several of the}} statistical characteristics of the communication network identically match with the Poisson process. Through mathematical modeling, the performance measures of the communication network like the joint probability generating function of the buffer size distribution, the average content of the buffers, the mean delays in transmission, the throughput of the nodes and utilization are derived explicitly under transient conditions. Through numerical studies, the sensitivity of the input parameters on the performance measures is also carried. It is observed that the dynamic bandwidth allocation strategy and <b>bulk</b> <b>size</b> distribution of the arrivals have significant effect on the performance measures. This network is much useful in satellite communications and Internet service providing, etc...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aluminum nitride was {{synthesized}} by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) with flaky aluminum {{powder in}} various {{conditions such as}} particle size, nitrogen pressure (PN 2), dilution factor (fDil), packing density, and <b>bulk</b> sample <b>size.</b> AlN content in the SHS product increases with an increase of fDil, and it eventually reaches about 95 % at fDil= 0. 6. Generally, reaction front velocity is significantly affected by PN 2 and packing density, but not by fDil. The degree of AlN conversion reduces more or less with an increase of <b>bulk</b> sample <b>size,</b> but that could be improved by using the SHS pre-prepared product as a diluent...|$|R

40|$|Frozen {{storage of}} bread has a {{substantial}} {{impact on the}} dynamics of water and ice in the crumb and crust. In this study, the impact was characterized using wheat bread stored at - 18 degrees C for a long term of similar to 4 months. The frozen bread incurred a considerable loss of the crumb water that migrated out and formed ice crystals on the bread surface. Such a moisture decrease underwent more rapidly for the bread stored without intact crust, suggesting the specific role of crust during frozen storage. Moisture also redistributed significantly within the frozen crumb, resulting in an elevated crumb heterogeneity of freezable water. This redistribution of freezable water {{was accompanied by a}} progressive recrystallization of the crumb-borne ice crystals, which were measured to grow into <b>bulk</b> <b>sizes</b> using a modified calorimetric procedure for analyzing the crumb samples at their as-frozen states...|$|R

40|$|The phase {{transition}} from a topological insulator to a trivial band insulator is studied by angle-resoled photoemission spectroscopy on Bi_ 2 -xIn_xSe_ 3 single crystals. We first report the complete evolution of the bulk band structures throughout the transition. The robust surface state and the <b>bulk</b> gap <b>size</b> (∼ 0. 50 eV) show no significant change upon doping for x = 0. 05, 0. 10 and 0. 175. At x ≥ 0. 225, the surface state completely disappears and the <b>bulk</b> gap <b>size</b> increases, suggesting a sudden gap-closure and topological {{phase transition}} around x ∼ 0. 175 - 0. 225. We discuss the underlying mechanism of the phase transition, proposing that it is governed by the combined effect of spin-orbit coupling and interactions upon band hybridization. Our study provides a new venue to investigate the mechanism of the topological phase transition induced by non-magnetic impurities. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

30|$|In {{the case}} of the {{commonly}} reported landward fining trend in tsunami deposits, a problem of the methodological approach appears. In many works, the <b>bulk</b> grain <b>size</b> of the tsunami deposits is analysed. Yet, several layers interpreted to be from various run ups and even backwash phases are also reported. The <b>bulk</b> grain <b>size</b> analyses are an average of depositional effects from several different events, even as contrasting as up rush and backwash. In some places, many layers are preserved, and in others, just one is preserved; thus, it is likely that in some cases, the averaged record from several different events (e.g., run ups, backwash) is compared with a depositional record of just one event. If the coastal zone is the major source of the sediments, then the overall landward fining trend would be expected and is indeed observed in the present study, although some of the transects exhibit significant variability.|$|R

The consequences are extra power losses or lower dynamic performances. The proposed method combines the advantages of classical controls and controls in a rotating frame: both stability and dynamic performances are obtained at low supply voltage levels.

30|$|Gold {{nanoparticles}} {{have different}} properties from its <b>bulk</b> <b>size</b> such as biocompatibility, high specific surface area, high surface energy and high conductivity. They also offer numerous adsorption sites to enzymes, antibodies and proteins, which make them an ideal choice for biosensors [12].

They concluded that enzymes are tightly adsorbed onto gold nanoparticles and these nanoparticles provide a biocompatible surface that is suitable for immobilizing active enzymes onto electrodes.

30|$|Insertion-type {{materials}} involve most cathode {{materials and}} some anode materials (such as graphite, Li 4 Ti 5 O 12, and TiO 2). The {{first generation of}} LIB uses LiCoO 2 and graphite as {{the positive and negative}} electrodes; the redox operation of both versus lithium is based on intercalation reactions. Alternative materials such as LiMn 2 O 4, LiFePO 4, and Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 have also reached the market at different levels, bringing about incremental improvements in performance [32]. Nonetheless, all these materials have intrinsic capacity limitations, which are derived from their redox mechanisms and structural aspects, i.e., the intrinsic redox activity of the transition metals and the changes the crystal structure can withstand. Such limitation handicaps the device in terms of energy density. Power density of these cathode materials with <b>bulk</b> <b>sizes</b> is also generally low due to the high level of polarization at high charge/discharge rates [32]. Therefore, the selective crystallization approach was introduced to overcome these shortcomings by decreasing diffusion paths for mass transport and increasing the surface area for charge transfer.|$|R

Frequent application of pesticides has resulted in development of pest and disease resistance, accumulating residues in produce and environmental pollution. So {{there is a need}} for alternative approach as to control pests and pathogens. Application of nanotechnology in crop protection holds a significant promise in management of insects and pathogens, by controlled and targeted delivery of agrochemicals and also by providing diagnostic tools for early detection. Nanoparticles are highly s table and are biodegradable; it can be successfully employed in production of nanocapsules for delivery of pesticides, fertilizers, and other agrochemicals. Nanoparticles display slow release of encapsulated functional molecules and reduce its frequent applications. Nanoparticles are smaller in size with more charge and larger surface area with higher stability and solubility, so behave differently from their <b>bulk</b> <b>sized</b> counterparts.
