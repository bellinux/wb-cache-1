5|$|He was {{diagnosed}} with paranoid schizophrenia six years <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> and spent fifty-three days in a mental hospital after threatening a Montana resident. He was released after testing as being of no danger to himself or anyone else. Eighteen months <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> he moved back to Valmeyer from Montana. Once home, {{he was known to}} compulsively hack at trees which filled his back yard following the Mississippi River floods of 1993. There was so much downed timber on his family's homestead that they had to ask him to stop cutting at trees. Two days prior to the Capitol shooting, at his grandmother's insistence to do something about nearby cats which were becoming a nuisance, Weston shot and killed 14 cats with a single-barreled shotgun, leaving several in a bucket and burying the rest.|$|E
5|$|Jamal al-Durrah (born c. 1963) was a {{carpenter}} and house painter <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> Since then, {{because of his}} injuries, he {{has worked as a}} truck driver. He and his wife, Amal, live in the UNRWA-run Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. As of 2013 they had four daughters and six sons, including a boy, Muhammad, born two years after the shooting.|$|E
5|$|The total {{compensation}} demanded by {{families of the}} victims came to 830,000 euros. Victims' families were also reported to want the police inspector who did not confiscate Saari's gun in the days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> (Saari was interviewed in relation to his internet videos), who was charged with dereliction of duty, to be additionally charged with involuntary manslaughter.|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} shot over 12 {{days in the}} San Juan Islands of Washington state, [...] "incorporating many {{sweeping}} landscape shots that made the woodsy location seem like the fourth member of the ensemble". Rachel Weisz was originally cast to play the character of Hannah, but had to drop out three days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot.</b> Rosemarie DeWitt was cast <b>the</b> day <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> began. <b>The</b> actors partly improvised their dialogue.|$|R
50|$|The role of Jagapati Babu was {{originally}} played by Srihari. Later, as he died <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot,</b> {{it was given}} to Jagapati Babu.|$|R
5000|$|Modelling levels (i.e., how clothed {{the model}} is) {{also must be}} fully agreed <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> starts. Once <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> has started, <b>the</b> {{photographer}} should not [...] "push" [...] the model's levels.|$|R
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> of {{the film}} began, Vidya started to use a {{prosthetic}} belly to look as close to authentically pregnant as possible. According to news reports, she met doctors and pregnant women {{to learn about the}} typical lifestyle and nuances of a pregnant woman, and also made lists of rules and superstitions followed by pregnant women. Vidya said that during her college days she often used to imitate pregnant ladies during stand-up acting among friends, an experience that helped her during the shooting.|$|E
5|$|Detective Gibson, {{who was in}} plainclothes, {{was shot}} after the suspect entered DeLay's office. Despite being mortally wounded, Detective Gibson was able to return fire and wound the suspect, who was apprehended in that office. A female tourist was grazed by bullets on her {{shoulder}} and face. She was treated for her injuries and released. Also injured was USCP Officer Douglas McMillian. Future Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tennessee, a heart surgeon who had been presiding on the Senate floor just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> resuscitated the gunman and accompanied him to D.C. General Hospital.|$|E
5|$|If {{the police}} {{identified}} Bostic even <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> occurred, {{he would have}} faced a two-year prison sentence for violating the terms of his parole, since he was out past his curfew. After the shooting, police discovered the BMW had been stolen from the Five Towns Mitsubishi car dealership in Inwood, Long Island, where Bostic worked as a salesman. A motor vehicle theft or gun possession conviction would have been Bostic's third felony, likely resulting in a lengthy prison sentence.|$|E
5000|$|Black & White & Sex {{was shot}} using a four-camera set up. Each scene was rehearsed <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot,</b> {{but not on}} the day of <b>the</b> <b>shoot.</b> This meant <b>the</b> actors were [...] "free to roam and be very much in the moment".|$|R
50|$|Storm P {{took the}} girls on a boot camp to clean <b>the</b> pores <b>before</b> <b>the</b> other days {{physical}} recording. He also taught {{them how to}} dress and to adapt in the fashion industry. Both Alexandra and Claudia won a gift cheque for doing {{the best in the}} challenge. <b>The</b> day <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> girls were surprised by a visit of their family and friends. At panel, Alexandra was sent home after her third bottom two appearance.|$|R
50|$|Filming was due {{to start}} in September 2007, but the film was delayed for {{financial}} reasons. It was later announced <b>the</b> film would <b>shoot</b> from April 2008 in Dumfries and Galloway. A week <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot,</b> Dumfries and Galloway Council announced the filming had been stopped due to financial reasons. Filming eventually started in July 2009 in Edinburgh, Haddington; Gorebridge; Midlothian; and Dallas.|$|R
5|$|Matti Juhani Saari (20 May 1986 – 23 September 2008) was {{identified}} as the gunman responsible for the shooting. Saari, a hospitality management student at the school, {{was thrown out of}} the Finnish Army in 2006, after being a member for only a month for opening fire in a woodland exercise, against orders. Saari had been the victim of bullying in secondary school and dropped out of his classes for this reason. A friend of Saari also reported that he had been seeing a psychologist in the months <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> and had been obsessed with guns.|$|E
5|$|On 28 September 2000, {{two days}} <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> the Israeli {{opposition}} leader Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem, a holy site in both Judaism and Islam with contested rules of access. The violence that followed {{had its roots}} in several events, but the visit was provocative and triggered protests that escalated into rioting across the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The uprising {{became known as the}} Second Intifada; it lasted over four years and cost around 4,000 lives, over 3,000 of them Palestinian.|$|E
5|$|Reginald Tate, who {{had played}} the title role in The Quatermass Experiment, {{collapsed}} and died on 23 August 1955, aged 58. This {{was less than a}} month <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> of the location filming for Quatermass II began, and necessitated the casting of a replacement lead actor at short notice; John Robinson was chosen to fill the part. Robinson was an experienced actor from a range of different films and television programmes since the 1930s, but was uncomfortable about taking over from Tate, and had difficulty in learning some of the technical dialogue he was required to deliver. Robinson's delivery of his lines has been criticised by some later reviewers.|$|E
5000|$|Janice {{and models}} Dominique, Gavyn and Kehoe are hired {{for a book}} by {{photographer}} Justin Monroe called [...] "Down <b>the</b> Rabbit Hole". <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot,</b> Janice advises Kehoe {{that she is not}} prepared to work with him and orders him off <b>the</b> <b>shoot.</b> Danny replaces him and Kehoe tries {{to figure out how to}} get back to Los Angeles. <b>The</b> <b>shoot,</b> despite being named for an Alice in Wonderland concept, has a Wizard of Oz theme.|$|R
50|$|The {{film has}} also been {{featured}} in @Urban Magazine, Blu-Ray.com, AMFM Magazine, Sync Weekly, Ozarks at Large on NPR, P3 Update, SEA Life Magazine, SEARK Today, Revel@Conway, and on multiple occasions, The Cleveland County Herald. Just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> in October 2011, KQ102.3 did an on-air interview with Sims, Zac Heath, Thomas Moore, Maurice Mejia, and Richard Ledbetter.|$|R
50|$|Target faces can be {{anything}} with multi pictures, cartoons, advertising (supermarket sales etc.) Film posters. The individual targets,4-5 on the face are recorded on the score sheet. All arrows have a value, misses included. Bouncers class as a miss. Line-cutters; make your own decision <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot.</b> Scoring: This is where the fun comes into it, {{make a list of}} values 5,10,15,20 & -5,-10,-15,-20. These values are then pulled out of the hat at the end of <b>the</b> <b>shoot.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Netzarim junction, {{where the}} {{shooting}} took place, is {{known locally as}} the al-Shohada (martyrs') junction. It lies on Saladin Road, a few kilometres south of Gaza City. The source of conflict at the junction was the nearby Netzarim settlement, where 60 Israeli families lived until Israel's withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. A military escort accompanied the settlers whenever they left or arrived at the settlement, and an Israeli military outpost, Magen-3, guarded the approach. The area had been the scene of violent incidents in the days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> Vice President George H. W. Bush {{received}} {{the assignment of}} running crisis management in case of emergency despite Secretary of State Alexander Haig's objection. When the White House learned of the assassination attempt, however, Bush was over Texas aboard Air Force Two, which did not have secure voice communications, and his discussions with the White House were intercepted and given to the press. The vice president was notified in Fort Worth, Texas of the shooting within eight minutes, but relying on the initial reports that Reagan was unharmed his plane flew to Austin for a speech. After learning {{that the president was}} wounded, Air Force Two refueled in Austin before returning to Washington at what its pilot described as the fastest speed in the plane's history.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{financial}} crises, {{it took more}} than one and a half years for Gopalakrishnan to finish the film. Swayamvaram {{was one of the first}} Malayalam films to use synchronised sound and to be filmed in outdoor locales, for which Gopalakrishnan used his Nagra audio recorder. The film was shot in two schedules. It was delayed due to scheduling conflicts of the lead actress, Sharada. She was working in several films at that time, so Gopalakrishnan had to arrange the schedule to suit her convenience. The lead actor, Madhu, mentioned in an interview that Gopalakrishnan was clear about his characters and their behaviour. Gopalakrishnan also used to discuss the shoot with his crew <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{intended for}} this episode {{to be the}} last to star Lucy Lawless, who portrayed Number Three. They only had Lawless for one day during the filming of the episode. Most of the Earth scenes were shot on and around Centennial Beach, in Tsawwassen, British Columbia. Two days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> much of <b>the</b> location set was destroyed by a rain storm with [...] winds, but the art department crew repaired it in time for <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> to occur on schedule.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} for this song {{was shot at}} the Minneapolis Armory in 1998 and was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence. It features the band playing the song intertwined with scenes from the film Armageddon. It features an appearance by Steven Tyler's daughter Liv, who plays Grace Stamper in the film. Steven Tyler injured his knee <b>the</b> day <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot,</b> so they used a lot of close-ups because his movement was limited.|$|R
5000|$|Cowie {{has been}} stabbed 21 times on {{separate}} occasions. One stab wound is visible as {{a scar on}} the left hand side of his face. He has talked about how he got slashed in the face three days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> of [...] "Wearing My Rolex", and the scar on his face ruined his confidence and self-esteem for a while, as {{he did not want}} to turn up to interviews or music videos.|$|R
5|$|The federal jury convicted Cisneros of {{the murder}} on May 12 after three hours of deliberation. The {{prosecution}} introduced witnesses, including the motel manager and those at the crime scene, who stated that they saw a white car driven by the suspected assassins coming from Mexico the day <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> The defense told the jurors {{that there was not}} enough evidence to uphold the conviction under federal requirements of reasonable doubt. The government concluded that it met the burden of proof for interstate or foreign commerce charges in two ways: through Garza's phone calls from Mexico, and through the matching license plates of the Mexican car that crossed into the U.S. and registered at the motel, which matched the description of the vehicle seen at the murder scene. In order to find Cisneros guilty, they were not required to prove that she intended to use interstate or foreign commerce, or even that she knew it would be used. They were required to prove that someone involved in Fischer's murder used interstate or foreign commerce or caused another person to use it. On July 27, the jury rendered their final verdict and sentenced Cisneros to life in prison. Two years later, the United States Attorney Office recognized two local police officers and three FBI agents for assisting in her prosecution.|$|E
25|$|Belcher's mother {{reported}} that he had questioned the paternity of Zoey <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> Kansas City police said that they would not investigate the claim, and that {{it would have to be}} a civil matter.|$|E
25|$|On March 28, 2007, the Hillsborough County Superior Court re-indicted Bell-Rogers on {{the weapons}} charges after {{a defense lawyer}} tried to dismiss Bell-Rogers' {{original}} indictment. That same day, Teresia Shipley pleaded guilty on charges of helping Addison rob a convenience store days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> of Briggs.|$|E
5000|$|The Hawk spacecraft, also {{designed}} by Bower, {{made its first}} and only appearance in this story. In response to concerns that it would appear too similar to the Eagles when filmed, Bray Studios technician Cyril Foster hurriedly painted orange details on <b>the</b> miniatures <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot.</b> [...] <b>The</b> model was used {{in a number of}} visual-effects publicity stills, including some where it can be seen attacking the Bethan gunship from [...] "The Last Enemy".|$|R
5000|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} July 14, 2015, and ended on August 7, 2015. Filming {{took place over}} the course of 22 days throughout California, including in San Pedro and Humboldt County for underwater work and wide vistas, respectively. Daniel Radcliffe said that music from the film was played on set: [...] "Robert composed music <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> started which never ever happens in film. We could hear the music on set for certain scenes." ...|$|R
500|$|Because the series' {{production}} doesn't build sets till [...] "a {{couple of}} days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> or even <b>the</b> day <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> or, sometimes even {{the morning of the}} shoot" [...] the stunt team was not able to coordinate with the art department and set decorators {{in the construction of the}} set, so the fight sequence had to be slightly reconfigured on the day of <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> to fit <b>the</b> set. A steam effect in the sequence proved difficult due to the special effects operator having to time it with Bennet's shooting, working around a delay in the air canister system of several seconds. Tancharoen used a handheld camera, with the operator having to [...] "run all over the place with this really heavy camera on his shoulder", but wanted to move away from the Jason Bourne, shaky-cam style of filming, saying that because of his background in choreography, [...] "It’s drilled in my head that the camera has to complement the movement of the action." [...] The shot took four takes to get right, with Bennet breaking her arm during the filming of the final take, and having to carry out the rest of her fight scenes for the season with the injury.|$|R
25|$|The Cleveland Police Department {{received}} {{statements from}} both Loehmann and Garmback. They announced {{they were looking}} for additional witnesses to the shooting, including a man who was recorded walking with Rice in the park <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> Their results would be presented to a grand jury for possible charges.|$|E

50|$|Paarthale Paravasam was {{launched}} as Balachander's 100th film {{at his office}} in Chennai. The original cast announced {{on the day of}} the launch included noted singer S. P.
