40|$|A macromodeling {{and timing}} {{simulation}} technique is presented that allows fast, accurate delay calculations for CMOS circuits. This method {{is well suited}} for delay calculations of regular structure VLSI circuits, as well as circuits designed from standard cell libraries. Timing models for both logic gate and transmission <b>gate</b> <b>circuit</b> forms are developed. For logic gates, output transition time and delay time are functions of input transition time and load impedance. Effective resistances for conducting transmission gates and switching transmission gates are functions of input transition time and load capacitance. Transmission <b>gate</b> <b>circuits</b> are then modeled as equivalent RC circuits. Separate waveform models and delay calculation methods exist for both types of circuit forms, with an interface to enable the use of both methods in the same simulation. An experimental event-driven simulator was developed to test {{the accuracy of the}} macromodels and to estimate improvements in execution time with respect to SPICE.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} choosing the gate sizes or scale factors in a combinational logic circuit {{in order to minimize}} the total area, subject to simple RC timing constraints, and a minimum allowed gate size. This problem is well known to be a geometric program (GP), and can be solved using standard interior-point methods for small and medium size problems with up to several thousand gates. In this paper we describe a new method for solving this problem that handles far larger circuits, up to a million gates, and is far faster. Numerical experiments show that our method can compute an adequately accurate solution within around 200 iterations; each iteration, in turn, consists of a few passes over the circuit. In particular, the complexity of our method, with a fixed number of iterations, is linear in the number of gates. A simple implementation of our algorithm can size a 10000 <b>gate</b> <b>circuit</b> in 25 seconds, a 100000 <b>gate</b> <b>circuit</b> in 4 minutes, and a million <b>gate</b> <b>circuit</b> in 40 minutes, approximately. For the million <b>gate</b> <b>circuit,</b> the associated GP has 3 million variables and more than 6 million monomial terms in its constraints; as far as we know, these are the largest GPs ever solved.

It is also shown that the choice of a current switch in terms of polarity, threshold voltage, and size has a significant impact on total leakage current.

The framework subsumes all known dynamic models of logic gates and—through a formal process of functional and temporal abstraction—provides a sound foundation for functional timing analysis.
