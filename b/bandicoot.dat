5|$|Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> 2: Cortex Strikes Back is a {{platform}} video game developed by Naughty Dog {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. It is the second game in the Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> series, and the sequel to the original game.|$|E
5|$|Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> is {{the first}} {{installment}} in the Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> series, chronicling {{the creation of the}} title character at the hands of series antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex and henchman Doctor Nitrus Brio. The story follows Crash as he aims to prevent Brio and Cortex's plans for world domination, and rescue his girlfriend Tawna, a female <b>bandicoot</b> also evolved by Brio and Cortex.|$|E
5|$|Crash Team Racing is {{the fourth}} {{installment}} in the Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> series. The game's story focuses on the efforts of a ragtag team of characters in the Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> series, who must race against the egomaniacal Nitros Oxide to save their planet from destruction. In the game, players can take control of one of fifteen Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> series characters, though only eight are available at first. During the races, offensive and speed boosting power ups {{can be used to}} gain an advantage.|$|E

40|$|Context: The poor {{survivorship}} {{of animals}} {{released into the}} wild for translocation, reintroduction or rehabilitation may be cited as a reason not to release experimental animals, but there is only limited information available {{on the fate of}} ex-research animals returned to the wild. Aims: This study tested the hypothesis that there is no difference in the recapture of <b>bandicoots</b> used for physiological experiments and control <b>bandicoots.</b> Methods: Six adult male <b>bandicoots</b> were trapped and maintained in captivity for three weeks for physiological experiments, then released at the capture site. Sixteen other <b>bandicoots</b> were captured and released immediately. Seven weeks after the release of the <b>bandicoots</b> used for physiological studies, follow-up trapping was carried out, and the survival, body mass and distance moved of recaptured <b>bandicoots</b> was recorded. Key results: Survivorship did not differ statistically between <b>bandicoots</b> used for physiological experiments and control <b>bandicoots,</b> with five of six experimental <b>bandicoots</b> (83 %) and 11 of 16 control <b>bandicoots</b> (69 %) recaptured. <b>Bandicoots</b> used for physiological experiments lost a significantly greater proportion of body mass than control animals, but this occurred in captivity, not after release. The distance between recaptures for both groups (0 – 224 [*]m) was consistent with previously published observations. Conclusions: My results suggest that <b>bandicoots</b> maintained in captivity for non-invasive physiological experiments can be successfully released, with survivorship at least as high as that of control animals. 1 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Context [...] The poor {{survivorship}} of {{many animals}} {{released into the}} wild for translocation, re-introduction or rehabilitation may be cited as a reason not to release experimental animals, but there is only limited information available {{on the fate of}} ex-research animals returned to the wild.

5|$|Paleontologists {{have named}} an extinct <b>bandicoot</b> from the Miocene of Australia after the character, Crash <b>bandicoot.</b> Although {{somewhat}} {{unusual for the}} scientific community, the name was used in an entirely unaltered form, without attempting to return to Latin or Greek roots.|$|E
5|$|Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised the game's graphics and unique visual style, but criticized its controls {{and lack of}} innovation as a platform game. The game went on to sell over 6 million units, making it the eighth best-selling PlayStation game of all time. A remastered version, included in the Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> N. Sane Trilogy collection, was released for the PlayStation 4 in June 2017.|$|E
5|$|Five new {{characters}} in the series make their appearance in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, of which {{the most important is}} Doctor Cortex's genetically enhanced superweapon Crunch <b>Bandicoot,</b> a bionic <b>bandicoot</b> created for the purpose of destroying Crash <b>Bandicoot.</b> Acting as Crunch's power source are the Elementals, a group of destructive masks who control the elements of Earth, Water, Fire and Air. The Elementals consist of Rok-Ko, a temperamental and rock-headed earthbending mask who controls earthquakes and landslides, Wa-Wa, a waterbending mask who controls thunderstorms and floods, Py-Ro, an easily perturbed firebending mask who controls volcano eruptions, and Lo-Lo, a joke-cracking airbending mask who controls tornadoes.|$|E

25|$|The <b>bandicoots</b> {{have been}} {{recorded}} as present on the peninsula since the first Europeans settled in the area, {{at one point during}} the history of the peninsula the population of <b>bandicoots</b> dwindled due to the introduction of rabbits to the area. The Mount Henry Conservation Group has eradicated all rabbits from the area and there are records of <b>bandicoots</b> re-inhabiting the peninsula.|$|R
5|$|On September 21, 2000, Universal Interactive Studios and Konami {{announced}} that they had entered an agreement that would enable Konami to publish a Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> game for next-generation game systems, with Universal Interactive handling {{the production of the}} games. The agreement served to break the Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> franchise's exclusivity to Sony-produced consoles and effectively made Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> a mascot character for Universal rather than Sony. After Universal fell out with Cerny and Sony, Traveller's Tales was forced to alter the game from a free-roaming title to a standard Crash title. Traveller's Tales had to begin development of the game from scratch and were given only twelve months to complete the game.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{returning}} {{characters from}} previous Crash titles star in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex along with five new characters. The protagonist of the game, Crash <b>Bandicoot,</b> is a genetically enhanced eastern barred <b>bandicoot</b> who must defeat the antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex {{and his new}} superweapon. Coco <b>Bandicoot,</b> Crash's younger sister, is a highly intelligent computer expert {{with an interest in}} Hong Kong martial arts films. Aku Aku is an omnipotent witch doctor who guides and aids Crash and Coco in stopping the plans of Doctor Neo Cortex. Pura, Coco's pet tiger cub, serves a very minor role and appears only in the introduction of the game.|$|E
5|$|The voice cast of {{the game}} {{consists}} of Clancy Brown as Doctor Neo Cortex and Uka Uka, Mel Winkler as Aku Aku, Kevin Michael Richardson as Crunch <b>Bandicoot</b> and an advisor of Velo, Debi Derryberry as Coco <b>Bandicoot</b> and Polar, Steven Blum as Emperor Velo XXVII and Crash <b>Bandicoot,</b> Billy West as Nash and Zam, Dwight Schultz as Dingodile and Fake Crash, Marshall R. Teague as Krunk, John DiMaggio as Tiny Tiger, Michael Ensign as Doctor Nefarious Tropy, Quinton Flynn as Doctor N.

40|$|Knowledge of how animals {{cope with}} their {{environment}} is fundamental to the management of free-ranging populations. Urban animals face increased competition for resources, habitat fragmentation and predation. These pressures may impact an individual's welfare by releasing glucocorticoid hormones in the blood through a response from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in altered energy storage and utilisation. This study aimed to determine the applicability of measuring faecal glucocorticoid metabolites in free-ranging <b>bandicoots</b> by using a simple enzyme immunoassay. We used long-nosed and southern brown <b>bandicoots</b> in northern Sydney to investigate whether environmental and demographic variables can influence faecal glucocorticoid metabolites. Long-nosed <b>bandicoots</b> showed similar faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations between suburban backyards and National Park populations. Higher faecal glucocorticoid metabolites were recorded in female southern brown <b>bandicoots</b> than in males, whilst female and male long-nosed <b>bandicoots</b> had similar glucocorticoid metabolite levels. Ectoparasite load, body condition and season did not influence faecal glucocorticoid metabolites. This non-invasive method has a broad application {{and can be used}} to provide biological information to guide management of populations within a conservation context. 7 page(s...|$|R
5|$|Crash Boom Bang!, {{known in}} Japan as Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> Festival, {{is a party}} game {{developed}} by Dimps and published by Vivendi Universal Games in Japan and by Sierra Entertainment internationally for the Nintendo DS. It was released in Japan on July 20, 2006, in North America on October 10, 2006, in Europe on October 27, 2006, and in Australia on November 2, 2006.

5|$|Doctor Neo Cortex and his {{assistant}} Doctor Nitrus Brio create the Evolvo-Ray, a device they use to mutate the various animals living on the islands into beasts with superhuman strength. They experiment on Crash, a peaceful <b>bandicoot</b> who Cortex intends {{to be the leader}} of his growing military of animal soldiers. Despite Brio's warnings, Cortex subjects Crash to the untested Cortex Vortex in an attempt to control him. The Vortex rejects Crash, allowing him to escape. After Crash leaps out a window and falls to the ocean below, Cortex prepares a female <b>bandicoot</b> named Tawna for experimentation.|$|E
5|$|The playable protagonist {{character}} is Crash <b>Bandicoot,</b> a <b>bandicoot</b> {{who has been}} mutated by an invention called the Evolvo-Ray. The main antagonist is Doctor Neo Cortex, a mad scientist who was often ridiculed by the scientific community for his outlandish theories and is now motivated to prove his tormentors wrong by creating a mutated army of animals to conquer the world. Cortex's henchman is Doctor Nitrus Brio, the insecure creator of the Evolvo-Ray. Crash's love interest is Tawna, a female <b>bandicoot</b> about to undergo experimentation by the doctors. Helping Crash in his journey is an ancient witch doctor spirit {{by the name of}} Aku Aku, who has scattered masks of himself throughout the islands to grant Crash special invincibility powers.|$|E

5|$|Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> 2: Cortex Strikes Back {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics {{and was considered}} to be superior to its predecessor. Much of the praise went to the game's graphics, control and music, with major criticisms varying between the trial-and-error gameplay, lack of level variety, easy boss levels and lack of innovation. The game went on {{to become one of the}} best-selling PlayStation video games of all time and replaced its predecessor as the highest-selling Western title in Japan at the time, selling more than 800,000 units in the country by April 1998. A remastered version was included in the Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> N. Sane Trilogy collection, released on the PlayStation 4 in June 2017.|$|E
5|$|Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> is a mutated <b>bandicoot</b> {{who must}} travel through time and stop Doctor Neo Cortex from {{gathering}} the Crystals. He is aided by Aku Aku, an ancient witch doctor mask who protects Crash from harm {{and gives him}} sage advice between levels. Also helping Crash is his younger sister Coco <b>Bandicoot,</b> who gathers the Crystals on the Great Wall of China, on the surfaces above Atlantis and in the skies of World War I Europe. Crash's enemy, Doctor Neo Cortex, has been aided by his mentor, Aku Aku's twin brother Uka Uka. Aku Aku previously locked Uka Uka away to protect the world from him, but has been freed because of Cortex's bumblings. Aiding Doctor Cortex and Uka Uka is Doctor Nefarious Tropy, the self-proclaimed master {{of time and the}} creator of the Time Twisting Machine used to gather Crystals and Gems in different time periods. Cortex's other allies include Tiny Tiger, a tall, hulking beast who battles Crash in the Colosseum; Dingodile, a half-dingo half-crocodile hybrid with a large flamethrower; and Doctor N. Gin, a scientist with a missile in his head.|$|E

50|$|The short-nosed <b>bandicoots</b> (genus Isoodon) {{are members}} of the order Peramelemorphia. These {{marsupials}} can be found across Australia, although their distribution can be patchy. Genetic evidence suggests that short-nosed <b>bandicoots</b> diverged from the related long-nosed species around eight million years ago, during the Miocene epoch, and underwent a rapid diversification around three million years ago, during the late Pliocene.|$|R
5|$|Taking {{place on}} a fictional group of islands near Australia, Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> 2 follows the adventures of the {{anthropomorphic}} <b>bandicoot</b> Crash. Crash is abducted by series villain Doctor Neo Cortex, who has seemingly turned over a new leaf and wants to save the world. Crash is thrust into several parts of N. Sanity Island in order to gather Crystals that will allow Cortex to contain the power of an upcoming planetary alignment and keep the planet from being destroyed. Crash is joined by his sister Coco, who is suspicious of Cortex's true intentions, and by Doctor Nitrus Brio, who tries to persuade Crash to gather Gems instead of Crystals.|$|E

The main game systems and game code as a whole were coded by John Hodskinson. The game's music is composed by Andy Blythe and Marten Joustra of Swallow Studios. A rearranged version of the original Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> theme by Mutato Muzika's Josh Mancell also appears in the game. The game's sound effects were created by Ron Horwitz, Tom Jaeger, John Robinson, and Harry Woolway of Universal Sound Studios. The game's voice actors were cast and directed by Margaret Tang. Clancy Brown voices the dual role of Doctor Neo Cortex and Uka Uka, while Mel Winkler provides the voice of Aku Aku. Crash and Coco <b>Bandicoot</b> are respectively voiced by Brendan O'Brien and Debi Derryberry. Corey Burton voices the returning villains Doctor N. Gin and Doctor Nefarious Tropy.
