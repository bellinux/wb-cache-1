The vertebrae were articulated in a procoelous manner, meaning they had a concave hollow on the front end and a convex bulge on the rear; these would have fit together to produce a <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> joint.

5|$|Paley's Natural Theology is an {{extended}} argument, constructed around {{a series of}} examples including finding a watch; comparing the eye to a telescope; {{and the existence of}} finely adapted mechanical structures in animals, such as joints which function like hinges or manmade <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> joints. Paley argues that these all lead to an intelligent Creator, and that a system is {{more than the sum of}} its parts. The last chapters are more theological in character, arguing that the attributes of God must be sufficient for the extent of his operations, and that God must be good because designs seen in nature are beneficial.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe's neck {{vertebrae}} have <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> joints. In particular, the atlas–axis joint (C1 and C2) {{allows the}} animal to tilt its head vertically and reach more branches with the tongue. The point of articulation between the cervical and thoracic vertebrae of giraffes is shifted to lie {{between the first}} and second thoracic vertebrae (T1 and T2), unlike most other ruminants where the articulation is between the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) and T1. This allows C7 to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T1 is actually C8, and that giraffes have added an extra cervical vertebra. However, this proposition is not generally accepted, as T1 has other morphological features, such as an articulating rib, deemed diagnostic of thoracic vertebrae, and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven cervical vertebrae are generally characterised by increased neurological anomalies and maladies.|$|E
5|$|Protosuchians were small, mostly {{terrestrial}} animals with short snouts and long limbs. They had bony armor {{in the form}} of two rows of plates extending from head to tail, and this armor is retained by most modern crocodilians. Their vertebrae were convex on the two main articulating surfaces, and their bony palates were little developed. The mesosuchians saw a fusion of the palatine bones to form a secondary bony palate and a great extension of the nasal passages to near the pterygoid bones. This allowed the animal to breathe through its nostrils while its mouth was open under the water. The eusuchians continued this process with the interior nostrils now opening through an aperture in the pterygoid bones. The vertebrae of eusuchians had one convex and one concave articulating surface, allowing for a <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> type joint between the vertebrae, bringing greater flexibility and strength. The oldest known eusuchian is Hylaeochampsa vectiana from the lower Cretaceous of the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. It was followed by crocodilians such as the Pristichampsidae, the so-called 'hoofed crocodiles', in the Palaeogene. Spanning the Cretaceous and Palaeogene periods is the genus Borealosuchus of North America, with six species, though its phylogenetic position is not settled.|$|E

25|$|Imbrication of the rectus muscles over a nonintegrated implant {{traditionally}} {{was thought}} to impart movement to the implant and prosthesis. Like a ball-and-socket joint, when the implant moves, the prosthesis moves.

The recent myoconjuctival technique of enucleation is an alternative to muscle imbrication.|$|E

The titanium is often alloyed with about 4% aluminium or 6% Al and 4% vanadium.Titanium has the inherent ability to osseointegrate, enabling use in dental implants that can last for over 30 years. This property is also useful for orthopedic implant applications. These benefit from titanium's lower modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus) to more closely match that of the bone that such devices are intended to repair. As a result, skeletal loads are more evenly shared between bone and implant, leading to a lower incidence of bone degradation due to stress shielding and periprosthetic bone fractures, which occur at the boundaries of orthopedic implants. However, titanium alloys' stiffness is still {{more than twice that}} of bone, so adjacent bone bears a greatly reduced load and may deteriorate.|$|R

Charles M. Sternberg reconstructed it with the upper arm oriented almost perpendicular to the body, another idea that has gone by the wayside.

This device is made of stainless steel with a broad base where a main rod is fixed. Two side rods are fixed with clamps, attached to the main rod. Both can be raised or lowered according to the requirement. The upper one is provided with a pipette-holder where the pipette with the material can be inserted. The lower one is provided with a grooved plate with a <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> a <b>socket</b> to adjust the angle.

40|$|At {{present the}} effects of {{friction}} {{are not included in}} three-dimensional mechanism simulation packages because of the difficulty of determining a friction model for joints such as the spherical joint where the frictional resistance to motion depends not only upon the coefficient of friction and the magnitude of the loading on the joint but also on the pressure distribution within the joint resulting from that loading. Thus the basis of this thesis has been the development of a mathematical model of {{the effects of}} friction in a spherical joint which could then be incorporated into a mechanisms simulation program. The model developed has shown that the main factors determining the magnitudes and directions of the frictional effects produced in a spherical joint, apart from the coefficient of friction and the magnitude of the loading, are the extent of the contact area between the <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> the <b>socket</b> <b>and</b> the magnitude of the angle between the axis of rotation of the joint and the direction of the applied load. Experimental results were obtained using apparatus that enabled the frictional moment produced on the socket of a joint to be measured while allowing the angle between the axis of rotation of the <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> the direction of the applied load to be varied between measurements. These results, obtained for a range of values of the coefficient of friction, confirm that this angle is a significant factor in the model and that the model usefully determines the frictional effects produced in a spherical joint...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} hip post-surgery problem is named Edge Loading (EL).

Materials and methodsFor this study, three prosthetic designs were made I, II, and III on epoxy resin model representing mandibular unilateral distal extension edentulous area with the second premolar as the main abutment and implant was placed at the site of the second molar. For group (I), The design principle was (RPI clasp on the second premolar abutment, lingual bar major connector, double Aker clasp on the first and second molar on the other side <b>and</b> (<b>ball</b> & <b>socket)</b> attachment on the implant). For group (II) the design principle was ((RPI clasp on the second premolar abutment <b>and</b> (<b>ball</b> & <b>socket)</b> attachment on the implant)). For group (III) implant tooth connected fixed partial denture was fabricated using the 2 nd premolar as mesial abutment and the implant as distal abutment. A self-protected linear strain gauge was used for this study to measure the micro-strain induced on the buccal and lingual sides of the implant and 2 nd premolar abutment. ResultsSPSS software program was used in the statistical analysis of the results. The results revealed that Maximum stresses induced at tooth and implant abutments were in case of group (II) design and distribution of micro-strain between the implant and tooth abutment in case of group (III) design was better than distribution in cases of the two other groups.
