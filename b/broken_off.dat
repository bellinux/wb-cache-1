5|$|By September 1949, {{information}} from the Venona project indicated to GCHQ that Fuchs was a spy, but the British intelligence services were wary of indicating {{the source of their}} information. The Soviets had <b>broken</b> <b>off</b> contact with him in February. Fuchs may have been subsequently tipped off by Kim Philby. In October 1949, Fuchs approached Henry Arnold, the head of security at Harwell, with the news that his father had been given a chair at the University of Leipzig in East Germany.|$|E

5|$|Family {{tradition}} {{holds that}} Johnson broke off an early marital engagement {{when he was}} about sixteen years old because of his mother's disapproval. Purportedly Johnson vowed revenge for his mother's interference. Despite the fact that the engagement was <b>broken</b> <b>off,</b> a daughter named Celia was born.

The eyes were also blacked out and pieces had been <b>broken</b> <b>off,</b> rendering it damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|After Busch {{had spent}} six months with his uncle Kleine at Lüthorst, he {{expressed}} an aim to continue study in Munich. This request caused a rift with his father who, however, eventually funded this move; - see for comparison Busch's illustrated story of Painter Klecksel. Busch's expectations of the Munich Academy of Fine Arts were not met. His life became aimless; there were occasional return visits to Lüthorst, but contact with his parents had been <b>broken</b> <b>off.</b> In 1857 and 1858, as his position seemed to be without prospects, he contemplated emigration to Brazil to keep bees.|$|E
5|$|After {{peace talks}} between the Germans and the Finnish Reds were <b>broken</b> <b>off</b> on 11 April, the true battle for the capital of Finland began.

The Germans broke through the area between Munkkiniemi and Pasila, and advanced on the central-western parts of the town. The German naval squadron Meurer blocked the city harbour, bombarded the southern town area, and landed naval troops at Katajanokka.|$|E
60|$|The trap {{was this}} time set too openly, {{even for the}} royal personage, to fall into it. He hurried on, calling to his son, and not {{answering}} a word. The Vampire therefore resumed the thread of his story {{at the place where}} he had <b>broken</b> it <b>off.</b>|$|R
60|$|We {{skirted the}} lonely little lake called the Daubensee, and {{presently}} passed close by a glacier on the right--a thing {{like a great}} river frozen solid in its flow and <b>broken</b> square <b>off</b> like a wall at its mouth. I {{had never been so}} near a glacier before.|$|R

5|$|I have then {{considered}} {{myself as}} a particle <b>broken</b> <b>off</b> from the grand mass of mankind; — I was alone, till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like the attraction of adhesion, made me feel that I was still {{a part of a}} mighty whole, from which I could not sever myself—not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or poisons the current of the heart.|$|E
5|$|In late 1992 Takanohana {{announced}} his engagement to actress Rie Miyazawa, news which sparked a similar amount of coverage {{to the royal}} wedding held that year. However the engagement was <b>broken</b> <b>off</b> the following year, reportedly because Miyazawa was seen by Takanohana's parents and the Sumo Association as being unwilling to sacrifice her career to become a regular stable wife. The role of {{the wife of a}} head coach in looking after the stable's recruits and liaising with supporter's groups is regarded as a full-time job.|$|E
5|$|LACM 149371 is {{a poorly}} {{preserved}} molar-like tooth that largely lacks a recognizable enamel surface and shows many small grooves and holes on the crown surface. This suggests the tooth {{may have been}} chemically degraded, perhaps by acidic water or because it passed through the digestive tract of a predator. The roots are <b>broken</b> <b>off,</b> but remaining pulp cavities suggest the presence of four main roots, which are partially joined into two pairs. A smaller pulp cavity between those roots suggests the likely presence of a fifth root and a slight depression in the tooth may represent another root.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{suffered}} a severe stroke on April 18, 1994, while preparing to eat dinner in his Park Ridge, New Jersey home. A blood clot {{resulting from the}} atrial fibrillation he had suffered for many years had formed in his upper heart, <b>broken</b> <b>off,</b> and traveled to his brain. He was taken to New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg. Damage to the brain caused swelling (cerebral edema), and Nixon slipped into a deep coma. He died at 9:08p.m. on April 22, 1994, with his daughters at his bedside. He was 81 years old.|$|E
5|$|Spending {{summer and}} autumn 1836 in Trier, Marx became more serious about his studies and his life. He became engaged to Jenny von Westphalen, an educated {{baroness}} of the Prussian ruling class {{who had known}} Marx since childhood. As she had <b>broken</b> <b>off</b> her engagement with a young aristocrat to be with Marx, their relationship was socially controversial owing to the differences between their religious and class origins, but Marx befriended her father Ludwig von Westphalen (a liberal aristocrat) and later dedicated his doctoral thesis to him. Seven years after their engagement, on 19 June 1843 they got married in a Protestant church in Kreuznach.|$|E
5|$|The Axis {{threat to}} Australia {{developed}} gradually and until 1942 {{was limited to}} sporadic attacks by German armed merchantmen. The level of Axis naval activity peaked {{in the first half}} of 1942 when Japanese submarines conducted anti-shipping patrols off Australia's coast, and Japanese naval aviation attacked several towns in northern Australia. The Japanese submarine offensive against Australia was renewed {{in the first half of}} 1943 but was <b>broken</b> <b>off</b> as the Allies pushed the Japanese onto the defensive. Few Axis naval vessels operated in Australian waters in 1944 and 1945, and those that did had only a limited impact.|$|E
