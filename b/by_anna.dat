5|$|Louis XIV was angered <b>by</b> <b>Anna</b> Maria Luisa's {{marriage}} to his sworn foe. Cosimo, after much coaxing, persuaded him otherwise. On 9 October 1691, France, England, Spain, and the United Provinces guaranteed the neutrality of the Tuscan port of Livorno. The Empire, meanwhile, {{was attempting to}} extract feudal dues from Cosimo, and ordering him to ally with Austria. The Grand Duke replied {{that if he did}} so France would send a naval fleet from Toulon to occupy his state; the Emperor reluctantly accepted this excuse. Tuscany was not alone in its feudal ties to the Empire: The rest of Italy was also bound to pay the Emperor, but at a much higher magnitude than Cosimo, who merely paid on his few undisputed Imperial fiefs.|$|E
