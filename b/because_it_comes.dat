5|$|Like most lanthanides, {{praseodymium}} {{usually only}} uses three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: {{this is because}} the 4f orbitals penetrate the most through the inert xenon core of electrons to the nucleus, followed by 5d and 6s, and this increases with higher ionic charge. Praseodymium nevertheless can continue losing a fourth and even occasionally a fifth valence electron <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough and the 4f subshell energy high enough to allow the removal of further valence electrons. Thus, similarly to the other early trivalent lanthanides, praseodymium has a double hexagonal close-packed crystal structure at room temperature. At about 560°C, it transitions to a face-centered cubic structure, and a body-centered cubic structure appears shortly before the melting point of 935°C.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{literature}} suggests that free riding can be overcome without any state intervention. Peer-to-peer punishment, that is, members sanction those members that do {{not contribute to the}} public good at a cost, is sufficient to establish and maintain cooperation. Such punishment is often considered altruistic, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> at a cost to the punisher, however, the exact nature remains to be explored. Whether costly punishment can explain cooperation is disputed. Recent research finds that costly punishment is less effective in real world environments. For example, punishment works relatively badly under imperfect information, where people cannot observe the behavior of other perfectly.|$|E
25|$|A schema (pl. schemata) is {{the mental}} {{framework}} that is created as children {{interact with their}} physical and social environments. For example, many 3-year-olds insist that the sun is alive <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> {{up in the morning}} and goes down at night. According to Piaget, these children are operating based on a simple cognitive schema that things that move are alive. At any age, children rely on their current cognitive structures to understand the world around them. Moreover, younger and older children may often interpret and respond to the same objects and events in very different ways because cognitive structures take different forms at different ages.|$|E

500|$|Critic John Leonard, in {{a review}} in The New York Times, {{described}} The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five as [...] "a remarkable recovery" [...] from Shikasta, which he called a [...] "disaster". He said The Marriages works for him <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> across as a fable, like an instructive Sufi tale. Writing in HuffPost Culture, University of Bristol academic Tom Sperlinger called the book [...] "a legend" [...] and listed it amongst his five recommended Lessing books that she as written since The Golden Notebook (1962). Pierson found the book [...] "enjoyable", despite the [...] "dry and bookish sound" [...] dialogue which felt like a translation. He added that readers familiar with Lessing's fortitude in The Golden Notebook may not appreciate her allegory in The Marriages. While she is still [...] "passionate, opinionated and outraged" [...] here, Pierson said Lessing has withdrawn from writing about {{the real world and}} chosen to [...] "soar unsteady currents of whimsy, dreams [...] mysticism".|$|E
500|$|Breaking {{started out}} {{strictly}} as toprock, footwork-oriented dance moves performed while standing up. Toprock usually {{serves as the}} opening to a breaker's performance before transitioning into other dance moves performed on the floor. A separate dance style that influenced toprock is uprock, also called rocking or Brooklyn uprock, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from Brooklyn, New York. The uprock dance style {{has its roots in}} gangs. Although it looks similar to toprock, uprock is danced with a partner and is more aggressive, involving fancy footwork, shuffles, hitting motions, and movements that mimic fighting. When there was an issue over , the two warlords of the feuding gangs would uprock, and whoever won this preliminary dance battle decided where the real fight would be. Because uprock's purpose was to moderate gang violence, it never crossed over into mainstream breaking as seen today, except for some specific moves adopted by breakers who use it as a variation for their toprock.|$|E

500|$|On her new album, {{entitled}} Stripped, Aguilera enlisted a {{wide range}} of songwriters and producers, including Alicia Keys, Scott Storch, and Linda Perry. Perry {{was one of the biggest}} influences to Aguilera during the making of the album. The singer stated, [...] "She taught me that imperfections are good and should be kept <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the heart. It makes things more believable and it's brave to share them with the world." [...] Keys was featured on the track [...] "Impossible", which was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York City. Another notable producer is Storch; he wrote and produced a total of seven songs from Stripped, including two singles. He stated that during the making of Stripped, Aguilera was one of his friends that he cared most. However, Storch did not produce her fifth studio album Back to Basics (2006), which started a feud between the two artists, which was stated by Aguilera in one of the track from Back to Basics, [...] "F.U.S.S.".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} heavily {{promoted}} and hyped, with some sources calling it [...] "much anticipated" [...] and [...] "long-awaited". In {{addition to the}} publicity about the coming-out of a character, [...] "There's Something About Marrying" [...] was discussed {{a lot in the}} media before its airing because of its gay marriage theme. The entertainment website MovieWeb predicted in October 2004 that the episode would become controversial when it aired because of the large children audience and [...] "also <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> {{at a time when many}} states are seeking to ban same-sex wedding ceremonies." [...] According to Knight Ridder, [...] "some conservative groups [...] growled in advance over the episode", but most pre-broadcast publicity was directed at the outing. Mark Pinsky, on the other hand, wrote in his book The Gospel According to The Simpsons that when the announcement that an episode of the show would focus on gay marriage was made, [...] "it stoked a debate that few issues and few television shows could." [...] Before its original airing, Pinsky was interviewed about the episode on ABC's World News Tonight, CNN, BBC Radio, and more, as the author of a book on religion in The Simpsons.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Guitar Hero {{was released}} on the PlayStation 2 in November 2005. Guitar Hero is notable <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> packaged with a controller peripheral modeled after a black Gibson SG guitar. Rather than a typical gamepad, this guitar controller is the primary input for the game. Playing the game with the guitar controller simulates playing an actual guitar, except it uses five colored [...] "fret buttons" [...] and a [...] "strum bar" [...] instead of frets and strings. The development of Guitar Hero was inspired by Konami's Guitar Freaks video game, which at the time, had not seen much exposure in the North American market; RedOctane, already selling guitar-shaped controllers for imported copies of GuitarFreaks, approached Harmonix about creating a game to use an entirely new Guitar controller. The concept {{was to have the}} gameplay of Amplitude with the visuals of Karaoke Revolution, both of which had been developed by Harmonix. [...] The game was met with critical acclaim and received numerous awards for its innovative guitar peripheral and its soundtrack, which comprised 47 playable rock songs (most of which were cover versions of popular songs from artists and bands from the 1960s through modern rock). Guitar Hero has sold nearly 1.5 million copies to date.|$|E

500|$|He {{characterized}} the song as [...] "advanced rhythm and blues", while its theremin and cello {{has been called}} the song's [...] "psychedelic ingredient". In his book discussing music of the counterculture era, James Perrone stated that the song represented a type of impressionistic psychedelia, in particular for its cello playing repeated bass notes and its theremin. Professor of American history John Robert Greene named [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] among examples of psychedelic or acid rock. Stebbins wrote that the song was [...] "replete with sunshine [...] psychedelia". Uncut wrote that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] was [...] "three minutes and thirty-six seconds of avant-garde pop". Mixdown described it as a [...] "masterpiece of avant-pop". Steve Valdez says that, like Pet Sounds, Brian was attempting a more experimental rock style. It has since been marketed as pop music, [...] "possibly <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> across relatively innocent compared with the hard-edged rock we have since come to know", according to historian Lorenzo Candelaria. Sound on Sound argues that the song [...] "has as many dramatic changes in mood as a piece of serious classical music lasting more than half an hour". Tom Roland of American Songwriter described the piece as being [...] "with its interlocking segments—a sort of pop version of the classical sonata, consisting of a series of musical movements". New York Magazine compared it to [...] "a fugue with a rhythmic beat". John Bush compared the track's fragmented cut-and-paste style to 1960s experimentalists such as William S. Burroughs.|$|E

2500|$|The {{theory of}} hybrid vigor {{suggests}} {{that as a}} group, dogs of varied ancestry will be healthier than their purebred counterparts. In purebred dogs, intentionally breeding dogs of very similar appearance over several generations produces animals that carry {{many of the same}} alleles, some of which are detrimental. If the founding population for the breed was small, then the genetic diversity of that particular breed may be small for quite some time. In essence, when humans select certain dogs for new breeds, they artificially isolate that group of genes and cause more copies of that gene to be made than might have otherwise occurred in nature. Initially, the population will be more fragile {{because of the lack of}} genetic diversity. If the dog breed is popular, and the line continues, over hundreds of years diversity will increase due to mutations and occasional out-breeding; like an island with a few new birds—they will diversify. This is why some of the very [...] "old" [...] breeds are more stable. The problem is when certain traits found in the breed standard are associated with genetic disorders. Then, the artificial selective force favors the duplication of the genetic disorder, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> with a desired physical trait. The genetic health of hybrids tends to be higher. Healthy traits have been lost in many purebred dogs lines because many breeders of showdogs are more interested in conformation – the physical attributes of the dogs in relation to the breed standard – than in the health and working temperament for which the dog was originally bred.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the second}} round of talks, a day before Croitoru's nomination, Băsescu noted: [...] "Some parties have {{proposed}} Klaus Iohannis. I would like you to know that I have not rejected the possibility for him to become Prime Minister in the condition that my options would be directed towards other [...] solutions. But I have rejected such a proposal <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from PSD or another party [...] ", referring to his alleged constraint to consider a proposal of the largest party (PDL), constraint disputed by the other parties. The opposition criticized the President for not designating Iohannis. Social Democrat leader Mircea Geoană accused Băsescu of trying to influence the upcoming presidential elections by having them organised by a sympathetic government. Crin Antonescu, the leader of the National Liberals, vowed his party would derail other nominations but Iohannis'. After the nomination of Croitoru, Antonescu, a candidate in the presidential election, stated that he would nominate Iohannis as Prime Minister if elected President. Three days later, on 18 October Geoană suggested Antonescu was trying to use Iohannis as an [...] "electoral agent" [...] for Antonescu's bid for president. In response, Antonescu told the press that Iohannis [...] "is not the type of person that would let himself being used". Geoană and PSD leadership has held a second meeting with Iohannis in Bucharest in the evening of 18 October. UDMR, which the previous day announced it would also attend, declared in the morning that all their leaders are not in the city. PNL was present at the meeting by lower level representatives, after Antonescu announced in the morning he is on campaign in Cluj-Napoca. On 21 October the Parliament adopted with 252 votes for (of PSD, PNL, UDMR and minorities groups) and 2 against a declaration requesting the President to nominate Iohannis as Prime Minister.|$|E
