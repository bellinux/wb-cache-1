25|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>oranges</b> are {{a natural}} {{mutation}} of C. sinensis, although today {{the majority of}} them are hybrids. High concentrations of anthocyanin give the rind, flesh, and juice of the fruit their characteristic dark red color. <b>Blood</b> <b>oranges</b> were first discovered and cultivated in Sicily in the fifteenth century. Since then they have spread worldwide, but are grown especially in Spain and Italy under the names of sanguina and sanguinella, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>oranges</b> {{may have}} {{originated}} in either China or the southern Mediterranean, {{where they have}} been grown since the 18th century. [...] They are now the primary orange grown in Italy. [...] The anthocyanins which give the orange its distinct maroon color will only develop when temperatures are low at night, as during the Mediterranean fall and winter. [...] <b>Blood</b> <b>oranges</b> cultivated in the United States are in season from December to March (Texas), and from November to May (California).|$|E

2500|$|Some {{blood orange}} juice may be {{somewhat}} tart, while other kinds are sweet [...] while retaining the characteristic blood orange taste. The oranges {{can also be used}} to create marmalade, and the zest can be used for baking. A popular Sicilian winter salad is made with sliced <b>blood</b> <b>oranges,</b> sliced bulb fennel, and olive oil. The oranges have also been used to create gelato, sorbet, and Italian soda. <b>Blood</b> <b>oranges</b> are also popular in vinaigrette-style dressings, and are sometimes used to flavor niche-market beer.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>oranges</b> are {{a source}} of vitamin C like all citrus fruits. A {{medium-sized}} (154-g) orange also provides 28% of the recommended daily intake of dietary fiber. [...] Oranges can also be a valuable source of folate, calcium, and thiamine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distinctive}} dark flesh {{color is}} due to the presence of anthocyanins, a family of antioxidant pigments common to many flowers and fruit, but uncommon in citrus fruits. Chrysanthemin (cyanidin 3-O-glucoside) is the main compound found in red oranges. The flesh develops its characteristic maroon color when the fruit develops with low temperatures during the night. [...] Sometimes, dark coloring is seen on the exterior of the rind, as well, depending on the variety of blood orange. The skin can be tougher and harder to peel than that of other oranges. <b>Blood</b> <b>oranges</b> have a unique flavor profile compared to other oranges, being distinctly raspberry-like in addition to the usual citrus notes.|$|E

2500|$|These early styles had {{coalesced}} into a genre by {{the time}} the Illinois group Uncle Tupelo released their influential debut album No Depression in 1990. The album is widely credited as being the first [...] "alternative country" [...] album, and inspired the name of No Depression magazine, which exclusively covered the new genre. Following Uncle Tupelo's disbanding in 1994, its members formed two significant bands in genre: Wilco and Son Volt. Other acts who became prominent in the genre during the 1990s and 2000s included The Bottle Rockets, The Handsome Family, Blue Mountain, Robbie Fulks, <b>Blood</b> <b>Oranges,</b> Bright Eyes, Drive-By Truckers, Old 97's and Whiskeytown, whose lead singer Ryan Adams later had a successful solo-career. Some alt-country songs have been crossover hits to mainstream country radio, including Lucinda Williams' [...] "Passionate Kisses", which was a hit for Mary Chapin Carpenter in 1993, and Ryan Adams's [...] "When The Stars Go Blue," [...] which was a hit for Tim McGraw in 2007.|$|E
60|$|In {{the last}} chapter I have {{attempted}} to suggest a background of the battlemented walls with the low gates and narrow windows which seem to relieve the liveliest of the coloured groups against the neutral tints of the North, and how this was intensified when the neutral tints were touched with the positive hue of snow. In the same merely impressionist spirit I would here attempt to sketch some of the externals of the actors in such a scene, though {{it is hard to}} do justice to such a picture even in the superficial matter of the picturesque. Indeed it is hard to be sufficiently superficial; for in the East nearly every external is a symbol. The greater part of it is the gorgeous rag-heap of Arabian humanity, and even about that one could lecture on almost every coloured rag. We hear much of the gaudy colours of the East; but the most striking thing about them is that they are delicate colours. It is rare to see a red that is merely like a pillar-box, or a blue that is Reckitt's blue; the red is sure to have the enrichment of tawny wine or <b>blood</b> <b>oranges,</b> and the blue of peacocks or the sea. In short these people are artistic in the sense that used to be called aesthetic; and it is a nameless instinct that preserves these nameless tints. Like all such instincts, it can be blunted by a bullying rationalism; like all such children, these people do not know why they prefer the better, and can therefore be persuaded by sophists that they prefer the worst. But there are other elements emerging from the coloured crowd, which are more significant, and therefore more stubborn. A stranger entirely ignorant of that world would feel something like a chill to the blood when he first saw the black figures of the veiled Moslem women, sinister figures without faces. It is as if in that world every woman were a widow. When he realised that these were not the masked mutes at a very grisly funeral, but merely ladies literally obeying a convention of wearing veils in public, he would probably have a reaction of laughter. He would be disposed to say flippantly that it must be, a dull life, not only for the women but the men; and that a man might well want five wives if he had to marry them before he could even look at them. But he will be wise not to be satisfied with such flippancy, for the complete veiling of the Moslem women of Jerusalem, though not a finer thing than the freedom of the Christian woman of Bethlehem, is almost certainly a finer thing than the more coquettish compromise of the other Moslem women of Cairo. It simply means that the Moslem religion is here more sincerely observed; and this in turn is part of something that a sympathetic person will soon feel in Jerusalem, if he has come from these more commercial cities of the East; a spiritual tone decidedly more delicate and dignified, like the clear air about the mountain city. Whatever the human vices involved, it is not altogether for nothing that this is the holy town of three great religions. When all is said, he will feel that there are some tricks that could not be played, some trades that could not be plied, some shops that could not be opened, within a stone's throw of the Sepulchre. This indefinable seriousness has its own fantasies of fanaticism or formalism; but if these are vices they are not vulgarities. There is no stronger example of this than the real Jews of Jerusalem, especially those from the ghettoes of eastern Europe. They can be immediately picked out by the peculiar wisps of hair worn {{on each side of the}} face, like something between curls and whiskers. Sometimes they look strangely effeminate, like some rococo burlesque of the ringlets of an Early Victorian woman. Sometimes they look considerably more like the horns of a devil; and one need not be an Anti-Semite to say that the face is often made to match. But though they may be ugly, or even horrible, they are not vulgar like the Jews at Brighton; they trail behind them too many primeval traditions and laborious loyalties, along with their grand though often greasy robes of bronze or purple velvet. They often wear on their heads that odd turban of fur worn by the Rabbis in the pictures of Rembrandt. And indeed that great name is not irrelevant; for the whole truth at the back of Zionism is in the difference between the picture of a Jew by Rembrandt and a picture of a Jew by Sargent. For Rembrandt the Rabbi was, in a special and double sense, a distinguished figure. He was something distinct from the world of the artist, who drew a Rabbi as he would a Brahmin. But Sargent had to treat his sitters as solid citizens of England or America; and consequently his pictures are direct provocations to a pogrom. But the light that Rembrandt loved falls not irreverently on the strange hairy haloes that can still be seen on the shaven heads of the Jews of Jerusalem. And I should be sorry for any pogrom that brought down any of their grey wisps or whiskers in sorrow to the grave.|$|E
