5000|$|The Banbury mixer is a {{brand of}} {{internal}} <b>batch</b> <b>mixer,</b> named for inventor Fernley H. Banbury. The [...] "Banbury" [...] trademark is owned by Farrel Corporation. Internal batch mixers such as the Banbury mixer are used for mixing or compounding rubber and plastics. The original design dates back to 1916. The mixer consists of two rotating spiral-shaped blades encased in segments of cylindrical housings. These intersect so as to leave a ridge between the blades. The blades may be cored for circulation of heating or cooling. Its invention resulted in major labor and capital savings in the tire industry, doing away with the initial step of roller-milling rubber. It is also used for reinforcing fillers in a resin system.|$|E
