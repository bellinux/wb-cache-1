40|$|Background: Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) lesions {{are often}} {{observed}} in the humeral capitellum both in young <b>baseball</b> <b>players</b> and gymnasts. It is generally believed that capitellar OCD in <b>baseball</b> <b>players</b> {{can be seen on}} an anteroposterior (AP) radiograph with the elbow in 45 ° of flexion. However, the mechanism of injury seems to be different in <b>baseball</b> <b>players</b> and gymnasts. Repetitive valgus overload with the elbow in flexion {{is believed to be the}} cause of capitellar OCD lesions in <b>baseball</b> <b>players,</b> whereas weightbearing with the elbow in extension may be the cause of OCD in gymnasts. Purpose: To determine the difference in capitellar OCD location between <b>baseball</b> <b>players</b> and gymnasts and to propose the optimal AP radiographic angle of the elbow for visualization of early-stage OCD lesions in adolescent gymnasts. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Subjects consisted of 95 <b>baseball</b> <b>players</b> (95 elbows) and 21 gymnasts (24 elbows) with a mean age of 13. 7 years (range, 11 - 18 years). To localize the lesion, inclination of the affected area in the humeral capitellum against the humeral axis was investigated using sagittal computed tomography images of the elbow. The inclination angle was defined as the angle between the long axis of the humerus and the line perpendicular to a line that connected the anterior and posterior margin of the lesion. The inclination angle in each group was compared and statistically analyzed. Results: The mean inclination angle was 57. 6 ° ± 10. 7 ° in <b>baseball</b> <b>players</b> and 28. 0 ° ± 10. 7 ° in gymnasts. Capitellar OCD lesions were located more anterior in <b>baseball</b> <b>players</b> when compared with gymnasts (P <. 01). Conclusion: Due to differences in applied stress, capitellar OCD lesions in <b>baseball</b> <b>players</b> were located more anteriorly compared with those seen in gymnasts. Therefore, although AP radiographs with the elbow in 45 ° of flexion are optimal for detecting OCD lesions in <b>baseball</b> <b>players,</b> radiographs with less elbow flexion or full extension are more useful in gymnasts, especially in early-stage OCD...|$|R
