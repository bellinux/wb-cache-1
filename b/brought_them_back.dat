Salvador Dalí, John Lindsay, Leland Hayward and Dorothy Kilgallen often dined {{at the restaurant}} in its early years. The journalist and broadcaster Walter Cronkite was a regular visitor to La Caravelle and enjoyed eating pike quenelles in lobster cream sauce. Other frequent visitors included the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Marlene Dietrich.|$|E

The wounded were taken to Buna by Humphreys. Japanese aircraft attacked the beach at 15:30. An ammunition dump exploded and a fuel dump was set on fire. The 532nd EBSR lost one man killed and 12 wounded.|$|E
5|$|According to Robert van Voren, {{although}} for several years, {{especially after the}} implosion of the USSR and during {{the first years of}} Boris Yeltsin's rule, the positions of the Soviet psychiatric leaders were in jeopardy, now one can firmly conclude that they succeeded in riding out the storm and retaining their powerful positions. They also succeeded in avoiding an inflow of modern concepts of delivering mental health care and a fundamental change in the structure of psychiatric services in Russia. On the whole, in Russia, the impact of mental health reformers has been the least. Even the reform efforts made in such places as St. Petersburg, Tomsk, and Kaliningrad have faltered or were encapsulated as centrist policies under Putin <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> under control.|$|E

5|$|During the November 11, 2006, {{game against}} Kansas State, McCoy {{suffered}} a stinger shoulder injury while rushing {{for a touchdown}} on the opening drive against Kansas State. Snead came in and played {{the remainder of the}} game. The Longhorns fell behind by as much as 21 points before Snead <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> to within 3, finally falling in an upset by the Wildcats 45–42. There was speculation that Snead might be the starter for the final regular season game, because it was unknown whether McCoy would return for the Longhorns season closer against rival Texas A on November 24, 2006. However, McCoy was cleared to play the game against the Aggies.|$|E
5|$|On 9 November, Fraser {{contacted}} Whitlam {{and invited}} him to negotiations with the Coalition aimed at settling the dispute. Whitlam agreed, and a meeting was set for 9am on Tuesday 11 November, at Parliament House. That Tuesday was also the deadline for an election to be called {{if it were to}} be held before Christmas. Both Government and Opposition leaders were in Melbourne on the night of 10 November for the Lord Mayor's banquet. To ensure the Opposition leaders could reach Canberra in time for the meeting, Whitlam <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> in his VIP aircraft, which arrived in Canberra at midnight.|$|E
5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 27 February, 'C' Company, 2nd Parachute Battalion, {{under the command of}} Major John Frost, parachuted into France {{a few miles from the}} installation. The force then {{proceeded}} to assault the villa in which the radar equipment was kept, killing several members of the German garrison and capturing the installation after a brief fire-fight. A technician that had come with the force partially dismantled the Würzburg radar array and removed several key pieces to take back to Britain, the raiding force then retreated to the evacuation beach. The detachment assigned to clear the beach had failed to do so, however, and another brief fire-fight was required to eliminate the Germans guarding the beach. The raiding force was then picked up by a small number of landing craft and transferred to several Motor Gun Boats which <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> to Britain. The raid was entirely successful. The airborne troops suffered only a few casualties, and the pieces of the radar they brought back, along with a German radar technician, allowed British scientists to understand German advances in radar and to create counter-measures to neutralise those advances.|$|E
5|$|The Sound Four do {{not become}} a {{prominent}} {{part of the story}} until sent by their leader to escort Sasuke Uchiha to him. Even with Kimimaro joining the group to ensure Sasuke's passage to Orochimaru, the Sound Five all died in the process: Jirobo and Kidomaru killed in their respective fights against Chōji Akimichi and Neji Hyūga, Sakon and Ukon taken out by Kankuro as they nearly kill Kiba Inuzuka, Tayuya indirectly killed by Temari as she had the upper hand on Shikamaru Nara, and Kimimaro succumbed to his unknown illness {{in the midst of his}} battle against Gaara and Rock Lee. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kimimaro is reanimated by Kabuto Yakushi as a pawn to battle against the Allied Shinobi Forces. In the anime adaptation, unaware that Kabuto <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> instead of Orochimaru, the Sound Four were also reanimated and were allowed to act on their impulse for revenge against the members of the Sasuke Retrieval group before being defeated. It was also at the time of the war's climax that Kabuto reveals that he assimilated the Sound Five's DNA to access their abilities.|$|E

25|$|The Brooklyn Bridegrooms used checked uniforms in 1889, and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> in 1907 (as the Superbas) and 1916–1917 (as the Robins). Satin uniforms were {{developed}} by several teams including the Brooklyn Dodgers for night games, as the sheen of the fabric was more reflective and thus easier to see. Pinstripes were commonly worn on the uniforms of the New York Yankees. Legend had it that the stripes were adopted to make Babe Ruth look slimmer, but since the Yankees had already been wearing pinstripes {{a few years before}} Ruth played for them in 1920, the legend was found to be a myth. The Yankees' pinstripes on their home uniforms soon became a team symbol.|$|E
25|$|Slacum was {{an agent}} of the U.S. President; he helped put {{together}} a joint venture among the men to purchase cattle. In January 1837, Young was selected {{as the leader of the}} Willamette Cattle Company. He traveled to California on the Loriot (assisted by Slacum). After purchasing 630 head of cattle, he <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> along the Siskiyou Trail. Previously, the HBC had owned all the cattle in the Willamette Valley and rented animals to settlers. Accompanying Young on the cattle drive were Philip Leget Edwards, Calvin Tibbets, John Turner, William J. Bailey, George Gay, Lawrence Carmichael, Pierre De Puis, B. Williams, and Emert Ergnette. During the drive Gay and Bailey murdered a native boy, rationalising it as justice for the attack several years earlier by the Rogue River Indians on Young’s group.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to large animals, they also ate very {{large quantities of}} small mammals and birds. 80% of the bones found in the caves are those of rabbits, {{which would have been}} abundant in the coastal sand dunes. The Neanderthals exploited Gibraltar's location as one of Europe's focal points for migratory birds, by catching and eating them in large quantities. 145 species, representing a quarter of Europe's total, are represented in the finds from the caves, making them the richest sites for fossil bird remains anywhere in Europe. They also ate tortoises and even monk seals, suggesting that they might have hunted or at least scavenged marine mammals. They certainly ate shellfish in large quantities; many mussel shells have been found in the caves, indicating that the Neanderthals harvested them from the seashore and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> over a considerable distance, perhaps carrying them in bags made from animal skins.|$|E

That--or else one pinch of salt on their tails. It did not matter which. One by one he must bring <b>them</b> <b>back,</b> driving <b>them</b> by spell and curse to the cattle-boat of the ferry. And until he had caught and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> all <b>back</b> he might never return again to the warmth and comfort of his accustomed life. That was his sentence and punishment.

Not all of their attempts to leave were successful. Some had things that kept hold on them in the drug world and hurt their success in legitimate ventures. Their exits from the drug world then tended to be temporary and easily broken; periods of relapse into dealing occurred. This tended to be a cycle every time an attempt to exit was made; however, each subsequent attempt <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> further <b>back</b> into society. Their reattachment to society had its own set of problems due to their long absence from the mainstream economy.|$|R
25|$|The numbers {{involved}} in this cottage industry were considerable: a rooftop bleacher could hold up to 80 people, with 18 more in the bay window of the front bedroom and more even on the porch roof. Viewers on the block could number up to several thousand for important games. Housewives served up refreshments for sale and children scurried to the hot dog vendors on the street, bought dogs for a nickel, and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> to sell for a dime. With so much money on the line, the business got organized and formalized very quickly; homeowners were soon squeezed for bribes by city amusement tax collectors, and city police collected commissions for collaring and herding fans from the sidewalk into particular homes. By 1929, the extra income from the rooftop bleachers actually caused real estate values to climb on the 2700 block of N. 20th Street.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning the}} toss and {{deciding}} to bat against Canada, Bermuda scored 206/8 from their 50 overs: an innings that was saved from collapse in large {{due to the}} partnerships between captain Irving Romaine and Saleem Mukuddem, for 57, as well as Lionel Cann and Delyone Borden, for 38. Cann top scored for Bermuda again, this time for 42 – notably off just 25 balls, including five sixes. Come the Canadian innings, opener Abdool Samad took to the crease in similar fashion to Nafees the day before. His 83 from 86 took Canada to 135/3, and {{well on the way}} to victory. Delyone Borden's spin bowling <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> into the game – taking 4 wickets for just 33 runs, and reducing Canada to 179/6; but the tail end of Canada's batting order got them the 207 runs they required – with 6 overs to spare and losing just 1 more wicket – to finish on 207/7.|$|E
