5|$|Despite limited {{information}} about its service routes and construction, the Nathan F. Cobb {{was the subject}} of two separate New York Times articles during its short career. One article reported the wreck the day after it occurred, the other article came from 20 June 1892 and chronicled a disturbance between mates. The Cobb was still in tow only three miles outside Mobile Bay, beginning its route from Mobile, Alabama to New York, when mate Henry Shaffer jumped over board to avoid a beating. Another mate, J. Trott had already used a <b>belaying</b> <b>pin</b> to half kill another seaman on the schooner and Shaffer was fearful for his life. Shaffer began swimming towards a nearby light house and was picked up nearly five miles from where he jumped over board. The captain of the towboat reported that Captain Cookson of the Cobb, mentioned incidentally they had lost a crewman. Both Cookson and Trott already had pending charges against them for cruelty and marooning of sailors, stemming from an incident in May 1891 at Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] {{answered}} Larry, {{and ran off}} to get a pair of handcuffs while Tom Grandon stationed himself beside Ostag Semmel, <b>belaying</b> <b>pin</b> in hand.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} he {{advanced}} upon me. I {{saw that he}} had a large wooden <b>belaying</b> <b>pin</b> in his hand, and I retreated as far as possible.|$|E
50|$|Shipwrights {{make the}} ships which sail the seas, {{as well as}} bludgeons (such as ropes and <b>belaying</b> <b>pins)</b> for rumbling.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the White Act of 1898 [...] "'bully mates'...had {{relied on}} their fists, <b>belaying</b> <b>pins,</b> and handspikes to enforce discipline." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] was the reply, {{and then}} all of the [...] "boys {{procured}} <b>belaying</b> <b>pins</b> or whatever was handy, with which to ward off a possible attack.|$|R
60|$|A {{moment later}} a heavy <b>belaying</b> <b>pin</b> {{fell on the}} head, and it disappeared. Then {{there was a loud}} {{explosion}} as an arquebus was fired, the bullet crashing through the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure I go," [...] {{answered}} Semmel, with a toss of his head, and he slouched {{toward the}} stern. His manner was so aggressive that Larry {{picked up a}} <b>belaying</b> <b>pin</b> before following him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure I sees somethin' movin' on the wather," [...] exclaimed Mrs Lynch, who, {{during the}} occurrences just described, had {{held on to}} a <b>belaying</b> <b>pin</b> with the {{tenacity}} and strength of an octopus.|$|E
60|$|One watch was below, {{the men of}} {{the other}} were for the most part {{gathered}} aft, and lashed to <b>belaying</b> <b>pins.</b> Fairclough was standing near the wheel. With some difficulty, Harry made his way to him.|$|R
60|$|The old man settled {{it that he}} and Jerry should arm {{themselves}} with <b>belaying</b> <b>pins,</b> and the two muskets he brought back from Benedict, together with our old fowling-piece, was distributed among the rest of us.|$|R
5000|$|Although a fife rail {{is a kind}} of pin rail, {{the term}} [...] "pin rail" [...] is often used to {{specifically}} denote those rails containing <b>belaying</b> <b>pins</b> that are attached to the hull. Unlike these, fife rails are freestanding.|$|R
60|$|And {{the mate}} cursed him, and swore that Kanaka was for no {{use in the}} world, and if he got started after him with a <b>belaying</b> <b>pin,</b> {{it would be a}} cold day for Keola.|$|E
60|$|The two men {{had their}} hands tied behind them, {{but it was an}} easy matter for Larry to {{liberate}} them. Then each provided himself with a <b>belaying</b> <b>pin,</b> and all three of the party stole to the deck.|$|E
60|$|He got no further, {{for raising}} his <b>belaying</b> <b>pin,</b> Vincent brought {{it down on}} the mutineer's head. Groot had been the one to lame the boatswain's back and the latter had not {{forgotten}} it. Over went the fellow and sank down as if dead.|$|E
5000|$|... "According to {{the story}} of the crew, they were put to {{unnecessarily}} hard and dangerous work, forced by brutal beatings with brass knuckles, <b>belaying</b> <b>pins</b> and the like. One grievance was that they were put over the side on stagings while the ship was going ten knots and rolling and pitching heavily. Two men were lost overboard." ...|$|R
60|$|A small stay sail was {{got out and}} hoisted, and {{the helm}} was put down a little. Though still running at but a slight angle before the wind, the {{pressure}} was now sufficient to lay her down to her gunwale. The crew gathered under shelter of the weather bulwark, holding on by <b>belaying</b> <b>pins</b> and stanchions.|$|R
50|$|The <b>belaying</b> <b>pins</b> and deadeyes aboard USS Constitution {{and many}} other sailing ships were made from lignum vitae. Due to its density and natural oils, they rarely require replacement, despite the {{severity}} of typical marine weathering conditions, and also resisted jamming in their mortise holes. The sheaves of blocks on sailing vessels were made of lignum vitae until the introduction of modern synthetics.|$|R
6000|$|... "We set her by {{the compass}} at six o'clock, sir, and she has not varied her bearing, as far as from one <b>belaying</b> <b>pin</b> to another, in three hours; but her hull rises fast: you can now make out her ports, and at {{daylight}} {{the bottom of her}} courses dipped." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the second}} day after the {{wounding}} of Black Michael, Clayton came on deck {{just in time to}} see the limp body of one of the crew being carried below by four of his fellows while the first mate, a heavy <b>belaying</b> <b>pin</b> in his hand, stood glowering at the little party of sullen sailors.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, the Governor was wrong," [...] he announced, {{with a short}} laugh. [...] "I did kill McSweeny. I did get the {{watchman}} drunk that night. I beat McSweeny {{to death}} in his bunk. I used the iron <b>belaying</b> <b>pin</b> {{that appeared in the}} evidence. He never had a chance. I beat him to a jelly. Do you want the details?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{reception}} of other critics was more positive. In the US, The New York Times Book Review noted the author's [...] "delightful subtlety", and his [...] "easy {{command of the}} philosophical, political, sensual and social temper of the times that flavors a rich entertainment", while Kirkus Reviews said that the book was [...] "A welcome treat for sea hounds who care more for <b>belaying</b> <b>pins</b> than ravaged bodices below decks".|$|R
2500|$|... "Gordon {{had it in}} {{his mind}} {{to set the record}} with this voyage around the Horn and was driving his new crew hard, and soon had a mutiny with [...] "all hands refusing duty." [...] <b>Belaying</b> <b>pins</b> and hand spikes were soon flying, and the Memnon was forced to put into Montevideo, where Gordon {{discharged}} the troublemakers. He took on a new crew before proceeding on the Memnon's [...] record breaking voyage of 123 sailing days from Sandy Hook, arriving in San Francisco Bay on August 28, 1849." ...|$|R
50|$|A pin rail, {{originally}} a wood beam, is typically a large-diameter round steel tube with vertical through-holes that accept <b>belaying</b> <b>pins</b> {{used in a}} hemp rigging system. Depending on the pin rail design, the pins may be removable or permanently fixed to the rail. Pin rails are typically installed permanently at the onstage edge of the fly gallery(ies), extending from the proscenium wall to upstage wall, sometimes in a stacked (rail over rail) arrangement. Mobile pin rails may also be used and are bolted down to the stage deck where needed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{you come}} up here, you maybe git killed," [...] put in Ostag Semmel. [...] "You stay down dare, you hear?" [...] And then, as the captain started to mount the stairs, he threw down a <b>belaying</b> <b>pin.</b> In the semi-darkness the captain {{did not see the}} object, and it struck him {{on the top of the}} head, {{rendering}} him partly unconscious.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Getting drunk. Peters {{can hold}} more grog {{than any man}} I ever saw; he keeps right side up, but is as savage as a norther, and makes things lively all round. I've seen him knock a fellow down with a <b>belaying</b> <b>pin,</b> and couldn't lend a hand. Better luck now, I hope.' And Emil frowned as if he already trod the quarter-deck, lord of all he surveyed.|$|E
60|$|The captain welcomed them on deck in a {{scene of}} unusual character. He himself had a {{revolver}} in one hand, and a <b>belaying</b> <b>pin</b> in the other; he had been quelling, by the tranquillising methods of Captain Kettle, a mutiny caused by the terror of the crew. The sailors had attempted to leap overboard in the alarm caused by {{the invasion of the}} Berbalangs.|$|E
60|$|The missionary {{needed no}} second bidding. He went below to rouse and assist Lucy, while Bluenose, Guy, {{and the rest}} of those on board, held on to ropes, and <b>belaying</b> <b>pins,</b> and awaited the result in silence. The noise of the wind, and the peals of thunder that seemed to tear the heavens asunder, {{rendered}} conversation impossible. They all felt that a few minutes would decide whether this terrible rush landward would terminate in safety or disaster, and they knew that everything, as far as human skill had to do with it, depended on Bax.|$|R
5000|$|A fife rail is {{a design}} {{element of a}} European-style sailing ship used to belay the ship's halyards {{at the base of}} a mast. When {{surrounding}} a mast, a fife rail is sometimes referred to specifically by the name of the mast with which it is associated: the main fife rail surrounds the main mast; the mizzen fife rail surrounds the mizzen mast, etc. It is one of a dozen or so types of [...] "rails" [...] often found on such ships. [...] Fife rails are typically horizontal strips of either wood or iron and are joined and fitted to the tops of a series of stanchions. The term apparently derives from the location where the ship's fifer would sit and play his fife at heaving of the ship's anchor.A fife rail surrounding a ship's mast will contain a series of <b>belaying</b> <b>pins</b> corresponding to the sails on that mast which they belay. A mast will either have a single horseshoe-shaped fife rail surround the base of the mast on the fore, starboard, and port sides, a single straight rail directly before or directly behind the mast, or a set of two fife rails, one on each side (fore and aft) of the mast.Each sail associated with a given fife rail will have several corresponding <b>belaying</b> <b>pins</b> set into that rail.|$|R
60|$|Very {{carefully}} {{they passed}} the boat alongside, taking pains to prevent her touching. When they reached the bow the captain grasped the cable, and {{with two or three}} cuts with the knife severed it. Then the boat was pushed off from the ship and gently paddled away to the full length of the line. Another half hour and they again drew alongside, and noiselessly climbed on to the deck. The men armed themselves with <b>belaying</b> <b>pins,</b> and Ned took his pistols from the belt beneath his jacket. Then they quietly approached the door. There was a light burning within.|$|R
6000|$|... "By George, I {{never thought}} of it. Of course it's Christmas Day. We'll have many more of them, too. And {{do you know what}} I've been thinking? What a confounded shame we're done out of our Christmas dinner. Wait till I lay hands on Dettmar. I'll take it out of him. And it won't be with an iron <b>belaying</b> <b>pin</b> either, Just two bunches of naked knuckles, that's all." ...|$|E
60|$|The Fuwalda was no {{exception}} to the rule. Her officers were swarthy bullies, hating and hated by their crew. The captain, while a competent seaman, was a brute in his treatment of his men. He knew, {{or at least he}} used, but two arguments in his dealings with them--a <b>belaying</b> <b>pin</b> and a revolver--nor is it likely that the motley aggregation he signed would have understood aught else.|$|E
6000|$|... "I deserted {{the ship}} at Liverpool in {{consequence}} of my ill-treatment {{by the second}} mate,--a man selected for his position by reason of his superior physical strength and recognized brutality. I have been since told that {{he graduated from the}} state prison. On the second day out I saw him strike a man senseless with a <b>belaying</b> <b>pin</b> for some trifling breach of discipline. I saw him repeatedly beat and kick sick men--" ...|$|E
5000|$|Rumble {{is similar}} to Puzzle Bobble; players launch multicolored balls {{in order to make}} groups of three or more. However, players may also [...] "charge" [...] balls up to make combos, adding to the {{opposing}} player's field. As they can for sword fighting, players can purchase weapons to enhance their rumbling. Players start with their only hands, but can purchase bludgeons which send different, more complex patterns of balls to their opponents. Bludgeons include gaffs, brass knuckles, hammers, <b>belaying</b> <b>pins,</b> and chains, among others. There is a variant of Rumble called Boxing that is played with only one ball instead of the usual two, but is otherwise identical.|$|R
60|$|The Captain {{told his}} men {{that the only}} thing to be done was to keep the fellows on that {{approaching}} steamer from boarding the Monterey whether they tried to do so by what might look like fair means or by foul means. All the firearms of every kind which could be collected were distributed around among those who it was thought could best use them, {{while the rest of the}} men were armed with <b>belaying</b> <b>pins,</b> handspikes, hatchets, axes, or anything with which a blow could be struck, and they were ranged along the bulwarks on each side of the ship from bow to stern.|$|R
50|$|This {{machinery}} {{was planned}} to cut timber for the numerous smaller parts used in shipbuilding, especially joinery, which {{had previously been}} cut by hand, such as components for tables and benches, as well as small turned goods like <b>belaying</b> <b>pins.</b> There is evidence that he had developed a rotary wood-planing machine but details of this are obscure. There is also evidence that the complex housed a pipe boring machine, whereby straight elm trees were bored out for pump dales. These could be up to 40 ft long and were fitted through the decks of a vessel to pump seawater to the deck. There was a machine for making treenails—long wooden dowels used for fixing wooden parts of a ship together.|$|R
