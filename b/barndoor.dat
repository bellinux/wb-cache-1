5|$|The <b>barndoor</b> skate {{is one of}} five skates in the Gulf of Maine {{that has}} {{commercial}} value, but of those, the species that are most frequently targeted are the winter skate (Leucoraja ocellata) and the thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata). The <b>barndoor</b> skate is most commonly considered by-catch by commercial trawlers operating in the northwestern Atlantic that target other commercially valuable species of fish using bottom trawling. When harvested, the flesh of the <b>barndoor</b> skate is used as bait, fish meal, pet food, and the meat from its wings is sold for human consumption. Since 1981, landings of skates have increased substantially, partly in response to increased demand for lobster bait, and more significantly, to the increased export market for skate wings. Currently, commercial retention and sale of <b>barndoor</b> skate is prohibited in the United States.|$|E

500|$|The <b>barndoor</b> skate is a flat-bodied {{fish with}} a large, disk-like body with sharply angled corners and a pointed snout. Its {{pectoral}} fins have evolved into broad, flat, wing-like appendages used to propel the fish through the water. These fins have a concave front edge with rounded posterior corners. Like sharks, {{it has a}} boneless skeleton made of cartilage, a tough, elastic substance composed of collagenous and/or elastic fibers, cells, and a firm, gel-like substance called the matrix. It has slot-like body openings called gill slits {{on the underside of}} the body beneath the pectoral fins that lead from the gills. The dorsal fins are close together and far removed from the tail. It has two eyes on its dorsal surface, located approximately [...] apart.|$|E

It is found on various types of ocean bottoms including soft muddy, sandy, and rocky bottoms. It can be found from the shoreline to depths of up to , although it is most commonly found at depths of less than [...] It inhabits waters in a broad range of temperatures, from just above freezing to [...] It appears to move closer to shore in the autumn and further out to sea in the warmer months. It tolerates brackish water where the salinity is as low as 21 to 24parts per thousand, but it prefers salinity between 31 and 35 parts per thousand. It is believed to not exhibit any north-south migratory patterns.|$|E

Perez asked Escovedo to dinner, Enriquez waited at table, and in each cup of wine that Escovedo drank, he, rather homoeopathically, put 'a nutshellful of the water.' Escovedo was no more poisoned than the cock of the earlier experiment. 'It was ascertained that the beverage produced no effect whatever.' ...|$|E
60|$|There is {{not much}} {{apparent}} resemblance between a <b>barndoor</b> Fowl and the Dog who protects the farm-yard. Nevertheless the student of development finds, {{not only that the}} chick commences its existence as an egg, primarily identical, in all essential respects, with that of the Dog, but that the yelk of this egg undergoes division--that the primitive groove arises, and that the contiguous parts of the germ are fashioned, by precisely similar methods, into a young chick, which, at one stage of its existence, is so like the nascent Dog, that ordinary inspection would hardly distinguish the two.|$|E

Presently they heard the muffled tread of a horse, and the farmer rode up to the <b>barndoor.</b> When he had dismounted he came close to Tess, and remained looking musingly at the side of her face. She had not turned at first, but his fixed attitude led her to look round, when she perceived that her employer was the native of Trantridge from whom she had taken flight on the high-road because of his allusion to her history.|$|E
6000|$|THE {{circumstances}} {{announced in}} {{the conclusion of the}} last chapter will account for the ready and cheerful reception of the Marquis of A---- and the Master of Ravenswood in the village of Wolf's Hope. In fact, Caleb had no sooner announced the conflagration of the tower than the whole hamlet were upon foot to hasten to extinguish the flames. And although that zealous adherent diverted their zeal by intimating the formidable contents of the subterranean apartments, yet the check only turned their assiduity into another direction. Never had there been such slaughtering of capons, and fat geese, and <b>barndoor</b> fowls; never such boiling of [...] "reested" [...] hams; never such making of car-cakes and sweet scones, Selkirk bannocks, cookies, and petticoat-tails--delicacies little known to the present generation. Never had there been such a tapping of barrels, and such uncorking of greybeards, in the village of Wolf's Hope. All the inferior houses were thrown open for the reception of the Marquis's dependants, who came, it was thought, as precursors of the shower of preferment which hereafter was to leave the rest of Scotland dry, in order to distil its rich dews on the village of Wolf's Hope under Lammermoor. The minister put in his claim to have the guests of distinction lodged at the manse, having his eye, it was thought, upon a neighbouring preferment, where the incumbent was sickly; but Mr. Balderstone destined that honour to the cooper, his wife, and wife's mother, who danced for joy at the preferences thus assigned them.|$|E
