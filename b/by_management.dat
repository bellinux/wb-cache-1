5|$|From a {{study of}} all the {{information}} available to the Board it is concluded that this flight crew was not capable of performing the function or assuming {{the responsibility for the}} job they presumed to do. The Board further concludes that the management personnel of Imperial Airlines should have been aware of the manner in which company operations were being accomplished. It is believed that the substandard maintenance practices of Imperial's employees were condoned <b>by</b> <b>management.</b> The manner in which maintenance and personnel records were kept by the company confirms this conclusion.|$|E

After filing complaints, {{in collaboration with the}} Center for Women's Law Studies and Legal Services of Beijing University, the women received 170,000 Yuan in back wages and compensation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{performance}} of mutual funds managed <b>by</b> publicly-traded <b>management</b> companies with those managed <b>by</b> private <b>management</b> companies. We find that publicly-traded management companies invest in riskier assets and charge higher management fees relative to the funds managed <b>by</b> private <b>management</b> companies. At the same time, however, the risk-adjusted returns of the mutual funds managed <b>by</b> publicly-traded <b>management</b> companies {{do not appear to}} outperform those of the mutual funds managed <b>by</b> private <b>management</b> companies. This finding is consistent with both the risk reduction and agency cost arguments that {{have been made in the}} literature. Contact...|$|R

He rose through the ranks of Rhodesia Railways to become a locomotive engine driver and became involved in the trade union movement, joining the Rhodesian Railway Workers' Union. After participating in the unsuccessful 1929 Rhodesian Railways strike Welensky was moved <b>by</b> <b>management</b> to Broken Hill, the main base of the railways in Northern Rhodesia. In 1933 he became Chairman of the Broken Hill branch of the union, and was appointed to the National Council.|$|E
5|$|Due to this storyline, the TNA World Tag Team Championship defense by A.J. Styles and Tomko against Samoa Joe and Kevin Nash {{was added}} to the event. The match was {{originally}} promoted to have been Scott Hall and Nash challenging for the titles, however this was changed due to unknown reasons on the January 3, 2008 episode of Impact! <b>by</b> <b>Management</b> Director Jim Cornette. A narrative tied to this match involved Joe becoming angry with his position in the company and requesting more money and title opportunities due to Hall's no-showing of TNA's Turning Point event on December 2, 2007 and events that transpired as a result.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} find a {{replacement}} for the 2 BAe 146s, Drukair management fielded submissions from Airbus, Boeing and Embraer to determine their products' suitability to meet Drukair's stringent operational requirements. Bombardier was also invited <b>by</b> <b>management</b> to demonstrate the CRJ900 regional jet, however, the airline was advised by Bombardier the aircraft would be unsuited for operations at Paro. In February 2002, the Airbus A319 became the largest aircraft to ever land at Paro Airport, when Airbus demonstrated the aircraft to the airline. By October, Boeing had withdrawn from the competition due to {{not being able to}} source an aircraft to demonstrate to the airline. With the Embraer E-190 yet to fly, it was expected that Drukair would order the A319. However, the government had concerns regarding financing for the purchase, and in October the final decision was delayed. After a short period of time, the government instructed management to begin evaluations once again, and a Boeing 737–700 conducted eleven test flights at Paro Airport in February 2003, in which it was demonstrated it met the requirements of the airline for operation into Paro.|$|E
5|$|Just over a {{year after}} being drafted, Brewer signed his first {{professional}} contract with his draft team, the New York Islanders, in August 1998. Entering the NHL, Brewer {{was regarded as a}} future Norris Trophy candidate, and as a result, his contract was an entry level three-year, $2.775-million deal complemented by a $1-million signing bonus, the highest base salary available for a rookie. Brewer made his NHL debut on October 10, 1998, against the Pittsburgh Penguins, and on November 5, Brewer scored his first career goal against the Carolina Hurricanes' Trevor Kidd. Throughout his rookie season, Brewer was considered {{an integral part of the}} Islanders' defence, and, along with Zdeno Chára, Kenny Jönsson and Roberto Luongo, was considered untouchable <b>by</b> <b>management</b> at the 1999 NHL trade deadline. Brewer finished his rookie season with eleven points in 63 games.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Sides of Steel Cage {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Kurt Angle and the {{challenger}} Samoa Joe. This bout was announced on the March 13 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact! <b>by</b> <b>Management</b> Director Jim Cornette. Joe proclaimed on the same episode {{that if he did}} not win the title at Lockdown, he would quit TNA in the storyline. Afterwards, Joe was not seen until the April 10 episode of Impact!, with training for the match being the reason for his absence. On the April 10 episode of Impact!, a contract signing took place between Joe and Angle regarding the match. Joe signed the contract, making it official if he lost the match at Lockdown he would instead quit professional wrestling forever. This match was the progression of a long-standing series of matches between Angle and Joe. Angle having won three of four of their past contests at TNA's Genesis PPV event on November 19, 2006, TNA's Turning Point PPV event on December 19, 2006, TNA's Final Resolution on January 14, 2007, and at TNA's Hard Justice on August 12, 2007.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{performance}} of mutual funds managed <b>by</b> publicly-traded <b>management</b> companies with those managed <b>by</b> private <b>management</b> companies. We find that publicly-traded management companies invest in riskier assets and charge higher management fees than do the funds managed <b>by</b> private <b>management</b> companies. The risk-adjusted returns of the mutual funds managed <b>by</b> publicly-traded <b>management</b> companies are also {{lower than those of}} the mutual funds managed <b>by</b> private <b>management</b> companies. This finding is consistent with both a risk spreading and agency cost argument. The paper also shows that the idiosyncratic risk of the publicly-traded management company's stock significantly differs from the idiosyncratic risk of the assets they manage, suggesting that previous research using the stock's idiosyncratic risk as a proxy for the idiosyncratic risk of the company's assets to study the determinants of publicly-traded companies' ownership concentration may be misleading. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to highlight, from a {{marketing}} perspective, the manner and {{conditions in which}} {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} can use modern management methods in planning the marketing activity. Using modern methods of management are particularly important for managers of these organizations and especially for marketers. Thus, the following methods play a significant role within the marketing activitiesn# 8217; development for marketing specialists, namely: <b>management</b> <b>by</b> objectives, <b>management</b> <b>by</b> budgets, <b>management</b> <b>by</b> projects, and <b>management</b> <b>by</b> product. The high degree of understanding and using the above methods is, in the current economic environment, one of the determinants of the market success of small and medium-sized enterprises. In the current context, the adoption of the <b>management</b> <b>by</b> objectives is not a facultative option for the small and medium-sized enterprises, but rather a binding one in the context of adopting and practicing an efficient marketing with significant results on the development of marketing programs comprised within them. Similarly to the <b>management</b> <b>by</b> objectives, the use of the <b>management</b> <b>by</b> budgets within the small and medium-sized enterprises has a series of features required by their smaller size, features that should be considered by marketers. Regarding the use of <b>management</b> <b>by</b> projects, this method has to constitute the foundation for the elaboration of marketing programs developed within the small and medium-sized enterprises, thereby allowing shaping an action that can be accompanied by success in achieving the goals comprised within the marketing programs. Finally, the role of the <b>management</b> <b>by</b> product is extremely important in the marketing activity within the small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in the operationalization of concepts such as strategic marketing and tactical marketing. This paper thus outlines from {{a marketing}} point of view the main issues aiming at understanding and using modern management methods in the marketing activity planning process within SMEs...|$|R

He suggested that Diana and Dodi may {{have been killed by}} MI6 in the same way, although that claim was dismissed at their inquest in 2007. MI6 admitted that plans of that nature had been drafted regarding a different Eastern European official, but that the proposal had been swiftly rejected <b>by</b> <b>management.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unrepresented <b>by</b> <b>management,</b> Davis {{sent his}} script out {{unsolicited}} to agents and studios {{over the course}} of the next three years. Davis secured representation through his efforts and received a number of studio offers, but, in a story reminiscent of Sylvester Stallone's experience with Rocky, he refused to sell the script unless he was signed to play the title role. He also resisted demands that Marty be made heterosexual. While Davis and director O'Flaherty honed the script, Davis trained as a boxer to add to the film's authenticity. The film was shot in Los Angeles on high-definition digital video on a budget of $200,000 and was O'Flaherty's feature debut.|$|E
5|$|The Wall Street Crash of 1929 {{occurred}} {{only weeks}} after the building was completed. At that time more than 80% of the apartments were rented and some 300 students had signed up to take classes at the Institute. However, both rentals and student fees were soon depleted, and the nonprofit corporation that ran the building was unable to meet its payments. On April 6, 1932, this organization was sued for nonpayment of taxes and sinking fund payments due on the mortgage bonds. At {{that time it was}} alleged that the building was being mismanaged, the principal evidence offered being the provision of free living quarters to the Roeriches and their followers. Horch successfully contested the suit partly on a technicality and partly by explaining that the 20 rooms occupied rent-free were used <b>by</b> <b>management</b> as partial compensation to employees of the corporation. Representatives of the bond holders had argued that the parts of the building that did not produce rental income—that is the museum, institute, and other cultural spaces—should be converted to apartments but Horch successfully countered that the museum et al. were an asset that generated a substantial tax exemption and that, in normal times, they led to higher rental rates from the existing apartments than would comparable apartments. He also pointed out that the demanded conversion would be expensive (about $100,000). In June 1932, the foreclosure case ended with Horch being named one of two receivers tasked with clearing the building's debts.|$|E

5|$|The rioting {{impacted}} Chicago's economy. Some of the South Side's {{industry was}} closed during the riot. Businesses in the Loop were also affected by {{closure of the}} street cars. Many workers stayed away from affected areas. At the Union Stock Yard, one of Chicago's largest employers, all 15,000 African-American workers were initially expected {{to return to work}} on Monday, August 4, 1919. But after arson near white employees' homes near the Stock Yards on August 3, the management banned African-American employees from the stockyards in fear of further rioting. Governor Lowden noted his opinion that the troubles were related to labor issues rather than race. Nearly one-third of the African-American employees were non-union, and were resented by union employees for that reason. African-American workers were kept out of the stockyards for ten days {{after the end of the}} riot because of continued unrest. On August 8, 1919, about 3,000 non-union African Americans showed up for work under protection of special police, deputy sheriffs, and militia. The white union employees threatened to strike unless such security forces were discontinued. Their main grievance against African Americans was that they were non-union and had been used <b>by</b> <b>management</b> as strikebreakers in earlier years. Many African Americans fled the city as a result of the riots and damage.|$|E
