25|$|Matte solder {{is usually}} fused {{to provide a}} better <b>bonding</b> <b>surface</b> for bare copper. Treatments, such as benzimidazolethiol, prevent surface {{oxidation}} of bare copper. The places to which components will be mounted are typically plated, because untreated bare copper oxidizes quickly, and therefore is not readily solderable. Traditionally, any exposed copper was coated with solder by hot air solder levelling (HASL). The HASL finish prevents oxidation from the underlying copper, thereby guaranteeing a solderable surface. This solder was a tin-lead alloy, however new solder compounds are now used to achieve compliance with the RoHS directive in the EU, which restricts the use of lead. One of these lead-free compounds is SN100CL, made up of 99.3% tin, 0.7% copper, 0.05% nickel, and a nominal of 60ppm germanium.|$|E

50|$|As adhesives, epoxies bond {{in three}} ways: a) Mechanically, because the <b>bonding</b> <b>surfaces</b> are roughened; b) By proximity, because the cured resins are {{physically}} {{so close to}} the <b>bonding</b> <b>surfaces</b> that they are hard to separate; c) Ionically, because the epoxy resins form ionic bonds at an atomic level with the <b>bonding</b> <b>surfaces.</b> This last is substantially the strongest of the three. By contrast, polyester resins can only bond using the first two of these, which greatly reduces their utility as adhesives and in marine repair.|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study is to analyse the impact of the adhesive <b>bonded</b> <b>surface</b> treatment on the maximum force required to cause destruction, i. e. bearing capacity of T-joints bonded with various adhesives. Experimental results showed that the type of the adhesive affected the limit values of a force required for the destruction of the adhesive bond. The effect of the <b>bonded</b> <b>surface</b> treatment was also confirmed. From the results of experiment it was proved on five tested two-component epoxy adhesives that the negative effect of the peeling forces can be reduced by mechanical treatment of the adhesive <b>bonded</b> <b>surface</b> e. g. blasting.

This causes a diffusion of sodium ions (Na+) out of the bond interface to the backside of the glass to the cathode. That results, combined with humidity in formation of NaOH. High voltage helps to support the drifting of the positive ions in glass to the cathode. The diffusion is according to the Boltzmann distribution exponentially related to the temperature. The glass (NaO2) with its remaining oxygen ions (O2−) is negatively volume charged at the <b>bonding</b> <b>surface</b> compared to the silicon (compare to figure [...] "ion drifting in bond glass" [...] (1)).

[...] In examining the behavior of water at hydrophobic surfaces, Richmond found that weaker dipoles in an organic phase is more effective for orienting individual water molecules near the interface. [...] The interactions at aqueous / hydrophobic interfaces are important for understanding biochemical properties at boundaries such as cell membranes, as is the solvation of charge in such environments.

50|$|The use of {{adhesives}} {{offers many}} advantages over binding {{techniques such as}} sewing, mechanical fastening, thermal bonding, etc. These include the ability to bind different materials together, to distribute stress more efficiently across the joint, the cost effectiveness of an easily mechanized process, an improvement in aesthetic design, and increased design flexibility. Disadvantages of adhesive use include decreased stability at high temperatures, relative weakness in bonding large objects with a small <b>bonding</b> <b>surface</b> area, and greater difficulty in separating objects during testing. Adhesives are typically organized by the method of adhesion. These are then organized into reactive and non-reactive adhesives, which refers to whether the adhesive chemically reacts in order to harden. Alternatively they can be organized by whether the raw stock is of natural or synthetic origin, or by their starting physical phase.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the {{hydrophobic}} effect is not fully understood.Some argue that the hydrophobic interaction is mostly an entropic effect originating from the disruption of highly dynamic hydrogen bonds between molecules of liquid water by the nonpolar solute. A hydrocarbon chain or a similar nonpolar region of a large molecule is incapable of forming hydrogen bonds with water. Introduction of such a non-hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>surface</b> into water causes disruption of the hydrogen bonding network between water molecules. The hydrogen bonds are reoriented tangentially to such surface to minimize disruption of the hydrogen bonded 3D network of water molecules, and {{this leads to a}} structured water [...] "cage" [...] around the nonpolar surface. The water molecules that form the [...] "cage" [...] (or solvation shell) have restricted mobility. In the solvation shell of small nonpolar particles, the restriction amounts to some 10%. For example, in the case of dissolved xenon at room temperature a mobility restriction of 30% has been found. In the case of larger nonpolar molecules, the reorientational and translational motion of the water molecules in the solvation shell may be restricted by a factor of two to four; thus, at 25 °C the reorientational correlation time of water increases from 2 to 4-8 picoseconds. Generally, this leads to significant losses in translational and rotational entropy of water molecules and makes the process unfavorable in terms of the free energy in the system. By aggregating together, nonpolar molecules reduce the surface area exposed to water and minimize their disruptive effect.|$|E

40|$|The {{penetration}} {{and performance}} of polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (pMDI) wood binder was investigated according to three factors: substrate species (aspen, yellow-poplar, or southern yellow pine); anatomical bonding plane (radial or tangential); and moisture content (0 %, 5 %, or 12 %). Compression shear block tests and fluorescence microscopy were used to examine bond performance and resin penetration. Statistically, each of the aforementioned factors impacted results. As moisture content increased, observed bond strengths and wood failure increased. Bond formation did not occur when the substrates were equilibrated to 0 % moisture content, except for the radial <b>bonding</b> <b>surfaces</b> of pine, which did adhere. At 5 and 12 % moisture contents, tangential <b>bonding</b> <b>surfaces</b> out-performed radial <b>bonding</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In terms of resin penetration, moisture content was clearly the most important variable. Little penetration was observed at 0 % moisture content, while extensive resin penetration was observed at elevated moisture contents.
