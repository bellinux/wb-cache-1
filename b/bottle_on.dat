Claire and Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) give it to Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), Jin's wife, and she opts to bury the <b>bottle</b> <b>on</b> the beach. In the hatch, Jack and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) inspect the mysterious concrete barricade blocking {{what appears to be}} a corridor to another section of the bunker. They discover that the barrier is very thick and that the corridor is also blocked on the foundation level. Later, Jack and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) share a moment of sexual tension when she exits the shower wearing only a towel.|$|E

Finkelman, who is Jewish, and his staff, which contains African Americans, initially decided the show would go on, feeling there was insufficient evidence to cancel the performance.|$|E

25|$|Tentative {{evidence}} for the ship continued to emerge. In 1934 The New York Times reported that a København cadet's diary {{had been found in}} a <b>bottle</b> <b>on</b> Bouvet Island in the South Atlantic. The supposed diary indicated that the ship had been destroyed by icebergs and abandoned, the crew taking their chances in lifeboats. In 1935, human remains and the remains of a lifeboat were found partly buried in the sand along the southwest coast of Africa. These may have come from København.|$|E
25|$|In February 2002 several scandals {{surrounding}} his administration were {{revealed in the}} media. The first headlines involved exceptionally high spending in his administration. It was claimed that he routinely drank luxury red wine (at a cost of around $1,200 USD per <b>bottle)</b> <b>on</b> the public expense account. Furthermore, the wine was bought at a local restaurant in which Brixtofte was a shareholder. Municipal employees reported that the charismatic mayor had over years shown increasing signs of alcoholism and established an autocratic, timid climate at the town hall.

On July 4, 1987, Daytona Beach police detained Wuornos and Moore at a bar for questioning regarding an incident {{in which they were}} accused of assault and battery with a beer <b>bottle.</b> <b>On</b> March 12, 1988, Wuornos accused a Daytona Beach bus driver of assault. She claimed that he pushed her off the bus following a confrontation. Moore was listed as a witness to the incident. Up until her execution, Wuornos claimed to still be in love with Moore.|$|E

25|$|The {{transfer}} method {{follows the}} first steps of the traditional method in that after primary fermentation the cuvée is transferred to bottles to complete secondary fermentation, which allows for additional complexity. When the secondary fermentation is complete and the wine has spent the desired {{amount of time in}} <b>bottle</b> <b>on</b> yeast lees (six months is the requirement to label a wine 'bottle fermented') then the individual bottles are transferred (hence the name) into a larger tank. The wine is then filtered, liqueur de dosage added, and then filled back into new bottles for sale. This method allows for complexity to be built into the wine, but also gives scope for blending options after the wine has gone into bottle and reduces the bottle-to-bottle variations that can be hard to control in the traditional method.|$|E

The recording session for the basic track {{was one of the}} longest the Beatles ever undertook, running from the afternoon of 7 October through the night until 7am the next day. McCartney played Hammond organ on the track, and an [...] "eerie rattling" [...] effect at the end was created by a note causing a wine <b>bottle</b> <b>on</b> top of the organ's Leslie speaker to resonate.|$|E

They appeared on The Cafe on 16 October 2008. The Prodigy personally invited the band to support them on their sold-out arena tour of the UK; all of the members are fans of Fight Like Apes and Liam Howlett entered their dressing room to give his regards. Sony Music Entertainment Japan signed the band for the Asian release of Fight Like Apes and the Mystery of the Golden Medallion. They headlined the Levi's One to Watch Tour in November 2008.

500|$|On {{their return}} to England in September, Mary and Percy moved—with Claire Clairmont, who took lodgings nearby—to Bath, where they hoped to keep Claire’s {{pregnancy}} secret. At Cologny, Mary Godwin had received two letters from her half-sister, Fanny Imlay, who alluded to her [...] "unhappy life"; on 9 October, Fanny wrote an [...] "alarming letter" [...] from Bristol that sent Percy Shelley racing off to search for her, without success. On the morning of 10 October, Fanny Imlay {{was found dead in}} a room at a Swansea inn, along with a suicide note and a laudanum <b>bottle.</b> <b>On</b> 10 December, Percy Shelley's wife, Harriet, was discovered drowned in the Serpentine, a lake in Hyde Park, London. Both suicides were hushed up. Harriet’s family obstructed Percy Shelley's efforts—fully supported by Mary Godwin—to assume custody of his two children by Harriet. His lawyers advised him to improve his case by marrying; so he and Mary, who was pregnant again, married on 30 December 1816 at St Mildred's Church, Bread Street, London. Mr and Mrs Godwin were present and the marriage ended the family rift.|$|E
500|$|With Lisa {{now facing}} a long jail sentence, Marge decides {{to help her}} out. She starts reading Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species and becomes {{addicted}} to it. When the trial resumes, Marge tells Lisa that she now knows a way that she can help her. While Ned is being cross-examined by Clarice, Marge gives Homer a cold beer. Homer, ecstatic at getting a beer, tries to open it unsuccessfully. The more he tries, the more primitive he gets, hooting and banging the <b>bottle</b> <b>on</b> the bench, disrupting the trial. Finally, Ned loses his cool and refers to Homer as a [...] "big monkey-faced gorilla." [...] Clarice then asks Ned to compare {{the picture of the}} [...] "missing link" [...] and Homer shaking the beer over his head, and asks if he truthfully believes Homer cannot be related to apes. Ned cannot and concedes victory to Lisa. Lisa kindly tells Ned that she fully respects religious beliefs, but she just does not think it is proper for the church to dominate the school, the same way that Mr. Flanders and Reverend Lovejoy do not want scientists taking over the church. Ned agrees and offers to take Lisa and his kids out for ice cream.|$|E

Removing the base of the bottle made a funnel which would be left at the proper height. Deposited urine simply soaked into the ground; when the area became saturated, the device was relocated.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fundamental}} {{distinction between}} real and other ales {{is that the}} yeast is still present and living in the container from which the real ale is served, although it will have settled {{to the bottom and}} is usually not poured into the glass. Because the yeast is still alive, a slow process of fermentation continues in the cask or <b>bottle</b> <b>on</b> the way to the consumer, allowing the beer to retain its freshness. Another distinction is that real ale should be served without the aid of added carbon dioxide, or [...] "top pressure" [...] as it is commonly known. Common dispensing methods are the handpump, or [...] "by gravity" [...] direct from the cask. Electric pumps are occasionally seen, especially in the Midlands and Scotland.|$|E
