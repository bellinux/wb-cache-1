5|$|Listeners {{unfamiliar}} with contemporary Christian music (CCM) often assume that Loder sings hymn-style music. Her career {{is unusual in}} that it began in CCM; most young musicians choose music genres such as country and pop, which are generally considered more likely to bring commercial success. Loder has asserted that she chose CCM <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> purpose to her music; many of her songs are about God, but {{they may also be}} interpreted as being about other subjects.|$|E
5|$|Through the series, {{the cities}} used within the Crazy Taxi games have been {{influenced}} by real-world cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, and Las Vegas. Certain versions of the Crazy Taxi game include in-game counterparts of real-world businesses, including Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, FILA, and Tower Records; these were often destination targets for the passengers. Although {{this is one of the}} most prominent examples of product placement in video gaming history, it is generally looked upon relatively favorably amongst gamers, perhaps <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> a sense of realism to the fictional cities in the game. These establishments have been replaced with generic businesses in later games due to licensing difficulties.|$|E

5|$|Given these {{properties}} of DNA damage and mutation, {{it can be}} seen that DNA damage is a special problem in non-dividing or slowly-dividing cells, where unrepaired damage will tend to accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly-dividing cells, unrepaired DNA damage that does not kill the cell by blocking replication will tend to cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell's survival. Thus, in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells will tend to be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will tend to clonally expand at the expense of neighboring cells in the tissue. This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism, because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer. Thus, DNA damage in frequently dividing cells, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> rise to mutations, is a prominent cause of cancer. In contrast, DNA damage in infrequently-dividing cells is likely a prominent cause of aging.|$|E
5|$|Hemingway's stories {{typically}} position {{nature as}} a source of refuge and rebirth. His characters are often shown retreating to the country in search of regeneration. Nature acts as the setting for hunters' or fishermen's existential moment of transcendence—especially at the moment when prey is killed. In Big Two-Hearted River, Nick walks away from a ruined town, and enters the woods to hike toward the river, unharmed by the fire. His journey is motivated by absolution; the river is described as two-hearted <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> life in the form of food (fish) and offers redemption. In the woods, Nick stops in a grove of trees that is described as chapel-like, a description that echoes Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage in which Henry Fleming flees to a chapel-like grove of trees. In the grove Nick sleeps well {{for the first time since}} the war, and there he begins the healing process. The next morning he goes to the river, wading into the water to fish. At first the strength of the current frightens him, and for some moments he has difficulty controlling himself.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E

She has at various times said that she chose to write <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was not as time-consuming a career as the law, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> her something to do during naptimes, it kept her entertained, because she was starved of someone to laugh at her jokes and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> her a way of putting off going back to work.|$|R

25|$|The {{notion of}} {{multi-level}} breaks is of {{some interest in}} theoretical computer science, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> rise to what is today called the Kosaraju hierarchy.

Rao Kosaraju refined the structured program theorem by proving that it's possible to avoid adding additional variables in structured programming, as long as arbitrary-depth, multi-level breaks from loops are allowed. Furthermore, Kosaraju proved that a strict hierarchy of programs exists: for every integer n, there exists a program containing a multi-level break of depth n that cannot be rewritten as a program with multi-level breaks of depth less than n without introducing added variables.|$|E

25|$|The play ends at Shrewsbury, {{after the}} battle. The death of Hotspur {{has taken the}} heart out of the rebels, and the king's forces prevail. Henry is pleased with the outcome, not least <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> {{him a chance to}} execute Thomas Percy, the Earl of Worcester, one of his chief enemies (though {{previously}} one of his greatest friends). Meanwhile, Hal shows off his kingly mercy in praise of valour; having taken the valiant Douglas prisoner, Hal orders his enemy released without ransom. But the war goes on; now the king's forces must deal with the Archbishop of York, who has joined with Northumberland, and with the forces of Mortimer and Glendower. This unsettled ending sets the stage for Henry IV, Part 2.|$|E
25|$|Behavioral {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} that sharks can take visual cues in order to discriminate between different objects. The bull shark is able to discriminate between colors of mesh netting that is present underwater. It was found that bull sharks tended to avoid mesh netting of bright colors rather than colors that blended in with the water. Bright yellow mesh netting {{was found to be}} easily avoided when it was placed {{in the path of the}} bull shark. This was found to be the reason that sharks are attracted to bright yellow survival gear rather than ones that were painted black. This is very important <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> an insight into how bull sharks are able to pick up certain visual keys underwater that might give them an advantage when seeking out certain prey.|$|E
25|$|Impulsive {{behavior}} is common, including substance or alcohol abuse, eating disorders, unprotected sex or indiscriminate sex with multiple partners, reckless spending, and reckless driving. Impulsive behavior may also include leaving jobs or relationships, running away, and self-injury. People with BPD act impulsively <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> them {{the feeling of}} immediate relief from their emotional pain. However, in the long term, people with BPD suffer increased pain from the shame and guilt that follow such actions. A cycle often begins in which people with BPD feel emotional pain, engage in impulsive behavior to relieve that pain, feel shame and guilt over their actions, feel emotional pain from the shame and guilt, and then experience stronger urges to engage in impulsive behavior to relieve the new pain. As time goes on, impulsive behavior may become an automatic response to emotional pain.|$|E

25|$|U.S. analyst Ashley J. Tellis {{argues that}} the Indo-US nuclear deal is {{attractive}} to India <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> it access to far more options on its civil nuclear programme than would otherwise be the case, primarily by ending its isolation from the international nuclear community. These options include access to latest technologies, access to higher unit output reactors which are more economical, access to global finance for building reactors, ability to export its indigenous small reactor size PHWRs, better information flow for its research community, etc. Finally, the deal also gives India two options that are relatively independent from the three-stage programme, {{at least in terms}} of their dependencies on success or failure. The first option is that, India can opt to stay with the first stage reactors as long as the global supply of uranium lasts. The plus side of this is that it covers any risk from short term delays or failures in implementing the three-stage programme. On the negative side, this is an option that is antithetical to the underlying objective of energy independence through the exploitation of thorium.|$|E
25|$|We first {{find the}} Muslim month number {{corresponding}} to {{the first month of}} the Jewish year which begins in AD20874. Dividing 20874 by 19 gives quotient 1098 and remainder 12. Dividing 2026 by 19 gives quotient 106 and remainder 12. 2026 is chosen <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> the same remainder on division by 19 as 20874. The two years are therefore (1098–106)=992×19 years apart. The Muslim month number {{corresponding to the}} first Jewish month is therefore 992×7=6944 higher than in 2026. To convert into years and months divide by twelve – 6944/12=578 years and 8 months. Adding, we get 1447y 10m + 20874y – 2026y + 578y 8m = 20874y 6m. Therefore, the first month of the Jewish year beginning in AD20874 corresponds to the sixth month of the Muslim year AH20874. The worked example in Conversion between Jewish and civil dates, shows that the civil date of the first day of this month (ignoring the displacements) is Friday, 14 June. The year AH20875 will therefore begin seven months later, {{on the first day of}} the eighth Jewish month, which the worked example shows to be 7 January, AD20875 (again ignoring the displacements). The date given by this method, being calculated, may differ by a day from the actual date, which is determined by observation.|$|E
500|$|The episode guest stars Tony Shalhoub as Dr. Banton. Shalhoub, {{who had a}} {{recurring}} role on the NBC series Wings, was not familiar with The X-Files when he was offered the part {{because at the time}} he did not watch much television.

When Shalhoub informed people {{that he was going to}} Vancouver to film an episode of the series, he claimed that [...] "the response was unbelievable". Shalhoub was impressed with the on-location filming that the series did; he noted, [...] "Ninety-nine percent of our filming on Wings is done on a soundstage, while most of their material is shot on location in and around Vancouver.
