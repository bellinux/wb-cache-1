40|$|Abstract. A CV joint {{outer race}} is an {{important}} load-supporting part in cars. Its geometry is very complicated. Traditional hot and cold forging methods have their own limitations to produce such a complex shaped part. Therefore, multistage forging may be advantageous to produce this part. The key point of outer race is performing the geometry of ball grooves with negative slope angle. Traditional methods form the <b>ball</b> <b>groove</b> by machining that takes long time and waste many portions of the material. Thus near net shape forging is an attractive option for producing of outer race. In this study, the process sequence in the multistage forging of a CV joint outer race has been investigated by using the rigid plastic finite volume method and forging process sequence is designed which can produce a near net-shape housing without defects within a given press capacity. Finally physical modelling with commercial lead is used to verify the reliability of numerical simulation results...|$|E

40|$|Linear motion (LM) ball guides {{have good}} {{accuracy}} and high efficiency. They are widely applied for precision machinery such as machine tools, semiconductor fabrication machines and robots. However, friction force incurs heat between the <b>balls</b> and <b>grooves.</b> Thermal expansion {{due to the}} heat deteriorates stiffness and accuracy of the LM ball guides. For accurate estimation of stiffness and accuracy during the linear motion, friction models of LM ball guides are required. To formulate accurate frictional models of LM ball guides according to load and preload conditions, rolling and viscous frictional analyses have been performed in this paper. Contact loads between <b>balls</b> and <b>grooves</b> are derived from Hertzian contact analysis. Contact angle variation is incorporated for the precision modeling. Viscous friction model is formulated from the shear stress of lubricant and the contact area between <b>balls</b> and <b>grooves.</b> Experiments confirm validity of the developed friction model for various external load and feedrate conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{outer race}} of a {{constant}} velocity (CV) joint {{is an important}} automotive component {{that is difficult to}} be forged because its shape is very complicated and the required precision is high. Since traditional cold forging methods are not always capable of producing complexly shaped parts, such parts are often made by processes, which require intense machining operations at relatively high costs. Thus near net shape forging is an attractive option for producing of outer race. Actual problems in final ironing sequence are prevention of ductile fracture and surface defects in final product and true formation of internal <b>ball</b> <b>grooves</b> of the workpiece. In this study Cockroft&Latham failure criterion was applied to final ironing sequence. Finally physical modeling is down using lead. In order to investigate the flow of the billet material during forging, the experimentally obtained section profile of internal grooves as measured by a CMM is compared with simulation based profile...|$|R

This work was carried out inside the A 1 research group which mainly deals with the development of actuators for medium and high voltage breakers and contactors. The purpose of this work is to obtain one or more user-friendly methods to estimate the radial and axial load-deflection relationship of deep <b>groove</b> <b>ball</b> bearings and create an Adams user-defined joint which simulates their mechanical behaviour in multibody dynamic systems. Firstly some theoretical models found in the literature were studied and conformed to the end-user needs. Then a parametrical finite element model was realised to have a basis to compare the analytical models and to have an alternative to them to estimate the load-deflection relationship of a deep <b>groove</b> <b>ball</b> bearing. The analytical model which best fitted the finite element results was chosen to be implemented in the Adams user-defined joint.

The relationships between amplitudes of frequencies for impulse train, delayed impulse train and combination of two impulse trains have been established. Frequency spectra for single and two defects on either race of deep <b>groove</b> <b>ball</b> bearings are compared.

Radial junctions in Si micropillars are inspected by optical and scanning electron micro­scopies, using a CrO 3 -based staining solution, which enables visualization of the junction depth. When applying identical-doping parameters to flat substrates, <b>ball</b> <b>grooving,</b> followed by staining and optical microscopy, yields similar junction depth values as high-resolution scanning electron microscopy imaging on stained cross-sections and secondary ion mass spectrometry depth profilometry.

The functionality of micropillar arrays with radial junctions is evidenced by improved short-circuit current densities and photovoltaic efficiencies compared with flat surfaces, for both n- and p-type wafers (average pillar arrays efficiencies of 9. 4 % and 11 %, respectively, compared with 8. 3 % and 6. 4 % for the flat samples) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Wear loss {{is defined}} as volume, weight and length {{difference}} due to the wear process. In practice, measurement of wear loss is difficult because {{most parts of the}} machine have no simple shape and are not easy or even impossible to measure the changes of volume, weight or length. In this paper, a particular method of wear loss measurement based on computer image collection and analysis was developed to measure the length changes of some particular parts such as <b>ball</b> <b>grooves</b> of the muster clutch’s release ring of a type of tracked vehicle. Macro-surface profiles of a worn surface of a groove on a release ring were taken by a digital camera first and were demarcated. Then worn scars of these digital photos were scaled in length by a computer image processing software of DT vision foundry. The geometrical relationship between wear length and depth was analyzed so that the wear depth was available as well. Results show that the length of the scar is 15. 9 mm and the depth is 1. 48 mm. Then the surface of the wear scar was measured by a type of 3 D laser scanning machine and the points cloud was rearranged and edited by a reverse software of Surfacer. Results of 3 D scanning show that the length of the scar is 15. 7 mm and the depth is 1. 56 mm, which is well consistent with the results of the method mentioned above. It demonstrates the effectiveness and economy of using the method of computer image collection and analysis for wear loss measurement. ...|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} {{variation in}} different clubs is loft, or the angle between the club's {{face and the}} vertical plane. It is loft that is the primary determinant of the ascending trajectory of the golf ball, with the tangential angle of the club head's swing arc at impact being a secondary and relatively minor consideration (though these small changes in swing angle can nevertheless have a significant influence on launch angle when using low-lofted clubs). The impact of the club compresses the <b>ball,</b> while <b>grooves</b> on the club face give the ball backspin. Together, the compression and backspin create lift. The majority of woods and irons are labeled with a number; higher numbers indicate shorter shafts and higher lofts, which give the ball a higher and shorter trajectory.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{develops}} a five {{degrees of freedom}} (5 -DOF) model for aeroengine spindle dual-rotor system dynamic analysis. In this system, the dual rotors are supported on two angular contact ball bearings and two deep <b>groove</b> <b>ball</b> bearings, one of the latter-mentioned bearings works as the inter-shaft bearing. Driven by respective motors, the dual rotors have different co-rotating speeds. The proposed model mathematically formulates the nonlinear displacements, elastic deflections and contact forces of bearings with consideration of 5 -DOF and coupling of dual rotors. The nonlinear equations of motions of dual rotors with 5 -DOF are solved using Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg algorithm. In order to investigate {{the effect of the}} introduced 5 -DOF and nonlinear dynamic bearing model, we compare the proposed model with two models: the 3 -DOF model of this system only considering three translational degrees of freedom (Gupta, 1993, rotational freedom is neglected); the 5 -DOF model where the deep <b>groove</b> <b>ball</b> bearings are simplified as linear elastic spring (Guskov, 2007).
