5|$|Harding also {{wished to}} promote aviation, and Hoover again took the lead, {{convening}} a national conference on commercial aviation. The discussions focused on safety matters, inspection of airplanes, and licensing of pilots. Harding again promoted legislation <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> done until 1926, when the Air Commerce Act created the Bureau of Aeronautics within Hoover's Commerce Department.|$|E
5|$|In 1887 Selfe {{published}} {{proposals for}} a city underground railway, with stations at Wynyard, the Rocks and Circular Quay, and a loop to Woolloomooloo and the eastern suburbs. The proposal included a bridge across Sydney Harbour for trains, vehicles and pedestrians. He presented these schemes to the Royal Commission on City and Suburban Railways in 1890; <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> to come of it, largely because the 1890s depression brought public works initiatives to a standstill.|$|E
5|$|Phát and Thảo were {{stripped}} of their ranks, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> initially done as far as prosecuting or sentencing them for their involvement in the coup. The new junta decided to ignore Khiêm’s actions and he remained in Washington as the ambassador, with no further action taken. Phát and Thảo stayed in hiding in Catholic villages. They offered to surrender and support the government if they and their officers were granted amnesty.|$|E

5|$|Thảo and Phát were {{stripped}} of their ranks, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> initially done as far as prosecuting or sentencing them for their involvement in the coup for the time being. They went into hiding in Catholic villages and offered to surrender and support the government if they and their officers were granted amnesty. However, this failed to materialize, and in May 1965, a military tribunal loyal to Kỳ sentenced both to death in absentia.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly Janet Woollard {{called for}} the statue's {{genitalia}} to be covered up, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> done. In November 2005 Richard Wilkes again {{called for the}} statue's groin to be covered, {{on the grounds that}} such a depiction would be more historically accurate, as Yagan would have worn a covering for most of the year. Also under consideration is {{the creation of a new}} statue with a head shape that accords better with the forensic reconstruction of Yagan's head.|$|E
5|$|In August 1958, workmen digging peat {{in an area}} of Chat Moss near Worsley {{discovered}} a severed head and called the police. It was initially believed that the head had been in the bog for less than a year, and so a search was conducted for more remains, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> found. After X-rays and chemical tests, it was determined that the head had been in the bog for at least 100 years. An inquest was held into the man's death, at which the coroner returned an open verdict, and the head was put in the care of the Manchester Medical School.|$|E

5|$|In St-Calais' time as bishop, {{a long-running}} dispute began between the monks {{of the cathedral}} chapter and {{successive}} bishops. This arose because St-Calais {{did not make a}} formal division of the diocesan revenues between the bishop's household and the monks of the chapter. Nor had he allowed free elections of the prior. He may have promised these things to the monks before his death, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> in writing. Thus, when a non-monk was selected to replace St-Calais, the monks began a long struggle to secure what they felt had been promised to them, including the forging of charters ascribed to St-Calais that supported their case. These forged charters date from {{the second half of the}} 12th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundations}} of the British Empire were laid when England and Scotland were separate kingdoms. In 1496, King Henry VII of England, following the successes of Spain and Portugal in overseas exploration, commissioned John Cabot to lead a voyage to discover a route to Asia via the North Atlantic. Cabot sailed in 1497, {{five years after the}} European discovery of America, but he made landfall on the coast of Newfoundland, and, mistakenly believing (like Christopher Columbus) that he had reached Asia, there was no attempt to found a colony. Cabot led another voyage to the Americas the following year <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> ever heard of his ships again.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal again went on {{the attack}} as the second half began, with another corner won {{following}} a header by Buchan. Hulme drifted in a well placed cross, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> made of it. It was then Cardiff's turn to attack. Curtis sent in a low shot which was saved by Lewis in the Arsenal goal. Shortly afterwards, Butler, the Arsenal midfielder, was struck hard in the face by the ball causing a brief delay to play. The game resumed, and McLachlan took it down the wing for Cardiff, who passed it to Davies, but his shot was just wide of the post. Buchan attempted to return the game to Arsenal's tempo, with a long pass to the left wing for Hoar, but Cardiff City's James Nelson had him covered. City's attacking continued, and a chance was had by Hardy which appeared to shake Lewis in goal as the keeper didn't gather the ball cleanly.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I in August, Active and her flotilla {{were assigned to the}} Grand Fleet. On 1 September, a submarine was spotted inside Scapa Flow and the 2nd DF was detailed to hunt down the imaginary submarine {{while the rest of the}} Grand Fleet put to sea. When not escorting the capital ships of the Grand Fleet, the flotilla spent much time on anti-submarine patrol off the entrances to Scapa Flow. In mid-October, multiple reports of submarines in the Minch caused Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet, to send Active and some of her destroyers there to hunt them down, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> found. After their search was concluded, they joined a large part of the Grand Fleet at Lough Swilly, Ireland, on 22 October. Sometime between October 1915 and January 1916, the cruiser was relieved of her assignment with the 2nd DF and she was on detached service with the Grand Fleet in January.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1170, de Broc was {{involved}} {{in an attempt to}} keep Becket from returning to England. Working with de Broc were Roger de Pont L'Évêque– the Archbishop of York, Gilbert Foliot– the Bishop of London, Josceline de Bohon– the Bishop of Salisbury, Gervase de Cornhill– the Sheriff of Kent, and Reginald de Warenne. De Broc was part of the party that met Becket at Sandwich on 1 December 1070 when the archbishop returned to England. The group, led by Gervase of Cornhill, complained that Becket was sowing dissension in the land by his excommunication of the Archbishop of York and the Bishops of London and Salisbury, but Becket managed to calm the officials by stating he would consider the matter and reply to them the next day. The next day the group was accompanied by some clergy sent by the three excommunicated ecclesiastics, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> accomplished by this meeting except further offers from Becket to consider other options.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{termination of}} the line at Elephant & Castle presented the opportunity for the line to be extended further, to serve Camberwell and other destinations in south-east London. In 1913, the Lord Mayor of London announced a proposal for the Bakerloo Tube to be extended to the Crystal Palace via Camberwell Green, Dulwich and Sydenham Hill, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> done to implement the plan. In 1921, the LER costed an extension to Camberwell, Dulwich and Sydenham and in 1922 plans for an extension to Orpington via Loughborough Junction and Catford were considered. In 1928, a route to Rushey Green via Dulwich was suggested. Again, no action was taken, although the London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee approved an extension to Camberwell in 1926.|$|E

25|$|The islands have a {{reputation}} as pirate treasure islands, {{and there are many}} stories of treasure hunting. According to reliable primary documents, at least four times (in 1813, 1851, 1856 and 1948), serious dig attempts were made to recover the supposed treasures <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> found.|$|E
25|$|And further {{east of the}} Transnistria Governorate {{there were}} many neo-Latin communities: indeed the Romanians/Moldavians in Ukraine - east of the Bug river - were {{calculated}} by a German census to be nearly 780.000 (probably an excessive number), and were made plans to move them to Transnistria in 1942/43. <b>But</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> done.|$|E
25|$|Divers {{examined}} the wreck on April 6 {{to gather information}} on the ship's current position and to seek the missing passengers. The underwater search of this cabin recovered nothing.

25|$|As night approached, {{there were}} signs that the whale may have been {{swimming}} with the current out of London towards the sea: an unconfirmed sighting by a BBC cameraman at 9:00 pm placed the whale in Greenwich. The area was searched <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> found. There were no further official sightings until 1:10 am the following morning in Battersea, after the tide had changed. The whale was monitored until 3:30 am, when Jamie Henn, a Marine Mammal Medic working for BDMLR finally called the monitoring off as the whale would not strand at high tide.|$|E
25|$|After {{this she}} was {{thrashing}} {{around on the}} ground. She was trying to scream <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> coming out. I think I kicked her because she wouldn't keep still. And then I put my foot on to her to keep her still. This didn't work so I stabbed her in the throat. I aimed and stabbed at the hard thing in her neck. I pushed the knife {{all the way in}} but she still wouldn't keep still so I worked out where her heart would be and I stabbed her {{on the left side of}} the chest.|$|E
25|$|On 29 January 2011, Transport Minister Datuk Seri Kong Cho Ha {{said that}} the Gemas-Johor Bharu double-tracking and {{electrification}} project was expected to start that year.

Kong said two consultants had been appointed, a design consultant and an independent checker, to monitor the project. The construction of the 197km of tracks, at an estimated cost between MYR 6 billion and MYR 7 billion, would take three years.|$|E
