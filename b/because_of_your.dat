[...] As “one flesh,” {{the husband and wife}} share this right and privilege; the New Testament does not portray intimacy as something held in reserve by each spouse to be shared on condition.

You deserve to be raped <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> sexual exploits. You're a slut {{and it was just}} a matter of time till you suffered the consequences. Let this be a lesson to you and to all other uppity women." [...] Scholz discussed four passages—Isaiah 3:16-17, Jeremiah 13:22 and 26, Ezekiel 16, and Ezekiel 23. On Isaiah, Scholz wrote that there is a common mistranslation of the Hebrew word pōt as [...] "forehead" [...] or [...] "scalp". Also often translated as [...] "genitals", Scholz believes that a more accurate translation of the word in context is [...] "cunt". Regarding Jeremiah, Scholz wrote, [...] "The poem proclaims that the woman brought this fate upon herself and she is to be blamed for it, while the prophet sides with the sexually violent perpetrators, viewing the attack as deserved and God as justifying it. Rape poetics endorses 'masculine authoritarianism' and the 'dehumanization of women,' perhaps especially when the subject is God." ...|$|E

Ziad replied: [...] "Fairuz is very fond of Sayyed Hassan , although she will be displeased with me, as she was after my last television interview, when I revealed some personal information and she quickly interrupted me". There were strong reactions to this statement, which went viral on social media, and the country's different media outlets did not deviate from their political stances when reacting to Ziad's words. Politicians and celebrities stepped in as well, some of whom objected to affiliating Fairuz to one side of Lebanon's political divide over another, including Druze leader Walid Jumblatt who said: [...] "Fairuz is too great to be criticized, {{and at the same time}} too great to be classified as belonging to this or that political camp". [...] "Let us keep her in her supreme position, and not push her to something she has nothing to do with," [...] Jumblatt added. Ziad, who claims to speak on his mother's behalf [...] "because she prefers to remain silent", responded to his critics by saying: [...] "Apparently it isn’t allowed in the age of strife for the princess of classy Arab art to voice love for the master of resistance". Nasrallah, commenting on the issue during a speech, stated: [...] "An educated highly respected thinker and artist, who maybe espoused different ideologies, might disagree with you on political matters, but personally have [...] fondness for you, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> character, conduct, sacrifices and so on.
