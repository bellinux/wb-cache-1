25|$|On 7 May 1967 Bandini {{was racing}} at the Monaco Grand Prix, running second to Denny Hulme on the 82nd lap, {{when he lost}} control of his car at the harbour chicane. He had just entered the chicane when his Ferrari's left rear wheel hit the guard rail, sending him into an erratic skid. It {{impacted}} a light pole and overturned. The car hit straw bales which lined the harbour side, rupturing the fuel tank, and sparks ignited the fuel as the car rolled over, with Bandini trapped beneath it. Marshals flipped his car upright and pulled Bandini, unconscious, out from the flaming Ferrari. It is thought that, during the effort to right the overturned car, fuel leaked on the hot <b>brake</b> <b>line</b> or the exhaust pipe and exploded. A second fire occurred when the fuel tank exploded after Bandini had been {{pulled away from the}} Ferrari.|$|E

Samples of brake linings were produced using compressive moulding in which the physical and mechanical properties of the samples were studied.

40|$|Braking of road {{vehicles}} {{can be characterized}} as an active – either wanted or unwanted reduction of the force necessary for maintaining the required speed, decreasing the speed, stopping or keeping the vehicle at a standstill. During braking the vehicle loses the acquired motion energy which is most frequently transformed (in case of wanted braking) in the brake system of the vehicle into useless heat released to the environment. Brake force can be defined as the force acting against the motion of a vehicle which is, in case of wanted braking, produced by the vehicle braking system. In case of wanted braking we usually begin with the equilibrium equation of vehicle forces. The paper deals with objective findings and assessment of possible causes leading to the braking system failure paying special attention to the <b>brake</b> <b>lining.</b> The user can approach the <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> failure from two points of view: being aware or unaware of it.

The conclusion of this analysis will serve to design an experimental planning to test brake linings.

Later models have a small turbine-powered electrical generator using air pressure from the <b>brake</b> <b>line</b> to power the ETD's radio and sensors.|$|E

In this work, two different sets of <b>brake</b> <b>lining,</b> i. e., new and worn lining are used to investigate its effect on squeal generation. First, modal testing is performed to determine natural frequencies of those brake linings at free-free boundary condition. Later, squeal tests are carried out using brake dynamometer and squeal frequency is measured up to 10 kHz. Several squeal results are plotted over brake operating conditions to observe the influence of different lining thickness. In addition to these, squeal mechanisms, i. e., modal coupling due to closeness of the natural frequency between drum brake components and negative damping due to negative friction-velocity slope {{that contribute to the}} squeal generation are also investigated and discussed...|$|R

50|$|The one-way {{communication}} of brake {{data from the}} ETD to the locomotive evolved into two-way communication that enables the engineer to apply the brakes from {{both ends of the}} train simultaneously in an emergency. This is useful in the event that a blockage (or an unopened valve) in the train's <b>brake</b> <b>line</b> is preventing dumping the air pressure and causing all of the brakes in the train going into an emergency application. Such a situation could be dangerous, as stopping distance increases with fewer functioning brakes. Dumping the <b>brake</b> <b>line</b> pressure from both the front and rear of the train simultaneously ensures that the entire train applies all of its brakes in emergency. Other electronics within the ETD were also enhanced, and many now include GPS receivers as well as the two-way radio communications.|$|E
50|$|In {{light of}} the above, it is {{reasonable}} to ask why rubber brake hose is used at all, instead of always using braided stainless steel hose. The most typical reason is cost, but also use case. Braided stainless steel hose is typically more expensive than rubber. When the cost difference is extrapolated across hundreds or thousands of units, it is quite compelling to opt for the rubber option, especially when the use case exhibits that the operator will not need or want the additional capabilities offered by a brake system equipped with braided stainless steel <b>brake</b> <b>lines.</b> It thus stands to reason that braided stainless steel <b>brake</b> <b>lines</b> are typically only seen on upmarket motor vehicles such as hot-rods and supercars, or on race-prepped vehicles such as those used in Formula One and touring car series.
