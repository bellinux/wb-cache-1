50|$|Much of the {{offshore}} seabed diving work is inspection, {{maintenance and repair}} of the blow-out preventers (BOPs) and their permanent guide bases. The primary functions of a <b>blow-out</b> <b>preventer</b> system are to confine well fluid to the wellbore, provide a way to add fluid to the wellbore and to allow controlled volumes of fluid to be withdrawn from the wellbore. Dive work includes assistance with guiding the blowout preventer stack (BOP stack) onto the guide base, inspection of the BOP stack, checking connections, troubleshooting malfunctions of the hydraulic, mechanical and electrical systems, and inspection of the rig's anchors.|$|E
50|$|The {{downhole}} fluid {{pressures are}} controlled in modern wells through the balancing of the hydrostatic pressure {{provided by the}} mud column. Should {{the balance of the}} drilling mud pressure be incorrect (i.e., the mud pressure gradient is less than the formation pore pressure gradient), then formation fluids (oil, natural gas and/or water) can begin to flow into the wellbore and up the annulus (the space between the outside of the drill string and the wall of the open hole or the inside of the casing), and/or inside the drill pipe. This is commonly called a kick. Ideally, mechanical barriers such as blowout preventers (BOPs) can be closed to isolate the well while the hydrostatic balance is regained through circulation of fluids in the well. But if the well is not shut in (common term for the closing of the <b>blow-out</b> <b>preventer),</b> a kick can quickly escalate into a blowout when the formation fluids reach the surface, especially when the influx contains gas that expands rapidly with the reduced pressure as it flows up the wellbore, further decreasing the effective weight of the fluid.|$|E

5000|$|When a {{drilling}} oil well encounters high-pressured gas which cannot be contained {{either by the}} weight of the drilling mud or by <b>blow-out</b> <b>preventers,</b> the resulting violent eruption can create a large crater which can swallow up {{a drilling}} rig. This phenomenon is called [...] "cratering" [...] in oil field slang. An example of which is the Darvaza gas crater in Derweze Turkmenistan.|$|R
50|$|The first {{response}} to detecting a kick {{would be to}} isolate the wellbore from the surface by activating the <b>blow-out</b> <b>preventers</b> and closing in the well. Then the drilling crew would attempt to circulate in a heavier kill fluid to increase the hydrostatic pressure (sometimes {{with the assistance of}} a well control company). In the process, the influx fluids will be slowly circulated out in a controlled manner, taking care not to allow any gas to accelerate up the wellbore too quickly by controlling casing pressure with chokes on a predetermined schedule.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assure the {{continued}} development of geothermal resources, many advances in materials technology are required so that high costs resulting from the severe environments encountered during drilling, well completion and energy extraction can be reduced. These needs will become more acute as higher temperature and chemically aggressive fluids are encountered. High priority needs are for lost circulation control and lightweight well completion materials, and tools such as drill pipe protectors, rotating head seals, <b>blow-out</b> <b>preventers,</b> and downhole drill motors. The lack of suitable hydrolytically stable chemical systems that can bond previously developed elastomers to metal reinforcement is a critical but as yet unaddressed impediment {{to the development of}} these tools. In addition, the availability of low cost corrosion and scale-resistant tubular lining materials would greatly enhance transport and energy extraction processes utilizing hypersaline brines.

40|$|Internal waves {{near the}} ocean surface have been {{observed}} {{in many parts of}} the world including the Andaman Sea, Sulu Sea and South China Sea. The factors that cause and propagate these large-amplitude waves include bathymetry, density stratification and ocean currents. Although their effects on floating drilling platforms and their riser systems have not been extensively studied, in the past these waves have seriously disrupted offshore exploration and drilling operations. In particular, a drill pipe was ripped from the <b>Blow-Out</b> <b>Preventer</b> (BOP) and lost during drilling operations in the Andaman Sea. Drilling riser damages were also reported from the South China Sea and other places. The motivations of this study were to find a valid numerical model conforming to the physics of internal waves and to study the effects on offshore drilling semisubmersibles, different types of offshore hull forms and riser systems, including the large diameter cold water pipe of floating Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) systems. The influence of internal waves on offshore systems was studied through nonlinear fully coupled time-domain analysis. The numerical model was implemented in a coupled analysis program where the hull, moorings and riser were considered an integrated system. The program HARP was modified and then utilized to study the effects of the internal wave on the platform global motions and riser system integrity. The study could be useful as future guidance for offshore exploration and operations in areas where the internal wave phenomenon is prominent...|$|E
40|$|A coupled {{model of}} a marine riser and a {{tensioner}} system is built. The riser is modeled using the multi-body dynamics program MSC Adams, and the tensioner system using the powerful controls and systems simulation tool, MSC Easy 5. The hydrodynamic forces on the marine riser are calculated according to linear wave theory, and implemented in the model using a custom made subroutine. The riser is modeled using flexible beam elements according to Timoshenko beam theory. The tensioner system is modeled using moments of fluid system and body mechanics. The system is solved using equations of equilibrium of fluid momentum, mass and energy. For the unfamiliar reader, an introduction to deep sea oil exploration and production is given. Each subsystem included in the model is explained. The mode of working of the more complex subsystems is presented, followed by {{a discussion of the}} simplifications made to include them in the model. The hydrodynamic force module is based on linear potential theory of long waves, and Morison’s equation for oscillating structure in oscillating flow. An introduction to wave theories with derivation of the necessary equations is given, together with a thorough discussion of hydrodynamic coefficients. An introduction to the mechanics of fluid systems is presented, to give the reader the knowledge to understand the underlying principles of the Easy 5 tensioner model. A rough guide to MSC Adams and MSC Easy 5 explaining normal usage of the programs, alterations made to them and use of the 4 subsea interface, is presented. Theory regarding computational methods of solving ordinary differential equations is also offered. Finally all results are verified by analyzing similar models in the widely used and highly acknowledged global analysis program for slender marine structures RIFLEX. Excellent compliancy is found for the hydrodynamic force module and the forced vessel motion subroutine. The coupled marine riser and tensioner model shows how tension between lower marine riser package (LMRP) and <b>blow-out</b> <b>preventer</b> (BOP) becomes a critical parameter. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the real}} {{industry}} project, which {{new technology and}} systems have blossomed and have been codified, many problems and challenges regarding the application of international safety systems standard IEC 61508 in low demand and high demand have been encountered. For instance, automatic train protection system (ATP) is argued to be both low demand system and continuous mode system. A low demand <b>blow-out</b> <b>preventer</b> (BOP) system will operate in high demand mode to withstand the well pressure for hours and weeks when it is activated to full closure. In the real case, both reliability assessments for low and high demand mode could be requested due to the vague and ambiguous statement of concepts and definitions in the IEC standard. Current existing researches put main emphasis on low demand systems, but addresses on high/continuous demand systems are few. This master?s thesis which is written in co-operation with Aker Solutions aims at discussing those problems confronted in IEC 61508 and summarizing the existing academic work, mathematical models as well as relevant industry guideline. By assuming the system will operate in both low demand and high/continuous demand mode, Subsea High Integrity Pressure Protection System as a case example is used to illustrate {{the problems in the}} case study. Both probability of failure on demand (PFD) and probability of dangerous failure per hour (PFH) are calculated by PDS method as the low and high/continuous demand mode reliability assessment. The results from the case study in terms of SIL are found out to be inconsistent. This problem is discussed and traced back to the general quantitative SIL allocation method in IEC 61508 - 5. The thesis therefore attempts to develop a general consistent SIL range by carrying out SIL calibriations with Matlab. New correction factor is calculated and a new proposed SIL table is given. The decisions on following IEC 61508 SIL table is further argued. Both pros and cons of different solutions are compared. </p...|$|E
30|$|The casing {{program is}} the most crucial feature that {{influences}} successful drilling operations and the longevity of the future geothermal fluid production. It implies assessing casing setting depths, a number of casing strings, nominal casing weight, casing material, type of connections and well completion. The main functions of casing programs are preventing casing deformation, supporting <b>blow-out</b> <b>preventers</b> and permanent wellhead, containing drilling and production fluids, preventing groundwater contamination, mitigating drilling fluid losses, protecting wells from corrosion, fracturing and erosion, preventing inter-zonal cross-contamination of geothermal fluids, defining a production zone and providing access to the reservoir (New Zealand Standard 2015). Conventional high-temperature (also called high-enthalpy) geothermal wells consist usually of three–four cemented casing strings. The typical casing program for most geothermal wells incorporates a conductor pipe, a surface casing, an intermediate casing which may serve as an anchor casing (i.e., casing string to which wellhead is attached), a production casing and an optional perforated liner (holed or slotted). All of these casing strings mentioned are cemented from casing shoe to top of casing string to prevent corrosion resulting from migration of reservoir fluids and to control thermal expansion during fluid production. A liner pipe, which is either suspended from a liner hanger or set at the well bottom, is usually left uncemented in the production section of the well. The completion is finalized by assembling a permanent wellhead {{at the top of}} the well. In most cases, it includes an expansion spool placed directly below the first master valve, which allows for expansion of the uppermost parts of the production casing string with respect to the anchor casing to which the permanent wellhead is attached.|$|R

Drilling {{process of}} deep {{borehole}} consists of different drilling operations. Each {{of them can}} cause numerous different drilling problems especially when a borehole is performed. While drilling the most dangerous problems can occur once the drilling fluids (oil, gas or water) spontaneously flow out from the drilled formations into the borehole {{and then to the}} surface. It can also happen that the pressures in the borehole are not balanced and an influx of fluid into the borehole (a kick) will occur. If no action is taken to stop a kick once it begins, then the fluids will be pushed out of the borehole and will be flowing uncontrollably to surface (blow-out). Blow-out is prevented by closing off the well at the surface with special kind of valves (<b>Blow-out</b> <b>Preventers</b> - BOPs). When pressure control over the well is lost, swift action must be taken to avert the severe consequences. These consequences may include: — endangering of human life, — loss of rig and equipment, — negative influence on the environment, — additional costs of bringing the well under control again, — loss of reservoir production.

These procedures and methods depend on the actual drilling operation scenario. One of them can be a tripping operation when the drill string is pulled out or run back again. In this case the drill string is open either after a break-out or before making up the drill pipes and drill collars.

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe present work {{investigates the}} effect of the bending loads on the {{wellhead}} systems and predicts the response of the conductor with the introduction of CAN™ (Conductor Anchor Node) and Seabed BOP Supporter. Performance of the wellhead and conductor system is dependent on field design parameters. These parameters can include local environmental loading, drilling rig motions, marine riser stack-ups and BOP (<b>Blow-out</b> <b>Preventer)</b> configuration and soil conditions. These loads may cause severe damage to the wellhead system. In order to reduce {{the effect of}} these loads, the possibility of incorporating other components such as the CAN™ and Seabed BOP Supporter can be considered. The present work aims at introducing the mentioned CAN™ and Seabed BOP Supporter in the wellhead system and assessing their influence on the bending moment response of the conductor. This has been analyzed considering different load cases outlined below. Load Case 1 : The analysis was carried out considering a conventional drilling mode with a 30 ” wellhead system, drilling riser and a BOP system. Load Case 2 : The analysis was performed considering Wellhead system with BOP and drilling riser supported in a CAN™ foundation developed by NeoDrill AS. Load Case 3 : The analysis also considers Seabed BOP Support in addition to the CAN™. The Seabed BOP Supporter is located in between CAN™ and BOP. The purpose of a Sea bed BOP supporter is to transfer pre-set part of BOP weight directly to CAN™ and to counteract riser induced BOP moments on Wellhead. 3 -D FE (Finite Element) model based on PIPE element was established for the mentioned three load cases. The analyses have been performed by considering various factors that include internal axial casing load, external load from BOP, drilling riser tension, foundation soil support stiffness, and the cement level within the annulus of the conductor and surface casing. The shear loads that occur when the well is configured for drilling operations are applied at the lower flex joint over a range from - 490 kN to + 490 kN. The results from the analysis are discussed against the two criteria established to assess the structural integrity of the wellhead conductor. These criteria are: allowable bending capacity of the conductor and limiting flex joint rotation angles. The results show that the introduction of CAN™ and Seabed BOP Supporter influences the response for bending moment of Wellhead conductor considerably. The results further conclude that the reduction in the bending moment of the conductor is in the order of 25 % and 80 % due to introduction of CAN™ and Seabed BOP Supporter in the wellhead system, respectively...|$|E
40|$|As {{one of the}} key {{components}} for the wellhead integrity, the <b>Blow-out</b> <b>Preventer</b> (BOP) is designed and constructed to prevent abnormal pressure change in the well and keep the blow-out from happening, and therefore is essential for the whole well- being of the offshore drilling system, and this calls for a careful investigation on the understanding of the BOP dynamics and its effect on the whole system. However, due to the complexity of the structure itself, the hydrodynamics of the BOP are difficult to model and therefore is the main focus on this thesis. First a general overview will be given on the challenges of offshore systems during the drilling phase when the BOP is installed directly above the wellhead. The current industrial standard suggested by DNV on the modelling of the BOP will be given. In order to re-evaluate the problem, the non-dimensional analysis will be carried out and the key hydrodynamic effect parameters of the KC number, [beta] number and the angle of attack [alpha] will be identified. First sets of the experiments on scale-down BOP model conducted in the MIT Towing Tank show that the experimental measured hydrodynamic coefficients are drastically different from the industrial recommended modeling coefficients that the added mass coefficient Cm and the drag coefficient Cd both have a much larger value than the industrial model provided, and they vary significantly as the function of the key parameters. An equivalent box model was built and tested to capture the external shape of the BOP and used to address unusual hydrodynamic behavior. The box experiments successfully captured some major trends of the BOP model. It revealed that, first, the externally rectangle shape of the BOP will {{have a major impact on}} the variation of the added mass coefficient; second, the BOP model works in the range of overall laminar flow regime and thus, results in an inversely proportional relationship between the drag coefficient and KC number. However, the box model does not exhibit the large values of drag and added mass coefficient found in the BOP, which must be attributed to the multi-component structure of the BOP and the hydrodynamic interaction of the components. This was later confirmed through numerical and experimental visualization. Experiments on a model consisting of multiple cylinders exposed to the oscillatory flow are carried out in the MIT towing tank with varying parameters on KC number, [beta] number, Gap ratio and angle of attack [alpha]. Experimental results show that for side-by-side, at certain gap ratio, the drag coefficient of each cylinder will experience an increase, compared to the hydrodynamic of the single cylinder. This confirmed the BOP multi-structure hydrodynamic interaction effect. Also numerical work has been carried out through a 2 D BDIM code, named Lilypad. The result confirms the experimental work, revealing that the increase in the drag coefficient is due to the formation of a jet between the Karman streets of the two adjacent cylinders. by Dixia Fan.

40|$|The {{object of}} this master thesis is to {{investigate}} a drilling riser exposed to currents, waves and vessel motions at different water depths. The aim is to develop an advisory system for vessel position based on the riser response and also to better predict the transition from operation to a potential disconnect. The advisory system will make use of watch circles which define the limits for normal operation, halt in operation and a possible disconnect. As the most accessible oil reservoirs are exploited, {{there is a need}} for drilling operations at ever greater water depths and in harsher environments. The riser, and its interactions with the vessel and the <b>blow-out</b> <b>preventer</b> (BOP), is a crucial element in a drilling operation. In order to ensure a safe and productive operation, the riser top and bottom angles must be within acceptable limits. For excessive angles, a disconnect from the well is carried out. This will imply a major loss of income, and it is therefore highly undesirable to disconnect when not necessary. However, the consequences of not disconnecting when necessary are even more severe. The riser is exposed to currents, waves and vessel motions which cause it to deflect. The effect from these influences must be investigated in order to predict the riser angles in various conditions and thereby develop watch circles taking these angles into account. The riser has been modeled and analyzed in RIFLEX, a software program developed at MARINTEK for static and dynamic analysis of slender marine structures. In order to investigate the response in both shallow and deep waters, water depths of 300 and 2000 [m] have been applied. The riser is exposed to unidirectional current, regular waves and vessel motions. The top tension is kept constant for each water depth. At 300 [m] water depth, the riser was found to be highly affected by vessel offsets, and the control objective for this depth must be to avoid any offset. At 2000 [m] water depth, however, both lower and upper angle will stabilize at acceptable magnitudes for the maximum static vessel offset studied in this thesis. The upper angle will however be excessive during the movement. The lower angle will not immediately respond to a motion at the top end of the riser, and it increases slowly for an increasing vessel offset. Hence, for a drive-off, which is an uncontrolled excursion of the vessel due to a failure in the DP system, the DP operator will have some time before a disconnect has to be carried out. The current affects the riser considerably more in deep waters compared to shallow waters. Also, first-order waves affect the upper angle significantly more than the lower angle, both in shallow and deep water. The watch circles which have been developed prove that the limits for a halt in the operation and a possible disconnect are larger than the conventional guidance limits. By allowing the top angle to become excessive during a limited amount of time, one can uphold the operation for a longer period of time, and also avoid an unnecessary disconnect. The main contributions in this thesis are the simulation study of the drilling riser and the proposed guidance limits for operation and disconnect.  </p...|$|E
