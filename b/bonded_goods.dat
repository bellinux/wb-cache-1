50|$|In 1858 Rockhampton {{was officially}} proclaimed a port by the Government of New South Wales (the {{separation}} of Queensland {{did not occur}} until 1859). The collection of Customs duties and the storage of <b>bonded</b> <b>goods</b> {{was carried out in}} a prefabricated timber building which was despatched from the Government of New South Wales. A reserve was declared where the Customs House of 1899 was built, and another timber building was constructed as the Queen's warehouse. The area of the Customs House formed a focal point for transaction of commerce with frontages onto both Quay Street and Little Quay Street (later Quay Lane), and dominating the strip of properties with water frontage.|$|E
5000|$|The Kent Street Building {{was built}} as a store for {{the owner of the}} land, Robert Travis, of the {{wholesale}} and retail firm, Robert Travis and Co. On completion of the store, the Maryborough Chronicle (20 June 1868) published the following description:"The facade carries two cornices, an upper and a lower one - the former supported by ornamental trusses, the latter corbelled out, the members of both exceedingly bold and massive in detail, giving an appearance of great solidity to the whole building. An exceedingly light close-boarded, and slated king-post roof - a peculiar feature in which is the entire absence of all common rafters - covers the building. In the rear of the main store, and attached thereto, is a brick wine and spirit store, and beyond that a packing-house, built of the same material. A splendid water supply is secured by a large circular brick tank having a depth of 22 feet (6.7 m) with a diameter of 11 feet (3.4 m). ... The store on the ground floor is a splendid room 15 feet (4.6 m) high, extending over the whole of the building, with the exception that an office occupies a space of 15 by 15 feet (4.6 by 4.6 m) of the lower end. Two rows of handsome iron columns add to the ornament of this large room, {{and at the same time}} give solidity to the floor of the upper storey. Access to this upper storey is made by a staircase at the lower end of the building, on mounting which it will be seen the whole floor forms one large room, except that in the centre an opening has been left for facilitating communication between the two rooms, the opening being surrounded with a light elegant balustrade. The internal fittings are all of French-polished cedar, most of it grown in the district..."The Middle Warehouse was also built for Travis. The Maryborough Chronicle (2 March 1869) gave the following description of the building:"(It) is a massive two-storeyed pile, of the utmost solidity and security that bricks and mortar, laid in the very best manner, can ensure, with a slate roof of correspondingly durable appearance. The dimensions are 100 feet (30.5 m) long by 30 feet (9 m) wide, the lower story being devoted to the reception of <b>bonded</b> <b>goods,</b> and the upper one, which contains two apartments, to the purpose of an ordinary warehouse." [...] In 1879, drapers Rutledge and Netterfield (later Netterfield and Palmer) acquired the site and it was subsequently occupied by a number of commercial or light industrial operations before being sold at auction to CF Gataker of Graham and Gataker on 20 February 1885. Graham and Gataker subsequently acquired land behind the Middle Warehouse fronting Wharf Street.|$|E

The Life and Times of the Steamboat Red Cloud extends our {{understanding}} of the upper Missouri during the decisive period of settlement and trade in the steamboat era from 1859 to the arrival of railroads in the mid- 1880 s. This important book views the development of the American and Canadian Rockies from a maritime perspective. Journalist-historian Joel Overholser earlier emphasized the importance of the Canadian trade to Fort Benton. Corbin develops that theme through the great St. Louis-Fort Benton trading company, I. G. Baker 2 ̆ 6 Company, and its flagship steamer Red Cloud. Mining NorthWest Mounted Police records at the National Archives of Canada, Corbin documents and develops the earlier theories. As the Canadian West opened in the mid- 1870 s, I. G. Baker 2 ̆ 6 Company gained approval for a bonded line for the shipment of goods from England and eastern Canada to the Northwest Territories as a way to avoid international trade tariffs. <b>Bonded</b> <b>goods,</b> North-West Mounted Police recruits, and Canadian government payrolls were all carried on Baker Line boats to Fort Benton and then freighted over the Whoop-Up Trail into western Canada.

40|$|For {{high-temperature}} ultrasonic transducers piezoelement-to-metal thermosonic {{bonding technology}} was developed based on gold-to-gold diffusion. Bond quality strongly depends on bonding parameters – pressure, temperature, ultrasonic power and time. The first step for achieving <b>good</b> <b>bonds</b> was ultrasonic {{monitoring of the}} process. In ultrasonic transducers <b>good</b> diffusion <b>bond</b> means <b>good</b> acoustic coupling of piezoelement to the protector and this coupling must withstand high temperatures. Bond quality tests comprise piezoelement electrodes adhesion issues as well. Bismuth titanate and PZT piezoelements were bonded to thick stainless steel protectors and membranes. For bond quality determination normal-incidence immersion scanning method from metal side was chosen. It is based on measurement of reflection/transmission signals in the bond interface and determination of their ratio which defines acoustic coupling. The whole piezoelement bonding interface was scanned automatically in x and y directions with respect to 10 MHz wideband ultrasonic transducer, having lateral beam width 1. 4 mm at – 6 dB level. With optimal <b>bonding</b> parameters <b>good</b> <b>bond</b> quality was found. Weak or non-bonded areas are absent.

40|$|A {{method and}} a system for testing the bonding of foam {{insulation}} attached to metal is described. The system {{involves the use of}} an impacter which has a calibrated load cell mounted on a plunger and a hammer head mounted {{on the end of the}} plunger. When the impacter strikes the insulation at a point to be tested, the load cell measures the force of the impact and the precise time interval during which the hammer head is in contact with the insulation. This information is transmitted as an electrical signal to a load cell amplifier where the signal is conditioned and then transmitted to a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analyzer. The FFT analyzer produces energy spectral density curves which are displayed on a video screen. The termination frequency of the energy spectral density curve may be compared with a predetermined empirical scale to determine whether a igh quality <b>bond,</b> <b>good</b> <b>bond,</b> or debond is present at the point of impact...|$|R

40|$|A new local property, {{the local}} {{electron}} attachment energy [E(r) ], is introduced and is demonstrated to, {{be a useful}} guide to predict intermolecular interactions and chemical reactivity. The E(r) {{is analogous to the}} average local ionization energy but indicates susceptibility toward interactions with nucleophiles rather than electrophiles. The functional form E(r) is motivated based on Janak's theorem and the piecewise linear energy dependence of electron addition to atomic and molecular systems. Within the generalized Kohn-Sham method (GKS-DFT), only the virtual orbitals with negative eigenvalues contribute to E(r). In the, present study, E(r) has been computed from orbitals obtained from GKS-DFT computations with a hybrid exchange correlation functional. It is shown that E(r) computed on a molecular isodengty surface, E-S(r), reflects the regioselectivity and relative reactivity for nucleophilic aromatic substitution, nucleophilic addition to activated double bonds, and formation of halogen <b>bonds.</b> <b>Good</b> to excellent correlations between experimental or theoretical measures of interaction strengths and minima in E-S(r) (E-S,E-min) are demonstrated.
