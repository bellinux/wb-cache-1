40|$|Lithography in {{the minds}} of most people is a method of {{reproducing}} a photograph or artwork by means of a halftone screen. The screen, usually no finer than 400 lines per inch reproduces the image by varying degrees of density through control of the dot size. With screenless printing the image is reproduced without the screen, resulting in much better detail. The purpose of this thesis is to determine what type of plate material will work best with the 2 ̆ 2 Association Product Coating 2 ̆ 2, since the ST Sumner Williams plate that worked well with this coating is no longer produced. The criterion for a good plate is that it produce a full range of densities and run cleanly. This study is to determine whether a finely grained plate such as the <b>brush</b> <b>grain,</b> is the plate to use with the coating. Testing was done at different coating concentrations, different exposure times with different plate materials, and with different concentrations of prime coats. It was also theorized that perhaps the sensitizer {{had something to do with}} how the coating performed. The concentra tion of the sensitizer was varied in each test to see how much of a change there was. The test did prove that the coating worked with the finer grained plates, and that prime coats would reduce the amount of scrumming on the plate. It was also found that a one percent concentration of sensitizer worked the best...|$|R

40|$|Antelope’ (Reg. no. CV- 968, PI 633910) {{is a hard}} white {{winter wheat}} (Triticum aestivum L.) {{cultivar}} developed cooperatively by USDA-ARS, the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, and the Wyoming Agricultural Experiment Station. Antelope has shown exceptional productivity under irrigated trials in western Nebraska, eastern Wyoming, and eastern Colorado. It combines high grain yield under irrigation with excellent lodging resistance. Antelope {{was derived from the}} cross ‘Pronghorn’/‘Arlin’. Pronghorn (PI 593047, Baenziger et al., 1997) is a strong gluten hard red winter wheat developed by the University of Nebraska. Arlin (PI 564246, Sears et al., 1997) is a hard white winter wheat developed by Kansas State University. Antelope was produced from a cross made in 1993. F 1 through F 3 generations were advanced by the bulk pedigree method. From the F 3 generation, 100 single-plant-progeny rows were planted. Antelope subsequently was selected from one of these rows as a single F 3 –derived F 4 line and assigned the experimental number NW 97 S 278. Breeder seed originated from a composite of 30 F 9 –derived headrows which were selected for uniformity in plant type and grain color. Antelope is awned and white-glumed. The glume beak is awned, and the shoulder is elevated to apiculate. Kernels are elliptical, with a narrow, mid-deep crease, rounded beak, and mid-sized <b>brush.</b> <b>Grain</b> samples provided to USDA-GIPSA were classified as hard white, with color characteristics acceptable for this class. Antelope contains approximately 0. 1 % hard red grain and also contains tall off-types at a frequency of approximately 0. 5 %. Coleoptile length (37 mm) is shorter than that of Pronghorn (66 mm), and similar to that of ‘Nuplains’ (36 mm). Average plant height (81 cm) is shorter than that of ‘Arapahoe’ (92 cm) but greater than that of Nuplains (78 cm) ...|$|R
50|$|Graining is the {{practice}} of imitating wood grain on a non-wood surface {{in order to increase}} that surface's aesthetic appeal. Graining was common in the 19th century, as people were keen on imitating hard, expensive woods by applying a superficial layer of paint onto soft, inexpensive woods. Graining can be accomplished using either rudimentary tools or highly specialized tools. A specialized thick <b>brush</b> used for <b>graining</b> is often called a mottler. It is carried out in layers, with the first layer being a base, and then a second layer applied later, today usually by means of a sponge. During the 19th century, however, brushes were more commonly used. It can also be applied on bricks and brass, as is more common today.|$|R

In Costa Rica, rice bran is a mixture of rice polishings and rice bran, without the broken rice and contain all the layers of the rice obtained in the milling operation of <b>brushing</b> the <b>grain</b> to polish the kernel. It may contain small quantity of hulls and germ of the rice. It must contain no less than 9 % of crude protein and no more than 13 % of crude fiber. The data show an availability of rice bran of 16. 800 tons with an average protein content of 13. 6 % and 8. 5 % of crude fiber. The digestible energy swine was 3924 Kcal/kg of dry matter and 3340 Kcal/kg of dry matter of metabolizable energy for poultry. The brewers rice (polished and broken grain) and the rice hulls showed a chemical analysis typical for this type of products' It is suggested to control the marketing of rice bran mixtured with gro. rlá hulls which is illegal in CostaRica' It should be marketed as "bran with hulis"...|$|R

This thesis aims to determine whether signal crayfish {{have the potential to}} also impact the physical environment in rivers. A series of experiments were undertaken in purpose-built still-water aquaria using a laser scanner to obtain Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of narrowly-graded gravel surfaces before and after exposure to crayfish. The difference between DEMs was used to quantify volumetric changes in surface topography due to crayfish activity. Two distinct types of topographic change were identified. The first was the construction of pits and mounds which resulted in an increase in surface roughness and grain exposure. The second was the rearrangement of surface material caused by crayfish <b>brushing</b> past <b>grains</b> when walking and foraging, reorientating grains and altering friction angles. A series of 80 flume runs were undertaken to quantify alterations made by crayfish to water-worked, as well as loose, gravel substrates at low velocity flows. Crayfish significantly altered the structure of water-worked substrates, reversing the imbrication of surface grains to a more random arrangement. Surfaces were entrained at a relatively high velocity flow subsequent to crayfish activity in order to directly link topographic and structural alterations to substrate stability. Nearly twice as many grains were mobilised from surfaces which had been disturbed by crayfish in comparison to control surfaces that were not exposed to crayfish. A field investigation aimed to determine the potential significance of the geomorphic impact of crayfish in rivers. Signal crayfish were tracked through a 20 m reach of a small, lowland alluvial river for 150 days using a Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) system. Crayfish were active throughout the channel, although their activity became limited as water temperature dropped and flow stage increased. Substrate was not an important determinant of crayfish activity at this scale. Instead, crayfish tended to be found along the inner bank of a meander bend where there was a substantial cover of macrophytes. Consequently, signal crayfish were active for extended periods on substrates of a similar size to those that they could disturb in flume experiments. These results suggest that signal crayfish could have important geomorphic effects in rivers, disturbing bed structures and increasing the mobility of coarse material. This may have important implications for both the management of some rivers and benthic organisms that reside on the river bed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
50|$|A dull polish is {{procured}} by rubbing beeswax {{into the}} wood. It must be thoroughly rubbed in, a little turpentine being added as a lubricant when the rubber works stiffly. If paint were applied over the bare knots of new wood {{it would be}} destroyed, or at least discolored, by the exudation of resin from the knots. For the purpose of obviating this the knots are covered with two coats of a preparation called knotting, made by dissolving shellac in methylated spirit. Putty is required for stopping nail-holes and small crevices and irregularities in woodwork. It is made of powdered whiting and linseed oil mixed together and kneaded into a stiff paste. For light work hard stopping, made of white lead and whiting, should be employed. The tools and appliances of the painter are mixing pots, paint kettles to hold the color for the painter at work, strainer, palette knife, scraping knife, hacking, stopping and chisel knives, the hammer, sponge, pumice, blow-lamp for burning off, {{and a variety of}} brushes, such as the duster, the ground brush, the tool, the distemper brush, the fitch and camel-hair pencil for picking out small parts and lines, the sable and flogger for gilding, the stippler; for grained work several steel graining combs with coarse and fine teeth, <b>graining</b> <b>brush</b> of hogs' hair, pencil over-grainer, and other special shaped brushes used to obtain the peculiar characteristics of different woods.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. October 2010. Major. Political Science. Advisor: Raymond Duvall. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 197 pages. Ill. (some col.) The post Cold War world witnessed the exponential {{growth in the}} range of issues and domains that became security concerns. A long list of objects [...] the nation, poverty, the human, health, food, the environment [...] is now firmly incorporated into the global security agenda. As the list of dangers expanded, security itself transmogrified into a medium through which we orient ourselves toward life, politics, and the world. In this dissertation, I argue that what is needed is not more security, but to dismantle the whole architecture of security so as to open up a space for a thought of politics that admits the fact that we can never be secure. To develop this argument, I first map out the landscape of the contemporary empire of security and then provide an overview of critical approaches to security within the discipline of International Relations, where I point out the paradoxical way in which the hegemony of security gets reproduced in these discussions despite the overarching concerns voiced about the complicity of security in the orders of power and violence. This is followed by a discussion of the meaning of dismantling security as an untimely critique. By drawing on historical materialist conceptions of time, I formulate the first sense of the untimely as a politics of time that seeks to counter the temporal structure enacted by the politics of security. Then I discuss the second sense of the untimely, which centers on the relationship between critical thinking and political time. I clarify what it means to <b>brush</b> against the <b>grain</b> of the doxa of security by being untimely in a disciplinary context and refusing to write security. I close by elaborating on three different conceptions of politics once the ground is cleared from security and formulate them as three moves that deconstruct the subject, the space, and the time of security by drawing on the works of scholars such as David Campbell, Michael Dillon, Jacques Rancière, and Jacques Derrida...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{freeze drying}} (AFD) is the {{lyophilization}} {{of a product}} at atmospheric pressure conditions and temperatures ranging generally between - 15 and - 5 ◦C (avoiding, thereby, ice melting). The quality of the obtained dried products is quite similar {{to the quality of}} products dried by vacuum freeze drying (VFD), but without the need of generating vacuum, maintaining temperatures around - 50 ◦C in the condenser, or defrosting it. There are several ways to carry out AFD, {{such as the use of}} a fluidized bed or a tunnel conveyor. Nevertheless, AFD involves considerably longer drying times than VFD, and the process must be modified in some way in order to shorten them without loss of product quality at the same time. Moreover, since this process is usually carried out with air at very low temperatures, it can saturate rapidly. This situation leads to a reduction of the gradient of water concentration between air and product surface, and consequently, a diminution of the mass transfer rate. The use of an adsorbent material compatible with the food product (i. e., not toxic for human consumption) in a fluidized bed, could constitute an alternative for using other extra energy supplies (such as IR application, or heat pump). At the same time, the use of the adsorbent medium presents two additional advantages: the first, as the heat of adsorption of water vapour is of the same order of magnitude than sublimation heat of ice, no additional energy supply is necessary; second, it acts as adsorbent medium for generated water vapour, allowing air recirculation, which means an additional reduction of operative costs. In particular, non-food wheat bran is an interesting material to be applied as adsorbent in this process; this adsorbent is not only compatible with foodstuff, but also, since it is a by-product of the cereal processing industry, it is cheap and can be easily discarded (and reused, for example, in compost) without recovering it by means of a thermal treatment. Nonetheless, as it is the hard outer layer of cereals consisting of combined aleurone and pericarp, its particles exhibit a very irregular plane shape, with rests of <b>grain</b> <b>brush</b> and, in some cases, broken pericarp. These characteristics confer to the particle a rough surface and, as undesired consequence, the possibility of mechanical interaction during fluidization. However, when two different materials are fluidized in a fluidized bed, the mixture may undergo segregation, causing a poor contact between the adsorbent and the food particles. Thus, instead of using a traditional fluidized bed, a spout-fluid bed (an apparatus similar to the spouted bed, with lateral air injectors beside the main jet) may be utilized, and thereby enhancing mixing. On the other hand, CFD simulation would offer a great potential for simulating the AFD process, its optimization from the fluid dynamic point of view, and the design of new equipment. Various investigators have been working on the application of CFD models for simulating AFD in fluidized bed. However, in general, they simulated a single piece of foodstuff, but not the complete system with air, food material, and adsorbent (when it is applied). The general objectives of the PhD work are to determine the hydrodynamic conditions under which AFD in adsorbent fluidized bed is feasible, and to obtain a first approach to a CFD model of the process. Particularly, the study of the hydrodynamics of the process (non-food wheat bran fluidization behaviour, and mixing of binary mixtures) in a fluidized bed as well as in a spout-fluid bed is aimed from the experimental point of view, while the evaluation of the possibility of simulation by means of a CFD code of the AFD process by immersion in adsorbent medium in a fluidized bed is intended in the theoretical field. Unlike sand or other materials in which regular bubbles are formed, non-food wheat bran exhibits canalization or preferent...|$|R
