40|$|The new dredge for {{collecting}} meiobenthonic animals, Dragonet II, {{which is now}} in the final experimental stage was tested at a 50 m deep station off Seto-Zaki about 3. 2 km south of the Seto Marine Biological Laboratory on the morning of June 13, 1966. In the material collected by a 10 minute dragging, six spadellas were found in the <b>bottom</b> <b>net</b> sample and one in the top net sample. These spadellas are all devoid of a prominent cement gland at the aperture of the seminal receptacle. The lateral fin is always extended anteriorly beyond the trunk-tail septum for a conside-rable length.

40|$|The Gochi net is {{commonly}} operated off {{the west coast}} of Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. Its construction can be divided into two types; with and without a bag. The net without a bag is operated in areas with a rough bottom and complicate configuration. In operating this net, factors which should be taken into consideration include the length of bottom contact, minimum distance between the net and artificial reef, and variation of net mouth. The net operation was analyzed through data from underwater camera and video, tension, depth, and net mouth height meters. The net mouth height at the time of bottom contact was 10 - 16 m. During hauling it decreased to 3 - 6 m. At the time of lift off the <b>bottom,</b> <b>net</b> mouth height ranged from 0. 5 - 1. 0 m. At this point, fishes were caught in the net. The tension during bottom contact was 10 - 20 kg. During hauling it increased to 25 - 50 kg. Upon lifting off it increased to 60 - 100 kg. Wing distance became narrow after lifting off the bottom. This caused schools of fishes which were in front of the net mouth to become frightened and entangled in the net bunt. Under operating conditions, the net mouth looked like a "tongue", and the phase of hauling like a scoop. Over all hauling rate of the net is shown to be 3 - 5 m/s, which were good condition of net mouth height when the fishes were caught in the front of net and over artificial reef area...|$|E
25|$|Large {{numbers of}} smooth lanternsharks, {{predominantly}} juvenile, are caught incidentally by commercial longline fisheries, {{and to a}} lesser extent in bottom trawls and fixed <b>bottom</b> <b>nets,</b> in the eastern Atlantic and off Japan. This species is one of the three most common sharks caught as bycatch in deepwater fisheries off southern Portugal, along with the velvet belly lanternshark (E. spinax) and the blackmouth catshark (Galeus melastomus). Most captured smooth lanternsharks are discarded, although some may be sold dried and salted for human consumption or processed into fishmeal. The smooth lanternshark's slow rates of reproduction and growth may render it vulnerable to population collapse under sustained fishing pressure. However, catch rates currently show no evidence of this occurring, which, coupled with the smooth lanternshark's wide geographic range, has led to the IUCN assessing it as of Least Concern.|$|R

40|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the presence of Tursiops truncatus in fishing areas represents a real economic threat to fishermen due the dolphin feeding on the entangled fish, damaging the nets and reducing the fish catch.

50|$|Drift netting is {{a fishing}} {{technique}} where nets, called drift nets, hang vertically {{in the water}} column without being anchored to the <b>bottom.</b> The <b>nets</b> are kept vertical in the water by floats attached to a rope {{along the top of the}} net and weights attached to another rope along the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>net.</b> Drift nets generally rely on the entanglement properties of loosely affixed netting. Folds of loose netting, much like a window drapery, snag on a fish's tail and fins and wrap the fish up in loose netting as it struggles to escape. However the nets can also function as gill nets if fish are captured when their gills get stuck in the net. The size of the mesh varies depending on the fish being targeted. These nets usually target schools of pelagic fish.|$|R

40|$|Sixty-two {{verified}} reports {{obtained in}} the years 1990 - 1999 on the bycatch, strandings and sightings of harbour porpoises in the Polish Baltic were analysed in this study. In relative terms the highest number of reports (22) was noted in Puck Bay. Forty-five (72. 6 %) reports referred to specimens from bycatch, 10 (16. 1 %) were individuals observed at sea, and 7 (11. 3 %) were stranded.  A large proportion (42. 2 %) of the bycatch occurred in the fishing grounds of Puck Bay. Forty carcasses of harbour porpoises were obtained for further analysis. Most of the bycatch took place from December to April with a maximum in March. In {{the rest of the}} year there were 1 to 3  bycaught animals reported per month with no cases of bycatch in June. Taking into account data on fishing effort collected for the study area it appears that by far the greatest threat to harbour porpoises is posed by nets used for salmonids. Among all the bycaught animals, most (40. 0 %)  perished in salmon semi-drift nets. A considerable number of the harbour porpoises perished in <b>bottom</b> set <b>nets</b> for cod (33. 3 %) while only a single bycatch event was reported from herring trawl nets. To assess the danger from different fishing gear and to determine the areas where the threats are the highest, direct observation of the fisheries was conducted. In the course of boat inspections various types of fishing gear were identified and geographical positions of 1, 069 nets were marked. The majority (92 %) consisted of semi-drift nets for sea trout and salmon. Relatively low rates of bycatch were reported from <b>bottom</b> set <b>nets,</b> which had a density over 20 times less than that of surface salmon nets in the area in the autumn months. The density and distribution of both types of nets in the surveyed area was comparable during autumn and winter, when the majority of bycaught animals in <b>bottom</b> set <b>nets</b> were reported...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The piked dogfish Squalus acanthias {{is part of}} the bycatch {{of several}} South American {{longline}} fisheries, although in Argentina, it was only reported in the bycatch of benthic and demersal fisheries operating <b>bottom</b> <b>nets.</b> This communication represents the first record of S. acanthias bycatch in a commercial semi-pelagic longline fishery within Argentinean waters. In October-November 2005, 185 piked dogfish were captured (122 females and 63 males). The es-timated mean catch rate was 0. 37 sharks/ 1000 hooks (544, 320 hooks deployed). Nearly half of the captured females and over 50 % of captured males were morphometrically mature. The piked dogfish bycatch could have been influenced by the use of the Argentine shortfin squid Illex argentinus as bait; this squid {{is part of the}} shark’s natural diet. Although S. acanthias is abundant in the region, we believe that the bycatch species could be more vulnerable than the targeted ones since the signs indicating a declining population of non-target species in commercial catches and collapses in bycatch populations go unnoticed.

40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 389 – 404 The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} changes in an estuarine fish community caused by blooms of the dinoflagellate Akashiwo sanguinea. Samples were collected before, {{during and after}} the red tide using seine nets and surface and <b>bottom</b> <b>nets</b> in three areas near the affected area. The area was around the mouth of the Paraguaçu River. A total of 144 samples were collected, containing 1, 989 individuals, with a total weight of 51. 4 kg, belonging to 42 species in 29 families. During the red tide, fish density, richness and biomass decreased significantly. Atherinella brasiliensis and Sphoeroides greeleyi were the most abundant species during the red tide, indicating some possible resistance to the effects of the red tide. One month after the red tide, there was a rapid recovery of the density, biomass and richness of fish, and Cetengraulis edentulus was the most captured species. An important result of the present study is the finding that the dynamics of small populations of fish are often influenced by fortuitous events, and stochasticity may dominate. The establishment of a continuous and adequate monitoring program in the area may contribute to understanding the effects of red tides on fish population dynamics...|$|R
