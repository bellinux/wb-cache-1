5|$|The {{setting for}} the {{painting}} is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, {{a house in the}} village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.|$|E

Tony David proved ineffectual in civilian life, unable to find a suitable job, and ran up debts, partly from a failed business venture. The earlier spark in the relationship soon died, and they were living separately by 1948.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Joan of Arc, Etty's health continued to deteriorate. He continued to paint and exhibit, but his retirement plans grew firmer. In April 1846 he <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> Coney Street, central York, as a retirement home, and in December 1847 he formally resigned from the Council of the Royal Academy. Following structural alterations {{to give him a}} better view of the river, Etty moved into the house in June 1848, completing the move in September of that year, although he retained his London apartments. His move from London caused some consternation among that city's models, who were losing one of their most regular customers, as well as concerns from Etty who was worried that working with nude models might cause a scandal in York.|$|E
5|$|Mengele and the Stammers {{bought a}} house {{on a farm in}} Caieiras in 1969, with Mengele as half owner.

The Stammers had a falling out with Mengele in late 1974 and <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> São Paulo; Mengele was not invited. The Stammers bought a bungalow in the Eldorado neighbourhood of São Paulo, which they rented out to Mengele.

5|$|The couple {{moved to}} London in 1933 {{but the city}} {{at the time was}} sooty and foggy.

After recovering, she moved to Southampton to stay with her parents for two years, with Denning visiting every weekend. By 1935 she had fully recovered, and the couple <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> Tylers Green, Cuckfield, called Fair Close. Their son, Robert, was born on 3 August 1938; he later became a Dean at Magdalen College, Oxford, teaching inorganic chemistry. Mary developed gallstones in 1941, and after an initial recovery had a haemorrhage on 21 November, dying the next morning.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Murphy was a loner with {{mood swings}} and an {{explosive}} temper. He {{grew up in}} Texas, around Farmersville, Greenville, and Celeste, where he attended elementary school. His father drifted {{in and out of}} the family's life and eventually deserted them. Murphy dropped out of school in fifth grade and got a job picking cotton for a dollar a day to help support his family; he also became skilled with a rifle, hunting small game to help feed them. After his mother died of endocarditis and pneumonia in 1941, he worked at a radio repair shop and at a combination general store, garage and gas station in Greenville. Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Children's Home, a Christian orphanage in Quinlan. After the war, he <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> Farmersville for his oldest sister Corinne and her husband Poland Burns. His other siblings briefly shared the home.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Baxter {{heard that}} the New South Wales University of Technology {{was looking for a}} {{professor}} of chemical engineering. He applied, and was offered the job. Baxter and his family packed their belongings and sailed to Australia on the ocean liner Orcades, arriving in Sydney on 16 January 1950. They <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> Enfield, where Baxter would reside {{for the rest of his}} life. At the time the university was located in temporary accommodation on the grounds of the Sydney Technical College campus in Ultimo. Baxter became the head of a new School of Chemical Engineering that was created on his arrival, but he initially had only one full-time staff member as most of the instruction was carried out by part-time staff. Although he had no previous teaching experience, he turned out to be a good, well-organised lecturer, and he worked closely with his first postgraduate students, whose research was into fields that Baxter had been involved with in England.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930s, Walton's {{relationship}} with the Sitwells became less close. He had love affairs and new friendships that drew him out of their orbit. His first long affair was with Imma von Doernberg, the young widow of a German baron. She and Walton met in the late 1920s and they were together until 1934, when she left him. His later affair with Alice, Viscountess Wimborne (born 1880), which lasted from 1934 until her death in April 1948, caused a wider breach between Walton and the Sitwells, as she disliked {{them as much as}} they disliked her. By the 1930s, Walton was earning enough from composing to allow him financial independence for the first time. A legacy from a musical benefactress in 1931 further enhanced his finances, and in 1934 he left the Sitwells' house and <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> Belgravia.|$|E
5|$|Shirley Williams's {{political}} career (the House of Commons regularly sat until 10 pm) {{meant that the}} couple {{spent a lot of}} time apart. They <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> Furneux Pelham, Hertfordshire, near the border with north Cambridgeshire, while she lived in Phillimore Place during the week to be close to the Houses of Parliament. Sunday was often the only day they were together. The differences in their personal values– he was an atheist, she a Catholic– placed a further strain on their relationship. It reached breaking point in 1970 when Williams formed a relationship with Patricia Law Skinner, a commissioning editor for Cambridge University Press and wife of the historian Quentin Skinner. She had approached Williams to write the opposing view of utilitarianism for Utilitarianism: For and Against with J. J. C. Smart (1973), and they had fallen in love.|$|E
5|$|Leslie Richard Groves Jr. {{was born}} in Albany, New York, on 17 August 1896, the third son of four {{children}} of a pastor, Leslie Richard Groves Sr., and his wife Gwen née Griffith. A descendant of French Huguenots who came to America in the 17th century, Leslie Groves Sr. resigned as pastor of the Sixth Presbyterian church in Albany in December 1896 to become a United States Army chaplain. He was posted to the 14th Infantry at Vancouver Barracks in Washington in 1897. Following {{the outbreak of the}} Spanish–American War in 1898, Chaplain Groves was sent to Cuba with the 8th Infantry. On returning to Vancouver Barracks, he was ordered to rejoin the 14th Infantry in the Philippines; service in the Philippine–American War and the Boxer Rebellion followed. The 14th Infantry returned to the United States in 1901 and moved to Fort Snelling, Minnesota. The family relocated to there from Vancouver, then moved to Fort Hancock, New Jersey, the next year, and returned to Vancouver in 1905. Chaplain Groves was hospitalized with tuberculosis at Fort Bayard in 1905. He decided to settle in southern California and <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> Altadena. His next posting was to Fort Apache, Arizona. The family spent their summers there and returned to Altadena where the children attended school.|$|E
