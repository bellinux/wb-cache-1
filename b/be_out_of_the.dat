5|$|Peter Emmerson, a {{historian}} and {{supporter of the}} desertion theory, asks why Wilson would have sent three of his men away at such a precarious moment. JP Lott, another historian, comments that Wilson had sent runners to Forbes twice the previous night, when he was already at very close quarters with the Matabele and with far fewer men; he surmises {{that it would not}} <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary for the major to do so again. In his evaluation John O'Reilly asks why Wilson sent Gooding back with the two Americans; surely Burnham and Ingram, both seasoned scouts, were enough? Gooding writes in his account that Wilson originally only asked Burnham to ride to Forbes, and that Captain Judd suggested to Wilson that Burnham should take two men with him. The Chief of Scouts requested Ingram, and Borrow asked Gooding to go too. Burnham also says that Borrow sent Gooding.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} {{lieutenant}} governor {{was created in}} 1868, abolished in 1875, and recreated in 1901. According to the current constitution, should the governor <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state for more than 20 days, the lieutenant governor becomes acting governor, and if the office of governor becomes vacant the lieutenant governor ascends to the governorship. Earlier constitutions said {{the powers of the}} governor devolved upon the successor, rather than them necessarily becoming governor, but the official listing includes these as full governors. The governor and lieutenant governor are not elected on the same ticket.|$|E

40|$|<b>Being</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop <b>is</b> a form {{of partial}} ostracism that leads to lower need {{satisfaction}} (Jones, Carter-Sowell, Kelly, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, 2009). Research has shown that people experience lower need satisfaction when they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop on pop culture (Iannone, Kelly, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, in preparation). Five studies expanded on previous research by exploring theoretical issues and potential boundary conditions. Study 1 developed a new method and explored theoretical foundations <b>of</b> being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop on pop culture - whether being unfamiliar makes people feel worse or whether being familiar makes people feel better. This study also looked at whether {{people need to be}} told that others recognize the pop culture stimuli. Study 2 explored whether <b>the</b> feeling <b>of</b> failure associated with feeling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop can <b>be</b> eliminated, or whether they coexist. Studies 3 - 5 explored potential boundary conditions <b>of</b> being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop on pop culture: who people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop from, what people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop on, and when people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop. These studies replicated previous findings of lower need satisfaction when <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop on pop culture while also demonstrating that 1) being unfamiliar with pop culture makes people feel worse rather than being familiar with pop culture making people feel better 2) failure and feeling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop may coexist and 3) individuals feel bad regardless <b>of</b> who they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop from, what they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop on, and when they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop. These findings suggest that being unfamiliar with pop culture may be extremely negative, as no factors seem to ameliorate the negative effects...|$|R
5|$|With Kesler {{back in the}} lineup, the Canucks were inconstant {{posting a}} 2–3–2 record. Kesler {{registered}} five points in the seven games, but was playing with the discomfort steaming from a blocked shot {{in his first game}} back against Dallas. He was given a CT scan for his peace of mind. The results of the scan revealed a fracture in his foot. Though no time table for his return was given, the expectation was that he would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line-up for four-to-six weeks. Late in the month, Kevin Bieksa suffered a groin injury in a game versus the Nashville Predators. He missed the next two games as Vancouver finished the month with back-to-back losses. After being reunited with Burrows, the Sedin twins registered a combined 18 points in the final six games of February, while Kassian tallied only three assists in the 11 games after his demotion.|$|E
5|$|During the 1999 NBA draft, {{believing that}} the Raptors still lacked a strong frontcourt presence, Grunwald traded first-round draft pick Jonathan Bender for power forward Antonio Davis of the Indiana Pacers. Davis quickly entered the Raptors {{starting}} lineup and he would develop into an All-Star in the coming years. Conversely, Bender would only play nine seasons and would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> league by age 29. In the backcourt, Carter, Christie and Dell Curry played at the shooting guard position and Alvin Williams and Muggsy Bogues at point guard. The rotation of Davis, Oakley and Willis in the frontcourt and Carter's and McGrady's improvement helped the team make its first ever playoff appearance, fulfilling a promise Carter had made to fans in the previous season. Lacking significant post-season experience, Toronto was defeated 3–0 by the New York Knicks in the first round. Nonetheless, team improvements {{and the rise of}} Carter—who emphatically won the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest—attracted many fans around Toronto, many of whom were previously not basketball fans. The season was also the first full year played at the Air Canada Centre, after having played four years at the cavernous SkyDome, which was better suited to baseball and Canadian football. Overall, the Raptors concluded the season with a 45–37 record.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{probably}} gave York to Geoffrey in {{the hope}} of forcing him to become a full priest, and thus eliminate a potential rival for the throne. Richard also required Geoffrey to swear that he would remain outside England for three years during the time Richard expected to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country on crusade. The king subsequently released Geoffrey from the oath, the initial swearing of which was apparently another of Richard's efforts to keep Geoffrey's possible ambitions towards the English throne in check. But the cathedral chapter at York disputed Geoffrey's appointment, claiming that because the Dean of York, Hubert Walter, and some others of the chapter had not been present, the election was invalid. Walter's election to York was supported by Richard's mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, whom a chronicler claimed hated Geoffrey as the product of one of her husband's affairs. Richard consequently retained his control over the estates of the archbishopric, and did not confirm the election until a council held at Pipewell on 16September. At that council Richard also appointed three men to offices within the diocese of York: he made Henry Marshal the dean; Burchard du Puiset, a relative of Hugh du Puiset, became treasurer; and Roger of London the abbot of Selby Abbey. Geoffrey objected to these appointments, and as a result his estates were confiscated by the king until he submitted and became a priest. The historians Ralph Turner and Richard Heiser speculate that Richard's strategy in making these appointments was to keep Geoffrey distracted by problems within his diocese, and thus unable to challenge for the English throne. The two historians also suggest that Richard may have been making an example of Geoffrey, in a demonstration that he could be harsh even with his own relatives.|$|E

5|$|The {{motivations of}} the three in the infighting are not {{completely}} clear. According to Friedrich Katz, Madero, in refusing to let Navarro be killed, was motivated not only by his personal humanism but also by a need to assert his civilian authority over military leaders. It also seems that Villa was mostly concerned with {{taking care of his}} soldiers and his personal hatred for Navarro, since it was his soldiers—known as Villistas—who Navarro had earlier ordered to be bayoneted. Years later, after he fell out with Orozco, Villa wrote in his memoirs that the whole episode was a set-up by Orozco, who had been paid 50,000 pesos by Díaz's agents to get him to kill Madero. While Katz and other scholars consider this assessment extreme, it is possible that Orozco, who believed he should be the rightful leader of the revolution, was trying to provoke Villa into killing Madero. That way Madero would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way, Villa would be discredited among the intellectual revolutionary circles as a common bandit and Orozco could claim the mantle of leadership. In the end, however, Villa kept his cool, Madero convinced common soldiers to support him and Orozco did not have the nerve to go through with it.|$|E

Maurice Metzinger, Jean's brother, made several trips to the United States, in 1906, 1910 and would soon move there permanently in pursuit of his career as a Cellist. In light of the turmoil surrounding his non-acceptance at the Armory show, his brother's experiences in New York, his soon to be exposition at the Cubist Exhibition, Boggs & Buhl's, and the representation of a steamship in the upper right quadrant of L'Oiseau bleu, it would not <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question that Metzinger made reference to the American flag (as opposed to a red and white stripped canopy of a Parisian café as suggested by Fry).|$|E

25|$|Farran was court martialled on {{a charge}} of murdering Alexander Rubowitz. Colonel Fergusson, to whom Farran was said to have confessed his guilt, refused to testify, on the grounds that he might {{incriminate}} himself. Notes made by Farran while in custody and found after his escape reportedly contained a confession, but they were judged to be preparation for his defence, and so inadmissible under the rules of lawyer-client privilege. The prosecution failed to prove that the hat was Farran's or even that Rubowitz was actually dead. The result was that the case collapsed for lack of evidence. Rubowitz's family made many unsuccessful attempts to revive the case. Alexander Rubowitz's body has never been found.

It was the cinema that offered him the greatest escape from an unsatisfying home life. He was eight years old when he saw his first movie, Abel Gance's Paradis Perdu (Paradise Lost) from 1939. It was there that his obsession began. He frequently played truant from school and would sneak into theaters because he didn't have enough money for admission. After being expelled from several schools, at the age of fourteen he decided to become self-taught. Two of his academic goals were to watch three movies a day and read three books a week.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, unionists were {{concerned}} about the continued presence of U.S. forces at Fort Sumter despite assurances communicated informally to them by U.S. Secretary of State William Seward that it would be abandoned. Lincoln and Seward were also concerned that the Virginia convention was still in session as of the first of April while secession sentiment was growing. At Lincoln's invitation, unionist John B. Baldwin of Augusta County met with the president on April 4. Baldwin explained that the unionists needed the evacuation of Fort Sumter, a national convention to debate the sectional differences, and a commitment by Lincoln to support constitutional protections for southern rights. Over Lincoln's skepticism, Baldwin argued that Virginia would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union within forty-eight hours if either side fired a shot at the fort.
