5|$|For the {{technical}} crew members, the film's human characters posed a difficult set of challenges. Bird's story {{was filled with}} elements that were difficult to animate with CGI back then. Humans are widely {{considered to be the}} most difficult things to execute in animation. Pixar's animators filmed themselves walking to better grasp proper human motion. Creating an all-human cast required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Although {{the technical}} team had some experience with hair and cloth in Monsters, Inc. (2001), the amount of hair and cloth required for The Incredibles had never been done by Pixar until this point. Moreover, Bird would tolerate no compromises for the sake of technical simplicity. Where the technical team on Monsters, Inc. had persuaded director Pete Docter to accept pigtails on Boo to make her hair easier to animate, the character of Violet had to have long hair that obscured her face; it was integral to her character. Violet's long hair, which was extremely difficult to animate, was only successfully animated toward the end of production. In addition, animators had to adapt to having hair underwater and <b>blowing</b> <b>through</b> the wind. Disney was initially reluctant to make the film because of these issues, feeling a live-action film would be preferable, though Lasseter vetoed this.|$|E
5|$|Already in 1878, voices sounded for Reitz {{to run for}} the presidency, but President Brand's {{position}} was still very strong and Reitz openly praised his qualities and refused to stand against him. In the late 1870s and early 1880s the political temperature ran high in the Orange Free State. The annexation of the South African Republic (Transvaal) by the British in 1877 and the First Anglo-Boer War of 1880–1881 in which that republic regained its autonomy impacted deeply on political sentiments in the Orange Free State. On the one hand there were those who propagated caution in the relationship with the British, on the other there developed a political movement that strongly propagated a (reawakened) Afrikaner national consciousness. Reitz was part of the latter, and together with C.L.F. Borckenhagen, editor of the Bloemfontein Express newspaper, he wrote a constitution for the Afrikaner Bond (Afrikaner Union), a political party originally set up by leading Afrikaner politicians in the Cape Colony, like Rev S.J. du Toit and his Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners ('Society of True Afrikaners') and Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr and the Zuidafrikaansche Boeren Beschermings Vereeniging ('South African Boer Protection Association'). Among the supporters of this new Afrikaner nationalism in the Orange Free State was also Reitz's successor, M.T. Steyn, then still a young lawyer. The constitution was presented in April 1881, and several months later Reitz became the chairman of the Bond. His overt political activities earned Reitz criticism from those who feared a breakdown of relations with the British. It is obvious, however, that a wind of change was <b>blowing</b> <b>through</b> the Boer republics and among the Afrikaners in the Cape Colony, which was to change Anglo-Boer relations drastically.|$|E
25|$|The {{second level}} of the pyramid is {{relaxation}} (looseness). Signs of looseness in the horse may be seen by an even stride that is swinging through the back and causing the tail to swing like a pendulum, looseness at the poll, a soft chewing of the bit, and a relaxed <b>blowing</b> <b>through</b> the nose. The horse makes smooth transitions, is easy to position from side to side, and willingly reaches down into the contact as the reins are lengthened.|$|E

25|$|In 1914, {{a teenage}} boy named Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) from Devon, England, {{witnesses}} {{the birth of a}} bay Thoroughbred foal and subsequently watches with admiration the growth of the young horse. Much to the dismay of his mother Rose (Emily Watson), his father Ted buys the colt at auction, outbidding their landlord Lyons, despite their needing a more suitable plough horse for the farm work. Albert's best friend, Andrew Easton, watches as Albert teaches his colt many things, such as to come when he imitates the call of an owl by <b>blowing</b> <b>through</b> his cupped hands.

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} glassblowing {{was found by}} Roman Ghirshman in Chogha Zanbil, where many glass bottles {{were found in the}} excavations of the 2nd millennium BC site. Later evidence comes from a collection of waste from a glass shop, including fragments of glass tubes, glass rods and tiny blown bottles, which was dumped in a mikvah, a ritual bath in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, dated from 37 to 4 BC. Some of the glass tubes recovered are fire-closed at one end and are partially inflated by <b>blowing</b> <b>through</b> the open end while still hot to form a small bottle; thus they are considered as a rudimentary form of blowpipe.|$|E
25|$|Elliot, Alma, and Jess hitch a {{ride with}} a nurseryman and his wife. The nurseryman {{believes}} that plants are responsible, as they can release chemicals to defend themselves from threats. The group are joined by other survivors and split into two groups, with Elliot, Alma, and Jess in the smaller group. When the larger group {{is affected by the}} toxin, Elliot realizes that the plants are targeting only large groups of people. He splits their group into smaller pockets and they walk along, arriving at a model home. Two other groups arrive on the property, triggering a neurotoxin attack, signaled by what appears to be wind <b>blowing</b> <b>through</b> the vegetation. The next house they come upon is sealed, its residents trying to protect themselves from the toxin. Elliot's attempts to reason with them are deemed unsuccessful when the residents shoot Josh and Jared, two teenage boys whom Elliot had earlier befriended.|$|E

25|$|Central Alberta has a dry {{continental}} climate, {{with most}} places falling under the humid continental classification (Köppen climate classification Dfb), though some {{areas in the}} southeast of this region, close to the border with Saskatchewan around Oyen, are semi-arid (Köppen BSk). Precipitation levels here are generally higher than in Southern Alberta, though the driest areas of Alberta, around Empress, are in Central Alberta. This region generally has cooler temperatures than Southern Alberta in both summer and winter, due to the decreased amount of solar radiation received, and the lower frequency of chinooks <b>blowing</b> <b>through</b> the region. After Southern Ontario, Central Alberta is the region in Canada most likely to experience tornadoes. Most of Central Alberta is covered by aspen parkland, but the driest areas have mixedgrass and even dry mixedgrass prairie, while the wetter and/or cooler areas are covered in mixed boreal forest. The wetter parts of this region, around Edmonton, {{have some of the}} most fertile land in the Canadian Prairies.|$|E
25|$|The Giants {{shut out}} the Redskins, {{allowing}} only 150 passing yards and 40 rushing yards. New York won the coin toss but elected to kick off with the 32 mile-per-hour winds <b>blowing</b> <b>through</b> Giants Stadium (the Redskins would never kick off, as they chose to receive the second-half kickoff). After the Redskins were forced to punt on their opening possession, punter Steve Cox could only manage to kick {{the ball in the}} strong wind 23 yards to the Washington 47-yard line. Six plays and 17 yards later, the Giants scored on Raul Allegre's 47-yard field goal, his longest of the season after joining the team in week 4. After the ensuing kickoff, the Redskins were forced to punt again and Cox managed to only punt the ball 27 yards to the Washington 38-yard line. From there, New York advanced to the Redskins 26. On third down and 10, quarterback Phil Simms threw an incomplete pass and center Bart Oates was called for holding. Rather than take the incompletion to bring up fourth down, Redskins coach Joe Gibbs accepted the holding penalty, hoping to push and keep the Giants out of field goal range. But on the next play, Simms completed a 25-yard pass to Lionel Manuel for a first down. A few plays later, Simms finished the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Manuel on third down and goal.|$|E

500|$|Elephants produce several sounds, usually {{through the}} larynx, though {{some may be}} {{modified}} by the trunk. Perhaps the most well known call is the trumpet which is made by <b>blowing</b> <b>through</b> the trunk. Trumpeting is made during excitement, distress or aggression. Fighting elephants may roar or squeal, and wounded ones may bellow. Rumbles are produced during mild arousal and some appear to be infrasonic. Infrasonic calls are important, particularly for long-distance communication, in both Asian and African elephants. For Asian elephants, these calls have a frequency of 14–24Hz, with sound pressure levels of 85–90dB and last 10–15 seconds.

500|$|Aaliyah {{sang with}} {{restrained}} soprano vocals throughout the album. Vibe magazine's Hyun Kim argued that its songs drew focus to her singing {{more than her}} previous records, [...] "bringing it to the forefront as opposed to hiding it behind the layered production". [...] "Rock the Boat" [...] was sung with breathless vocals by Aaliyah, who instructed her lover on how to please her sexually and equated her erotic high to a drug high. Ballads such as [...] "I Care 4 U", [...] "Never No More", and [...] "I Refuse" [...] were sung more emotively, expressing melancholy qualities and hurt. On [...] "I Can Be", Aaliyah sang {{from the perspective of}} an adulterous man's mistress who wanted to be his foremost girlfriend. Alex Macpherson from The Guardian wrote that [...] "Aaliyah's blank, numbed delivery" [...] on the song [...] "makes being the other woman seem like an emotionally masochistic form of self-medication". Biographer Christopher John Farley said she [...] "emotionally detailed a song" [...] unlike on her previous albums and that [...] "her gentle voice now seemed like something elemental, a kindly wind <b>blowing</b> <b>through</b> the branches of a big tree." [...] According to Joshua Clover, Aaliyah pushed musical notes [...] "into strange corners of syncopation's shifty architecture" [...] on the more [...] "shape-defying" [...] tracks.

Perpetua concluded the review by jokingly adding that the song will become [...] "n anthem for salons everywhere." [...] Jody Rosen from the same publication felt that [...] "although Gaga is not the first singer to create a connection between self-esteem and liberation to free-flowing coiffure, she seems to be the most committed to the idea." [...] Dan Martin from NME classified [...] "Hair" [...] as an empowerment anthem, using the [...] "simple image of the wind <b>blowing</b> <b>through</b> a person’s hair to illuminate the album’s Love-Yourself-And-Let-It-All-Hang-Out message way more effectively than the title track. It trumps it once again by being quite the gayest thing you will ever hear for a long time." [...] Tim Jonze from The Guardian felt that the message of [...] "Hair" [...] was not particularly a new one, since the 60's musical Hair also preached the same message. Although he described some of the lyrics as [...] "trite", Jonze opined that [...] "these weaknesses can also be strengths, and there's something admirable about the way the [...] address confused teenagers in search of their identity." [...] Writing for The Vancouver Sun, Leah Collins described the song as [...] "a pumping anthem designed to pump up your follicles with pride."
