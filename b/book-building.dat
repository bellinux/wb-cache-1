50|$|As {{a result}} of market flex, loan {{syndication}} functions as a <b>book-building</b> exercise, in bond-market parlance. A loan is originally launched to market at a target spread or, as was increasingly common by 2008 {{with a range of}} spreads referred to as price talk (i.e., a target spread of, say, LIBOR+250 to LIBOR+275). Investors then will make commitments that in many cases are tiered by the spread. For example, an account may put in for $25 million at LIBOR+275 or $15 million at LIBOR+250. At the end of the process, the arranger will total up the commitments and then make a call on where to price the paper. Following the example above, if the paper is vastly oversubscribed at LIBOR+250, the arranger may slice the spread further. Conversely, if it is undersubscribed even at LIBOR+275, then the arranger will be forced to raise the spread to bring more money to the table.|$|E

40|$|In 1998, the Philippines {{introduced}} <b>book-building</b> pricing {{mechanisms for}} Initial Public Offerings. Almost all capital raised through IPOs in the Philippines is done using a <b>book-building</b> pricing method, however {{a significant number}} of IPOs still occur using non-book-building methods. Understanding why <b>book-building</b> has become the dominant pricing mechanism but yet non-book-building methods still survive is the aim of this paper. I find that unlike other countries where the introduction of <b>book-building</b> leads to higher total issue costs for individual issuers and unlike theory which suggests the increased effort of <b>book-building</b> should come with increased costs, IPOs that use book-built pricing in the Philippines actually have a lower total issue cost {{as a percentage of the}} total issue size compared to issuers who use non-book-building methods. This being the case, explaining why non-book-built IPOs still occur is even more interesting. I find that the large variance in size and the low volume of IPOs in the Philippines creates a bifurcated market where it is uneconomical for underwriters to use <b>book-building</b> to service small firms who want to IPO. The harder phenomenon to explain is the choice by firms who are large enough to book-build to use non-book-built methods. I suggest that the developing sophistication of the local market as well as the relationship driven aspect of business in the Philippines are two possible explanations...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we have {{analysed}} 166 <b>book-building</b> and fixed-price IPOs {{listed on}} the Oslo Stock Exchange in 1993 - 2008 and compared the efficiency of two pricing mechanisms used in them (in terms of level and variability of underpricing, {{and the ability to}} fully incorporate market conditions in the pre-offering period into the final offer price). After having controlled for firm, issue characteristics and market conditions in the period prior to an IPO, we have found that the <b>book-building</b> mechanism is associated with 5. 2 % significantly lower underpricing. It has also been found that <b>book-building</b> is less sensitive to market conditions prior to an IPO. Yet, both pricing mechanisms have the similar variability of underpricing, i. e. accuracy of pricing. All things considered, we conclude that <b>book-building</b> (vs. fixed-price) is a more efficient pricing mechanism in the Norwegian IPO market, as it underprices less, and more effectively incorporates market conditions in the pre-offering period into the final offer price.

40|$|The <b>book-building</b> {{procedure}} for selling {{initial public offerings}} to investors has captured significant market share from auction alternatives in recent years, despite significantly lower costs in both direct fees and initial underpricing when using the auction mechanism. This Paper shows that in the French market, where the frequency of <b>book-building</b> and auctions was about equal in the 1990 s, the ostensible advantages to the issuer using <b>book-building</b> were advertising-related quid pro quo benefits. Specifically, we find that book-built issues {{were more likely to}} be followed and positively recommended by the lead underwriters and were also more likely to receive ‘booster shots’ post-issuance if the shares had fallen. Even non-underwriters’ analysts appear to promote book-built issues more, but only when their underwriters stood to gain from acquiring shares in future issues from the recommended firm’s lead underwriter. Book-built issues also appeared to garner more press in general (but only after they had chosen <b>book-building,</b> not before). Yet, we do not observe valuation or return differentials to suggest these types of promotion have any value to the issuing firm. We conclude that underwriters using the <b>book-building</b> procedure have convinced issuers of the questionable value of advertising and promotion of their shares. auctions; book building; IPOs...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, the {{phenomenon}} of under-pricing in initial public offerings ("IPOs") has been widely studied. Many theories have been proposed {{in an attempt to}} solve the well-known mystery of IPO under-pricing. In this paper, I will conduct a brief survey on some profound IPO studies. Some major research areas and findings will be discussed. In particular, I will study the impact of the US <b>book-building</b> method on the IPO's short-term performance. Up to now, there has been relatively little research attempting to relate the US styled <b>book-building</b> method and the pronounced under-pricing of new issues. Built on the traditional theories of information asymmetry, I do expect that the degree of IPO under-pricing should be reduced when the <b>book-building</b> method is adopted to "arrow" the information gap between the investors, issuers, and the underwriter. According the theories of information asymmetry, information gap between the issuer and the underwriter lead to share under-pricing so as to compensate the underwriter for bearing the additional perceived risk. Lesser degree of under-pricing is expected on the <b>book-building</b> method where more market information, e. g. market demand, about the shares is revealed to the concerned parties. Underwriters will have a better idea on the prospective market demand on the issues through meeting with the institutional investors, conducting roadshows as well as other advertising programs. Considering the <b>book-building</b> method is an effective means of conveying valuable signal to the investor, I proposed that the <b>book-building</b> method might reduce the degree of under-pricing of new issues in two perspectives. First, it reduces the perceived uncertainty on the true value of the new issue. Assuming investors are risk-averse, the required rate of return decreased and degree of under-pricing reduced. Second, the <b>book-building</b> method does not only reduce the perceived uncertainty of the new issue, but also acted as an effective means to reveal the true type of the firm to the investor. It is because only good firms are willing to "burn the money" (the <b>book-building</b> method is costly) and the bad type firm will find it too costly to mimic the good firm as there is always a chance that their true type is revealed to the public during the process. Therefore, firms going <b>book-building</b> can be interpreted as a good signal to the investors. In this paper, I will, in particular, study the effect of the <b>book-building</b> method on the degree of IPO under-pricing with the use of IPO data in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong IPO data was used because its unique regulatory feature regarding the methods of issuing new shares. The primary market of Hong Kong is special in a sense that it allows both the US styled <b>book-building</b> method and the UK styled fixed price offer to be used. In this study, 246 Hong Kong IPO data from 1993 to 1997 were selected and reviewed. Unlike most of the previous studies where the initial returns of IPOs are adjusted by the market return over a one-day period, the initial returns of all IPOs are adjusted by the market return over the period from the first day of subscription to the first day of trading. It is believe that this new definition of market adjusted initial return better reflects the degree of under-pricing as the issue price of a new issue is usually determined shortly before the first day of subscription period. The empirical results suggest that the adoption of the <b>book-building</b> method does play a role in affecting the degree of under-pricing in new issues.

The positive relation is partly explained by the practice of giving institutions more shares in IPOs with strong pre-market demand, as predicted by <b>book-building</b> theories. However, our tests suggest that institutional allocation also contains private information about first-day IPO returns not reflected in pre- market demand and other public information.

This dissertation investigates the determinants of IPO underpricing on Chinese A-share market using a sample of 1376 IPOs listed {{during the period from}} 2001 to 2015. The study examines the applicability of traditional western theory on the Chinese IPO underpricing and also considers the specific characteristics of Chinese stock market when analysing the possible reasons for underpricing in China. The empirical results suggest that underwriter reputation theory, winner’s curse theory and ex-ante uncertainty theory are not applicable in China’s IPO market based on sample data. The principal-agent theory, time interval theory and signalling theory can explain Chinese IPO underpricing, although the test result of signalling theory is contrary to the expectation. Meanwhile, speculative bubble theory and information cascades theory have high explanatory power. More importantly, the study finds that application of equity separation reform and implementation of IPO reform in 2009 diminish the magnitude of underpricing. It can be concluded that the development of Chinese stock market indeed contributes to a gradually decline on underpricing level.

40|$|While {{there is}} {{extensive}} literature documenting {{the discrepancy between}} IPO offer prices and their respective closing prices on the first day, few had {{examined the relationship between}} the offer, first-trade, and the first-day closing prices of IPOs. We examine the IPO trading return on the first day (opening price-to-closing price) to determine whether investment banks are efficient in setting the first-trade prices. We also examine when final offer price is set relative to when trading starts as a proxy for level of oversubscription. We find that open-to-close return is positive and significant. It is negatively related to the offer-to-open return, even after controlling for issue characteristics and market conditions. This is particularly prominent during the bubble period when laddering agreements were arguably widespread. These findings suggest the possibility of substitution between lower offer-to-open return for higher open-to-close return in the secondary market. We also find that high ranked underwriters are more conservative in setting of the first-trade price relative to the closing price in first-day trading. They tend to leave more return to the secondary market investors even after controlling for our measures of difficulty in setting the offer price.

The quality of internal innovation declines by 50 percent relative to 8 ̆ 5 rms that remained private, measured by standard patent-based metrics. The decline in innovation is driven by both an exodus of skilled inventors and a decline in productivity among remaining inventors. However, access to public equity markets allows 8 ̆ 5 rms to partially o¤set the decline in internally generated innovation by attracting new human capital and purchasing externally generated innovations through mergers and acquisitions. Managerial incentives seem {{to play an important role}} in explaining the results. 1...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{for a book}} on the {{regulation}} of primary securities markets investigates the persistence of the fixed price offering in the United States. Fixed price offerings present a puzzle because economic theory suggests that sellers would maximize returns by offering IPO shares for sale at different prices depending upon characteristics of the buyer or the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s order. Contrary to this expectation, however, American companies uniformly sell IPO shares at a single fixed offering price. Moreover, this is true regardless of whether the shares are sold through the traditional <b>book-building</b> process or at auction. This phenomenon is not a function of the legal or regulatory structure governing public offerings in the United States, which neither mandates fixed price offerings nor bars price discrimination in IPOs. Instead, {{it appears to be a}} result of the market power of underwriters. A close examination of the offering process reveals a form of implicit price discrimination in which underwriters clearly engage - that is, the selective allocation of shares with resale restrictions. The chapter argues that underwriters favor implicit price discrimination over explicit price discrimination because the benefits of implicit price discrimination redound to the underwriter while explicit price discrimination would benefit issuers and eliminate an important (but hidden) component of underwriter compensation...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} role of banking {{relationships}} in IPO underwriting using a sample of 484 Japanese IPOs. Among other issues, we consider whether bank relationships lead to increased access to public equity markets, especially for smaller, lesser-known firms. When a firm in Japan goes public, it can engage an investment bank that is related through a common main bank, or can select an alternative investment bank. The main bank relationship can be an efficient way for the investment bank to acquire information generated by the main bank, but may give rise to conflicts of interest. We use data from two different investment banking regimes in Japan (a hybrid auction-method regime and a <b>book-building</b> regime) and find that main bank relationships give small issuers increased access to equity capital markets, but that issuers of large IPOs switch to non-related investment banks {{that are capable of}} managing large offerings. While we find evidence that investment banks seek to exploit bargaining power with related issuers, we also find that issuers respond to expected high issue cost by switching to non-related investment banks. The net result is that total issue costs through related and non-related investment banks are similar. With respect to aftermarket performance and use of offer proceeds, we find no evidence of conflict of interest or self-dealing for either the main bank or the investment bank.
