5|$|Conventional {{prenatal}} {{tests for}} chromosomal abnormalities such as Down Syndrome rely on analysing {{the number and}} appearance of the chromosomesthe karyotype. Molecular diagnostics tests such as microarray comparative genomic hybridisation test a sample of DNA instead, and because of cell-free DNA in plasma, could be less invasive, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>of</b> 2013 it is still an adjunct to the conventional tests.|$|E

5|$|Malawi’s first {{science and}} {{technology}} policy dates from 1991 and was revised in 2002. The National Science and Technology Policy of 2002 envisaged {{the establishment of a}} National Commission for Science and Technology to advise the government and other stakeholders on {{science and technology}}-led development. Although the Science and Technology Act of 2003 made provision for the creation of this commission, it only became operational in 2011, with a secretariat resulting from the merger of the Department of Science and Technology and the National Research Council. The Science and Technology Act of 2003 also established a Science and Technology Fund to finance research and studies through government grants and loans <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>of</b> 2014, this was not yet operational. The Secretariat of the National Commission for Science and Technology has reviewed the Strategic Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation (2011–2015) <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>of</b> early 2015, the revised policy had not yet met with Cabinet approval.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{diamonds}} {{found on}} Earth originated on Earth. Primitive interstellar meteorites {{were found to}} contain carbon possibly {{in the form of}} diamond.

5|$|About 1 in 1000 adults {{per year}} has DVT, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>of</b> 2011, {{available}} data {{are dominated by}} North American and European populations. VTE is rare in children, with an incidence of about 1 in 100,000 a year. From childhood to old age, incidence increases {{by a factor of}} about 1000, with almost 1% of the elderly experiencing VTE yearly. During pregnancy and after childbirth, acute VTE occurs about once per 1000 deliveries. After surgery with preventative treatment, VTE develops in about 10 of 1000 people after total or partial knee replacement, and in about 5 of 1000 after total or partial hip replacement. About 300,000–600,000 Americans develop VTE each year, with about 60,000–100,000 deaths attributable to PE. In England, an estimated 25,000 a year die from hospital-related VTE. For unclear reasons, people of Asian descent have a lower VTE risk than whites.|$|E
5|$|An {{announcement}} was made that Brosnan and director Martin Campbell will team up once again for a film adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway novel, Across the River and into the Trees, in which Brosnan will {{play the role of}} the protagonist, Colonel Cantwell.

Brosnan later joined Jamie Dornan and Cillian Murphy in a film based on the events of The Maze Prison Escape, titled H-Block which is to be directed by Jim Sheridan.|$|E
5|$|Catholicism {{was first}} {{propagated}} in Nepal during the 18th century, though from 1810 to 1950 no missionaries were allowed in Nepal. Since 1951, missionaries have again been allowed, though proselytism has remained illegal, and conversion to Christianity remained illegal until 1990. In 1983 a mission sui iuris covering Nepal was created, and in 1996 it {{was raised to}} an Apostolic Prefecture. The 1990 Nepali constitution did not guarantee religious freedom for Christians, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>of</b> May 2006 Nepal has been declared a secular state. The interim constitution, finalized in 2007, guarantees some religious freedom but prohibits people from trying to convert others. On February 10, 2007, Benedict XVI elevated the prefecture of Nepal {{to the rank of}} a vicariate and appointed Anthony Francis Sharma as the first vicar and first Nepalese bishop of the Catholic Church.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{agreement}} and subsequent ceasefire, relations between Kagame and the Congolese government have remained tense. A 2003 United Nations report alleged that Rwanda was using demobilised soldiers {{to continue its}} illegal exploitation of Congolese minerals. Meanwhile, Kagame blamed Kabila for failing to suppress Hutu rebels in North and South Kivu provinces. Two major insurgencies {{have occurred in the}} eastern provinces: the first, from 2005 to 2009, was led by Congolese Tutsi Laurent Nkunda, while the second, carried out by the March 23 Movement (M23) under leader Bosco Ntaganda, began in 2012; Ntaganda gave himself up to the International Criminal Court in early 2013, and peace talks have taken place, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>of</b> May 2013 the conflict is at risk of resuming. Human Rights Watch alleges that both insurgencies were supported by Rwanda, a charge Kagame denies. A leaked United Nations report in 2012 also alleges Rwandan support for M23; this report cites Kagame's defence minister James Kabarebe as being effectively the commander of the movement.|$|E
5|$|Early {{photovoltaic}} systems output decreased {{as much as}} 10%/year, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>of</b> 2010 the median degradation rate was 0.5%/year, with modules made after 2000 having a significantly lower degradation rate, so that a system would lose only 12% of its output performance in 25 years. A system using modules which degrade 4%/year will lose 64% of its output during the same period. Many panel makers offer a performance guarantee, typically 90% in ten years and 80% over 25 years. The output of all panels is typically warranteed at plus or minus 3% {{during the first year}} of operation.|$|E

The two tracks on the lower level of that tunnel are being connected to the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) via the East Side Access project. The project will bring trains from the LIRR's Main Line to Grand Central Terminal, <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>of</b> December 2016, the lower level is currently unused.|$|E
