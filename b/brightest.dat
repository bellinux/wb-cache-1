40|$|We studied early NK-cell {{recovery}} in 29 allografted patients undergoing different lymphoreductive regimens. Already at 2 ?wk after graft take, {{the number of}} NK cells had reached (supra) normal levels but NK-cell subsets were skewed. The number of CD 56 (dim) CD 16 (<b>bright)</b> NK cells was low and correlated strongly {{with the level of}} hematopoiesis, whereas the number of the more abundant NK cells expressing high levels of CD 56 did not. Post-transplant CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> NK cells (ptCD 56 (<b>bright))</b> differed from CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> NK cells in normal controls (CD 56 (<b>bright))</b> in being HLA-DR- and perforin-positive, CCR 7 (-), CD 27 (-), CD 127 (-) and mostly c-kit(-). CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> from normal controls stimulated by IL- 15 in vitro (NK(IL- 15)) acquired all the characteristics distinguishing CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> from ptCD 56 (<b>bright).</b> IL- 2 exerted similar effects. Moreover, when cultured without cytokines, ptCD 56 (<b>bright),</b> CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> and NK(IL- 15) responded similarly by upregulating CD 127 and c-kit but not CCR 7. IL- 12 stimulated IFN-? production in ptCD 56 (<b>bright),</b> whereas CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> responded only to IL- 12 plus IL- 15. Hence, ptCD 56 (<b>bright)</b> have all the features of cytokine-stimulated CD 56 (<b>bright).</b> Because only patients with low numbers of T cells had high numbers of ptCD 56 (<b>bright),</b> we conclude that ptCD 56 (<b>bright)</b> are activated CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> that expand while competing with T cells for the elevated post-transplant level of IL- 15...|$|R

5|$|Canis Major is a {{prominent}} constellation {{because of its}} many bright stars.

Another, NR Canis Majoris, will be <b>brightest</b> at magnitude −0.88 in about 2.87 million years' time.|$|E
5|$|Circinus is a faint constellation, {{with only}} one star {{brighter}} than fourth magnitude. Alpha Circini, a white main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 3.19, is 54light-years away and 4° south of Alpha Centauri. Not only the <b>brightest</b> star in the constellation, {{it is also the}} <b>brightest</b> example of a rapidly oscillating Ap (RoAp) star in the night sky. It has the unusual spectral type A7Vp SrCrE, showing increased emissions of strontium, chromium and europium. Stars of this type have oddly localised magnetic fields and are slightly variable. Alpha Circini forms a binary star system with an orange dwarf companion of spectral type K5 and magnitude 8.5, which with a separation of 5.7arcseconds is only discernible with a telescope. The distance between the two stars is 260AU and they take 2600years to rotate around a common centre of gravity. The second <b>brightest</b> star is Beta Circini, a white main sequence star of spectral type A3Va and a magnitude of 4.07, about 100light-years away. It has around 1.8times the diameter of the Sun.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bright</b> (B-cell {{regulator}} of immunoglobulin {{heavy chain}} transcription) binding to immunoglobulin heavy chain loci after B-cell activation {{is associated with}} increased heavy chain transcription. Our earlier reports demonstrated that <b>Bright</b> coimmunoprecipitates with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) and that these proteins associate in a DNA-binding complex in primary B cells. B cells from immunodeficient mice with a mutation in Btk failed to produce stable <b>Bright</b> DNA-binding complexes. In order to determine if Btk is important for <b>Bright</b> function, a transcription activation assay was established and analyzed using real-time PCR technology. Cells lacking both <b>Bright</b> and Btk were transfected with <b>Bright</b> and/or Btk along with an immunoglobulin heavy chain reporter construct. Immunoglobulin gene transcription was enhanced when <b>Bright</b> and Btk were coexpressed. In contrast, neither <b>Bright</b> nor Btk alone led to activation of heavy chain transcription. Furthermore, <b>Bright</b> function required both Btk kinase activity and sequences within the pleckstrin homology domain of Btk. <b>Bright</b> was not appreciably phosphorylated by Btk; however, a third tyrosine-phosphorylated protein coprecipitated with <b>Bright.</b> Thus, the ability of <b>Bright</b> to enhance immunoglobulin transcription critically requires functional Btk...|$|R
