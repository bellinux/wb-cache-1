5000|$|Most of {{the movie}} has an {{implication}} of a religious background, and is applying technology to accomplish the goals with what {{is considered to be}} [...] "god like" [...] powers, through interdependent connection. Kurzweil has been criticized as being a modern-day prophet, however the film describes a detailed list of his inventions. Ray's dedication to improving the blind's quality of life is displayed in the climax of the film, with his miniature <b>blind</b> <b>reading</b> tool. Ray speaks of emailing someone a blouse, or printing out a toaster utilizing nanotechnology. Eventually swarms of our nanotechnology will be sent by us into the universe to, as Kurzweil puts it, [...] "wake up the universe". [...] Against this optimistic backdrop of human and machine evolution, concerns about Kurzweil's predictions are raised by technology experts, philosophers, and commentators. Physician William B. Hurlbut warns of tragedy and views Kurzweil's claims as lacking a more moderate approach necessitated by biological science. AI engineer Ben Goertzel champions the transhumanist vision, but acknowledges the possibility of a dystopian outcome. AI researcher Hugo de Garis warns of a coming [...] "Artilect War", where god-like artificial intellects and those who want to build them, will fight against those who don't. Kevin Warwick, professor of Cybernetics at University of Reading, advocates the benefits of the singularity, but suggests the Terminator scenario could also occur, where humans become subservient to machine and live on a farm, and the singularity is the point where humans lose control to the intelligent machines. Warwick basically spells doom for anyone who is human after the singularity. Dean Kamen observes that advances in technology have finally made immortality a reasonable goal. At the end of the film, Kurzweil states, [...] "if I was asked if god exists, I would say not yet." ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} whether visual assessment of [I- 123]-FP-CIT (DaTSCAN(TM), Nycomed Amersham, pie) single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) images can differentiate between parkinsonism and essential tremor (ET). METHODS: [I- 123]-FP-CIT SPECT imaging {{was conducted in}} a six-center study of 158 patients with a clinical diagnosis of parkinsonism compared with 27 ET cases and 35 healthy volunteers. Striatal uptake of the radioligand was graded normal or abnormal, and abnormal images were further graded to three levels of severity. An institutional read whereby each center visually assessed the images blinded to the clinical data and a consensus <b>blinded</b> <b>read</b> {{by a panel of}} five was undertaken. RESULTS: The institutional reading scored 154 of 158 cases of parkinsonism abnormal, all 27 cases of ET as normal, and 34 of 35 healthy volunteers as normal compared with the consensus <b>blinded</b> <b>read</b> scoring 150 cases of parkinsonism as abnormal, 25 ET cases as normal, and 33 healthy volunteers as normal. Sensitivity for the clinical diagnosis of parkinsonism was 97 % and specificity for ET was 100 % for the institutional read, whereas sensitivity was 95 % and specificity 93 % for the consensus <b>blinded</b> <b>read.</b> Semiquantitative analysis of specific: nonspecific caudate and putamen uptake were consistent with the results of visual inspection. CONCLUSION: Visual assessment of [I- 123]-FP-CIT SPECT images is an easily applied diagnostic test which is helpful in the differential diagnosis of tremor disorders and in confirming a clinical diagnosis of a hypokinetic-rigid syndrome...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the trial}} was to {{determine}} the diagnostic accuracy of scintimmammography with technetium- 99 m methoxyisoburylisonitrile (99 mTc-MIBI) in the detection of primary breast cancer and to verify its clinical usefulness. A total of 246 patients with a suspicious breast mass or positive mammogram were included in this prospective European multicentre trial. At 5 min and 60 min (optional) p. i. two lateral prone images were acquired for 10 min each; 30 min p. i. one anterior image was acquired for 10 min. There were 253 lesions (195 palpable and 58 non-palpable), in respect of which histology revealed 165 cancers and 88 benign lesions. Institutional and <b>blinded</b> <b>read</b> results were correlated to core laboratory histopathology results obtained during excisional biopsy. Diagnostic accuracy for the detection of breast cancer was calculated per lesion. The overall sensitivity and specificity of <b>blinded</b> <b>read</b> scintimammography were 71 % and 69 %, respectively. For palpable lesions, the sensitivity of <b>blinded</b> <b>read</b> and institutional read scintimammography was 83 % and 91 %, respectively. Sensitivity was not dependent on the density of the breast tissue. Invasive ductal and invasive lobular cancers showed similar sensitivity. The sensitivity and specificity of mammography were 91 % and 42 % respectively, and did not depend on the tumour size. In 60 % of false-negative mammograms, 99 mTc-MIBI was able to diagnose malignancy (true-positive). High-quality imaging with 99 mTc-MIBI has a high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of primary breast cancer. Used as a complementary method, scintimammography with 99 mTc-MIBI can help to diagnose breast cancer at an earlier stage in patients with dense breasts.

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the private}} message service {{described}} in [4] we show efficiency improvements of that private message service in the computational setting. Regarding an attacker which may control {{all but one of}} the queried servers we describe a private message service with a total communication complexity of <b>blinded</b> <b>read</b> between client and private message service of n bit upstream and k bit downstream, where n denotes the number of cells in the database and k the size of one cell. Apart from a registration mechanism, the communication complexity between client and service is independent of the number of queried servers. Our improvement of the private message service is not only extremely efficient in terms of communication, but also in terms of computation. Further we describe how to use the message service in case of messages which are addressed using visible implicit addresses. After that we prove that at least parts of messages which are addressed using invisible implicit addresses must be broadcasted. We generalize the message service to operations in ZZN (N ≥ 2) and prove the security of <b>blinded</b> <b>read.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This paper follows on from {{previous}} research (Orsini-Jones et. al. 2005) and {{reports on the}} experience of three students, two visually impaired and one <b>blind,</b> <b>reading</b> languages at Coventry University, on the adjustments made to meet their needs and on the challenges encountered on their learning journey both {{from their point of view}} and from the point of view of the staff involved.

It will conclude by evaluating these students’ language learning journey at Coventry University, report on their feedback on their experience and on whether or not they feel that staff have successfully catered for their individual needs. It is argued here, as in the previous related work (Orsini-Jones, et. al. 2005 : 146) that ‘there still exists some tension between the reasonable anticipatory adjustments that lecturers can put in place and the necessary ad hoc ones that will be needed for a disabled student with very specific needs’...|$|E
40|$|The Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) is a ventral-temporal-visual {{area that}} {{develops}} expertise for visual reading. It encodes letter-strings irrespective of case, font, or {{location in the}} visual-field, with striking anatomical reproducibility across individuals. In the <b>blind,</b> <b>reading</b> can be achieved using Braille, with a comparable level-of-expertise to that of sighted readers. We investigated which area {{plays the role of}} the VWFA in the blind. One would expect it to be at either parietal or bilateral occipital cortex, reflecting the tactile nature of the task and crossmodal plasticity, respectively. However, according to the notion that brain areas are task specific rather than sensory-modality specific, we predicted recruitment of the left-hemispheric VWFA, identically to the sighted and independent of visual experience. Using fMRI we showed that activation during Braille reading in congenitally blind individuals peaked in the VWFA, with striking anatomical consistency within and between blind and sighted. The VWFA was reading-selective when contrasted to high-level language and low-level sensory controls. Further preliminary results show that the VWFA is selectively activated also when people learn to read in a new language or using a different modality. Thus, the VWFA is a mutlisensory area specialized for reading regardless of visual experience...|$|E
40|$|The murine {{monoclonal}} antibody MA- 15 C 5 binds to cross-linked fibrin {{but not to}} fibrinogen. Fab or F(ab') 2 fragments of MA- 15 C 5, labeled with iodine- 123, were injected intravenously into nine rabbits with a nonocclusive 0. 2 -mL human plasma clot in the jugular vein and into eight control rabbits. Scintigrams obtained at hourly intervals after injection of the F(ab') 2 fragment revealed a significantly higher accumulation of tracer in the clot region than in the contralateral region. The relative excess of tracer in the jugular vein region was significantly greater in the study animals than in the control animals throughout the study period. <b>Blind</b> <b>reading</b> of serial scans revealed no visible tracer accumulation in seven of eight control rabbits, whereas the scans of seven of nine study rabbits showed clearly visible accumulation (sensitivity = 77 %, specificity = 87 %).

DESIGN: Routine hot Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) 1 % basic fuchsin staining for 15 min in 75 field clinics. <b>Blind</b> <b>reading</b> of duplicate smears stained by ZN 1 % vs. 0. 3 % basic fuchsin applied for 5 min, or by ZN 1 % 5 min vs. Kinyoun cold staining. Rechecking of discordant series. RESULTS: For comparable numbers of false positives, sensitivity was significantly lower with Kinyoun than with ZN 1 % 5 min (85. 6 % vs. 93. 0 %, P < 0. 001). Sensitivity with ZN 1 % 5 min was not significantly higher than with 0. 3 % 5 min staining (89. 9 % vs. 86. 5 %). Routine examination using 1 % 15 min ZN identified more positives {{than any of the}} study techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Kinyoun cold staining sensitivity was unsatisfactory in field clinics. The sensitivity of the WHO/IUATLD recommended 0. 3 % fuchsin for 5 min was not significantly different from the original 1 % ZN for 5 min, but 1 % 15 min hot staining might be superior. A reduced fuchsin concentration together with a short staining time may leave too narrow a margin for error.

40|$|Objective: To {{elucidate}} the multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT) findings of extrapancreatic nerve plexus (PLX) invasion by pancreas head carcinoma (PhC) by "point-by-point" correlation with en bloc pathological specimens {{and to assess}} their diagnostic accuracy. Methods: Each pathological section of PhC and adjusted double oblique multiplanar reconstruction MDCT images were correlated in 554 sections from 37 patients. The diagnostic accuracy of the MDCT patterns derived was assessed by <b>blind</b> <b>reading.</b> Results: PLX invasion with fibrosis showed mass or strand shape (85. 6 %) or coarse reticula (13. 3 %). The CT findings were divided into fine reticular and linear, coarse reticular, mass and strand, and nodular patterns. PLX invasion was revealed pathologically in 92 % of the regions of investigation showing the mass and strand pattern and 63 % of the coarse reticular pattern (all continuous with PhC), and they were highly suggestive of PLX invasion by PhC on MDCT images (p < 0. 001). Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values of these MDCT findings in the diagnosis of PLX invasion were 100 % (25 / 25), 83. 3 % (10 / 12), 94. 6 % (35 / 37), 92. 6 % (25 / 27) and 100 % (10 / 10), respectively.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} {{sensitivity}} and specificity of 1. 5 -T and 3. 0 -T diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) to detect hyperacute ischemic stroke lesions. METHODS: We blindly reviewed the DWI of 135 acute stroke patients and 34 controls performed at 1. 5 T (n = 108) or 3. 0 T (n = 61). The stroke patients all had subsequently proved carotid territory ischemic stroke and were imaged within the first 6 hours after stroke onset. Four readers (2 neuroradiologists and 2 stroke neurologists) blinded to clinical data and magnetic field strength recorded the presence of ischemic lesions on DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps if necessary. Sensitivity, specificity, and false-negative rates were computed. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and DWI contrasts were calculated at both field strengths. RESULTS: The accuracy of DWI in stroke diagnosis was superior at 1. 5 T (98. 8 %) than at 3. 0 T (90. 9 %, p = 0. 03). The sensitivity decreased from 99. 1 % at 1. 5 T to 92. 5 % at 3. 0 T (p = 0. 06) and the specificity from 97. 8 % to 84. 1 % (p = 0. 002). ADC map readings did not improve accuracy, sensitivity, or specificity. The false-negative rate was 0. 6 % at 1. 5 T and 6. 1 % at 3. 0 T. Type of readers, stroke severity, and type of the coil did not affect diagnosis value. SNR and CNR were significantly higher at 3 T (p < 0. 0001) but DWI contrast was lower (p = 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Blind</b> <b>reading</b> by 4 experts of a large series of images shows that 1. 5 -T diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) is better than 3. 0 -T DWI for the imaging of hyperacute stroke during the therapeutic window of thrombolysis...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Two macrocyclic {{extracellular}} contrast agents, one-molar neutral gadobutrol and ionic gadoterate meglumine, {{were compared}} to determine the overall preference for {{one or the other}} in a clinical setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multicenter, randomized, single-blind, intra-individually controlled, comparison study with a corresponding <b>blinded</b> <b>read.</b> Efficacy analysis was based on 136 patients who underwent identical MRI examinations: group A first received 1. 0 M gadobutrol followed by 0. 5 M gadoterate meglumine 48 h to 7 days later; group B had a reversed administration order. Three independent blinded readers assessed off-site their overall diagnostic preference (primary efficacy parameter) based on a matched pairs approach. RESULTS: Superiority of gadobutrol over gadoterate meglumine was demonstrated for the qualitative assessment of overall preference across all readers by a statistically significant difference between both contrast agents for this primary endpoint. Preferences in lesion enhancement (secondary endpoint) were also found significantly in favor of gadobutrol. For preference in lesion delineation from surrounding tissue/edema and for internal structure only a trend towards a higher proportion for gadobutrol was found (except for internal structure reported by one reader, which showed a result of statistical significance). Lesion contrast and relative lesion enhancement (quantitative parameters) were statistically significantly higher for gadobutrol compared to gadoterate meglumine. CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced MRI of neoplastic brain lesions at a dose of 0. 1 mmol Gd/kg body weight, assessed in a standardized off-site <b>blinded</b> <b>reading,</b> results in a significantly higher qualitative and quantitative preference for gadobutrol compared to gadoterate meglumine...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To prospectively {{determine}} the screening mammography outcome at blinded and non-blinded double reading in a biennial population based screening programme {{in the south}} of the Netherlands. METHODS: We included a consecutive series of 87, 487 digital screening mammograms, obtained between July 2009 and July 2011. Screening mammograms were double read in either a blinded (2 nd reader was not informed about the 1 st reader's decision) or non-blinded fashion (2 nd reader was informed about the 1 st reader's decision). This reading strategy was alternated on a monthly basis. Women with discrepant readings between the two radiologists were always referred for further analysis. During 2 years follow-up, we collected the radiology reports, surgical correspondence and pathology reports of all referred women and interval breast cancers. RESULTS: Respectively 44, 491 and 42, 996 screens had been read either in a blinded or non-blinded fashion. Referral rate (3. 3 % versus 2. 8 %, p< 0. 001) and false positive rate (2. 6 % versus 2. 2 %, p= 0. 002) were significantly higher at <b>blinded</b> double <b>reading</b> whereas the cancer detection rate per 1000 screens (7. 4 versus 6. 5, p= 0. 14) and positive predictive value of referral (22 % versus 23 %, p= 0. 51) were comparable. <b>Blinded</b> double <b>reading</b> resulted in a significantly higher programme sensitivity (83 % versus 76 %, p= 0. 01). Per 1000 screened women, <b>blinded</b> double <b>reading</b> would yield 0. 9 more screen detected cancers and 0. 6 less interval cancers than non-blinded double reading, at the expense of 4. 4 more recalls.

Weighted average 120 kV images and iodine maps were created with post-processing. Two observers performed a <b>blinded</b> <b>read</b> for colorectal lesions after being trained on three colorectal cancer patients. One observer performed an unblinded read for lesion detectability and placed a region of interest (ROI) within each lesion. In total 21 patients were included and 18 had a colorectal cancer {{at the time of}} the CT acquisition. Median cancer size was 43 mm [interquartile range (IQR) 27 - 60 mm] and all 18 colorectal cancers were visible on the 120 kV images and iodine map during the unblinded <b>read.</b> During the <b>blinded</b> <b>read,</b> observers found 90 % (27 / 30) of the cancers with 120 kV images only and 96. 7 % (29 / 30) after viewing the iodine map in addition (p = 0. 5).
