25|$|The 6-vertex {{edge ring}} does {{not conform to}} the shape of a perfect hexagon. The {{conformation}} of a flat 2D planar hexagon has considerable angle strain because its bonds are not 109.5 degrees; the torsional strain would also be considerable because all of the bonds would be eclipsed bonds. Therefore, to reduce torsional strain, cyclohexane adopts a three-dimensional structure known as the chair conformation. There are also two other intermediate conformers; half chair, which is the most unstable conformer, and twist boat, which is more stable than the boat conformer. This was first proposed as early as 1890 by Hermann Sachse, but only gained widespread acceptance much later. The new conformation puts the carbons at an angle of 109.5°. Half of the hydrogens are in the plane of the ring (equatorial) while the other half are perpendicular to the plane (axial). This conformation allows for the most stable structure of cyclohexane. Another conformation of cyclohexane exists, known as <b>boat</b> <b>conformation,</b> but it interconverts to the slightly more stable chair formation. If cyclohexane is mono-substituted with a large substituent, then the substituent will most likely be found attached in an equatorial position, as this is the slightly more stable conformation.|$|E

50|$|The <b>boat</b> <b>conformation</b> (4, below) {{is also a}} {{transition}} state, allowing the interconversion between two different twist-boat conformations. While the <b>boat</b> <b>conformation</b> is not necessary for interconversion between the two chair conformations of cyclohexane, it is often included in the reaction coordinate diagram used to describe this interconversion because its energy is considerably {{lower than that of}} the half-chair, so any molecule with enough energy to go from twist-boat to chair also has enough energy to go from twist-boat to boat. Thus, there are multiple pathways by which a molecule of cyclohexane in the twist-boat conformation can achieve the chair conformation again.|$|E

50|$|Conformational {{isomerism}} {{is a form}} of isomerism {{that describes}} the phenomenon of molecules with the same structural formula but with different shapes due to rotations about one or more bonds.

For example, cyclohexane can exist in a variety of different conformations including a chair conformation and a <b>boat</b> <b>conformation,</b> but, for cyclohexane itself, these can never be separated.

50|$|In {{the basic}} <b>boat</b> <b>conformation</b> (C2v symmetry), carbons C2, C3, C5 and C6 are coplanar, while C1 and C4 are {{displaced}} {{away from that}} plane in the same direction. Bonds C2-C3 and C5-C6 are therefore parallel. In this form, the molecule has two perpendicular planes of symmetry {{as well as a}} C2 axis. The boat conformations have higher energy than the chair conformations. The interaction between the two flagpole hydrogens, in particular, generates steric strain. There is also torsional strain involving the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds, which are eclipsed. Because of this strain, the boat configuration is unstable (not a local minimum of the energy function). The twist-boat conformation, sometimes called twist (D2 symmetry) can be derived from the <b>boat</b> <b>conformation</b> by applying a slight twist to the molecule about the axes connecting the two unique carbons. The result is a structure that has three C2 axes and no plane of symmetry. The concentration of the twist-boat conformation at room temperature is very low (less than 0.1%) but at 1073 kelvins it can reach 30%. Rapid cooling from 1073 K to 40 K will freeze in a large concentration of twist-boat conformation, which will then slowly convert to the chair conformation upon heating. The half-chair conformation is a transition state with C2 symmetry generally considered to be on the pathway between chair and twist-boat. It involves rotating one of the dihedrals to zero such that four adjacent atoms are coplanar and the other two atoms are out of plane (one above and one below).|$|E
50|$|According to the {{traditional}} picture, Lonsdaleite has a hexagonal unit cell, related to the diamond unit cell {{in the same way}} that the hexagonal and cubic close packed crystal systems are related. The diamond structure can be considered to be made up of interlocking rings of six carbon atoms, in the chair conformation. In lonsdaleite, some rings are in the <b>boat</b> <b>conformation</b> instead. At the nanoscale dimensions cubic diamond is represented by diamondoids while hexagonal diamond is represented by wurtzoids. In diamond, all the carbon-to-carbon bonds, both within a layer of rings and between them, are in the staggered conformation, thus causing all four cubic-diagonal directions to be equivalent; while in lonsdaleite the bonds between layers are in the eclipsed conformation, which defines the axis of hexagonal symmetry.|$|E
