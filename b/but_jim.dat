5|$|After ruining an improv class, Michael {{decides to}} crash Jim's party, {{much to the}} staff's dismay and Dwight's naïve delight. Michael awkwardly tries his hand at karaoke <b>but</b> <b>Jim</b> then joins in, easing the tension considerably. The {{documentary}} crew catches Angela and Dwight making out in Jim's backyard.|$|E
5|$|Many workers {{seen in the}} {{background}} of the first season are developed into secondary characters, and romantic relationships begin to develop between some of the characters. Michael spends the night with his boss Jan, {{in the wake of the}} latter's divorce, but does not sleep with her. Dwight and Angela become romantically involved, but keep the relationship a secret from everyone else. Kelly develops a crush on Ryan, and they start dating. When Roy sets a date for his wedding to Pam, Jim grows depressed and considers transferring to the Stamford, Connecticut branch, but tells Pam in the season finale that he loves her, even though Pam still insists she will marry Roy. The two kiss, <b>but</b> <b>Jim</b> transfers to the Stamford branch soon after. The general threat of downsizing continues throughout the season as well.|$|E

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Yokozuna and The Undertaker began at Survivor Series 1993. Yokozuna, who was pushed as an unstoppable monster, {{was unable to}} inflict any serious damage on The Undertaker when the two faced each other in an {{elimination}} match. Yokozuna slammed The Undertaker's head into the steel steps {{leading up to the}} ring, but The Undertaker was unharmed. Later, Yokozuna used his finishing move, the Banzai Drop, on The Undertaker. When he tried to repeat the move, however, The Undertaker became the first wrestler to sit up after the move, surprising Yokozuna and his managers. The Undertaker was granted a title shot, <b>but</b> <b>Jim</b> Cornette, Yokozuna's American spokesperson, included a clause in the contract that The Undertaker would not get a rematch if he lost. Paul Bearer, The Undertaker's manager, included a clause stating that the confrontation would take place in a Casket match. In the following weeks, it was revealed that Yokozuna had a fear of caskets. The Undertaker used this knowledge to gain a psychological advantage going into the match. On one occasion, Paul Bearer brought the casket to the ring to intimidate Yokozuna. When Yokozuna approached the casket to face his fear, the Undertaker popped out to scare Yokozuna.|$|E
5|$|When Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is irritated that Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{will not}} fulfill his {{landlord}} responsibilities and fix the dangerously substandard office wiring, {{he comes up}} with a plan to pretend that magnetic power is affecting the office and thus get the repairs as well as a week off from work for his wife Pam (Jenna Fischer) (whom he is trying to be extra nice to in the wake of not telling her about his new job plans). Dwight calls Jim's bluff and rents an overcrowded bus for the staff to work on, <b>but</b> <b>Jim</b> harnesses the office workers' love of a local pie stand to please Pam. Dwight eventually gets angry and climbs into the roof of the bus, refusing to drive any further. Pam suspects something else is wrong and asks Jim to talk to him. Jim learns that Dwight thought his magnetic power prank was real as he suspects he is infertile, which he has convinced himself explains why he was not the father of Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) baby. Jim tells Dwight he is like a father to the entire office, and Dwight then drives everyone to the pie stand where they have a great finish to their day.|$|E

50|$|The title {{refers to}} women who helped him {{after the death of}} his wife, <b>but</b> <b>Jim's</b> view of life is {{distorted}} and strange. This makes him ideal material for LSD experiments, but he soon dismisses this. His view of humanity is that of a constant need to view lives and violence, and indeed, sex, through a camera, via TV. And just look at Big Brother.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} part we witness Oliver in a {{touching}} moment comforting <b>Jim</b> Darnley's mother, <b>but</b> he is only {{able to do so}} because he mimics Jim. Oliver again proves his goodness by proposing to adopt Jim Darnley's bastard son, <b>but</b> <b>Jim's</b> sister Rose crushes this proposal. All they really need is Oliver's money, and Rose says that Oliver wouldn't be capable of raising the boy in any other manner.|$|R

25|$|Before {{his date}} with Claudia, Jim takes fire during a pursuit and loses his gun. When he meets Claudia they {{promise to be}} honest with each other, so he confesses his ineptitude as a cop and admits he has not been on a date since he was {{divorced}} three years earlier. Claudia says he will hate her because of her problems, <b>but</b> <b>Jim</b> assures her that her past does not matter. They kiss, but she runs off.|$|E

60|$|Nobody {{had seen}} what had {{happened}} and the train whisked briskly away round a curve in the barrens. Rilla picked herself up, dizzy but unhurt, scrambled out of the ditch, and flew wildly across the platform, expecting to find Jims dead or broken in pieces. <b>But</b> <b>Jims,</b> except for a few bruises, and a big fright, was quite uninjured. He was so badly scared that he didn't even cry, but Rilla, when she found that he was safe and sound, burst into tears and sobbed wildly.|$|R
25|$|Laramie {{was named}} for Jacques LaRamie, a French or French-Canadian trapper who {{disappeared}} in the Laramie Mountains in the late 1810s and was never heard from again. He {{was one of the}} first Europeans to visit the area. European-American settlers named a river, mountain range, peak, US Army fort, county, and city for him. More Wyoming landmarks are named for him than for any other trapper <b>but</b> <b>Jim</b> Bridger. Because the name was used so frequently, the town was called Laramie City for decades to distinguish it from other uses.|$|E
25|$|Police officer Jim Kurring investigates a {{disturbance}} at a woman's apartment, finding {{a body in}} a closet. Dixon, a neighborhood boy, tries to tell him who committed the murder <b>but</b> <b>Jim</b> is dismissive. Jim goes to the apartment of Claudia Wilson. Claudia's neighbors called the police after she had an argument with her estranged father, children's game show host Jimmy Gator, and then blasted music while snorting cocaine. Unaware of her addiction, Jim is attracted to her and prolongs the visit. He asks her on a date that night; she says yes.|$|E
25|$|Vito {{continued}} {{to spend time}} with Jim, <b>but</b> <b>Jim</b> eventually saw through his story about being a writer. Vito confessed to some of his past but {{continued to}} lie, claiming he was a divorced construction worker. Jim arranged for Vito to work as a handyman, but Vito soon tired of the tedium of a working life. Vito's drinking worsened. Finally, Vito decided to return to his former life in New Jersey. He cooked a dinner for Jim and left the next morning while Jim slept. Having discovered Vito's disappearance, Jim remained angry and when Vito tried reaching out to him via phone, Jim told Vito to stay out of his life before hanging up.|$|E

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>Jim's</b> words did {{not express}} all his thoughts. If he had {{revealed}} them fully {{he would have}} described a bright fireside in a small and humble but very comfortable room, with a smiling face that rendered sunshine unnecessary, {{and a pair of}} eyes that made gaslight a paltry flame as well as an absolute extravagance. That the name of this cheap, yet dear, luminary began with an N and ended with an a, is a piece of information with which we think it unnecessary to trouble the reader.|$|R

25|$|Derry's first {{match in}} the new system was a 3–1 League of Ireland Cup win over Home Farm of Dublin at the Brandywell on 8 September 1985. The return of senior {{football}} to Derry attracted large crowds. Later in the season, after turning professional, it won the League of Ireland First Division Shield with a 6–1 aggregate victory over Longford Town. The following year – 1987 – Derry won the First Division and promotion to the Premier Division, staying there since. The club reached the 1988 FAI Cup final, but lost to Dundalk. The next season – 1988–89 – the club was financially forced to revert to semi-professional status <b>but</b> <b>Jim</b> McLaughlin's side managed to win a treble; the league, the League Cup and the FAI Cup. Qualifying for the 1989–90 European Cup, it met past winners, Benfica, in the first round.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Jim's {{locomotive}} Molly, whom Jim and Luke {{had left}} at the cliffs when getting Mr. Tur Tur and Nepomuk, has been abducted by the band of pirates called the Wild 13. Luckily for Jim and Luke, the former Mrs. Grindtooth awakes as a Golden Dragon of Wisdom in China and can help them out with information and tells Jim how {{to find out about}} his origin. With the help of the Mandalanese emperor, Jim and Luke – and Princess Li Si as a stowaway – start their journey to meet the Wild 13 and rescue Molly. They encounter the pirates, who prove to be too much for them in battle. Molly is lost at sea, and all <b>but</b> <b>Jim</b> are captured and brought to the pirates' base, Castle Stormeye, a pinnacle of rock within the eye of a perpetual hurricane.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950–51 Ashes series the MCC {{tour manager}} Freddie Brown arrived at Melbourne for the Fifth and final Test having lost the series 4–0, but won the match {{and won a}} great ovation from the Australian crowd who admired his {{fighting}} spirit throughout the series. He now arrived with Peter May's team hoping {{to do the same}} and the players were keen to salvage something from the tour. Arthur Milton was sent home with his broken finger, Brian Statham and Peter Loader had been injured in a car accident when their tyre blew, Godfrey Evans was still recovering from his broken finger and Willie Watson suffered a groin strain bowling in the nets. This reduced the touring team to 13 fit players, <b>but</b> <b>Jim</b> Laker was ready to play and returned to the team with Ted Dexter and Roy Swetman. Tony Lock's 5 wickets had cost 75.20 and was dropped in favour of debutant off-spinner John Mortimore. This was a surprise for the Australians, but even more so to Lock, who heard the news on the radio. The home team dropped batsman Les Favell in favour of the fast bowler Ian Meckiff whose bruised foot had healed. Mel McInnes was replaced as umpire by Les Townsend in his only Test as umpire.|$|E

25|$|Despite taking pole {{position}} {{in the first two}} rounds, mechanical problems halted his chances of victory. He spun numerous times in South Africa, and at Monaco, his engine blew up at the start, and the win went to his teammate Denny Hulme. At the Dutch Grand Prix, he scored his first podium of the season, with second place, behind Scotsman Jim Clark. He retired in the Belgian Grand Prix with another blown engine. He fixed this by winning the French Grand Prix at the Bugatti Circuit in Le Mans. He came fourth at the British Grand Prix, behind Chris Amon, his teammate Hulme, and Clark. At the German Grand Prix, he had a huge battle with Amon, and Brabham eventually finished ahead of the New Zealander, by only half a second. Hulme was the winner. At the first ever Canadian Grand Prix at Mosport Park, he took a huge win, ahead of Hulme, in cold and rainy conditions. At the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Brabham had to finish second, only a few car lengths behind John Surtees, who took his last GP win. Hulme retired from the race, cutting the gap to 3 points between the two, as the circus headed for the United States, at Watkins Glen for the United States Grand Prix. Brabham outqualified his teammate, and finished fifth in the race, and with Hulme on the podium, this meant the championship chances were looking slim for Black Jack, as the circus went to Mexico for the championship deciding and final race of the season. Once again, Black Jack outqualified his teammate, and needed to win, with Hulme fifth or lower. <b>But</b> <b>Jim</b> Clark was simply too fast during the whole weekend, and dominated the race from pole to win, with Brabham finishing over 1 minute and 25 seconds behind. Hulme finished third, and so the New Zealander won the championship, while Brabham settled for second place. The team secured the Constructors' Championship, with 67 total points scored, and 23 points ahead of Lotus which scored a total of 44 points.|$|E
