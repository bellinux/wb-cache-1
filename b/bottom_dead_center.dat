2500|$|While {{the side}} rods (UK: {{coupling}} rods) of a locomotive can be completely balanced by weights on the driving wheels since their motion is completely rotational, the reciprocating {{motions of the}} pistons, piston rods, main rods and valve gear cannot be balanced in this way. A two-cylinder locomotive has its two cranks [...] "quartered" [...] — set at 90° apart — so that the four power strokes of the double-acting pistons are evenly distributed around the cycle {{and there are no}} points at which both cylinders are at top or <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> simultaneously. A four-cylinder locomotive can be completely balanced in the longitudinal and vertical axes, although there are some rocking and twisting motions which can be dealt with in the locomotive's suspension and centering; a three-cylinder locomotive can also be better balanced, but a two-cylinder locomotive only balanced for rotation will surge fore and aft. Additional balance weight — [...] "overbalance" [...] — can be added to damp this, but at the cost of adding vertical forces, which are known technically as [...] "dynamic augment" [...] and colloquially as [...] "hammer blow". This can be extremely damaging to the track, and in extreme cases can actually cause the driving wheels to leave the track entirely. The heavier the reciprocating machinery, the greater these forces are, and the greater a problem this becomes.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} investigation of homogeneous charge compression ignition in a free-oscillating two-stroke free-piston engine. The Free Piston Linear Generator (FPLG), which is being developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), is an innovative internal combustion engine for the generation of electrical power. This concept can for example be used in hybrid electric vehicles, as an auxiliary power unit or in {{combined heat and power}} units. The FPLG consists of three main components. In the two-stroke combustion unit, heat is released by burning a fuel-air mixture and a piston is accelerated. This energy is then converted into electric energy in the second component, the linear generator. This subsystem consists of electromagnetic coils as a stator and permanent magnets as a mover. The mover is rigidly coupled to the combustion piston. The third component, the gas spring, serves as an intermediate energy storage and reverses the piston motion by decelerating it. With this arrangement, the piston oscillates freely between the compression chamber of the combustion unit and the gas spring with no mechanical coupling like a crank shaft. Due to the free piston movement, the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centers</b> and consequently for example the compression ratio are no longer fixed. This freedom and the use of a fully variable valve train provide the opportunity for a fundamental optimization of the internal combustion process. The homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) is one advantageous combustion process which leads to low raw emissions and high efficiencies. As a basis to utilize a HCCI process, the paper firstly presents a strategy for the transition between the spark ignition mode and HCCI-mode in the FPLG using the high variability of the engine concept. The auto ignition of the lean fuel-air mixture is enabled by the adaption of the compression ratio and an internal exhaust gas recirculation. The latter is accomplished by an early intake valve opening and intermediate storage of combustion gases in the intake manifold. Additionally, the challenges that come with a freely oscillating piston will be discussed here. In the analysis of the experimental results, the pressure curve and free piston movement will be discussed in detail. Due to the free piston movement stochastic variations in the ignition can be equalized by the system without external control. This effect and the measured efficiencies show the promising potential for the HCCI process in free-piston engines...|$|R
40|$|The German Aerospace Center (DLR) is {{developing}} a free-piston engine as an innovative internal combustion engine for the generation of electrical power. The arrangement of the Free Piston Linear Generator (FPLG) in opposed-piston design consists of two piston units oscillating freely, thereby alternately compressing the common combustion chamber {{in the center of}} the unit and gas springs on either side. Linear alternators convert the kinetic energy of the moving pistons into electric energy. Since the pistons are not mechanically coupled to a crank train, the <b>bottom</b> and top <b>dead</b> <b>centers</b> of the piston movement can be varied during operation e. g. to adjust the compression ratio. Utilizing these degrees of freedom, the present paper deals with the analysis of different combustion processes in a port scavenged opposed-piston combustion chamber prototype. This contains the experimental investigation of spark ignition (SI) as well as the transition to homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI). Based on test bench results, a 3 D-CFD model, which has been used to develop the first prototype, is calibrated by actual measurements. The simulation results enable a deeper analysis of scavenging and in-cylinder processes exceeding the measurement possibilities on a test bench...|$|R

The WHE engine has an exhaust valve in each piston actuated by a protrusion on the connecting rod (see figure to right). On the exhaust stroke {{the angle of the}} connecting rod causes it to open the piston valve, allowing expanded steam to exhaust into the crankcase.|$|E
50|$|The {{carburetor}} typically {{contains a}} float bowl {{into which the}} expelled fuel is pumped. When the fuel level in the float bowl exceeds a certain level, the inlet valve to the carburetor will close, preventing the fuel pump from pumping more fuel into the carburetor.

This allowed both cylinders to have the same axis. It also had the torque reaction of one crankshaft cancel the torque reaction of the other, cancelling torque reaction in the engine. The pistons in the Lanchester engine moved so that one piston was on top while the other was at <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center,</b> creating an uneven firing cycle.

5000|$|As {{a result}} of [...] "resonance tuning", some {{naturally}} aspirated intake systems operate at a volumetric efficiency above 100%: the air pressure in the combustion chamber before the compression stroke {{is greater than the}} atmospheric pressure. In combination with this intake manifold design feature, the exhaust manifold design, as well as the exhaust valve opening time can be so calibrated as to achieve greater evacuation of the cylinder. The exhaust manifolds achieve a vacuum in the cylinder just before the piston reaches top dead center. The opening inlet valve can then—at typical compression ratios—fill 10% of the cylinder before beginning downward travel. Instead of achieving higher pressure in the cylinder, the inlet valve can stay open after the piston reaches <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> while the air still flows in.|$|E

Standard modes of operation with up to date safe press controls are OFF-INCH-SINGLE STROKE & CONTINUOUS modes which can be selected via a keyed mode selector switch. Special modes of operation include, MICRO INCH-SSD/SINGLE ON DEMAND & CSD/CONTINUOUS ON DEMAND. Micro Inch is normally used for die set up near the BDC / <b>Bottom</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>Center,</b> SSD Single Stroke on Demand can be used when long coil feed lengths or automation loading and unloading will trigger SSD.

5000|$|In 1913, Louis Seguin and {{his brother}} Laurent (engineers who founded the Société Des Moteurs Gnome Gnome motor company in 1905) {{introduced}} the new Monosoupape series, which eliminated the inlet valve, replacing it with piston-controlled transfer ports {{similar to those found}} in a two-stroke engine. Beginning with the power stroke, the four-stroke engine operated normally until the piston was just about to reach the bottom of its stroke (<b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center,</b> or BDC), when the exhaust valve was opened [...] "early". This let the still-hot burnt combustion gases [...] "pop" [...] out of the engine while the piston was still moving down, relieving exhaust pressure and preventing exhaust gases from entering the crankcase. After a small additional amount of travel, the piston uncovered 36 small ports {{around the base of the}} cylinder, leading to the crankcase which held additional fuel-air mixture (the charge). No transfer took place at this point since there was no pressure differential; the cylinder was still open to the air and thus at ambient pressure. The overhead valve exhausted directly into the slipstream since no exhaust manifold could be practically fitted to the spinning crankcase and cylinders, partly in order to save weight and prevent excessive amounts of centrifugal forces in flight.|$|E
