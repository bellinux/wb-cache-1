In 2007 – 08 stem rust was absent in all locations tested except Montelibretti (Rome, Central Italy), where two <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> varieties “Arsenal” and “Compair” had stem rust infections. Two stem rust pathotypes were identified by testing in the greenhouse a set of differential lines/varieties carrying known genes for resistance to Puccinia graminis. These pathotypes corresponded to races MSK and PTK {{on the basis of the}} North American classification system. Genes Sr 24 and Sr 25 (both derived from Thinopyrum ponticum) and Sr 31 (from Secale cereale), were resistant to the Italian pathotypes, and the lines carrying Sr 38 (from Triticum ventricosum) were susceptible. Tests were carried out to determine the seedling stem rust response of durum and <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> cultivars grown in Italy.

40|$|Background The {{large and}} complex {{hexaploid}} genome has greatly hindered genomics studies of <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> (Triticum aestivum, AABBDD). Here, we investigated transcripts in <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> developing caryopses using the emerging single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology PacBio RSII, and assessed the resultant data for improving <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> genome annotation and grain transcriptome research. Results We obtained 197, 709 full-length non-chimeric (FLNC) reads, 74. 6  % {{of which were}} estimated to carry complete open reading frame. A total of 91, 881 high-quality FLNC reads were identified and mapped to 16, 188 chromosomal loci, corresponding to 13, 162 known genes and 3026 new genes not annotated previously. Although some FLNC reads could not be unambiguously mapped to the current draft genome sequence, {{many of them are}} likely useful for studying highly similar homoeologous or paralogous loci or for improving chromosomal contig assembly in further research. The 91, 881 high-quality FLNC reads represented 22, 768 unique transcripts, 9591 of which were newly discovered. We found 180 transcripts each spanning two or three previously annotated adjacent loci, suggesting that they should be merged to form correct gene models. Finally, our data facilitated the identification of 6030 genes differentially regulated during caryopsis development, and full-length transcripts for 72 transcribed gluten gene members that are important for the end-use quality control of <b>common</b> <b>wheat.</b> Conclusions Our work demonstrated the value of PacBio transcript sequencing for improving <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> genome annotation through uncovering the loci and full-length transcripts not discovered previously.

The main objectives of this study were to compare the yield potential and growth characteristics of spring spelt wheat to that of <b>common</b> spring <b>wheat</b> (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Thell) in central Saskatchewan, using growth analysis; to investigate the response of spring spelt to seeding date; and to determine the effect of the hulls of spelt on seedling emergence and establishment under adverse temperature and moisture conditions. The seeding rate and growth analysis experiment was conducted in the field using two spring spelt cultivars (CDC Bavaria and PGR 8801) and a <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> cultivar (Katepwa) at four seeding rates ranging from 150 to 450 seeds/m 2 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, in 1995 and 1996. The response of spring spelt and <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> to seeding date was measured from late April to early June under field conditions over two years. The role of spelt hulls on seed germination, seedling emergence and crop establishment was studied under field conditions using an early (late April) and a late (early June) date of seeding over two years. Seed germination, seedling establishment and seed water uptake were studied under controlled environment conditions at water potentials ranging from 0 to - 1. 8 MPa, at temperatures of 9, 16 and 23 °C. The field studies indicated that spring spelt can produce grain yield comparable to <b>common</b> <b>wheat.</b> The same seeding rate as <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> (150 to 250 seeds/m 2) can be used for spring spelt wheat in central Saskatchewan. Spring spelt has a higher leaf area index (LAI), leaf area duration (LAD) and crop growth rate (CGR) than <b>common</b> <b>wheat,</b> giving rise to 24 per cent higher biological yield for spring spelt compared to that of <b>common</b> <b>wheat.</b> Optimal seeding date for spring spelt is late April to early May; with later seeding spring spelt's grain yield tends to decrease. Seedling establishment for spring spelt is lower and less stable than <b>common</b> <b>wheat,</b> though this variation in seedling plant density does not influence the final grain yield. Controlled environment studies indicated that the hull of spring spelt wheat acts as an obstacle to water uptake, leading to an approximate 25 per cent slower water uptake rate compared to naked seeds. The hull has negative impact on seed germination and seedling emergence. The negative impact of the hull on seed water uptake, seed germination and seedling emergence increases under drought conditions. Thus, only under sufficiently wet soil conditions may using hulled seed as the propagule lead to comparable establishment of spring spelt relative to <b>common</b> <b>wheat.</b> In conclusion, spring spelt can be grown successfully in central Saskatchewan, producing a comparable grain yield to <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> provided it is seeded before mid-May...|$|R
