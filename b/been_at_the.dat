5|$|Alice Grey {{was accused}} with Katherine Hewitt {{of the murder}} of Anne Foulds. Potts does not provide an account of Alice Grey's trial, simply {{recording}} her as one of the Samlesbury witches – which she was not, as {{she was one of those}} identified as having <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Malkin Tower meeting – and naming her in the list of those found not guilty.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological discoveries {{show that}} the first {{settlements}} {{in the area of}} present-day Białystok occurred during the Stone Age. Tombs of ancient settlers {{can be found in the}} district of Dojlidy. In the early Iron Age a mix of Prussians, Yotvingians and Wielbark culture people settled in the area producing kurgans, the tombs of the chiefs in the area located in the current village of Rostołty. Since then, the Białystok area has <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crossroads of cultures. Trade routes linking the Baltic to the Black Sea favored the development of settlements with Yotvingia-Ruthenian-Polish cultural characteristics.|$|E
5|$|As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} with tiny, two-fingered {{hands and}} a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may have <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top {{of the food chain}} in its local ecosystem. While Albertosaurus was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative Tyrannosaurus rex, growing nine to ten meters long and weighing less than possibly 2 metric tons.|$|E

5|$|Confusion arose when {{an issue}} of the French daily {{newspaper}} Le Petit Journal, published on 24 July 1904 {{on the occasion of}} the bey of Tunis's visit to France, reproduced an illustration showing the flag used while was visiting the Hôtel de Ville, Paris. Ivan Sache of Flags of the World claimed that this flag design, which hadn't been seen earlier, may have been inaccurate, suggesting that the journalist might not have <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> affair or he had reproduced a drawing of the wrong flag.|$|E
5|$|Durran's costumes {{also helped}} emphasise social {{rank among the}} {{different}} characters; Caroline Bingley for instance is introduced in an empire silhouetted dress, clothing that would have then <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> height of fashion. During her interview, Durran opined that all the women wear white at the Netherfield Ball due to its contemporary popularity, an idea that Wright credits as his reason for hiring her. All of the costumes were handmade, as clothing was at the time. However, costumes and hairstyles were adjusted to appeal to contemporary audiences, sacrificing historical accuracy.|$|E
5|$|Federer and Nadal {{remained}} the lead rivalry, and the pair {{met in the}} final of both the French Open and Wimbledon. Nadal won both, with the latter described {{as one of the}} greatest tennis matches of all time. In August 2008, after winning the 2008 Summer Olympics gold medal, Nadal passed Federer to become world No. 1, after Federer had <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top for a record 237 consecutive weeks.|$|E

5|$|The {{front part}} of a skull (specimen NMP P6V-004389, a syntype of this species) in the National Museum of Prague was found in 1850 among {{the remains of the}} Böhmisches Museum. Other {{elements}} supposedly belonging to this specimen have been listed in the literature, but it appears only the partial skull was ever present. It may be what remains of one of the stuffed dodos known to have <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> menagerie of Emperor Rudolph II, possibly the specimen painted by Hoefnagel or Savery there.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} cause of {{collapse}} at Tikal is overpopulation and agrarian failure. The fall of Tikal was {{a blow to}} the heart of Classic Maya civilization, the city having <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> forefront of courtly life, art and architecture for over a thousand years, with an ancient ruling dynasty. However, new research regarding paleoenvironmental proxies from the Tikal reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of Tikal.|$|E
5|$|The route was {{approved}} {{and the bill}} received royal assent on 28 March 1893 as the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1893.

5|$|A third person, former UDR soldier John James Somerville (aged 37, a lorry-helper and {{the brother}} of Wesley), was arrested {{following}} an RUC raid in Dungannon on 26 September 1980. He was charged with the Miami Showband murders, the attempted murder of Stephen Travers, and the murder of Patrick Falls in 1974. He was given {{a total of four}} life sentences (three for the murders of the Miami Showband members and one for the Falls murder) on 9 November 1981; he had pleaded not guilty. The three convicted UVF men, although admitting to having <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> scene, denied having shot anyone. None of the men ever named their accomplices, and the other UVF gunmen were never caught. The three men were sent to serve their sentence in the Maze Prison, on the outskirts of Lisburn. Fortnight Magazine reported that on 1 June 1982, John James Somerville began a hunger strike at the Maze to obtain special category status. Crozier, McDowell, and Somerville were released after 1998 {{under the terms of the}} Belfast Agreement.|$|E
5|$|Antigua and Barbuda {{participated in}} eight Olympic Games between its debut at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montréal and its 2008 {{appearance}} in Beijing, competing in every edition {{except for the}} 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. The 2008 Summer Olympic delegation was smaller {{than those of the}} 1980s and 1990s, when they were composed of thirteen or more athletes, but, with five participants, it was the same size that it had <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. As of the conclusion of the Beijing Games, no Antiguan or Barbudan athlete has won a medal, although Brendan Christian progressed to semifinals and Daniel Bailey to quarterfinals of their respective events in 2008. At the 2008 games Kareem Valentine was the youngest athlete at fifteen years of age and Sonia Williams was the eldest at twenty-nine.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he had <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E

2500|$|The {{theoretical}} basis for thermometers is the zeroth law of thermodynamics which postulates {{that if you}} have three bodies, A, B and C, if A and B <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same temperature, and B and C <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same temperature then A and C <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same temperature.

5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an {{acknowledgement of the}} predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave {{the details of his}} sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E
5|$|Dougan {{stood as}} an {{independent}} 'Former Captain NI Football Team' candidate for the East Belfast constituency in the 1997 UK general election, but got only 541 votes and finished seventh out of the nine candidates. In April 2000, he was cleared of aggravated burglary following a trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court; the incident had been alleged {{to have taken place}} at the home of Patricia Thompson, a former lover. He was also cleared of assaulting a Vietnam War veteran with a pool cue, who had <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> home with Patricia Thompson {{at the time of the}} alleged burglary incident. In another court case, again in April 2000, Dougan failed to attend a hearing where he had been charged with driving carelessly and failing to comply with a red traffic signal; he said he had been unable to attend because he had a dental appointment.|$|E
5|$|During {{a severe}} local {{recession}} in 1985 the 36-year-old hotel, still {{the second largest}} in Houston but by then in need of extensive refurbishing and refitting, was in effect donated to the Texas Medical Center. In March 1986 a protest rally was held by historic preservationists including McCarthy and the hotel opened its last annual St Patrick's Day party to the public. That evening, some people who had <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> opening night party in 1949 reportedly attended a semi-formal event in the hotel's Emerald room. A few employees {{had been with the}} hotel since its first year of operation. The building was demolished 1 June 1987 (McCarthy died 18 months later) and the land was paved over as a surface parking lot. The Institute of Biosciences and Technology, a component of the Texas A Health Science Center has since been built on the site and ironically, along with fountains and some landscaping on the northeast grounds, the hotel's multi-story parking garage was retained.|$|E
