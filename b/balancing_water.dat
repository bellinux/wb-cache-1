This report compares {{water security}} issues in two Australian mining communities. Kalgoorlie in Western Australia and Broken Hill in New South Wales are towns with populations of around 30, 000 and 20, 000 respectively in semi-arid environments with limited local water supplies. Each has a rich history based on mineral resources and, more recently, a developing tourism industry. The catalyst for development has been the exploitation of mineral resources (silver, zinc and lead in Broken Hill and gold in Kalgoorlie); this development has been constrained and tested by water limitations. Throughout the history of each town, the reaction to extreme dry periods and economic booms has been to develop new infrastructure and strategies to deliver more water and increase efficiencies.

Due to the development of water resources, for example through the construction of reservoirs, the natural flow regime is altered which results in changes in the river and floodplain ecosystem. Environmental flows describe the river flow regime necessary to protect the river ecosystem. The importance of this ecosystem for peoples' food, income, health or other purposes, are referred to in this thesis as the human well-being values of environmental flows. The thesis provides an approach to quantify the relationship between river flows, the river ecosystem and human well-being values and discusses the application of this approach in two case studies, in Bangladesh and in Iran.

Many studies have been done on the topic of water {{resources}} and climate change, but they mainly emphasize on how the changing climate affects water quality. When water quality is decreasing, the quantity of water supply will be affected as well. <b>Balancing</b> <b>water</b> supply and water demand is very critical for sustainable development, because the wellbeing of human lives and sensitive ecosystems depend on reliable water sources. This paper explores the pattern of domestic per-capita water use in various climatic regions and the influence of climatic conditions, demographic variations, and demand management policies on water use. My research focuses on nine climatic regions across the U. S. I focus my research around the following questions: 1) how does per-capita domestic water use vary across various climatic regions, 2) how do the various water demand management policies vary across climatic regions, and 3) how do climatic conditions, demographic factors, and water demand management policies relate to domestic per-capita water use...|$|E

30|$|Climate {{change with}} {{increased}} temperature, reduced stream flow and water quality, and drought conditions also significantly affect survival {{and distribution of}} salmon and cold water fish species and critical habitats in Delta, and San Joaquin and Sacramento watersheds in California. It becomes even more challenging to maintain viable salmon populations with continued drought and ongoing climate change (Perry et al 2016). Climate change effects, including warmer water and reduced outflows as well as changes in precipitation, are already affecting the Delta ecosystems. These changes could significantly affect historic Delta smelt habitat to be uninhabitable by smelt {{during the summer and}} early fall (Moyle et al. 2016). Such high temperatures will also restrict distribution of smelt and inhibit their recovery (Brown et al. 2013, 2016). A major consideration in <b>balancing</b> <b>water</b> supply and environmental needs is to prevent the extinction of native species, such as Delta smelt in Bay Delta California, especially during the drought. Delta smelt resiliency strategies and management actions have been developed based on science and conceptual models that address Delta smelt issues and promote their resiliency through the current drought and into future variations of their habitat conditions (California Natural Resources Agency 2016).|$|E
40|$|Transport {{phenomena}} play {{an important}} role in the performance of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell. Water generated by electrochemical reactions and transported by osmotic drag and back diffusion can cause saturation or flooding, preventing oxygen from reaching catalysis sites. Dehydration may also occur, resulting in poor proton conductivity. <b>Balancing</b> <b>water</b> content within the membrane involves judicious water and heat management strategies. In this paper, detailed mathematical models for the prediction of all significant aspects of physicochemical hydrodynamics for a proton exchange membrane fuel cell are employed. Fully coupled heat and mass transfer and electrochemistry are considered, and the dependence of water transport on these factors is taken into account. Two distinct approaches were considered: a fully three-dimensional approach and a hybrid scheme, whereby the electrochemistry and electric fields are treated as locally one dimensional in the membrane assembly. Comparisons between the two approaches are presented and discussed. The numerical results suggest a dependence of the rate-of-water removal on temperature, current density, and inlet humidification levels, and also that the oxygen concentration in the air channels significantly affects current density distribution.

N 2 O production through both heterotrophic and autotrophic pathways was included. Other GHG emissions were estimated using empirical relationships.

40|$|In {{order to}} develop climate {{resilient}} urban areas and reduce emissions, several opportunities exist starting from conscious planning and design of green (and blue) spaces in these landscapes. Green urban infrastructure has been regarded as beneficial, e. g. by <b>balancing</b> <b>water</b> flows, providing thermal comfort. This article explores the existing evidence on the contribution of green spaces to climate change mitigation and adaptation services. We suggest a framework of ecosystem services for systematizing the evidence on the provision of bio-physical benefits (e. g. CO 2 sequestration) {{as well as social}} and psychological benefits (e. g. improved health) that enable coping with (adaptation) or reducing the adverse effects (mitigation) of climate change. The multi-functional and multi-scale nature of green urban infrastructure complicates the categorization of services and benefits, since in reality the interactions between various benefits are manifold and appear on different scales. We will show the relevance of the benefits from green urban infrastructures on three spatial scales (i. e. city, neighborhood and site specific scales). We will further report on co-benefits and trade-offs between the various services indicating that a benefit could in turn be detrimental in relation to other functions. The manuscript identifies avenues for further research on the role of green urban infrastructure, in different types of cities, climates and social contexts. Our systematic understanding of the bio-physical and social processes defining various services allows targeting stressors that may hamper the provision of green urban infrastructure services in individual behavior as well as in wider planning and environmental management in urban areas. status: publishe...|$|E
