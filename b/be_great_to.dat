We both loved that song {{and we both}} {{thought it would be}} great for Weezer, and for my voice, and it’d <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> do like a rock version of it with more of an alternative aesthetic. And you know, just the way I would sing it versus in the way Toni Braxton would sing it. And I love the way it came out, and I think probably the rest of the band really does not like it, and that’s probably why it didn’t make our fifth record, in 2005 when we were recording it." ...|$|E
500|$|George Lucas {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film (originally titled Munchkins) in 1972. Similar in intent to Star Wars, he created [...] "a number of well-known mythological situations for a young audience". During the production of Return of the Jedi in 1982, Lucas approached Warwick Davis, who was portraying Wicket the Ewok, about playing Willow Ufgood. Five years passed before he was actually cast in the role. Lucas [...] "thought it would <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> use a little person in a lead role. A lot of my movies are about a little guy against the system, and this was just a more literal interpretation of that idea." ...|$|E

500|$|Ian Holm {{was cast}} as Mitchell Stephens after the actor {{originally}} set {{to play the}} character, Donald Sutherland, quit the project. In casting the part, Egoyan was inspired by Holm's [...] "strangely compassionate, yet furtive and menacing" [...] performance in The Homecoming (1973). Holm explained why he accepted the role, saying, [...] "It's not often you get offered a leading role at age 65... This is my first in a movie," [...] and afterwards said the film is [...] "very touching" [...] and [...] "a masterpiece." [...] Holm called his part challenging, as {{it was his first}} lead, but he found Egoyan and the Canadian actors to <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> work with.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, both Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were {{converted}} to 3-D for a two-week limited theatrical re-release, which was extended due to its success. Lasseter said, [...] "The Toy Story films and characters will always hold a very special place in our hearts and we're so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy {{in a whole new}} way, thanks to the latest in 3-D technology.

500|$|In July 2010, Feargus Urquhart, {{replying}} to {{an interview}} question about what franchises {{he would like to}} work on, said that [...] "if [...] could come across everything that [...] played", he would choose a Chrono Trigger game. At the time, Urquhart's company Obsidian Entertainment was making Dungeon Siege III for Square Enix. Urquhart said: [...] "You make RPGs, we make RPGs, it would <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> see what we could do together. And they really wanted to start getting into Western RPGs. And, so it kind of all ended up fitting together." [...] Yoshinori Kitase revealed in 2011 that he used the time travel mechanics of Chrono Trigger {{as a starting point for}} that of Final Fantasy XIII-2.|$|E

500|$|The game {{levels were}} {{developed}} {{on a level}} editor on the PlayStation Portable, but Zoë Mode {{were not able to}} refine the editor in time for shipping. [...] Mottram said [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> see user generated content and this is something we have been seriously thinking about for the future" [...] and that downloadable content [...] "would work perfectly with the Crush level structure and I am sure that fans of the game would be eager to see more levels." [...] Mottram has stated they would like to market a sequel based on the highly positive feedback they had received; however, with other Zoë Mode projects such as SingStar and Play taking precedence, he does not know when this could be.|$|E
500|$|In December 2007, Record Collector {{published}} {{an interview with}} Ray Davies in which he said, [...] "I spoke to Quaife {{about a month ago}} and he dearly wants to make another record with me. I think Dave's getting better and Mick's still playing. It would <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> get back together just to see what musical ideas we had, and what would happen." [...] The Daily Mail subsequently interpreted his comments as a declaration that a reunion of the band's original line-up was imminent. Dave Davies swiftly rejected the idea of a reunion. He told a reporter that [...] "it would be like a bad remake of Night of the Living Dead" [...] and added, [...] "Ray has been doing Karaoke Kinks shows since 1996." ...|$|E
500|$|Rehman {{signed a}} two-year deal with Bradford City on 19 June, saying of the move, [...] "My gut feeling {{told me to}} sign for Bradford and I've {{absolutely}} no regrets.

[...] The Bradford manager, Stuart McCall also revealed that Rehman had taken a large pay cut by joining the club, adding, [...] "Zesh is certainly not signing for Bradford for money—he wants to be a success here, and it will <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> have him on board."

500|$|The {{introduction}} of Harmony and Sugar garnered critical praise. VanDerWerff {{wrote that the}} former [...] "may be the best new character ever", TVLine Michael Slezak said she was [...] "brillantly brought to life" [...] by Pearce, and Fallon felt that her arrival boded well for the introductions of the other finalists from The Glee Project. He said that [...] "she brought, which the best new characters do, fresh and exciting aspects in the show's established leads. Zoller Seitz described Sugar as [...] "an entitled little snot", but a [...] "great character" [...] nonetheless, and one he hoped to see more of. West praised Lengies' performance and opined that with Sue otherwise occupied, [...] "it'll <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> have another person as a thorn in the Glee club's side." [...] Not everyone was thrilled with Sugar's advent, however; VanDerWerff called the character [...] "awful".|$|E
500|$|Sue Crawford of the Daily Mirror said, [...] "playing a ladies' {{man comes}} {{naturally}} to Nigel Havers so it's hardly surprising he's playing a flirt in Coronation Street." [...] Crawford's colleague, Simon Boyle, wrote that Lewis was [...] "charming but devious." [...] Havers' {{role in the}} soap proved popular with female viewers. The actor told entertainment website Digital Spy {{that he had been}} sent sackfuls of fan mail and underwear. However, other viewers were unhappy with Havers' character's treatment of Audrey and the actor received abuse in the street. In November 2011, Jon Horsley of Yahoo! said viewers should be excited about Lewis' return to Coronation Street. Horsely added [...] "It'll <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> see the old smoothy back on the cobbles. We're really looking forward to Audrey's reaction to him, too." [...] Lewis' return to Coronation Street was selected for Digital Spy's Picture of the Day feature.|$|E
500|$|Fox {{stated that}} if Planet of the Apes was a {{financial}} success, then a sequel would be commissioned. Although {{the film was}} indeed a financial success, Fox decided not to proceed with a sequel. When asked whether he {{would be interested in}} working on a follow-up, director Tim Burton replied, [...] "I'd rather jump out a window." [...] Mark Wahlberg and Helena Bonham Carter would have returned if Burton had decided to make another Apes film. Paul Giamatti had been interested in reprising his role. [...] "I think it'd <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> have apes driving cars, smoking cigars," [...] Giamatti said. [...] "Wearing glasses, sitting in a board room, stuff like that." [...] Planet of the Apes was the last film Burton worked on with his former fiancée Lisa Marie. After their relationship broke up, Burton started a relationship with Bonham Carter, who portrayed Ari. Planet of the Apes was also Burton's first collaboration with producer Richard D. Zanuck.|$|E

500|$|Attanasio based the {{characters}} in Homicide on the detectives featured in Simon's book. Frank Pembleton was based on Detective Harry Edgerton, although the two were so different that both the producers and detectives agreed their only true similarity {{was that they were}} black. Meldrick Lewis was only loosely based on Detective Donald Waltemeyer, and Levinson admitted Lewis did not start to become strongly developed until [...] because, [...] "I thought it'd <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> have a character who was totally unwilling to share with the people he worked with." [...] Tim Bayliss was based on the real-life Baltimore detective Tom Pellegrini, the primary detective who investigated the 1988 Baltimore slaying of 11-year-old Latonya Kim Wallace. The extremely personal approach Bayliss took in attempting to solve Adena Watson's murder, and his strong disappointment over failing to solve it, was based on the emotions Pellegrini went through in the Wallace case. Pellegrini provided advice to actor Kyle Secor about how to play the Bayliss role.|$|E

[...] It's bad enough that you people get all the parking spots!" [...] To an individual with Tourette syndrome, she says, [...] "I think Tourettes is so cool. It would <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> be able to annoy people like that. You get to whoop and twitch. Any other good ones?" [...] A passing blind man accidentally taps her with his cane, and Ling cries, [...] "OW! [...] They're not weapons!...I so prefer the deaf to the blind." [...] Ling will even impersonate the blind to get her way. In one episode she puts on sunglasses, extends a telescoping white cane, and walks across a busy street, [...] tires squealing as she hits a couple of cars with her cane. [...] Ling is unapologetic for these affronts. When pointed out that [...] "there are real blind people in the world", Ling retorts, [...] "It's not like any of them saw me." ...|$|E
500|$|Underwood {{was created}} to give Carter a [...] "strong female antagonist", and Butters noted that [...] "we said, wouldn’t it <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> {{have one of those}} people who is living right there with her be {{actually}} a bad guy?" [...] In late January 2015, Butters and Fazekas revealed that Underwood is a product of the precursor to the Black Widow program. Regan did not know the character was a Black Widow when auditioning, but quickly learned after being cast, as the showrunners wanted her to change her then current red hair, in order to avoid being [...] "a tip to the audience, because of Natasha [...] They didn’t want to imply that every Black Widow had red hair and they didn’t want the audience to see it coming." [...] Regan trained with a Tae Kwan Do expert and studied Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow choreography from the films in preparation for the character's fight scenes, while Ottobre-Melton referenced her Black Widow status by using the colors red and black. Underwood's initial [...] "small-town girl from Iowa" [...] persona was based on Judy Garland's Dorothy Gale from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E

500|$|Vig {{recalled}} that the title [...] "Not Your Kind of People" [...] {{came to him}} when he was stuck in a traffic jam in Los Angeles; he texted Manson the idea for a title and she loved it. Manson wrote all the lyrics that night, and the next day the four of them gathered with acoustic guitars and wrote the music to the song in about half an hour. Manson explained that the album title Not Your Kind of People was [...] "a call to arms in a way to anyone who feels like we do about the world", saying that [...] "it can <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> be outsider." [...] She felt that this applied to them as the band [...] "never fit into a music scene" [...] and that [...] "in my life I've never been an insider." [...] Manson also described the title as [...] "a two-fingered salute to people who reject or criticize us", stating the band was [...] "only really interested in people who share our outlook" [...] as she considered that their fans were [...] "the people who connect with what you're saying and how you say it." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{gave the}} games a 9/10, a higher rating {{than any of}} the other Nintendo DS Pokémon games. The review praised the games for {{renewing}} interest in the series, though criticized some of the new Pokémon designs, explaining that [...] "aside from a weaker lineup of monsters (largely an aesthetic complaint), this is the best Pokémon has to offer on every level, renewing my waning interest in monster battling". Jeremy Parish of Retronauts criticized Black and White, commenting that he grew tired of it shortly after starting and feeling like it was too similar to all previous Pokémon games. He further went on to say that EVs and IVs, invisible mechanics in the game, are not necessarily beneficial. By contrast, he noted that it would <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> new players. He also compared it to the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games and Final Fantasy XIII, arguing that they all share the common element of being bad before they get good. Fellow Retronauts contributor Justin Haywald criticized the games' release on the DS, which had received two main Pokémon series games published before them. GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson stated [...] "It may not break the Pokemon mold, but Black/White offers enough new content coupled with the series' classic, deep battle mechanics to make it endlessly playable. If you could only play one game for the rest of your life, this would be a wise choice." ...|$|E
500|$|Sigourney Weaver has {{expressed}} interest in reuniting with Ridley Scott to revive her character for another Alien film. In the 2003 commentary track for the Alien DVD included in the Alien Quadrilogy set, she and Scott both speculated on the possibility, with Weaver stating: [...] "There is an appetite for a fifth one, which is something I never expected...it's really hard {{to come up with}} a fifth story that's new and fresh...but I have wanted to go back into space...I think outer space adventure is a good thing for us right now, 'cause Earth is so grim...so we've been talking about it, but very generally." [...] Scott remarked that, if the series were to continue, the most logical course would be to explore the origins of the space jockey and the Aliens. Weaver supported this idea, saying [...] "I think it would <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> go back, because I'm asked that question so many times: 'Where did the Alien come from?' People really want to know in a very visceral way." [...] David Giler said that he, Walter Hill, and Gordon Carroll, the producers of the first four films in the series, would not be willing to produce another unless it was about the Aliens' homeworld and Weaver was on board (despite the fact that they were among the producers of Alien vs. Predator films). Weaver, in turn, indicated that she would only return to the franchise if either Scott or James Cameron were to direct. Cameron had been working on a story for a fifth Alien film which would explore the origins of the creatures, but ceased work on it when he learned that Fox was pursuing Alien vs. Predator, which he felt would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise".|$|E
