5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> of the cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E
5|$|The trams are bidirectional, with a driver's cab at each end. These cabs {{are built}} so the {{motorman}} can also sell tickets. The cab's have {{a door to}} close them off, so the riders cannot access rear cab. There are four doors on both sides; the front door is single while the three <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> are double. In addition to the front door, there is one door in each section. To operate the doors on the left side, the motorman must engage a security switch. It is also possible to open each individual door {{on the right side}} from the driver's cab. Half the length is low-floor, with an entry height at , including three of the four doors. There are 88 seats, of which 64 are on the high-floor section, giving a total capacity of 212 riders.|$|E

25|$|While many fairies will confuse {{travelers}} on the path, {{the will}} o' the wisp {{can be avoided}} by not following it. Certain locations, known to be haunts of fairies, are to be avoided; C. S. Lewis reported hearing of a cottage more feared for its reported fairies than its reported ghost. In particular, digging in fairy hills was unwise. Paths that the fairies travel are also wise to avoid. Home-owners have knocked corners from houses because the corner blocked the fairy path, and cottages have been built with the front and <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> in line, so that the owners could, in need, leave them both open and let the fairies troop through all night. Locations such as fairy forts were left undisturbed; even cutting brush on fairy forts was reputed to be the death of those who performed the act. Fairy trees, such as thorn trees, were dangerous to chop down; one such tree was left alone in Scotland, though it prevented a road being widened for seventy years.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, George Street was added, {{and soon}} after Walford East tube station was built, to create further {{locations}} when EastEnders went from two to three episodes per week. The set was constructed by the BBC in-house construction department under construction manager Mike Hagan. The initial build took six months to complete. Most of the buildings on Albert Square have no interior filming space, with a few exceptions, and most do not have rears or gardens. Most areas by the front (and sometimes <b>back)</b> <b>doors</b> are decorated and dressed to match the interior set to allow shots of doors being opened. The grocery shop was originally open fronted, it {{was turned into a}} closed front shop, with removable interior walls to allow for filming inside the shop when the set was expanded in 1987. Some interior shots are filmed in the actual buildings, and the café also has some interior decoration so some limited filming can take place by the door. The newer exterior sets including fish and chip shop, video shop and beauty salon had some interior filming space to create a greater sense of realism. As the show is filmed up to six weeks in advance, the trees need to have extra leaves stuck on them during the spring to make them look like they would in summer.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>back</b> <b>door</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} to be an exit pathway from the myosin active site for phosphate (Pi) generated by adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate hydrolysis. We used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interaction of Pi with the <b>back</b> <b>door</b> and the plausibility of Pi release via this route. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the Dictyostelium motor domain with bound Mg·adenosine 5 ′-diphosphate (ADP) and Pi, modeled upon the Mg·ADP·BeFx and Mg·ADP·Vi structures. Simulations revealed that the relaxation of ADP and free Pi from their initial positions reduced {{the diameter of the}} <b>back</b> <b>door</b> via motions of switch 1 and switch 2 located in the upper and lower 50 -kDa subdomains, respectively. In neither simulation could Pi freely diffuse out the <b>back</b> <b>door.</b> Water molecules, however, could flux through the <b>back</b> <b>door</b> in the Mg·ADP·BeFx-based simulation but not in the Mg·ADP·Vi-based simulation. In neither structure was water observed fluxing through the main (front door) entrance. These observations suggest that the ability of Pi to leave via the <b>back</b> <b>door</b> is linked tightly to conformational changes between the upper and lower 50 -kDa subdomains. The simulations offer structural explanations for 18 O-exchange with Pi at the active site, and Pi release being the rate-limiting step in the myosin adenosine 5 ′-triphosphatase...|$|R

500|$|Wired said Kaspersky's critics {{accuse him}} of using the company to spy on users for Russian intelligence. Russian {{telecommunications}} companies for example are required by federal law in Russia {{to cooperate with the}} government's military and spy operations if asked. Kaspersky said his company has never been asked to tamper with its software for espionage and called the accusations [...] "cold war paranoia." [...] According to Wired, Kaspersky staffers argue [...] "not unconvincingly" [...] that spying on users would hurt its business and its relationship with the Russian FSB, the KGB's successor, is limited. According to Gartner, [...] "There's no evidence that they have any <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> in their software or any ties to the Russian mafia or state... but there is still a concern that you can’t operate in Russia without being controlled by the ruling party.” Computing mocked some of the more extreme accusations of espionage, but said it would be unlikely for a Russian business to grow to the size of Kaspersky Lab without relationships within the Russian government. NPR journalists also said it was unlikely Kaspersky was using its software for espionage, because it would be risky for the company's business, but said Kaspersky showed an unusual disinterest in Russia-based cybercrime.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the middle}} of 2005, China {{purchased}} over 200 routers from an American company, Cisco Systems, which allowed the Chinese government a more advanced technological censoring ability. In February 2006, Google made a significant concession to the Great Firewall of China, in exchange for equipment installation on Chinese soil, by blocking websites which the Chinese government deemed illegal.

2500|$|Fairlington's {{streets are}} all two lanes {{and they are}} neither on a grid with uniform city blocks nor in the {{suburban}} cul-de-sac style found in most American suburbs but are slightly winding and usually separated by the equivalent {{of two or more}} city blocks. Fairlington's apartment units are grouped in [...] "courts," [...] usually three or four separate buildings of around 40-50 total units facing a parking lot (carpark). Most units are three levels (upstairs, ground level and basement) with front and <b>back</b> <b>doors.</b> Some units are two or three story walk-ups with units on a single floor. Prior to the condominium conversions, <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> opened to common areas with connecting sidewalks leading to back porches. Post-conversions, most units have a small courtyard off the back door, surrounded by a wooden fence. The common areas between the courts contain open areas for recreation. Originally the common areas included playgrounds and wading pools. The latter consisted of flat concrete squares with short concrete sides and a sprinkler in the center. These provided cooling and recreation in the summer when air conditioning was not widely available. With the conversion to condominiums, tennis, basketball courts, playgrounds, and swimming facilities replaced the original playgrounds and wading pools. Prior to the condominium conversions, each building had a common basement area, which could be reached from the basement of apartments which had basements, or from a stairway in buildings containing single-floor apartments. The common basement contained trashrooms and laundry facilities. Buildings with single-floor apartments also had storage units in the common basements. With the condominium conversions, the common areas were divided {{to become part of the}} basement areas of individual condominiums. [...] Sidewalks (pavements) along the streets and in the common areas connect the neighborhood. Each condominium association in South Fairlington consists of around 15 courts.|$|E
