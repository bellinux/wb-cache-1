5|$|Geysers are fragile {{phenomena}} and if conditions change, they may go dormant or extinct. Many {{have been destroyed}} simply <b>by</b> <b>people</b> throwing debris into them while others have ceased to erupt due to dewatering by geothermal power plants. However, the Great Geysir of Iceland has had periods of activity and dormancy. During its long dormant periods, eruptions were sometimes artificially induced—often on special occasions—by the addition of surfactants to the water.|$|E
