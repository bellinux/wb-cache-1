5|$|Sedimentological {{data from}} the Mussentuchit Member {{indicates}} that Eolambia lived on a poorly-drained floodplain, around a system of large, perennial lakes. The lakes fluctuated <b>between</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> low water levels in Milankovitch cycles of roughly 21,000 years, caused by the Earth's axial precession. These cycles is reflected by the alternating layers of muddy sandstone and mudstone in present-day rock deposits. During dry periods, the exposed lakebed formed a broad beach devoid of plants. The cracked mud of the lakebed produced mud clasts, while organic debris and scavenged carcasses were scattered around the water's edge as the lake progressively retreated. Meanwhile, during periods in which the sea level rose, small rivers invaded the floodplain, which reworked and displaced the debris that had been deposited during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of National Education is {{responsible}} for pre-tertiary education. This is compulsory and lasts twelve years: four years each of primary school, {{middle school and high}} school. Less than half of 25- to 34-year-old Turks have completed at least high school, compared with an OECD average of over 80 percent. Basic education in Turkey is considered to lag behind other OECD countries, with significant differences <b>between</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> low performers. Turkey is ranked 32nd out of 34 in the OECD's PISA study. Access to high-quality school heavily depends on the performance in the secondary school entrance exams, to the point that some students begin taking private tutoring classes when they are 10 years old. The overall adult literacy rate in 2011 was 94.1 percent; 97.9 percent for males and 90.3 percent for females.|$|E
5|$|To ensure {{constant}} air support, Jagdgeschwader (Fighter Wings) and Nachtjagdgeschwader (Night Fighter Wings) in {{the shape}} of Nachtjagdgeschwader 1, were ordered to achieve a frantic pace in servicing and preparing aircraft for their next mission. To keep a constant aerial vigil over the task force, the 'black men' (mechanics) had to complete rearming and refuelling in 30 minutes or less. Galland insisted that the air units aircraft should be split <b>between</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> low altitude to provide sound cover. The low altitude groups would be able to evade detection by British coastal radar. Galland demanded an umbrella of at least 16 fighters over the ships at any one time along the whole length of the channel. The fighter group would be split into two groups of eight aircraft for their respective patrol altitudes. Each formation was split into two Schwärme of four aircraft. The Schwärme tactics involved one formation flying to sea and one to land in a zigzag pattern. All Schwärme were ordered to fly back and forth along the line of ships in wide figures of eight while maintaining radio silence. Every sortie was meticulously timed to allow the fighters exactly 30 minutes over the ships, enough to maintain cover and allow the relieved units to refuel and rearm and return to start the cycle again. However, during Donnerkeil, the relieving sortie would arrive after only 20 minutes which meant the actual fighter cover for half the dash would be 32 fighters.|$|E

25|$|In polymerization, both {{gas phase}} and surface {{reactions}} occur, but mechanism differs <b>between</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> low frequencies. At high frequencies {{it occurs in}} reactive intermediates, whereas at low frequencies polymerization happens mainly on surfaces. As polymerization occurs, the pressure inside the chamber decreases in a closed system, since gas phase monomers go to solid polymers. An example diagram {{of the ways that}} polymerization can take place is shown in Figure 2, wherein the most abundant pathway is shown in blue with double arrows, with side pathways shown in black. The ablation occurs by gas formation during polymerization. Polymerization has two pathways, either the plasma state or plasma induced processes, which both lead to deposited polymer.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a big}} gap {{among various}} {{countries}} <b>between</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> low yields, even with the same variety of potato. Average potato yields in developed economies ranges between 38–44 tonnes per hectare. China and India accounted for {{over a third of}} world's production in 2010, and had yields of 14.7 and 19.9 tonnes per hectare respectively. The yield gap between farms in developing economies and developed economies represents an opportunity loss of over 400 million tonnes of potato, or an amount greater than 2010 world potato production. Potato crop yields are determined by factors such as the crop breed, seed age and quality, crop management practices and the plant environment. Improvements in {{one or more of these}} yield determinants, and a closure of the yield gap, can be a major boost to food supply and farmer incomes in the developing world.|$|E
25|$|Many {{difficulties}} {{occurred in}} driving the piles which considerably retarded {{the progress of}} the work, and, among others, the peculiar effect of ebb and flow during this operation is worthy of note. At flood-tide the sand became so hard as almost totally to resist the utmost efforts of driving, while at ebb the sand was quite loose, and allowed of doing so with facility. It was therefore found necessary to abandon the driving on many occasions during high water. The difference <b>between</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> low water is 11 feet 6 inches. Another difficulty arose from the quicksands beneath the foundations. Although the piles were driven to the rock bottom, the water forced its way up, baffling the attempts to fill in between them; this, however, was remedied by using a concrete made of broken stone and Roman cement, which was continually thrown in until the bottom was found to be secure.|$|E

25|$|On 20 July 1942, when Rommel {{was driving}} towards Egypt, General Headquarters (GHQ) ordered the {{construction}} of two bridges across the Nile to allow Eighth Army's armour to manoeuvre to the south if the Cairo defences were attacked. The task was assigned to X CTRE under Lt-Col E.N. Bickford. The sites chosen were at Helwan and Wasta, where the widths to be bridged were 2688 feet (820m) and 2760 feet (840m) respectively, and the difference <b>between</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> low water was about 22 feet (7m). Pontoons were unavailable, so local feluccas were {{used to make a}} bridge of boats. 572nd Field Company took on the bridge at Helwan with the assistance of a Seychelles Pioneer Company, while 571st Field Company with a Mauritius Pioneer Company built the Wasta bridge. 570th Field Park Company was responsible for stores and welding. In the event, Rommel's final drive was halted at the Battle of Alam Halfa, the Cairo defences were not required, and the bridges were dismantled in November.|$|E
25|$|Internally fertilized eggs {{develop in}} the polyp for a period ranging from days to weeks. Subsequent {{development}} produces a tiny larva, known as a planula. Externally fertilized eggs develop during synchronized spawning. Polyps release eggs and sperm into the water en masse, simultaneously. Eggs disperse over a large area. The timing of spawning depends on time of year, water temperature, and tidal and lunar cycles. Spawning is most successful when there is little variation <b>between</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> low tide. The less water movement, the better the chance for fertilization. Ideal timing occurs in the spring. Release of eggs or planula usually occurs at night, and is sometimes in phase with the lunar cycle (three to six days after a full moon). The period from release to settlement lasts only a few days, but some planulae can survive afloat for several weeks. They are vulnerable to predation and environmental conditions. The lucky few planulae which successfully attach to substrate next confront competition for food and space.|$|E

[...] The effect of the Velvet Underground gave rock musicians like Iggy Pop of the Stooges a self-consciousness about their work.

In the 1970s, a similarly self-conscious art/pop community (which Frith calls [...] "the most significant" [...] of the period) began to coalesce in the Mercer Arts Center in New York.
