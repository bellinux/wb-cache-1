50|$|Building {{information}} modeling (<b>BIM)</b> <b>is</b> {{the logical}} development of CAD drawing, {{a relatively new}} technology but fast becoming mainstream. The design team collaborates to create a three-dimensional computer model, and all plans and other two-dimensional views are generated directly from the model, ensuring spatial consistency. The key innovation here is to share the model via the internet, {{so that all the}} design functions (site survey, architecture, structure and services) can be integrated into a single model, or as a series of models associated with each specialism that are shared throughout the design development process. Some form of management, not necessarily by the architect, needs to be in place to resolve conflicting priorities. The starting point of <b>BIM</b> <b>is</b> spatial design, but it also enables components to be quantified and scheduled directly from the information embedded in the model.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the changes in}} the expression of microRNA- 181 a (miR- 181 a) and Bim in a rat model of retinal ischemia-reperfusion (RIR), to explore their target relationship in RIR and their involvement in regulating apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). METHODS: Target gene prediction for miR- 181 a was performed with the aid of bioinformatics and <b>Bim</b> <b>was</b> identified as a potential target gene of miR- 181 a. A rat model of RIR was created by increasing the intraocular pressure. RGCs in the flatmounted retinas were labeled with Brn 3, a marker for alive RGCs, by immunofluorescent staining. The changes in the number of RGCs after RIR were recorded. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to determine the expression level of miR- 181 a in the retina. Bim/Brn 3 double immunofluorescence was used to detect the localization of Bim. The expression of Bim in the retina was determined with the aids of Western blot and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Compared with the negative control group, the density of RGCs was significantly lower in the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) - 24 h and I/R- 72 h groups (P< 0. 001). The expression level of miR- 181 a started to decrease at 0 h after RIR, and further decreased at 24 h and 72 h compared with the negative control group (P< 0. 001). <b>Bim</b> <b>was</b> significantly upregulated at 12 h after RIR (P< 0. 05) and reached peak at 24, 72 h compared with the negative control group (P< 0. 01). Pearson correlation analysis showed that the expression level of <b>Bim</b> <b>was</b> negatively correlated with the expression level of miR- 181 a and the density of RGCs. CONCLUSION: <b>Bim</b> may <b>be</b> a potential target gene of miR- 181 a. Both miR- 181 a and <b>Bim</b> <b>are</b> involved in RGCs death in RIR. RIR may promote RGCs apoptosis in the retina via downregulation of miR- 181 a and its inhibition on Bim expression...|$|R
