40|$|Sliding {{friction}} {{experiments were}} conducted with iron, copper, and aluminum in contact with iron {{in various states of}} strain. The surfaces were examined in dry sliding and with various benzyl compounds applied as lubricants. Friction experiments {{were conducted with}} a hemispherical rider contacting a flat disk at loads of from 50 to 600 grams with a sliding speed of 0. 15 cm/min. Results indicate that straining increases friction for dry sliding and for surfaces lubricated with certain benzyl structures such as dibenzyl disulfide. With other benzyl compounds (e. g., <b>benzyl</b> <b>formate),</b> friction coefficients are lower for strained than for annealed iron...|$|E
40|$|The {{fragmentation}} {{mechanism of}} ionized neopentanol, (CH 3) 3 CCH 2 OH+-, {{has been studied}} in great detail along with other C 5 H H+- isomers. The use of C and D labelling was found an essential tool to establish {{the relation between the}} other species involved in the dissociation of neopentanol. The involvement of (CH 3) 2 C·CH 2 +(O) HCH 3, (CH 3) 3 C+(O) HCH 2 and (CH 3) 2 (·CH 2) CCH 2 +OH 2 was essential to explain the H/D label exchange occurring upon fragmentation of neopentyl alcohol. An ion-dipole complex between methanol and ionized methyl propene is proposed as the final intermediate which leads directly to the products, methanol and ionized methyl propene. The results of the investigation of C 7 H 5 + ions from various precursor molecules are also described. The following compounds, which all produce C 7 H 5 + ions, were studied: benzyl acetate, <b>benzyl</b> <b>formate,</b> benzyl alcohol, 2 -bromocyclopropabenzene, 1, 6 -heptadiyne and 1, 5 -decadiyne. According to the metastable ion (MI) mass spectra and the He collision induced dissociation (CID) of m/z 89 ions, it is suggested that four structures exist. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{participation}} of distinct formate dehydrogenases and cytochrome components in nitrate reduction by Escherichia coli was studied. The formate dehydrogenase activity present in extracts prepared from nitrate-induced cells of strain HfrH was active with various electron acceptors, including methylene blue, phenazine methosulfate, and benzyl viologen. Certain mutants which {{are unable to}} reduce nitrate had low or undetectable levels of formate dehydrogenase activity assayed with methylene blue or phenazine methosulfate as electron acceptor. Of nine such mutants, five produced gas when grown anaerobically without nitrate and possessed a <b>benzyl</b> viologen-linked <b>formate</b> dehydrogenase activity, suggesting that distinct formate dehydrogenases participate in the nitrate reductase and formic hydrogenlyase systems. The other four mutants formed little gas when grown anaerobically {{in the absence of}} nitrate and lacked the <b>benzyl</b> viologen-linked <b>formate</b> dehydrogenase as well as the methylene blue or phenazine methosulfate-linked activity. The cytochrome b 1 present in nitrate-induced cells was distinguished by its spectral properties and its genetic control from the major cytochrome b 1 components of aerobic cells and of cells grown anaerobically in the absence of nitrate. The nitrate-specific cytochrome b 1 was completely and rapidly reduced by 1 mm formate but was not reduced by 1 mm reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; ascorbate reduced only part of the cytochrome b 1 which was reduced by formate. When nitrate was added, the formate-reduced cytochrome b 1 was oxidized with biphasic kinetics, but the ascorbate-reduced cytochrome b 1 was oxidized with monophasic kinetics. The inhibitory effects of n-heptyl hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide on the oxidation of cytochrome b 1 by nitrate provided evidence that the nitrate-specific cytochrome is composed of two components which have different redox potentials but identical spectral properties. We conclude from these studies that nitrate reduction in E. coli is mediated by the sequential operation of a specific formate dehydrogenase, two specific cytochrome b 1 components, and nitrate reductase...|$|R
40|$|The {{strictly}} anaerobic archaeon Thermococcus strain ES- 1 {{was recently}} isolated from near a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. It grows at temperatures up to 91 degrees C by the fermentation of peptides and reduces elemental sulfur (S(o)) to H 2 S. It is shown {{here that the}} growth rates and cell yields of strain ES- 1 are dependent upon the concentration of S(o) in the medium, and no growth was observed {{in the absence of}} S(o). The activities of various catabolic enzymes in cells grown under conditions of sufficient and limiting S(o) concentrations were investigated. These enzymes included alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH); <b>formate</b> <b>benzyl</b> viologen oxidoreductase; hydrogenase; glutamate dehydrogenase; alanine dehydrogenase; aldehyde ferredoxin (Fd) oxidoreductase; formaldehyde Fd oxidoreductase; and coenzyme A-dependent, Fd-linked oxidoreductases specific for pyruvate, indolepyruvate, 2 -ketoglutarate, and 2 -ketoisovalerate. Of these, changes were observed only with ADH, <b>formate</b> <b>benzyl</b> viologen oxidoreductase, and hydrogenase, the specific activities of which all dramatically increased in cells grown under S(o) limitation. This was accompanied by increased amounts of H 2 and alcohol (ethanol and butanol) from cultures grown with limiting S(o). Such cells were used to purify ADH to electrophoretic homogeneity. ADH is a homotetramer with a subunit M(r) of 46, 000 and contains 1 g-atom of Fe per subunit, which, as determined by electron paramagnetic resonance analyses, is present as a mixture of ferrous and ferric forms. No other metals or acid-labile sulfide was detected by colorimetric and elemental analyses. ADH utilized NADP(H) as a cofactor and preferentially catalyzed aldehyde reduction. It is proposed that, under So limitation, ADH reduces to alcohols the aldehydes that are generated by fermentation, thereby serving to dispose of excess reductant...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages [49]- 51. It {{has been}} found that Ersteus mirabilis and Escherichia gali can use {{dimethylsulfoxide}} (DMSO) as an electron acceptor for anaerobic growth. During growth, DMSO was reduced to dimethylsulfide (DMS) as determined by gas chromatography. During a survey of carbon sources capable of supporting DMSO dependent respiration in E. * mirabilis. it was found that fermentable substrates such as glucose and pyruvate as well as oxidizable substrates such as glycerol and lactate are capable of supporting DMSO respiration. In addition, in a complex medium formate greatly stimulates growth in the presence of DMSO. When cell extracts were assayed for DMSO reduction, it was found that NADH, reduced methyl viologen, reduced <b>benzyl</b> viologen, <b>formate,</b> and lactate can serve as electron donors, whereas NADPH is a very poor donor. Chlorate resistant mutants were isolated and were found to be unable to use DMSO as an electron acceptor. These mutants can be divided into at least two groups. In the first group, growth and DMSO reduction can be restored by a high concentration of molybdate in the medium, whereas in the second group, growth and DMSO reduction cannot be restored. DMSO supports anaerobic growth of £. coli on glycerol and slightly enhances growth on glucose. When cell extracts were assayed for DMSO reduction it was found that NADH, formate, lactate, reduced methyl viologen, and reduced benzyl viologen can serve as electron donors while NADPH is a very poor donor. When chlorate resistant mutants (chi) of E. coli. chlA. chlB. chlD. and chlE were tested, they were unable to grow using DMSO as an electron acceptor. However, {{in the case of the}} chlD mutant, growth and DMSO reduction could be restored by a high concentration of molybdate. Thus it appears that molybdenum cofactor is involved in DMSO reduction. Similarly, mutants of E. coli blocked in menaquinone (vitamin-Kg) biosynthesis (men), menB and menC were tested and were unable to grow utilizing DMSO as an electron acceptor. Growth and DMSO reduction can be restored to these mutants by the addition of either &-succinylbenzoic acid or 1, 4 -dihydroxy- 2 - napthoic acid depending on the metabolic block of the mutants. These results establish that menaquinone is involved in DMSO reduction. A comparison of the DMSO reductase activity of E. coli and £. mirahills under various growth conditions has led to the conclusion that Proteus is significantly more efficient than E. coli at gaining energy for growth from the reduction of DMSO.
