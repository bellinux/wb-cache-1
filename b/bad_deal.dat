A {{portion of the}} bulk fuel storage facilities was transferred {{by the federal government}} to the Commonwealth of Virginia for use during the domestic fuel crisis periods of the 1970s.

A portion of the former Penniman site was transferred to the National Park Service in 1979 and was added to the Colonial National Historical Park.

500|$|The European Union and the United States as well {{as other}} western {{countries}} remain critical of the Eurasian Economic Union, with analysts stating that without modernisation and real economic reforms, the union will have little impact. The popular magazine The Economist stated that the advantages of joining the union remain unclear and further remarked [...] "The agreement was vague, with technical details left unresolved, making it a political show rather than an economic one". Outlets have also stated that without Ukraine, the Eurasian Economic Union has lost a key member state necessary {{to the success of the}} union. Bloomberg's business magazine, Businessweek has affirmed that joining Putin's Eurasian Union looks like a <b>bad</b> <b>deal,</b> including for Russia. The union [...] "won't really register on the radar of the global economy," [...] said an analyst at the EU's Institute for Security Studies in Paris.|$|E

This paper offers a new account of the evidence, based on the assumptions that individuals are affected by good and <b>bad</b> <b>deals</b> relative to the expected transaction price (price sensitivity), with <b>bad</b> <b>deals</b> having a larger impact on their utility ('bad-deal'aversion). These features of preferences explain the existing evidence better than alternative approaches, including the most recent developments of loss aversion models...|$|R

500|$|The word [...] "Eggtown" [...] is not {{directly}} referenced in the episode, resulting in online speculation and confusion. [...] According to Lindelof and Cuse, it has been [...] "the most questioned title of the show". [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly suggested that the title was {{a reference to the}} ancient cosmic egg concept or the chicken or the egg causality dilemma, while John Kubicek of BuddyTV guessed that it was a shout-out to the children's book and film called The Easter Egg Adventure, which depicts roosters attempting to steal Easter eggs from the animals of a place called Egg Town or that it was an allusion to the Great Depression slang term, which was used in the 1930s when describing a <b>bad</b> <b>deal.</b> [...] Lindelof and Cuse confirmed that the episode was primarily named as such because Locke fries eggs for Ben's breakfast and secondarily because the story deals with Kate's possible pregnancy.|$|E
500|$|The SmartBike DC bike sharing service, a {{predecessor}} to Capital Bikeshare, {{debuted in}} 2008 with 10 stations and 120 bicycles. It {{was the first}} of its kind in the United States. D.C. Department of Transportation Director Gabe Klein came into office four months later and he eager to expand it, but found the private partner had a [...] "lackluster commitment." [...] Because the agreement specifically prohibited DDOT from paying for anything related to SmartBike, an expansion required DDOT to renegotiate the contract. But in his first meeting with Clear Channel he found that Clear Channel believed they had gotten a <b>bad</b> <b>deal</b> on the original contract that created SmartBike; that following their purchase by Bain Capital they were no longer interested in [...] "municipal street furniture" [...] and that they had neither desire nor obligation to expand the program. In addition, it was difficult and expensive to install new stations, because they required the local utility company to bring electricity to each station. As a result, Klein chose to end the program and instead work with Arlington County, Virginia, to build a new, regional bikesharing program to be called Capital Bikeshare.|$|E

If someone is saying 'What am I going to buy this month?' in November, I hope that our game is the one they pick out, because we're offering something that nothing else on the market is. But if they don't, I totally understand. There's a lot of really cool stuff. What I'm hoping is that as time goes on... These things are still {{going to be on the}} shelf, it's not like we're taking it away. Maybe they don't buy it day one, but maybe they buy it in February? Maybe they buy it in March?

2500|$|May's public reticence {{during the}} {{referendum}} campaign resulted in tensions with David Cameron and his pro-EU team. Following the referendum and her election as party leader, May signalled {{that she would}} support full withdrawal from the EU and prioritise immigration controls over remaining within the single market, leading some to contrast this with her earlier remarks on the earlier economic arguments. She later {{went on to say}} before the 2017 UK general election that she would be willing to leave the EU without a deal, saying that [...] "no deal is better than a <b>bad</b> <b>deal.</b> We {{have to be prepared to}} walk out". The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said it was [...] "disappointing that Theresa May lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of Brexit. More disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge, she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self-harm on the UK economy by pulling Britain out of the single market." [...] Phil Wilson for the 'Open Britain' group said, [...] "It's good to know that privately Theresa May thinks what many of us have been saying publicly for a long time, leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy. Now she is prime minister, Theresa May is in an unrivalled position to act on her previous concerns, starting by putting membership of the single market at the heart of her government's negotiating position." ...|$|E
