5|$|Afternoon winds usually {{die down}} in the evening, {{prompting}} behavioral modifications in the herd. The deer avoid the dry wind by being more active at night when the wind is not <b>blowing.</b> <b>In</b> 1991 there was a three-year average of 420 mule deer.|$|E
5|$|The {{flags and}} pennants point to the low pressure, so it is {{possible}} to determine at which hemisphere the station is standing. The barbs in the figure at the right are located at the Northern Hemisphere, because the wind is circling counter clock-wise around a low-pressure area at the Northern Hemisphere (the wind is <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction at the Southern Hemisphere, see also Buys Ballot's law).|$|E

These images are accompanied by indistinct electronic buzzing and hissing sounds. The figure holds their right hand to the window, signaling with three fingers, then one, and finally two.|$|E
5|$|The Indian {{climate is}} {{strongly}} influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from <b>blowing</b> <b>in,</b> keeping {{the bulk of the}} Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.|$|E
5|$|Koji Sugimoto, main {{programmer}} for characters, {{said that}} {{the complexities of the}} PlayStation 2 hardware made mastering it difficult, but more rewarding because the details on Yuna's sleeves to the depiction of shine and shadow could be rendered more realistically. Final Fantasy X was the first game that allowed for 3-D model rendering of backgrounds that increased the presentation, including small details like grass <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> the wind and cloud movement. Takayoshi Nakazato decided to abandon the typical world map concept for a more realistic depiction. Final Fantasy Xs spatial presentation of Spira is tied to progression; with a player's progress being marked through the panoramic introduction and depiction of the area upon first entry. Chiharu Minekawa, the supervising sound editor, commented that the transition in sound from one environment to the next was done seamlessly in order to mimic the natural surroundings of these environments as the player moved through them.|$|E

5|$|Wales has a {{maritime}} climate, {{the predominant}} winds being southwesterlies and westerlies <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> from the Atlantic Ocean. This {{means that the}} weather in Wales is in general mild, cloudy, wet and windy. The country's wide geographic variations cause localised differences in amounts of sunshine, rainfall and temperature. Rainfall in Wales varies widely, with the highest average annual totals in Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons, and the lowest near the coast and in the east, close to the English border. Throughout Wales, the winter months are significantly wetter than the summer ones. Snow is comparatively rare near sea level in Wales, but much more frequent over the hills, and the uplands experience harsher conditions in winter than the more low-lying parts.|$|E

25|$|Winds are {{moderate}} and generally predictable, with monsoons usually <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> {{from the south}} and east in June through October and from the northwest in November through March. Typhoons and large scale storms pose little hazard to mariners in Indonesia waters; the major danger comes from swift currents in channels, such as the Lombok and Sape straits.|$|E
25|$|The theme {{may have}} been taken from a passage in Woody Guthrie's autobiography, Bound for Glory, in which Guthrie {{compared}} his political sensibility to newspapers <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> the winds of New York City streets and alleys. Dylan was certainly familiar with Guthrie's work; his reading of {{it had been a}} major turning point in his intellectual and political development.|$|E

25|$|The circle {{has been}} known since before the {{beginning}} of recorded history. Natural circles would have been observed, such as the Moon, Sun, and a short plant stalk <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> the wind on sand, which forms a circle shape in the sand. The circle is the basis for the wheel, which, with related inventions such as gears, makes much of modern machinery possible. In mathematics, the study of the circle has helped inspire the development of geometry, astronomy and calculus.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, the glassblowing {{technique}} reached Egypt and {{was described}} in a fragmentary poem printed on papyrus which was dated to 3rd century AD. The Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean areas resulted in the substitution of glassblowing for earlier Hellenistic casting, core-forming and mosaic fusion techniques. The earliest evidence of <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> Hellenistic work consists of small blown bottles for perfume and oil retrieved from the glass workshops on the Greek island of Samothrace and at Corinth in mainland Greece which were dated to the 1st century AD.|$|E
25|$|The trabucco {{is built}} with {{traditional}} wood Aleppo pine -the typical pine of Gargano and common throughout the South-Western Adriatic- because {{this material is}} virtually limitless (for his dissemination in the area) modeled, elastic, weatherproof and resistant to salt (trabucco must resist to strong Mistral usually <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> these areas). Some trabucchi have been rebuilt in recent years, thanks to public funds. However, since they lost their economic function in the past centuries when they were the main economical source of entire families of fishermen, trabucchi rose {{into the role of}} cultural and architectural symbols and tourist attraction.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{architecture}} {{had to be}} adapted to suit the extremes of the Mediterranean and desert climate. White and light colors reflected the heat. Walls not only provided privacy but protected against the sun. Large areas of glass that let in the light, {{a key element of}} the Bauhaus style in Europe, were replaced with small recessed windows that limited the heat and glare. Long narrow balconies, each shaded by the balcony above it, allowed residents to catch the breeze <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> from the sea to the west. Slanted roofs were replaced with flat ones, providing a common area where residents could socialize in the cool of the evening.|$|E
25|$|In Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, a {{tremendous}} firestorm developed within 20 minutes after detonation and destroyed many more buildings and homes, {{built out of}} predominantly 'flimsy' wooden materials. A firestorm has gale-force winds <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> towards {{the center of the}} fire from all points of the compass. It is not peculiar to nuclear explosions, having been observed frequently in large forest fires and following incendiary raids during World War II. Despite fires destroying a large area of the city of Nagasaki, no true firestorm occurred in the city, even though a higher yielding weapon was used. Many factors explain this seeming contradiction, including a different time of bombing than Hiroshima, terrain, and crucially, a lower fuel loading/fuel density in the city than that of Hiroshima.|$|E
25|$|Beebe {{windmill}} {{was built}} in 1820 at Sag Harbor for Lester Beebe. After his death, it was bought by Rose Gelston who had it moved to Bridgehampton where it worked for more than 50 years. In 1882, it was bought by James Sanford {{and moved to a}} site south of the railroad. Later, a steam engine was installed to provide power when the wind was not <b>blowing.</b> <b>In</b> 1888, the mill was repaired by millwright Nathaniel Dominy of Long Island. It was moved to a site north of the railroad in 1889. It was operated here until 1915 by the Bridgehampton Milling Company. In that year, it was bought by John E. Berwind and moved to his summer estate, Minden.|$|E
