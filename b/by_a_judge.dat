5|$|Several {{lawsuits}} {{have been}} filed against Yelp accusing it of extorting businesses into buying advertising products. Each have been dismissed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>judge</b> before reaching trial. In early 2010, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Yelp alleging it asked a Long Beach veterinary hospital to pay $300 a month for advertising services that included the suppression or deletion of disparaging customer reviews. The following month, nine additional businesses joined the class-action lawsuit, and two similar lawsuits were filed. That May the lawsuits were combined into one class-action lawsuit, which was dismissed by San Francisco U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in 2011. Chen said the reviews were protected by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 {{and that there was}} no evidence of manipulation by Yelp. The plaintiffs filed an appeal. In September 2014 the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, finding that even if Yelp did manipulate reviews to favor advertisers, this would not fall under the court's legal definition of extortion.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} in Pepper {{has been linked}} to a positive move in statutory interpretation that had been proceeding {{since the end of the}} Second World War. Previously, the dominant approach was that of the literal rule, supplemented by the golden and mischief rules (that interpretations should not be made if they were to lead to absurdity, and that interpretations should take into account the intention behind the statute). These approaches all limited the amount of material which could be used <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>judge</b> when interpreting the actions of Parliament. Following the 1969 Law Commission report The Interpretation of Statutes, British courts began to use a more purposive approach, which directed that when interpreting a statute they should examine the purpose behind it, rather than simply using the text of the statute itself. In effect, this widened the amount of material judges could use, including not only the statute but reports made by government bodies, the Law Commission and Royal Commissions. The impact of Pepper was to include Hansard in this list of acceptable material, not only to establish the overall purpose of an act but to define what was meant by a particular provision.|$|E
5|$|The {{format of}} the Super Quiz {{differs from that of}} the other subject areas. Added in 1969, it offers a {{culminating}} championship event. The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. The answer is checked on the spot <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>judge</b> and scores are immediately displayed to the audience.|$|E
5|$|Upon her {{arrest on}} November 22, 1995, Green {{was charged with}} two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of {{attempted}} first-degree murder, and one count of aggravated arson. She was held on $3,000,000 bail—the highest ever required {{at that point in}} time by Johnson County, Kansas—and maintained her innocence throughout pre-trial motions and a show cause hearing. However, when the defense's own investigators verified the strength of forensic evidence against Green, she agreed to an Alford plea to all charges. On May 30, 1996, she was sentenced to two concurrent forty-year prison sentences. Green has petitioned for a new trial twice since her conviction. Her first request, which she eventually withdrew, was based on a claim of having been rendered incompetent for plea bargaining by the psychiatric medications she was taking at the time of her hearings; her second, which was denied <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>judge,</b> claimed that the evidence used to convict her of arson had been rendered obsolete by scientific advances.|$|E

5|$|Homer, {{who still}} wants to party, rents an airboat and forces his family to come with him. He races through a swamp, accidentally killing the state's most famous {{resident}} and reptile – an alligator named Captain Jack, whom Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart saw on a tour earlier while Homer made a fool of himself at the concert. A sheriff quickly arrives {{on the scene and}} despite the fact that Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator. The family members flee from the sheriff and during a car chase they are hit by a train that pushes their car on the rail for several miles. When the Simpsons get off of the rail, they escape to a restaurant where they are given employment. They live in a nearby trailer and progressively turn into hillbillies. The sheriff eventually tracks them down and kidnaps them while they are sleeping. For their crimes (and Homer's foolish attempt at defending himself in court), the family is put into forced labor. One night when they are working at a party held <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>judge</b> in front of the capitol, tending to the guests (and failing to escape), Captain Jack strolls out of the capitol's doors. It turns out that he was never dead but rather knocked out. The family is acquitted, though they are banned from entering the state of Florida again (and several other states, excluding Arizona and North Dakota).|$|E
