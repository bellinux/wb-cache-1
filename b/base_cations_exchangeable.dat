40|$|Soil {{coarseness}} is {{the main}} process decreasing soil organic matter and threatening the productivity of sandy grasslands. Previous studies demonstrated negative effect of soil coarseness on soil carbon storage, but less is known about how soil <b>base</b> <b>cations</b> (<b>exchangeable</b> Ca, Mg, K, and Na) and available micronutrients (available Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn) response to soil coarseness. In a semi-arid grassland of Northern China, a field experiment was initiated in 2011 to mimic the effect of soil coarseness on soil base cations and available micronutrients by mixing soil with different mass proportions of sand: 0  % coarse elements (C 0), 10  % (C 10), 30  % (C 30), 50  % (C 50), and 70  % (C 70). Soil coarseness significantly increased soil pH in three soil depths of 0 – 10, 10 – 20 and 20 – 40  cm with the highest pH values detected in C 50 and C 70 treatments. Soil fine particles (smaller than 0. 25  mm) significantly decreased with the degree of soil coarseness. Exchangeable Ca and Mg concentrations significantly decreased with soil coarseness degree by up to 29. 8  % (in C 70) and 47. 5  % (in C 70), respectively, across three soil depths. Soil available Fe, Mn, and Cu significantly decreased with soil coarseness degree by 62. 5, 45. 4, and 44. 4  %, respectively. As affected by soil coarseness, the increase of soil pH, decrease of soil fine particles (including clay), and decline in soil organic matter were the main driving factors for the decrease of exchangeable base cations (except K) and available micronutrients (except Zn) through soil profile. Developed under soil coarseness, the loss and redistribution of base cations and available micronutrients along soil depths might {{pose a threat to}} ecosystem productivity of this sandy grassland...|$|E

The present study aimed to evaluate the soil particle-size and the chemical attributes of termite mounds and the surrounding soil under different land use strategies. A one-hectare plot was defined for an unmanaged degraded pasture, planted pasture, and for a eucalyptus Corymbia citriodora plantation. In each plot, the top, center, and base sections of five Cornitermes cumulans mounds, and the surrounding soil at the depths of 0 - 5; 5 - 10; 10 - 20 cm, were sampled in the Pinheiral, Rio de Janeiro state. In the three areas, {{the center of the}} mounds contained higher clay content, organic carbon, phosphorous, calcium and magnesium, total <b>bases,</b> and <b>cation</b> <b>exchangeable</b> capacity, when compared to the top, base, and the surrounding soils. However, the center had lower values of exchangeable acidity and potassium, of the three areas. In the eucalyptus plantation, the values of pH, total bases, calcium, and magnesium were lower, whereas aluminum, exchangeable acidity, sodium, and cation exchange capacity were higher both in the mounds and in the surrounding soil, in relation to the pastures. There were no differences among the three areas in terms of organic carbon, potassium, phosphorous, and total bases, in the mounds and adjacent soil. Thus, the termite activity altered the clay content and most of the soil chemical properties in all of the studied areas, but only for the center of the mounds.

The genetic horizon for 22 soil profiles were described for particle size and petrographic composition, quartz grain abrasion, transformation of organic substance, carbon and nitrogen characteristics, <b>base</b> saturation, <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations,</b> and acidity. The {{results showed that}} the morphogenesis of parent rock in all studied profiles is characterized by the glaciofluvial sedimentation of fine sands. All research plots were situated on valley terraces or outwash planes connected with glaciofluvial accumulation of redeposited, polygenetic sand formation. Soils belonged to three subtypes of Spodosols (podsolic class). All soil profiles were characterized by a very acid reaction (pH 3. 0 - 4. 5 in horizon A), and the degree of acidity corresponded to soil type. All other defined physico-chemical properties indicated that soils had low nutrient status. Mineral-humus layers of most of the soils were characterized by a high carbon:nitrogen ratio (from 10. 6 to 53. 7). This suggests limited biological activity of the soils and slow humification and mineralization rates. Overlying humus has three distinct subtypes (mor, moder/mor, mor/moder). In all soils the ratio of humic acids to fulvic acids was less than one, with the highest content of fulvic forms in humus compounds. Total <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations</b> averaged 2. 5 meq per 100 g of soil from the mineral-humus horizon and 0. 5 meq per 100 g of soil in the parent rock. The degree that the sorption complex was saturated with <b>base</b> <b>cations</b> was also very low (less than 10 percent).

40|$|The {{measurement}} of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations</b> in saline soils {{is limited by}} the difficulty in accurately separating soluble <b>cations</b> from <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations.</b> A method is examined for saline soils in which <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations</b> are calculated as the total extractable cations minus the concentration of soil solution (soluble) cations. In addition, a further two standard methods were investigated, one which assumes the total soil extractable <b>cations</b> are <b>exchangeable,</b> the other utilises a pretreatment to remove soluble salts prior to {{measurement of}} the remaining (<b>exchangeable)</b> <b>cations.</b> After equilibration with a range of sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) solutions at various ionic strengths, the <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations of two soils (Dermosol and Vertosol) were determined by these methods and compared to known values. The assumption that <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations</b> can be estimated as the total soil extractable cations, although valid at low ionic strength, resulted in an overestimation of exchangeable Na and Ca concentrations at higher ionic strengths due to the presence of soluble salts. Pretreatment with ethanol and glycerol was found to effectively remove soluble salts thus allowing the accurate measurement of the effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), however, dilution associated with the pretreatment process decreased concentrations of exchangeable Ca while simultaneously increasing exchangeable Na. Using the proposed method, good correlations were found between known and measured concentrations of exchangeable Na (Dermosol: y= 0. 873 x and Vertosol: y= 0. 960 x) and Ca (Dermosol: y= 0. 906 x, and Vertosol: y= 1. 05 x). Therefore, for soils with an ionic strength of approximately 50 mM (ECse 4 dS m- 1) or greater (in which <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations are overestimated by assuming the total soil <b>cations</b> are <b>exchangeable),</b> concentrations can be calculated as difference between total extractable cations and soluble cations...|$|R

The effect of a plow tillage (PT) and NT age chronosequence on SOC concentration and interactions with soil fertility were assessed in a variable charge Oxisol, located in the South Center quadrant of Parana State, Brazil (50 degrees 23 `W and 24 degrees 36 `S). The chronosequence consisted of the following six sites: (i) native field (NF); (ii) PT of the native field (PNF- 1) involving conversion of natural vegetation to cropland; (iii) NT for 10 years (NT- 10); (iv) NT for 20 years (NT- 20); (v) NT for 22 years (NT- 22); and (vi) conventional tillage for 22 years (CT- 22) involving PT with one disking after summer harvest and one after winter harvest to 20 cm depth plus two harrow disking. Soil samples were collected from five depths (0 - 2. 5; 2. 5 - 5; 5 - 10; 10 - 20; and 20 - 40 cm) and SOC, pH (in H(2) O and KCl), Delta pH, potential acidity, <b>exchangeable</b> <b>bases,</b> and <b>cation</b> <b>exchangeable</b> capacity (CEC) were measured. An increase in SOC concentration positively affected the pH, the negative charge and the CEC and negatively impacted potential acidity. Regression analyses indicated a close relationship between the SOC concentration and other parameters measured in this study. The regression fitted between SOC concentration and CEC showed a close relationship. There was an increase in negative charge and CEC with increase in SOC concentration: CEC increased by 0. 37 cmol(c) kg(- 1) for every g of C kg(- 1) soil. The ratio of ECEC:SOC was 0. 23 cmol(c) kg(- 1) for NF and increased to 0. 49 cmol(c) kg(- 1) for NT- 22. The rates of P and K for 0 - 10 cm depth increased by 9. 66 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1) and 17. 93 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1), respectively, with NF as a base line.

40|$|The {{effects of}} acid deposition, natural leaching, and {{harvesting}} on <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> export from forests in Maine, Tennessee, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Washington were compared. Based on previous literature, {{we hypothesized that}} <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> export via whole-tree harvesting (WTH) would be nearly independent of soil <b>exchangeable</b> <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> supplies; <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> export via leaching would be strongly dependent on the <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation</b> supplies {{as well as the}} input, production, and mobility of anions. This hypothesis was supported by the data: mixed deciduous sites in Tennessee had among the highest <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> (principally Ca) exports via WTH (1. 2 kmolc ha– 1 yr– 1), yet the lowest soil exchangeable supplies (35 kmolc ha– 1), whereas the Washington sites had by far the highest <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> leaching (5 – 41 kmolc ha– 1 yr– 1, due to very high levels of naturally produced HCO– 3) and soil exchangeable supplies, yet only relatively moderate <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> exports via WTH (0. 4 kmolc ha– 1 yr– 1). Sulfate was either the dominant or a major anion in soil solutions from the eastern sites, suggesting that atmospheric deposition was a major factor in soil leaching from these sites (0. 2 – 2. 1 kmolc ha– 1 yr– 1), but total leaching rates from these sites were much lower than at the Washington sites. Indeed, some of the eastern sites showed a net annual accumulation of one or more <b>base</b> <b>cations</b> from atmospheric deposition. Some of the southeastern sites with Ultisols showed the expected net retention of SO 2 – 4, but the sites in the Tennessee Valley near Oak Ridge showed surprisingly little ecosystem SO 2 – 4 retention, perhaps due to lower soil SO 2 – 4 adsorption in these soils than in other Ultisols...|$|R

Forest ¯oor solutions under Tsuga canadensis contained the most dissolved C and the most weak acidity among the six tree species. Under Tsuga canadensis we also found signi®cant amounts of strong acidity caused by deposition of sulphuric acid from the atmosphere and by strong organic acids. <b>Base</b> <b>cation</b> exchange was the most important mechanism by which acidity was neutralized.

The concentrations of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations</b> were then determined using several different types of methods, and the measured <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations compared to reference values. At low ionic strength (low salinity), the concentration of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations</b> can be accurately estimated from the total soil extractable cations. In saline soils, however, the presence of soluble salts in the soil solution precludes the use of this method. Leaching of the soil with a pre-wash solution (such as alcohol) was found to effectively remove the soluble salts from the soil, thus allowing the accurate measurement of the effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC). However, the dilution associated with this pre-washing increased the exchangeable Ca concentrations while simultaneously decreasing exchangeable Na. In contrast, when calculated as the difference between the total extractable cations and the soil solution cations, good correlations were found between the calculated <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations and the reference values for both Na (Mollisol: y= 0. 873 x and Vertisol: y= 0. 960 x) and Ca (Mollisol: y= 0. 901 x and Vertisol: y= 1. 05 x). Therefore, for soils with a soil solution ionic strength greater than 50 mM (electrical conductivity of 4 dS/m) (in which <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations are overestimated by the assumption they can be estimated as the total extractable cations), concentrations can be calculated as the difference between total extractable cations and soluble cations...|$|R
30|$|From the Table  1, {{it can be}} {{put forth}} that the CaI 1 values range from − 4.4 to 0.3 {{with a mean of}} − 1.1 and CaI 2 values vary from − 0.56 to 0.27 with a mean of − 0.25. From these values, it can be {{interpreted}} that most of the samples (95  %) in the studied area fall into negative zones. They indicate that the exchange of Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + of the water with Na and K in its host environment is prevalent in the studied area. The result suggests that <b>cation</b> <b>exchangeable</b> can also be one of the mechanisms responsible for the chemical composition of the groundwaters in the studied area.|$|R
40|$|A 20 -m-wide trench was {{excavated}} to bedrock on a hillslope at the Panola Mountain Research Watershed in the Piedmont {{region of}} Georgia {{to determine the}} effect of upslope drainage area from the soil and bedrock surfaces on the geochemical evolution of <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations in subsurface flow. Samples were collected from ten 2 -m sections and five natural soil pipes during three winter rainstorms in 1996. <b>Base</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations in hillslope subsurface flow were generally highest early and late in the storm response when flow rates were low, but during peak flow, concentrations varied little. <b>Base</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations in matrix flow from the 10 trench sections were unrelated to the soil surface drainage area and weakly inversely related to the bedrock surface drainage area. <b>Base</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations in pipe flow were lower than those in matrix flow and were also consistent with the inverse relation to bedrock surface drainage area found in matrix flow. The left side of the trench, which has the highest bedrock surface drainage area, had consistently lower mean <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations than {{the right side of the}} trench, which has the lowest bedrock surface drainage area. During moderate size rain events of about 20 – 40 mm, subsurface flow occurred only on the left side of the trench. The greater volume of water that has flowed through the left side of the trench appears to have resulted in greater leaching of <b>base</b> <b>cations</b> from soils and therefore lower <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations in subsurface flow than in flow from the right side of the trench. Alternatively, a greater proportion of flow that bypasses the soil matrix may have occurred through the hillslope on the left side of the trench than on the right side.

40|$|Hydrologic response, vegetation, {{nutrient}} cycling, {{and soil}} structure {{are some of}} the ecosystem properties affected when a watershed is strip-mined for coal and subsequently reclaimed. The present study sought to quantify the impacts of strip-mining and reclamation on the <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> pools and cycling within a watershed. To that end, a paired watershed study was conducted comparing a strip-mined watershed (TMat 1) to a second-growth forested watershed (TNef 1). <b>Base</b> <b>cation</b> input-output budgets were constructed for two watersheds using precipitation collection and stream sampling techniques. Soil <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> pools and cation exchange capacities were measured, and lysimeter samples were analyzed for calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium. In-stream silica concentrations were also measured to help discern whether <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> export was due to a silicate mineral weathering source or from the soil exchange complex. Although it was difficult to determine the source of <b>base</b> <b>cations,</b> TMat 1 was exporting vastly greater quantities of all four <b>base</b> <b>cations</b> than was TNef 1. Mineral soil exchangeable Ca, Mg, and Na were significantly greater at TMat 1, due to mining and exposure of mineral surfaces such as limestone and other bedrock. Mineral soil CEC was not significantly different between the two sites. Similarly, 15 cm deep lysimeters also had significantly higher levels of Ca, Mg, and Na at TMat 1 than TNef 1. From this research, it is clear that reclamation has not restored TMat 1 to its original condition {{and that there is a}} large amount of <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> export to the stream in this watershed. Prolonged cation export could cause long-term nutrient depletion, but could also serve to neutralize mineral acidity associated with acid mine drainage and acid rain at TMat 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{multi-layer}} {{dynamic model}} SAFE {{was applied to}} the forested catchment istebna (Southern Poland), to study recovery from acidification. Environmental pollution in the area has been historically high. The model uses data from an intensive monitoring plot established in 1999 in a spruce stand, which was planted in 1880. Observations showed that the soil was depleted of <b>base</b> <b>cations.</b> The measured <b>base</b> saturation in 1999 was between 5 and 8 % in the different soil layers. Model predictions assuming full implementation of the UNECE 1999 Gothenburg Protocol and present day <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> deposition show that the base saturation will slowly increase to 20 % by 2100. Despite large emission reductions, Istebna still suffers from the very high loads of acidifying input during the past decades. Soil recovery depends on future emissions especially on <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> deposition. The recovery will be even slower if the <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> deposition decreases further.

40|$|International audienceFree lipids {{extracted}} from the surface horizon of ten soil profiles were studied {{in order to enhance}} the knowledge on these non-humic substances. Profiles were distributed from the sahelian to the south sudanian zones of Burkina Faso. Biological, physical and chemical properties were determined. Lipids, {{extracted from}} each sample with chloroform, were derivatised and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The amounts of free lipids which ranged from 35 to 137 mg. kg- 1 soil represented less than 1 % of total carbon. Identified compounds were mono-and di-fatty acids (as methyl esters), alcohols (acetylated), alkanes, steroids and hopanoids. These compounds are characteristic of a dominant plant origin. However branched acids and a part of diacids are of bacterial origin. Moreover the amount of free lipids negatively correlates with the sum of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations,</b> <b>cations</b> <b>exchangeable</b> capacity (CEC) and useful water supply. However, the amounts of nonadecanoic (C 19), palmitic (C 16) and stearic (C 18) acids are positively correlated, respectively with the previous soil chemical properties, the cumulative carbon mineralization and the carbon from microbial biomass...|$|R
40|$|Whole-tree {{harvesting}}, i. e. harvesting of stems, {{branches and}} tops, {{has become increasingly}} common during recent decades due to the increased demand for renewable energy. Whole-tree harvesting leads {{to an increase in}} <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> losses from the ecosystem, which can counteract recovery from acidification. An increase in weathering rates due to higher temperatures is sometimes suggested as a process that may counteract the acidifying effect of whole-tree harvesting. In this study the potential effect of increasing temperature on weathering rates was compared with the increase in <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> losses following whole-tree harvesting in spruce forests, along a temperature gradient in Sweden. The mechanistic model PROFILE was used to estimate weathering rates at National Forest Inventory sites at today’s temperature and the temperature in 2050, as estimated by two different climate projections. The same dataset was used to calculate <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> losses following stem-only and whole-tree harvesting. The calculations showed that the increase in temperature until 2050 would result in an increase in the <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> weathering rate of 20 – 33 %, and that whole-tree harvesting would lead to an increase in <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> losses of 66 % on average, compared to stem-only harvesting. A sensitivity analysis showed that moisture changes are important for future weathering rates, but the effect of the temperature change was dominating even when the most extreme moisture changes were applied. It was concluded that an increase in weathering rates resulting from higher temperatures would not compensate for the increase in <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> losses following whole-tree harvesting, except in the northernmost part of Sweden...|$|R
