40|$|<b>Brominated</b> {{vegetable}} <b>oils</b> {{can be used}} as stabilisers for aroma oils in fruity flavoured beverages. In the USA {{these substances}} are approved for up to 15 mg/L (15 ppm). In the European Union (EU), these vegetable oils are not permitted as additives. For this reason, products containing <b>brominated</b> vegetable <b>oils</b> and / or their components (brominated fatty acids) cannot, irrespective of the content, be traded. At the instance of the German food safety authority which rejected two beverages imported from the USA, the BfR was asked to assess the health effects of soft drinks to which <b>brominated</b> vegetable <b>oils</b> are added. Animal experiments with <b>brominated</b> vegetable <b>oils</b> have shown that brominated fatty acids may be deposited in various organs. In case of high dosage, the weight of the organs can increase, and the organs themselves may change as a result. At very high doses, the substances had an effect on fertility. No long-term studies required to derive no observed adverse effect levels (NOAEL) have been published as yet. Based on the current state of knowledge, no acute risks from soft drinks with contents up to 15 mg/L of brominated fatty acids can be derived. The case studies cited in this context about a connection between high consumption of soft drinks containing added <b>brominated</b> vegetable <b>oils</b> and adverse health effects are not plausible from a scientific viewpoint, nor do they prove a general risk. In the opinion of the BfR, it is notably not sufficiently clear whether brominated fatty acids may have any long-term health effects. The same applies to their accumulation potential in humans which many be higher than in the tested animal species. In this context, the high accumulation levels observed in children in particular requires clarification. As a general principle, the use of substances which have high accumulation potential in humans is to be seen as undesirable in food production...|$|R

40|$|Consumer's {{demand for}} more natural and high quality food {{products}} products, presenting health benefits, has increased over the years. Besides the nutritional aspects, an appealing appearance and texture is also required. Cloudiness or opacity (cloudy appearance) is an important citrus drinks property (orange, lime, lemon, etc.), since it gives natural fruit juice appeal. This property can be achieved through addition of clouding agents, which also help in uniform distribution of flavors throughout the liquid beverage. A common problem in the beverage industry is producing cloud or flavor emulsions that remain stable over the desired shelf life. Beverage cloud emulsions are oil-in-water emulsions to provide cloudiness and are prepared in a concentrated form, but diluted prior to the consumption. Optical and rheological properties of beverage cloud emulsions {{as a function of}} water-phase and oil-phase concentrations were investigated. The specific gravity of phases, particle size distribution and creaming stability of prepared emulsions in diluted forms were evaluated. The rate of cloud emulsion creaming by determining the rheology of water phase, difference in specific gravities of the phases and droplet properties of the emulsion in presence and absence of weighting agents (sucrose acetate isobutyrate and <b>brominated</b> vegetable <b>oil)</b> or/and xanthan gum was studied. Flow and dynamic rheological properties of single-phases and emulsions containing modified starch and arabic gum as surface active hydrocolloids as well as xanthan and tragacanth as stabilizers gums were investigated. Finally, stability of cloud emulsions in orange juice drink was examined. Oil-phase concentration had a significant effect (P < 0. 05) on increasing the opacity of emulsion. Raise in viscosity of emulsions was more pronounced as oil concentration increased and shear thinning behavior of oil added emulsions was associated with droplet flocculation. Creaming in acidified sugar solution of 11 °Bx and pH 3 was observed when the oil-phase specific gravity decreased and sedimentation occurred at the lower viscosity of water phase. Addition of xanthan gum into the water phase decreased the flow behavior index (n) form 0. 88 down to 0. 31 and increased elastic modulus (G') over 20 times at elevated frequency (o = 50 rad/s) and perk up the stability of the emulsion. The xanthan gum added emulsion indicated smaller average particle size and demonstrated 14 and 5 times slower separation compared to the emulsions without or with the addition of weighting agents respectively. Starch-xanthan stabilized emulsion and associated water phase at 1. 5 : 1 surface active gum to oil ratio demonstrated viscoelastic behavior (G' ≥ G") with lower droplets coalescence and creaming rates, 0. 013 nm/day and 0. 02 percent backscattering/day respectively. Conversely, arabic-xanthan stabilized emulsion at 1 : 1 gum to oil ratio showed the highest rate of droplets coalescence at 0. 057 rim/day and greater degree of creaming at 0. 61 percent transmission/day. While creaming were associated with arabic gum stabilized emulsions, after 3 month storage, modified starch illustrated appropriate shelf stability with no sign of creaming in orange juice drink...|$|R
