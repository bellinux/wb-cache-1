In addition to actions in Selma, marches and other protests in support of voting rights were held in neighboriing Perry, Wilcox, Marengo, Greene, and Hale counties. Attempts were made to organize in Lowndes County, <b>but</b> <b>fear</b> of the Klan there was so intense from previous violence and murders that blacks would not support a nonviolent campaign in great number, even after Dr. King made a personal appearance on March 1.|$|E

25|$|Early in 298 BC a Lucanian {{delegation}} went to Rome {{to ask the}} Romans to {{take them}} under their protection as the Samnites, having failed to bring them into an alliance, had invaded their territory. Rome agreed to an alliance. Fetials were sent to Samnium to order the Samnites to leave Lucania. The Samnites threatened their safety and Rome declared war. Dionysius of Halicarnassus thought {{that the cause of}} the war was not Roman compassion for the wronged, <b>but</b> <b>fear</b> of the strength the Samnites would gain if they subdued the Lucanians. Oakley suggests that Rome might well have deliberately sought a new war with Samnium by allying with her enemies.|$|E
25|$|As {{well as a}} {{shortage}} of accommodation, there was {{a serious lack of}} medical personnel to care for the sick. Dr. Douglas attempted to enlist nurses from among the healthy female passengers with the promise of high wages, <b>but</b> <b>fear</b> of disease meant none accepted. Nurses were expected to sleep alongside the sick and share their food; they had no privacy, often caught the fever themselves and were not helped when they fell ill. Prisoners from the local jail were released to carry out the nursing, but many stole from the dead and the dying. All of the medical officers involved became ill at some stage, with four doctors dying of typhus. Under the Passenger Act of 1842, ships were not obliged to carry a doctor, and only two doctors arrived as passengers. One of these was a Dr. Benson from Dublin, a man with experience working in fever hospitals in Ireland. He arrived on May 21, volunteered to help the sick, contracted typhus himself and was dead within six days.|$|E
25|$|Purchased as an undisciplined and disheveled recruit in {{the first}} episode, Crixus the Gaul {{initially}} endures mockery and threats of death, before eventually rising to become a gladiator of skill and fame second only to Gannicus. As Batiatus fends off repeated attempts by his professional rival Tullius to obtain Gannicus, his relationships with his father Titus and friend Solonius begin to suffer the strain of Quintus' relentless ambition. Former champion gladiator Oenomaus reluctantly retires from combat to become Doctore, while Syrian recruits Ashur and Dagan become fierce enemies as Ashur tries to prove himself worthy of being a gladiator. Veteran gladiators Barca and Gannicus accept the rising star of Crixus <b>but</b> <b>fear</b> that their own careers will suffer, as the machinations of Batiatus and Lucretia to court Capua's elite end in tragedy for {{several members of the}} household. Against all of this, the city's splendid new arena nears completion and with it the opening games that will make men into gods. When the arena opens Solonius' and Batiatus' gladiators compete with each other, Batiatus' gladiators prevailing in the contest. Gannicus again proves himself to be the champion of Capua and the god of the arena and by virtue of his win against Solonius' gladiators, becomes the champion of Capua and gains his freedom.|$|E

Just as the two give in to their feelings fully, Clark unexpectedly runs away from Smallville in the season two finale. At the start of season three, it is shown that Lana, alongside the Kents, has been spending her time searching for Clark; she ultimately finds him in Metropolis thanks to Chloe's help. Clark's actions in Metropolis force the two to rethink their relationship in the season three episode [...] "Phoenix", and Lana eventually begins a new relationship with Adam Knight (Ian Somerhalder), a guy she met while in physical therapy after being trampled by a horse in season three's [...] "Asylum". By the season three episode [...] "Crisis", it is discovered that the relationship Adam attempted to form with Lana was just a ploy so that Adam could investigate Clark.|$|E
500|$|One of Walter's {{subjects}} {{is young}} Olivia Dunham (Karley Scott Collins), aka [...] "Subject 13". Walter suspects Olivia's stepfather (Chris Bradford) is abusing her based on bruises she carries and frightening drawings in her sketchbook, but Olivia refuses {{to talk about}} it. One night, as Olivia {{is about to be}} struck by her stepfather, she temporarily finds herself in a different place; the next day, she draws in her sketchbook a picture of what she saw in the other place: a zeppelin (which are a common mode of transportation in the alternate universe). Walter realizes that Olivia crossed over to the parallel universe, and can be the means for returning Peter. Walter puts Olivia under several tests to try to coax her to cross over, eventually eliminating all emotions <b>but</b> <b>fear</b> as the triggering mechanism. He arranges a traumatic test for Olivia, but instead of crossing over, she exhibits pyrokinesis and sets the room afire. In the confusion of extinguishing the blaze, she disappears.|$|E
500|$|In Russia, Peter II of Russia died of {{the disease}} at 15 years of age. Also, prior to {{becoming}} Russian Emperor, Peter III caught the virus and suffered greatly from it. He was left scarred and disfigured. His wife, Catherine the Great, was spared <b>but</b> <b>fear</b> of the virus clearly had its effects on her. She feared for her son and heir Pavel's safety {{so much that she}} made sure that large crowds were kept at bay and sought to isolate him. Eventually, she decided to have herself inoculated by a Scottish doctor, Thomas Dimsdale. While this was considered a controversial method at the time, she succeeded. Her son Pavel was later inoculated as well. Catherine then sought to have inoculations throughout her empire stating: [...] "My objective was, through my example, to save from death the multitude of my subjects who, not knowing the value of this technique, and frightened of it, were left in danger." [...] By 1800, approximately 2 million inoculations were administered in the Russian Empire.|$|E

500|$|Many Simpsons {{staff members}} were fans of English comedian Ricky Gervais and his British comedy series The Office that he created and starred. In January 2004, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening called Gervais to congratulate {{him on his}} double Golden Globe win. During the phone call, Gervais was invited to lunch with Groening and {{executive}} producer Al Jean since they were big fans and wanted to meet him. At this lunch, he was offered a chance to appear in and write an episode of The Simpsons. Groening first asked Gervais for just a guest appearance, but {{came to the conclusion}} that he might be interested in writing an episode too. Gervais told The Independent that when he got the offer, [...] "well, I knew I had to say yes, <b>but</b> <b>fear</b> kicked in at exactly the same time." [...] He became the first person to be credited with simultaneously writing and guest-starring in an episode of The Simpsons. He was also the first Briton to write an episode for the show. As a big follower of The Simpsons, Gervais saw the experience as [...] "a dream come true." ...|$|E
500|$|Several co-stars found Steiger difficult; Warren Oates, {{according}} to director Norman Jewison, viewed Steiger as [...] "somebody {{who had a}} tendency to go over the top" [...] during the making of In The Heat of the Night. Writer Richard Dyer highlights the contrast in the film between the acting styles of Steiger and Poitier, with [...] "Poitier's stillness and implied intensity" [...] and [...] "Steiger's busy, exteriorised method acting". Humphrey Bogart, Steiger's co-star of The Harder They Fall, referred to Steiger's method acting as the [...] "scratch-your-ass-and-mumble school of acting". Director Robert Aldrich notes that Steiger had a habit of changing his lines, which often confused his co-stars. Aldrich stated: [...] "Usually I lie awake at nights trying to think of ways to improve an actor's performance. With Steiger, the problem is to try and contain him". Steiger was particularly aggressive towards director Kenneth Annakin during the making of Across the Bridge, insisting on rewriting most of the script and changing many of the lines to better fit Steiger's idea of the character. Annakin stated that he had [...] "never known an actor to put so much thought and preparation into a performance" [...] as Steiger. Hutchinson revealed that Steiger often suffered from panic during filming and that fear of failure haunted him throughout his life, <b>but</b> <b>fear</b> also provided him with a source of strength in his acting.|$|E

2500|$|In the words, [...] "Take no {{interest}} or increase, <b>but</b> <b>fear</b> your God," [...] in [...] "interest" [...] ( [...] , neshech) literally means [...] "bite." [...] A Midrash played on this meaning, teaching {{not to take}} interest from the poor person, not to bite the poor person as the serpent — cunning to do evil — bit Adam. The Midrash taught that one who exacts interest from an Israelite thus has no fear of God.|$|E
2500|$|Despite Scott's {{efforts to}} {{preserve}} his anonymity, almost every reviewer guessed that Waverley was his work. Many readers too recognized his hand.

For, [...] "Iago dates his maturity, as he considers it, his ability to understand the world, from {{the age at which}} he recognized every remark to be personally pointed. One only who lacks inner assurance and is so constantly on guard against any hint of his inferiority could so confess himself".|$|E

2500|$|In 1901, angry WFM members {{passed a}} {{convention}} proclamation that a [...] "complete revolution {{of social and}} economic conditions" [...] was [...] "the only salvation of the working classes." [...] Colorado employers and their supporters reacted to growing union restlessness and power in a confrontation that came to be called the Colorado Labor Wars.

2500|$|Attacks whose {{victims had}} been threatening, disciplining, disturbing, teasing, or {{annoying}} attacking wolves, their pups, families, or packs {{are classified as}} [...] "provoked", [...] "defensive" [...] or [...] "disciplinary". The attackers in such cases seem motivated, not by hunger, <b>but</b> <b>fear</b> or anger {{and the need to}} escape from or drive the victim away. Examples would include a captive wolf attacking an abusive handler; a mother wolf attacking a hiker who had wandered near her pups; an attack on a wolf hunter in active pursuit; or a wildlife photographer, park visitor, or field biologist who had gotten too close for the wolf's comfort. While such attacks may still be dangerous, they tend to be limited to quick bites and not pressed.|$|E
