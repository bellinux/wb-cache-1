5|$|In {{the western}} Italian Alps, the Alpine chough nests {{in a greater}} variety of sites than red-billed chough, using natural cliffs, pot-holes and {{abandoned}} buildings, whereas the red-billed uses only natural cliffs (although it nests in old buildings elsewhere). The Alpine chough lays its eggs about one month later than its relative, although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on <b>breeding</b> <b>behaviour.</b>|$|E

5|$|The snoring rail catches crabs in {{highland}} streams, {{and these}} crustaceans {{may be a}} major dietary item. It also forages in muddy areas, and has been recorded as consuming lizards. Nothing is known of its <b>breeding</b> <b>behaviour</b> other than a report of an adult seen feeding with two chicks in August 1983, but the original report gives no details of the claimed sighting.|$|E
5|$|Large female Murray cod in the 15– to 35-kg (35– to 80-lb) range are {{the most}} {{important}} breeders because they produce the most eggs and for other reasons; large females in most fish species are also important because they produce larger larvae with larger yolk sacs, and are also more experienced breeders that display optimal <b>breeding</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Such large females may also have valuable, successful genes to pass on. All of these factors mean the spawnings of large female fish have far higher larval survival rates and make far greater reproductive contributions than the spawnings of small female fish.|$|R
50|$|The <b>breeding</b> <b>behaviours</b> are {{influenced}} by the seasonal conditions. Under good seasonal conditions the solitary water rat comes together with their mate and may produce several litters (if young are removed will reproduce again within two months), but separate on the birth of the young. Limited information is available on home range, but suggests localised movement around the nesting sites and foraging areas. Water rats construct burrows dug into river banks but have also been documented building nests within sunken logs and reeds, in areas surrounded by roots and dense riparian vegetation for cover from predators.|$|R

5|$|These {{are small}} to medium sized birds with black plumage, strong legs and short, rounded wings. Mostly terrestrial, {{they live in}} montane forest. The greater melampitta has more {{specific}} habitat needs, roosting and nesting in limestone sinkholes. Insects and small vertebrates are taken from the forest leaf litter. Little is known about their <b>breeding</b> <b>behaviour,</b> with only the nests of the lesser melampitta having been seen by scientists.

5|$|At , it {{is a small}} honeyeater with a short {{tail and}} {{relatively}} long down-curved bill. It is sexually dimorphic; the male has a glossy red head and brown upperparts and paler grey-brown underparts while the female has predominantly grey-brown plumage. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical mangrove forests. It is very active when feeding in the tree canopy, darting from flower to flower and gleaning insects off foliage. It calls constantly as it feeds. While little has been documented on the red-headed myzomela's <b>breeding</b> <b>behaviour,</b> it is recorded as building a small cup-shaped nest in the mangroves and laying two or three oval, white eggs with small red blotches.|$|E
5|$|Its {{inaccessible}} {{habitat and}} retiring nature {{mean that the}} snoring rail is rarely seen and little is known of its behaviour. Only the adult plumage has been described, and the <b>breeding</b> <b>behaviour</b> is unrecorded. It feeds on small crabs and probably other small prey such as lizards. Although protected under Indonesian law since 1972, the rail is threatened by habitat loss (even within nature reserves), hunting for food and predation by introduced species; it is therefore evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
50|$|Eiders are colonial breeders. They nest on coastal {{islands in}} colonies {{ranging in size}} of less than 100 to upwards of 10,000-15,000 individuals. Female eiders {{frequently}} exhibit {{a high degree of}} natal philopatry, where they return to breed on the same island where they were hatched. This can lead to a high degree of relatedness between individuals nesting on the same island, as well as the development of kin-based female social structures. This relatedness has likely {{played a role in the}} evolution of co-operative <b>breeding</b> <b>behaviours</b> amongst eiders. Examples of these behaviours include laying eggs in the nests of related individuals and crèching, where female eiders team up and share the work of rearing ducklings.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} {{bald ibis}} {{is part of the}} genus Geronticus, which includes two distinct species. The {{southern bald ibis}} (Geronticus calvus) is restricted primarily to the southern regions of Africa whereas its counterpart, the waldrapp (Geronticus eremita) is found in the northern regions of the continent. Both species share common characteristics regardless of their geographic separation. Both species nest on rock cliffs and display distinct <b>breeding</b> <b>behaviours</b> adapted for their particular locations. Similarly, they both show evolutionary adaptations in foraging behaviours due to their dry habitats. The separation between these two species is believed to have occurred relatively recently. This separation, between G. calvus and G. eremita, is believed to have occurred only 335 000 to 1 million years ago.|$|R

5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} is diurnal (active mainly during the day). Though solitary by nature, {{four-horned antelope}}s may form loose {{groups of three}} to five –with one or more adults, sometimes accompanied by juveniles. This elusive antelope feeds on grasses, herbs, shrubs, foliage, flowers and fruits. It needs to drink water frequently; as such it stays in places near water sources. The <b>breeding</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the four-horned antelope has not been well studied. The age at which they reach sexual maturity and the season when mating occurs have not been understood well. Gestation lasts about eight months, following which one or two calves are born. They are kept concealed {{for the first few}} weeks of their birth. The young remain with the mother for about a year.|$|E
5|$|The gadfly petrels in {{the genus}} Pterodroma are seabirds of {{temperate}} and tropical oceans. Many are little-known, and their often similar appearance {{have caused the}} taxonomy of the group to be rather fluid. The forms breeding in Macaronesia on Madeira, Bugio in the Desertas Islands, and in the Cape Verde archipelago were long considered to be subspecies of the Southern Hemisphere soft-plumaged petrel, P. mollis, but mitochondrial DNA analysis, and differences in size, vocalisations, <b>breeding</b> <b>behaviour,</b> showed that the northern birds are not closely related to P. mollis, and that the Bermuda petrel or Cahow may be the closest relative of the Macaronesian birds. Sangster recommended establishing Zino's petrel on Madeira and Fea's petrel on the Desertas and Cape Verde as full species, and the species split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The nesting and {{breeding}} biology of antbirds {{have not been}} well studied. Even in relatively well-known species the <b>breeding</b> <b>behaviour</b> can be poorly known; for example the nest of the ocellated antbird was first described in 2004. Nests are constructed by both parents, although the male undertakes more {{of the work in}} some species. Antbird nests are cups of vegetation such as twigs, dead leaves and plant fibre, and they follow two basic patterns: either suspended or supported. Suspended cups, which may hang from forks in branches, or between two branches, are the more common style of nest. Supported nests rest upon branches, amongst vines, in hollows, and sometimes on mounds of vegetation on the ground. Each species nests at the level where it forages, so a midstory species would build its nest in the midstory. Closely related species nest in the same ways. For example, antvireos in the genus Dysithamnus are all suspension nesters.|$|E

25|$|Pelagic spawners: {{a type of}} {{broadcast}} spawners, spawn in the open sea, mostly near the surface. They are usually pelagic fish such as tuna and sardines. Some demersal fish leave the bottom to spawn pelagically, particularly coral reef fish such as parrotfish and wrasses. Pelagic spawning means water currents widely disperse the young. The eggs, embryos and larvae of pelagic spawners contain oil globules or have a high water content. As a result, they are buoyant and are widely dispersed by currents. The downside is that mortality is high, {{because they can be}} eaten so easily by pelagic predators or they can drift into unsuitable areas. Females compensate by spawning large numbers of eggs and extending their spawning periods. Pelagic spawners that live in or around coral reefs can spawn a small number of eggs almost daily over a period of months. These fishes have complex <b>breeding</b> <b>behaviours</b> including sex changes, harems, leks and territoriality. See also: Coral reef fish.|$|R

50|$|Animals can be {{selectively}} bred {{for certain}} behavioural characteristics, {{such as having}} strong maze-solving skills.

500|$|Historical {{descriptions}} of the great auk <b>breeding</b> <b>behaviour</b> are somewhat unreliable. Great Auks began pairing in early and mid-May. They {{are believed to have}} mated for life (although some theorize that great auks could have mated outside their pair, a trait seen in the razorbill). Once paired, they nested at the base of cliffs in colonies, likely where they copulated. Mated pairs had a social display in which they bobbed their heads and displayed their white eye patch, bill markings, and yellow mouth. These colonies were extremely crowded and dense, with some estimates stating that there was a nesting great auk for every [...] of land. These colonies were very social. When the colonies included other species of alcid, the great auks were dominant due to their size.|$|E
500|$|<b>Breeding</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{is known}} {{only for the}} African river martin. It nests in large colonies of up to 800 birds from December to April, when the river levels are low. Each pair excavates a [...] long tunnel in the exposed sandbanks. The pocket {{at the end of}} the tunnel has a few twigs and leaves to serve as a nest, onto which two to four unspotted white eggs are laid. It has chasing flight {{displays}} and will walk on the ground; it also displays on the ground, but the function of this is uncertain. It rarely perches during the breeding season. Although it has been assumed that the breeding habits of the white-eyed species resemble those of the African species, distinctive differences in foot and toe morphology suggest that it might not use a burrow for nesting.|$|E
500|$|The {{breeding}} {{season of the}} Siberian accentor is from June to August. Little is known about territorial or <b>breeding</b> <b>behaviour,</b> but birds of the nominate subspecies tend to occur in small groups of two to six closely spaced nests.

The age at which sexual maturity is gained is doubted; two captive females had their first parturition at less than two years. The breeding season in Panna National Park probably lasts from May to July, and from June to August in Mudumalai National Park. The male approaches the female in a relaxed gait, giving out low coughs. The two may kneel and push against each other with the necks intertwined. The male makes a few short mounting attempts; the female may be foraging all the while without any reaction. Gestation lasts about eight months, followed by the birth {{of one or two}} calves.

500|$|The <b>{{breeding}}</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the melampittas is {{only known}} in any detail for the lesser melampitta. All {{that is known}} of the breeding of the greater melampitta are reports from local people that it creates nests that are baskets of vines suspended in the limestone sinkholes that it roosts in. There is also some evidence {{that it may be}} territorial. The lesser melampitta is known to start nesting in the dry season and continue into the beginning of the wet. The nest is a closed dome shape constructed out of live green moss. The nest that has been described was found [...] from the ground {{on the side of a}} tree fern, with nesting material woven into the bark and attached to dead fronds of the tree fern to secure it. The female lays a single chalky white and slightly speckled egg, which measures , and undertakes all the incubation duties. The incubation is quite long for a small passerine, lasting around 27 days, during which the male will feed the female. Both sexes feed the single chick, which is hatched covered in downy feathers. Unlike their relatives in the birds of paradise family, which feed their chicks by regurgitation, the parents feed the chick whole food that has not been swallowed. The chick takes up to 35 days to fledge, a long time for passerines.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of the {{breeding}} season flocks disperse into pairs.

40|$|Embryonic {{mortality}} in many aquatic animals, including most amphibian species, is usually very high. In addition to mechanical and chem- ical defences, some species have developed behavioural patterns that can increase egg survival. For example, females of some newt species protect their eggs by wrapping them in leaves of aquatic plants. We {{have studied the}} effects of ammonium nitrate (nominal concentration of 90. 3 mg N–NO 3 NH 4 /L) and water acidification (pH 4 – 5) on egg wrapping behaviour of the dwarf newt, Triturus pygmaeus, and on whether this specific behaviour may protect embryos from contamination. Although either ammonium nitrate or low pH did not inhibit oviposition, the mean percentage of eggs that were wrapped by the females was significantly lower at low pH than in controls. In order to assess the potential effects of oviposition behaviour on embryonic survival, we exposed simultaneously wrapped and unwrapped eggs to ammonium nitrate and acid pH during their development. After 25 days of exposure, ammonium nitrate reduced length and developmental stage at eclosion of the exposed individuals, {{regardless of whether they}} were wrapped or unwrapped. The fertilizer caused a significantly higher {{mortality in}} unwrapped than wrapped eggs. The potential impact of water pollution on amphibians in the field may include not only direct effects on embryonic and larval survival but also alteration of <b>breeding</b> <b>behaviours,</b> which may reduce reproductive success and ultimately affect population’s condition.
