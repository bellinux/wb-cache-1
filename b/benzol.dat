While {{the damage to}} Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with <b>benzol</b> that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These ignited the vapours from the <b>benzol.</b> A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly {{up the side of}} the ship as the <b>benzol</b> spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.|$|E
25|$|Historian Alfred C. Mierzejewski {{argues that}} both area bombing and attacks against fuel plants were {{ineffective}} against Germany's coal- and rail-based economy {{and that the}} bombing campaign only took a decisive turn in late 1944 when the allies switched to targeting railway-marshalling yards for the coal gateways of the Ruhr. His summation is rejected by Sebastian Cox head of the Air Historical Branch (AHB). Cox notes {{that half of the}} oil was produced by <b>Benzol</b> plants located in the Ruhr. These areas were the primary target of Bomber Command in 1943 and the autumn of 1944. Cox concludes that the targets were highly vulnerable to area attacks and suffered accordingly. The American official history notes that Harris was ordered to cease attacks on oil in November 1944, as the combined bombing had been so effective that none of the synthetic plants were operating effectively. The American history also includes information from Albert Speer, in which he points out that Bomber Command's night attacks were the most effective.|$|E

2500|$|The Military Aviation Service of Chile {{placed an}} initial order for twelve Vixen Vs in May 1925, this being {{increased}} to 18 in July. While prone to engine problems {{owing to the}} problems with the special fuel (⅔ petrol to ⅓ <b>benzol)</b> required for the high-compression Lion V engine, and requiring frequent re-rigging owing to the use of wooden wings in the high temperature of Northern Chile, the Vixen Vs, operated by the Grupo Mixto de Aviación N° 3. were popular in Chilean service, being used for long-distance flights of several hundred miles and continued in service for several years. Vixens participated in bombing raids against mutinying ships of the Chilean Navy (including the Battleship [...] ) during the Sailors' mutiny of September 1931.|$|E
2500|$|Accordingly, a {{standard}} Mk I K9834 (the 48th production Spitfire) {{was taken off}} the production line and modified for the attempt on the World Speed Record. All military equipment was removed and the hinged gun panels, radio door and flare chute opening were replaced with removable panels. A special [...] "sprint" [...] version of the Merlin II, running on a special [...] "racing fuel" [...] of gasoline, <b>benzol</b> and methanol, {{with a small amount of}} tetraethyl lead was able to generate 2,100hp (1,565kW) for short periods. This drove a Watts coarse pitch, four bladed wood propeller of [...] in diameter. Cooling the more powerful engine was achieved using a pressurised water system. This required a deeper radiator inside a lengthened duct which extended to the trailing edge of the starboard wing. A larger diameter oil cooler was fitted under the port wing. The wingspan was reduced to 33ft 9 in (10.28 m) and the wingtips were rounded.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} stages of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)'s 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia, Blažić argued that the American-led {{coalition}} was targeting chemical industry facilities [...] "in an obvious attempt to cause an environmental disaster." [...] He later accused NATO of using chemical and radioactive weapons against Yugoslavia in breach of international conventions, adding that NATO's [...] "carpet-bombing" [...] of Kosovo and Metohija raised the question of whether the military alliance actually wanted Albanian refugees to return to the area as it claimed. At one press conference, Blažić accused NATO of violating international conventions pertaining to oil pollution, <b>benzol</b> poisoning, prevention of risk of cancer, cross-border air pollution, ozone layer protection, protection of the flora and fauna, and protection of workers from occupational hazards. Following the conclusion of the bombing campaign, he suggested that the smoke and toxic fumes caused by NATO's actions might have contributed to the heavy rainstorms and other bad weather affecting Serbia in the summer of 1999.|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "benzene" [...] derives {{historically}} from [...] "gum benzoin" [...] (benzoin resin), an aromatic resin {{known to}} European pharmacists and perfumers since the 15th {{century as a}} product of southeast Asia. An acidic material was derived from benzoin by sublimation, and named [...] "flowers of benzoin", or benzoic acid. The hydrocarbon derived from benzoic acid thus acquired the name benzin, <b>benzol,</b> or benzene. Michael Faraday first isolated and identified benzene in 1825 from the oily residue derived from the production of illuminating gas, giving it the name bicarburet of hydrogen.H6, although he doesn't realize it because he (like most chemists at that time) used the wrong atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12). In 1833, Eilhard Mitscherlich produced it by distilling benzoic acid (from gum benzoin) and lime. He gave the compound the name benzin. In 1836, the French chemist Auguste Laurent named the substance [...] "phène"; this word has become the root of the English word [...] "phenol", which is hydroxylated benzene, and [...] "phenyl", the radical formed by abstraction of a hydrogen atom (free radical H•) from benzene.|$|E
2500|$|The {{crippling}} of Germany's {{warning system}} in the west {{as a result of}} the Allied victory in France and the increased efficiency of blind-bombing techniques made such RAF missions possible, and they proved generally successful. Speer subsequently reported to Hitler that the night attacks were more effective than the daylight missions, because heavier bombs were used and greater accuracy had been attained. On the average, British operation against oil targets during the autumn, [...] fell as compared with [...] for a USSTAF mission. Germany's oil production for November was estimated at 31% of the monthly average in the preceding spring, with most of the supply coming from the <b>benzol</b> plants, which had not been regarded as worth attacking until the autumn. Pölitz and Merseburg-Leuna were listed as heavily damaged but in partial operation. All of the synthetic plants in western Germany, however, were reported out of action and the crude refineries around Hamburg, Bremen, and Vienna as functioning only on a small scale. In fact, the evidence indicated that only one sizable crude-oil refinery was operating in Germany. Since the beginning of the oil offensive the 15AF had dropped , the 8th Air Force , and Bomber Command [...] on oil-producing targets.|$|E
