5000|$|There {{are three}} types of mowers: sickle <b>bar</b> <b>mowers,</b> disc mowers, and drum <b>mowers.</b> Sickle <b>bar</b> <b>mowers</b> use a {{reciprocating}} blade to cut the grass and typically use a reel to fold the grass over the knife. Disc mowers {{have a number of}} hubs across the cutting width, each hub having a small (18") rotating disc with knives. Drum mowers use two or three large plates (called the drums, about 36" [...] across) which ride over the ground as they are spinning. A sickle <b>bar</b> <b>mower's</b> main advantage over disc mowers and drum mowers is the reduced horsepower requirements. Its disadvantage is the extra maintenance required due to the high number of moving parts and wear items. Disc mowers were historically considered an [...] "all the eggs in one basket" [...] kind of mower because all the mower hubs were in one large gearbox. If one blade hit something and a gear tooth broke, the whole gearbox would suffer a catastrophic failure, and there would be nothing worth fixing. If anything broke, everything broke. Drum mowers prevented this by having typically two belt-driven drums compared to six or more gear-driven hubs. Modern disc mowers use isolated gearboxes, and if one fails it can be swapped out without rebuilding the entire machine.|$|R
50|$|Sickle mowers, {{also called}} {{reciprocating}} <b>mowers,</b> <b>bar</b> <b>mowers,</b> sickle-bar mowers, or finger-bar mowers, {{have a long}} (typically six to {{seven and a half}} feet) bar on which are mounted fingers with stationary guardplates. In a channel on the bar there is a reciprocating sickle with very sharp sickle sections (triangular blades). The sickle bar is driven back and forth along the channel. The grass, or other plant matter, is cut between the sharp edges of the sickle sections and the finger-plates (this action can be likened to an electric hair clipper).|$|R
50|$|On {{draw bar}} models {{the height of}} the cut is {{determined}} using hydraulic rams on the mower itself; this requires remote hydraulics on the tractor. These mowers in this category range from 3.3 to 22 ft mowing width. Draw <b>bar</b> <b>mowers</b> which are able to mow larger widths up to 20 ft are available. These are multi-spindle and hinged so that the side wings can move over varied terrain. Also these wings can be folded up into a vertical position to reduce width for transport on roadways.|$|R
5000|$|Native Americans {{regularly}} burnt away {{trees and}} shrubs in parts of eastern Maine, in order to stimulate blueberry production. Modern farmers use various methods of burning or mowing to accomplish this. There {{are a number of}} methods grower use to stimulate blueberry production on their land such as burning the land or by using a flail mower, bush hog, lawn mower, etc. to cut the plants off as close to the ground as possible without scalping the land. These procedures are used to promote the spreading of rhizomes under the soil. Some growers use a sickle <b>bar</b> <b>mower</b> in the fall after the crop has been harvested to mow the plants off leaving roughly 1 to 2 inches of stem so the growers can then burn the remaining of the plants in the spring using less fuel for the fire.|$|E

50|$|For {{production}} agriculture, {{past and}} present, two-wheel tractors accept {{a wide range}} of implements, such as the following: For soil-working: rototillers, moldboard plows, disc-plows, rotary plows, root/tuber harvesting plows, small subsoiler plows, powered and non-powered harrows, seeders, transplanters, and planters. Even zero till/no-till planters and seeders have become available. In plant protection and weed control, two-wheel tractor implements consist of various inter-cultivators and sprayers. For harvesting, available implements are: Forage: Sickle <b>bar</b> <b>mowers,</b> disk mowers, hayrakes, hay tedders, haybalers and bale wrappers silage production. For grain harvest: reaper/grain harvesters, reaper-binders, and even combine harvesters are available typically only for Asian two-wheel tractors. For transport, trailers with capacities from 0.5 to 5 plus ton cargoes are available. General mowing implements consist of lawn mowers, brush mowers, and flail mowers. For snow removal, implements consist of snowblowers, power sweepers, and snow/dozer blades. Other implements include: chipper/shredders, log splitters, electrical generator, pressure washer, crimper-roller, fertilizer/salt/lime spreader, and stump grinder. This list of implements (which may not be complete) means that two-wheel tractors can execute practically all of the chores done by larger 4-wheel tractors, with the exception of items like front-loaders, which obviously have the physical stability requirements of a 4-wheel (two-axle) tractor.|$|R
50|$|A swather may be {{self-propelled}} via {{an internal}} combustion engine, {{or may be}} drawn by a tractor and powered through a power take-off shaft. A swather uses a sickle <b>bar</b> (see <b>mower)</b> to cut the stems of the crop. A reel helps the cut crop fall neatly onto a canvas or auger conveyor which moves it and deposits it into a windrow, with all stems oriented in the same direction. As combines replaced threshing machines, the swather was needed to replace the binder. The mown strip left behind is the swathe.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, haying has {{extended}} to Iberian Mediterranean dry grasslands potentially impacting on grassland bird ecology. We evaluated {{the impact of}} haying on a grassland bird community of South Portugal. Our main goals were: (1) to investigate the exposure of different species to haying, (2) to investigate potential removal of nests and dead birds from hayed fields by haying machinery using the ratio (REC) between the expected number of records {{and the number of}} records collected and (3) to link clutch destruction and bird mortality with haying management practices. Hayed fields were surveyed for signs of breeding and birds censused prior to mowing. Linear models were computed, linking the REC with haying machinery and sward properties. GLMs and model averaging were used to obtain models linking clutch destruction, bird mortality and haying management variables. Only 4 % of records evidenced successful nesting attempts (N[*]=[*] 177). REC evaluation suggested high nest or dead bird removal by the machinery, particularly in fields with lower vegetation biomass prior to cutting. Sickle <b>bar</b> <b>mowers</b> and one-rotor rotary rakes returned higher REC but lower probability of found nests removed from the original nesting sites comparatively to discs mowers and wheel rakes. Higher probabilities of mortality events were found in fields mown earlier (but not in all years). On the other hand, lower mortality was found in fields raked with two-rotor rotary rakes. Delayed haying, silage production in temporary crops and the use haying machinery enabling simultaneously mowing and gathering hay in lines are discussed as management alternatives...|$|R
40|$|Objetivou-se avaliar o manejo do solo na entrelinha da seringueira de forma mecânica com grade e roçadora e com cultura de cobertura sobre as propriedades físicas do solo. Para isto, implantou-se a seringueira (PB 235 e RRIM 701) em Latossolo Vermelho em Jaboticabal-SP, em 1992, de forma que a área da entrelinha da cultura foi manejada com gradagem, roçadora e cultura de cobertura kudzu-tropical (Pueraria phaseoloides). Após 8 anos de cultivo, foram analisados alguns atributos físicos do solo (densidade, macro, micro e porosidade total, granulometria e argila dispersa em água), na entrelinha da cultura. O manejo mecânico e o de culturas de cobertura na entrelinha da seringueira afetaram as propriedades físicas do solo, especialmente a porosidade e a densidade, entretanto não influenciaram significativamente a granulometria do solo. As maiores alterações físicas em função do manejo da entrelinha da seringueira manifestaram-se especialmente na camada {{superficial}} do solo (0 - 20 cm). O manejo com roçadora reduziu significativamente a porosidade do solo (0, 08 - 0, 04 m³/m³) e aumentou a sua densidade (1, 4 - 1, 5 kg/dm³), ao passo que o manejo com grade não degradou as propriedades físicas do solo, comparado com roçadora e a cultura de cobertura com kudzu tropical. This work {{aimed to}} mechanically evaluate {{the effect of}} soil management between rubber tree rows using heavy <b>bars</b> and rotary <b>mowers</b> and cover crop on the physical properties of the soil. Thus, rubber trees (PB 235 and RRIM 701) were established in a Dystrophic Hapludox soil in Jaboticabal-SP in 1992, so that the spaces between the rows were managed with heavy <b>bars,</b> rotary <b>mowers</b> and tropical Kudzu crop cover (Pueraria phaseoloides). After eight cropping years, some physical attributes of the soil (density, macro and microporosity, particle size and water clay dispersion) were analyzed in the rows. The mechanical and cover crop management {{in the space between}} the rows had affected the physical properties of the soil, especially porosity and density although not influencing significantly soil particle size. The greatest physical alterations in the soil in function of the management of the space between the rubber tree rows became evident only in the superficial layer of the soil (0 - 20 cm). Rotary mower management significantly reduced soil porosity (0. 08 - 0. 04 m³/m³) and increased soil density (1. 4 - 1. 5 kg/dm³) while management with heavy bars did not degrade the physical properties of the soil compared with the rotary mowers and crop cover using tropical Kudzu...|$|R
50|$|The tractor {{is built}} using a {{frameless}} block construction. The rear axle is a portal axle, the front axle is a swing axle. The wheelbase is 1668 mm. The {{track of the}} front wheels can be increased by turning the rims on the vertical axis. The internal expanding brake brakes the back wheels only. It can also act as a steering brake. The steering gear and the gearbox were produced by ZF Friedrichshafen. All Porsche-Diesel 218 tractors have a six gear gearbox with a crawler gear. The clutch is the single-disk dry clutch K 200 Z by Fichtel & Sachs. It operates with an oil hydraulic clutch by Voith. The exception is the Standard V 218, which has a five gear gearbox only. It also lacks the oil hydraulic clutch. Porsche-Diesel offered a Three-point linkage as an optional equipment. It can lift up to 550 kg The second optional equipment is a mowing bar. It was offered for DM 500. The weight of the tractor is 1625 kg including the three-point-linkage, the <b>mower</b> <b>bar</b> and the extra weights. The maximum weight allowed is 2300kg. The paint is RAL 3002 Karminrot for the body and RAL 1014 or 1015 Elfenbein for the rims. The Standard 218 doesn't have a fuel tap due to tightness problems.|$|R
