5|$|Animals {{including}} {{birds and}} turtles can detect the Earth's magnetic field, {{and use the}} field to navigate during migration. Some {{researchers have found that}} cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north-south while relaxing, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>when</b> the animals are under high-voltage power lines, suggesting that magnetism is responsible. Other researchers reported in 2011 that they could not replicate those findings using different Google Earth images.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{even when}} blind, house sparrows {{continue}} to be photoperiodic, i.e. show reproductive development when the days are long, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>when</b> the days are short. This response is stronger when the feathers {{on top of the}} head are plucked, and is eliminated when India ink is injected under the skin {{at the top of the}} head, showing that the photoreceptors involved in the photoperiodic response to day length are located inside the brain.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} insects are toxic or distasteful {{when they have}} fed on certain plants that contain {{chemicals}} of particular classes, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>when</b> they have fed on plants that lack those chemicals. For instance, some species of the subfamily Danainae feed on various species of the Asclepiadoideae in the family Apocynaceae, which render them poisonous and emetic to most predators. Such insects frequently are aposematically coloured and patterned. When feeding on innocuous plants however, they are harmless and nutritious, but a bird that once has sampled a toxic specimen is unlikely to eat harmless specimens that have the same aposematic coloration. When regarded as mimicry of toxic {{members of the same}} species, this too may be seen as automimicry.|$|E
5|$|People who stutter include British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, orator Demosthenes, King George VI, actor James Earl Jones, {{and country}} singer Mel Tillis. Churchill, whose stutter was {{particularly}} apparent to 1920s writers, {{was one of}} the 30% of stutterers who have an associated speech disorder—a lisp in his case—yet led his nation through World War II. Demosthenes stammered and was inarticulate as a youth, yet, through dedicated practice, using methods such as placing pebbles in his mouth, became a great orator of Ancient Greece. King George VI hired speech therapist Lionel Logue to enable him to speak to his Empire, and Logue effectively helped him accomplish this goal. This training and its results are the focus of the 2010 film The King's Speech. James Earl Jones has stated he was mute for many years of his youth yet he became an actor noted for the power of his voice. Mel Tillis stutters when talking <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>when</b> singing. Many people had their speech impediment only as a child and have overcome their condition.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, some {{influential}} style guides, {{many of them}} American, still require {{periods in}} certain instances. For example, The New York Times' guide recommends following each segment with a period when the letters are pronounced individually, as in K.G.B., <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>when</b> pronounced as a word, as in NATO. The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the punctuation scheme.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{conducted}} in rats {{have indicated that}} their degree of sexual arousal is sensitive to reductions in testosterone. When testosterone-deprived rats were given medium levels of testosterone, their sexual behaviors (copulation, partner preference, etc.) resumed, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>when</b> given low amounts of the same hormone. Therefore, these mammals may provide a model for studying clinical populations among humans suffering from sexual arousal deficits such as hypoactive sexual desire disorder.|$|E

25|$|Studies in the 1970s {{reported}} {{that the use of}} cannabis may lower intraocular pressure. In an effort to determine whether marijuana, or drugs derived from it, might be effective as a glaucoma treatment, the US National Eye Institute supported research studies from 1978 to 1984. These studies demonstrated some derivatives of marijuana lowered intraocular pressure when administered orally, intravenously, or by smoking, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>when</b> topically applied to the eye.|$|E
25|$|People {{tend to be}} more optimistically biased {{when they}} believe they have more control over events than others. For example, {{people are more likely to}} think that they will not be harmed in a car {{accident}} if they are driving the vehicle. Another example is that if someone believes that they have a lot of control over becoming infected with HIV, they are more likely to view their risk of contracting the disease to be low. Studies have suggested that the greater perceived control someone has, the greater their optimistic bias. Stemming from this, control is a stronger factor when it comes to personal risk assessments, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>when</b> assessing others.|$|E
25|$|Blocking {{plasticity}} in {{this region}} results in problems in goal-directed navigation and impairs the ability to remember precise locations. Amnesic patients with damage to the hippocampus cannot learn or remember spatial layouts and patients having undergone hippocampal removal are severely impaired in spatial navigation. Monkeys with lesions to this area cannot learn object-place associations and rats also display spatial deficits by not reacting to spatial change. In addition, rats with hippocampal lesions were shown to have temporally ungraded (time-independent) retrograde amnesia that is resistant to recognition of a learned platform task only when the entire hippocampus is lesioned, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>when</b> it is partially lesioned. Deficits in spatial memory are also found in spatial discrimination tasks.|$|E

25|$|A {{manifolded}} {{twin set}} with isolation valve {{is a special}} case. It is a redundant air supply when the isolation valve is closed, as the cylinders are then for most practical purposes independent, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>when</b> it is open, as a leak will eventually drain both cylinders. Divers who intend {{to rely on a}} manifolded twin for bailout {{need to be able to}} isolate the cylinders quickly, as a major leak can drain a set in quite a short time. In comparison with independent twins, the manifolded set is less task loading through the most of the dive, but requires skilled and immediate reaction in the event of a catastrophic failure, as it does not fail safe. If diving as part of a team, the risk is mitigated by the presence of buddies who can help.|$|E
25|$|Topical {{application}} of progesterone {{with the intention}} of systemic therapy should not be equated with local treatment. Despite {{the fact that it is}} not approved for use in menopausal HRT, topical progesterone is registered in some countries under the brand name Progestogel as a 1% gel for direct local application to the breasts to treat premenstrual mastodynia (breast pain). It has been found in clinical studies to inhibit estrogen-induced proliferation of breast epithelial cells and to abolish breast pain and tenderness in women with the condition. The effectiveness of topical progesterone for this indication may be related in part to the fact that the site of {{application of}} topical progesterone has been found to significantly influence its absorption. A study observed a significant increase in serum levels of progesterone when it was applied as a topical ointment to the breasts <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>when</b> it was applied to other areas like the thigh or abdomen.|$|E
25|$|Some {{laboratory}} research demonstrate correlations between psychopathy and atypical responses to aversive stimuli, including weak conditioning to painful stimuli and poor learning of avoiding responses that cause punishment, {{as well as}} low reactivity in the autonomic nervous system as measured with skin conductance while waiting for a painful stimulus <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>when</b> the stimulus occurs. While {{it has been argued}} that the reward system functions normally, some studies have also found reduced reactivity to pleasurable stimuli. According to the response modulation hypothesis, psychopathic individuals have also had difficulty switching from an ongoing action despite environmental cues signaling a need to do so. This may explain the difficulty responding to punishment, although it is unclear if it can explain findings such as deficient conditioning. There may be methodological issues regarding the research. While establishing a range of idiosyncrasies on average in linguistic and affective processing under certain conditions, this research program has not confirmed a common pathology of psychopathy.|$|E

25|$|As a major, {{he landed}} in France on Gold Beach on D-Day on 6 June 1944, as Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General (DAQMG) of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, a first line TA formation, {{under the command}} of Major-General Douglas Graham. Macleod {{embarked}} on 1 June, ready for the invasion which was then postponed from 5 June to 6 June. The 50th Division, a highly experienced veteran formation which had fought in North Africa and Sicily, was tasked with capturing Arromanches, where the Mulberry artificial harbour was to be set up, {{and by the end of}} the day patrols had pushed to the outskirts of Bayeux. Macleod spent much of the day touring the beachhead area to check on progress, driving past enemy-held strongpoints, with Lieutenant Colonel “Bertie” Gibb. He later recorded that he had “a patchwork of memories” of D-Day. He could remember what he ate <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>when</b> he ate it, or that when he went to load his revolver he found his batman had instead filled his ammunition pouch with boiled sweets. British planners had expected 40% casualties on D-Day, and Macleod later recorded that he himself had fully expected to be killed, but on realising at midnight that he had survived D-Day decided that he would survive the war and see the birth of his second child in October.|$|E
