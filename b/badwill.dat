The first part of the album Trilogija (Trilogy), Trilogija 1: Nevinost bez zaštite (Trilogy 1: Virginity without Protection) was released in 2005, and the second and the third, Trilogija 2: Devičanska ostrva (Trilogy 2: Virgin Islands) and Trilogija 3: Ambasadori loše volje (Trilogy 3: <b>Badwill</b> Ambassadors) were released in 2006. On March 10, 2007, the band held a concert in Belgrade Arena. The concert featured Radio Television of Serbia Symphony Orchestra and Obilić Academic Choir, both conducted by Vojkan Borisavljević. On the concert, Đorđević jokingly introduced the members of the band as convicts and fugitives indicted for war crimes: Nikola Zorić as Veselin Šljivančanin, Miša Aleksić as Biljana Plavšić, Vicko Milatović as Milorad Ulemek [...] "Legija", Vidoja Božinović as Ratko Mladić, and himself as Radovan Karadžić; the introduction of Milatović as Ulemek was much criticized by the Serbian public. The recording of the concert was released on the album Gladijatori u BG Areni (Gladiators in BG Arena), both in a live album and video album version.|$|E

However, we wonder, in support to all interested groups in Romania, what would be the economic interpretation and perception of this difference? Thereby, if we start our analysis with how the acquisition difference is perceived, we consider appropriate to mention that the difference from the first consolidation can be emphasized if the cost of securities acquisition is compared with the net asset value of the percentage rate at which the securities will entitle. consolidation, informational offer, consolidated financial statements, fidelity and relevance...|$|E

The results of this research allowed us to develop this field at the level that exceeds the achievements, both in Romania and in Europe. We refer to the possibility to apply the subtle sets to the valuation of goodwill elements that enhance a company’s value. The evaluation of such elements is currently made by means of an accounting approach, which does not respond to the requirements of informing the future buyers. fuzzy theory, subtle sets theory, goodwill, <b>badwill...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the accounting treatment of goodwill, namely, its recognition, assessment and accounting, {{as part of}} the patrimonial assets of an economic entity. Specific, due to its structure, to any blocks of companies, the goodwill re{{presents the}} cost surplus of an active block to the market value of the net purchased assets. Why would anyone pay for a company more than its actual accounting worth? Because the extra price is usually attributed to those intangible elements that cannot be assessed separately but whose horizon of expectation is usually related to prospective economic advantages such as the clientele, the top commercial location, the employees' level of training, market shares, good relationships with the employees, the suppliers, the banks etc. Many of the Romanian economic entities were sold at a price that was inferior to their accounting value because, following their assessment, the experts were able to ascertain the following: the existence of fixed assets that needed to be scrapped; the existence of stocks that were either depreciated or difficult to sell; the existence of outstanding debts that were either uncertain of lost for good; the existence of major debts carrying interest. The effect of such assessments led to a reduced marked value of all assets and an increased market value of the debts, or in other words, the possibility of a <b>badwill</b> occurrence. The relationship goodwill – <b>badwill,</b> specific to the blocks of trading companies, represents a current challenge in the recognition and evaluation of the goodwill in compliance with the current Romanian legislation as harmonized with the international accountancy standards. positive goodwill, negative goodwill, tangible assets, goodwill generated in-house, retrievable valu...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} the self-regulation of advertising in Sweden from 1950 until 1971. Self-regulation was initiated in the 1930 s due to a business desire to regulate fair competition in marketing, and while it initially was a minor operation, the 1950 s and 1960 s were characterized by extensive development. When self-regulation was overtaken by state policies in 1971, it included several interlocking systems, of which parts survived the introduction of the state regime. The thesis’ aim has been to analyze how the rapid regime transitions in the self-regulation regime can be understood. The existing literature identifies four major transitions that occurred during the studied time period. To understand them, the thesis has studied the policy processes leading up to these transitions. Focus has been on the business interest organizations that controlled the regime and their regulatory strategies. Theoretically, the analysis has departed from the hypothesis that tensions between these organizations, due to their members’ different market interests and varying levels of exposure to regulation and public <b>badwill,</b> to a significant degree informed their strategic choices as well as policy outcomes. The results show that the policy processes preceding the regime transitions were characterized by internal tensions, whereby organizations representing advertisers, and to a lesser degree media carriers, due to their members’ higher level of exposure to regulation and public <b>badwill,</b> successfully supported stronger market policing, while ad agencies, being less exposed, as well as a peak industry organization for the proliferation of marketing largely opposed such measures, preferring a more lenient regulation. However, due to increased exposure to regulation and bad will, the ad agencies finally abandoned their opposition and took the lead in regulatory innovation through the introduction of an extensive clearance program that survived the launch of the state regime, becoming a key component in the co-regulatory structure that followed...|$|E

The study examines how this company {{can create a}} stronger brand for themselves in Gothenburg {{and how they can}} attract more customers but still keep the regulare ones. A survey was handed out and answered by the companys customers to see how they perceive the company and their tailoring services. This study showed that the customers are very happy with the company but some customers are not satisfied. The conclusion is that the company must take care of these dissatisfied customers and listen to their arguments since dissatisfied customers can create a <b>badwill</b> but mouth-to-mouth. A few of the recommendations made is to make the waiting area more pleasurable for customers and making it easier for the customers to find the tailoring company...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} some {{results of the}} research on the unemployed in Lodz, done in the middle of 1993. On the base of respondents answers, there has been made an attempt to reconstruct and typologise the perceptional and interpretational patterns of the unemployment, used by the respondents. The predominant attitutde in the situation of being unemployed is a strong frustration and making claims for special benefits, and the lower level of objectivity and constructionism. Respondents’ answers also proves that there are few interpretative stereotypes of unemployment in unemployed consciousness. Some of them see the causes of unemployment as <b>badwill</b> or incompetence of authorities or withdrawal from the idea of socialism. Such a stereotyping is typical from respondents with lower educational level. Other interpretational stereotypes, usually from respondents with high school or university education, criticise slow progress in the building of the free market economy and unsalisfactionary support of the unemployed activity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to gain a better {{understanding}} of how and why firms in the brewing industry sponsor sports events. The thesis attempts to describe, explore and starts to explain the different objectives that brewing companies have with their brands’ sports sponsorship, the selection of what sports the brands should sponsor, the evaluation methods connected to the brewing brands’ sports sponsorship involvement, as well as the perceived advantages and disadvantages of sports sponsorship. To be able to reach the {{purpose of this}} thesis, qualitative case studies on two Swedish corporate brands and two Finnish product brands have been conducted, namely, Åbro and Herrljunga Cider, as well as Lapin Kulta and KOFF. The study shows that the most common objectives for brewing brands sponsoring sports are to build and support a positive brand image, position the brand, create or increase the visibility of the brand, as well as reach a specific target market. Moreover, results show that the possible image association potential is the most significant sports selection criterion, and that the evaluation of sports sponsorship is perceived as difficult and primarily conducted through media coverage measurements. Finally, the research reveals that the advantages of sports sponsorship are several, whereas only one major disadvantage, the risk for <b>badwill,</b> is perceived. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|The {{uncertainty}} {{of the future of}} a firm has to be modelled and incorporated into the evaluation of companies outside their explicit period of analysis, i. e., in the continuing or terminal value considered within valuation models. However, there is a multiplicity of factors that influence the continuing value of businesses which are not currently being considered within valuation models. In fact, ignoring these factors may cause significant errors of judgment, which can lead models to values of goodwill or <b>badwill,</b> far from the substantial value of the inherent assets. Consequently, these results provided will be markedly different from market values. So, why not consider alternative models incorporating life expectancy of companies, as well as the influence of other attributes of the company {{in order to get a}} smoother adjustment between market price and valuation methods? This study aims to provide a contribution towards this area, having as its main objective the analysis of potential determinants of firm value in the long term. Using a sample of 714 listed companies, belonging to 15 European countries, and a panel data for the period between 1992 and 2011, our results show that continuing value cannot be regarded as the current value of a constant or growth perpetuity of a particular attribute of the company, but instead be according to a set of attributes such as free cash flow, net income, the average life expectancy of the company, investment in R&D, capabilities and quality of management, liquidity and financing structure. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|When buying {{enterprises}} as {{a property}} complex, firm-the buyer {{can pay for}} it as excess cost of the acquired entity on its balance sheet, and an amount less than {{the value of the}} assets on the balance sheet of the acquiree. Based on the requirements of the Russian legislation, in the account of the buyer acquires an intangible asset that distinguishes the Russian from the international practice. International financial reporting standards do not recognize goodwill an intangible asset of the buyer enterprise. Therefore, it is necessary to specify the Russian practice of accounting transactions in the purchase of enterprises as property complex. The article presents a definition of the property complex, based on the requirements of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, highlighted the stages of transfer of the property complex of the specified accounting documents that must be decorated, the analysis of the approaches of domestic and foreign authors to the recognition and measurement of goodwill, studied the specificity of the requirements of the Russian normative-legislative acts to the category “goodwill”, “intangible asset”. Based on the requirements of the Russian legislation, a positive goodwill is recognized in intangible asset (goodwill), in contrast to the negative goodwill (<b>badwill),</b> which immediately applies on other income of the organisation – the buyer of the enterprise – a property complex. On the positive business reputation, then the requirements of the Russian legislation, a positive goodwill is recognized intangible asset. In this paper, the authors proposed a model accounting for the purchase of enterprise as property complex as a result of which the acquisition price of an enterprise as a property complex exceeds its carrying amount of the assessment, therefore, in accounting, the buyer acquires an intangible asset {{in the form of a}} positive business reputation, compiled and substantiated recommended to reflect this fact of financial and economic activities of the correspondence of accounts...|$|E
