Theoretical research was based on numerical simulations, conducted using finite element method. The software Simufact was applied for calculations needs. During simulations, kinematics of material flow, strain intensity distribution, damage criterion according to Cockroft-Latham and temperature distributions were determined. Force parameters in the process were also determined and limiting phenomena were identified. Results from FEM modeling were verified in laboratory conditions. <b>Ball</b> <b>pins</b> hollow forgings forming tests were performed in a special forge aggregate.

40|$|Nitrocarburised H 13 disks {{were tested}} in dry, sliding wear against a {{stationary}} ruby <b>ball</b> (<b>pin).</b> Three different 4 h nitrocarburising treatments were compared, using N 2 /NH 3 /CO 2, N 2 /NH 3 /natural gas and N 2 /NH 3 gas mixtures, resulting in compound layers of varying thickness, hardness, porosity and oxide morphology. During mild, oxidative wear, {{with the formation of}} abrasive wear debris, the most brittle and oxidised surfaces performed poorly. Polishing to a bright, reflective finish greatly reduced wear. However, the N 2 /NH 3 /CO 2 sample also frequently maintained a 2 ̆ 7 very mild 2 ̆ 7 wear regime, owing to the formation of a protective film between the wear surfaces, and resulting in a lowering of the friction coefficient. This treated surface was porous and covered in a complex layer of coarse oxide+epsi-carbonitride. Nitrocarburised samples and wear tracks were characterised by optical microscopy, SEM, atomic force microscopy and stylus profilometry. <br /...|$|E

40|$|N/AIn this work, {{precipitation}} hardening (PH) stainless steel was plasma nitrided at low temperatures 400 oC and 425 oC for 15 h. The wear and corrosion-wear behaviour of the untreated and nitrided specimens were investigated under both dry sliding and wet sliding (in 3 % NaCl solution) conditions, using both one-dimensional (1 D) and two-dimensional (2 D) reciprocating motions. The 2 D motion was realised by reciprocating the sample stage {{as the primary}} motion {{and at the same}} time reciprocating the <b>ball</b> (<b>pin)</b> holder at a high frequency and small amplitude as the secondary motion. The results show that 2 D sliding has significant effects on the wear behaviour of the test specimens. Under dry condition, 2 D sliding leads to a significant increase in wear volume by 70 % to 230 %. Nitriding is very effective in increasing dry sliding wear resistance of the steel under both 1 D and 2 D conditions, with 400 oC nitriding being the most effective. Under corrosion-wear (tribocorrosion) condition in 3 % NaCl solution, 2 D sliding leads to a more significant drop in open circuit potential (OCP) and a more significant increase in anodic current than 1 D sliding. While under 1 D sliding condition, nitriding is effective in reducing material removal by tribocorrosion, under 2 D sliding condition, the effectiveness of nitriding is dependent on nitriding temperature. Nitriding at 425 oC results in accelerated material removal during 2 D sliding in the corrosive solution. The mechanisms of material removal are discussed in terms of the structures of the nitride layers and their electrochemical response to the corrosive solution...|$|E

50|$|Law 15.2.6 clarifies {{that the}} holding the ball rules {{should not be}} {{interpreted}} any differently if the tackler holds the football {{to the body of}} the player in possession of the ball. In this scenario, the player with the <b>ball</b> <b>pinned</b> to him is still required to correctly dispose of the ball if he is tackled with prior opportunity, or must make a genuine attempt to dispose of the ball if tackled without prior opportunity, to avoid conceding a free kick; the fact that the actions of the tackler make it impossible for him to effect a disposal does not change these requirements.|$|R

The by-laws governing the rule on the regulations of the <b>balls,</b> <b>pins,</b> and alleys were updated several times through his efforts. From time to time various bowling associations that Thompson worked with eventually joined the ABC and followed their by-laws.|$|R
25|$|In each of {{the first}} nine boxes, play {{proceeds}} as follows: The first player bowls his first <b>ball</b> at the <b>pins.</b> The pins he knocks down are counted and scored. Then the player rolls a second and a third ball at any remaining targets. If all ten pins are knocked down with the first ball (a strike), the player receives ten points plus the count on the next two rolls, the pins are cleared, a new set placed. If all ten pins are knocked down with two balls (a spare), the player receives 10 points plus the count of the next <b>ball,</b> <b>pins</b> are cleared and reset. If all three balls are needed to knock all the pins down, the score for that frame is simply ten, and known in New England as a ten-box. If more than one player is playing on the same lane at the same time, bowlers will typically roll two complete boxes before yielding the lane to the next bowler.|$|R

Two large rotating wheels, at the center rear of the unit, are situated with their common axis along the bowling lane. The ball-lift wheel is the one closer to the bowler and is smooth on its inside surfaces, with enough space between its inner and outer surfaces to allow the fallen pins to go rearwards through it into the rear-located pin-wheel (or pin elevator), placed behind the ball return wheel which has seven pockets, which capture the pins, and is somewhat similar to the AMF unit's design.|$|R
