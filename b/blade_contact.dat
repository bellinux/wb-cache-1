50|$|The idea of {{treading}} {{down the}} sword {{is a very}} simple technique. Squashing an enemy's attack before it starts by using a form of charging and then attacking under the veil of gunpowder smoke, and arrow fire, the initial attacks used when starting battles can be highly effective. Individually, it refers to attacking the enemy's sword, breaking it, removing it from play, and a technique of controlling it through direct blade on <b>blade</b> <b>contact.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A parry is a {{defensive}} action {{made with the}} weapon to prevent an offensive action from landing. In practice, even a light <b>blade</b> <b>contact</b> is often sufficient to prevent an attack from landing, {{so long as it}} is not a [...] "mere grazing of the blades" [...] (as expressed in the rules). Therefore, it is not necessary for a parry to [...] "close the line" [...] (an [...] "opposition parry"), though that may be used for tactical purposes. Consequently, foilists often parry with a sharp beating motion which does not necessarily end in a guard position that closes a line. In sabre, according to the FIE rules, [...] "the parry is properly carried out when, before the completion of the attack, it prevents the arrival of that attack by closing the line in which that attack is to finish". In practice, sabre referees tend to look at the point of blade contact: contact of a defender's forte with an attacker's foible is generally counted as a parry, whereas contact of a defender's foible with an attacker's forte is incorrectly executed, and priority stays with the attacker. Some fencers refer to a retreat that makes an attack fall short as a [...] "distance parry", but this is informal use: an actual parry requires <b>blade</b> <b>contact.</b>|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{the other}} two weapons, {{there is very little}} {{difference}} between an electric sabre and a steam or dry (non-electric) one. The blade itself is the same in steam and electric sabres, as {{there is no need for}} a blade wire or pressure-sensitive tip in an electric sabre. An electric sabre has a socket, which is generally a 2-prong or bayonet foil socket with the two contacts shorted together. The electric sabre also has insulation on the pommel and on the inside of the guard to prevent an electrical connection between the sabre and the lamé. This is undesirable because it effectively extends the lamé onto the sabre, causing any <b>blade</b> <b>contact</b> to be registered as a valid touch.|$|E
5000|$|The nihontō's razor-edge was so {{hard that}} upon hitting an equally hard or harder object, such as another sword's edge, {{chipping}} became a definite risk. As such, blocking an oncoming blow blade-to-blade was generally avoided. In fact, evasive body maneuvers were preferred over <b>blade</b> <b>contact</b> by most, but, if such was not possible, the flat or {{the back of the}} blade was used for defense in many styles, rather than the precious edge. A popular method for defeating descending slashes was to simply beat the sword aside. In some instances, an [...] "umbrella block", positioning the blade overhead, diagonally (point towards the ground, pommel towards the sky), would create an effective shield against a descending strike. If the angle of the block was drastic enough, the curve of the nihontō's blade would cause the attacker's blade to slide along its counter and off to the side.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was too {{determine}} whether there were significant kinematic differences between recreational and elite hockey players and between contra-lateral lower limbs during forward hockey skating. Methods. While skating on a hockey treadmill subjects were filmed with four synchronized digital video cameras while wearing reflective marker triads on the thighs, shanks and skates. Subjects skated within a calibrated volume at a self selected speed that they could maintain comfortably for one minute. Each subject completed three trials separated by 5 minutes of rest. Data was reduced and analyzed using programs written in MATLAB. Two-way ANOVA and Tukey Post Hoc tests were used to determine statistic significance. Results. Elite and recreational subjects were significantly different (p≤ 0. 05) during knee abduction and knee rotation at push off, as well as during knee abduction and knee flexion at <b>blade</b> <b>contact.</b> Contra lateral lower limbs were significantly different (p≤ 0. 05) during ankle abduction and hip rotation at <b>blade</b> <b>contact</b> as well as during knee abduction at push off. Conclusion. Some aspects of the skating stride are similar in elite and recreational hockey skaters but there were several kinematic differences between skill levels and contra-lateral legs. The skating kinematics of elite hockey players may serve as a model for young hockey players and recreational hockey players, helping them develop a more efficient and effective stride...|$|E

40|$|Although {{few studies}} have been {{conducted}} to directly quantify ichthyoplanktonmortality at hydroelectric installations, there is a considerable body of literature on examinationsof the various stresses (i. e., pressure changes, <b>blade</b> <b>contact,</b> shear) that could affect turbineentrainedeggs and larvae. A review of these studies suggests that turbine-passage mortality ofearly life stages of fish normally would be relatively low at the low-head, propeller-type turbineinstallations (e. g., bulb or STRAFLO turbines), for which relevant design information is available. The shear forces and pressure changes in low-head bulb turbines are unlikely to causeichthyoplankton mortality. Probability of contact with turbine blades is related to size of the fish;less than 5 % of entrained ichthyoplankton would be affected.

The objective is to propose a characterization and a numerical modeling methodology that could easily be integrated within an industrial process.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the {{influence}} parameters for the wiper- windscreen friction, a test system was built, using an assembly of a car plane auto rear window glass, with the electrical motor, the wiper mechanism and also a wiper with a modified arm (by inserting a transducer to measure the friction force, based on tensometric strain gauges). Also on the wiper arm, {{on the opposite side}} of the arm/blade connection (located approximatelly at the middle of the blade length) a loading system was mounted. Different loading forces can be applied to the <b>blade</b> <b>contact</b> by gravity by simple changing the mass placed on this system. A large number of experiments were performed for different combinations of the values for the blade oscillating period and for the normal force in dry and wetted conditions for the blade-windscreen contact. The obtained results, reveal a direct correlation of the friction force with the load mass and with the relative speed in the contact (blade moving period). A higher friction occurs for the dry contact. This force has a higher increasing tendency for this contact than for the wetted contact when a stabilisation tendency of the friction force occurs...|$|E
40|$|In {{hydropower}} systems, it {{is essential}} to avoid catastrophic failures that leads to human and economic losses. Unfortunately, the rotor can behave abnormally since several nonlinear effects occur during start-up, shut downs or when running at nominal speed. Weak nonlinear interaction in the tilting pad bearings, electromagnetic interaction between the generator and rotor or fluid-structure interaction in turbines are typical nonlinear effects that appear. Moreover, strong nonlinearities can also occur due to blade contacts and assembly errors. These types of nonlinearities can be strong in case of bad design of the rotor, and it could even lead to catastrophes in the worst case. Due to the complexity of the <b>blade</b> <b>contact</b> nonlinearity, it is first necessary to evaluate the general properties of the system using a simple model such as the Jeffcott rotor. Studies of nonlinearities are performed using common tools such as Poincare sections, bifurcation diagrams, Maximum Lyapunov Exponent, Lyapunov Spectrum and 3 -dimensional plots of the Fast Fourier Transform. The results obtained are also compared with an experimental rig to validate the models proposed. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to real hydropower systems with complex geometry. A focus is made on the numerical methods to employ as well as reduction methods to gain computation time. The aim is to verify that the inherent properties of simple bladed are also present in complex systems. Further numerical simulations of the system at nominal speed will be studied as function of unbalance forces and damping properties. In this case, the tools used in simple rotors system can help us evaluate under which conditions a catastrophic failure can be avoided in any hydropower system.
