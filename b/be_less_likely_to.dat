50|$|When {{examining}} these MIDs in more detail, the inter-liberal disputes have on {{the average}} more hostility, but <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> involve third parties, hostility <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reciprocated, when reciprocated the response is usually proportional to the provocation, and the disputes <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> cause any loss of life.|$|R

5|$|Some anti-bathhouse activists {{argue that}} these {{measures}} are not enough, especially given that {{it is virtually impossible}} to monitor sexual activity in a bathhouse; however, while they acknowledge that closing gay bathhouses may force some men into unsafe or illegal situations in public parks and lavatories, they point out that they may <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> engage in anal or multipartner sexboth of which put participants at risk for contracting STDsin such situations.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes {{and social}} {{stereotypes}} can create {{barriers to the}} detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This {{is more of a}} barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} assumption that plug-in recharging {{will take place}} overnight at home, residents of cities, apartments, dormitories, and townhouses do not have garages or driveways with available power outlets, and they might <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> buy plug-in electric vehicles unless recharging infrastructure is developed. Electrical outlets or charging stations near their places of residence, in commercial or public parking lots, streets and workplaces are required for these potential users to gain the full advantage of PHEVs, {{and in the case}} of EVs, to avoid the fear of the batteries running out energy before reaching their destination, commonly called range anxiety. Even house dwellers might need to charge at the office or to take advantage of opportunity charging at shopping centers. However, this infrastructure is not in place and it will require investments by both the private and public sectors.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam {{is among}} about 35 benzodiazepines {{currently}} used medically, and was synthesised in 1975 by Walser and Fryer at Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc in the United States. Owing to its water solubility, {{it was found}} to <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> cause thrombophlebitis than similar drugs. The anticonvulsant properties of midazolam were studied in the late 1970s, but not until the 1990s did it emerge as an effective treatment for convulsive status epilepticus. , {{it is the most}} commonly used benzodiazepine in anesthetic medicine. In acute medicine, midazolam has become more popular than other benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, because it is shorter lasting, is more potent, and causes less pain at the injection site. Midazolam is also becoming increasingly popular in veterinary medicine due to its water solubility.|$|E
5|$|When compared, Black signers {{were more}} likely than were White signers to produce signs outside of the typical signing space and to use two-handed signs. Adverbs are most likely to use a larger signing space. Less marked forms, such as pronouns, determiners, plain verbs, and nouns, tend to <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be {{produced}} outside the typical signing space. The selection of two-handed signs over one-handed signs was found to have systematic constraints on their production. When the sign could be produced with one or two hands, Black signers often produced the variant that matched the handedness of the following sign; if the following sign was two-handed, they {{were more likely}} to produce a two-handed variant, while if the following sign was one-handed, {{they were more likely to}} produce the one-handed variant. The use of innovative one-handed forms, though, even in environments which favored them, did not exceed 50 percent.|$|E

5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{stands in}} {{semantic}} contrast with defensive mimicry, {{where it is}} the prey {{that acts as a}} mimic, with predators being duped. Defensive mimicry includes the well-known Batesian and Müllerian forms of mimicry, where the mimic shares outward characteristics with an aposematic or harmful model. In Batesian mimicry, the mimic is modeled on a dangerous (usually unpalatable) species, while in Müllerian mimicry both species are harmful, and act as comimics, converging on a common set of signals and sharing the burden of 'educating' their predators. Also included in defensive mimicry is the lesser known Mertensian mimicry, where the mimic is more harmful than the model, and Vavilovian mimicry, where weeds come to mimic crops through unintentional artificial selection. In defensive mimicry, the mimic benefits by avoiding a harmful interaction with another organism that {{would be more likely to}} take place without the deceptive signals employed. Harmful interactions might involve being eaten, or pulled out of the ground as a weed. In contrast, the aggressive mimic benefits from an interaction that would <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> take place without the deception, at the expense of its target.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, a joint {{study by}} Manhattan College and the New York State Water Resources Institute found {{high levels of}} human fecal {{bacteria}} in the water, likely due to municipal wastewater. All 12 sites exceeded the state maximum of a monthly median of 200 organisms per 100 milliliters (ml) over five months. Levels were, as {{with most of the}} river's other pollutants, generally the highest near the mouth. However, the uppermost sampling site in the study, at the Chappaqua Metro-North station recorded the greatest single reading of any site, 1.2 × 10 organisms per 100 ml, as well as the second-highest; the researchers speculated that this was due to sewer overflow in the area at the times of those readings. Most of the high coliform readings came after rainfall except at the two sites furthest downstream; the study theorized that some older buildings in this area of Yonkers may still discharge sewage directly to the river. Since most of the Saw Mill River flows under the shade of a forest canopy, the bacteria may <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be inactivated by sunlight than in other streams.|$|E
5|$|Personal traits such as age, gender, location, and {{education}} correlate, either positively or negatively, with HIV/AIDS awareness levels. For example, older women have demonstrated {{higher levels of}} knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS than younger women in Malawi. Because men typically have greater access to education and other social resources, they are often more knowledgeable about HIV prevention and transmission than women. While men are, on average, able to list 2.2 ways to prevent HIV transmission, women are only able to list 1.5 ways. Only 38% of women surveyed in 2003-2004 understood that their husbands would <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> contract HIV if they used condoms during intercourse with prostitutes and other women from high-risk groups. In addition, men who are raised in urban environments are, on average, more informed about HIV/AIDS than men who are raised in rural environments, presumably because urban children typically have greater access to educational resources than rural children. Among both men and women, higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about HIV/AIDS: {{men and women who}} have received secondary school educations are significantly more likely to understand complex aspects of the disease, such as the fact that people who appear healthy can still be HIV-positive, than those who have not. Finally, people who have lost friends or family members to the disease are likely to have greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS due to their personal, firsthand exposure to the problem.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} half of DSPD {{patients}} are not depressed indicates that DSPD {{is not merely a}} symptom of depression.

25|$|Mass extinctions {{are thought}} to result when a {{long-term}} stress is compounded by a short term shock.

25|$|Another {{point of}} view put forward in the Escalation {{hypothesis}} predicts that species in ecological niches with more organism-to-organism conflict will <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> survive extinctions.
