5|$|C. c. capellanus (P.L. Sclater, 1877) {{is known}} as the Mesopotamian crow or Iraqi pied crow. This {{distinctive}} form occurs in Iraq and southwestern Iran.

5|$|Like most crows, {{they will}} {{scavenge}} at landfills, scattering garbage in the process. Where available, corn, wheat {{and other crops}} are a favorite food. These habits have historically caused the American crow to <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> nuisance. However, it is suspected that the harm to crops is offset by the service the American crow provides by eating insect pests.|$|E

5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of DNA sequences suggests that V.surrecta {{belongs to the}} Volvariella pusilla group—a grouping of related Volvariella species that produce small, white fruit bodies. In this analysis, V.surrecta formed a subclade with V.hypopithys. Almost 90 years earlier, Paul Konrad and André Maublanc recognized the relatedness of these species, and proposed that V.surrecta should <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> subspecies of V.hypopithys.|$|E

5|$|A {{cause and}} effect {{methodology}} led to a relatively value-free approach to economic science, in which Cantillon was uninterested in the merit of any particular economic action or phenomenon, focusing rather on the explanation of relationships. This led Cantillon to separate economic science from politics and ethics {{to a greater degree}} than previous mercantilist writers. This has led to disputes on whether Cantillon can justly <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> mercantilist or one of the first anti-mercantilists, given that Cantillon often cited government-manipulated trade surpluses and specie accumulation as positive economic stimuli. Others argue that in instances where Cantillon is thought to have supported certain mercantilist policies, he actually provided a more neutral analysis by explicitly stating possible limitations of mercantilist policies.|$|E
5|$|A frontal trough moved eastward off {{the southeastern}} United States on September30, {{becoming}} stationary north of Haiti. The trough developed {{an area of}} disturbed weather that interacted with an upper-level low pressure area, resulting {{in the development of}} a subtropical depression on October7. Upon formation, the system consisted of a very broad subtropical low, as well as a poorly defined surface circulation. As the subtropical depression drifted westward, it became further organized. By midday on October8, an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft flight indicated that the subtropical depression intensified and acquired enough tropical characteristics to <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center named the storm Josephine.|$|E

5|$|A musical {{instrument}} is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound can <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> {{musical instrument}}—it is through purpose {{that the object}} becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments {{may have been used}} for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors can {{potentially}} {{increase the risk of}} developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August11. Associated deep convection quickly decreased after tracking westward through the tropical Atlantic Ocean, although by August13 a broad low pressure area and closed circulation developed along the wave. Environmental conditions favored tropical development, and the system gradually became better organized, although convection was initially limited near the center. On August 14, convection increased northwest of the center and became sufficiently well-organized for the system to <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression; at the time, it was located about 1500miles (2400km) east of the southern Windward Islands.|$|E

If the purpose was to benefit the environment then it <b>was</b> <b>considered</b> <b>an</b> environmental innovation.

This may seem self-explanatory but for a number of stories this clear and direct method of discerning the type of innovation was necessary as some cases included both.|$|R
