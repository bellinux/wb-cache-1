5|$|The fair {{planners}} {{also sought}} two other properties near {{the southwest corner}} of the grounds. They failed completely to make any inroads with the Seattle Archdiocese of the Roman Catholic Church, who had recently built Sacred Heart Church there; they did a <b>bit</b> <b>better</b> with the Freemasons' Nile Temple, which they were able to use {{for the duration of the}} fair and which then returned to its previous use. It served as the site of the Century 21 Club. This membership organization, formed especially for the fair, charged $250 for membership and offered lounge, dining room, and other club facilities, as well as a gate pass for the duration of the fair. The city ended up leasing the property after the fair and in 1977 bought it from the Masons. The building was eventually incorporated into a theater complex including the Seattle Children's Theatre.|$|E
5|$|Eleusis is {{probably}} Abbott's most prominent game, {{due to its}} metaphors and its suitability {{for use as a}} teaching tool. He invented it in 1956, and it appeared in his self-published book Four New Card Games. It was also published in the book Abbott's New Card Games a year later. Martin Gardner wrote about it in his Mathematical Games column in the June1959 issue of Scientific American. Basically, the gameplay consists of the dealer choosing a secret rule dictating how cards are to be played, and the players playing cards in an attempt to figure out the rule through inductive reasoning. In 1973, Abbott decided to improve Eleusis; the result was considered to be far better than the original, with various improvements to the layouts and gameplay making it work quite a <b>bit</b> <b>better.</b> Martin Gardner wrote about this version in the October1977 issue of Scientific American. Abbott also self-published a pamphlet in 1977 with the rules for the improved version, titled The New Eleusis. It has appeared in several card game collections, such as Hoyle's Rules of Games and New Rules for Classic Games, among others.|$|E

25|$|Ambient air, of course, was the {{original}} machining coolant. Compressed air, supplied through pipes and hoses from an air compressor and discharged from a nozzle aimed at the tool, is sometimes a useful coolant.

25|$|The {{following}} season, {{things got}} a <b>bit</b> <b>better</b> for the Cents in the standings. Although they finished {{last in the}} Interior Division yet again, they managed to avoid the league basement. Merritt went 26–38–2, ending up well ahead of the last place Nanaimo Clippers. Zelinski continued his torrid scoring pace, finishing fifth in league scoring with 50 goals, 61 assists, and 111 points in 66 games.

25|$|As expected, {{the first}} three games of the series were tight-checking, low-scoring {{contests}} featuring stellar goaltending {{at both ends of}} the ice. Niittymaki, however, who was just a little <b>bit</b> <b>better</b> than Lehtonen, earned a surprise 1–0 shutout victory in Game 1. He was even better in Game 2, however, holding the high-scoring Wolves to just one goal in a 2–1 double overtime victory to send the series back to Philadelphia where the next three games—if necessary—would be played and where the Phantoms were already 11–0 in the playoffs. Niittymaki again held the Wolves to just one goal as the Phantoms defeated Chicago again, 2–1, in Game 3. Through almost 11 periods of hockey over three games, Niittymaki had allowed the Wolves, who had scored 245 regular season goals, just two goals while Lehtonen and had been solved for just five by the Phantoms. The differential of three goals, however, was enough to give Philadelphia a 3–0 stranglehold on the series going into Game 4 on June 10.|$|E

25|$|European {{migration}} to Australia {{began with the}} British convict settlement of Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788. The First Fleet comprised 11 ships carrying 775 convicts and 645 officials, members of the crew, marines, {{and their families and}} children. The settlers consisted of petty criminals, second-rate soldiers and a crew of sailors. There were few with skills needed to start a self-sufficient settlement, such as farmers and builders, and the colony experienced hunger and hardships. Male settlers far outnumbered female settlers. The Second Fleet arrived in 1790 bringing more convicts. The conditions of the transportation was described as horrific and worse than slave transports. Of the 1,026 convicts who embarked, 267 (256 men and 11 women) died during the voyage (26%); a further 486 were sick when they arrived of which 124 died soon after. The fleet was more of a drain on the struggling settlement than of any benefit. Conditions on the Third Fleet, which followed {{on the heels of the}} Second Fleet in 1791, were a <b>bit</b> <b>better.</b> The fleet comprised 11 ships. Of the more than 2000 convicts brought onto the ships, 173 male convicts and 9 female convicts died during the voyage. Other transport fleets bringing further convicts as well as freemen to the colony would follow. By the end of the penal transportation in 1868, approximately 165,000 people had entered Australia as convicts.|$|E

Meslow also said that Gabe Reyes was [...] "a welcome addition, successfully recognizing and calling out anything that seems like bullshit." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick at ScreenCrush said the episode was easily the best of the season so far, though he was still [...] "on the fence as to whether Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has the clearest sense of where Season 4 is going". Fitzpatrick noted that Lucy had [...] "inarguably [...] the weakest element" [...] of the season and was not surprised with the Morrow reveal, and questioned the series' stance on the morality of the Ghost Rider, feeling that it should have been made more clear.

He dismissed accusations that Liverpool were boring, rather describing his team as difficult to beat. Owen, the match winner, felt he answered his critics by scoring left-footed: [...] "It's nice to prove people wrong when they say you haven't got a left foot. I {{was supposed to be the}} worst header and the worst player with my left foot in the league, and how could an England player play when they haven't got a left foot....

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, Sickels {{augmented}} his scouting {{report on}} Kinsler by reporting that he was: a good athlete, not super-toolsy, but strong for his size with speed a notch above average. His swing looked short, quick, and sharp. Although I'm told that some people worry that his swing is too long, it looked fine to me. [...] "Long swings" [...] usually show up in the stat line as excessive strikeout totals, but Kinsler is not a whiff king. He works the count well, controlling the strike zone without trouble and not swinging at pitches outside the plate area. His bat has some pop in it, particularly to the gaps, where he rifles frequent extra-base shots. He already has above-average power for a player his size, and I think he has enough bat speed to keep hitting home runs at higher levels. Defensively, he shows slightly above-average range and good hands. His arm strength is average, but he's accurate with his throws and seems fundamentally sound, although his error rate is higher than ideal (20 in 71 games at Frisco). He might end up at second base eventually. Kinsler's running speed is a <b>bit</b> <b>better</b> than average, but he's fairly aggressive on the bases and will steal if the opportunity is there. Overall, he is a solid all-around player who makes the most of his natural ability.|$|E

Overall, the episode was given a 7 out of 10 rating. Sam McPherson, writing for Zap2it, called [...] "Night Terrors" [...] the [...] "worst episode of series 6 so far" [...] that was an [...] "incoherent mess of an episode that was utterly unenjoyable" [...] and gave it an overall grade of a C+. He criticised the idea to follow up a story arc-heavy episode with a standalone one, as he felt it [...] "served as a speed bump for the forward momentum started in [...] "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] and continued through [...] "Let's Kill Hitler". He thought that its [...] "biggest flaw" [...] was that George was sidelined in favour of Alex, which missed an opportunity to make it a story [...] "about little boys overcoming fear and fighting off the monsters in their closets".

40|$|A {{computationally}} efficient, high quality, {{vector quantization}} {{scheme based on}} a parametric probability density function (PDF) is proposed. In this scheme, speech line spectral frequencies (LSF) are modeled as i. i. d realizations of a multivariate Gaussian mixture density. The mixture model parameters are efficiently estimated using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. An efficient quantization scheme using transform coding and bit allocation techniques which allows for easy and computationally efficient mapping from observation to quantized value is developed for both fixed rate and variable rate systems. An attractive feature of this method is that source encoding using the resultant codebook involves very few searches and its computational complexity is minimal and independent of {{the rate of the}} system. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is bit scalable and can switch between memoryless and quantizer with memory seamlessly. The performance of the memoryless quantizer is 2 - 3 <b>bits</b> <b>better</b> than conventional quantization schemes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Different order modulations {{combined}} with different coding schemes, allow sending more bits per symbol, thus achieving higher throughputs and better spectral efficiencies. However, {{it must also}} be noted that when using a modulation technique such as 64 -QAM with less overhead <b>bits,</b> <b>better</b> signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are needed to overcome any Intersymbol Interference (ISI) and maintain a certain bit error ratio (BER). The use of adaptive modulation allows wireless technologies to yielding higher throughputs while also covering long distances.

This papper focusing on the physical layer design (i. e.

A comparison with the hardware approaches will be made in terms of SNR vs. BER relation...|$|R
