[...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me.

40|$|Objective – To {{determine}} if “Big Deal” journal subscription packages are a cost-effective {{way to provide}} electronic journal access to academic library users versus individual subscriptions, pay-per-view, and interlibrary loans (ILL). Design – Cost-per-article-use analysis. Setting – Public research university in the United States of America. Subjects – Cost-per-use data from 1) journals in seven <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> packages, 2) individually subscribed journals, 3) pay-per-view from publishers’ websites, and 4) interlibrary loans. Methods – The authors determined cost-per-use for <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> titles by utilizing COUNTER JR 1 metric Successful Full-Text Article Request (SFTAR) reports. Individual journal subscription cost-per-use data were obtained from individual publishers or platforms. Pay-per-view cost was determined by recording the price listed on publishers’ websites. ILL cost-per-use was established by reviewing cost-per-article obtained from libraries outside of reciprocal borrowing agreement networks. With the exception of pay-per-view numbers, title cost-per-use was averaged {{over a three-year period}} from 2010 through 2012. Main Results – Cost-per-article use for journals from <b>Big</b> <b>Deals</b> varied from 2. 11 to 9. 42. For individually subscribed journals, the average cost-per-article ranged from 0. 25 to 84. 00. Pay-per-view charges ranged from 15. 00 to 80. 00, with an average cost of 37. 72. Conclusion – The authors conclude that <b>Big</b> <b>Deals</b> are cost effective, but that they consume such a large amount of funds that they limit the purchase of other resources. The authors go on to outline the options for libraries thinking <b>about</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> packages. First, libraries should keep <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> packages in place if the average cost-per-article is less than individual subscriptions. Second, libraries could subscribe only to the most-used journals in <b>Big</b> <b>Deals,</b> cancel the packages, and rely on ILL and pay-per-view access. Third, consortia could be joined to favourably negotiate <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> package prices. Fourth, <b>Big</b> <b>Deals</b> could be dropped completely. Fifth, individual libraries armed with JR 1 reports can negotiate with publishers for bette...|$|R
