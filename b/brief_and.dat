5|$|La Grange draws {{attention}} to the notably high tessitura for the sopranos, for soloists and for choral singers. He characterises the alto solos as <b>brief</b> <b>and</b> unremarkable; however, the tenor solo role in PartII is both extensive and demanding, requiring on several occasions {{to be heard over the}} choruses. The wide melodic leaps in the Pater Profundus role present particular challenges to the bass soloist.|$|E

5|$|After 20 years, Bánáthy {{left the}} renamed Defense Language Institute {{and went to}} work for the Far West Laboratory for Research and Development in Berkeley and later San Francisco. He retired from Far West in 1989 but {{maintained}} an active interest in social systems and science, including attending many conferences and advising students and others in those fields. In 1992, he helped restart the Hungarian Scout Association within his native country. In 2003, Bánáthy and Eva moved to live with their son Tibor in Chico, California. After a <b>brief</b> <b>and</b> unexpected illness, Bánáthy died on September 4, 2003.|$|E
5|$|After Arghun's death, he was {{followed}} {{in rapid succession}} by two <b>brief</b> <b>and</b> fairly ineffective leaders, one of whom only held power for a few months. Stability was restored when Arghun's son Ghazan took power in 1295, though to secure cooperation from other influential Mongols, he made a public conversion to Islam {{when he took the}} throne, marking a major turning point in the state religion of the Ilkhanate. Despite being an official Muslim, however, Ghazan remained tolerant of multiple religions, and worked to maintain good relations with his Christian vassal states such as Cilician Armenia and Georgia.|$|E
5|$|After this, SR75 {{passes through}} the United States Naval Amphibious Base for a few miles before {{entering}} downtown Coronado. The highway becomes Orange Avenue and turns north-northeast as the main street through Coronado. SR75 intersects SR 282 at the one-way couplet of Third and Fourth Streets; SR282 continues west on Third Street and returns to SR75 on Fourth Street, while SR75 continues east on Fourth Street and heads west towards Orange Avenue on Third Street. The one-way couplet is <b>brief,</b> <b>and</b> SR75 becomes a divided highway before crossing the Coronado Bridge. While on the bridge, SR75 crosses into the city of San Diego again.|$|E

5|$|Built by J.W.Walker and Sons, {{the organ}} was {{completed}} {{only two days}} before the opening of the cathedral in 1967. Made {{as an integral part of}} the new cathedral, the architect, Frederick Gibberd, saw the casework as part of his <b>brief</b> <b>and</b> so designed the striking front to the organ. Using decorative woodwork, Gibberd was inspired by the innovative use of the pipes at Coventry Cathedral and the Royal Festival Hall and so arranged the shiny zinc pipes and brass trumpets en chamade to contrast strikingly with concrete pillars which surround the organ.|$|E

Terry Walker was chosen to play Nancy Richards, and Ben Taggart portrayed John Richards. Ray Bennett was announced to play Ed Gordon. Wheeler Oakman was cast as Fred Burns. The Simp-Phonies made a cameo appearance in the film. Then-novice actor Lloyd Bridges, who joined Columbia Pictures in 1941, also had a <b>brief</b> <b>and</b> uncredited role in the film.

5|$|Childhood was <b>brief</b> <b>and</b> perilous, {{even more}} so for girls than boys. Parents would {{celebrate}} {{the birth of a}} boy twice as much and there is some evidence of female infanticide (i.e. roadside abandonment and suffocation), though it was contrary to both civil and canon law. Educational opportunities for girls were few: they did not attend regular schools but were taught in groups at home by tutors. With few exceptions, education was limited to literacy and the Bible; a famous exception is the princess Anna Komnene (1083–1153), whose Alexiad displays a great depth of erudition, and the renowned 9th century Byzantine poet and composer Kassiani. The majority of a young girl's daily life would be spent in household and agrarian chores, preparing herself for marriage.|$|E
5|$|During December 1796 {{and early}} January 1797, the French army {{repeatedly}} attempted {{to land in}} Ireland. Early in the voyage, the frigate Fraternité carrying de Galles and Hoche, was separated from the fleet and missed the rendezvous at Mizen Head. Admiral Bouvet and General Grouchy decided to attempt the landing at Bantry Bay without their commanders, but severe weather made any landing impossible. For {{more than a week}} the fleet waited for a break in the storm, until Bouvet abandoned the invasion on 29December and, after a <b>brief</b> <b>and</b> unsuccessful effort to land {{at the mouth of the}} River Shannon, ordered his scattered ships to return to Brest. During the operation and subsequent retreat a further 11ships were wrecked or captured, with the loss of thousands of soldiers and sailors.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy is a {{group of}} {{neurological}} disorders characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from <b>brief</b> <b>and</b> nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur and as a rule, have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition.|$|E

5|$|In 1850, Cleveland's father {{moved to}} Clinton, Oneida County, New York, {{to work as}} {{district}} secretary for the American Home Missionary Society. Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, the income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school into a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and <b>brief,</b> <b>and</b> the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling {{at the completion of}} the apprentice contract. In 1853, when missionary work began to take a toll on his health, Cleveland's father took an assignment in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica) and the family moved again. Shortly after, he died from a gastric ulcer, with Grover reputedly hearing of his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.|$|E
5|$|In February 1955, Saban was {{promoted}} to head coach at Northwestern, succeeding Bob Voigts and becoming the youngest coach in the Big Ten Conference at 33 years old. Saban's tenure {{as coach of the}} Northwestern Wildcats football team, however, was <b>brief</b> <b>and</b> unsuccessful. Hampered by injuries, the team lost all of its games in 1955, and calls intensified for Saban's firing as the season wore on. In December, Saban and his entire staff were fired by new athletic director Stu Holcomb. Ara Parseghian was named as his replacement.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} Popular Contemporary Writers, Michael D. Sharp {{describes}} Vonnegut's linguistic style as straightforward; his sentences concise, his language simple, his paragraphs <b>brief,</b> <b>and</b> his ordinary tone conversational. Vonnegut uses this style to convey normally complex subject matter {{in a way}} that is intelligible to a large audience. He credited his time as a journalist for his ability, pointing to his work with the Chicago City News Bureau, which required him to convey stories in telephone conversations. Vonnegut's compositions are also laced with distinct references to his own life, notably in Slaughterhouse-Five and Slapstick.|$|E
