50|$|It is {{estimated}} that less than 7.5% of the original vegetation within Burpengary Creek catchment remains. Along the Creek there are many important tree associations {{that need to be}} conserved as only remnants of them remain. Along the coast two types of forests are evident-mangroves along the shores of Deception Bay and the tea trees and paperbark forests in the freshwater wetlands. The bulk of the catchment area includes open eucalypt forests, with vine forests / shrubs and riverline forests running sparsely {{along the edge of the}} Creek. The largest undisturbed Tea Tree and Scribbly Gum forest in south-east Queensland is located in Freshwater National Park, alongside Deception Bay Road. Other tree species found within this region are Smooth Barked Gums, Stringy <b>Barks,</b> <b>Iron</b> <b>Barks,</b> Brush Box, Hoop Pine, Cedar, Ash and Tulip Oak. Extreme care needs to be taken to preserve this vegetation to ensure that it is a safe haven for the numerous species of wildlife that lives within the Burpengary Creek catchment.|$|R

40|$|Abstract An {{interest}} in antimicrobials from new sources has expanded {{in recent years}} because of greater consumer demand for healthy foods with natural preservatives instead of chemical preservatives. Undetermined antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of novel or less-utilised spices and herbs may {{have the potential to}} fulfil consumer demands. Numerous studies have reported the antimicrobial activity of individual essential oils or plant extracts alone, however only a few have reported on the activity of combined spice and herb extracts. In addition, there is lack of knowledge on the mechanism of antimicrobial activity of spice and herb extracts. The overall aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the antimicrobial activity of less well known spices and herbs against food-borne pathogens Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus. In total, seven herbs and spices including the less-utilized goraka (Garcinia quaesita), galangal (Alpinia galanga), lemon <b>iron</b> <b>bark</b> (Eucalyptus staigerana) and mountain pepper (Tasmannia lanceolata) and the more commonly used pepper (Piper nigrum), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), and oregano (Oreganum vulgare) were extracted using ethanol, water and hexane solvents. The antimicrobial activities of these extracts were tested using disc diffusion and broth dilution assays. The total phenolic content of spice and herb extracts was assayed to establish any relationship between antimicrobial activity and phenolic compound levels. Solvent type greatly influenced the antimicrobial activity of the spice and herb extracts except for those of pepper, which had little or no activity. In particular, the hexane and ethanol extracts of galangal and ethanol and water extracts of lemon <b>iron</b> <b>bark</b> had strong antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and/or L. monocytogenes. Antimicrobial activity and phenolic compound levels was found to poorly correlated (r 2 < 0. 30), in contrast to that found by others. This indicated that the antimicrobial activity in some herb and spice extracts may be due to the presence of substances other than phenolic compounds. Three spice and herb extracts yielding the best results were selected for synergistic antimicrobial activity studies using broth dilution assay followed by viable counts. The chemical compositions of these extracts were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to provide further insight into antimicrobial constituents and their potential mechanism(s) of action. Combinations of galangal with either rosemary or lemon <b>iron</b> <b>bark</b> showed synergistic antimicrobial activity. Specifically, galangal and rosemary showed synergistic activity against S. aureus and L. monocytogenes only, while galangal and lemon <b>iron</b> <b>bark</b> showed synergistic activity against E. coli and S. Typhimurium. The major chemical components of the galangal and lemon <b>iron</b> <b>bark</b> extracts were 12 ̆ 7 -acetoxy-chavicol acetate (12 ̆ 7 ACA) (63. 4...|$|R

40|$|Two spice {{and herb}} extract {{combinations}} from galangal (Alpinia galanga), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), and lemon <b>iron</b> <b>bark</b> (Eucalyptus staigerana) were evaluated {{for their ability}} to inhibit the growth of inoculated Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus and naturally present spoilage microflora on cooked ready-to-eat shrimp stored for 16 days at 4 or 8 degrees C. A combination of galangal, rosemary, and lemon <b>iron</b> <b>bark</b> significantly reduced (P < 0. 05) levels of aerobic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria at 4 degrees C on day 12 by 1. 6 and 1. 59 log CFU/g, respectively. By day 16, levels of these bacteria were equivalent to those of controls. The shrimp treated with this spice and herb extract combination had significantly lower (P < 0. 05) lipid oxidation from day 4 to day 16. Similarly, a combination of galangal and rosemary extract significantly reduced (P < 0. 05) levels of aerobic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria at 8 degrees C on day 8 by 2. 82 and 2. 61 log CFU/g, respectively. By days 12 and 16, levels of these bacteria were equivalent to those of controls. The shrimp treated with this spice and herb combination had significantly lower (P < 0. 05) lipid oxidation on days 4 and 16. None of the spice and herb extract combinations had an effect on levels of L. monocytogenes or S. aureus or changed the color or pH of the shrimp during storage.
