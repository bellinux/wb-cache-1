5|$|Christianity {{had only}} {{recently}} arrived {{in some of these}} kingdoms. Some had <b>been</b> <b>converted</b> by the Gregorian mission, a group of Roman missionaries who arrived in Kent in 597 and who mainly influenced southern Britain.

50|$|GAs {{are usually}} {{produced}} from the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in higher plants. In this pathway, bioactive GA is produced from trans-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP). In the MEP pathway, three classes of enzymes {{are used to}} yield GA from GGDP: 1) terpene synthases (TPSs), 2) cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), and 3) 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2ODDs). There are 8 steps in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway: - 1) GGDP <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CPD) by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase - 2) etn-CDP <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-kaurene by ent-kaurene synthase - 3) ent-kaurene <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-kaurenol by ent-kaurene oxidase (KO) - 4) ent-kaurenol <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-kaurenal by KO - 5) ent-kaurenal <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-kaurenoic acid by KO - 6) ent-kaurenoic acid <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid by ent-kaurene acid oxidase (KAO) - 7) ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to GA12-aldehyde by KAO- 8) GA12-aldehyde <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to GA12 by KAO. GA12 is processed to the bioactive GA4 by oxidations on C-20 and C-3, which is accomplished by 2 soluble ODDs: GA 20-oxidase and GA 3-oxidase.|$|R
50|$|A {{small number}} of Krag-Jørgensen rifles <b>were</b> <b>converted</b> into harpoon guns, {{in the same fashion}} as Jarmann M1884s <b>were</b> <b>converted</b> to Jarmann harpoon rifles.
