5|$|A solar <b>balloon</b> {{is a black}} <b>balloon</b> that {{is filled}} with {{ordinary}} air. As sunlight shines on the <b>balloon,</b> the air inside is heated and expands causing an upward buoyancy force, much like an artificially heated hot air <b>balloon.</b> Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Balloon</b> Site, Coventry (1942) – shows a team {{of women}} {{hoisting}} a barrage <b>balloon</b> into position with the chimneys of industrial Coventry in the background surrounding the spire of Coventry Cathedral. WAAC commissioned the work as a propaganda tool to recruit women for <b>Balloon</b> Command, and Knight's composition succeeds in making the work appear both heroic and glamorous.|$|E
5|$|In late July 1861, Lowe {{inflated}} a <b>balloon</b> in Washington with {{hopes of}} providing aerial {{coverage for the}} impending Battle of Bull Run, but a violent storm buffeted the inflated <b>balloon</b> and delayed Lowe until word of the Union defeat reached him on the road. Lowe subsequently {{decided to make a}} detour to Fort Corcoran, reaching it on July 27. Over the next few days, he repeatedly ascended in the <b>balloon</b> in order to make maps of the surrounding area and gather intelligence about Confederate troops advancing on Washington.|$|E

50|$|Lindstrand <b>Balloons</b> was a {{manufacturer}} of hot air <b>balloons</b> and other aerostats. The company was started by Swedish-born pilot and aeronautical designer Per Lindstrand in Oswestry, England, as Colt <b>Balloons</b> (later Thunder & Colt <b>Balloons,</b> then Lindstrand <b>Balloons)</b> in 1978. Lindstrand <b>Balloons</b> was known for its leading-edge engineering, which included sophisticated testing and production facilities.|$|R

5|$|Later, Jan starts {{playing one}} of Frankie's CDs, but Graham {{turns it off}} to talk about money with Si and Sally. Jan takes Tamsin outside. Tamsin worries that Frankie's death is her fault because {{she asked him to}} blow up the <b>balloon.</b> She asks if Frankie's soul will go to Heaven, and Jan says that it will. Inside, Si, Sally and Graham argue about how to split the money they will make from the <b>balloon.</b> The {{argument}} gets heated after Sally argues that the fact Tamsin will soon die should preclude her from getting a share. As Graham threatens to pop the <b>balloon,</b> Jan reappears and chastises him. Tamsin, who is now considered neutral, takes the <b>balloon.</b> Graham says they should all settle down and have lunch. In the kitchen, Sally and Jan talk about Sally's work, and, in Tamsin's bedroom, Graham and Si talk about Parsons, with Si revealing that Parsons was actually unpleasant to work for. There is a loud bang from outside, and everyone goes back into the lounge, erroneously thinking that the <b>balloon</b> has burst. Graham and Si take the <b>balloon</b> to an upstairs bedroom and tuck it into a bed, while Jan turns the music back on.|$|E
5|$|Myers was {{a manager}} for the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair and the {{superintendent}} of their Aeronautic Concourse for <b>balloon</b> demonstrations and aerial races. He made <b>balloon</b> military warships and inventions {{that could be used}} for defense in case of attack by air by foreign interests and demonstrated at the Fair.|$|E
5|$|Neon is monatomic, {{making it}} {{lighter than the}} {{molecules}} of diatomic nitrogen and oxygen which form the bulk of Earth's atmosphere; a <b>balloon</b> filled with neon will rise in air, albeit more slowly than a helium <b>balloon.</b>|$|E
50|$|The major {{manufacturers}} in Canada are Sundance <b>Balloons</b> and Fantasy Sky Promotions. Other {{manufacturers in}}clude Kavanagh <b>Balloons</b> of Australia, Schroeder Fire <b>Balloons</b> of Germany, and Kubicek <b>Balloons</b> of the Czech Republic.|$|R
50|$|It is {{becoming}} more common for <b>balloons</b> {{to be filled with}} air instead of helium, as air-filled <b>balloons</b> will not release into the atmosphere or deplete the earthly helium supply. There are numerous party games and school-related activities that can use air-filled <b>balloons</b> as opposed to helium <b>balloons.</b> When age-appropriate, these activities often include the added fun of blowing the <b>balloons</b> up. In many events, the <b>balloons</b> will contain prizes, and party-goers can pop the <b>balloons</b> to retrieve the items inside.|$|R
5000|$|Toy <b>balloons</b> {{are used}} as decorations and/or {{advertising}} space. <b>Balloons</b> are usually purchased in deflated form, however some party stores and vendors at special events will fill their <b>balloons</b> before selling them, this is called [...] "balloon stuffing" [...] where the <b>balloons</b> are filled with objects such as smaller <b>balloons,</b> teddy bears, etc.|$|R
5|$|Pulmonary, or pulmonic {{stenosis}} is {{an often}} congenital narrowing of the pulmonary valve; {{it can be}} present in nasodigitoacoustic-affected infants. Treatment of this cardiac abnormality can require surgery, or non-surgical procedures like <b>balloon</b> valvuloplasty (widening the valve with a <b>balloon</b> catheter).|$|E
5|$|Soon {{afterwards}} the <b>Balloon</b> Factory {{was removed}} from the command of the Army and a new civilian superintendent, Mervyn O'Gorman, appointed. Capper remained in command of the Army <b>Balloon</b> School.|$|E

5000|$|Water <b>balloons,</b> like air <b>balloons,</b> are {{generally}} made from latex, which naturally decomposes. While there still {{could be some}} environmental impact if burst water <b>balloons</b> are {{left behind in the}} wild where animals might ingest them, that impact would be low. However, some air <b>balloons</b> are made from mylar, which does not decompose (or only extremely slowly). If mylar <b>balloons</b> are used as water bombs, then littering or leaving behind mylar <b>balloons</b> will have a much bigger environmental impact. The use of mylar <b>balloons</b> might be less problematic in closed controlled (indoor) environments where the material is subsequently collected and recycled, which is possible with mylar. (Latex <b>balloons</b> are compostable.) ...|$|R
50|$|Cluster <b>ballooning</b> {{is a form}} of <b>ballooning</b> where {{a harness}} {{attaches}} a balloonist to a cluster of helium-inflated rubber <b>balloons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The early Mogul <b>balloons</b> {{consisted}} of large clusters of rubber meteorological <b>balloons,</b> however, these were quickly replaced by enormous <b>balloons</b> made of polyethylene plastic. These were more durable, leaked less helium, and also were better at maintaining a constant altitude than the early rubber <b>balloons.</b> Constant-altitude-control and polyethylene <b>balloons</b> {{were the two}} major innovations of Project Mogul.|$|R
5|$|Swiss {{military}} aviation {{began in}} 1900with {{the creation of}} an observation <b>balloon</b> force. Swiss balloonists were first engaged in combat on 7October 1918, near the end of World War I, when a German airplane accidentally attacked a Swiss observation <b>balloon</b> stationed close to the German border and killed the observer, Lieutenant Werner Flury. The <b>balloon</b> force was eventually disestablished in 1938when developments in aviation made it obsolete.|$|E
5|$|The DC Comics edition, {{distributed}} throughout North America, contained an error on page 130, {{in which the}} lettering was removed from a speech <b>balloon.</b> The publication was shipped with a sticker of the missing text, which readers could place over the wordless <b>balloon</b> to complete the page.|$|E
5|$|The {{couple had}} still been in debt {{at the time of}} Blanchard's death, so to {{minimise}} her expenses Sophie was as frugal as possible in her choice of <b>balloon.</b> She used a hydrogen-filled gas <b>balloon</b> (or Charlière), as it allowed her to ascend in a basket little bigger than a chair, and there was no requirement for the volume of material necessary for a hot air <b>balloon.</b> A hydrogen <b>balloon</b> also freed her from having to tend a fire to keep the craft airborne. Because she was small and light, she was able to cut back on the amount of gas used to inflate the <b>balloon.</b> Sophie had used, or at least owned, a hot air balloon; Colonel Francis Maceroni recorded in his memoirs that she sold it to him in 1811 for £40.|$|E
50|$|Unmanned high-altitude <b>balloons</b> {{are used}} as Research <b>balloons.</b> Common uses include weather <b>balloons,</b> as well as {{atmospheric}} and climate research. They are also widely used to collect data and imagery from near space. High-altitude <b>ballooning</b> is used for scientific applications such as submillimetre astronomy.|$|R
50|$|A {{technical}} director worked out {{that to make}} Carl's house fly, he would require 23 million <b>balloons,</b> but Docter realized that number made the <b>balloons</b> look like small dots. Instead, the <b>balloons</b> created were made to be twice Carl's size. There are 10,927 <b>balloons</b> for shots of the house just flying, 20,622 <b>balloons</b> for the lift-off sequence, and a varying number in other scenes.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "Cloudhopper" [...] was {{originally}} coined and trademarked by British balloonist Colin Prescot. The {{development of the}} Cloudhopper {{was carried out by}} Per Lindstrand of Colt <b>Balloons</b> in 1979. Colt <b>Balloons</b> later merged with Thunder <b>Balloons</b> to form Thunder & Colt <b>Balloons,</b> which inherited the Cloudhopper name. Finally, Per Lindstrand left Thunder & Colt to form his own Lindstrand <b>Balloons,</b> which manufactures the present-day Cloudhopper.|$|R
5|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} {{accident}} {{seemed to be that}} the fireworks attached to her <b>balloon</b> had been knocked out of position by a tree as she ascended; possibly the <b>balloon</b> was heavily loaded and failed to rise quickly enough. When she had lit the fuses the fireworks headed towards the <b>balloon</b> instead of away from it; one of them burned a hole in the fabric, igniting the gas. One man reportedly spotted the problem and shouted to her not to light the fuses, but his cries were drowned out by the cheering of the crowd. Later reports suggested she had left the gas valve open, allowing sparks to ignite the gas and set fire to the <b>balloon,</b> or that her <b>balloon</b> was of poor construction and allowed gas to escape throughout the ascent.|$|E
5|$|Andrée ignored many {{early signs}} of the dangers {{associated}} with his <b>balloon</b> plan. Being able to steer the <b>balloon</b> to some extent was essential for a safe journey, and {{there was plenty of}} evidence that the drag-rope steering technique he had invented was ineffective; yet he staked the fate of the expedition on drag ropes. Worse, the polar <b>balloon</b> Örnen (The Eagle) was delivered directly to Svalbard from its manufacturer in Paris without being tested; when measurements showed it to be leaking more than expected, Andrée refused to acknowledge the alarming implications. Most modern students of the expedition see Andrée's optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for the forces of nature as the main factors in the series of events that led to his death and those of his two companions Nils Strindberg (1872–97) and Knut Frænkel (1870–97).|$|E
5|$|Critchfield left Los Alamos in 1946 and {{returned}} to George Washington University, but soon left to join Wigner at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In 1947 he became {{an assistant professor at}} the University of Minnesota, where he participated, with Edward P. Ney and John R. Winckler, in a classified project to improve <b>balloon</b> technology. Here, with Leland S. Bohl, he invented and patented the natural shape <b>balloon,</b> and participated, with Ney and his student Sophie Oleksa, in an early search for primary cosmic ray electrons.|$|E

5|$|Everyone sits in silence, {{waiting for}} Parsons's manager to arrive. Jan {{suggests}} that Graham blow up another <b>balloon</b> for Tamsin. Sally, Si and Graham realise that, {{with the camera}} footage they have, they can blow up all the purple balloons and sell them to multiple bidders. Jan screams when she sees movement in Tamsin's bedroom, and it is realised that Frankie is still alive. Jan takes Tamsin {{out of the room}} and the remaining three agree, after panicked discussion, that they should kill Frankie. Si loses a coin toss and smothers Frankie with a cushion. Later, out on the street, Frankie's body is put into an ambulance. Si says to Sally and Graham that he will be in touch and leaves. Sally and Graham discuss selling the camcorder footage, and Jan runs inside to see that Tamsin is not in her chair or room. Upstairs, Tamsin crawls onto the bed containing the <b>balloon,</b> carrying a heart-shaped helium <b>balloon.</b> On the street, Sally, Graham and Jan see Tamsin opening the upstairs window. She releases the helium <b>balloon</b> with the <b>balloon</b> containing Frankie's breath attached. The two float skyward as Graham films.|$|E
