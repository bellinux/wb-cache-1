Mark continues to film as she is raped, <b>beaten</b> <b>to</b> <b>death,</b> and beheaded. The Ya̧nomamö then pursues and kills the last two team members as the camera drops {{to the floor and}} ends showing Alan's bloody face. Disturbed by what they have seen, the executives order the footage to be destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Seizing opportunity, the Eight Banners {{crossed the}} Great Wall after the Ming border general Wu Sangui (1612–1678) opened the gates at Shanhai Pass. This {{occurred}} {{shortly after he}} learned {{about the fate of}} the capital and an army of Li Zicheng marching towards him; weighing his options of alliance, he decided to side with the Manchus. The Eight Banners under the Manchu Prince Dorgon (1612–50) and Wu Sangui approached Beijing after the army sent by Li was destroyed at Shanhaiguan; the Prince of Shun's army fled the capital on the fourth of June. On 6 June, the Manchus and Wu entered the capital and proclaimed the young Shunzhi Emperor ruler of China.

5|$|García sent captain Pedro de Zubiaur, {{his senior}} officer, on towards the lake. He arrived at Lake Petén Itza with 60 musketeers, friar San Buenaventura and another Franciscan and allied Yucatec Maya warriors. They were also {{accompanied}} by about 40 Maya porters. On 2 February the expedition {{was approached by}} two Itza warriors who told them of a recent battle between a Guatemalan expedition and the Itza; these two Itzas guided the party to a nearby Itza settlement, and the letter from Avendaño was shown to captain Zubiaur, convincing {{him that he could}} advance safely. The port town of Ch'ich' was abandoned but a large number of canoes approached, judged to be as many as 300 by the Spanish captain, bearing perhaps 2,000 Itza warriors. The warriors began to mingle freely with the Spanish party and began to load the Spanish supplies into the canoes with a promise of transporting the expedition across to Nojpetén, with one soldier in each canoe. The Franciscans readily boarded the canoes, with two soldiers as an escort. A scuffle then broke out; a dozen more of the Spanish party were forced into canoes, and two porters were <b>beaten</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> One of the captured Spanish soldiers was immediately decapitated. At this point the Spanish soldiers opened fire with their muskets, and the Itza retreated across the lake with their prisoners.|$|E
