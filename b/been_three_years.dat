The Gospel of John mentions three Passovers, and Jesus' ministry is traditionally said to have <b>been</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> long. Others claim that Jesus' ministry apparently lasted one year, possibly two.|$|E

25|$|Anti-clericalism, and {{attempting}} to divide religions by pitting laity against their hierarchy was still encouraged. Most of the clergy arrested and imprisoned in the 1920s and onwards never had trials. The maximum sentence for administrative exile in the 1920s had <b>been</b> <b>three</b> <b>years,</b> but this was extended to four years in 1934 when the NKVD was created and given the power to issue such sentences. After serving such terms, most clergy would return their dioceses. Those whose terms ran out around 1930 were often transported later under surveillance to an isolated village in the far north or north-east, never to return.|$|E

25|$|Henry Cow {{returned}} to London in early 1977, where they {{merged with the}} entire Mike Westbrook Brass Band and folk singer Frankie Armstrong to form the Orckestra. They played their first concert at the Moving Left Revue at The Roundhouse in London {{and then at the}} Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park. The Orckestra later went on to tour in France, Italy and Scandinavia (extracts from some of these performances were released in 2006 on a CD-single included in the Henry Cow Box). At {{more or less the same}} time they set up Music for Socialism and its May Festival. It had <b>been</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> since Henry Cow had performed more than one concert a year in their own country. In an attempt to break the apathy that seemed to be discouraging anyone from wanting to put them on, they tried to organise a small alternative tour themselves, but abandoned it after 11 concerts when they started losing money: clearly nothing had changed.|$|E
25|$|The Australians {{had reached}} the final after a hard fought 30–20 Semi-final win over New Zealand at the McAlpine Stadium which had gone into extra time after the score was locked at 20-all after 80 minutes. Their opponents and tournament host England, had an easier time {{defeating}} Wales 25–10 in their Semi at Old Trafford. Even though they were favoured to win, Australia went into the final having lost three of their past four games at Wembley (the only win being the World Cup final of 1992), and had already lost the opening match of the tournament there to the English. Also, due to the ARL's policy of not selecting Super League aligned players, the Kangaroos went into the game with 11 of their 17 players {{under the age of}} 24. Although considered mostly a 'second string' team without the likes of Laurie Daley, Ricky Stuart, Andrew Ettingshausen, Steve Renouf, Steve Walters and Glenn Lazarus, most of the Kangaroos had played in the 3–0 whitewash of New Zealand in the Trans-Tasman series earlier in the year. Kangaroos captain and five-eighth Brad Fittler and fullback Tim Brasher were the only members of Australia's 1992 World Cup Final win over Great Britain at Wembley, with both players in the same positions as they had <b>been</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> previously.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2015, Margera {{announced}} that he had been working on an autobiographical documentary film which he hoped to premiere in the near future. On April 9, the first trailer for the film, titled I Need Time To Stay Useless, was released to YouTube and other media outlets. The film will deal primarily with Margera's life {{after the death of his}} close friend and co-star, Ryan Dunn, who died in a car crash in 2011. According to Margera [...] the film has <b>been</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> in the making, and will give viewers a glimpse into his childhood, career and rise to fame, while focusing mainly on his recovery from the death of Dunn. Musician Brent Hinds of the band Mastodon will play Dunn in what has been described as [...] "dramatic fantasy interludes" [...] that ties the film together while also re-enacting what Margera considers his [...] "darkest moments" [...] after Dunn's death. [...] During a Facebook Q on December 7, 2015, Margera stated that the name of the film would change from I Need Time To Stay Useless to Earth Rocker and that it would be released February 2016. In the 2017 season premier of Vice's Epicly Later'd, Margera stated that after working on the film for four years straight, sometimes for weeks at a time, he had reached the point where he had had enough of doing so. Margera stated that he had approximately eleven terabytes worth of video footage and that editing it down into a two-hour film was impossible. When asked if the project was on pause for the moment, he responded that it was.|$|E

2500|$|Diddy {{described}} the Last Train to Paris as an [...] "electro-hip-hop-soul funk" [...] album which has <b>been</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> in the making. Diddy says {{the sound of}} this album was influenced [...] "by being in the dance music world and doing stuff with Felix da Housecat, Erick Morillo, Deep Dish, DJ Hell and being in Ibiza and DC10." [...] The arc will follow Diddy's character as he tours from London to Paris and finds the woman of his dreams - only to lose her, find her, lose her again and find her a final time. The records were conceptualised from Diddy's comments to his producers. He told Alex da Kid (who produced [...] "Coming Home") [...] "I want a beat {{that makes me feel}} like a white man in a basement in Atlanta." [...] Diddy said that [...] "most of the producers he worked with, he's been friends with for a long time. The records came together by hanging out with them, taking them to parties and showing them movies". In an interview with MTV News Diddy said [...] "One of the things [...] trying to represent is emotion... Not being afraid to show emotion on record. A lot of records out right now — no disrespect to them, but they're all surface. It's about what people have or a dance. All our records are gonna be about love, feelings and emotion. Last Train to Paris is a love story and the most vulnerable album I've ever been involved in. It's raw emotion — you get a feeling, a vibe." [...] Diddy also released an application for the iPhone that integrates his social networking site and Twitter feed. A short film will also accompany the album. Rap producer Bangladesh, also confirmed that he would be producing for the album. According to New York magazine, the album was [...] "assembled from 60 or so songs. The genesis of Last Train to Paris is full of odd stories involving our hero, ensconced in a darkened studio, barking batty ideas to his production team." ...|$|E
