5|$|The USCG cited topside damage as a {{reasonable}} alternative reason for Fitzgerald sinking and surmised that {{damage to the}} fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy floating object such as a log. Historian and mariner Mark Thompson believes that something broke loose from Fitzgeralds deck. He theorized {{that the loss of}} the vents resulted in flooding of two ballast tanks or a <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list. Thompson further conjectured that damage more extensive than Captain McSorley could detect in the pilothouse let water flood the cargo hold. He concluded that the topside damage Fitzgerald experienced at 3:30p.m. on November 10, compounded by the heavy seas, was the most obvious explanation for why she sank.|$|E
25|$|The first armored {{suit with}} real joints, {{designed}} as leather pieces with rings {{in the shape}} of a spring (also known as accordion joints), was designed by Englishman W. H. Taylor in 1838. The diver's hands and feet were covered with leather. Taylor also devised a <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> attached to the suit that could be filled with water to attain negative buoyancy. While it was patented, the suit was never actually produced.

The steamship SS Abangarez, owned by the United Fruit Company and captained by Master W.A. Card, was underway toward Dock No. 6 at Cristobal. Through a series of maneuvering errors and miscommunication, the SS Abangarez collided with the O-5 and struck the submarine on the starboard side of the control room, opening a hole some ten feet long and penetrating the number one main <b>ballast</b> <b>tank.</b> The submarine rolled sharply to port – then back to starboard – and sank bow first in 42 feet of water.|$|E

50|$|These {{models have}} the ability to alter their {{displacement}} by taking on or pumping out water.

40|$|Recent {{regulation}} {{mandates that}} ships conduct mid-ocean ballast water exchange (BWE) prior to discharging foreign ballast in U. S. territorial waters.

Relatively conservative elements Me, U and V provided little additional information beyond that obtained from salinity, whereas nonconservative Ba, P and Mn offered greater resolution. The utility of Ba, P and Mn was further examined {{in the context of}} three criteria: (1) stability, or whether tracers maintain stable concentrations in <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> over time; (2) fidelity, or the degree to which tracer concentrations in <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> faithfully reflect concentrations at their ocean source; and (3) predictability, or the degree to which <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> have a predictable and restricted range of tracer concentrations following BWE. We found that in water held in <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> over time, average stability increased for Mn 21 %> 3 %) and fidelity increased in the same direction. While Ba and P usually increased discrimination at high salinities, Mn was typically the most sensitive indicator of BWE and the presence of residual port water in partially exchanged tanks. Ba, P and Mn in tanks exchanged in the Atlantic exhibited different concentration ranges compared to tanks exchanged in the Pacific, suggesting that if trace elements are to be used to verify BWE, criteria for discriminating between exchanged and unexchanged <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> may need to be basin-specific.
