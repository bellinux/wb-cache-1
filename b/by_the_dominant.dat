5|$|Ocean tides are {{converted}} to heat by frictional {{losses in the}} oceans and their interaction with the solid bottom and with the top ice crust. In late 2008, it was suggested Jupiter may keep Europa's oceans warm by generating large planetary tidal waves on Europa because of its small but non-zero obliquity. This generates so-called Rossby waves that travel quite slowly, at just a few kilometers per day, but can generate significant kinetic energy. For the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree, the resonance from Rossby waves would contain 7.3 J of kinetic energy, which is two thousand times larger {{than that of the}} flow excited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> tidal forces. Dissipation of this energy could be the principal heat source of Europa's ocean.|$|E

At this early stage, the Faculty had distinguished colleagues from Cornell University and other international institutions.|$|E
25|$|Ashkelon {{was soon}} rebuilt. Until {{the conquest of}} Alexander the Great, Ashkelon's {{inhabitants}} were influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> Persian culture. It is in this archaeological layer that excavations have found dog burials. It is believed the dogs {{may have had a}} sacred role, however evidence is not conclusive. After the conquest of Alexander in the 4th century BC, Ashkelon was an important free city and Hellenistic seaport.|$|E
25|$|After the American Civil War, {{museums and}} {{galleries}} began more frequently {{to display the}} work of African-American artists. Cultural expression in mainstream venues was still limited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> European aesthetic and by racial prejudice. To increase the visibility of their work, many African-American artists traveled to Europe where they had greater freedom. It {{was not until the}} Harlem Renaissance that more European Americans began to pay attention to African-American art in America.|$|E

25|$|The ball is {{strapped}} {{into the mouth}} behind the teeth, with the straps going around the head to secure it in place.

The wearer can still be heard, but it renders their speech completely unintelligible, distorts their facial features, and causes drooling if the wearer attempts to talk.|$|E
25|$|Interspecific {{competition}} {{has been observed}} when Orcaella was forced inshore and excluded by more specialised dolphins. When captive humpback dolphins (Sonsa chinensis) and Irrawaddy dolphins were held together, reportedly the Irrawaddy dolphins were frequently chased and confined to {{a small portion of}} the tank <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> humpbacks. In Chilika Lake, local fishers say when Irrawaddy dolphins and bottlenose dolphins meet in the outer channel, the former get frightened and are forced to return toward the lake.|$|E
50|$|Fiske {{states that}} the subordinate’s ability to create {{originality}} and thus oppose <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> “results in <b>the</b> producers having to resort to the processes of incorporation or containment”. <b>By</b> reincorporating <b>the</b> differences made <b>by</b> excorporation, <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> group strips <b>the</b> subordinate group from any opposition that the latter may have created.

25|$|Pygmies {{are often}} evicted from {{their land and}} given the lowest paying jobs. At a state level, Pygmies are not {{considered}} citizens by most African states and are refused identity cards, deeds to land, health care and proper schooling. Government policies and multinational corporations involved in massive deforestation have exacerbated this problem by forcing more Pygmies out of their traditional homelands and into villages and cities where they often are marginalized, impoverished and abused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> culture.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} hundred years of Ottoman rule in Palestine, European archaeologists active in the region tended to be Christian, backed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> European powers of the time and the Churches. With the {{transition}} from Ottoman to British rule over the land, the pursuit of archaeology became less political and religious in nature and instead took on a more purely historical and scientific character. After World War I (1914–1918) and the establishment of the British Mandate, archaeological institutions tended increasingly to be concentrated in the city of Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|The Grant's gazelle is a gregarious, territorial, and migratory species. The home {{ranges of}} does overlap {{with those of}} the bucks. Only male gazelles are territorial. Male gazelles will herd all females that cross their territories. When the females are in estrus, they are {{strongly}} guarded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> male, which prevents other males from mating with them. Any doe that tries to leave is aggressively herded back. Most of the time, the buck’s simple stance in relation to her is enough to keep the female from leaving.|$|E
50|$|Also a urine {{dipstick}} {{test for}} proteinuria {{can give a}} rough estimate of albuminuria. This is because albumin is <b>by</b> far <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> plasma protein, and bromphenol blue the agent used in the dipstick is specific to albumin.|$|R

25|$|Finally, most of {{the temple}} {{decoration}} {{is the work of}} local Theban artists. This is evidenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> artistic style of the temple which represents people with large lips and eyes and thin bodies. At the opposite, the refined chapels of Mentuhotep II's wives are certainly due to Memphite craftsmen who were heavily influenced by the standards and conventions of the Old Kingdom. This phenomenon of fragmentation of the artistic styles is observed throughout the First Intermediate Period and is a direct consequence of the political fragmentation of the country.|$|E
25|$|In {{the southeastern}} {{area of the}} old town is the Hofstatt, the town’s only large open square. The Zeughaus (Armory), {{completed}} in 1673, {{is located on the}} square’s northern side. The baroque structure stands out into the alley with its protruding tower topped by a bulbous dome (an architectural design that is rarely encountered in the German-speaking section of Switzerland). The southern side of the Hofstatt is flanked <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> Salzhaus (Salt House), which was completed in 1732, and was used to store salt until the middle of the 19th century. Other than the attic space, the building is composed entirely of one large room with twelve supporting pillars.|$|E
25|$|In {{basically}} {{all major}} primate taxa, aggression is used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> males when herding females {{and keeping them}} away from other males. In hamadryas baboons, the males often bite the females’ necks and threaten them. Wild chimpanzees can charge at females, shake branches, hit, slap, kick, pound, drag, and bite them. Orangutans {{are among the most}} forceful of mammals. Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) exhibited aggression in almost 90 percent of their copulations, including when the females were not resisting. A possible explanation for aggressive behaviors in primates {{is that it is a}} way for males to train females to be afraid of them and be more likely to surrender to future sexual advances.|$|E
