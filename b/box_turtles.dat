5|$|Four genera are {{represented}} with different {{species in the}} list. Terrapene (<b>box</b> <b>turtles)</b> has Terrapene ornata (Kansas) along with Terrapene carolina (Missouri, North Carolina, and Tennessee). Under Gopherus (gopher tortoises), there are Gopherus polyphemus (Georgia's state reptile and Florida's state tortoise) and Gopherus agassizii (California and Nevada). Under Crotalus (one of two rattlesnake genera), Arizona named Crotalus willardi willardi, while West Virginia chose Crotalus horridus. With Phrynosoma (horned lizards), Wyoming specified the entire genus, but Texas specified Phrynosoma cornutum.|$|E
5|$|While most early ornithologists defended Bartram's honesty, Joel Asaph Allen {{argued that}} the painted vulture was mythical and that Bartram mixed {{elements}} of different species to create this bird. Allen {{pointed out that the}} birds' behavior, as recorded by Bartram, is in complete agreement with the caracara's. For example, Bartram observed the birds following wildfires to scavenge for burned insects and <b>box</b> <b>turtles.</b> Such behavior is typical of caracaras, but the larger and shorter-legged king vultures are not well adapted for walking. The northern crested caracara (Caracara cheriway) was believed to be common and conspicuous in Bartram's days, but it is notably absent from Bartram's notes if the painted vulture is accepted as a Sarcoramphus. However, Francis Harper {{argued that the}} bird could, as in the 1930s, have been rare in the area Bartram visited and could have been missed.|$|E
5|$|Many {{authors have}} {{described}} the prey items taken under natural circumstances. Although fish and frogs are their most common prey, they eat almost any small vertebrate. Campbell and Lamar (2004) provided an exhaustive list of species that have reportedly been preyed upon by A. piscivorus, including cicadas, caterpillars, land snails (Euglandina rosea), catfish (Ictalurus furcatus), pike (Esox ssp.), sunfishes (Lepomis ssp.), bass (Micropterus ssp.), sirens (Siren spp.), eastern newts (Notophthalmus viridescens), brook salamanders (Eurycea spp.), Ouachita dusky salamanders (Desmognathus brimleyorum), spadefoot toads (Scaphiopus), eastern narrowmouth toads (Gastrophryne carolinensis), northern cricket frogs (Acris crepitans), West Indian treefrogs (Osteopilus septentrionalis), treefrogs (Hyla spp.), true frogs (Rana spp.), green anoles (Anolis carolinensis), skinks (Eumeces spp.), eastern glass lizards (Ophisaurus ventralis), ground skinks (Scincella lateralis), mudsnakes (Farancia abacura), hog-nosed snakes (Heterodon platirhinos), kingsnakes (Lampropeltis spp.), watersnakes (Nerodia spp.), crayfish snakes (Regina spp.), brown snakes (Storeria dekayi), gartersnakes and ribbonsnakes (Thamnophis spp.), other cottonmouths (A. piscivorus), rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.), common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), mud turtles (Kinosternon spp.), common musk turtles (Sternotherus odoratus), Florida cooters (Pseudemys floridana), sliders (Trachemys scripta), eastern <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> (Terrapene carolina), Florida softshell turtles (Apalone ferox), baby American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), wood thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina), chickadees (Parus spp.), cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), unidentified passerines, small ducks, juvenile anhingas (Anhinga anhinga), common egrets (Ardea alba), egrets, glossy ibises and their eggs (Plegadis falcinellus), tricolor herons (Egretta tricolor), herons and their eggs, pied-billed grebes (Podilymbus podiceps), short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda), least shrews (Cryptotis parva), southeastern shrews (Sorex longirostris), eastern moles (Scalopus aquaticus), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), rice rats (Oryzomys palustris), hispid pocket mice (Perognathus hispidus), black rats (Rattus rattus), squirrels (Sciurus spp.), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.) and bats.|$|E

25|$|Prior to hibernation, <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> tend to move {{further into}} the woods, where they dig a chamber for overwintering. Ornate <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> dig {{chambers}} up to 50 centimeters, while Eastern <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> hibernate at depth of about 10 centimeters. The location for overwintering can be up to 0.5km from the summer habitat and is often {{in close proximity to}} that of the previous year. In more southern locations, turtles are active year-round, as has been observed for T. coahuila and T.c.major. Other <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> in higher temperatures are more active (T.c.yukatana) or only active during the wet seasons.|$|E
25|$|<b>Box</b> <b>turtles</b> can {{be injured}} by {{dogs and cats}} so special {{care must be taken}} to protect them from {{household}} pets. <b>Box</b> <b>turtles</b> require an outdoor enclosure, consistent exposure to the sun and a varied diet. Without these, a turtle's growth can be stunted and its immune system weakened.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> {{occupy a}} wide variety of {{habitats}} (which both vary on a day-to-day, season-to-season, but also species-to-species basis), a standard box turtle habitat can not be identified. Mesic woodlands are a habitat where <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> are generally found. T. ornata is the only species regularly found in grasslands, but its subspecies the desert box turtle is also found in the semidesert with rainfall predominantly in summer. The single location where Coahuilan <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> are found is a 360km2 region characterized by marshes, permanent presence of water and several types of cacti.|$|E

25|$|It is {{recommended}} to buy captive bred <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> (in areas {{where this is}} allowed) to reduce the pressure put on the wild populations. A 3-year study in Texas indicated that over 7,000 <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> {{were taken from the}} wild for commercial trade. A similar study in Louisiana found that in a 41-month period, nearly 30,000 <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> were taken from the wild for resale, many for export to Europe. Once captured, turtles are often kept in poor conditions where up to half of them die. Those living long enough to be sold may suffer from conditions such as malnutrition, dehydration, and infection.|$|E

25|$|<b>Box</b> <b>turtles</b> are North American turtles of {{the genus}} Terrapene. Although <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> are superficially similar to {{tortoises}} in terrestrial habits and overall appearance, they are actually members of the American pond turtle family (Emydidae). The twelve taxa which are distinguished in the genus are distributed over four species. They are largely characterized by having a domed shell, which is hinged at the bottom, allowing the animal to close its shell tightly to escape predators. <b>Box</b> <b>turtles</b> have become popular pets, although their needs in captivity are complex. The females usually have yellowish, brown eyes and the males usually have red or orange eyes, but the most reliable manner to distinguish males from females {{is to examine the}} plastron: on males there is a concave area centered beneath the hinge.|$|E

50|$|The Gulf Coast <b>box</b> <b>turtle</b> (Terrapene {{carolina}} major) is {{the largest}} subspecies of the North American <b>box</b> <b>turtle</b> (Terrapene carolina).|$|R
50|$|The common <b>box</b> <b>turtle</b> inhabits open woodlands, marshy meadows, floodplains, scrub {{forests and}} brushy grasslands {{in much of}} the eastern United States, from Maine and Michigan to eastern Texas and south Florida. It is found in Canada in {{southern}} Ontario and in Mexico along the Gulf Coast and in the Yucatán Peninsula. The species range is not continuous as the two Mexican subspecies, T. c. mexicana (Mexican <b>box</b> <b>turtle)</b> and T. c. yucatana (Yucatán <b>box</b> <b>turtle),</b> are separated from the US subspecies by a gap in western Texas. Three of the US subspecies; T. c. carolina (eastern <b>box</b> <b>turtle),</b> T. c. major (Gulf Coast <b>box</b> <b>turtle)</b> and T. c. bauri (Florida box turtle); occur roughly in the areas indicated by their names. T. c. triunguis (three-toed <b>box</b> <b>turtle)</b> is found in the central United States.|$|R
25|$|In {{the warmer}} summer months, common <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> {{are more likely}} to be seen near the edges of swamps or marshlands, {{possibly}} in an effort to stay cool. If common <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> do become too hot, (when their body temperature rises to around 32°C), they smear saliva over their legs and head; as the saliva evaporates it leaves them comfortably cooler. Similarly, the turtle may urinate on its hind limbs to cool the body parts it is unable to cover with saliva.|$|E
25|$|Once {{maturity}} is reached, {{the chance}} of death seems not to increase with age. The survivorship curve of <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> is therefore probably {{similar to that of}} other long-living turtles. The average life span of adult <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> is 50 years, while a significant portion lives over 100 years. The age of a growing box turtle in the wild can not be accurately estimated by counting the growth rings on the scutes; Their growth is directly affected by the amount of food, types of food, water, illness, and so much more. Box turtle eggs are flexible, oblong and are (depending on the taxon) on average 2–4cm long weighing 5-11 g. The normal clutch size is 1-7 eggs. In captivity and in the southern end of their range, <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> can have more than one clutch per year, while the average clutch size is larger in more northern populations.|$|E
25|$|Breathing during {{locomotion}} {{has been}} studied in three species, and they show different patterns. Adult female green sea turtles do not breathe as they crutch along their nesting beaches. They hold their breath during terrestrial locomotion and breathe in bouts as they rest. North American <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> breathe continuously during locomotion, and the ventilation cycle is not coordinated with the limb movements. This is because they use their abdominal muscles to breathe during locomotion. The last species to have been studied is the red-eared slider, which also breathes during locomotion, but takes smaller breaths during locomotion than during small pauses between locomotor bouts, indicating {{that there may be}} mechanical interference between the limb movements and the breathing apparatus. <b>Box</b> <b>turtles</b> have also been observed to breathe while completely sealed up inside their shells.|$|E
25|$|The common <b>box</b> <b>turtle</b> (Terrapene carolina) is {{a species}} of <b>box</b> <b>turtle</b> with six {{existing}} subspecies.
