40|$|Nafion- 1, 2, 3 -triazole blend {{membranes}} {{were prepared}} by autoclave (AC) solution processing mixing of Nafion (R) solution (5 % solution in 1 - and 2 -propanol and H 2 O) and 1, 2, 3 -triazole. The blend membranes were very flexible, transparent, homogeneous, and stable even after boiling {{in water and}} treatment in 1 M H 2 SO 4. FTIR and NMR results suggested that 1 - and 2 -propanol of Nafion solution reacted with 1, 2, 3 -triazole under the catalytic effect of the Nafion's acid side chain. IV performance of blend membranes was tested using a single membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cell. The cell performance of Nafion- 5 wt. % 1, 2, 3 -triazole <b>blend</b> <b>membrane</b> was {{higher than that of}} the Nafion 112 at cell temperatures over 100 degrees C indicating {{that it is possible to}} use Nafion- 1, 2, 3 -triazole <b>blend</b> <b>membrane</b> as an electrolyte for high temperature PEMFCs...|$|E

40|$|Fuel {{cells are}} clean and {{efficient}} energy conversion devices. The fuel cells of interest contain polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs) that inhibit the conduction of electrons and facilitate {{the transport of}} protons. Nafion® is {{the most widely used}} membrane for fuel cell applications. However, alternatives are desired because Nafion is expensive, allows significant amounts of methanol crossover, and functions poorly at low humidity or high temperature. An acid-base <b>blend</b> <b>membrane</b> composed of both acidic sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone ketone) (Ph-SPEEKK) and basic polysulfone tethered with 5 -amino-benzotriazole (PSf-BTraz) has been show to perform better than traditional acidic PEMs such as Nafion and Ph-SPEEKK. We use molecular dynamics to study the PEM morphology and the transport of water, hydronium, and methanol in Ph-SPEEKK/PSf-BTraz blend membranes. Our aim is to understand the fundamental science behind the enhanced properties of the <b>blend</b> <b>membrane.</b> Initial analysis shows that transport is slower and sulfonate groups are farther apart compared to plain Ph-SPEEKK. The decrease in methanol crossover may account for the enhanced performance Ph-SPEEKK/Psf-BTraz. Further analysis is needed to definitively relate the structure to transport properties...|$|E
40|$|Membrane fouling {{phenomenon}} {{is a major}} problem for efficient use of ultrafiltration membranes and resulted in reduction of throughput and performance. Hence, an attempt has been made to develop a low-fouling <b>membrane</b> material by <b>blending</b> polymers. Blending of polysulfone (PSU) and Pluronic F 127 was carried out to prepare membranes with hydrophilic and low-fouling property. PSU and Pluronic F 127 were blended in 100 / 0, 90 / 10 and 80 / 20 compositions using N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone (NMP) as solvent and membranes were prepared by the phase inversion technique. The membrane morphologies were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The results showed an asymmetric morphology of PSU/Pluronic F 127 membranes. The static contact angles of <b>blend</b> <b>membranes</b> were measured using a contact angle goniometer. The decrease of static water contact angle with an increase in Pluronic F 127 content indicated an increase of surface hydrophilicity. The stability of Pluronic F 127 in <b>blend</b> <b>membranes</b> was evaluated by Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (ATR-FTIR). The results analysis confirmed that Pluronic F 127 could exist stably in <b>blend</b> <b>membranes.</b> The permeation flux of pure water under different pressures was investigated. It was found that <b>blend</b> <b>membranes</b> have higher permeability than that of PSU-control membrane...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, block {{copolymer}} poly(amide- 12 -b-ethylene oxide) (Pebax 1074) /poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG 1500) <b>blend</b> <b>membranes</b> are prepared by solution casting and solvent evaporation method. According to DSC experiments, the melting temperature for PEO phase in Pebax 1074 /PEG 1500 <b>blend</b> <b>membranes</b> increases {{with the increase}} of PEG 1500 content, which will influence the gas transport properties. Compared with Pebax 1074 membrane, the gas transport through Pebax 1074 /PEG 1500 <b>blend</b> <b>membranes</b> can be divided into crystalline, transition and amorphous regions due to the temperature dependence of PEO thermal transition. And the gas permeability can be described by two different Arrhenius equations in crystalline and amorphous regions. For Pebax 1074 /PEG 1500 <b>blend</b> <b>membranes</b> in crystalline region, the gas permeability is lower than that for Pebax 1074 membrane, which decreases with the increasing PEG 1500 content. But in amorphous region, the gas permeability is higher than that for Pebax 1074 membrane, which also increases with the increasing PEG 1500 content. For N- 2, H- 2 and CH 4, the gas permeation behavior is mainly influenced by the hydrostatic pressure at high temperature, but for the polar gas CO 2, it is dominated by CO 2 -induced plasticization effect and the hydrostatic pressure simultaneously.

40|$|A physico-chemical {{characterization}} of <b>blended</b> <b>membranes</b> composed by chitosan and soy protein {{has been carried}} out in order to probe the interactions that allow membranes to be formed from these biopolymer mixtures. These membranes are developed aiming at applications in wound healing and skin tissue engineering scaffolding. The structural features of chitosan/soy <b>blended</b> <b>membranes</b> were investigated by means of solid state carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), contact angle, and atomic force microscopy. FTIR investigations suggested that chitosan and soy may have participated in a specific intermolecular interaction. The proton spin–lattice relaxation experiments in the rotating frame on <b>blended</b> <b>membranes</b> indicated that independently of the preparation conditions, the blend components are not completely miscible possibly due to a weak polymer–protein interaction. It was also shown that the blended systems showed a rougher surface morphology which was dependent of soy content in the blend system...|$|R
