25|$|Bloch {{waves are}} {{important}} because of Bloch's theorem, which states that the energy eigenstates for an electron in a crystal can be written as Bloch waves. (More precisely, it states that the electron wave functions in a crystal have a basis consisting entirely of <b>Bloch</b> <b>wave</b> energy eigenstates.) This fact underlies the concept of electronic band structures.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Using <b>Bloch</b> <b>waves</b> to {{represent}} the full solution of Maxwell’s equations in periodic media, we study the limit where the material’s period becomes {{much smaller than the}} wavelength. It is seen that for steady state fields, {{only a few of the}} <b>Bloch</b> <b>waves</b> contribute to the full solution. Effec-tive material parameters can be explicitly represented in terms of dyadic products of the mean values of the nonvanishing <b>Bloch</b> <b>waves,</b> providing a new means of homogenization.

40|$|International audienceThe complex band {{structure}} of a phononic crystal is composed of both propagating and evanescent <b>Bloch</b> <b>waves.</b> Evanescent <b>Bloch</b> <b>waves</b> {{are involved in the}} diffraction of acoustic phonons at the interfaces of finite phononic crystal structures. They are shown to arise both because of band gaps, where they directly measure the exponential decrease upon transmission, and because of the frustrated nature of higher-order diffracted waves at low frequencies. These diffracted evanescent <b>Bloch</b> <b>waves</b> become propagative as the frequency increases thus populating higher frequency bands. These results should apply as well to any periodic medium supporting the propagation of waves...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} modal conversion at {{the boundary}} between a homogeneous incident medium and a phononic crystal, with consideration {{of the impact of}} symmetry on the excitation of <b>Bloch</b> <b>waves.</b> We give a quantitative criterion for the appearance of deaf <b>Bloch</b> <b>waves,</b> which are antisymmetric with respect to a symmetry axis of the phononic crystal, in the frame of generalized Fresnel formulas for reflection and transmission at the phononic crystal boundary. This criterion is used to index <b>Bloch</b> <b>waves</b> in the complex band structure of the phononic crystal, for directions of incidence along a symmetry axis. We argue that within deaf frequency ranges transmission is multi-exponential, as it is within frequency band gaps...|$|R
25|$|These <b>Bloch</b> <b>wave</b> energy eigenstates {{are written}} with {{subscripts}} as ψn k, where n is a discrete index, called the band index, which is present {{because there are}} many different Bloch waves with the same k (each has a different periodic component u). Within a band (i.e., for fixed n), ψn k varies continuously with k, as does its energy. Also, for any reciprocal lattice vector K, ψn k = ψn,(k+K). Therefore, all distinct Bloch waves occur for k-values within the first Brillouin zone of the reciprocal lattice.|$|E
500|$|The {{metallic}} {{state has}} historically been an important building block for studying properties of solids. The first theoretical description of metals was given by Paul Drude in 1900 with the Drude model, which explained electrical and thermal properties by describing a metal as an ideal gas of then-newly discovered electrons. [...] He was able to derive the empirical Wiedemann-Franz law and get results {{in close agreement with}} the experiments. [...] This classical model was then improved by Arnold Sommerfeld who incorporated the Fermi–Dirac statistics of electrons and was able to explain the anomalous behavior of the specific heat of metals in the Wiedemann–Franz law. [...] In 1912, The structure of crystalline solids was studied by Max von Laue and Paul Knipping, when they observed the X-ray diffraction pattern of crystals, and concluded that crystals get their structure from periodic lattices of atoms. [...] In 1928, Swiss physicist Felix Bloch provided a wave function solution to the Schrödinger equation with a periodic potential, called the <b>Bloch</b> <b>wave.</b>|$|E

This is demonstrated by a simple, yet rich two-dimensional example: a perforated sheet with square symmetry (Figure 1).

40|$|The {{influence}} {{of the number of}} diffracted beams on weak-beam contrast simulations of thickness contour lines and dislocation images is investigated. For large deviation parameters sg→ thickness contour lines from two-beam simulations are similar to those from many-beam simulations. In many-beam simulations of wedge-shaped bent samples extra thickness contour lines appear at locations with (g→, 3 g→). These extra lines occur between the imaging condition (g→,-g→) and (g→, 3 g→). Therefore, {{in the case of a}} more symmetrical imaging condition many-beam simulations are mandatory. In bent samples the contributions of different <b>Bloch</b> <b>waves</b> to weak-beam images change as a function of the imaging conditions (g→, xg→). Near (g→, 3. 5 g→) two <b>Bloch</b> <b>waves</b> dominate. In the case of x < 3 two other <b>Bloch</b> <b>waves</b> with different wavelengths are most important for the image contrast.

40|$|We {{comprehensively}} investigate gap solitons and <b>Bloch</b> <b>waves</b> in one-dimensional nonlinear periodic systems. Our {{results show}} that there exists a composition relation between them: <b>Bloch</b> <b>waves</b> at either the center or edge of the Brillouin zone are infinite chains composed of fundamental gap solitons(FGSs). We argue that such a relation {{is related to the}} exact relation between nonlinear <b>Bloch</b> <b>waves</b> and nonlinear Wannier functions. With this composition relation, many conclusions can be drawn for gap solitons without any computation. For example, for the defocusing nonlinearity, there are $n$ families of FGS in the $n$th linear Bloch band gap; for the focusing case, there are infinite number of families of FGSs in the semi-infinite gap and other gaps. In addition, the stability of gap solitons is analyzed. In literature there are numerical results showing that some FGSs have cutoffs on propagation constant (or chemical potential), i. e. these FGSs do not exist for all values of propagation constant (or chemical potential) in the linear band gap. We offer an explanation for this cutoff. Comment: A longer version of our recent paper, PRL 102, 093905 (2009...|$|R
