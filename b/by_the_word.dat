Later authors changed the interpretation, commonly reading it as exclusive or, or in set theory terms symmetric difference; this step means that addition is always defined.|$|E

25|$|Euric's code {{remained}} in force among the Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula) until {{the reign of}} Liuvigild (568-586), who made a new one, the Codex Revisus, improving upon that of his predecessor.

In the 3rd codification, however, many provisions have been taken from the 2nd, and these are designated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> antiqua; by means of these antiqua we are enabled in a certain measure to reconstruct the work of Leovigild.|$|E
25|$|The costume {{collection}} {{is the most}} comprehensive in Britain, containing over 14,000 outfits plus accessories, mainly dating from 1600 to the present.

Because everyday clothing from previous eras has not generally survived, the {{collection is}} dominated by fashionable clothes made for special occasions. One of the first significant gifts of costume came in 1913 when the V received the Talbot Hughes collection containing 1,442 costumes and items as a gift from Harrods following its display at the nearby department store.|$|E
25|$|In early Christian times, 'Nazranis' {{were not}} a {{separate}} religion, but a sect in the Jewish community. The term was used to denote followers of Jesus of Nazareth. (Acts. 24:5; 28:22). 'Khristianos' (or Christians) was initially used largely to refer non-Jewish people who followed Christ (Acts 11:26). In Kerala, the sect was known as 'Nazraani Margam'. Margam in Malayalam means, 'The Way'. (Acts 9:2; 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:22). Thus, the word Nazraani clearly shows that many who joined them were Jews. But in Kerala this name was replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'Christians' in the 20th century.|$|E
