5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon mounting <b>bracket</b> that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the mounting <b>bracket</b> at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's mounting <b>bracket</b> in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|E

40|$|Available {{commercial}} ceramic <b>brackets</b> {{are made}} of alumina either monocrystalline or polycrystalline. One major drawback of these <b>brackets</b> is fracture during archwire torsion or tipping. Another drawback is that each type comes in one shade only: transparent or translucent. Objectives: To fabricate orthodontic <b>brackets</b> from different esthetic materials and evaluate their mechanical properties; to introduce extremely low profile miniature zirconia <b>brackets</b> and evaluate their torsional fracture strength; also, to fabricate <b>brackets</b> in shades comparable to natural tooth shades, and compare them to commercial ceramic <b>brackets</b> under different lights. Materials and Methods: CAD/CAM technology was used to mill <b>brackets</b> from: ParadigmTM MZ 100 and LavaTM Ultimate resin composite; Mark II feldspathic porcelain; and In-Ceram® YZ zirconia. The <b>brackets</b> were subjected to two separate tests (torque and tipping). The average moments necessary to fracture the <b>brackets</b> were determined and compared to those of commercial alumina <b>brackets,</b> Mystique® MB and Resolve®. Also, miniature zirconia <b>brackets</b> were fabricated and subjected to torsion till failure. Static fatigue test was performed on standard YZ, MZ 100, and Mystique <b>brackets.</b> <b>Brackets</b> were fabricated using CAD/CAM in shade A 3 materials: MZ 100; Lava Ultimate; and Mark II. Zirconia and alumina <b>brackets</b> were also fabricated and colored. Adobe Photoshop software {{was used to determine}} ΔE values between the <b>brackets</b> and A 3 acrylic teeth from digital images taken under three different lights (daylight, fluorescent, and incandescent). The shaded <b>brackets</b> were compared to commercial alumina brackets: Inspire ICETM; Radiance PlusTM; Avex® CX; and Mystique® MB. Results: Standard zirconia <b>brackets</b> had the highest torsional and tipping strength among the tested esthetic <b>brackets.</b> Miniature zirconia <b>brackets</b> showed comparable or even statistically significantly higher resistance to archwire torsion than commercial alumina <b>brackets.</b> Standard zirconia <b>brackets</b> showed the highest survival rate of 83 %. Under daylight, Radiance Plus and Lava Ultimate <b>brackets</b> had the smallest mean ΔE values. Lava Ultimate <b>brackets</b> had the smallest mean ΔE under fluorescent and incandescent light. Conclusions: Esthetic <b>brackets</b> can be fabricated in extremely low profile and smaller dimensions from zirconia with fracture strength comparable to the bulkier commercial alumina <b>brackets.</b> Also, <b>brackets</b> can be produced in natural tooth shades enhancing their esthetic appearance. 2018 - 09 - 28 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Enamel {{demineralization}} after fixed {{orthodontic treatment}} {{can occur in}} 50 % of patients. <b>Brackets</b> {{play a significant role}} in enamel demineralization. Silver has already been prooved to have antibacterial properties. Hence the present study is conducted to assess the antiadherent and antibacterial properties of photocatalytic silver dioxide (AgO 2) surface modified stainless steel orthodontic <b>brackets</b> against S. mutans. Materials and Methods: 80 stainless steel <b>brackets</b> of maxillary right central incisor <b>brackets</b> were divided into four groups. Each group consisted of 20 <b>brackets.</b> Groups containing uncoated <b>brackets</b> acted as a control group for their respective experimental group containing silver dioxide coated <b>brackets.</b> <b>Brackets</b> then were subjected to microbiological tests for assessment of their antiadherent and antibacterial properties against S. mutans. Results: Coated <b>Brackets</b> showed antiadherent effect against S. mutans compared with uncoated <b>brackets.</b> The bacterial mass that was bound to the AgO 2 coated <b>brackets</b> was less when compared with the uncoated <b>brackets.</b> Furthermore, AgO 2 coated <b>brackets</b> had a bactericidal effect on S. mutans. Conclusion: Coating <b>brackets</b> with photocatalytic silver di-oxide would be an innovative and logical step in preventing development of periodontal disease and white spot lesion in patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment...|$|R

The hall {{is located on the}} far east side of the temple, atop a large stone platform. It is a single storey structure measuring seven bays by four or 34 by 17.7 metres (110 by 58ft), and is supported by inner and outer sets of columns. On top of each column is a complicated set of brackets containing seven different <b>bracket</b> types that are one-third as high as the column itself. Supporting the roof of the hall, each of the <b>bracket</b> sets are connected by crescent shaped crossbeams, which create an inner ring above the inner set of columns and an outer ring above the outer columns.

The hipped-roof and the extremely complex <b>bracket</b> sets are testament to the Great East Hall's importance as a structure during the Tang Dynasty. According to the 11th-century architectural treatise, Yingzao Fashi, the Great East Hall closely corresponds to a seventh rank building in a system of eight ranks.

Because of their distinct differences during fabrication, two types of ceramic <b>brackets</b> are available, namely the polycrystalline alumina and the single crystal alumina or monocrystalline alumina [5]. The most apparent difference between polycrystalline and single crystal <b>brackets</b> is in their optical clarity. Single crystal <b>brackets</b> are noticeably clearer than polycrystalline <b>brackets,</b> {{which tend to be}} translucent and more esthetic [6]. It has been reported that under all conditions tested, ceramic <b>brackets</b> generate higher frictional forces than stainless steel <b>brackets.</b> Despite their superior esthetics, monocrystalline ceramic <b>brackets</b> produce higher frictional forces than polycrystalline ceramic <b>brackets</b> [7, 8].
