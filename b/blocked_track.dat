The workmen quickly fix the runway, but they need George to finish the job and with Harvey {{on the other side of}} Sodor, and is too far away to clear the <b>blocked</b> <b>track</b> in time, so they can bring George, who is too slow to come here by himself. There is no chance of the aeroplane landing. Thomas quickly has an idea and rushes off to find Diesel 10. Thomas gathers his courage and asks Diesel 10 to help them and tells him that he will be the most useful engine of the day. Diesel 10 is hesitant at first, but eventually agrees and follows Thomas to the airport. The steamies are shocked to see Thomas and Diesel 10 working together. Seeing Diesel 10 working alongside a steam engine convinces Diesel, 'Arry and Bert to finally respect the steam engines themselves. With the aid of the other engines, they clear up the mess and Thomas collects George to fix the runway.|$|E
50|$|Seok-woo {{receives}} {{a call from}} his coworker, who informs him that Busan has fought off the zombies. However, Seok-woo also learns {{that it was his}} company that helped fund a project that caused the outbreak. After the phone call, the train suddenly slows to a stop. A <b>blocked</b> <b>track</b> at the East Daegu train station forces the survivors to stop and search for another train. A runaway train crashes into the infected train, trapping the four remaining survivors. In the process, Seok-woo, Seong-kyeong, Soo-an, and the homeless man are separated from Yong-guk and Jin-hee. Yon-suk, who survived with a train attendant by hiding in a bathroom, manages to escape by pushing the attendant into the zombies. Entering the train where Yong-guk and Jin-hee are hiding, Yon-suk throws Jin-hee into the path of a zombie, and she is bitten by a zombie. Heartbroken, Yong-guk stays with Jin-hee and is bitten when she turns. The locomotive engineer starts a locomotive moving on another track but is killed by zombies while trying to aid Yon-suk, who boards the locomotive. The homeless man sacrifices himself so that Soo-an and Seong-kyeong can escape with Seok-woo and reach the locomotive. Entering its cab, they encounter an infected Yon-suk, who attacks Seok-Woo, biting his hand before Seok-woo throws him from the vehicle. He puts Soo-an and Seong-kyeong inside the engine room, shows Seong-kyeong how to brake the engine, says goodbye to his daughter, and goes outside. As he zombifies, he remembers the first time he held his daughter, then falls {{from the rear of the}} locomotive.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Observations of the MAP special observing period reveal two {{different}} track patterns for Genoa cyclones as they impinge on the Apennines. In some cases, the cyclones {{appear to be}} completely blocked by the orography and are deflected southward (e. g. IOP- 1). In other cases, the cyclones do cross over the Apennines, but. experience a period wherein two surface cyclones exist, one on the upstream side and a new, secondary cyclone on the downstream side of the mountains. Aloft, the system propagates without stalling. With time, the upper level trough phases with the secondary cyclone and the secondary cyclone becomes the dominant feature. Such a track {{is referred to as}} a discontinuous, but not <b>blocked</b> <b>track</b> {{for the purposes of this}} research. One such case during MAP belonging to this category is IOP- 8. The aim of this study is to understand the control parameters that dictate whether a cyclone is blocked and deflected or if it is discontinuous, but not blocked. Examination of observations as well as ECMWF reanalysis data shows there is a dependency on the vortex Froude number {Fvortex) with smaller values of Fvortex indicating a greater likelihood for cyclone blocking and deflection. However, numerical sensitivity experiments indicate there are other, more important control parameters that dictate the degree of track deflection...|$|E

40|$|Interactions between DNA {{molecules}} {{can be used}} {{to perform}} computation. These DNA computing systems often use DNA molecules as freely diusing reactants in a well-mixed solution. We demonstrate how DNA walkers tethered to an origami-templated track can perform computation. A DNA walker can block a track that intersects with its own, preventing another walker from stepping down this <b>blocked</b> <b>track.</b> These blockages are primitive operations that {{can be used to}} perform computation. This thesis demonstrates how blocking interactions between DNA walkers can evaluate formulae posed in propositional logic. When anchorages in the track are viewed as networked machines and the DNA walker is viewed as a coordinated message passed between them, DNA walker circuits can be modelled as a distributed system. Techniques from formal veri- cation can be used to check this system for errors, determining the probability with which the system will end up in a certain state. This forms the basis of a compiler that can automatically design a DNA walker circuit that evaluates a given propositional formula within a specied error tolerance. To show how DNA walker circuits can be simplied, we create a propositional logic system called blocking logic that is proven to be both sound and complete. DNA walker circuits can be implemented and measured experimentally by using fluorescence spectrophotometry to track the position of a walker on the track. To demonstrate proof of principle, circuits were built that implement NOT and NOR operators. To make these circuits operate with minimal error, dierent sources of possible error were investigated and quantied. Cumulatively, the novel contributions that this thesis makes to the eld are: â¢ the experimental design and implementation of a DNA computing system that uses DNA walkers, â¢ probabilistic model checking software that automatically designs these DNA walker circuits, â¢ a propositional logic system that can simplify a DNA walker circuit to an equivalent circuit that uses fewer tracks. </p...|$|E

40|$|One {{of the new}} {{features}} in Oracle 10 g is Fast Incremental Backups, which require that databases be run with <b>Block</b> Change <b>Tracking</b> enabled. While the usage of Fast Incremental Backups has been discussed quite thoroughly in recent years, the internals of the change-tracking feature implementation in Oracle 10 g are still obscure. This presentation will show how change-tracking works inside an Oracle instance, and what CTWR process does. It will illustrate how other processes are involved and discuss the overhead caused by <b>Block</b> Change <b>Tracking.</b> This information is obtained by the means of experiments and advanced research techniques. WHY THIS PAPER? Oracle RMAN {{was able to take}} incremental backups already in 9 i. However, prior to introduction of Oracle 10 g <b>block</b> change <b>tracking</b> (BCT), RMAN had to scan the whole datafile to and filter out the blocks that were not changed since base incremental backup and overhead or incremental backup was as high as full backup. Oracle 10 g new feature, <b>block</b> change <b>tracking,</b> minimizes number of blocks RMAN needs to read to a strict minimum. With <b>block</b> change <b>tracking</b> enabled RMAN accesses on disk only blocks that were changed since the latest base incremental backup. This feature is widely known in the world of Oracle database administrators. However, hardly anything is available on internal implementation of <b>block</b> change <b>tracking.</b> This makes it difficult to evaluate the impact of enabling BCT in Oracle databases and quantify performance overhead. This paper and presentation try to uncover internals of <b>block</b> change <b>tracking</b> and show which areas of Oracle database are involved, how processes work together, what are hidden limitations and impact of enabling <b>block</b> change <b>tracking.</b> DISCLAIMER I cannot provide any guarantee that presented material is absolutely correct. There is no publicly available documentation on change tracking internals (at least, I’m not aware of any) so this paper is based purely on experiments and research plus few hints from more knowledgeable peers that I’m very grateful for. Please take this material carefully and make sure you validate my assumptions before making critical decisions – either with your own tests or request Oracle support to provide more information if your business requires it...|$|R
