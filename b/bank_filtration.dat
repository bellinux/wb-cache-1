The water quality of pumped raw water from <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> sites depends to a high degree on the water quality of the infiltrating surface water and the landside groundwater, the mixed portion of both, {{as well as the}} flow and transport conditions in the aquifer. Following the improvement of river water quality and a drastic decrease in water demand during the last 20 years in Germany, the influence of landside groundwater quality has become more important for the raw water quality of waterworks relying on <b>bank</b> <b>filtration.</b> The hydrogeologic analysis of three <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> sites in Saxony and the management of abstraction rates and well operation in response to fluctuating water demand are discussed. 1 <b>Bank</b> <b>filtration</b> in Germany In Germany, only 3 % of the annually available water re-sources are needed for the public water supply.

40|$|Background: Continuous {{expansion}} of potable water pollution sources {{is one of}} the main concerns of water suppliers, therefore measures such as water safety plan (WSP), have been taken into account to control these sources of pollution. The aim of this study was to identify probable risks and threatening hazards to drinking water quality in Lighvan village along with assessment of <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> of the village. Methods: In the present study all risks and probable hazards were identified and ranked. For each of these cases, practical suggestions for removing or controlling them were given. To assess potable water quality in Lighvan village, sampling was done from different parts of the village and physicochemical parameters were measured. To assess the efficiency of <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> system of the village, independent t test was used to compare average values of parameters in river and treated water. Results: One of the probable sources of pollution in this study was domestic wastewater which threatens water quality. The results of this study show that <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> efficiency in water supply of the village is acceptable. Conclusion: Although <b>Bank</b> <b>filtration</b> imposes fewer expenses on governments, it provides suitable water for drinking and other uses. However, it should be noted that application of these systems should be done after a thorough study of water pollution level, types of water pollutants, soil properties of the area, soil percolation and system distance from pollutant sources. ...|$|E

40|$|Peatlands {{are serving}} {{as one of}} the most {{important}} terrestrial carbon stores in the United Kingdom and globally. In the UK, the current trend of peatlands turning from carbon sinks to carbon sources is widely observed and reported. As numerous factors may affect the carbon cycle of peatlands, including climate, land management, hydrology and vegetation, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was commonly used as an indicator of peatland carbon changes. Besides the function as an indicator of carbon turnover in peatland, increasing DOC in the stream water also raises concern in water companies as the removal of DOC from water represents a major cost of water treatment. This thesis investigates the impacts of land management such as drain blocking and revegetation on stream DOC changes. By building a pilot column study, this thesis also assessed the potential of <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> serving as DOC treatment in UK. Results of drain blocking shows the management was a significant impact on the DOC changes. However, later investigation of peak flow events indicates such positive impacts from drain blocking were minor in terms of high peak flow events. Since the majority of DOC export occurred during such peak flow events, drain blocking were found not as an efficient management of DOC changes. The field study of revegetation observed minor effects of revegetation on stream DOC. The results of column <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> indicate low DOC removal rate under the current stream DOC level in UK. The <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> may efficient remove DOC when higher DOC input applied. However, it is not suitable for UK peatland under current DOC export. ...|$|E

Currently, water {{treatment}} plants, which utilize downflow direct filtration technology, have been facing {{problems such as}} cyanobacteria growth within water sources. Depending on the species involved, the resulting water quality may be jeopardized due to the cyanobacterial ability to produce saxitoxins. They also obstruct the filter systems that may be damaged. Downflow direct filtering technologies may not be recommended for {{water treatment}} of sources with high cyanobacterial density. Its application could only be considered after a pre-treatment stage. Some removal technologies {{are available in the}} market; though efficient, they are not under economic and practical possibilities. This paper intends to utilize <b>Bank</b> <b>filtration</b> as a pre-treatment for downflow direct filtration in order to present a low-cost treatment option for proper water quality, and the removal of both cyanobacteria and saxitoxins. Experimental investigations were conducted on the Laboratório de Águas da Lagoa do Peri - LALP and at the water potabilization laboratory (Laboratório de Potabilização de Água - LAPOA/UFSC) under the following stages: 1) Characterization of Peri Lake water (Water I), of <b>Bank</b> <b>filtration</b> water (Water II), and of study water (Water III = 85 % FM + 15 % Lake); 2) Continuous and non-continuous bench tests in order to determine saxitoxin adsorption and removal by sedimentation of the Peri Lake water source; 3) Bench tests on coagulant and coagulant aid dosage optimization; 4) Continuous testing using the optimal doses previously determined in order to follow cyanobacteria and saxitoxin identification and quantification. Saxitoxin analysis was performed using HPLC with post-column derivation and fluorescence detection. Results demonstrated that saxitoxins (STX) have more affinity with sediments when compared with neosaxitoxins (NEO). A complete removal of STX occurred in less than 5 days; in turn, NEO required more time # approximately 15 days. <b>Bank</b> <b>filtration</b> {{has proved to be a}} promising technology for cyanobacterial cells and saxitoxin removal. <b>Bank</b> <b>filtration</b> used as a pre-treatment caused the filtration system to last 3 - 4 times longer, reducing up to 50 % of aluminum sulfate dosages.

Results have shown the importance of conditioning water with high density of potentially toxic cyanobacteria before downflow direct filtration. Regarding saxitoxin removal, no saxitoxins were detected on the Water II samples. After complete treatment, 0, 05 mg/L intracellular EqSTX was detected. Although under the limiting values, equivalent concentrations in the treated water must be considered, especially considering that the frequent consumption effects of low saxitoxin dosages on human health are unknown...|$|E

As most restored rivers are not monitored at all, it is difficult to predict consequences of restoration projects or analyze why restorations fail or are successful.

40|$|The {{groundwater}} in {{the area}} of Dravsko polje is over polluted with pesticides (atrazine and its metabolites) and nitrate. At Skorba waterworks this problem is being temporarily solved by blending alluvial with deep groundwater. Because this is only a temporary solution there is a great tendency to introduce eventual technological procedures for drinking water treatment since the chemical improvement of quality would take many decades. When it comes to the groundwater the consequences are even longer due to its slow flow. On the basis of chemical analysis of the groundwater and of the drinking water at Skorba waterworks a comparison was made on possible procedures which could assure the required quality of drinking water. Extensive consideration was given to processes of denitration and denitrification as well as adsorption of atrazine. Because of great organoleptic properties of the groundwater there was a tendency to take the advantage of it, although the river Drava is very close and offers enough water to fulfill the needs of drinking water. The thesis also describes the possibility of using raw river water or <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> which has more quality. Where the hydrogeological properties are suitable, quality drinking water from rivers can be gained from <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> by using the natural self-cleaning ability in river bed sediments.

40|$|The {{infiltration}} of river water into aquifers is of high relevance to drinking-water production {{and is a}} key driver of biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic and riparian zone, but the distribution and quantification of the infiltrating water are difficult to determine using conventional hydrological methods (e. g., borehole logging and tracer tests). By time-lapse inverting crosshole ERT (electrical resistivity tomography) monitoring data, we imaged groundwater flow patterns driven by river water infiltrating a perialpine gravel aquifer in northeastern Switzerland. This was possible because the electrical resistivity of the infiltrating water changed during rainfall-runoff events. Our time-lapse resistivity models indicated rather complex flow patterns {{as a result of}} spatially heterogeneous <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> and aquifer heterogeneity. The upper part of the aquifer was most affected by the river infiltrate, and the highest groundwater velocities and possible preferential flow occurred at shallow to intermediate depths.

The biotransformation of trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) strongly {{depends on the}} redox conditions {{as well as on}} the dissolved organic carbon availability.

In this study, four parallel laboratory-scale soil column experiments using different intermittent aeration techniques were selected to further optimize TOrCs transformation during MAR: no aeration, aeration with air, pure oxygen and ozone. Rapid oxygen consumption, nitrate reduction and dissolution of manganese confirmed anoxic conditions within the first filtration step, mimicking traditional <b>bank</b> <b>filtration.</b> Aeration with air led to suboxic conditions, whereas oxidation by pure oxygen and ozone led to fully oxic conditions throughout the second system. The sequential system resulted in an equal or better transformation of most TOrCs compared to the single step <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> system. Despite the fast oxygen consumption, acesulfame, iopromide, iomeprol and valsartan were degraded within the first infiltration step.

Further improvement of benzotriazole and gabapentin removal by using pure oxygen confirmed potential oxygen limitation in the second column after aeration with air.

40|$|Ca. 75 % des Berliner Trinkwassers besteht aus lokal gefördertem Uferfiltrat bzw. künstlich angerei-chertem Grundwasser (Schulze 1997). Gleichzeitig leiten Berlins teilweise stromaufwärts von Uferfiltratstrecken eingeleitet. Szenarien prognostizieren zudem einen lokalen Anstieg der Abwasseranteile (Schumacher & Skripalle 1999, Heinzmann 1997). Da Kläranlageneinleitungen zu Stoffeinträgen führen, die trotz Bodenpassage und Wasseraufbereitung bis ins Trinkwasser gelangen können, wurden sowohl die Reinigungsleistung der Berliner Uferfiltration für organische Stoffe (DOC) sowie der Einfluss erhöhter Abwasseranteile untersucht. Das Hauptaugenmerk der Untersu-chungen lag auf der Selbstreinigungskraft sowie dem Regenerationsvermögen der Ressource Wasser, deren Erhalt im Sinne einer Nachhaltigen Wasserwirtschaft gefordert wird (Lehn et al. 1999). Über zwei Jahre wurden die gelösten organischen Stoffe an Uferfiltrationsstrecken an Tegeler See und Müggelsee in Berlin untersucht. Im Mittel werden ca. 20 - 45 % des DOC bei der Bodenpassage entfernt. Mit Bodensäulen gelingt eine Elimination von 30 % des DOC nach drei Metern. Vor allem höhermolekulare Anteile des DOC werden bei der Uferfiltration eliminiert, insbesondere eine den Polysacchariden zugeordnete Fraktion (®LC-OCD). Das Adsorptionsverhalten der gelösten organi-schen Stoffe (®Adsorptionsanalyse) ist sowohl vor als auch nach der Bodenpassage als schlecht ein-zuordnen. Die Reinigungsleistung der Uferfiltration für den DOC ist in Berlin-Tegel seit Jahrzehnten stabil und hängt vor allem von der Oberflächenwasserqualität ab. Kläranlageneinleitungen erhöhen den refraktären Teil organischer Verbindungen (RDOC) in den Berliner Gewässern. Sie tragen aber nicht zu einer wesentlichen Veränderung des Charakters des DOC bei in Bezug auf Molekulargewichtsverteilung, Adsorptionsverhalten oder Verteilung der funk-tionellen Gruppen (® 13 C-NMR). In Tegel trägt eine Phosphateliminierungsanlage (Fe-Flockung) zur Reduktion von ca. 25 - 30 % der zum Teil kläranlagenbürtigen organischen Stoffe bei. Entfernt wird vor allem der hochmolekulare huminstoffähnliche Anteil. Am Beispiel Berlin Tegels, wo für Berlin die höchsten Abwasseranteile im Trinkwasser von ca. 14 - 28 % vorliegen, wurden die Grenzen der indirekten Abwasserwiederverwendung untersucht. Zunächst wurden für RDOC, Chlorid und Sulfat die irreversiblen Stoffeinträge durch Wasserverbraucher sowie Kläranlagen bilanziert, indem die Stofffrachten des Berliner Trinkwassers denen der Kläranlagen-abläufe gegenübergestellt wurden. Die resultierenden Stoffeinträge (75 - 90 mg/l Chlorid, 35 - 45 mg/l Sulfat, 4 - 5 mg/l RDOC) werden in einem Modell (TegelSIM) zur Prognose der Trinkwasserkonzentra-tionen bei erhöhten Abwasseranteilen verwendet. TegelSIM zeigt, dass bei Rückführung von 60 % Trinkwasser zu der Kläranlage, deren Abwässer wieder zur Trinkwassergewinnung beitragen, bis zu Abwasseranteilen von 90 % im Trinkwasser keine problematischen Sulfat-, Chlorid- oder RDOC-Konzentrationen erreicht werden (Worst-Case: 248 mg/l SO 4, 207 mg/l Cl, 7, 7 mg/l RDOC). Für persistente Stoffe läßt sich die {{relative}} Trinkwasserkonzentration bezogen auf den Stoffeintrag je nach Abwasseranteil im Trinkwasser berechnen. Derzeit betrügen die Konzentrationen im Tegeler Trinkwasser infolge Verdünnung ca. 1 / 3 des Stoffeintrags eines persistenten bzw. refraktären Stoffes. Die Uferfiltration und künstliche Grundwasseranreicherung in Berlin tragen aufgrund ihrer langfristig fortbestehenden Reinigungsleistung und ihres geringen Energie- und Wartungsbedarfs zu einer nachhaltigen Wasserwirtschaft bei. Das Berliner System, in dem es teilweise zur indirekten Abwasser-wiederverwendung kommt, stößt allerdings mit Bezug auf die Selbstreinigungskraft insbesondere bei persistenten organischen Einzelstoffen an seine Grenzen. About 75 % of Berlin´s {{drinking water}} is bank filtrate or artificially recharged groundwater. At the same time, Berlin´s treated wastewater is being discharged partially upstream of <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> sites. The surface water flow into Berlin is with about 53 m³/s relatively low. Due to lower groundwater abstraction for lignite coal mining upstream of Berlin, {{the first two}} decades of the 21 st century will see a further reduction of this surface water flow to about 30 m³/s (Finke 2000). As a consequence, the portions of treated wastewater might increase in Berlin´s surface waters used for <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> and groundwater recharge. To ensure a high quality of the city´s drinking water, {{more information on the}} purification potential of Berlin´s <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> systems is required as well as increased knowledge about the consequences of increased wastewater portions in drinking water sources. This thesis investigates the purification capacity of <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> and groundwater recharge for dissolved organic substances. The focus lies on two aspects of a sustainable water management: the aspect of a long-term (self-) purification capacity of water, and the potential of water to be regenerated or recycled (adapted from Lehn et al. 1999). To investigate the aspect of (self-) purification of water via <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> in Berlin, DOC and UV analysis was carried out for monthly sampled groundwater monitoring wells over a period of two years. The monitoring wells are located at the banks of the lakes Tegeler See and Müggelsee in Berlin. In addition, soil passage was simulated using soil columns. Molecular weight distribution of organic compounds in bank filtrate, surface waters, treated wastewater and drinking water {{as well as for the}} soil columns was determined using batch-ultrafiltration and size exclusion chromatography (LC-OCD). Adsorption analysis gave information about the adsorption behavior of DOC on activated carbon. DOC of effluent, lake water, and two bank filtrates was fractionated using XAD resins (8 and 4 in tandem), and functional groups of the isolated DOC were analyzed using 13 C-NMR. Lake <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> in Berlin eliminates about 20 - 45 % of DOC. Using soil columns, 30 % of DOC are eliminated after 3 meters. Larger molecular weight compounds are preferably removed during <b>bank</b> <b>filtration,</b> especially a fraction of polysaccharides (identified using LC-OCD). Dissolved organic substances of both Berlin´s surface waters and bank filtrates have been found to adsorb very poorly onto activated carbon. Wastewater discharges increase both DOC and the refractory part of dissolved organic compounds (RDOC) in surface waters. However, the character of DOC in surface waters is not changed significantly, namely molecular weight distribution, adsorption behavior and functional group distribution. In Berlin, the increase in RDOC due to wastewater discharges is not reflected in bank filtrate quality, although wastewater is partly being discharged upstream of <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> sites. DOC concentrations of lake Tegeler See and Tegel drinking water, which contains 80 % bank filtrate and artificially recharged water, show that the purification capacity of lake <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> remains constant over decades, and that drinking water DOC is mainly dependent on surface water quality. In lake Tegeler See, phosphate elimination by iron flocculation and the subsequent decrease of eutrophication both led to a reduction in DOC concentrations of about 4 - 6 mg/l. This reduction is reflected in DOC concentrations of Tegel drinking water, which decreased by about 1, 5 mg/l. In a second part of the thesis, the qualitative and quantitative limits of indirect wastewater reuse were investigated. In Berlin, lake Tegeler See is a special example of indirect waste-water reuse: About 80 % of the groundwater abstracted around this lake consists of lake water. One of the largest water treatment plants of Berlin (WTP Tegel) abstracts lake water via <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> and artificial groundwater recharge. The portions of treated wastewater in the lake were found to be about 17 - 35 % (mean values, 1993 - 1998). In Tegel drinking water, wastewater portions were calculated to be 14 - 28 %. Berlin´s other water treatment plants have much lower portions that might reach maximum values of 11 % in times of extreme water shortage. Water users and wastewater treatment plants cause irreversible inputs of certain substances, such as RDOC, chloride, and to some extent sulfate. RDOC, chloride and sulfate inputs were quantified for Berlin by comparing the mass fluxes of Berlin´s drinking water with those of Berlin´s treated wastewater. The difference is called water use input. In Berlin, a single use cycle of water increases chloride by about 75 - 90 mg/l, sulfate by about 35 - 45 mg/l, and RDOC by about 4 - 5 mg/l. The water use input can explain the total input of DOC into Berlin´s surface waters (comparison of surface water mass fluxes into and out of Berlin). However, both chloride and sulfate fluxes increase to an extent that neither the water use input nor other material fluxes, i. e. from drainage water, can explain this increase satisfyingly. To quantify the limits of indirect wastewater reuse in partly closed water cycles with regard to drinking water concentrations of salts, RDOC, and single refractory compounds, a model was created (TegelSIM). The model was used to calculate scenarios for the Tegel water cycle. It was shown that when 60 % of wastewater at WWTP Schönerlinde originate from WTP Tegel, 90 % of this drinking water would have to consist of wastewater for salt concentrations to exceed drinking water standards. For this unlikely case, sulfate concentration in drinking water would be 248 mg/l, chloride concentration 207 mg/l, and DOC 7, 7 mg/l. Using TegelSIM, the accumulation of a persistent compound added by water users in a partly closed water cycle can be simulated. It is assumed that the compound is neither eliminated in the WWTP nor during flocculation and soil passage. To reach or surpass the concentration of the water use input in drinking water, at least 62 % of drinking water would have to consist of treated wastewater (while assuming that 60 % of wastewater consists of this same drinking water). Although added constantly, the concentration in drinking water would reach a maximum under stable conditions. Lake <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> and artificial groundwater recharge in Berlin play an important role in sustainable water management in the city due to their stable purification capacity and low energy and maintenance requirements. Berlin´s water system with its cases of unplanned, indirect wastewater reuse is limited in its (self-) purification capacity, especially when looking at persistent, polar organic compounds. A planned water reuse for Berlin would require an assessment and evaluation of concentrations of those persistent compounds in drinking water...|$|E
30|$|Conclusions Following today’s {{state of}} {{knowledge}} activated carbon filtration (eventually coupled with ozonization) is {{best suited to}} remove drug residues and other xenobiotics from raw water. Water works that do not apply the activated carbon filtration technique for cleanup of <b>bank</b> <b>filtration</b> water should consider an upgrade. The ozonization is primarily required for disinfection of the water. As no acute health hazard proceeds from drinking water contamination by pharmaceuticals at the present time, the upgrade of wastewater treatment plants {{by one of the}} aforementioned innovative methods is currently not required in view of drinking water quality. This offers the opportunity to develop sustainable approaches that already aim to reduce drug contaminations of wastewater and hence of ground-, surface- and drinking water.|$|E
40|$|<b>Bank</b> <b>filtration</b> induces flow {{of surface}} water through a {{hydraulically}} connected aquifer by excess pumping from a production {{well in the}} aquifer. This review presents the four main geochemical processes relevant for inorganic geochemistry, {{with a focus on}} iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn), during bank filtration: reduction near the bank, oxidation near the production well, carbonate dissolution, and sorption to aquifer materials. Physical and transport processes affect these geochemical processes and influence the redox state of the infiltrate. The presence of Fe and Mn in bank infiltrate is directly related to its redox status and can necessitate drinking water treatment after extraction. Long-term, in situ sequestration of Fe and Mn requires precipitation of oxide or carbonate solids, since a sorption front can breakthrough at the production well...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the chemical composition of groundwater from an alluvial granular aquifer {{in a valley}} fill flood plain (River Thur Valley). The river flows along this valley and is mostly downwelling on its way, indirectly through an unsaturated zone in the upstream part, and directly through the water-saturated bed in the downstream part. River Thur has been channelized with barriers {{for more than a}} century. In 1992, the authorities started to restore a section of River Thur with riverbed enlargements. The land use in the flood plain and the seasonal and climatic conditions (e. g., hot dry summer 2003) result in alterations of the natural geochemical composition of the river water. This groundwater is partly to mainly recharged by <b>bank</b> <b>filtration.</b> Several wells exist near the river that draw groundwater for drinking. In some of these wells, the groundwater has a very short residence time in the subsurface of days to weeks. Bed enlargements and other operations for an enhancement of the exchange of water between the river and groundwater increase the contamination risk of the nearby wells. During <b>bank</b> <b>filtration,</b> the groundwater changes gradually its composition, with increasing distance from the river and with depth in the aquifer. From today's changes of the water quality during riverbank filtration, we tried to extrapolate to the groundwater quality that may arise from future river restorations. Today the groundwater body consists of a mixture of groundwater from the seepage of precipitation and from riverbank filtration. The main difference between river water and groundwater results from the microbial activity in riverbed and bank materials. This activity leads to a consumption of O 2 and to a higher partial pressure of CO 2 in the groundwater. Criteria for the distinction of different groundwater compositions are the distance of a well from the river and the subsurface residence time of the groundwater to reach this well...|$|E
