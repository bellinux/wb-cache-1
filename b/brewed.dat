5|$|Beer is {{the oldest}} and most widely {{consumed}} alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea. Beer is <b>brewed</b> from cereal grains — most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is <b>brewed</b> with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, Guinness West India Porter, {{the direct}} {{predecessor}} of Foreign Extra Stout, was first exported from the St. James's Gate brewery in Dublin. The product was formulated for Irish immigrant {{workers in the}} Caribbean. The beer was only <b>brewed</b> between October and April, which reduced acidification, and was matured in large wooden vats {{for up to two}} years, which gave the finished product greater stability. To survive the long journey overseas, which was then taken by ship, it was <b>brewed</b> with extra hops and a higher alcohol content, which acted as natural preservatives for the beer. Exported in barrels, the product was then bottled locally, which helped to reduce costs.|$|E
