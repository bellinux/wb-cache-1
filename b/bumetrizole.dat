40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} potential toxic or environmentally relevant organic compounds in the aquifers of the Amynteo hydrogeological basin and to investigate a possible link of the identified organic contaminants with the Pliocene Amynteo lignites. For these purposes, 10 groundwater samples were collected from this area. A sequential liquid–liquid extraction procedure was applied and all extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) by means of a non-target screening approach. The results of the GC–MS analyses of the extracts are presented and discussed in this work. The identified organic compounds with a potential environmental relevance are: 2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 3 -pentanediol diisobutyrate, triacetine, isopropyl palminate, isopropyl myristate, tributyl-, triethyl- and trioctylphosphates, N,N-dibutyl formamide, methyl dihydrojasmonate, nonylphenols and <b>bumetrizole.</b> However, all these organic micropollutants can derive either by anthropogenic emissions (plasticizers, industrial pollutants, pesticides, etc.) or by contaminations from the pump and the borehole structure itself. Noteworthy, coal-derived organic molecules (such as anthracene, fluorene, pyrene, phenanthrene, etc.) have not been detected. Hence, an influence of coal deposits to the groundwater quality is considered negligible. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin A palmitate {{has been}} used in cosmetics; however, studies report that this {{substance}} shows photoreactivity that can lead to loss of safety and efficacy. On the other hand, photostabilizers have been used to increase sunscreen photostability and consequently their safety and effectiveness. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the influence of photostabilizers on the photoprotective effects of a cosmetic formulation containing UV-filters and vitamin A palmitate. The formulation containing UV-filters was supplemented with vitamin A palmitate and the photostabilizers diethylhexyl 2, 6 -naphthalate (DEHN), <b>bumetrizole</b> and benzotriazolyl dodecyl p-cresol (BTDC). Hairless mice were treated daily by topical applications and irradiated (UVA/B). Erythema index, transepidermal water loss, histological/histometric analysis and number of sunburn cells (SBC) were evaluated. The results showed that all formulations protected from UV-induced enhancement of erythema and SBC but there was no difference among them. The formulation with no stabilizers reduced viable epidermis thickness due to atrophy induced by UV radiation. Thus, it can be concluded that the presence of photostabilizers influenced the effects of formulations containing UV-filters and vitamin A palmitate, which could be seen by histological and histometric analysis. Furthermore, the formulations containing the stabilizers DEHN and BTDC showed better protective effects on hairless mice skin.
