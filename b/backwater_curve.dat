Under steady state conditions {{the sensitivity of the}} water depth to the Strickler coefficient is shown to obey a first-order ordinary differential equation that becomes linear under uniform conditions. This allows a "half-distance" to be defined, which indicates the size of the region over which the Strickler coefficient can be calibrated from stage measurements. This region extends downstream of the stage measurement point under subcritical conditions and upstream under supercritical conditions. The validity of the approach is checked against typical <b>backwater</b> <b>curve</b> calculations. The sensitivity obtained by the local perturbation approach is very close to the empirical sensitivity, even when the Strickler coefficient is perturbed by +/- 25 %, which validates the use of the approach in practical applications...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project is to develop new measuring techniques for providing detailed data on sediment sorting suitable for sand-gravel laboratory experiments. Such data will be of aid in obtaining new insights on sorting mechanisms and improving prediction capabilities of morphodynamic models. Two measuring techniques have been developed. The first technique is aimed at measuring the size stratification of a sand-gravel deposit through combining image analysis and a sediment removal technique. The image analysis technique is based on color segmentation of areal images of a bed surface composed of colored sediment. After taking images {{a thin layer of}} sediment is removed, and a new series of images is taken of the newly exposed part of the deposit. The resulting size stratification data is characterized by a high spatial resolution. Using the technique one can avoid time consuming sieve analysis, and the data is processed using an automatic and fast image processing algorithm. The second technique is aimed at measuring the spatial and temporal changes in the bed surface texture during flow in a sand-gravel laboratory experiment. The above image analysis technique is used to process images of the bed surface taken during flow. A floating device, which is moved over the entire observation section, enables taking images of the bed surface. Two degradational laboratory experiments were conducted. In the first experiment the initial bed was composed of a bimodal mixture of gravel and sand and it was characterized by a stepwise downstream fining pattern and a downstream sand reach. Only the sand fraction was mobile. A static armor formed over the bimodal reach {{due to a lack of}} sediment supply and conditions of partial transport. The armoring over the bimodal upstream reach resulted in an abrupt spatial transition in mean grain size of the bed surface and in bed slope between the upstream reach and the downstream sand reach. The difference in the bed slope and so the flow depth between the two reaches led to the formation of an M 1 <b>backwater</b> <b>curve</b> over the bimodal reach. The streamwise increase of the flow depth and the associated decrease of the sediment mobility resulted in downstream fining over the upstream reach. Despite the steady water discharge the morphodynamic equilibrium state was characterized by the presence of a <b>backwater</b> <b>curve.</b> This was because partial transport conditions prevented the bimodal reach from establishing normal flow conditions. In this experiment partial transport conditions controlled the temporal changes of the considered sand-gravel reach. The laboratory experiment was reproduced using a numerical morphodynamic sandgravel model. The numerical model was based on the Hirano active layer model and the backwater equation. The detailed data on spatial and temporal changes of the bed surface texture measured using image analysis were of aid in calibrating the model, in particular in tuning the hiding coefficient in the sediment transport relation. We found a good agreement between measured and predicted data. In the second experiment we investigated the stability of an armor under high flow conditions. The armor was created under a low flow rate and a lack of sediment supply, using a trimodal mixture composed of sand and gravel. The increased water discharge induced a breakup of the armor, which reformed under continued peak flow conditions. The breakup occurred through the dislodgement of the coarse surface particles which then exposed the finer substrate. Consequently, the bed surface locally became finer, which allowed for some degradation. Yet quickly a new armor formed that was coarser than the initial one. The armor breakup corresponded to a sudden and local increase of the sediment transport rate that gradually decreased during armor reformation.

40|$|A flume {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} examine {{the evolution of a}} sand-gravel reach under a lack of sediment supply. A bed composed of a bimodal sediment mixture was installed with a uniform slope and an gradual fining pattern. At the upstream end of the flume the initial bed consisted of 100 % gravel, which decreased stepwise (10 % steps) in downstream direction until the location where the initial bed consisted of 100 % sand. The water discharge and downstream water level were constant and the sediment feed rate was equal to zero. New image analysis equipment was used to frequently measure the grain size distribution of the bed surface during the experiment over {{the entire length of the}} flume. The {{experiment was}} governed by bedload transport and subcritical flow. The flow rate was such that only sand was mobile (partial transport). This led to the washing out of sand from the upstream bimodal reach and its gradual coarsening. In this reach we observed the formation of a static armour layer, which resulted in a more abrupt transition in the mean grain size of the bed surface. The total amount of bed degradation slightly increased in streamwise direction over the bimodal reach, which was due to the streamwise increase of the sand fraction in the initial bed. The sand reach adjusted to the lack of sand supply by decreasing its slope and so its sand transport capacity (i. e. through decreasing the flow velocity). Consequently, the sand transport rate at the downstream end of the flume gradually reduced during the experiment. A morphodynamic steady state over a movable bed is generally governed by normal flow. In the present case, governed by partial transport conditions, the morphodynamic steady state is dominated by a <b>backwater</b> <b>curve.</b> This happens because under partial transport conditions the bed cannot (fully) adjust to the upstream water and sediment discharge. These experimental results were reproduced using a one-dimensional numerical model based on the St Venant-Hirano equations, although the effects of the temporal change in bed porosity were not considered in the model.

The design of the physical experiments requires choices about the geometry of the flume. The experiments were carried out with a straight flume and with a dividing wall.

The upstream boundary conditions are discharge and velocity distribution. The downstream boundary condition consisted of a fixed water level. The water level was kept constant along the natural slope of the surface. The experiments consist of taking velocity and bed level. The angle of attack and the penetration depth were chosen to be variable. The angle of attack was varied between 15 and 25 degrees. With these relatively small angles the screen acts as guidance for the flow, instead of an obstruction. The penetration depth was varied between 20 % and 60 % of the water column. The initial test run determined the optimal measurement duration and the initial equilibrium. Four representative cases have been described in detail, giving support to the general conclusions. The flow pattern changes under influence of the surface screen. The main flow direction is guided by the screen, introducing a transverse velocity at the surface. As flow continuity in the flume has to be maintained, the water near the bottom is forced to have a transverse velocity in opposite direction. Redistribution of the suspended transport and the bottom transport was induced. This generated locations were the actual transport did not meet the transport capacity, which gives rise to morphological changes. Next to the spiral motion the screen had an effect on the longitudinal flow velocities. The attacked side of the flume experiences a higher velocity, thereby having a higher transport capacity. This higher capacity gives rise to local erosion of the bed. At the unattacked side, sedimentation occurs, thereby rising the bed level. In the B-series of the experiment a dividing wall was added.

40|$|Introduction: The use of {{automatic}} control system for managing the conveyance and distribution of water in surface irrigation systems, {{as a means of}} improving the management and performance of these systems is essential. Automating networks using the programmable controller provide the implementation of a number of control ways according to different water delivery scenarios. Also the implementation of these systems using sensors and recording water levels by hydraulic devices can supply an accurate data collection of water distribution networks in the long term and can influence the decisions to manage the network. Control systems in irrigation canals include two parts: calculation for adjustment the structures (algorithms or control system software) and application the calculated settings on structures (hardware of control systems). The success of these parts is depending on the ability of control algorithm to determine the control parameters. Materials and Methods: Doosti irrigation network in the plains of Sarakhs is located in the northeast of Iran. In the end of the main canal, two canals has branched which named EPC and WPC 2. This study was performed on the EPC canal with the discharge and length of 4. 43 m 3 /s and 18. 7 km respectively. There are 15 duck-bill check structures along the EPC. Also 14 intake structures and secondary canals are responsible for water distribution between local water users. In this study, the performance of system identification process, SI, in estimation of coefficients of proportional-integral controller and improvement of adjusting the control algorithm was compared with trial and error process. This proportional-integral control algorithm was designed for EPC canal. The efficiency of algorithm was evaluated using the simulation results of several different choices of operating systems with SOBEK hydrodynamic model and computing evaluation indices of control systems. This model can simulate all kinds of structures in water conveyance and distribution networks. In addition to the integrity of this software, two proprietary approach of the model are ability to design the control algorithms for smart irrigation systems and the ability to integrate each of its modules with each other and increase compliance with real systems. Evaluation of designed control algorithm was done using the pattern of the one-month operation, with extreme daily variation to cover the most intense perturbations in canal. To evaluate the performance of the designed control algorithm for investigated scenarios in the canal, the performance evaluation indices of control systems were used. Results and Discussion: The results of SI process show that the delay time for the longest reach is greater than the other. Also the values of delay time show that the smaller discharges produce more delay time. By comparing the storage area for applied discharges for SI process, it was concluded that the amount of storage area for low flows is higher. Because for low flows with fixed target level in upstream the check structures, the length of <b>backwater</b> <b>curve</b> is more and consequently the amount of storage area would be higher.

40|$|In 2000 the Dutch {{government}} chose a {{new point}} of view for the Dutch rivers: “Room for the River”. This viewpoint {{is the basis for}} a new approach of high water protection in the Netherlands. Instead of strengthening and raising the dikes, solutions must be based on space and spatial quality. One of the suggested measures is the addition of secondary channels. The purpose of these channels is enlarging the conveyance area and the ecological role of the river. Maintaining the profile of these channels involves substantial financial consequences. Finding a sustainable solution for undesired erosion or sedimentation is the main focus of this study. The research question is stated as follows: “How can the undesired erosion or sedimentation in secondary channels be corrected with a temporary but sustainable solution in the form of surface screens?”. The main part of this study is an experimental study on the effects of surface screens on a mobile bed. The design of the physical experiments requires choices about the geometry of the flume. The experiments were carried out with a straight flume and with a dividing wall. Preparing the experiments requires information about the flume facility.

The use of a screen inside a channel has an advantage not to interfere with the navigation channel. The advantage of a screen in front of a bifurcation is influencing two channels simultaneously. One of the main disadvantages of the latter is the possibility of disturbing the delicate bifurcation relationship. When carefully implemented this effect can simultaneously be the main advantage of this screen layout, as the morphological response increases.

While the control provided by individual algorithms was not evaluated, studies were performed to illustrate inherent hydraulic limitations—the inability of canal pools to recover rapidly from disturbances or flow perturbations. Studies were performed in nondimensional form to develop {{a better understanding of how}} pool properties influence pool response. Three such studies were performed. First, nondimensional <b>backwater</b> <b>curves</b> were developed for a range of canal conditions. The second study involved the propagation of waves initiated at the upstream end of a canal pool, as this is influenced by downstream boundary conditions. Finally, the response of pools to downstream withdrawals was examined in terms of their sluggish recovery even when the correct flow change is applied upstream. These results will help in understanding how canal properties influence the ability of operators to effectively control a canal either manually or automatically, and should influence future design practices...|$|R
40|$|A 2 D {{numerical}} flow model, {{developed at}} the Research unit of Hydrology, Applied Hydrodynamics and Hydraulic Constructions at ULg, {{has been applied to}} flows in a macro-rough channel. The model solves the shallow water equations (SWE) with a two length scale, depth-integrated k-type approach for turbulence modeling. Data for the comparison have been provided by experiments conducted at the Laboratory of Hydraulic Constructions at EPFL. In the experiments with different non-prismatic channel configurations, namely large-scale cavities at the side walls, three different 2 D flow characteristics could be observed in cavities. With the used numerical model features, especially regarding turbulence and friction modeling, a single set of bottom and side wall roughness could be found for a large range of discharges investigated in a prismatic channel. For the macro rough configurations, the numerical model gives an excellent agreement between experimental and numerical results regarding <b>backwater</b> <b>curves</b> and flow patterns if the side wall cavities have low aspect ratios. For configurations with high aspect ratios, the head loss generated by the preservation of important recirculation gyres in the cavities is slightly underestimated. The results of the computations reveal clearly that the separation of turbulence sources in the mathematical model is of great importance. Indeed, the turbulence related to 2 D transverse shear effects and the 3 D turbulence, generated by bed friction, can have very different amplitude. When separating these two effects in the numerical models, most of the flow features observed experimentally can be reproduced accurately. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2001 This thesis {{presents}} general {{processes for}} applying mobile boundary models at coarse-bedded bridge crossings. To develop these processes, the research uses {{a series of}} case studies involving highway bridges that span coarse-bedded rivers (gravel, cobble beds). From the case studies, the thesis presents seven tables and charts describing the overall processes and criteria for applying mobile boundary models at coarse-bedded bridge crossings. These include the preferred physical attributes for using a mobile boundary model at a bridge site, the required fixed boundary analysis, {{an evaluation of the}} dominating morphological feature at the crossing (e. g., bridge opening), a mobile boundary model cost analysis, and the requirements for performing a mobile boundary analysis. The presented mobile boundary analysis also includes recommended values for various operational parameters. These parameters include time step, active layer thickness, sediment transport equation, and stream bed gradation. The research shows that mobile boundary models will produce lower bridge backwater elevations (water surface profiles) than those that fixed boundary models produce. This occurs when the bridge opening dominates the hydraulics at the crossing. To test for bridge dominance, the Froude value, Fu, upstream of the bridge site should not exceed the Froude value, Fb, at the bridge site. The research also shows that values of hydraulic parameters (e. g., bridge scour) from fixed boundary models are useful in obtaining a broad estimate of the reduction in backwater that a mobile boundary model might produce. The statistical relationship between fixed boundary hydraulic values and mobile boundary backwater elevations, however, is weak. This relationship, nevertheless, is qualitatively strong enough to indicate when to use a mobile boundary model. Finally, the research uses additional selected case studies to evaluate the water surface profile accuracy of mobile boundary models versus fixed boundary models. These case studies show that the mobile boundary model will produce a more accurate water surface profile than a fixed boundary model. However, in some instances the added accuracy of a mobile model may not produce <b>backwater</b> <b>curves</b> with more practical use than a fixed model in the hydraulic design of a bridge...|$|R
40|$|Variable {{effects of}} backwaters complicate the {{development}} of rating curves at hydrometric measurement stations. In areas influenced by <b>backwater,</b> single-parameter rating <b>curve</b> techniques are often inapplicable. To overcome this, several authors have advocated {{the use of an}} additional downstream level gauge to estimate the longitudinal surface level gradient, but this is cumbersome in a lowland meandering river with considerable transverse surface level gradients. Recent developments allow river flow to be continuously monitored through velocity measurements with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (H-ADCP), deployed horizontally at a river bank. This approach was adopted to obtain continuous discharge estimates at a cross-section in the River Mahakam at a station located about 300 km upstream of the river mouth in the Mahakam delta. The discharge station represents an area influenced by variable backwater effects from lakes, tributaries and floodplain ponds, and by tides. We applied both the standard index velocity method and a recently developed methodology to obtain a continuous time-series of discharge from the H-ADCP data. Measurements with a boat-mounted ADCP were used for calibration and validation of the model to translate H-ADCP velocity to discharge. As a comparison with conventional discharge estimation techniques, a stage-discharge relation using Jones formula was developed. The discharge rate at the station exceeded 3250 m 3 s&minus; 1 . Discharge series from a traditional stage-discharge relation did not capture the overall discharge dynamics, as inferred from H-ADCP data. For a specific river stage, the discharge range could be as high as 2000 m 3 s&minus; 1 , which is far beyond what could be explained from kinematic wave dynamics. Backwater effects from lakes were shown to be significant, whereas interaction of the river flow with tides may impact discharge variation in the fortnightly frequency band. Fortnightly tides cannot easily be isolated from river discharge variation, which features similar periodicities...|$|R
