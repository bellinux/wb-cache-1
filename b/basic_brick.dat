40|$|Abstract- In the Refractories world {{three decades}} ago, {{very few people}} were acquainted to silica fume and its usage. After a few years, it {{was used as an}} {{additive}} to brick. When added to high Alumina brick, mullite was formed in the matrix of the brick on firing, giving the brick good volume stability, strength and chemical resistance. When used in <b>basic</b> <b>brick,</b> high hot strengths resulted, at least at 2700 oF, which was about the limit of what could be tested. At the time it was only logical that silica fume would be used in brick not castables. Brick were used for all critical applications, no one would have considered using castables. In this paper we shall discuss the manufacturing, properties of silica fume and its effect on concrete after addition. Today’s refractory castables have gone beyond having “brick-like properties” to actually out performing brick in many applications.

40|$|Service {{discovery}} {{is one of}} the major challenges in the emerging area of Service Oriented Computing (SOC), which promotes the notion of service as the <b>basic</b> <b>brick</b> for the development of next generation distributed heterogeneous software systems. State-of-the-art matchmaking algorithms for Web services range from algorithms based on the DAML-S Service Profile to improved ones based on the DAML-S Service Model. In this paper we propose a new technique for Web service discovery which features a flexible matchmaking by exploiting DAML-S ontologies. Our algorithm allows for partially matched services to be discovered by addressing issues such as: (1) fine-grained matchmaking at the level of atomic processes rather than at the entire service level as in previous approaches, (2) multiple runs of services, and (3) the fact that non-trivial requests can only be satisfied collectively by a set of services rather than by a single execution of a single service. In this way we extend the matchmaking process between queries and advertisements from one-to-one to one-to-many...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA graph is {{matching}} covered if it connected, has {{at least}} two vertices and each of its edges is contained in a perfect matching. A 3 -connected graph G is a brick if, for any two vertices u and v of G, the graph G-{u,v} has a perfect matching. As shown by Lovász [Matching structure and the matching lattice, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 43 (1987) 187 – 222] every matching covered graph G may be decomposed, in an essentially unique manner, into bricks and bipartite graphs known as braces. The number of bricks resulting from this decomposition is denoted by b(G). The object {{of this paper is}} to present a recursive procedure for generating bricks. We define four simple operations that can be used to construct new bricks from given bricks. We show that all bricks may be generated from three <b>basic</b> <b>bricks</b> K 4, C¯ 6 and the Petersen graph by means of these four operations. In order to establish this, it turns out to be necessary to show that every brick G distinct from the three <b>basic</b> <b>bricks</b> has a thin edge, that is, an edge e such that (i) G-e is a matching covered graph with b(G-e) = 1 and (ii) for each barrier B of G-e, the graph G-e-B has precisely |B|- 1 isolated vertices, each of which has degree two in G-e. Improving upon a theorem proved in [M. H. de Carvalho, C. L. Lucchesi, U. S. R. Murty, On a conjecture of Lovász concerning bricks, I, The characteristic of a matching covered graph, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 85 (2002) 94 – 136; M. H. de Carvalho, C. L. Lucchesi, U. S. R. Murty, On a conjecture of Lovász concerning bricks, II, Bricks of finite characteristic, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 85 (2002) 137 – 180] we show here that every brick different from the three <b>basic</b> <b>bricks</b> has an edge that is thin. A cut of a matching covered graph G is separating if each of the two graphs obtained from G by shrinking the shores of the cut to single vertices is also matching covered. A brick is solid if it does not have any nontrivial separating cuts. Solid bricks have many interesting properties, but the complexity status of deciding whether a given brick is solid is not known. Here, by using our theorem on the existence of thin edges, we show that every simple planar solid brick is an odd wheel...|$|R

40|$|In {{biochemical}} systems, stochastic e↵ects can {{be caused}} by the presence of small numbers of certain reactant molecules. In this setting, discrete state-space and stochastic simulation approaches were proved to be more relevant than continuous state-space and deterministic ones. These stochastic models constitute the theory of stochastic reaction networks (SRNs). Furthermore, in some cases, the dynamics of fast and slow time scales can be well separated and this is characterized by what is called sti↵ness. For such problems, the existing discrete space-state stochastic path simulation methods, such as the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and the explicit tau-leap method, can be very slow. Therefore, implicit tau-leap approxima- tions were developed to improve the numerical stability and provide more e cient simulation algorithms for these systems. One of the interesting tasks for SRNs is to approximate the expected values of some observables of the process at a certain fixed time T. This is can be achieved using Monte Carlo (MC) techniques. However, in a recent work, Anderson and Higham in 2013, proposed a more computationally e cient method which combines multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) technique with explicit tau-leap schemes. In this MSc thesis, we propose new fast stochastic algorithm, particularly designed 5 to address sti↵ systems, for approximating the expected values of some observables of SRNs. In fact, we take advantage of the idea of MLMC techniques and drift-implicit tau-leap approximation to construct a drift-implicit MLMC tau-leap estimator. In addition to accurately estimating the expected values of a given observable of SRNs at a final time T, our proposed estimator ensures the numerical stability with a lower cost than the MLMC explicit tau-leap algorithm, for systems including simultane- ously fast and slow species. The key contribution of our work is the coupling of two drift-implicit tau-leap paths, which is the <b>basic</b> <b>brick</b> for constructing our proposed drift-implicit MLMC tau-leap estimator. As an example of sti↵ problem, we used the decaying-dimerizing reaction as a test example to show the advantage of our drift-implicit method over the explicit one.

We also illustrated in a second example how our drift-implicit MLMC tau-leap estimator can be forty times faster than the explicit MLMC...|$|E
