50|$|This was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, {{operated}} by a hydraulic controller. To change gears, the driver flicked a lever {{behind the steering wheel}} to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The hydraulic controller disengaged the clutch, engaged the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled by a centrifugal regulator sensing engine rpm and driven off the camshaft by a belt, the position of the butterfly valve in the carburettor (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the brake circuit. When the brake was pressed, the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop in idle throttle position also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following loss of system fluid), the clutch would disengage, to prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe <b>braking</b> <b>to</b> <b>standstill.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{expression}} [...] "1 g [...] " [...] {{means that}} for every second that elapses, velocity changes [...] meters per second (≡). This rate of change in velocity can also be denoted as [...] (meter per second) per second, or [...] For example: An acceleration of 1 g equates to a rate of change in velocity of approximately 35 km/h for each second that elapses. Therefore, if an automobile is capable of braking at 1 g and is traveling at 35 km/h it can <b>brake</b> <b>to</b> a <b>standstill</b> in one second and the driver will experience a deceleration of 1 g. The automobile traveling at three times this speed, 105 km/h, can <b>brake</b> <b>to</b> a <b>standstill</b> in three seconds.|$|R

500|$|A special runway will be {{required}} for launch: {{it needs to be}} reinforced to tolerate the high equivalent single wheel load; necessitated by the Skylon's 325 tonnes takeoff weight; it will need to have heat resistant sections {{at the start of the}} take-off run and at the rotation zone; and it will have to be [...] long to allow the Skylon to accelerate to its [...] rotation speed, yet still have [...] to abort the launch and <b>brake</b> <b>to</b> a <b>standstill</b> if required. The Skylon would be able to land on a [...] Code F civil runway.|$|R
50|$|Stellar {{mass loss}} {{produces}} {{a loss of}} angular momentum and this quickly brakes the rotation of massive stars. Very massive stars at near-solar metallicity should be <b>braked</b> almost <b>to</b> a <b>standstill</b> while still on the main sequence, while at SMC metallicity {{they can continue to}} rotate rapidly even at the highest observed masses. Rapid rotation of massive stars may account for the unexpected properties and numbers of SMC WR stars, for example their relatively high temperatures and luminosities.|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamic braking}} of {{induction}} motors is investigated with {{particular emphasis on}} the use o-f zero-sequence connections. The braking performance using both AC and DC supplies is compared. A mathematical model is developed to predict both the transient and steady-state zero-sequence <b>braking</b> performance. <b>To</b> ensure accurate calculations, a model is constructed {{to allow for the}} variation of secondary parameters with frequency due to the skin effect. A method for determining the zero-sequence parameters using locked rotor variable frequency data is presented. To measure the transient acceleration torque of the machine, a rotational accelerometer is developed from a small single-phase induction motor. Good correlation between measured and calculated results is achieved during switching transients for both current and torque. The zero-sequence braking performance is analysed quantitatively and found to be an attractive alternative. When an AC zero-sequence supply is used, <b>braking</b> is suited <b>to</b> situations where it is not essential <b>to</b> <b>brake</b> <b>to</b> a <b>standstill</b> and minimising cost is an important consideration. With a DC zero-sequence supply, the braking is effective down to zero speed and worthy of serious consideration in situations where DC injection braking is currently used...|$|R

5000|$|The SW20 {{garnered}} generally favorable reviews {{during its}} production life, with various sources complementing the styling, power, and responsive handling. Car and Driver noted the revised SW20's <b>braking</b> capabilities <b>to</b> be superb, stating that 70 mph <b>to</b> <b>standstill</b> {{could be done}} in 157 feet, rivaling that of the Honda NSX. Former Top Gear host and racing driver Tiff Needell commends the SW20's handling having said that it [...] "encourages you to drive with enthusiasm" [...] in a review back in 1990. He does note however, that the sudden transition from understeer to oversteer may be startling for some people.|$|R

50|$|A {{line lock}} is {{a device that}} allows the front <b>brakes</b> <b>to</b> lock {{independently}} of the rear brakes via a switch.

This allows the driver to spin the rear wheels without wasting the rear brakes. This method {{is referred to as}} line lock and is popular among enthusiasts who like to do burnouts frequently.|$|R
