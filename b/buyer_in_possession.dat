50|$|Again, {{the seller}} is {{normally}} {{the owner of}} the property. He is expected to transfer this ownership as part of the sale. What happens, however, in the situation where someone bona fide believes he is {{the owner of the}} thing he is selling, but in fact is not? Such sales are, of course, valid, but ever since Roman days the law has said that a person who buys and takes possession of property from such a seller has no action unless and until he is threatened with eviction by someone with better legal title to the property (usually the true owner). The action arises in such circumstances out of {{what is known as the}} warranty against eviction. The warranty requires of the seller that he do whatever is legally possible to protect the <b>buyer</b> <b>in</b> his <b>possession</b> of the res vendita. An inability to do so renders him liable under this warranty. The warranty is obliquely re-articulated in the Consumer Protection Act.|$|R
5000|$|The RSM calculates, {{for each}} sub-market , an optimal offer , {{calculated}} as follows:The offer [...] {{is applied to}} the <b>buyers</b> <b>in</b> , i.e.: each <b>buyer</b> [...] who said that [...] receives the offered allocation and pays each <b>buyer</b> <b>in</b> [...] who said that [...] do not receive and do not pay anything. The offer [...] {{is applied to the}} <b>buyers</b> <b>in</b> [...] in a similar way.|$|R
5000|$|For each <b>buyer</b> <b>in</b> group 1, the {{empirical}} distribution function is [...] "0.09 chance of $10 and 0.91 chance of $1" [...] so the Bayesian-optimal price is $1. For each <b>buyer</b> <b>in</b> group 2, {{the empirical}} distribution function is [...] "0.1 chance of $10 and 0.9 chance of $1" [...] so the Bayesian-optimal price is $10. The <b>buyers</b> <b>in</b> group 1 pay $1 and the <b>buyers</b> <b>in</b> group 2 {{do not want}} to pay $10, so we end up with a profit of $10. In contrast, a price of $1 for everyone would have given us a profit of $101. Our profit is less than %10 of the optimum. This example can be made arbitrarily bad.|$|R
