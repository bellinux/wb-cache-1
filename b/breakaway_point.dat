40|$|The {{collision}} {{efficiency of}} Brownian coagulation for monodisperse aerosol par-ticles {{in the transition}} regime is considered. A new expression for collision effi-ciency is proposed {{taking into account the}} influence of tangential relative motion when two particles get close enough during the diffusion process. The <b>breakaway</b> <b>point</b> from which the theory of near continuum regime no longer applies can thus be obtained easily. A comparison with experimental measurements shows the ac-curacy of the results predicted by the new theory. Key words: collision efficiency, tangential motion, breakaway poin...|$|E
40|$|In {{studying}} the diffraction of shock waves around various two-dimensional obstacles we {{have observed that}} flow separation {{and the formation of}} vortices contributes in an important way to transient loading of the obstacle. The cases of a cylinder and semicylinder are especially interesting because the <b>breakaway</b> <b>point</b> is not clearly defined as it is for objects having sharp corners. Accordingly a number of experiments {{have been made in the}} shock tube to observe the influence of Reynolds number and Mach number on the transient flow patterns about a cylinder and about a semicylinder mounted on a smooth plane. Some differences might be anticipated since the plane would impose a symmetry on the flow and produce a viscous boundary layer for which there is no counterpart with the cylinder. In the course of these experiments it was noted that a condition of steady subsonic flow about both the cylinder and semicylinder was approached. Thus a comparison with von Karrnan's theoretical calculation of the drag on a cylinder, from certain characteristics of its wake or "vortex street", was undertaken...|$|E

40|$|In {{linear control}} systems Evans rules {{are used to}} {{manually}} sketch the root locus. One of these rules concerns identifying break-in or <b>breakaway</b> <b>points.</b> Multitude of analytical methods can provide such break points. However even to verify the existence of break points each method requires solving an equation. In this paper using Bolzano theorem we propose a method of checking the existence of break points in a specific interval without need to solve any equation...|$|R
40|$|The same {{complete}} {{root locus}} {{is generated by}} all loop transfer functions whose numerator and denominator are linear combinations of the polynomials n(s) and d(s). Therefore, a complete root locus can be constructed starting from different sets of arrival and departure points. This property {{can be used to}} find the asymptotes of the negative locus for an exactly proper loop transfer function and to determine the configuration of the locus branches around the <b>breakaway</b> <b>points.</b> The root-locus invariance property can also be exploited to characterize a stabilization procedure leading to an exactly proper loop transfer function whose Nyquist diagram travels along a circle centered at - 1 + j...|$|R
40|$|The {{well-known}} root-locus {{method is}} developed for special subset of linear time-invariant systems known as fractional-order systems. Transfer functions {{of these systems}} are rational functions with polynomials of rational powers of the Laplace variable s. Such systems are defined on a Riemann surface because of their multivalued nature. A set of rules for plotting the root loci on the first Riemann sheet is presented. The important features of the classical root-locus method such as asymptotes, roots condition on the real axis, and <b>breakaway</b> <b>points</b> are extended to fractional case. It is also shown that the proposed method can assess the closed-loop stability of fractional-order systems {{in the presence of}} a varying gain in the loop. Three illustrative examples are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm...|$|R
30|$|Considering the {{structure}} effect of tunnel stability in western mining of China, three typical kinds of numerical model were respectively built as follows {{based on the}} strain softening constitutive model and linear elastic–perfectly plastic model for soft rock and interface: R–M, R–Cs–M and R–Cw–M. Calculation results revealed that the stress–strain relation and failure characteristics of the three models vary between each other. The combination model without interface or with a strong interface presented continuous failure, while weak interface exhibited ‘cut off’ effect. Thus, conceptual models of bi-material model and bi-body model were established. Then numerical experiments of tri-axial compression were carried out for the two models. The relationships between stress evolution, failure zone and deformation rate fluctuations {{as well as the}} displacement of interface were detailed analyzed. Results show that two <b>breakaway</b> <b>points</b> of deformation rate actually demonstrate the starting and penetration of the main rupture, respectively. It is distinguishable due to the large fluctuation. The bi-material model shows general continuous failure while bi-body model shows ‘V’ type shear zone in weak body and failure in strong body near the interface due to the interface effect. With the increasing of confining pressure, the ‘cut off’ effect of weak interface is not obvious. These conclusions lay the theoretical foundation for further development of constitutive model for soft rock–coal combination body.|$|R
50|$|The last type of climber is the {{breakaway}} {{specialist who}} can ride aggressively with many attacks and sustain their lead over ascents, descents, and flats. Famous examples include Laurent Jalabert and Richard Virenque {{both of whom}} earned their King of the Mountains jerseys in the Tour de France by day-long <b>breakaways</b> amassing <b>points</b> at every summit. Most notably, Laurent Jalabert started {{his career as a}} sprinter but later transformed himself into a different type of rider. Many riders who are primarily time-trialists have also been able to compete in everything but the steepest climbs because of their good power-to-weight ratio. Tour de France winners Miguel Indurain, Jan Ullrich and Bradley Wiggins were primarily time-trialists but were also {{among the best in the}} mountain stages during the years in which they won the Tour de France.|$|R
5000|$|Wildcard teams [...] and [...] {{were active}} in early {{breakaway}} attempts, but no riders got clear until over an hour spent racing and 45 km were covered. Daniele Contrini instigated the days <b>breakaway</b> at that <b>point,</b> and Marco Pinotti, Christophe Kern, Hubert Schwab, and Luis Felipe Laverde joined him. The breakaway was riding cohesively through the Monte Terminillo climb, and the -led main field did not chase very hard to bring them back. Pinotti was the best-placed man in the break, 311" [...] back of race leader Danilo Di Luca on the day. The groups advantage quickly exceeded three minutes, meaning Pinotti stood to become race leader if they stayed away. Laverde took the mountains points {{at the top of}} the Terminillo, and took the green jersey on the podium at days end.|$|R
40|$|Smoking flares {{have always}} {{represented}} the visible symbols of pollution escaping from the world's oil and petrochemical industries. Only in recent years, however, has the increasing size of such complexes begun to cause acute environmental problems. During normal operations, these valuable off-gases {{ought to be}} conserved, either by gas liquifaction or by re-injection plants but, in an emergency, flares remain necessities as 'plant safety valves'. Essentially, smokeless flaring is an aerodynamic mixing problem. The large volume air requirement for clean combustion has to be induced into the flame by some kind of high pressure gas or steam entrainment system. A novel method of effecting this mixing, rapidly, is to utilise the 'Coanda Effect'. This is the name given to the tendency of a fluid jet to adhere to an adjacent surface, thereby causing enhanced entrainment, actually up to 25 times the original air inflow into the jet. The object {{of this research was}} to study and thus improve the performance of one design of Coanda, external surface, steam flare, developed and marketed by BP under the trade name Stedair. The investigation of this flare system was conducted in two parts; physical modelling of the entrainment at the flare tip, followed on by confirmatory measurements, on a 76 mm pilot scale, propylene doped, methane-steam flare, A slice (two-dimensional) water model of a Stedair flare tip was constructed, to examine the effectiveness of Coanda surface geometry, as an entrainer and mixer. The neutralisation reaction between solutions of HCl and NaOH was used to imitate the combustion reactions between oxygen and hydrocarbons, the neutralisation being made visible by the use of phenolphalcin as an indicator. Adjustment of the concentrations cuid flows simulates fuel stoichiemetry and excess air requirements, producing a 'flare envelope' corresponding to the 'mixed is burnt criterion. The second phase of the investigation consisted of a series of combustion tests on the largest (76 mm) Stedair steam flare that could b 6 safely operated within a high ceiling (7. 6 m) laboratory. Temperature and CO profiles within the flame were measured on 3 flare heads, with 4 slot widths/head and at 3 steam flows/slot width, the gas flow being kept constant. Smoke Points, Blow-off and Coanda <b>Breakaway</b> <b>Points</b> were also measured at varying gas flows. The Coanda principle is inherently such an excellent entrainment device that combustion on these flare tips is nearly always good, provided that the jet slot width remains uniform. Whilst noise and radiation levels can only be measured on real flares, combustion quality and entrainment rates are best measured on slice water models of such flares. The experimental flare built by the author demonstrated this point very well. The pulsations and oscillations of this turbulent jet, even in the wind-free laboratory environment made obtaining consistent measurements very difficult. A Coanda flare behaves like an enclosed rather than a free jet, thus the similarity criteria developed by Craya and Curtet can be applied and when it is, Jenkins and Coworkers have shown that, water model results do correspond to those measured on real flare trials...|$|R

2500|$|The opening road {{stage of}} the 2012 Vuelta saw the riders head south from Pamplona, via a loop around Tafalla – where the race's first {{intermediate}} sprint point was held – and the first categorised climb, the third-category Alto de la Chapela, before heading towards Viana. In Viana itself, there was an intermediate sprint point on the first passage through the town, before the finish second time around. With most of the [...] parcours being flat, it was expected to ultimately result in a sprint finish at the stage end. Three riders – Spanish pairing Javier Aramendia of [...] and [...] rider Javier Chacón, along with Mikhail Ignatiev (...) – went clear around [...] {{after the start of}} the stage, making the early breakaway from the field, and the trio managed to extend their advantage over the main field to around five minutes. Niki Terpstra had also {{been a part of the}} <b>breakaway</b> at one <b>point,</b> but as he trailed overnight leader Jonathan Castroviejo of the [...] by just ten seconds, the breakaway were not allowed to gain a substantial advantage at that point. Terpstra ultimately dropped back into the main field to allow the gap to increase.|$|R
500|$|Stage {{thirteen}} saw the escapees {{being brought}} inside the one kilometer to go marker (known as the flamme rouge). Greg Van Avermaet of [...] took the uphill victory {{ahead of the}} chasing Sagan. On stage fourteen, a twenty-four rider breakaway reached the final climb, the Côte de la Croix Neuve. After the breakaway had fractured, Thibaut Pinot and Romain Bardet led over the summit, before Steve Cummings of [...] overtook them to take the victory at Brenoux Airport on the plateau above Mende. Sagan {{was part of the}} <b>breakaway,</b> amassing maximum <b>points</b> at the intermediate sprint. Over four minutes after Cummings had finished, Froome outsprinted Quintana while the other general classification favourites were slightly distanced. Quintana moved into second place overall, displacing Van Garderen. Stage fifteen had for principal difficulty the [...] climb, which saw most of the sprinters succeeding at passing the climb in the lead group, with the notable exception of Cavendish. Greipel won his third stage of the Tour, followed by John Degenkolb and Alexander Kristoff, respectively. On the next stage, featuring the Col de Manse as the final climb, Rubén Plaza (...) escaped the leading group of breakaway riders on the ascent. Sagan chased him down the descent, but to no avail as Plaza soloed to victory in Gap. The next day was the second rest day, spent in Gap.|$|R
2500|$|In the Tour de France, {{after he}} {{suffered}} a flat tire and caught {{back up to the}} 25 rider lead group, Sagan took second position on Stage 2, where André Greipel beat him by a whisker. On the fourth Stage featuring cobbles, Sagan sprinted to a third position after protecting his leader Contador. On the fifth stage, he came in second again to Greipel after having made a late surge for the line. He had to settle for second again on the sixth stage, after Zdenek Stybar went solo on the last small climb before the finish. On the next stage he finished third to Cavendish and Greipel. He was second again on Stage 13, finishing in the wheel of Greg Van Avermaet. On the next stage, Sagan was part of the <b>breakaway,</b> amassing maximum <b>points</b> at the intermediate sprint and finishing fifth. On Stage 15, Sagan featured again in the breakaway and took fourth position in the final sprint. He had the 'most combative' award for his efforts. On the next stage, featuring the Category 2 Col de Manse near the finish line, Rubén Plaza (...) escaped the leading group on the latter difficulty. Sagan chased him down the descent, but to no avail as Plaza soloed to victory. Sagan came in second and was awarded 'most combative' of the day again. Sagan amassed five second places in this Tour, and won the green jersey by a margin of 66 points over Greipel.|$|R
