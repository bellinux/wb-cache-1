50|$|Cable lacing uses a thin cord, {{traditionally}} made of waxed linen, to bind {{together a}} group of cables using a series of running lockstitches.

50|$|The art {{and history}} of tassels are known by its French name, passementerie, or Posamenten {{as it was called}} in German. The {{military}} output of the artisans called passementiers (ornamental <b>braid,</b> <b>lace,</b> cord, or trimmings makers) is evident in catalogs of various military uniform and regalia makers of centuries past. The broader art form of passementerie, with its divisions of Decor, Clergy and Nobility, Upholstery, Coaches and Livery, and Military, is covered in a few books on that subject, none of which are in English.|$|R

50|$|Making <b>tape</b> <b>laces</b> was {{a popular}} craft and {{patterns}} were widely available in shops and magazines. However, <b>tape</b> <b>lace</b> was also developed on a professional basis in some places, such as Branscombe in Devon.|$|R

For an oval rug the center braid should be one inch longer than the width-length in feet. example 2' x 4' rug center strip would be 2'2" [...] long. The center <b>braid</b> is <b>laced</b> together and new strips are sewn on to make the <b>braid</b> longer as <b>lacing</b> continues.|$|R

5000|$|Bobbin <b>tape</b> <b>lace</b> is {{bobbin lace}} where {{the design is}} formed {{of one or more}} tapes curved so they make an {{attractive}} pattern. The tapes are made {{at the same time as}} the rest of the lace, and are joined to each other, or themselves, using a crochet hook. [...] The tapes are made curved, and by hand, using bobbin lace techniques. This should be distinguished from mixed <b>tape</b> <b>lace,</b> which is made using an existing straight tape, often machine made.|$|R

50|$|Many other laces have traits {{inherited}} from freehand lace, for example, the patterns {{and the working}} of the <b>braids</b> in Milanese <b>lace,</b> and the grounds without pins and the exchange of workers in linen stitch {{in some of the}} Flemish laces.|$|R
40|$|Volume 1 of the 16 th century {{pattern book}} 2 ̆ 2 Le Pompe 2 ̆ 2 was printed by the Sessa {{brothers}} for Matio Pagano in 1557. Volume 2 appeared in 1560 {{with a new}} set of patterns. These works are among the earliest existing devoted entirely to bobbinlace. The patterns are drawings meant to be interpreted by the lacemaker. Most are highly adaptable to the plaited techniques we now associate with Venice. But more flowing designs are also present (fig 1), and seem to point the way toward <b>tape</b> <b>lace</b> development, or perhaps a side branch that was not fully developed in subsequent years. Little lace from this period survives, and it has been a challenge for modern lacemakers to interpret the more advanced patterns using modern techniques. This {{may not be the best}} approach. A new example has come to light which exactly copies one of the Le Pompe designs (fig 2), even matching the scale of the original plate. The piece is of fine linen and of a surprisingly advanced technique bearing little resemblance to modern interpretations. This paper will present a technical analysis of the piece, compared and contrasted to contemporary plaited <b>laces,</b> later <b>tape</b> <b>laces,</b> and modern attempts at copying such designs...|$|R
