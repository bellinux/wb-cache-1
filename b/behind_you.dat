A group of volunteer riders called WARBYs (We Are Right <b>Behind</b> <b>You)</b> ride throughout the field, providing emergency assistance for bicycle breakdowns and rider difficulties. A number of sag wagons accompany the ride to pick up riders and bikes {{who are unable to}} continue due to their bicycle being beyond roadside repair, injury, sickness, or general weariness.|$|E
25|$|The group {{took the}} show on tour {{for the first time}} in 2001, using a mixture of old and new material. In early 2005 a special one-off sketch was {{broadcast}} on the BBC for Comic Aid, a charity benefit for the tsunami disaster. In this, two of the most popular characters, Tubbs and Papa Lazarou, kidnapped Miranda Richardson. A feature-length film, The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse, was released on 3 June 2005. Later in the same year, the League toured the UK with their new pantomime-themed show, The League of Gentlemen Are <b>Behind</b> <b>You,</b> which ran from October to mid-December.|$|E
25|$|The series {{ended in}} 2002, and was {{followed}} by a film (The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse) and a stage production (The League of Gentlemen Are <b>Behind</b> <b>You!)</b> in 2005. Shearsmith and Pemberton later collaborated to create another dark comedy series, Psychoville (2009); Mark Gatiss appeared in one episode. The three also performed together in the fourth series of Horrible Histories, in which they play American film producers who hear movie pitches from historical figures. Shearsmith and Pemberton also wrote and starred in the black comedy anthology series Inside No. 9, which premiered on BBC Two in 2014.|$|E

You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look <b>behind</b> <b>you,</b> you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E

500|$|For the {{performance}} of [...] "Paparazzi", Gaga had collaborated with her Haus of Gaga creative partner Matthew [...] "Matty Dada" [...] Williams. She had a different vision {{for it in the}} beginning. Dada thought that Gaga should wear her hair braided, which Gaga had never done before. Dada's explanation for the concept was the look of Rapunzel, the fairy-tale character. He felt that [...] "it's something people deeply understand. And when you're wearing sunglasses on a scaffolding piece with a giant alien dancing <b>behind</b> <b>you,</b> I promised [...] it's not going to look like Rapunzel.'" ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} year of {{operational}} service, Hartmann felt a distinct lack of respect towards Soviet pilots. Most Soviet fighters did not even have proper gunsights, and their pilots were forced to draw one on the windscreen by hand: [...] "In the early days, incredible as it may seem, {{there was no reason}} for you to feel fear if the Russian fighter was <b>behind</b> <b>you.</b> With their hand-painted gunsights they couldn't pull the lead properly (deflection shooting) or hit you." [...] Hartmann also considered the Bell P-39 Airacobra, the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, and the Hawker Hurricane to be inferior to the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 and Bf109, although they did provide the Soviets with valuable gunsight technology.|$|E
500|$|Kraft could, however, {{be a tough}} taskmaster, {{making it}} clear that there was no place in the flight {{operations}} division for those who {{failed to live up to}} his exacting standards. [...] "To err is human," [...] went one of his favorite sayings, [...] "but to do so more than once is contrary to Flight Operations Directorate policy." [...] Subordinates who seriously displeased Kraft could find themselves deprived of the opportunity to make it up to him. Kraft possessed the power to end careers at Johnson Space Center; as mission controller Sy Liebergot recalled, [...] "if he was <b>behind</b> <b>you,</b> you had as much leverage as you needed; if he was against you, you were dead meat." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrical {{process was}} a {{collaborative}} effort consisting of Vinnie, Darrell, and Lachman. Themes explored on the album included the brothers' experiences, Darrell commented, [...] "the crumbling of one empire and then starting over... So {{there are a lot}} of lyrics about being reborn in a sense, about it being a new day, moving forward, letting go of the past and becoming something new." [...] This is exemplified in the songs [...] "Reborn", [...] "Wake up", and [...] "Breathing New Life". [...] "Blunt Force Trauma" [...] is about when someone or something comes up <b>behind</b> <b>you</b> when you least expect it, [...] "it could be a situation in your life, it could be a person you know with a beer bottle".|$|E

500|$|Killing Mr. Griffin {{was first}} {{published}} in April 1978 by Little, Brown and Company in hardcover. In October 2010, Little, Brown reissued the novel in paperback with updates to modernize some of the content. Killing Mr. Griffin, along with I Know What You Did Last Summer and Don't Look <b>Behind</b> <b>You,</b> were the first group of ten different titles that were updated and reissued with these changes. An audiobook was released by Listening Library in 1986, and another, read by Ed Sala, was released by Recorded Books in 1998. A reviewer from AudioFile felt that Sala's narration was effective, although occasionally he [...] "seems to lose concentration and expression." [...] A 2010 audiobook, narrated by Dennis Holland, was published by Hachette Audio and features the modernized text.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{recording}} Spiritual Machines, percussionist Jeremy Taggart suffered a serious ankle injury during a mugging while walking his dog. While he recovered, Taggart's friend Matt Cameron, former drummer for Soundgarden and current drummer for Pearl Jam, filled in for Taggart on the tracks [...] "Right <b>Behind</b> <b>You</b> (Mafia)" [...] and [...] "Are You Sad?", which Taggart had already written the drum parts for. When the final tracks were ready for mixing, the band shopped around before finding a producer they wanted. The album was mixed in Atlanta, Georgia by Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam's long time producer. [...] "It was an amazing experience working with Brendan, someone who immediately understood {{what we were trying}} to do and was able to capture exactly how we heard this album," [...] noted Maida.|$|E
500|$|Geoff Mayfield, Billboards {{director}} of charts, {{pointed to a}} combination of factors in explaining Simpson's success with Autobiography. He described Simpson as the [...] "right thing at the right time" [...] and said: [...] "The MTV show is a huge catalyst, radio jumped all over the song, and her famous sister opened the door. If Jessica never happened, then Ashlee doesn't get her own show and this album doesn't happen." [...] Zena Burns of Teen People, while noting the importance of effective promotion and Simpson's connection to Jessica, stressed the appeal of [...] "Pieces of Me" [...] in explaining her success: [...] "Ashlee has an amazing promotional machine, and it doesn't hurt to have Jessica and MTV <b>behind</b> <b>you,</b> but she also came out with an insanely catchy pop single." [...] From July 13 to July 20, the week prior to Autobiographys release, MTV.com's [...] "The Leak" [...] featured the album for streaming on its website. Autobiography drew 2.66 million requested streams during the time period, breaking a record previously held by Britney Spears' 2003 album In the Zone.|$|E

500|$|Despite being a World Cup {{winner in}} the {{previous}} summer, Banks was dropped {{towards the end of}} the 1966–67 season in favour of highly promising teenage reserve Peter Shilton. Manager Matt Gillies was blunt, telling Banks [...] "we [...] think your best days are <b>behind</b> <b>you,</b> and you should move on". Teammate Richie Norman told Banks that Gillies was pressured into the decision, Shilton having told the board he would leave the club unless he was given first team football. Banks was transfer listed at £50,000, the same price the club received for Derek Dougan in March 1967. However, many of the big clubs were unwilling to spend such a sum on a goalkeeper. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly showed strong interest, but could not convince the club's board of directors to agree to such a large fee for a goalkeeper. West Ham United manager Ron Greenwood was prepared to match the fee, but instead signed Kilmarnock's Bobby Ferguson for £65,000 because he had already agreed terms with Kilmarnock and did not want to go back on his word. Terms were instead agreed with Stoke City, a mid-table First Division side.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{subsequently}} fired {{her father}} as her manager and employed John McClain, then A Records' {{senior vice president}} of artists and repertoire and general manager. Commenting on the decision, she stated, [...] "I just {{wanted to get out of}} the house, get out from under my father, which was one of the most difficult things that I had to do, telling him that I didn't want to work with him again." [...] Joseph Jackson resented John McClain for what he saw as an underhanded attempt to steal his daughter's career out from under him, stating, [...] "I've worked hard for my family. The problem comes, though, when others come in <b>behind</b> <b>you</b> and try to steal them away. The wheels have already been set for Janet Jackson. Anyone who jumps on now will be getting a free ride." [...] McClain responded by saying [...] "I'm not trying to pimp Janet Jackson or steal her away from her father." [...] He subsequently introduced her to the songwriting/production duo of James [...] "Jimmy Jam" [...] Harris III and Terry Lewis, former Prince associates and ex-members of The Time.|$|E
500|$|The band {{contacted}} local Toronto artist Oli Goldsmith {{who happened}} to be reading the same book, to create the artwork for the upcoming album. In total, he made around 200 paintings relating to the project, many of which were used for the album art, promotional singles and the band's website. Based on the success of that commission, the record label asked him to also create and direct music videos for the singles [...] "In Repair" [...] and [...] "Right <b>Behind</b> <b>You</b> (Mafia)", which took his paintings and brought them to life with animation and stylized live motion. His artwork was described as [...] "Integrating photographs, logos, television images, signs, as well as a variety of written forms, such as epigrams and poetry, Goldsmith's art juxtaposes the unexpected, resulting in pieces that are bold, colourful, and energetic." [...] When the album insert is unfolded, it reveals a surrealistic panorama that appears to be set in a hospital. The official photo shoot for Spiritual Machines took place on October 7, 2000 on the sixth floor of St. Joseph's Health Centre in Toronto, formerly an intensive-care unit.|$|E

500|$|The {{lead off}} single for Spiritual Machines was [...] "In Repair". It was only {{promoted}} in Canada and though reaching {{number one on}} the Canadian Rock Radio charts, quickly fell off the charts shortly after its November 15, 2000 release. While the single was a failure in the United States, the music video, directed by Oli Goldsmith won multiple awards at the MuchMusic Video Awards including Best Video and Best Director. The second single was [...] "Life", released shortly after the album's Canadian release in December 2000. It was the only single that was commercially released, in Australia (EPK 6718742). It fared better on the charts, reaching number 27 on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart on March 10, 2001 after 13 weeks. In Canada, the song peaked at number two on the Canadian Rock Radio charts while the music video eventually reached {{number one on the}} MuchMusic Countdown. The third and final single was [...] "Right <b>Behind</b> <b>You</b> (Mafia)". By this time, Spiritual Machines was proving itself to be commercial failure in the States. The release of the single, set to be in June 2001, was aborted and the promotional copies were instead distributed to the band's fan club. The Oli Goldsmith directed music video's release was also cancelled and the video has not been seen until recently when it was released on the band's official website.|$|E
500|$|In her 2007 book, It's Not My Fault They Print Them, Catherine Deveny slates Paul and Dennis' acting ability stating: [...] "Stefan Dennis as the mustache-twirling panto villain Paul Robinson, is a genius. I {{just wanted}} to yell out 'He's <b>behind</b> <b>you,</b> he's behind you!' It takes sheer {{brilliance}} {{to be able to}} act that badly". Andrew Mercado, author of Super Aussie Soaps, describes Paul as being very similar to fictional character J. R. Ewing. Paul is referred to in Emily Barr's fictitious novel [...] "Out of My Depth", in which character Amanda is watching Neighbours, with scenes featuring Paul and Gail receiving disapproval from Harold, Amanda opines that she believes the couple are in love. Jaci Stephen writing for the Daily Mail commented on Paul's obsession with Rebecca stating: [...] "You can't help feeling that nothing short of a stake through the heart is going to keep Paul out of Rebecca's life." [...] Stephen later said [...] "Taking advice from Paul is like asking Charlie Sheen to be your spirit guide." [...] Paul Kalina of The Age said Dennis as Paul lightens things up and he prances about like [...] "a pantomime villain minus the moustache and cape." [...] Kalina added [...] "Erinsborough just would not be the same without him." [...] A TVTimes columnist stated [...] "He's no Brad Pitt and he's a devious beggar at the best of times, but Paul Robinson doesn't half get the ladies." ...|$|E
500|$|Foster {{signed for}} League Two side Rotherham United on 20 June 2011. He signed a one-year {{contract}} with the club, with an option of a second year. Foster made his debut for the club in a 3–0 home victory against Gillingham on 27 August 2011, coming on as an 84th-minute substitute with Rotherham already holding a three-goal advantage. After making no further first-team appearances the following month, Foster was made available for loan by manager Andy Scott. Scott stated Foster lacked both desire and fitness since signing for the club — [...] "If {{you want to be}} match fit, you get yourself match fit. You can work in training, you can stay <b>behind,</b> <b>you</b> have days off, you can get yourself fit. Luke has not been in the side and that tells you everything you need to know". However, no loan move materialised, and Foster made his second appearance for Rotherham in a 3–3 away draw at Morecambe on 25 October 2011. He appeared as a 27th-minute substitute in the club's following match four days later, a 1–1 draw against Northampton Town, and subsequently made his first start in a 2–0 home victory over Aldershot Town on 5 November — Rotherham's first win in 10 matches. In December 2011, Rotherham manager Andy Scott revealed that Foster would miss the rest of the 2011–12 season {{as a result of a}} cruciate ligament damage sustained in a match against Hereford United on 10 December 2011. He was released by Rotherham in May 2012, having made six appearances for the club.|$|E
