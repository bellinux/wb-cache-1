5|$|Raccoons {{were first}} hunted <b>by</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> who {{harvested}} the common animals both for meat and fur. British and European settlers in North America later adopted the practice.|$|E
5|$|A settler named Dan Jones {{was killed}} by Indians on Tangascootack Creek in late fall 1777. In 1854, James Wilson {{discovered}} several crudely constructed crucibles in a place known as the Rock Cavern on Tangascootack Creek. They were made <b>by</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> and had been used for smelting.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{was also}} {{appointed}} as the colonel of the Frederick County militia.

5|$|The papery bark of {{the white}} birch tree (Betula papyrifera) was used {{extensively}} <b>by</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> Wigwams were covered by it and canoes were constructed from it. Other uses included food containers, hunting and fishing equipment, musical instruments, toys and sledges. Nowadays, bark chips, a by-product of the timber industry, are used as a mulch and as a growing medium for epiphytic plants that need a soil-free compost.|$|E
5|$|The team's president, Bruce Allen, {{addressed}} a letter dated May 23, 2014, to Senator Reid repeating {{the position that}} the name was originated <b>by</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> to refer to themselves, that the logo was also designed and approved by Native American leaders, and {{that the vast majority of}} both Native Americans and the public do not find the name offensive.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{was first}} used in ancient Britain in about the 3rd or 2nd Century BC. In North America, copper mining began with {{marginal}} workings <b>by</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> Native copper {{is known to have}} been extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600. Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production did not start until the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|De Le√≥n later rescued L'Archeveque and his {{companion}} Jacques Grollet. On interrogation, the men maintained that over 100 of the French settlers {{had died of}} smallpox, and the others had been killed <b>by</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> The only people known to have survived the final attack were the Talon children, who had been adopted by the Karankawa. According to the children, the settlement had been attacked around Christmas of 1688, and all the remaining settlers had been killed.|$|E
5|$|Floyd {{was born}} at Floyds Station, Virginia, near what is now Louisville, Kentucky. His parents were pioneer John Floyd, who was killed <b>by</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> twelve days before his son's birth, and Jane Buchanan. His first cousin was Charles Floyd, {{the only member of}} the Lewis and Clark Expedition to die. In a letter dated 15 December 1830, Sam Houston stated that Floyd was the first cousin of another Lewis and Clark Explorer, Nathaniel Pryor.|$|E
5|$|Mainstream American cuisine {{is similar}} to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain {{products}} made of wheat flour and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed <b>by</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> and early European settlers. These home grown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays; Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the remains}} of brain cases found in shell middens are broken {{and many of the}} bones found exhibit cut marks, it is assumed that the sea mink was hunted <b>by</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> for food, and {{possibly}} for exchange and ceremonial purposes. One study looking at the remains in shell middens in Penobscot Bay reported that sea mink craniums were intact, more so than that of other animals found, implying that they were specifically placed there. Males were more often collected than females.|$|E
5|$|Solomon Creek {{was first}} settled <b>by</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> around 8000 to 6000 B.C.E. A settler {{arrived at the}} {{confluence}} of the creek with the Susquehanna River by 1774. In the 1800s, more people began arriving in the watershed to exploit its natural resources. Anthracite mining was especially prevalent in the watershed in the 19th and 20th centuries, to the point that numerous streams were altered or destroyed and the Laurel Run mine fire started.|$|E
5|$|There is archaeological {{evidence}} that Native Americans {{had been using}} the area for at least 8,500 years before present, and had been present at Cascade Pass for at least 9,600 years. Wild game was apparently utilized <b>by</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> and obsidian was exploited since at least 5,000 years before present. They used several routes that passed through the region, and may have used its natural resources during the summer. Some tribes personified the mountains and incorporated them into their religions. Many of these routes followed ridge tops {{in order to avoid}} the dense brush and avalanche chutes of the valley bottoms. Horses were also used in the eighteenth century. There was a trail used <b>by</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> as a route between Lake Chelan and the Suiattle River valley. The trail apparently traversed Cloudy Pass, which is some distance east of the lake. It was later used by miners and shepherds in the early 1900s. Shepherding was banned on Miners Ridge in 1940, but the popularity of the area continued to grow. Due to the area's popularity, the surrounding meadows deteriorated as a result of livestock grazing and off-trail hiking. As a result, livestock were allocated to the nearby Lady Camp Basin and hardier plants were introduced to the area surrounding the lake.|$|E

5|$|Between 1934 and 1963, {{the four}} wardens of Alcatraz resided here, {{including}} the first warden, James A. Johnston. A house of luxury, {{in stark contrast to}} the jail next to it, the wardens often held lavish cocktail parties here. The signpost at the spot shows a photograph of a trusted inmate doing chores at the house for the warden and that the house had a terraced garden and greenhouse. The mansion had tall windows, providing fine views of San Francisco Bay. Today, the house is a ruin, burned down <b>by</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> during the Occupation of Alcatraz on June 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|Not long afterwards, Horch {{closed the}} Roerich Museum, which {{subsequently}} {{moved to a}} new location at 319 West 107th Street in 1949. In the Roerich Museum's former space, Horch established the Riverside Museum. He became president of the new museum and appointed Vernon C. Porter as its director. Open to the public free of charge, the new museum was devoted mainly to exhibitions of contemporary art by American artists. At its opening in on June 4, 1938, the museum showed modern American paintings and work <b>by</b> <b>native</b> <b>Americans</b> as well as Tibetan art objects that Roerich had given to Horch. The American artists included Stuart Davis, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Jack Levine, Marsden Hartley, George Luks, John Sloan, Philip Evergood, Reginald Marsh, Charles Burchfield, and Rockwell Kent.|$|E
5|$|On August28, 1869, {{three men}} deserted the expedition, {{convinced}} {{that they could not}} possibly survive the trip through the Grand Canyon. They were killed <b>by</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> after making it to the rim of the canyon; two days later, the expedition ran the last of the Grand Canyon rapids and reached St. Thomas. Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including Glen Canyon, the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore. In what is perhaps a twist of irony, modern-day Lake Powell, which floods Glen Canyon, is also named for their leader.|$|E

5|$|Smith disbanded Ross's {{company in}} early September 1860. Within a week, Governor Sam Houston {{authorized}} Ross {{to raise his}} own company of 60 mounted volunteers to protect the settlements near Belknap from Native American attacks. Ross and his men arrived at Fort Belknap on October 17, 1860 to find the local citizens they were sworn to protect had passed a resolution asking Ross to resign his commission and leave the frontier. The citizens erroneously believed the raiding was committed <b>by</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> from the reservations, and they feared Ross's friendship with those on the reservations would make him ineffective.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota can {{generally}} {{be divided into}} three regions: eastern South Dakota, western South Dakota, and the Black Hills. The Missouri River serves as a boundary in terms of geographic, social, and political differences between eastern and western South Dakota. The geography of the Black Hills, long considered sacred <b>by</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> differs from its surroundings {{to such an extent}} it can be considered separate from the rest of western South Dakota. At times the Black Hills are combined with the rest of western South Dakota, and people often refer to the resulting two regions divided by the Missouri River as West River and East River.|$|E
5|$|The Buffalo Grove ambush was {{an ambush}} that {{occurred}} on May 19, 1832 {{as part of}} the Black Hawk War. A six-man detail carrying dispatches from United States Colonel James M. Strode at Galena, Illinois to General Henry Atkinson at Dixon's Ferry was ambushed <b>by</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> during the attack. William Durley was killed and buried near the site of the ambush. Durley's remains were initially interred by the party that would become victims of the St. Vrain massacre. Two other men had bullet holes in their clothing, but were uninjured. In 1910 the Polo Historical Society moved Durley's remains to a plot beneath a memorial they erected west of Polo, Illinois.|$|E
