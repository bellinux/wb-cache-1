5|$|The first Tetrarchs were {{delivered}} to the Army in November 1940, and were initially deployed with the 1st Armoured Division (which was being refitted after losing {{the majority of its}} previous tanks during the Battle of France) and the newly formed 6th Armoured Division. However, the faults discovered with the Tetrarch cooling system precluded them from <b>being</b> <b>integrated</b> into units that were sent to the Middle East to participate in the North African Campaign. Shortly after, all light tanks were discarded from the establishments of British armoured divisions as not suitable for further service.|$|E
5|$|The {{integration}} of the princely states {{raised the question of}} the future of the remaining colonial enclaves in India. At independence, the regions of Pondicherry, Karikal, Yanam, Mahe and Chandernagore were still colonies of France, and Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Goa remained colonies of Portugal. An agreement between France and India in 1948 provided for an election in France's remaining Indian possessions to choose their political future. A plebiscite held in Chandernagore on 19 June 1949 resulted in a vote of 7,463 to 114 in favour of <b>being</b> <b>integrated</b> with India. It was ceded to India on a de facto basis on 14 August 1949 and de jure on 2 May 1950. In the other enclaves, however, the pro-French camp, led by Edouard Goubert, used the administrative machinery to suppress the pro-merger groups. Popular discontent rose, and in 1954 demonstrations in Yanam and Mahe resulted in pro-merger groups assuming power. A referendum in Pondicherry and Karaikal in October 1954 resulted in a vote in favour of merger, and on 1 November 1954, de facto control over all four enclaves was transferred to the Republic of India. A treaty of cession was signed in May 1956, and following ratification by the French National Assembly in May 1962, de jure control of the enclaves was also transferred.|$|E
5|$|During the {{transition}} period between {{the signing of the}} Geneva Accords and the planned reunification elections, South Vietnam remained in chaos as the VNA tried to subdue the remaining autonomous factions of the Hòa Hảo, Cao Đài, and Bình Xuyên militias. In early 1955, during a battle with the Cao Đài forces of Trình Minh Thế, after a dispute over control of the That Son region, Ba Cụt was wounded in a disputed incident. Thế claimed to have tried initiating peace talks with Ba Cụt, but received no reply, so he decided to try to capture his rival. He sent some of his militant disciples to infiltrate Ba Cụt's forces and try to capture the Hòa Hảo leader. When they located Ba Cụt and surrounded him, he refused to surrender but instead tried to shoot his way out. Ba Cụt was severely wounded by a bullet that penetrated his chest. It seemed that he would die, but a French Air Force helicopter flew in and airlifted him to a colonial hospital. He recovered but in the interim the fighting stopped. Another account claims the two military leaders had been on good terms and exchanging diplomatic missions, but that the skirmish was caused by one of Ba Cụt's aides addressing the envoy in an abrasive and rude manner, and that the injuries were minor. Yet another account holds that the reaction by Thế's envoy was premeditated and that the claim the firing was in response to rudeness was merely a cover for an assassination attempt. According to this theory, Thế, whose units were then <b>being</b> <b>integrated</b> into Diệm's VNA, had given orders to target Ba Cụt. This was allegedly done on the orders of CIA agent Edward Lansdale, who was trying to help secure Diệm in power at the time. Lansdale has been accused of failing in an earlier attempt to bribe Ba Cụt to cease his activities.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: This thesis {{investigated}} how {{demographic variables}} affected the social well-being amongst ethnic minorities in Central Europe, building on acculturation and social capital theory. Method: The {{sample consisted of}} 543 respondents from six different countries in Central Europe, all stating that they belonged to an ethnic minority group. Data {{was provided by the}} European Social Survey, round 3. Social well-being was measured as two different outcomes; feeling of <b>being</b> socially <b>integrated</b> and civic engagement. Binary and logistic regression was used to assess the predictive power of the demographic variables on the outcome variables. Results: Five of the demographic variables were found to be significantly associated with the feeling of <b>being</b> socially <b>integrated.</b> The strongest predictor was age, indicating that higher age predicts higher levels of feeling of <b>being</b> socially <b>integrated.</b> For the civic engagement model, only parents born in country' and urbanization' were found to be significantly associated with civic engagement. Discussion: The different measures of social well-being; feeling of <b>being</b> socially <b>integrated</b> and civic engagement, were predicted by different variables. The feeling of <b>being</b> socially <b>integrated</b> model gives support to earlier empirical findings, where income, age, and language play an important role. The civic engagement model explained less variance than the feeling of <b>being</b> socially <b>integrated</b> model. This suggests that other variables are more important in the prediction of civic engagement than those included in this study...|$|R
