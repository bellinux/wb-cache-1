The search turned up a hoard of false documents, including some proclaiming Plantard the true king of France. Plantard admitted under oath that he had fabricated everything, including Pelat's involvement with the Priory of Sion. Plantard was threatened with legal action by the Pelat family and therefore disappeared to his house in southern France. He was 74 years old at the time. Nothing more was heard of him until he died in Paris on 3 February 2000.|$|E

40|$|More than 400 banks failed {{during the}} recent {{financial}} crisis. <b>Bank</b> <b>failures</b> {{have a significant impact}} on the financial system and the economy as a whole. It is important to identify factors that may contribute to <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> so that <b>banks</b> can take measures to reduce their default risk. This paper examines how bank specific characteristics and economic conditions affect <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> {{during the recent}} financial crisis. We employ the logistic regression model to study this issue using the U. S. commercial bank data over the sample period 2007 - 2012. We find that the ratio of the loan and leases to total assets, real estate loan ratio, and non-performing loan ratio have a positive influence on the <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> while capital adequacy ratios, return on assets, liquid ratio, and GDP growth rate have a negative impact on <b>bank</b> <b>failures...</b>|$|R

By September 15, 2008, the 158-year-old Lehman Brothers holding company filed for bankruptcy with intent to liquidate its assets, leaving its financially sound subsidiaries operational and outside of the bankruptcy filing.

25|$|A {{principal}} {{issue in}} the referendum was the economy. The UK Treasury issued a report on 20 May 2013 which said that Scotland's banking systems would be too big to ensure depositor compensation {{in the event of}} a <b>bank</b> <b>failure.</b> The report indicated that Scottish banks would have assets worth 1,254% of GDP, which is more than Cyprus and Iceland before the last global financial crisis. It suggested Scottish taxpayers would each have £65,000 of potential liabilities during a hypothetical bailout in Scotland, versus £30,000 as part of the UK. Economists including Andrew Hughes Hallett, Professor of Economics at St Andrews University, rejected the idea that Scotland would have to underwrite these liabilities alone. He observed that banks operating in more than one country can be given a joint bailout by multiple governments. In this manner, Fortis Bank and the Dexia Bank were bailed out collectively by France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The Federal Reserve System lent more than $1 trillion to British banks, including $446 billion to the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), because they had operations in the United States.|$|E
40|$|Using count data on {{the number}} of <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> in US states during the 1960 to 2006 period, this paper endeavors to {{establish}} how far sources of economic risk (recessions, high interest rates, in ation) or differences in solvency and branching regulation can explain some of the fragility in banking. Assuming that variables are predetermined, lagged values provide instruments to absorb potential endogeneity between the number of <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> and economic and regulatory conditions. Results suggest that <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> are not merely self-fulfilling prophecies but relate systematically to inflation as well as to policy changes in banking regulation. Furthermore, in terms of statistical and economic significance, the distribution and development of bankruptcies across US states depends crucially on past <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> suggesting that contagion provides an important channel through which banking crises emerge. ...|$|R

25|$|The Triple A's chief nemesis at the time, the far-left {{terrorist}} group Montoneros, claimed up to 1,000 lives from 1970 until their elimination in 1976. They also perpetrated {{a number of}} high-profile ransom kidnappings, notably that of Jorge and Juan Born in September 1974. The Born brothers, directors of what was then one of Argentina's largest conglomerates (Bunge y Born) paid US$60 million for their release in June 1975, a world record at the time. At least US$14 million of these proceeds were laundered by David Graiver, a real-estate developer. Graiver fled Argentina in 1975 and settled in Manhattan, from where he bought controlling stake {{in a variety of}} banks in the U.S. and elsewhere. He reportedly {{died in a plane crash}} near Acapulco in August 1976, however, leaving US$45 million in bad debts that resulted in the collapse of American Bank & Trust – at the time the 4th largest <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> in U.S. history. District Attorney Robert Morgenthau was skeptical that Graiver died in the crash, and indicted Graiver for the failure of American Bank & Trust; Graiver's banks in Argentina and elsewhere also failed.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the role of commercial real estate investments in the banking crisis of 1985 - 92, an unprecedented period during which more than 1, 300 <b>banks</b> failed. <b>Bank</b> <b>failures</b> are fundamentally important because of the unique role played by financial institutions {{in the provision of}} business credit. We discover three striking features of banks failing during this period. First, commercial real estate was only a factor in the <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> of 1988 - 92. Second, construction loans played a much larger role in <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> than permanent loans, and the relationship is strongest with construction loans booked during 1983 - 1985. Third, other ex ante risk measures are systematically related to <b>banking</b> <b>failure</b> throughout the sample period. These results suggest that risk-seeking banks brought about their own demise and commercial real estate, especially construction lending, was one of the vehicles. ...|$|R

500|$|On 6 June 2012, the European Commission {{adopted a}} {{legislative}} {{proposal for a}} harmonised bank recovery and resolution mechanism.

The proposal is part of a new scheme in which banks will be compelled to [...] "bail-in" [...] their creditors whenever they fail, the basic aim being to prevent taxpayer-funded bailouts in the future.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a model that studies the impact of a {{tightening}} monetary policy on <b>banking</b> <b>failure</b> in a developing country. Design/methodology/approach – The interest rate on treasury bills is included in the model to measure monetary policy. Since the model considers developing countries with low-income level, the paper assumes that a secondary market does not exist. Findings – The model shows that, despite treasury bills constituting an alternative source of profit for banks in developing countries, a tightening monetary policy increases the probability of <b>banking</b> <b>failure.</b> In addition, the model shows that efficiency level explains the asymmetric effect of monetary policy on the profit of the banks. Practical implications – The policy implication of the results of the paper is that the central bank should take into account the adverse effect of a tightening monetary policy on <b>banking</b> <b>failure,</b> when planning policy decisions. Originality/value – The paper offers insights into the linkage between monetary policy and <b>banking</b> <b>failure</b> in developing countries. <b>Banking,</b> Business <b>failures,</b> Developing countries, Interest rates, Monetary policy...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the impact of}} changes in the urban labor force and foreign direct {{investment}} on the banking sector, using a dynamic general equilibrium model with a financial sector. Numerical simulations are performed using stylized Chinese data, and <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> are generated through increases in the growth rate of the labor force, a revaluation of the exchange rate, or an increase in debt issue to finance the government deficit, as compared to a benchmark scenario in which banks remain solvent. Thus <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> can result from what might seem to be either beneficial economic trends or correct monetary and fiscal policies. We introduce fiscal policies that modify relative factor prices by lowering the capital tax rate and increasing the tax rate on labor.

The reason it was created is that banks were not lending funds to one another and banks in need of funds were refusing to go to the discount window. Banks were not lending money to each other because there was a fear that the loans would not be paid back.
