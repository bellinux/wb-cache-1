40|$|In August {{this year}} Professor Mark Chase from the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, west of London, flew into Perth in Western Australia, hired a 4 WD vehicle and drove north. After {{clocking}} up 9, 000 km {{he told me}} he had collected seed from thousands of plants of nine species and subspecies belonging to one genus. This genetic resource is now catalogued and stored in England. He had done the same in South Australia in 2014 and plans to repeat the exercise in WA in 2016. Let’s be clear upfront. Chase is no <b>bio-pirate,</b> he’s a respected professor and everything he did was perfectly legal and above board. So what’s the problem...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the encounter between Tibetan medicine and biomedicine, {{and the way}} biomedical power is locally domesticated. It is about <b>bio-pirates,</b> imaginary pharmaceutical industries and the (at times virtual) theft of medical knowledge in India. In this country, a series of measures bearing on the utilization, protection and preservation of phytogenetic resources and related knowledge have been established, such as intellectual property rights. This national movement has repercussions throughout the land, including Ladakh, a region of the north-west Himalayas. However, although the local protagonists agree to follow the national policy, they redefine its meaning and purposes to serve their interests on the levels of their community and of national society. This chapter is concerned with questions of social, ethnic and medical identities, which are expressed through ‘hijacking' a relatively new subject {{in the field of}} medicine in Ladakh: intellectual property rights. The amchi hold off the force of external and dominant powers – medicine, state, religion – over their own world. They endeavour in these contexts to consolidate their community and/or individual power, to affirm their ethnicity and their medical identity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Protecting {{the right}} of the local community/country to use their own genetic {{resources}} available in a particular area is an important element of environmental and biodiversity conservation. However, one of the biggest biodiversity conservation challenges faced by southern peripheral countries is biopiracy and related issues. Community based ecotourism (CBET) is a well-established concept and its implementation is an important component in many regional development strategies. This research argues that though CBET which originated as a western concept has been successfully applied in number of projects, it generates biopiracy challenges in its implementation when CBET operates within different geo-political, economic and cultural contexts. This research examines such challenges to CBET initiatives in the Sinharaja world heritage site, Sri Lanka. A qualitative-inductive research methodology has principally guided this research to examine the socio-cultural and socio-economic context of biopiracy issues. A total of 293 participants have informed this research including 193 interviews. A critical discourse analysis (CDA) method is used to examine both primary qualitative data collected through participant and direct observation, interviews and secondary data. One of the main findings is that despite plans being developed at a community level, in wider context, challenges of biopiracy related to superimposed capitalism contest CBET ideologies. Superimposed capitalism results in individualistic and competitive behaviours that undermine collaborative and responsible community approach. Presently, smuggling out of Wallapatta plant (Gyrinops walla) and gathering of Spotted bowfinger gecko (Cyrtodactylus triedra) which is an endemic nocturnal reptile species have become profitable in KudawaSinharaja site {{and a growing number of}} biopirates venture into here. Local community of this site takes risks in forest genetic resources smuggling because it provides them with the means of earning much money within a short period. Regardless of all prevalent laws and regulations against bioprospecting, biopiracy, biological resource and wildlife smuggling, authorities have still failed to control these activities in this site because of the support given to <b>bio-pirates</b> by the local community. The research concludes that CBET is an appropriate pathway for tourism development in Sri Lanka but recognition of biopiracy issues associated with superimposed capitalism is required and needed to be addressed. A well-defined monitoring system and an effective legal framework to control adverse effects are important for achieving CBET goals while confronting biopiracy.
