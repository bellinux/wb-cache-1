40|$|Nest {{predation}} is {{the primary}} factor influencing grassland songbird reproductive success. Understanding factors driving spatial and temporal variation in nest survival requires that we identify the primary nest predators and factors influencing predator abundance and behavior. Predation events are rarely witnessed, and the identification of nest predators is inferred, often incorrectly, from nest remains or observations of potential predators. We used video photography to identify predators of Sprague 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Pipit</b> (Anthus spragueii) nests in Saskatchewan and Montana. We monitored 60 nests in Saskatchewan and 11 nests in Montana and documented at least ten different species preying upon eggs and nestlings. Northern Harrier (Circus cyaneus) and thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) were the most common nest predators documented on videotape, along with mouse (Peromyscus spp.), vole (Microtus spp.), deer (Odocoileus spp.), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), coyote (Canis latrans), Black-billed Magpie (Pica hudsonia), Western Meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), and gartersnake (Thamnophis spp.). Most predation events occurred during the nestling stage and primarily during the day, potentially due to the increased activity of adults feeding young and of the nestlings begging for food. The diverse predator communities documented destroying grassland songbird nests presents many challenges for land managers attempting to increase reproductive success of Sprague 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Pipits</b> and other priority grassland birds...|$|R

40|$|There are no published, {{long-term}} {{accounts of}} responses of grassland passerine birds to {{the restoration of}} northern mixed-grass prairie through combined use of fire and grazing. During 1979 - 2001, we assessed abundance of passerine birds (9 grassland species and 1 shrub-associate species) on 2 brush-invaded, mixed-grass prairie tracts at Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge in northwestern North Dakota. Each tract encompassed 90 ha (220 ac) that were being restored through 4 prescribed fires then 3 consecutive years of grazing by cattle. Fires were separated by 2 - 4 years of rest (i. e., nondisturbance) and grazing was initiated 2 years after the last fire. Among 3 initially common species of passerines, abundance of Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) changed little {{from the beginning to}} end of the burn-graze sequence, but numbers of common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) and clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida) declined. Six species of passerines, including the endemic Sprague 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>pipit</b> (Anthus spragueii) and Baird 2 ̆ 7 s sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii), were absent or rare before restoration began but increased after burning occurred. Increases in abundance were most evident during rest years after the third and fourth burns, particularly for grasshopper sparrow (A. savannarum) and Baird 2 ̆ 7 s sparrow. Almost no increases occurred after the first burn. Changed abundances coincided with a shift from shrub-dominated to grass-dominated vegetation along with a decrease in vegetation structure; grass cover increased from 45...|$|R

40|$|In January of 1986 my brother, Ed M.

Our efforts had yielded such birds as Bean Goose, Green-tailed Towhee, Black-necked Stilt, Red Phalarope, Lewis 2 ̆ 7 Woodpecker, Sprague 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Pipit,</b> Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Finch, Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Kingbird, and King Eider. When 1985 ended, my Nebraska life list stood at 290 and I had seen 237 species in the state for the year, without any real attempt to see migrant songbirds.... In summary, I found all of the 197 birds I had given a Code 1, and 53 of the 54 Code 2 species (missed Hermit Thrush). Of the 40 birds I had given a Code 3 I had found 26. Included in my total were 12 Code 4 birds and 3 Code 5 species. Each species counted in the total had at least one witness or was documented with a photograph.... All in all, 1986 was a great year for birding and I had a fun time playing the game. One always thinks about the species he missed, but I know I 2 ̆ 7 ll remember for life some that I found. It was a year I learned {{a great deal about the}} birds of Nebraska, and about Nebraska as a whole. Perhaps the best part of birding in 1986 was making new acquaintances, spending time with old friends, and just sharing the joys and experiences that go with the sport...|$|R

40|$|Of {{the genus}} Scincella Mittleman, 1950 (sensu Greer, 1974) 337 {{specimens}} from Asia were examined for 74 characters, which were {{treated in a}} numerical-taxonomic way. The dendrogram resulting from this analysis was not stringently adhered to. Because of the wide variation in certain numerical scale characters within one taxon or even within one population, these characters (used by many authors as key characters to separate taxa) are not regarded as very important. For sympatric and parapatric species other characters, including relative size of head, body and limbs, are regarded as very important, because these characters {{are influenced by the}} way of life (niche separation). For the separation of allopatric species scale-numbers, but many other characters as well, were used.
