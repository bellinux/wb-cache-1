5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the restoration, the spare A3 <b>boiler</b> had been dispatched in June 2005 to Riley & Son to be completely rebuilt. It was to be used instead of the A4 <b>boiler</b> both out of the desire to restore the locomotive to original condition, {{and because it was}} deemed that the A4 <b>boiler</b> had deteriorated into a worse state than the spare due to the higher operating pressures the locomotive had experienced following the up-rating of the locomotive to 250psi during its last private overhaul. Deemed surplus to requirements, the A4 <b>boiler</b> was sold to Jeremy Hosking for potential use on his locomotive, LNER Class A4 4464 Bittern.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1876, Thunderer {{suffered}} a disastrous <b>boiler</b> explosion which killed 45 people. One of her boilers burst as she proceeded from Portsmouth Harbour to Stokes Bay {{to carry out}} a full-power trial. The explosion killed 15 people instantly, including her commanding officer; around 70 others were injured, of whom 30 later died. This was the Royal Navy's most deadly <b>boiler</b> explosion through the whole century. A model representing the failed <b>boiler</b> was made and is now in the Science Museum. The explosion was caused because a pressure gauge was broken and the safety valve had corroded in place. When the steam stop valve to the engines was closed, pressure in the <b>boiler</b> rose and could not be released. The four box boilers were the last in service in the Navy and operated at what would even then would have been considered a relatively low pressure, for more modern boilers, of 30 psi. The <b>boiler</b> was repaired and the ship was completed on 26 May 1877 at a cost of £368,428.|$|E

500|$|The {{propulsion}} system of all five ships {{consisted of three}} vertical 4-cylinder [...] triple expansion engines built by AG Vulcan. Steam was provided by twelve coal-fired <b>boilers</b> from different manufacturers, {{with the exception of}} Hansa. Victoria Louise and Vineta had <b>boilers</b> from Dürr AG, Freya had Niclausse <b>boilers,</b> and Hertha had Belleville <b>boilers.</b> Hansa was equipped with eighteen transverse Belleville <b>boilers.</b> The Niclausse <b>boilers</b> in Freya proved to be particularly troublesome, which led the Navy to use only Schulz-Thornycroft or Marine-type <b>boilers</b> in future vessels.

5|$|The Bucknill Committee, {{which had}} been set up to {{investigate}} the loss of major warships, also produced a report. This report said that the lack of backup power sources was a major design failure, which contributed to the loss: Ark Royal depended on electricity for much of her operation, and once the boilers and steam-driven dynamos were knocked out, the loss of power made damage control difficult. The committee recommended the design of the bulkheads and <b>boiler</b> intakes be improved to decrease the risk of widespread flooding in <b>boiler</b> rooms and machine spaces, while the uninterrupted <b>boiler</b> room flat was criticised. The design flaws were rectified in the Illustrious- and Implacable-class carriers, under construction at the time.|$|E

5|$|According to Admiral Kummetz' report, {{the first}} torpedo hit Kesselraum 2 (boileroom 2, {{just under the}} funnel) and the second hit Turbinenraum 2/3 (the turbine room for the side shafts). <b>Boiler</b> 1 had already been {{destroyed}} by gunfire.

By 04:34, the ship had been severely damaged, but had successfully passed through the firing zone; the Norwegian guns could no longer bear on her. The 15cm guns in the Kopås battery were all standing in open positions with a wide sector of firing. After the torpedo hits, Blücher was still within range. The battery asked for orders, but Eriksen concluded: The fortress has served its purpose. With all propellers stopped, about 60% of the electric power gone, Blucher quickly lost speed and at about 04:50 dropped anchors at Askoholmene.|$|E

5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{building}} reactors in 1943. A group was created in Bacher's P Division, the P-7 (Water <b>Boiler)</b> Group, {{under the leadership of}} Donald Kerst, that included Charles P. Baker, Gerhart Friedlander, Lindsay Helmholtz, Marshall Holloway and Raemer Schreiber. Robert F. Christy from the T-1 Group provided support with the theoretical calculations, in particular, a calculation of the critical mass. He calculated that 600 grams of uranium-235 would form a critical mass in a tamper of infinite size. Initially it was planned to operate the Water <b>Boiler</b> at 10kW, but Fermi and Samuel K. Allison visited in September 1943, and went over the proposed design. They pointed out the danger of decomposition of the uranium salt, and recommended heavier shielding. It was also noted that radioactive fission products would be created {{that would have to be}} chemically removed. As a consequence, it was decided that the Water <b>Boiler</b> would only run at 1kW until more operating experience had been accumulated, and features needed for high power operation were shelved for the time being.|$|E
5|$|Maintenance problems. The chain driven {{valve gear}} {{proved to be}} {{expensive}} to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused oil to splash onto the <b>boiler</b> lagging in service. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash which provided a combustible material, {{and as a result}} of the heavy braking of the locomotives, sparks would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto the wheels when stationary to be flung upwards into the <b>boiler</b> lagging in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would invariably be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming into contact with the hot <b>boiler,</b> causing stress to the casing. Many photographs show an unmodified with 'buckled' (warped) casing, the result of a lagging fire.|$|E

The need to save weight meant that compromises were made in {{some aspects of the}} design. The <b>boiler</b> size was constrained by the SECR’s axle-loading restrictions, with the result that the design’s full steaming potential was not realised.

5|$|The Water <b>Boiler</b> was an aqueous {{homogeneous}} reactor, a type {{of nuclear}} reactor in which the nuclear fuel {{in the form of}} soluble uranium sulfate is dissolved in water. Uranium sulfate was chosen instead of uranium nitrate because sulfur's neutron capture cross section is less than that of nitrogen. The project was proposed by Bacher in April 1943 as part of an ongoing program of measuring critical masses in chain-reacting systems. He saw it also as a means of testing various materials in critical mass systems. T Division were opposed to the project, which was seen as a distraction from studies related to the form of chain reactions found in an atomic bomb, but Bacher prevailed on this point. Calculations related to the Water <b>Boiler</b> did take up an inordinate amount of T Division's time in 1943. The reactor theory developed by Fermi did not apply to the Water <b>Boiler.</b>|$|E
