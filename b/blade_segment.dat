Rotation of the spools causes the cables to be wound onto or off their respective spool consequently effecting retraction/extension of the pulley and the attached outboard rotor blade section relative the inboard rotor blade section.

40|$|Abstract. An {{investigation}} is reported {{of the dressing}} of metal-bonded diamond saw blades with four different dressing methods – stirring the <b>blade</b> <b>segments</b> in rock slurries, surface grinding the <b>blade</b> <b>segments</b> with Al 2 O 3 wheels, dressing the <b>blade</b> <b>segments</b> with SiC wheels, and dressing the blades through sawing of refractory materials. The surfaces of dressed <b>blade</b> <b>segments</b> were examined by a scanning electron microscope. The protrusion of the diamond grits on the dressed segments was quantitatively assessed using a digital optical microscope. The vertical and horizontal force components and the spindle power were measured in the refractory sawing. The grit protrusion generated by the stirring method {{was found to be}} the highest and most diamond grits remained their original crystal shapes. But it took a quite long period to let the diamond grits protrude from the bond matrix. The protrusion produced by the surface grinding ranked the lowest among the four methods. The height of grit protrusion for either SiC dressing or refractory sawing was found to be about 20 % of the diamond average size, which might be an optimal point with respect to the segment sawing performance. Force analysis indicated that the force per diamond grit in refractory sawing was much lower than the diamond compressive strength. The changes of spindle power in the sawing of refractory materials can be used to in-process monitor the dressing process...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} {{aspects of}} the agricultural activities and network supported by ‘Canaanean' <b>blade</b> <b>segments</b> from Ninevite V sites located principally in Syria and Iraq. Technological and functional analyses of an extensive sample of these tools, alongside experimental and ethnoarchaeological reference data, points to their use as instruments for working cereals, but not a harvesting tool (sickle) as is usually assumed. Our analyses indicate that these blades were standardised inserts used in a special raft-like threshing sledge as described in contemporary cuneiform texts. The functional study was enlarged to include an extensive experimental program that studied harvesting and other manual tools. In particular, we analysed all effects of the functioning of reconstructed threshing rafts, armed with reproductions of Canaanean <b>blade</b> <b>segments.</b> Microscopic silica phytolith ‘sheets', extracted from soil samples taken from structures in various sites, indicated that straw chopped with the instrument was used in large quantities as mudbrick temper, fuel and animal fodder. Experimental studies carried out on blades to examine indicators of the knapping method revealed traces of a special manufacturing technique—pressure debitage with a lever and a copper-tipped point, which was identified on standardised Canaanean blades in the northern Mesopotamian sites studied. Our findings suggest that these Canaanean <b>blade</b> <b>segments</b> were produced in northern Mesopotamian workshops and then distributed over the region to equip threshing sledges.

The two primary components of this noise are Blade-Wake Interaction (BWI) noise, {{due to the}} blades' interaction with the turbulent wakes of the preceding blades, and "Self" noise, due to the development and shedding of turbulence within the blades' boundary layers. Emphasized in this report is the new code development for Self noise. The analysis and validation employs data from the HART program, a model BO- 105 rotor wind tunnel test conducted in the German-Dutch Wind Tunnel (DNW).

40|$|The {{greening}} of etiolated first leaf {{blades of}} wheat (Triticium aestivum Mercia) seedlings (referred {{to in the}} text as leaf tissue) was studied in relation to tissue age and water stress. Use was made of whole seedlings, excised leaf blades and leaf <b>blade</b> <b>segments.</b> Responses to photoperiodic illumination were measured as changes in the levels of chlorophyll, total soluble protein and nucleic acids (both total and specific fractions). The pattern of greening in the whole seedlings, excised leaf blades and leaf <b>blade</b> <b>segments</b> was essentially the same in 6 and 10 day-old dark-grown tissues, where chlorophyll accumulation followed the age sequence along the leaf. Least chlorophyll accumulated in the tip of leaves of both ages but the older leaves contained less overall pigment than the younger leaves. Patterns of total soluble protein and total nucleic acid accumulation did not reflect the pattern shown by the chlorophyll. Protein accumulated most in the tip region, with nucleic acids being highest in the middle region. Water stress treatment reduced chlorophyll accumulation in leaf blade tissue, particularly in the intact seedlings. Protein levels, however, were more variable and appeared to reflect {{the ability of the}} younger tissue to accumulate this compound as a stress metabolite. Total nucleic acid levels were also elevated under water stress. Again, these effects were most marked on the intact seedlings, implying that an effect on the roots was also involved. The data from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of RNA fractions showed that the level of chloroplast RNA components was maintained up to 17 days for tissue incubated in the dark {{as well as in the}} light. Severe water stress treatments applied to the roots of whole seedlings resulted in the loss of ribosomal fraction in the leaves. However, this effect was not seen with mild water stress. Kinetin treatments during water stress did not appear to alter the pattern of cell component accumulation although in unstressed material, treatment with this compound enhanced chlorophyll accumulation slightly, especially in the young tissue. This indicates that, at the concentration used, the growth regulator was not able to alleviate the stress condition. The leaf blades of intact seedlings responded in a specific way which was much more pronounced than for excised leaf blades or leaf <b>blade</b> <b>segments.</b> It was concluded that some signalling was involved between the root and shoot tissues during water stress treatments...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} computer simulations of the stress/strain field {{built up in}} a cobalt matrix diamond impregnated saw <b>blade</b> <b>segment</b> during its fabrication and after loading the protruding diamond with an external force. The main objective of this work was to create {{better understanding of the}} factors affecting retention of diamond particles in a metallic matrix of saw blade segments, which are produced by means of the powder metallurgy technology. The effective use of diamond impregnated tools strongly depends on mechanical and tribological properties of the matrix, which has to hold the diamond grits firmly. The diamond retention capability of the matrix is affected in a complex manner by chemical or mechanical interactions between the diamond crystal and the matrix during the segment manufacture. Due to the difference between the thermal expansion coefficients of the diamond and metallic matrix, a complex stress/strain field is generated in the matrix surrounding each diamond crystal. It is assumed that the matrix potential for diamond retention can be associated with the amount of the elastic and plastic deformation energy {{and the size of the}} deformation zone occurring in the matrix around diamonds. The stress and strain fields generated in the matrix were calculated using the Abaqus software.

40|$|Wind {{turbine rotor}} blades are {{designed}} and certified {{according to the}} current IEC and DNV GL standards, which include the final full-scale experiment. The experiment is used to validate the assumptions made in the design models. The drawbacks of traditional full-scale testing are elaborated, i. e. the replication of realistic loading and structural response plus its observation during testing. Sub-component testing is proposed as potential method to sufficiently solve the drawbacks. Compared to the actual loading that a rotor blade is subjected to in the field, however, the full-scale test loading underlies the following simplifications and constrains: (1) The full-scale fatigue test is conducted as dynamic test, where the load time series obtained from aero- servo-elastic simulations are simplified to a damage equivalent load range. (2) The load directions are typically applied solely in two directions, often pure lead-lag and flap-wise directions which {{are not necessarily the}} most critical load directions for a particular <b>blade</b> <b>segment.</b> (3) Parts of the blade are overloaded by up to 20 % to achieve the target load along the whole span. Another downside of the full-scale testing method is that dynamic testing at natural frequencies between 0. 4 and 1. 0 Hz results in long test times. Testing takes usually several months. Sub-component testing may replicate real design loading conditions more accurately than full-scale blade testing, while allowing more flexible loading conditions. Furthermore, different span-wise blade segments can be tested with different load directions, representing the critical load for that particular segment. Since fatigue sub-component testing is conducted as actuator driven the testing frequency is not constrained to the specimen’s natural frequency. This allows faster testing compared to the full-scale test. In this work the comparison of both testing methods is exemplary elaborated on a trailing edge bond line design...|$|E
40|$|Active Twist Rotor Blades {{have been}} {{developed}} for the use in secondary control such as higher harmonic control (HHC) and individual blade control (IBC). The basic principle of such blades is the implementation of piezoelectric actuators into the blades, using different types of coupling, causing the blades to twist. At the DLR model scale blades have been manufactured to demonstrate the feasibility of such systems. This paper is describing two other types of application of such blades. De-icing a rotor blade using the pre-existing actuators. The working principle for de-icing the blade is to excite vibrations with high amplitudes. These vibrations break up and shake off the ice. The centrifugal forces clear the ice off the rotor blade; however, the stiffening effect caused by the rota-tion reduces the amplitude of the bending modes, which are the most influential factor in breaking up the ice. First tests have been made using a 50 cm long <b>blade</b> <b>segment.</b> A setup was established to grow different types of ice on the blade within a freezer between - 10 ° C and - 25 ° C in a non-rotating system. It could be shown that glaze ice could be broken easily. Next steps will be the test of the effectiveness to remove ice in a rotating system, where more realistic ice formations will be generated. Also it has to be examined how good the system works for rime ice. Manipulation of damping using blade integrated actuators. The idea is to use blade integrated ac-tuators as part of electromechanical absorbers. Using certain electrical networks, the structural behavior of the rotor blade can be significantly influenced. The effectiveness of such systems to increase the structural damping of an active twist blade was experimentally investigated. The op-eration of different sets of actuators allowed the excitation of individual modes. At first an oscillating circuit was established coupling the capacitive piezoelectric actuators with an inductivity. If the setup is tuned right, this results in a significant decrease of the amplitudes of a single frequency, e. g. torsional eigenfrequencies. In a next step a virtual "negative capacity" was used to dissipate the vibrating energy in the electrical circuit. Such an element shows the same amplitude response as the capacity, but the phase is shifted by 180 ° compared to a "regular capac-ity". The advantage of this method is the effectiveness over a broad frequency range. That way several modes can be influenced at the same time. Finally, a first evaluation of the influence of these measures on the vibration level of a complete rotor was carried out...|$|E

40|$|Individual- and Local Blade Control (IBC/LBC) for {{helicopter}} rotors {{promises to}} be a method to increase flight performance and to reduce vibration and noise. Quite a few concepts to realize IBC Systems have been proposed so far. Some of them have already been tested in wind tunnels or on real helicopters. A drawback of all systems that include discrete mechanical components like hinges, levers or gears is their vulnerability in a helicopter environment with high centrifugal loads and high vibration levels. That’s why the idea of using smart materials that are directly embedded in the rotor blade structure is very attractive for this application. Operating as solid state actuators they can generate a twist deformation of the rotor blade without any friction and wear. A promising approach is the use of anisotropic piezoelectric strain actuators embedded in the rotor blade skin. This concept has been intensively investigated in the US. Wind tunnel tests have been performed with 1 / 6 th scaled CH- 47 rotor with a radius of 1. 397 m and a chord of 108 mm in a heavy gas me-dium. Investigations on up-scaling have been carried out using a full scale <b>blade</b> <b>segment</b> of a CH- 47 blade. Main features of these blades are a D-spar configuration and several plies of Active Fiber Composites (AFC). Motivated by these promising results and the potential benefits, the goal of this work was the development and test of an active twist blade incorporating improved actuation tech-nology and alternative structural concepts to bring this technology a further step forward. At this phase the test are limited to a verification of the actuation system and the structural concepts under centrifugal loads. The intention is to develop the necessary prerequisites for a successful wind tunnel campaign with an active twist model rotor. Because of the large amount of available experi-mental data, the BO 105 model rotor was chosen as reference rotor, having a radius of 2 m and a chord of 121 mm. The baseline design of all blades was a C-spar configuration with an anisotropic blade skin incorporating a single layer of state of the art Macro Fiber Composite (MFC) actuators. The design of the blades was optimized using a finite element code as well as rotor dynamic simu-lations to predict the benefits with respect to vibrations, noise and performance. Several blades with different skin lay-ups, actuator configurations and spar geometry were designed build and tested. The blades were intensively investigated within some bench- and centrifugal tests. To mea-sure the blade deformation the blades were equipped with several sets of strain gauges. An optical measurement system was installed to allow a direct measurement of the active twist angle. The centrifugal test comprised a measurement of the active twist performance at the nominal rotation speed of 1043 RPM at different excitation frequencies from 2 /rev up to 6 /rev. Finally the blades were compared with respect to their twist performance...|$|E

A striking correlation was found in each genotype between both the location and timing of increase in apoplastic peroxidase activity and the onset of growth deceleration. Only cationic isoforms of apoplastic peroxidase could be identified in the elongation zone, whereas additional anionic isoforms appeared in the region of secondary cell wall deposition.

SCG from newborn rats (l- 2 d postnatal) were excised initially into enriched Ll 5 (Gibco) plating medium (prepared {{as described by}} Hawrot and Patterson, 1979) without addedglucose. Ganglia were desheathed and transferred to final plating medium containing 50 rllml 30 % glucose (0. 75 % final concentration). Ganglia could be stored in this medium at 4 °C {{for up to a}} week without apparent loss of the potential to regenerate neurites, but ganglia were normally used immediately or within 12 hr after excision. Preparation of explant cultures was similar to the method of Estridge and Bunge (1978). Ganglia were removed one by one onto the inside of a 3 cm plastic petri dish cover and cut into 6 - 8 pieces of 200 - 400 pm diameter using a sterile 23 surgical <b>blade.</b> <b>Segments</b> from 10 - 20 ganglia were pooled and 5 - 6 pieces were placed in 3 cm petri dishes precoated with collagen containing 0. 5 ml preheated growth medium (see below), leaving- 1 cm between any 2 explants. The small amount of medium ensured that explants remain as placed until attachment, which wa...|$|R
40|$|An {{acoustics}} {{test of a}} 2 / 5 {{scale model}} BO- 105 helicopter main rotor was conducted in the Duits-Nederlandse Windtunnel (DNW). A range of operating conditions was tested from hover to moderately high flight speeds for various climb and descent rates at different thrust settings. Diagnostic tests including rotor speed and blade geometry changes were made to better isolate and study particular broadband self noise sources. Acoustic data {{in the form of}} acoustic pressure time histories and power spectra are used to demonstrate the regions of importance of the different broadband noise sources and their sensitivity to operating conditions. To help interpret the data, comparisons are made to predictions of rotor broadband noise. The predictions are based on self noise data previously obtained from isolated airfoil sections {{and the use of the}} NASA ROTONET program to define rotor performance and to sum contributions of noise from individual <b>blade</b> <b>segments.</b> An important result herein is the identification and articulation of a previously unheralded rotor broadband noise source. This source is blade-turbulent wake interaction (BWI) noise which dominates the spectra in the mid-frequencies for off-peak blade-vortex interaction (BVI) noise flight conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{very rapid}} growth in wind energy {{technology}} in the last 15 years {{has led to a}} {{rapid growth in}} the amount of non-biodegradable, thermosetting fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials used in wind turbine blades. This paper discusses conceptual architectural and structural options for recycling these blades by reusing parts of wind turbine blades in new or retrofitted housing projects. It focuses on large-sized FRP pieces that can be salvaged from the turbine blades and can potentially be useful in infrastructure projects where harsh environmental conditions (water and high humidity) exist. Since reuse design should be for specific regional locations and architectural characteristics the designs presented in this paper are for the coastal regions of the Yucatan province in Mexico on the Gulf of Mexico where low-quality masonry block informal housing is vulnerable to severe hurricanes and flooding. To demonstrate the concept a prototype 100 m long wind blade model developed by Sandia National Laboratories is used to show how a wind blade can be broken down into parts, thus making it possible to envision architectural applications for the different wind <b>blade</b> <b>segments</b> for housing applications...|$|R
