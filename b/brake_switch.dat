50|$|This was a later {{model of}} the 125 that debuted for 1982 and {{included}} a torque converter clutch or TCC. The TCC acts similar to a clutch in a manual transmission vehicle, in that at speeds above 50 MPH a combination of engine vacuum- and temperature-sensing valves, and a dedicated <b>brake</b> <b>switch</b> - and in later models an ECU - activated a solenoid which engaged a clutch physically locking the impeller and turbine inside the torque converter together causing engine power to be transferred directly to the transaxle. The C in Turbo-Hydramatic 125 C denoted {{the use of a}} TCC. The solenoid that controls this is notorious for failure due to overheated plastic componentry, and problems indicated by an engine stall when stopping from speeds greater than 55 MPH. This occurs because the clutch does not disengage, and as the affected vehicle's speed nears zero miles per hour, the engine is forced to decelerate to zero rpm.|$|E

40|$|This report {{represents}} the bachelor thesis examination by Julia Kastehelmi Rintamäki. The examination has been performed during spring semester 2013 at Volvo Construction Equipment in Eskilstuna. This report, Development of parking brake component, describes the {{product development process}} of the parking brake component for articulated hauler, wheel loader and grader. Volvo CE has problems with the parking <b>brake</b> <b>switch</b> that exist today on articulated hauler, wheel loader and grader. The purpose of this project is to develop one common solution for the parking brake component for articulated hauler, wheel loader and grader. The secondary purpose is to find final concept proposal for each machine. Employees at the Volvo CE were interviewed; they were contacted via e-mail, phone calls and via meetings {{to get the information}} about the machines and the information around the parking brake component. Volvo CE databases were also used for gathering information about standards and pictures. Lots of different ideas were sketched and concept proposals were created with the aid of material from marketing analysis, competitor analysis, target group analysis, requirement specification, function analysis, standards and ergonomics. Eight concept proposals were chosen to be evaluated with QFD, Pugh’s matrix and FMEA. Two concepts were most suitable and developed further to three dimensional models with the aid of Solid Works. The different aspects were taken into account when designing and dimensioning the final concepts. Two models were created with the aid of plasticine for figuring out the ergonomics and dimensions of the product. DFM, DFA, DFE, D 4 S were used for taking into account costs, assembly, dimensions and environmental impacts of this product. One of the concepts could replace the existing parking <b>brake</b> <b>switch</b> and suit in different cabins because of its size and design. This concept can be located on vertical or on horizontal plane. The other final concept solution functions better for the  articulated hauler on account of the double function with exhausting brake system activating before parking brake system. Suggestion for next steps for the project could be to make prototypes of the two concepts and test these components in real machines. Also interviewing users for further development of the final concepts and redesign if needed...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{brake systems}} using a mechanical-structure-based contact switch {{with a metal}} spring suffer from {{frequent}} malfunction problems over time caused by unstable contacts stemming from loose tension of the spring, a faulty air gap, and damage to the contact point due to overcurrent from load. In this paper, a novel contactless switch for brake systems using an eddy-current displacement sensor is proposed, fabricated, and verified to have reliable performance that overcomes conventional contact switch problems. A proposed contactless switch was fabricated using automotive-grade surface-mount devices (SMDs) {{on both sides of}} an FR- 4 printed circuit board for low-cost implementation. The measurement result shows a switching speed of less than 49. 7 mu s, on average, which is approximately ten times faster than conventional mechanical-structure-based contact switches. The overall dimension of the proposed switch is 36 mm x 26 mm x 64 mm, which can fit into most <b>brake</b> <b>switch</b> housings. The operating input voltage range is from + 8 V to + 22 V, with the temperature ranging from - 40 degrees C to + 85 degrees C, showing reliable performance under harsh environment test for automobile applications. close...|$|E

40|$|Hybrid {{vehicles}} {{usually have}} several braking systems, and <b>braking</b> mode <b>switches</b> are significant events during braking. It {{is difficult to}} coordinate torque fluctuations caused by mode switches because the dynamic {{characteristics of braking systems}} are different. In this study, a new type of plug-in hybrid vehicle is taken as the research object, and <b>braking</b> mode <b>switches</b> are divided into two types. The control strategy of type one is achieved by controlling the change rates of clutch hold-down and motor braking forces. The control strategy of type two is achieved by simultaneously changing the target braking torque during different mode switch stages and controlling the motor to participate in active coordination control. Finally, the torque coordination control strategy is modeled in MATLAB/Simulink, and the results show that the proposed control strategy has a good effect in reducing the braking torque fluctuation and vehicle shocks during <b>braking</b> mode <b>switches...</b>|$|R

50|$|The Kunze-Knorr brake (Kunze-Knorr-Bremse or KK-Bremse) is an {{automatic}} compressed-air brake for goods, passenger and express trains.

The Deutsche Reichsbahn alone put the cost of equipping German goods wagons with Kunze-Knorr brakes between 1918 and 1927 at 478.4 million Reichsmarks.

40|$|Today, VVVF {{inverter}} control systems using induction motors {{are the main}} type of drive system for trains.

All of these factors mean that these systems can be made smaller and more lightweight. Because induction motors use external air for cooling, however, they require periodic maintenance to clean the interior of the motor, and inspection of the bearings and grease used. In addition, the power of the motor is transmitted to the wheels through the cardan shaft driving device (reduction gear unit) - the same system used in DC motors- which transmits power through deceleration. Therefore, inspection of the gears, replacement of lubricants, and other maintenance is necessary...|$|R
5000|$|During this period, the United States was the {{destination}} {{of millions of}} immigrants. Previous immigration had mostly come from western and northern Europe, but during this period Pennsylvania experienced heavy immigration from southern and eastern Europe. As many new immigrants were Catholic and Jewish, they changed the demographics of major cities and industrial areas. Pennsylvania and New York received {{many of the new}} immigrants, who entered through New York and Philadelphia and worked in the developing industries. Many of these poor immigrants took jobs in factories, steel mills, and coal mines throughout the state, where they were not restricted because of their lack of English. The availability of jobs and public education systems helped integrate the millions of immigrants and their families, who also retained ethnic cultures. Pennsylvania also experienced the Great Migration, in which millions of African Americans migrated from the southern United States to other locations in the United States. By 1940, African Americans made up almost five percent of the state's population.Even before the Civil War, Pennsylvania had emerged as a center of scientific discovery, and the state, led by its two major urban centers, continued to be a major place of innovation. The state continued to innovate, as Pennsylvanians invented the first iron and steel t-rails, iron bridges, air <b>brakes,</b> <b>switching</b> signals, and drawn metal wires. Pennsylvanians also contributed to advances in aluminum production, radio, television, airplanes, and farm machinery. During this period, Pittsburgh emerged as an important center of industry and technological innovation, and George Westinghouse became one of the preeminent inventors of the United States. Philadelphia became one of the leading medical science centers in the nation, although it no longer rivaled New York City as a financial capital. Frederick Winslow Taylor pioneered the field of scientific management, becoming America's first [...] "efficiency engineer."
