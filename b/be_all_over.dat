The neighbor indicated that he did not recognize him due to the severity of Petit's injuries. In court testimony, William Petit stated that he felt a [...] "jolt of adrenaline" [...] coupled with a need to escape upon hearing one of the perpetrators state: [...] "Don't worry, it's going to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> in a couple of minutes." [...] Petit then told the jury, [...] "I thought, it's now or never because in my mind at that moment, I {{thought they were going to}} shoot all of us." ...|$|E
500|$|Survivors {{participated in}} a {{publicity}} campaign to expand attention to the case. Langley and Lee Ruth Davis appeared on The Maury Povich Show on Martin Luther King Day in 1993. Gary Moore published another article about Rosewood in the Miami Herald on March 7, 1993; he had {{to negotiate with the}} newspaper's editors for about a year to publish it. At first they were skeptical that the incident had taken place, and secondly, reporter Lori Rosza of the Miami Herald had reported on the first stage of what proved in December 1992 to be a deceptive claims case, with most of the survivors excluded. [...] "If something like that really happened, we figured, it would <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the history books", an editor wrote.|$|E

She called him her [...] "friend" [...] and explained that on this account Cassandra must be anxious {{to know more about}} her new [...] "friend". Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote she expected an [...] "offer" [...] from her [...] "friend" [...] and that [...] "I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat", going on to write [...] "I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't give a sixpence" [...] and refuse all others. The next day, Austen wrote: [...] "The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>over.</b> My tears flow as I write at this melancholy idea".|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} praised for its {{political}} satire. Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict called the episode a [...] "biting political satire {{in the guise}} of a children's oratory contest", that [...] "signifies that this season of the series will <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the map, both emotionally and logically." [...] Gibron added: [...] "Everything, from the Reader's Digest rants to the formulaic speeches of the youths, has a resounding ring of truth. And once the story moves to Washington D.C, our nation's capital is in for a royal reaming as well." [...] Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said the episode solidified the series' politically satirical voice as it [...] "bitch slapped the Bush administration" [...] that would later badmouth The Simpsons. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson, however, gave the episode a more negative review, stating that it [...] "has its moments but never seems like one of the series’ better programs. Part of that stems from its somewhat icky ending. The show exhibits a tone that feels more appropriate to a less biting and cynical series. It starts well with Homer’s obsession with Reading Digest. After that, the show seems more erratic, and it remains pretty average overall." ...|$|E

[...] He wished to express an earnest plea for Marcos to step down, for a peaceful regime change and a return to democratic institutions. Anticipating the worst, at an interview in his suite at the Taipei Grand Hotel, he revealed that he would be wearing a bullet-proof vest, but he also said that [...] "it's only good for the body, but in the head there's nothing else we can do." [...] Sensing his own doom, he told the journalists accompanying him on the flight, [...] "You have to be very ready with your hand camera because this action can become very fast. In a matter of a three or four minutes it could <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>over,</b> you know, and [...] I {{may not be able to}} talk to you again after this."

2500|$|In the final, India {{lost the}} toss and {{were made to}} bat first on a seaming wicket against the mighty West Indian pace attack. Only Srikkanth (38 from 57 balls, 7 fours and 1 six) and Amarnath (26 from 80 balls, 3 fours) put up any {{significant}} resistance as the West Indian fast bowling attack comprising Marshall (2/24), Andy Roberts (3/32), Joel Garner (1/24) and Michael Holding (2/26) ripped through the Indian batting, ably supported by part-timer Larry Gomes (2/49). Only surprising resistance by the tail allowed India to reach 183 all out in the 55th over. It seemed to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> for India, as the West Indies had a power-packed batting line-up comprising openers Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes, followed by Vivian Richards and captain Clive Lloyd which was capable of destroying any bowling attack and were widely expected to make mincemeat out of the [...] "mediocre" [...] Indian bowling attack. Despite the early loss of Greenidge, Haynes and Richards steadied the innings and the West Indies was soon cruising to another World Cup win at 57/2. At this stage, Kapil ran a great distance (18-20 yards) to take the wicket of Richards off Madan Lal's bowling. This {{proved to be the}} turning point of the match, as the Indian bowling then exploited the weather and pitch conditions perfectly to blow away the rest of the West Indian batting. Amarnath (3/12) and Madan Lal (3/31) took three wickets each, as the West Indies crashed to 140 all out in the 53rd over, setting up a famous tournament victory for India {{which was one of the}} biggest upsets not only in cricket, but in sport in general. India's win ended the title defence of the West Indies, who never reached the final of the Cricket World Cup again. Amarnath was awarded a second consecutive Man of the Match award for another all-round effort.|$|E
