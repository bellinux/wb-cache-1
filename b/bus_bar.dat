25|$|In {{conjunction}} with London Transport from 1937 Leyland developed the Tiger FEC, the initials stood for flat-engined coach. The Leyland 8.6-litre engine (with revised sump) was mounted horizontally in mid wheel-base driving through a Wilson fluid-flywheel and an air-actuated AEC mechanical pre-selector gearbox. The gearbox was {{basically the same}} as used in the STL but it was fitted with an externally mounted air cylinder which actuated the <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> to engage and disengage the gears. It worked in the opposite way from that in the slightly later RT type double decker in that air pressure was used to disengage the gears instead of being used to keep them engaged. When the gear change pedal was released it allowed the selected gear to engage by means of spring pressure in that {{same way as the}} gearbox in the STL. The system caused problems in that if a vehicle was left with a gear engaged and the air pressure leaked off {{it was not possible to}} disengage that gear until air pressure had been built up again. Because of this, there were a number of garage incidents caused by vehicles being left overnight with a gear still engaged. 88 of this type were built and 12 were destroyed during World War Two, the rest serving until 1954-5 as Green Line coaches.|$|E

2500|$|The Alpine Sleigh Ride {{was a dark}} ride {{attraction}} {{which opened}} during the park's first season. It had a ride control system and vehicles (ArrowGlide) designed by Arrow Development. Riders passed through an alpine forest before reaching the show building {{which was designed to}} resemble a large mountain capped with snow. A waterfall cascaded from atop the mountain and down into a catch pond near the mountain's base. Once past the waterfall, riders would journey through many chambers within the mountain. These included an echo tunnel and an avalanche room with simulated snow. At several points throughout the ride, the vehicles would exit and travel along the exterior of the mountain-themed show building. The sleigh-themed vehicles were powered by an electrical <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> where portions of the track ascended, and they were gravity powered during the descents which featured several surprise dips. Part of the show building was shared with the adjacent gas powered car ride (Le Taxi) which passed through a tunnel {{in the side of the}} mountain. The ride included an appearance by the [...] "Abominable Snowman". Alpine Sleigh Ride was retired after the 1983 operating season.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bus</b> <b>bars</b> on {{solar cells}} shade silicon from light. When the <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> are patterned, they can reflect light {{back onto the}} silicon using total {{internal}} reflection. These patterned <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> are tin plated and produce 1 - 2. 5 % improvement in module efficiency [6]. There is a potential for even greater improvement by using higher reflectivity metal plating on the <b>bus</b> <b>bars.</b> Silver is the most reflective of all metals, but is also very expensive. We tested to see if silver would actually be as reflective as published values and if silver could redirect {{a substantial amount of}} light using total internal reflection. We found that silver plating followed the published spectral dependence curve with little deviation, and would reflect 18. 4 % more light than the published values for tin. Plating 2. 24 microns resulted in 94. 9 % of reflected light undergoing TIR; the most reflected light of any tested material. Finally, given the current cost of silver is $ 430 per kilogram and the variable cost of a solar cell is $ 2 per Watt, the maximum allowable thickness we could afford to plate is 44. 8 microns. In our testing, plating as little as 0. 35 microns produced a very high light capture. The benefit of silver plating patterned <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> far outweighs the material costs. by Christine Eve Winiarz. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Solar cells used in {{photovoltaic}} (PV) crystalline silicon modules commonly feature {{grid fingers}} and <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> as front contacts. The grid fingers and <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> partially block the sunlight {{from reaching the}} semiconductor layers of a solar cell and therefore reduce the efficiency of a solar module. In this paper, we present experimental results of different technologies to reduce the shadowing effect that <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> and grid fingers impose. We focus on two technologies {{that can be easily}} integrated into standard PV module technology and help to increase the module's efficiency. In the first technology, a laser is used to create a scattering pattern on the front glass of the module. This pattern directs light away from the <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> and grid fingers. In the second technology, the bus wires are coated with a diffuse reflective coating. The sunlight is diffusely reflected at this coating. A part of it is reflected at such angles that internal reflection at the front surface of t he cover glass occurs. From there the light is reflected back to the solar cell and contributes to the generated photocurrent...|$|R

40|$|Operation of {{switchgear}} {{equipment in}} high voltage substations {{results in the}} propagation of transient currents in <b>bus</b> <b>bars.</b> The <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> temporarily act as antennae, producing transient electromagnetic fields within the substations. With {{the introduction of new}} technology (microelectronics) into the substations for measurement and control purposes, there is renewed interest in the assessment of the electromagnetic environment of substations to ensure electromagnetic compatibility. This assessment is gaining increased importance as new equipment could be located very close to the switch being operated, potentially making the electronic equipment more vulnerable to disturbance. This paper discusses the prediction of transient electromagnetic field emissions due to switching operations in a typical 400 kV air insulated substation using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. Electromagnetic fields radiated by <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> due to transient currents during switching were evaluated at various positions within the substation.
