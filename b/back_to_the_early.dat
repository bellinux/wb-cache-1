5|$|Against long-circulating speculations {{that his}} family has French roots, genealogists proved the German origin of Rockefeller and traced them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 17th century. Thereupon Johann Peter Rockenfeller (baptized 27 September 1682 in the Protestant church of Rengsdorf) immigrated in 1723 from Altwied (today a {{district}} of Neuwied, Rhineland-Palatinate) with three children to North America and settled down in Germantown, Pennsylvania.|$|E

After World War I, broaching was used to rifle gun barrels. In the 1920s and 30s the tolerances were tightened and the cost reduced thanks to advances in form grinding and broaching machines.|$|E
5|$|Although Massachusetts was {{the first}} slave-holding colony dating <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1600s, in the {{years leading up to}} the American Civil War, Massachusetts was a center of progressivist and {{abolitionist}} activity.

Members of the transcendentalist movement emphasized the importance of the natural world and emotion to humanity.|$|E
5|$|Caversham has no {{secondary}} schools, {{although it}} does contain two primary schools and a special needs school.

5|$|The {{history of}} the Auxois is closely tied to its homeland, {{for which it is}} named.

The recognition of the Auxois dates <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 20th century, making it relatively new compared to other French draft breeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{number and}} {{strength}} of Atlantic hurricanes may undergo a 50–70 year cycle, {{also known as the}} Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Nyberg et al. reconstructed Atlantic major hurricane activity <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 18th century and found five periods averaging 3–5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 40–60 years, and six other averaging 1.5–2.5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 10–20 years. These periods are associated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Throughout, a decadal oscillation related to solar irradiance was responsible for enhancing/dampening the number of major hurricanes by 1–2 per year.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} NY37B date <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 20th century when the New York State Legislature created Route32, an {{unsigned}} legislative route extending from North Lawrence to Ogdensburg via Massena.

In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the Waddington–Massena segment of NY3 became NY37B. The route was extended east into Massena in the 1950s after NY37 was realigned to follow a new bypass around the village.|$|E
