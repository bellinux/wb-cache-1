500|$|Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Andrew Hanson {{questioned}} whether the writers had been using drugs lately because of the surge of drug-related episodes; though he loved it, he acknowledged that the episode was one [...] "you are either going to love or hate", explaining that it [...] "got a little crazy using Olivia’s mind as a setting, [...] it stays grounded through the emotional current running underneath... {{you have to give}} Fringe credit for taking a risky, bold move." [...] SFScope writer Sarah Stegall called the episode [...] "brilliant, risky, fascinating, and dangerous. It's not a tack this show can afford to take very often, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> when it does." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} by Anime News Network, {{reviewer}} Gabriella Ekens praised the series for [...] "sculpting singular, evocative moments", but {{went on to}} say that a [...] "problem arises when you try to tie them into a bigger picture." [...] Ekens criticized the pacing and structure of the show, calling it an [...] "inefficient...collection of sprawling narrative ideas" [...] and comparing it to [...] " [...] suddenly turn into Darker than Black." [...] Ekens also notes that its thematic purpose [...] "seems to be Jun Maeda's opportunity for melodramatic elaboration on the emotional dilemmas posed by Madoka Magica." [...] Overall, Charlotte was lauded for its entertainment value and unpredictability, but [...] "disappoints as a work of art." [...] Early on, Ekens described the series as having [...] "sharp comedic timing," [...] and by episode four, she praised the comedic elements as [...] "already much funnier than Plastic Memories." [...] She {{went on to say}} that [...] "it's dumb, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> for the same reasons I liked the comedy in [...]" [...] Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post found Charlotte unpredictability [...] "engaging" [...] and its animation [...] "beautiful". Ekens praised P.A. Works for their dynamic direction and [...] "expressive cinematography" [...] which offers [...] "a distinct, pleasant aesthetic." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 12, Martin was the 975th young hopeful to be {{auditioned for}} the role of Velvet Brown in the NBC {{television}} version of National Velvet, the role for which she is best remembered. After being included in the final three, she was interviewed ten more times before winning the part. Ann Doran played her mother, Martha Brown; Arthur Space, her father, Herbert Brown. When she won the role, her name was changed from Dawn Menzer to [...] "Lori Martin". On the change of name, Martin later said that, [...] "I didn't like the name Lori at first. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> now. The reason I like it now is I've been brainwashed!" [...] The show ran for fifty-eight episodes between 1960 and 1962.|$|E
500|$|... "I’m {{really happy}} {{and want to}} thank my {{teammates}} who helped me too much during the race. This is the biggest win of my career so far," [...] Spilak said. [...] "The time trial was really hard <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it.</b> It was up and down {{all the way and}} that helped me. I gave it everything." [...] It was the Slovenian's tenth victory in the professional ranks.|$|R
500|$|Reviewer Peter Martin confided, [...] "The Warped Ones baffled and mystified me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> very much." [...] J.R. Jones, for The Reader's Guide to Arts & Entertainment, {{found the}} film [...] "actually celebrates the values it's {{supposed}} to be condemning," [...] but recommended it for its kineticism and action. TV Guide and Allmovie did not recommended it, both gave it one star in their respective four and five star rating systems.|$|R
5000|$|... "Agia Varvara then, and {{especially}} where we lived, was empty. A few houses, endless fields, {{and quite a}} few gypsies with their bears and their songs. There was great poverty <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> there. I’d wander around barefoot all day, run, play with the other children, fall, hurt myself, get up {{and do the same}} all over again. There was however civility and compassion, a feeling for others which I think has slowly vanished with the years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] {{answered}} the youngest Miss Halleck. [...] "It's a perfect chamber of horrors. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> because everything's so exquisitely in keeping." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose it's {{the right}} way to feel everywhere, when one IS nobody. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> in a church as little as {{anywhere}} else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'For {{all that}} we cannot rest,' said Saxon. 'We may not be out of danger yet. Another mile or two may shake us clear. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> not.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Troublesome. Well; yes; it is troublesome. Nothing good {{is to be}} had without trouble. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>it</b> if {{you would}} not mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your face is very thin, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>it</b> less," [...] she said. [...] "You haven't {{come back}} the same, Bob; I think you have grown." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{tell you}} I did everything. I was a waitress, {{and a very}} bad one. I broke plates. I muddled orders. Finally I was very rude to a {{customer}} and I went on to try something else. I forget what came next. I {{think it was the}} stage. I travelled for a year with a touring company. That was hard work, too, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it.</b> After that came dressmaking, which was harder and which I hated. And then I had my first stroke of real luck.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There are no {{circumstances}} to trust to. We {{may as well}} trust in Providence if we trust at all. But here we are. A wild place, isn't it? <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> on such days as these.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{may be a}} word or {{two that}} might be changed," [...] she answered, rather absently. [...] "I shall have to think it over, to live with it a little. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> and that's all I wanted to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} it," [...] I said. Indeed, {{nearly all the}} women had seemed to be wearing {{variants}} of that simple formula. [...] "It {{seems to me a}} very beautiful dress. The other--I'm not used to. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> on girls and slender women." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>it</b> best if {{it could}} not be till then?' It seemed to be still her {{instinct}} to delay the marriage to the utmost.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> it; <b>it</b> {{reminds me}} so pleasantly that {{everything}} here in dear old Hintock {{is just as}} it used to be. The oil is--not quite nice; but everything else is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} give him that trouble," [...] I answered. [...] "I will go, if no better may be; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've had to {{give them}} up. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> so better than having to give YOU up! I took you first with their assent. That was well enough--it was worth trying for. But now I take you without it. We can live that way too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I never {{discovered}} what an accomplished woman I was till I came here," [...] answered Christie, laughing. [...] "I'm getting vain {{with so much}} praise, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> immensely, and never was so pleased in my life as I was yesterday when Dr. Harvey came {{for me to take}} care of poor Dunbar, because no one else could manage him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. In Kansas she was Dorothy Gale. I used to {{know her}} there, and she {{brought me to the}} Land of Oz. But now Ozma has made her a Princess, and Dorothy's Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are here, too." [...] Here the Shaggy Man uttered a long sigh, and then he continued: [...] "It's a queer country, this Land of Oz; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> nevertheless." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true enough, sir; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>it</b> for all that. However, if {{you have}} made up your mind to it, {{there is nothing more}} to be said." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{was talking}} with my {{colleague}} {{about the possibility of}} an object-oriented scripting language. I knew Perl (Perl4, not Perl5), <b>but</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>like</b> <b>it</b> really, because it had the smell of a toy language (it still has). The object-oriented language seemed very promising. I knew Python then. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> because <b>I</b> didn't think it was a true object-oriented language — OO features appeared to be add-on to the language. As a language maniac and OO fan for 15 years, I really wanted a genuine object-oriented, easy-to-use scripting language. <b>I</b> looked for <b>but</b> couldn't find one. So I decided to make it.|$|R
6000|$|Shanks {{said nothing}} and Jim went off. When {{they were out}} of hearing Jake remarked: [...] "I allow you had to be firm, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> Jim. Those fellows are what we call bad men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma, {{it was a}} {{beautiful}} surprise, and I thank you so much! I don't see how you did it; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> best of all the Christmases I ever had, and mean to make one every year. I had my splendid big present, and here is the dear little one to keep for love of poor Katy; so even that part of my wish came true." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> {{best when}} it is awake, when it blows a hurricane-- it is magnificent. The whole cliff shakes with {{the shock of the}} waves, and {{sometimes}} the spray drives over in sheets. That is when I like to sit here; it exhilarates me, and makes me feel as though I belonged to the storm, and was strong with its strength. Come, let us go in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{in and see}} the house," [...] said Bertha, in brusque invitation. [...] "It isn't ship-shape yet. I {{wanted to}} do it all myself, but I find it's a big {{proposition}} to go up against. It sure is. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> I'd like nothing better than running a big hotel--not too big, but just big enough. I tell the Captain that when our mines 'pinch out' I'll go to Denver and start a hotel." ...|$|E
6000|$|So, drat him, we went along, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>like</b> <b>it</b> much. When {{we got in}} we couldn't {{hardly see}} anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is very nice, {{and very}} refreshing. There is another drink {{that is coming}} into fashion. It is called tea. I have tasted it a few times, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>it</b> as well as coffee, and {{it is much more}} expensive." ...|$|R
2500|$|Yes, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> {{have to do}} <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>it</b> at {{all because}} <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> the kind of voice I have. I really hate {{listening}} to myself! The first time I listened to a recording of my singing was when we were recording San Giovanni Battista by Stradella in a church in Perugia in 1949. They made me listen to the tape and I cried my eyes out. I wanted to stop everything, to give up singing... Also now even though <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> my voice, I've become able to accept it and to be detached and objective about it so I can say, [...] "Oh, that was really well sung," [...] or [...] "It was nearly perfect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Auntie, I will promise--from to-day--to {{have some}} dignity. I've been free {{as a boy}} in these rider clothes. As I am now the men never seem to regard me as a girl. Somehow that's better. I can't explain, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> My dresses are what have caused all the trouble. I know that. But if I'm grown up--if it's so tremendous--then I'll wear a dress all the time, except just WHEN I ride. Will that do, Auntie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think nothin'," [...] said she. [...] "Just {{as soon as}} I {{begin to}} look at them wrigglin' in the wind, and I am beginnin' to wonder what it is I think about them, I go slam bang to sleep, and when I wake up and try to think again what it is I think, off I go again. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> If I don't know what it is I think, I ought to know that I don't know it. That's what I call bein' really and truly a hermick." ...|$|E
60|$|DEAR HENLEY, - You may be {{surprised}} to hear that I am now a great writer of verses; that is, however, so. I have the mania now like my betters, and faith, if I live till I am forty, I shall have a book of rhymes like Pollock, Gosse, or whom you please. Really, I have begun to learn some of the rudiments of that trade, and have written three or four pretty enough pieces of octosyllabic nonsense, semi-serious, semi-smiling. A kind of prose Herrick, divested of the gift of verse, and you behold the Bard. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{all very}} well to lie to, this way," [...] he went on, [...] "for the comfort and safety of the {{passengers}} and the ship, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> for we're not keeping on to our port, which is what I want to be doing." ...|$|R
