5|$|In London, M assigns <b>Bond</b> <b>to</b> {{investigate}} the attack. He flies to Saint Petersburg to meet CIA operative Jack Wade, who suggests that Bond meet with Valentin Zukovsky, a former KGB agent and business rival of Janus. Zukovsky arranges {{a meeting between}} Bond and Janus. Onatopp surprises Bond at the Grand Hotel Europe and attempts to kill him, but he overpowers her. She takes <b>Bond</b> <b>to</b> Janus, who reveals himself as Trevelyan; he faked his death at Arkhangelsk but was badly scarred by the explosion. A descendant of the Cossack clans who collaborated with the Nazi forces in the Second World War, Trevelyan had vowed revenge against the British after they betrayed the Cossacks, which drove his father to kill Trevelyan's mother and himself. Just as Bond is about to shoot Trevelyan, Bond is shot with a tranquilizer dart.|$|E

40|$|The {{structural}} {{diversity of}} arsenic sulfide molecules in compositions between As 4 S 6 and As 4 was investigated using ab initio quantum chemical calculations. The As 4 S 6 molecule {{consists of four}} trigonal pyramid coordinations of As atoms <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> three S atoms. In the As 4 S 5 composition, only one type of molecular configuration corresponds to an uzonite-type molecule. In the As 4 S 4 composition, two molecular configurations exist with realgar-type and pararealgar-type molecules. Three molecular configurations are in the As 4 S 3 composition. The first configuration comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of two types: <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> two S atoms and one As atom, and <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> one S atom and two As atoms. The second is the molecular configuration of dimorphite. The third comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of two types: <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> three As atoms, and <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> one As atom and two S atoms. The As 4 S 2 composition allows molecular configurations of two types. One is comprised of trigonal pyramidal As atom configurations of one type <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> two As atoms and one S atom. The other comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of three types: <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> two S atoms and one As atoms, <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> one S atom and two As atoms, and <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> three As atoms. The As 4 S molecule has trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of two types: <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> one S atom and two As atoms, and <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> three As atoms. The As 4 S composition permits only one molecular configuration, {{which suggests that the}} mineral duranusite comprises the As 4 S molecular geometry. In all, ten molecular configurations are predicted in the molecular hierarchy of the arsenic sulfide binary system. The simulated Raman spectral profiles are helpful in searching for undiscovered arsenic sulfide minerals...|$|R

5|$|Analogous to its lighter congeners, the nonbonding {{electrons}} on unbiunium in UbuF {{are expected}} to be able to <b>bond</b> <b>to</b> extra atoms or groups, resulting {{in the formation of the}} unbiunium trihalides UbuX3, continuing the trends of existence of ScX3, YX3, LaX3, and AcX3. Hence, the main oxidation state of unbiunium in its compounds should be +3, although the closeness of the valence subshells' energy levels may permit higher oxidation states, just like in elements 119 and 120. The standard electrode potential for the Ubu3+/Ubu couple is predicted as −2.1V.|$|E
5000|$|There {{can also}} be off-resonance {{decoupling}} of 1H from 13C nuclei in 13C NMR spectroscopy, where weaker rf irradiation results in what {{can be thought of}} as partial decoupling. In such an off-resonance decoupled spectrum, only 1H atoms <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> a carbon atom will split its 13C signal. The coupling constant, indicating a small frequency difference between split signal peaks, would be smaller than in an undecoupled spectrum. [...] Looking at a compound's off-resonance proton-decoupled 13C spectrum can show how many hydrogens are <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> the carbon atoms to further help elucidate the chemical structure. For most organic compounds, carbons <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> 3 hydrogens (methyls) would appear as quartets (4-peak signals), carbons <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> 2 equivalent hydrogens would appear as triplets (3-peak signals), carbons <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> 1 hydrogen would be doublets (2-peak signals), and carbons not <b>bonded</b> directly <b>to</b> any hydrogens would be singlets (1-peak signals).|$|R
