40|$|A load {{calibration}} of the NASA 13 -in {{magnetic suspension}} and balance system (MSBS) is described. The calibration procedure was {{originally intended to}} establish the empirical relationship between the coil currents and the external loads (forces and moments) applied to a magnetically suspended calibrator. However, {{it was discovered that}} the performance of a strain-gage balance is not affected when subjected to the magnetic environment of the MSBS. The use of strain-gage balances greatly reduces the effort required to perform a current-vs. -load calibration as external loads can be directly inferred from the <b>balance</b> <b>outputs</b> while a calibrator is suspended in MSBS. It is conceivable that in the future such a calibration could become unnecessary, since an even more important application for the use of a strain-gage balance in MSBS environment is the acquisition of precision aerodynamic force and moment data by telemetering the <b>balance</b> <b>outputs</b> from a suspended model/core/balance during wind tunnel tests...|$|R

The proper <b>balanced</b> <b>outputs</b> and BPF characteristic by the symmetric feeding and skew-symmetric feeding have been obtained, and the theory of this simple structure for unbalanced input to <b>balanced</b> <b>outputs</b> has been studied. The center frequency of the fabricated balun-BPF was operated at 2. 4 GHz with 5. 8 % fractional bandwidth (FBW), and this frequency is used for Bluetooth and some other communication systems.

50|$|Generally a balun {{consists}} of two wires (primary and secondary) and a toroid core: it converts the electrical energy of the primary wire into a magnetic field.

The coil is typically wound on a ferrite rod or doughnut-shaped toroid. One can also make an autotransformer from an ordinary transformer by cross-wiring the primary and secondary windings. Baluns made with autotransformer windings are also called “Voltage baluns”, since they produce <b>balanced</b> <b>output</b> voltage, but not necessarily balanced current.|$|E

Both these speaker models, while highly regarded as [...] "breakthrough" [...] designs with outstanding high-frequency clarity, are also known for a somewhat [...] "depressed" [...] sounding high-frequency range, {{as a result of the}} relatively heavy copper dome tweeter. Later iterations of this design deployed a similar tweeter, but with the dome made out of aluminum, a much lighter and more efficient driver, which allowed for a more <b>balanced</b> <b>output</b> with the woofer. The aluminium-domed versions, in the standard cabinet (MDF and wood veneer) were designated as the SL6s, and then (with an improved crossover and woofer surround) the SL6si; The aluminium-domed models using the Aerolam cabinet (the honeycomb alloy) were designated as the SL700 and the (improved) SL700SE which dual inputs—i.e., separate inputs for woofer and tweeter (allowing for bi-amping or bi-wiring). Around that same era, another version of the copper-domed model, with both the Aerolam cabinet and improved crossover elements, was marketed as the SL600si, also with dual inputs. Finally, in 1992, Celestion produced the final variation of this design, as the Ten Year [...] "Anniversary Edition" [...] Model 100, which featured a conventional, but highly refined MDF / wood veneer cabinet, dual inputs, updated mounted plates, an improved crossover, the improved woofer design, and a variation of the aluminium tweeter with an updated faceplate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, various {{architectures}} of 3 D compact microwave balanced to unbalanced (balun) transformers for Bluetooth/WiFi antenna {{applications are}} successfully designed and optimized using the Design of Experiments (DOE) approach. Two different multilayer topologies, one microstrip and one stripline, are investigated on Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) substrate. The design goals for both baluns are perfectly <b>balanced</b> <b>outputs</b> from 2 to 3 GHz and a resonant frequency of exactly 2. 4 GHz. It is demonstrated, using only eight simulations, that perfectly <b>balanced</b> <b>outputs</b> are not possible under the given {{conditions in the}} case of the microstrip balun. Nevertheless, the stripline balun can be optimized due to its almost symmetrical structure, and both simulations and measurement results verify the conclusions. The DOE method is very simple to implement and gives a clear understanding of the system behavior at the beginning of the design process, reducing the amount of work required for achieving the design goals by orders of magnitude compared to the widely used trial-and-error approach. The matching and unique measurement issues regarding the calibration, placement of probes and the deembedding of the microstrip to coplanar waveguide (CPW) transitions are discussed in detail for the optimized stripline balun.
