5|$|The {{station at}} Jordanhill is to <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt,</b> {{one of six}} new {{stations}} in the west of Scotland, according to an announcement made on 19 May 2006 by SPT chief executive Ron Culley.|$|E
5|$|When 74 Ts {{turbines}} {{were initially}} installed, {{the problems with}} them were so significant that all her power and propulsion machinery had to <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt.</b> She was launched {{for a second time}} on 26 June 1914.|$|E

5|$|Debts {{continued}} to increase, as the commissioners borrowed {{more money to}} fund the improvements. The new weir and lock at Pickerings failed in 1761 and both had to <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt.</b> Work had started on Witton Brook in 1756, but the plans were revised in 1764 to increase the navigable depth to , and this work was completed in 1765.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{scorched}} earth {{tactics of}} retreating Wehrmacht troops, large areas in Northern Norway needed to <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt.</b> In 1945, {{there was an}} overwhelming need for housing. An architectural competition produced several designs for simple, cost-effective, and rapidly assembled housing. The resulting houses were Spartan and broke with building standards, but met an immediate need for shelter.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Iniki's {{high winds}} caused {{extensive}} damage in Kauai. 1,421houses were destroyed, and 63 were lost {{from the storm}} surge and wave action. A total of 5,152homes were severely damaged, while 7,178 received minor damage. On the south coast, hotels and condominiums received severe damage as well. A few were restored quickly, though some took several years to <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt.</b> One hotel—the Coco Palms Resort famous for Elvis Presley's Blue Hawaii—never reopened after the hurricane.|$|E
50|$|In 90’s, villa <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt</b> as a 4-star {{hotel and}} a restaurant. Part {{of the mill}} <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt</b> as subsidized housing.|$|R
50|$|The church, which <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt</b> in {{the period}} 1740-1743, was {{destroyed}} by the 1783 Calabrian earthquakes. In March 1786 the church <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1742 {{an evangelical}} prayer house was built, which <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt</b> in the Baroque style in 1751. After its {{destruction}} 1945, it <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1941, {{during the}} Second World War, the {{building}} was destroyed by an incendiary bomb in the London Blitz. Despite much lobbying for the hall to <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt,</b> the government decided against doing so. The main musical functions of the Queen's Hall were {{taken over by the}} Royal Albert Hall for the Proms, and the new Royal Festival Hall for the general concert season.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, British Land {{announced}} that it had won the tender to demolish and rebuild the station, spending some £250m of its overall redevelopment budget of £1bn for the area. The number of platforms would increase from 18 to 21. In 2008, {{it was reported that}} the Arch could <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt.</b> In September 2011, the demolition plans were cancelled, and Aedas was appointed to give the station a makeover.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Park {{is built}} {{on top of a}} large {{underground}} parking garage. Construction started before the park's design was completed, and in January 2000, 17 additional caissons had {{to be added to the}} partially built garage to support the weight of Gehry's pavilion. In April the tops of all these caissons had to <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt</b> for changes in the pavilion's foundation.|$|E
25|$|Brighton {{railway station}} <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt</b> and {{extended}} in 1882/3 {{with a new}} single roof, and Eastbourne <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt</b> in 1886 to cope with additional traffic.|$|R
25|$|Two second rates <b>were</b> <b>rebuilt</b> to the 1741 dimensions, {{although}} initially {{ordered to}} the 1733 figures. The Ramillies <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt</b> in 1743–1749 and the Prince in 1743–1750.|$|R
50|$|The power cars' {{interiors}} <b>were</b> <b>rebuilt</b> between 1976 and 1979. During {{the same}} period 711 to 714 and 726 <b>were</b> <b>rebuilt</b> from side corridor to open layout.|$|R
5|$|On William Cubitt's advice the two {{stations}} in the cemetery were built as temporary structures, in the expectation that {{they would need to}} <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt</b> once the railway was operational and the issues with operating a railway of this unique nature became clearer. Both were designed by Sydney Smirke, who presented his designs to the LNC in March 1854.|$|E
5|$|The Germans also {{suffered}} heavily; the 47th Panzer Corps had committed its last reserves into the battle and could hardly afford {{to maintain its}} defensive line, while the 47th Volksgrenadier Division had suffered over 4,300 casualties during the fighting and the 340th Division had lost nearly 2,000 soldiers. This latter division {{was replaced by the}} 363rd Volksgrenadier and 10th SS Panzer Divisions, as the 340th was pulled out in order to <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} narrow and {{structurally}} unsound, leading {{the authorities to}} rename it Chelsea Bridge to avoid the Royal Family's association with a potential collapse. In 1926 it was proposed that the old bridge <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt</b> or replaced, due to the increased volume of users from population growth, {{and the introduction of}} the automobile. It was demolished during 1934–1937, and replaced by the current structure, which opened in 1937.|$|E
50|$|Two second rates <b>were</b> <b>rebuilt</b> to the 1741 dimensions, {{although}} initially {{ordered to}} the 1733 figures. The Ramillies <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt</b> in 1743-1749 and the Prince in 1743-1750.|$|R

5|$|The first {{station to}} <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt</b> was Old Saybrook, the busy eastern {{terminus}} of the line. The new high-level island platform and pedestrian bridge opened on November 1, 2002. Old Saybrook had previous {{had only a}} single side platform serving {{a relatively small number}} of Amtrak trains; the rebuilt has two platforms serving three tracks, to allow Amtrak trains in both directions to stop or pass even while a SLE train is at the station.|$|E
5|$|The route was {{completed}} in 1975 through California, and by 1977 through Arizona, though the bridge over the Colorado River was not completed until 1978. Since then, the freeway through San Diego has been widened due to increasing congestion, and another portion in Imperial County had to <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt</b> following damage by the remnants of Hurricane Kathleen.|$|E
5|$|A {{transfer}} will {{be constructed}} {{at the eastern}} end of the 125th Street station to connect to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's 125th Street station. A new lower-level mezzanine will house the connection between the two stations, directly connecting to the downtown platform for Lexington Avenue service. The direct connection to the staircases to the upper level will <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt.</b> At the western end of the station, a transfer will be built to connect to the Harlem–125th Street station of the Metro-North Railroad. An elevator, stairs, and escalators would connect the two stations.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} of her second rebuild, in 1609, she was known as Lion. She <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt</b> at Deptford as a Great ship of 38 guns. In 1640 she <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt</b> again, this time at Woolwich. She <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt</b> for a final time at Chatham in 1658, as a 48-gun third rate ship of the line. By 1677 Lion was {{mounting}} 60 guns.|$|R

A total of 76 Conrail GP9s <b>were</b> <b>rebuilt</b> to GP10s. The Paducah Shops rebuilt 53 Conrail GP9s to GP10s. The first 16 Conrail GP9s <b>were</b> <b>rebuilt</b> to {{the equivalent of a}} GP10 in 1976.

5|$|After {{winning the}} Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England {{in the newly}} {{completed}} Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066. William constructed the Tower of London, {{the first of the}} many Norman castles in England to <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt</b> in stone, in the southeastern corner of the city, to intimidate the native inhabitants. In 1097, William II began the building of Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. The hall became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{territorial}} gains produced by his {{defeat of the}} Persians were lost to the advance of the Muslims, Heraclius still ranks among the great Roman Emperors. His reforms of the government reduced the corruption which had taken hold in Phocas's reign, and he reorganized the military with great success. Ultimately, the reformed Imperial army halted the Muslims in Asia Minor and held on to Carthage for another 60 years, saving a core from which the empire's strength could <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt.</b>|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, Bolliger & Mabillard {{has built}} 112 roller {{coasters}} around the world.
