5|$|The Minor Planet Center classifies the trans-Neptunian object 90377 Sedna as a scattered-disc object. Its {{discoverer}} Michael E. Brown {{has suggested}} instead {{that it should}} be considered an inner Oort-cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc, <b>because,</b> <b>with</b> a perihelion distance of 76 AU, it is too remote to be affected by the gravitational attraction of the outer planets.|$|E

5|$|As {{he makes}} his way further down the city, Foster {{eventually}} arrives in the abandoned subway tunnels. There he discovers that LINC has grown exponentially, {{to the point where he}} is now half-machine, half-organic entity. However, in order to function, LINC needs a human host to share its brain. The current host is Foster's biological father, who is old and has become severely worn out from his symbiosis with LINC. It is revealed that LINC sent for Foster <b>because,</b> <b>with</b> the death of its current host inevitable, it needed a replacement, and only a blood relative would do. Foster ultimately defeats LINC by plugging Joey (now calling himself Ken) into the mainframe. Joey/Ken is able to take control of the system, and he and Foster set about turning Union City into a utopia.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority {{announced}} plans to renovate the train station. This, along the village's plans to revitalize the entire village of Sloatsburg, was thought to give the bland train station a more traditional look. This would include adding a roof to protect commuters and visitors from the elements, such as rain or snow, handicap-accessible ramps for wheelchairs, better lighting, more seats for people to wait, and a heated shelter. (A shelter exists, but is not heated). The village also wants to use a $50,000 grant from the state to construct a large municipal parking lot near the station. This would get more people to use the station, as <b>because</b> <b>with</b> the lack of facilities, the station is under-used. The preliminary design was made by Jeff Livingston, an architect on the Sloatsburg Revitalization Committee.|$|E
5|$|Indiana was {{commissioned}} on 20 November 1895 {{under the command}} of Captain Robley D. Evans. After further trials, the ship joined the North Atlantic Squadron {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Francis M. Bunce, which conducted training exercises along the East Coast of the United States. In late 1896, both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. Heavier clamps were installed, but in February 1896, while conducting fleet maneuvers with the North Atlantic squadron, the Indiana encountered more bad weather and started rolling heavily. Her new captain, Henry Clay Taylor, promptly ordered her back to port for fear the clamps would break again. This convinced the navy that bilge keels—omitted during construction <b>because,</b> <b>with</b> them, the ship could not fit in most American dry docks—were necessary to reduce the rolling, and they were subsequently installed on all three ships of the Indiana-class.|$|E

5|$|One 45-minute {{practice}} session {{was held on}} Thursday before the two races. The session was held on a dry race track upon having dried up from earlier rain. Arthur Pic was the fastest driver {{with a time of}} one minute and 20.556 seconds, two-tenths of a second faster than Rossi in second. Gasly was third-fastest, ahead of Vandoorne. Sergio Canamasas and Raffaele Marciello were fifth and sixth. Richie Stanaway was seventh-fastest, André Negrão eighth, Haryanto ninth and Norman Nato completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Evans caused an brief early red flag period when he stopped his car {{at the top of the}} hall entering Massenet corner, and was unable to set a timed lap. Canamasas went into the Sainte Dévote run-off area, and Marco Sørensen locked his tyres, causing him hit the barriers at Rascasse corner, and reversed out of the turn.

25|$|Whereas in America, the rhythmically accented and {{innovative}} Bebop enjoyed a heyday until the mid-1950s, this music---unlike the Cool Jazz that had also boomed in the 1950s---was a genre German musicians were unaccostomed to.

25|$|In {{the case}} of fields this {{strategy}} works only for addition. For multiplication it fails because 0 {{does not have a}} multiplicative inverse. An ad hoc attempt to deal with this would be to define 0−1=0. (This attempt fails, essentially <b>because</b> <b>with</b> this definition 0×0−1=1 is not true.) Therefore, one is naturally led to allow partial functions, i.e., functions that are defined only on a subset of their domain. However, there are several obvious ways to generalize notions such as substructure, homomorphism and identity.|$|E
