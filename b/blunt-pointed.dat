60|$|In {{addition}} to these powders, the traveller will want Warburg's fever-drops; glycerine or cold cream; mustard-paper for blistering; heartburn lozenges; lint; a small roll of diachylon; lunar-caustic, in a proper holder, to touch old sores with, and for snake-bites; a scalpel and a <b>blunt-pointed</b> bistoury, with which to open abcesses (the blades of these should be waxed, {{to keep them from}} rust); a good pair of forceps, to pull out thorns; a couple of needles, to sew up gashes; waxed thread, or better, silver wire. A mild effervescing aperient, like Moxon's is very convenient. Seidlitz-powders are perhaps a little too strong for frequent use in a tropical climate.|$|E
60|$|Man is {{provided}} with two sets of teeth--milk teeth and permanent teeth. The former consist of four incisors, or cutting teeth; two canines, or eyeteeth; and four molars, or grinders, in each jaw--making twenty in all. The latter (Fig. 17) comprise four incisors, two canines, four small grinders, called premolars or false molars, and six large grinders, or true molars, in each jaw--making thirty-two in all. The internal incisors are larger than the external pair, in the upper jaw, smaller than the external pair, in the lower jaw. The crowns of the upper molars exhibit four cusps, or <b>blunt-pointed</b> elevations, and a ridge crosses the crown obliquely, from the inner, anterior cusp to the outer, posterior cusp (Fig. 17 m2). The anterior lower molars have five cusps, three external and two internal. The premolars have two cusps, one internal and one external, of which the outer is the higher.|$|E

50|$|It is {{very closely}} related to Prunus padus (Bird cherry), differing in the {{aristate}} tips to the leaf serration (<b>blunt-pointed</b> in P. padus), and the longer style in the flower.|$|E
50|$|Chrysolepis sempervirens grows {{mostly at}} high elevation, 1000 - 3000 m altitude. The leaves are smaller, 4 - 8 cm long, with an obtuse (<b>blunt-pointed</b> or rounded) apex. The bark is thin and smooth.|$|E
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} produces {{one or more}} flower heads, each up {{to about}} 2 centimeters long. The flower head is lined with flat, glandular, <b>blunt-pointed</b> phyllaries and contains several white or pinkish tubular flowers with protruding anthers.|$|E

50|$|This is {{a petite}} plant growing {{no more than}} a few centimeters tall with {{numerous}} stems which may be erect to prostrate, forming mats or clumps. It is generally gray to yellowish and densely woolly. Green, nearly hairless specimens have been noted. The leaves occur in a basal rosette, each thick but not fleshy, and scoop-shaped with a few lobes along the edges. The leaves are variable in morphology, especially in northern individuals versus southern. There is generally one flower head per stem. It is between about 1 and 2 centimeters long, somewhat cylindrical, hairy but not glandular, and lined with long, flat, <b>blunt-pointed</b> phyllaries. The head contains many white to pink-tinted flowers with large, protruding, darker colored anthers. The fruit is an achene over a centimeter long including its pappus.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{two-point}} discrimination (TPD) test {{is one of}} the most commonly used neurosensory tests to assess mechanoperception in the clinical settings. While there have been numerous studies of functional sensibility of the hand using TPD test, there have been relatively not enough reports on TPD in the orofacial region. Objective The aims of the present study were to determine the normal values of TPD in the six trigeminal sites (the forehead, cheek, mentum, upper lip, lower lip, and the tongue tip) and to investigate the effect of the site, sex, and test modality on the TPD perception. Material and Methods Forty healthy volunteers consisting of age-matched men (20) and women (20) with a mean age of 27. 1 years were recruited. One examiner performed the TPD test using a simple hand-operated device, i. e., by drawing compass with a blunt or sharp-pointed tip. The static TPD with a <b>blunt-pointed</b> tip (STPDB), moving TPD with a <b>blunt-pointed</b> tip (MTPDB), and static TPD with a sharp-pointed tip (STPDS) were measured. The predictors were the site, sex, and test modality, and the outcome variable was the TPD value. Three-way ANOVA was used for statistics. Results The analysis showed a significant effect of the site, sex and test modality on the TPD values. Significant differences between the test sites were observed with the descending order from the forehead and cheek>mentum>upper lip and lower lip>tongue tip and index finger. Women showed lower TPD values than those of men. The STPDS measurements were consistently lower than those of the STPDB and MTPDB. Conclusions The normal values of TPD in this study suggest that the cheek and forehead were less sensitive than other regions evaluated and women were more sensitive than men. The STPDS was the most sensitive test modality...|$|E
40|$|The article {{examines}} the constituent elements of the state emblem of the People’s Republic of Tuva (in its 1935 / 1939 version). We view state emblems as a special type of historical source where constituent emblems and elements are, in fact, reflections of a certain worldview. Emblems of the People’s Republic of Tuva (PRT) originally were full of Buddhist religious symbolism, but {{in the course of}} time it switched over to representing the dominance of the Soviet heraldic symbolism. Among the variety of the PRT’s emblems created between 1921 and 1941, a special place belongs to the 1935 version. In 1939 it was slightly modified, but the basics of the design were left unchanged for several more years. This was a highly original state emblem which had nothing in common with those of USSR, Mongolia, or any of the subsequent emblems of Tuva. The official blazon of the state emblem {{can be found in the}} report of the Chairman of the Presidium of the PRT’s Little Khural to the Great Khural on amendments to the Constitution and on the new Constitution of Tuva (1936). The azure five-petal flower-like escutcheon was traditionally interpreted as an influence of Soviet heraldry – “a <b>blunt-pointed</b> star” – thus imagined as a reflection of the Socialist policy of PRT’s government. A comparative analysis, however, shows that the five-petal design corresponds to the circle of a classical mandala (the sky or space), while the outlines of the PRT matches the central square if the mandala. A rider placed within the outline in this context represents the master of this space. The tinctures fit into this interpretation well: the outline of the PRT is greyish-brown (for earth). All in all, the symbolism of the emblem is a harmonized formula of the world as seen by Tuvans: Space ↔ Earth ↔ masters of the land. We believe that the similarities between the mandala and the PRT’s 1935 / 1939 state emblem are far from a mere coincidence. They prove that old Turkic cultural tradition had been deeply integrated into the Buddhist one and left a deep imprint on Tuvan mentality. Despite the impact of Soviet heraldry on the appearance and interpretation of the state emblem of Tuva, in its basics the emblem remained within the Turko-Mongolian, specifically Tuvan, symbolism...|$|E
