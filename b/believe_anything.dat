25|$|After being rescued, Mulch gives Artemis {{the disk}} {{that had been}} passed off as a gold medallion, which Butler was given earlier in the book. Artemis views the disk and regains his memories. He is {{overcome}} with guilt {{of what he had}} done to the fairies but to Holly the most and for the first time, he apologizes for kidnapping her. He realises that Holly, Butler, and Mulch were the only friends he had. Together, the four friends take on Opal Koboi, knowing that they are the only ones that know she's escaped. It becomes a more difficult task with the LEP on their tail, who still thinks Holly is the one who killed the Commander. The new Commander refuses to <b>believe</b> <b>anything,</b> despite the fact that everyone knows Root was like a father to Holly.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel is}} framed {{as a series}} of letters from Gilbert Markham to his friend and {{brother-in-law}} about the events connected with the meeting of his wife. A mysterious young widow arrives at Wildfell Hall, an Elizabethan mansion which has been empty for many years, with her young son and servant. She lives there in strict seclusion under the assumed name Helen Graham and soon finds herself the victim of local slander. Refusing to <b>believe</b> <b>anything</b> scandalous about her, Gilbert befriends Helen and discovers her past. In her diary, Helen depicts her husband's physical and moral decline through alcohol and her desperate attempts to save their son from his influence in the dissipated aristocratic society from which she ultimately flees. The depiction of marital strife and women's professional identification has also a strong moral message mitigated by authors's belief in universal salvation.|$|E

500|$|Tessa {{was born}} on August 28, 1958 in Lille, France. When she was seven years old, {{she fell in love}} {{for the first time with}} then-nineteen-year-old Alan Rothwood (Anthony Head). Tessa recalls in [...] "" [...] that she was [...] "heartbroken" [...] when he {{completed}} his studies and left the country.

500|$|Stacy goes {{to visit}} House again in [...] "Three Stories", {{five years after}} their break up. She has married Mark Warner (Currie Graham), a high school {{guidance}} counselor. Stacy believes Mark is ill, and wants House to treat him. However, Mark does not <b>believe</b> <b>anything</b> is wrong with him, {{as well as the}} members of House's diagnostic team, who cannot seem to find any medical problems. After various failed attempts to diagnose Mark, House tests Marks urine for porphobilinogen; the test turns out positive, and Mark is diagnosed with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). He is therefore required to have [...] "close monitoring" [...] at the hospital for a while. Stacy makes a deal with Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) to become the hospital's lawyer during Mark's stay at the hospital. During Stacy's time as the hospital's lawyer, she and House grow closer together. In [...] "Need to Know", they end up spending the night together. However, when Stacy prepares to leave Mark for House, House rejects her, stating that he cannot make her happy, because he cannot change. Stacy quits her job and returns to Short Hills, New Jersey, with Mark. She later appears in the series finale, [...] "Everybody Dies", first as one of House's hallucinations and then at House's funeral.|$|E

500|$|Brown was {{nominated}} in the Best Actress category at the 2009 British Academy Television Awards {{based on her}} performance in the episode, becoming the first soap actress nominated in the category since 1988, when Jean Alexander was shortlisted {{for her role as}} Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street. She commented that she was proud to be nominated, but was not overly excited as: [...] "I don't <b>believe</b> <b>anything</b> is going to happen until it does, until you see your name on a paper or it actually happens and you have something in your hand." [...] Brown lost out to Anna Maxwell Martin, but the show's executive producer, Diederick Santer, described the nomination as his proudest moment of 2009, saying: [...] "I'm not one to complain to the referee, but it's beyond me why she didn't win. Week in, week out, she turns out amazing performances. The audience knew it and we knew it. With the greatest respect to the actress who won, you could hear the audience in the Royal Festival Hall that night sigh with disappointment. It was a missed opportunity by BAFTA [...] to connect with a big audience." [...] McLean agreed that Brown deserved to win, but commented on the awards: [...] "never underestimate snobbery towards soap." [...] Brown spoke of the nomination in 2013, saying: [...] "You never [...] if you're in a soap. [...] I would've liked it, yes. I would've felt it had crowned my acting in a way, made it sound worthwhile, I think. So I didn't care that I didn't get nominated for any other awards that time!" ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{labeled the}} media's {{reaction}} to the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot and the measures taken to avoid havoc at the airports unnecessary since the suspects had already been caught. He argued that the media coverage was sensationalist and driven by profit considerations, and that the British government used the occasion to give an impression of success in the War on Terrorism. Pointing out that no explosives had been found, {{he wrote in a}} column headlined [...] "Don't <b>believe</b> <b>anything</b> written about al-Qaida" [...] that the reactions had resulted in a victimization of the Muslim community.|$|E
2500|$|Arguing {{that it was}} immoral {{to believe}} things for which one lacks evidence, his 1877 essay [...] "The Ethics of Belief" [...] {{contains}} the famous principle [...] "it is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to <b>believe</b> <b>anything</b> upon insufficient evidence." [...] As such, he was arguing in direct opposition to religious thinkers for whom [...] "blind faith" [...] (i.e. belief in things {{in spite of the}} lack of evidence for them) was a virtue. This paper was famously attacked by pragmatist philosopher William James in his [...] "Will to Believe" [...] lecture.

2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{thinking}} behind his {{change of name}} when he converted to Islam he stated that he was [...] "latching on to something {{that was part of}} my heritage, because many of the slaves who were brought here were Muslims.

My father found out about that when I was a kid, and it gave me all I needed to know that, hey, I was somebody, even if nobody else knew about it. When I was a kid, no one would <b>believe</b> <b>anything</b> positive that you could say about black people.

2500|$|Australian Major General Jim Molan (retired), {{who served}} as chief of {{operations}} of the Iraq multinational force in 2004–05, stated that [...] "The Goldstone report is an opinion by one group of people putting forward their judgments, with limited access to the facts, and reflecting their own prejudices. The difference in tone and attitude in the report when discussing Israeli and Hamas actions is surprising." ... "as a soldier who has run a war against an opponent not dissimilar to Hamas, facing problems perhaps similar to those faced by Israeli commanders, my sympathies tend to lie with the Israelis." ... "But having stated my prejudice, I think I may be more honest than Goldstone, who seems to pass off his prejudices in a report that cannot be based on fact, and uses judicial language and credibility to do so.

2500|$|World War II shocked {{her into}} a more {{conventional}} belief: [...] "I believe if {{people are looking for}} the truth, the truth of the Christian religion will come out and meet them." [...] And in the early 1950s, she thought she had a mystical revelation in France and actively tried to convert to Catholicism. There was a precedent in her family for this action, as her sister, Letitia, had earlier converted to Catholicism, thereby causing quite a stir. But West's attempt was short-lived, and she confessed to a friend: [...] "I could not go on with being a Catholic... I don't want, I can't bear to, become a Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, and I cannot believe that I am required to pay such a price for salvation." [...] Her writings of the 1960s and early 1970s again betray a profound mistrust towards God: [...] "The case against religion is the responsibility of God for the sufferings of mankind, which makes it impossible to believe the good things said about Him in the Bible, and consequently to <b>believe</b> <b>anything</b> it says about Him." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{far-reaching}} {{criticisms of}} U.S. {{foreign policy and}} the legitimacy of U.S. power have raised controversy. A document obtained pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from the U.S. government revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) monitored Chomsky's activities and for years denied doing so. The CIA also destroyed its files on Chomsky {{at some point in}} time, possibly in violation of federal law. He has often received undercover police protection at MIT and when speaking on the Middle East, although he has refused uniformed police protection. German newspaper Der Spiegel described him as [...] "the Ayatollah of anti-American hatred", while conservative commentator David Horowitz termed him [...] "the most devious, the most dishonest and... the most treacherous intellect in America", one whose work was infused with an [...] "anti-American dementia" [...] and which evidences Chomsky's [...] "pathological hatred of his own country".
