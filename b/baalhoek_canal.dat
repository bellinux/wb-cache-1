5000|$|Baalhoek {{is mostly}} {{associated}} with the [...] "Baalhoekkanaal" [...] (<b>Baalhoek</b> <b>Canal),</b> {{a plan for a}} shortcut to the harbour of Antwerp to bypass the narrows of Bath that was proposed in 1967, but finally rejected in 1998 due to the resistance of a coalition of environmentalists and farmers.|$|E

The main constituents are the Waasland Canal, the Verrebroek Dock, and the Vrasene Dock. The abandonment of the <b>Baalhoek</b> <b>Canal</b> project meant that an additional dock, known as the Doel Dock, would never be fitted out for shipping.|$|E
50|$|The first {{plans for}} the {{development}} of the Waaslandhaven on Antwerpâ€™s left bank were prepared in the boom years of the 1960s. At that time, it was hoped that agreement could be reached with the Dutch on the construction of the <b>Baalhoek</b> <b>Canal,</b> which would have run from Kallo in Belgium through the Drowned Land of Saefthinge (on Dutch territory) into the Western Scheldt. This grand concept had the advantage that it would cut off the difficult bend known as the Bocht van Bath and facilitate access to deep draught ships.|$|E
