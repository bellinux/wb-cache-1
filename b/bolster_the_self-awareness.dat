40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to clarify <b>the</b> <b>self-awareness</b> of ethnic {{identity}} of the third and forth generation Japanese-Brazilian youths who are living in Japan. The semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 young Japanese-Brazilian people with Japanese elementary and junior high school experience. The analysis results with regard to <b>the</b> <b>self-awareness</b> of <b>the</b> subjects’ current ethnic identity were classiﬁed into three categories: “Brazilian identity”, “Bicultural identity”, and “Japanese identity”. Next, the cases of the process for forming <b>the</b> <b>self-awareness</b> of ethnic identity were examined. Moreover, the following factors were considered: the inﬂuence of parent-child relationships, recognition of ethnic identity by others who know the subjects, the presence or absence of return experience to Brazil, return timing and self-determination to return on <b>the</b> <b>self-awareness</b> of ethnic identity. The following three points were revealed as factors to form <b>the</b> <b>self-awareness</b> of ethnic identity of Japanese-Brazilian youths. First, recognition of ethnic identity by others is important. Second, a good parent-child relationship has a positive effect on ethnic identity as Brazilian. Third, formation of <b>the</b> <b>self-awareness</b> of ethnic identity is associated with return timing and self-determination to return...|$|R
40|$|Special Issue: Conscious Thinking and Cognitive PhenomenologyIn this paper, I {{draw from}} Kantian and Husserlian {{reflections}} on <b>the</b> <b>self-awareness</b> of thinking for {{a contribution to}} the cognitive phenomenology debate. In particular, I draw from Kant’s conceptions of inner sense and apperception, and from Husserl’s notions of lived experience (Erlebnis) and self-awareness for an inquiry into the nature of our awareness of our own cognitive activity. With particular consideration of activities of attention, I develop what I take to be Kant’s and Husserl’s “agentive” and “proprietary” accounts. These, I believe, augment contemporary discussions in interesting ways and further <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> case for cognitive phenomenology. Moreover, the historical comparison highlights a number of assumptions made today that were not yet part of the framework at the time of Kant or at the time of Husserl. This helps reflect on the legitimacy of these assumptions. status: publishe...|$|R
