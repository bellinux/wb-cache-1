5|$|Affeldt's final {{start of}} the year came on July 23, in a game he won against Minnesota. After the start, the Royals moved him to the bullpen to try to fix his <b>blister</b> problems. The move was {{originally}} thought to be temporary. While in the bullpen, on August 3, he got his career first save in a 20 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. On August 21, the Royals announced that Affeldt would {{spend the rest of the}} year in the bullpen. Two days later, he got another save against Minnesota. He picked up two more saves before the end of the year and finished with a 76 record and a 3.93 ERA. After the season, to try to help with his <b>blister</b> problems, he had part of a fingernail on the middle finger of his left hand removed. Also, the Royals announced that if he developed <b>blister</b> problems again, he would be sent to the bullpen for good.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers have a {{wide range}} of predators at {{different}} stages of their lives; eggs are eaten by bee-flies, ground beetles and <b>blister</b> beetles; hoppers and adults are taken by other insects such as ants, robber flies and sphecid wasps, by spiders, and by many birds and small mammals.|$|E
5|$|Several cheeses may {{be mixed}} {{together}} in its formulation, {{and each has}} individual browning and blistering characteristics. For example, a combination of Mozzarella and Cheddar may <b>blister</b> less when cooked compared to other combinations, because cheddar has less elasticity, while Mozzarella and provolone may brown less compared to other combinations.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{report on}} the {{formation}} of <b>blisters</b> during the atomic layer deposition of iridium using iridium acetylacetonate and oxygen precursors. Films deposited on fused silica substrates led to sparsely distributed large <b>blisters</b> while {{in the case of}} silicon with native oxide additional small <b>blisters</b> with a high density was observed. It is found that the formation of <b>blisters</b> is favored by a higher deposition temperature and a larger layer thickness. Postdeposition annealing did not {{have a significant effect on}} the formation of <b>blisters.</b> Finally, changing purge duration during the film growth allowed us to avoid <b>blistering</b> and evidenced that impurities released from the film in gas phase were responsible for the formation of <b>blisters...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop novel {{techniques}} to investigate the <b>blistering</b> and browning properties of Mozzarella cheese. An innovative and holistic approach was developed to evaluate cheese <b>blistering</b> and browning properties using machine vision system and image analysis techniques. As a novel technique for the <b>blistering</b> evaluation, the number, size and shape of <b>blisters</b> were analyzed. The techniques were applied on a range of starter cultures and the <b>blistering</b> and browning properties were related to cheese composition (sugar, moisture, etc.) and functional properties (meltability, free oil, viscoelasticity, and stretching properties). As shown by the results, Mozzarella made with more heat sensitive starter cultures had the least intensive browning and the smallest number of <b>blisters.</b> Free oil was found to significantly affect <b>blistering</b> appearance by impeding the moisture loss from the cheese—fewer <b>blisters</b> were formed on Mozzarella cheese with more free oil...|$|R
40|$|Oblique {{injection}} of argon ions with energy of 1 keV was conducted for etching of polycrystalline copper. The surface became rough {{owing to the}} formation of <b>blisters.</b> The average diameter and height of <b>blisters</b> was approximately 150 and 20 – 30 nm, respectively. The polycrystalline copper irradiated by argon ions was annealed to rupture the <b>blisters.</b> The retained argon desorbed in the temperature range from 500 to 800 K. The height of <b>blisters</b> significantly reduced to 10 – 15 nm although the diameter and surface density of <b>blisters</b> roughly remained the same...|$|R
5|$|Whitebark pine {{communities}} have been heavily damaged {{due to the}} effects of <b>blister</b> rust, a non native fungus. In Glacier and the surrounding region, 30% of the whitebark pine trees have died and over 70% of the remaining trees are currently infected. The whitebark pine provides a high fat pine cone seed, commonly known as the pine nut, that is a favorite food of red squirrels and Clark's nutcracker. Both grizzlies and black bears are known to raid squirrel caches of pine nuts, one of the bears' favorite foods. Between 1930 and 1970, efforts to control the spread of <b>blister</b> rust were unsuccessful, and continued destruction of whitebark pines appears likely, with attendant negative impacts on dependent species.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list after only four games with <b>blister</b> problems again. His time on the DL was brief and he returned to the Royals on May 6. On May 28, he struck out a career high eight hitters in a win against the Minnesota Twins. Later, on June 6, he notched his first hit.|$|E
5|$|Crucible {{steel is}} steel {{that has been}} melted in a {{crucible}} rather than having been forged, {{with the result that}} it is more homogeneous. Most previous furnaces could not reach high enough temperatures to melt the steel. The early modern crucible steel industry resulted from the invention of Benjamin Huntsman in the 1740s. <b>Blister</b> steel (made as above) was melted in a crucible or in a furnace, and cast (usually) into ingots.|$|E
40|$|Autoimmune <b>blistering</b> {{diseases}} of the pemphigus group <b>Blisters</b> may appear in many dermatological diseases, {{but they are not}} necessarily of autoimmune etiology. For the study of <b>blistering</b> diseases, it is necessary {{to take into account the}} clinical aspects, the history of when and how <b>blisters</b> appeared, the epidemiological and histological information (for instance, the skin level at which <b>blisters</b> are located), and whether inflammatory infiltrates are present. In order to corroborate the autoimmune etiology of <b>blisters,</b> it is important to have the results of confirmatory tests such as direct and indirect immunofluorescence, immune blotting, enzyme-linked immune-assay (ELISA), immune precipitation, and electronic microscopy. Information on autoantibodies serum titers may help to conduct a more precise immunosuppressive therapy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAccelerated {{environmental}} (hygrothermal) exposure {{experiments are}} performed on organic paints coated on commercial die-cast AZ 91 D Mg alloys {{to investigate the}} effects of contamination on <b>blistering.</b> Specifically, artificial human perspiration spray is used to contaminate the substrate surface. <b>Blistering</b> occurred only for paints that are spread on surfaces with the perspiration present. More <b>blisters</b> gradually form at longer test times, and the volume of <b>blistering</b> increases. Scanning electron microscopy indicates that <b>blistering</b> is initiated by contamination and/or substrate corrosion at the interface of the organic paints and the substrate. <b>Blistering</b> is characterized for two samples exposed to the hygrothermal environments for various times, and {{is found to be}} initially empty in the early stages. Hydrophilic chloride contaminants from the perspiration lead to in situ adhesion loss. Simultaneously, the paints volume expands, and the associated compressive stress causes it to bulge. After long-term test exposure, chloride anions corrode the substrate under the films, and MgO, Mg(OH) 2, and Mg 2 (OH) 3 Cl corrosion products fill the <b>blisters.</b> Finally, a model of <b>blistering</b> evolution is discussed...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we analyse the <b>blistered</b> {{function}} in wing vein development by studying genetic mosaics of mutant cells, genetic interactions with other genes affecting vein development and <b>blistered</b> expression in several mutant backgrounds. <b>blistered</b> encodes {{for a nuclear}} protein homologous to the mammalian Serum Response Factor and is expressed in presumptive intervein cells of third larval instar and pupal wing discs. Clones of <b>blistered</b> mutant cells proliferate normally but tend to grow along veins and always differentiate as vein tissue. These observations indicate that vein-determined wing cells show a particular behaviour {{that is responsible for}} their allocation to vein regions. We observe strong genetic interactions between <b>blistered,</b> veinlet and genes of the Ras signaling cascade. During disc proliferation, <b>blistered</b> expression is {{under the control of the}} Ras signal transduction pathway, but its expression is independent of veinlet. During the pupal period, <b>blistered</b> and veinlet expression become interdependent and mutually exclusive. These results link the activity of the Ras pathway to the process of early determination of intervein cells, by the transcriptional control of the <b>blistered</b> nuclear factor. Peer reviewe...|$|R

5|$|Hemorrhagic {{smallpox}} is {{a severe}} form that {{is accompanied by}} extensive bleeding into the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. This form develops in approximately 2 percent of infections and occurred mostly in adults. In hemorrhagic smallpox the skin does not <b>blister,</b> but remains smooth. Instead, bleeding occurs under the skin, making it look charred and black, hence this form of the disease {{is also known as}} black pox.|$|E
5|$|If {{this were}} the case, Helble {{concluded}} that the United States should tell Diệm that his regime must condemn {{the actions of the}} troops and punish the culprits. If Diệm refused, the United States should threaten to publicly condemn and distance itself from Saigon. With the US also decrying the use of troops against civilian protests, the South Vietnamese government complained that unlike their Saigon counterparts, the Huế police were not trained in riot control. Diệm's authorities requested that the Americans airlift 350 military personnel from Vũng Tàu in the far south to quell the protests in Huế, but the Americans refused. William Trueheart, {{who was in charge of}} the US Embassy, Saigon while Ambassador Frederick Nolting was on holiday, confronted Secretary of State Nguyễn Đình Thuận about the allegations of <b>blister</b> gas usage the next day. Thuận appeared to be astounded and asked Trueheart what <b>blister</b> gas was. Trueheart explained that the symptoms of the victims were consistent with those of mustard gas and passed on the US threat to denounce the regime for the chemical attacks.|$|E
5000|$|During suction <b>blistering,</b> the lamina lucida of {{the skin}} is cleaved from the {{underlying}} layers. This separates the epidermis from the dermis. With the use of small vacuum pumps, little fluid-filled <b>blisters</b> are created, typically on the abdomen. <b>Blisters</b> are usually formed within 2 to 3 hours. A well-recognized instrument, the Negative Pressure Instrument, from Electronic Diversities, Finksburg MD, US, is used with heated chambers to produce various-sized suction <b>blisters</b> with less time and improved success.

40|$|Superficial wound <b>blisters</b> are an {{abnormal}} swelling (i. e. filling with fluid) in the epidermal {{layer of the}} skin in response to trauma [FIGUrE 1]. <b>Blistering</b> in postoperative wounds {{may be caused by}} skin stripping from removal of medical tape removal, or prolonged exposure of the skin to adhesive contact layers of dressings and associated with the presence of sutures. Deeper dermal <b>blisters</b> are generally associated with burns or direct trauma and can take longer to heal than superficial <b>blisters.</b> Postsurgical <b>blistering</b> can cause pain, wound leakage, delay healing of the wound, and increase the risk of postoperative surgical site infection, which ultimately can result in prolonged and costly hospital stays...|$|R
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} Scarygirl, {{a young girl}} with an eye patch, a sewn-shut mouth and a hook-capped tentacle for one arm. The girl, an orphan, was raised and cared for by <b>Blister,</b> an intelligent, mustached octopus that built the girl a tree house to live in. Plagued by recurring nightmares that featured a mysterious man, the girl consults Bunnyguru, a rabbit that lives {{in the bottom of}} the tree where the girl makes her home. Bunniguru offers a vision of a city far away from the girl's home. The girl is then sent by <b>Blister</b> into a forest to investigate why the Tree of Life is losing its leaves, where she discovers that one of the keepers of the forest has been kidnapped and taken to the city from Bunnyguru's vision, and becomes tasked with seeing to the keeper of the forest's safe return.|$|E

5|$|Affeldt's time in {{the bullpen}} did not last long. On May 3, he {{replaced}} Bryan Rekar in the Royals' starting rotation. In his first start, he pitched four innings, gave up one run, and earned a nodecision in a 43 loss to the Baltimore Orioles. Affeldt's time as a starter garnered so-so results, as he was 04 with a 5.45 ERA in seven starts. In his last start, on June 8, Affeldt picked up the loss as the Royals fell 113 to the St. Louis Cardinals.

40|$|The term {{pemphigus}} {{refers to}} a group of autoim-mune intraepidermal <b>blistering</b> diseases of the skin and mucous membranes (10). The acquired diseases of the pemphigus do not heal spontaneously and are primarily characterized by acantholysis within the epi-dermis leading to <b>blistering</b> (7). The term pemphigus, from the Greek pemphix meaning „bubble“, origina-ted with Hippocrates, who described a pemphigoid fever that was not characterized by <b>blisters</b> and thus probably did not represent pemphigus (12). In 1791 Wichmann gave the name pemphigus to a chronic <b>blistering</b> disease that corresponds to what is today recognized as pemphigus.
