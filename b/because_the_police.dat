5|$|Morrow {{ordered the}} {{motorcade}} {{to turn around}} at the Bridge Street intersection because he realised that they had proceeded further than expected, and <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> officers {{were not going to}} stop them. After partially turning the motorcade, Licciardello alighted onto the street and complained, in character as bin Laden, about not being invited to the APEC Summit. At this point, the police requested Morrow's identity. After inspecting his fake pass, officers realised that Morrow was from The Chaser and took all eleven members of the motorcade into custody. Surprisingly, as pointed out by the team on their television show, the officers initially ignored Licciardello (Osama Bin Laden) and only arrested Morrow.|$|E
5|$|The steel casket {{containing}} the gold is traced {{by the police}} allowing them to track down Diabolik's hideout. They close in on Diabolik, who is melting the gold and turning it into ingots. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> are shooting at him, Diabolik is unable to control the heating of the gold, and the whole cavern ends up being covered in molten gold. Again, Diabolik {{is believed to be}} dead, with his heat-proof suit now covered in solidified gold. The police seal off the cavern intending to recover the gold later. Eva is allowed to pay her respects to Diabolik, who winks at her.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the Supreme Court of India {{directed}} {{that the}} case be transferred from police investigation to a committee appointed by the court, the Special Investigation Team, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> {{had become one of}} the riot cases. The team was led by ex-Central Bureau of Investigation director R. K. Raghavan, and the case was the sixth Gujarat riots case assigned to them for investigation. Taking into account the findings about telephone records of various activists, Kodnani and other major leaders were included in the report for the first time. The Special Investigation Team's findings added 24 more names to the 46 people arrested by the police. Before the trial began, 6 of the accused died. In 2009 the trial started, during which three of the accused died, thus the final report covered 61 people.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} <b>the</b> Romanian Military <b>Police</b> is close {{related to the}} history of <b>the</b> Romanian Gendarmerie, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> provost <b>policing</b> was a task of the Gendarmerie since its inception.|$|R
50|$|The custom {{died out}} {{early in the}} 20th century, c.1909 (probably <b>because</b> <b>the</b> local <b>police</b> {{regarded}} it as begging), but it was resurrected by the Whittlesea Society in 1980.|$|R
50|$|Jorabagan is a {{neighbourhood}} {{in north}} Kolkata, earlier known as Calcutta, in the Indian state of West Bengal. As a neighbourhood, it covers {{a small area}} but its importance is primarily <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> station and <b>the</b> assembly constituency.|$|R
25|$|As {{the crowds}} were {{breaking}} up the next day, on 14 October, many students found themselves unable to leave <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> blocked the southern route to Rajavithi Road. Cornered and overwhelmed by the hostile crowd, the police responded with teargas and gunfire.|$|E
25|$|Hudson {{appealed to}} the Court of Appeals on the sole ground that the {{evidence}} seized during the execution of a search warrant should have been suppressed <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> violated the knock and announce statute. The court rejected his argument and affirmed his conviction. The Michigan Supreme Court again declined to review Hudson's case.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the huge}} volume of people who {{attended}} the Nambassa 3 day festival in 1979, the organizers were unable to get an accurate census of attendees, but have given estimates of 75,000 people. Some segments of the media, including Television New Zealand who were regularly flying over the festival, were quoting estimates as high as 150,000 people. This event became a free concert, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police,</b> unable to control the {{large volume of traffic}} which had closed all roads in a 20 kilometer radius, officially closed the event down mid-morning of the first day.|$|E
50|$|One {{criticism}} {{is that both}} the youth survey and the adult surveys do not distinguish between a) crimes not reported to <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>because</b> they thought <b>the</b> <b>police</b> would do nothing or b) crimes not reported to <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> victim thought them too trivial.|$|R
5000|$|It was very, very {{difficult}} to continue <b>because</b> <b>the</b> local <b>police</b> and all <b>the</b> towns had almost crushed us. They were closing in like… They murdered people, they beat people, arrest was about the least harmful thing to occur.|$|R
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> Aviation <b>Police</b> Office of Taiwan proved inept in {{handling}} the riot, its director, Chen Jui-tien was dismissed that evening. The Minister of the Interior Su Chia-chyuan offered to resign, but {{the offer was}} rejected by Premier Frank Hsieh.|$|R
25|$|Howard is {{abducted}} {{from his}} home planet and is dropped into the Florida Everglades by the demon Thog the Nether-Spawn, Overmaster {{of the realm of}} Sominus. He meets the Man-Thing, Korrek the Barbarian, Dakimh the Enchanter and Jennifer Kale, but falls off the inter-dimensional stepping stones. He materializes in Cleveland, Ohio and battles Garko the Man-Frog, for which he is arrested for disturbing the peace and mistaken for a mutant during a strip search. Released <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> fear he has mutant abilities, he encounters Bessie the Hellcow, a vampire cow.|$|E
25|$|On December 5, 2008, the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal {{held that}} her {{statements}} {{were taken in}} violation of her Miranda rights, but that the search of her car was still valid under the inevitable discovery exception to the search warrant requirement <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> would have inevitably {{found it in the}} normal course of the investigation despite her illegal statement. The case was sent back for trial. A pre-trial status hearing was scheduled for June 22, 2009. On April 1, 2009, the judge ordered Nowak to undergo two psychiatric evaluations before June 12, 2009.|$|E
25|$|Although {{still with}} the Illinois militia {{and not in the}} federal army, Colonel Tucker {{returned}} to command the camp on June 19, 1862. To deal with local civilian sympathizers who might be aiding escapes, Colonel Tucker declared martial law on July 12, 1862. When twenty–five prisoners escaped on July 23, 1862, Tucker arrested several citizens who he believed aided the escapees. In addition, he brought in Chicago police to search the camp. This action caused much lasting animosity from the prisoners <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> confiscated many of the prisoners' valuables. The police also confiscated five pistols and many bullets. Twenty of the escapees were recaptured within two weeks.|$|E
5000|$|The {{trial judge}} commented after the outcome that [...] The court has acquitted them <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Delhi <b>police</b> failed {{to sustain the}} grounds on which they had built up their case. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> failed to recover the weapon which was used to fire at Jessica Lal as well as prove their theory that the two cartridges, emptied shells of which were {{recovered}} from the spot, were fired from one weapon.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the story {{actually}} features only one female <b>police</b> officer, <b>the</b> film's title was pluralized and formed into one word <b>because</b> <b>the</b> title <b>Police</b> Woman was already in use by an NBC TV series whose pilot was scheduled to premiere one month after this film's release.|$|R
50|$|Early in 2011 the {{community}} around Milestone ROM-Development and the Polish National BOINC Team initiated AndrOINC {{to decipher the}} RSA 1024-bit signature and make customizing possible.

25|$|State media {{reported}} on 31 May that two ZANU-PF supporters {{had been killed}} by assailants believed to be MDC supporters. The MDC had planned to hold rallies in Hwange and Victoria Falls on the same day, but it was unable to do so <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> did not allow its supporters into the venues, according to Chamisa. He said that the police were obstructing the MDC on instructions from ZANU-PF. Eric Matinenga, the newly elected MDC MP for Buhera West, was arrested on 31 May for allegedly paying MDC supporters to attack war veterans; the MDC said that his arrest occurred when he went to visit MDC supporters who had already been arrested.|$|E
25|$|After causing {{another car}} {{accident}} between Mr. Meier {{and the white}} BMW, Lola arrives at the bank moments later; her delay due to her earlier injury allows her dad's mistress to explain he isn't the child's father. Lola hears them arguing. Infuriated, Lola leaves the bank but then comes back, takes the security guard's gun and robs the bank. A flash forward shows a banker she passes {{falling in love with}} a colleague. Lola escapes <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> mistake her for a fleeing hostage. Passing the ambulance, Lola asks for a ride, distracting the driver and causing the vehicle to hit the glass pane. Still late for the rendezvous with Manni by moments, Lola calls his name, only this time he hears her call. Manni walks towards Lola, only to be hit by the hastened ambulance, which fatally wounds him.|$|E
25|$|Hippie Hill {{has also}} been part of San Francisco’s history, namely the Summer of Love, which was a large {{counterculture}} movement that partially took part on the hill. During this Summer of Love, people gathered together to {{connect with one another}} in many ways, mainly dropping acid and playing music together. Music has its own history on the hill, with musicians and bands like Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and George Harrison playing music for free to the public. Improvised drum circles still form on the weekends where people come together and fill the park with a constant beat for hours on end. The hill played a major part in the hippies' ability to openly use drugs <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> had employed a policy of looking the other way {{when it came to the}} hill.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, Mann was {{an enemy}} alien, {{although}} he was not interned <b>because</b> <b>the</b> local <b>police</b> force refused to do so. In 1946, he was naturalized as a British subject. The same year, he returned to Germany {{as a member of}} the Legal Division of the Allied Control Council.|$|R
50|$|But then, while out hiking, she {{witnesses}} a murder. Reece is traumatized again, and {{not just}} by the killing, but also <b>because,</b> when <b>the</b> <b>police</b> go {{to check out the}} crime scene, there's no evidence of a murder taking place. The townspeople doubt her story due to her past, which leads everyone, including Reece, to question her sanity.|$|R
5000|$|Transferred {{with his}} unit to Oran, Carcassonne was demobilized on 28 August 1940 and sought immediately, {{with his brother}} Pierre Carcassonne, to go to England via Gibraltar. But this was in vain, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Vichy <b>police</b> and naval {{services}} guarded well and, the denouncement helping, more severe judgments rained down on those who were captured.|$|R
25|$|In mid 2008 {{after the}} {{indictment}} had been served, {{it was discovered}} that the main police investigator in the preliminary investigation had started working for one of the plaintiffs, Warner Brothers, before the date of the indictment. Sunde's lawyer Peter Althin questioned the neutrality and reliability of the preliminary investigation in the event that the investigator had entered the new employment during the investigation, and suspected the job might have been a reward for good work in The Pirate Bay investigation. Althin believed that the investigation might have to be redone if that was the case. The prosecutor Håkan Roswall responded that it wouldn't have posed problems for the investigation <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> were working under his directive, and the investigator's superior officer brushed off the incident as nothing remarkable. Warner Brothers commented merely that the investigator hadn't received any compensation during the time he worked for the Swedish police. According to Roswall, this type of concurrent employment would not be an individual incident, but that the decision of possible bias would be for the court to decide, and that the investigator is not a key witness in the case. The investigator could not be reached during the trial and was taken off the witness list.|$|E
500|$|After {{a federal}} agent from the Department of the Interior used a thermal imaging device to {{determine}} that Danny Lee Kyllo was using grow lamps to grow marijuana in his Florence, Oregon home, the Supreme Court of the United States determined {{that the use of}} a thermal imaging device from a public vantage point to monitor the radiation of heat from a person's home was a [...] "search" [...] within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and thus required a warrant. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> in this case did not have a warrant, the Court reversed Kyllo's conviction for growing marijuana.|$|E
500|$|United States v. Drayton, , {{was a case}} {{in which}} the United States Supreme Court {{clarified}} the applicability of Fourth Amendment protections to searches and seizures that occur on buses, as well as the function of consent during searches by law enforcement. During a scheduled stop in Tallahassee, Florida, police officers boarded a Greyhound bus [...] as part of a drug interdiction effort and interviewed passengers. After talking to two of the passengers and asking if they could [...] "check [...] person", officers discovered the two passengers had taped several packages of cocaine to their legs. At trial, the passengers argued that officers violated their Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> engaged in coercive behavior and never informed them that their participation in the drug interdiction efforts was voluntary.|$|E
50|$|Brussels {{has been}} on high alert since the November 2015 Paris attacks and the 2016 Brussels bombings. <b>The</b> Brussels <b>police</b> {{conducted}} major police operations in early 2016 against terrorism suspects. Salah Abdeslam and other suspects were arrested in these raids. <b>Because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> raids <b>the</b> Belgian crime rate has dropped but the illegal weapon trade, number of armed robberies and terrorism-related incidents in Brussels have significantly increased.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> Bulb is {{geographically}} unorganized and <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Albany <b>Police</b> Department {{had for a}} {{long period}} of time been given orders to not enforce the law barring [...] "camping", the Albany Bulb is often described as Anarchical. Many groups, including urban artists, otherwise-homeless Albany residents, dog walkers and owners, teenagers, and environmentalists, used the Bulb area and felt they have a stake in it.|$|R
2500|$|When Haig's forces {{began to}} advance towards the Hindenburg Line Wilson {{sent him a}} {{supposedly}} [...] "personal" [...] telegram (31 August), warning {{that he was not}} to take unnecessary losses in storming these fortifications (i.e. hinting that he might be sacked if he failed), later claiming that the government wanted to retain troops in <b>the</b> UK <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> strike.|$|R
500|$|After Garza {{confessed to}} police {{in a written}} {{statement}} on March 31, 1993, he was not arrested immediately because he agreed to cooperate with them in their efforts to apprehend Martínez. Garza reached out to Martínez and told her that the assassins wanted more money. He met with her three times in April 1993 wearing a wire, and had Martínez agree to contact Cisneros to give Garza the money. Police arrested Martínez on April 6 and agreed to work with them to incriminate Cisneros. The next morning, she scheduled a meeting with Cisneros and told her that the assassins requested more money, and she needed to pay. They rode around Brownsville and Cisneros's voice was recorded. The police kept close to the car to stay within the transmitter's signal range. Only portions of the conversation were recorded <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> were unable to remain within range all the time. While in the car, Cisneros gave Martínez an envelope with US$500. Cisneros then asked Martínez if there was any evidence that she had orchestrated the murder. Cisneros mentioned Garza and a man known as [...] "El Cortado," [...] though investigators had no idea who he was. In the recorded conversation, there was no incriminating evidence against the gunmen. since {{there was no evidence that}} Cisneros employed them, or that the assassins murdered Fischer. The meeting concluded when police pulled the vehicle over and arrested Cisneros. She told a police officer that she owed Martínez some money, which Martínez later admitted was not the case.|$|E
2500|$|They {{will attempt}} to intimidate you by sheer numbers and by brutality. Volunteers who may feel {{disappointed}} are entering the first dangerous threshold <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> will act upon this disappointment {{to the detriment of}} the volunteer and to the furtherment of their own ends. Volunteers must condition themselves that they can be arrested and if and when arrested they should expect the worse and be prepared for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Women Under Siege conducts {{detailed}} {{research and}} presents case studies on their website. They are currently attempting {{to quantify the}} number of sexual assaults {{that occurred during the}} Ukrainian conflict, but numbers are difficult to record <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> in the region [...] "strongly discourage women reporting rapes". Other projects include using data from the International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES) {{to address the issue of}} rape in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).|$|E
50|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> city <b>police</b> {{refused to}} interfere, {{businessmen}} hired private guards. The Chamber of Commerce {{called for a}} mass meeting to discuss {{ways of dealing with}} the violence, and for appealing to the city council to remove Mayor Duncan. But after receiving threats that anyone attending the meeting would be marked for violence, the Chamber called off the meeting.|$|R
5000|$|The head of {{the crime}} family mistakenly {{believes}} it was Coyle who informed on Scalisi and Van's gang. The boss, referred to only as [...] "the man," [...] is furious <b>because</b> <b>the</b> state <b>police</b> killed his friend, {{who was part of}} the gang, during the arrest. The man hires Dillon to kill Coyle, who begrudgingly takes the contract.|$|R
5000|$|A {{suspected}} felon barricaded himself {{inside of}} plaintiff Wegner's house. <b>The</b> Minneapolis <b>police</b> department fired tear gas canisters and concussion grenades {{into the house}} causing extensive damage. Wegner sued the defendant, the City of Minneapolis for trespass. Wegner claimed that the City's actions constituted a [...] "taking" [...] of his property under principles similar to those outlined in the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution: this was a taking of his private property for public use and so the City was required to compensate him for it. The City claimed there was no taking <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>police's</b> actions were a legitimate exercise of police power. Lower courts ruled that the City was justified under the doctrine of public necessity and that the City was not required to compensate Wegner. Wegner appealed to the State Supreme Court in its claim against the City's insurance company.|$|R
