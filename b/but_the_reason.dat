5|$|This first castle {{was used}} only briefly {{and seems to}} have been {{abandoned}} {{by the middle of the}} 12th century. The grain stores were destroyed by fire, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for this is uncertain. By this period, the town of Lydford as a whole was also in serious economic decline.|$|E
5|$|The {{behavior}} {{of matter and}} energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined physical laws. These laws have been employed to produce cosmological models that successfully explain the structure {{and the evolution of}} the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty physical constants that appear to be static across the observable universe. The values of these constants have been carefully measured, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for their specific values remains a mystery.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} from the Sun breaks water molecules apart, {{reducing the amount of}} water available to form noctilucent clouds. The radiation is known to vary cyclically with the solar cycle and satellites have been tracking the decrease in brightness of the clouds with the increase of ultraviolet radiation for the last two solar cycles. It has been found that changes in the clouds follow changes in the intensity of ultraviolet rays by about a year, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for this long lag is not yet known.|$|E

25|$|In {{any case}} {{the father was}} absent before Sequoyah was born. Various {{explanations}} have been proposed, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> is unknown. Wuteh did not remarry afterward (assuming she married her son's father in the first place). There were no siblings, and Sequoyah was raised by his mother alone. According to Davis, Sequoyah never went to school and never learned English. He and Wuteh spoke only Cherokee. As a youth, {{he spent much of}} his time tending cattle and working in their garden, while his mother ran a trading post.|$|E
25|$|Each nest is {{occupied}} by several adult females. When a larva matures in its cell, it lays down a layer of silk threads on the cell walls, then coats it with layers of a smooth and shiny substance, creating a sort of cocoon. The larva then defecates and smears its feces in vertical streaks {{on the inside of}} the cocoon to cover the lower half of the inner wall. This behavior is unique in E. imperialis, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for its behavior is still unknown. Males, after emerging from their cells, leave immediately and have been observed to never re-enter the nest.|$|E
50|$|Hart {{was told}} she would never menstruate nor have children, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> were not {{discussed}} and the topic was taboo. Initially, her parents refused to be filmed at all.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Åsmund was identical with the English clergyman Osmundus who became bishop at the court of king Emund <b>the</b> Old, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for this identification are not deemed sufficient.|$|R
50|$|Smoking, {{especially}} heavy smoking, is {{an important}} predisposing factor <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for this relationship are unknown. One hypothesis is that cigarette smoke contains nutritional factors for C. albicans, or that local epithelial alterations occur that facilitate colonization of candida species.|$|R
25|$|Heisenberg set Peierls a {{research}} project on ferromagnetism. It was known that this {{was caused by the}} spin of the electrons in the metal aligning; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for this was unknown. Heisenberg suspected that it was caused by a quantum mechanical effect, caused by the Pauli exclusion principle. Peierls was unable to develop the theory, but work on Hall effect was more productive. The anomalous Hall effect could not be explained with the classical theory of metals, and Heisenberg sensed an opportunity to demonstrate that quantum mechanics could explain it. Peierls was able to do so, resulting in his first published paper.|$|E
25|$|Early in the afternoon, the reunited {{squadron}} sighted a brig in Bridlington Bay, so {{at about}} 3:30pm, a small schooner, captured just the previous day, was sent with a 15-man boarding party. There is a discrepancy {{at this point}} between Jones’s official report and Bonhomme Richard’s log, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for sending the schooner may have been not because the brig was in very shallow water, but because the main squadron {{was on its way}} to investigate a sighting of a ship further north near Flamborough Head. Shortly after the schooner was dispatched, Alliance, which had been somewhat ahead of the others, hoisted a signal and set off at speed. At least two large vessels had been sighted in the distance, so the schooner was immediately recalled by firing a signal gun, and the entire squadron headed towards the potentially rich prizes.|$|E
25|$|Poirot {{is asked}} for {{assistance}} {{by a young}} lady, Diana Maberly. She was engaged to marry Hugh Chandler {{for over a year}} but he has broken it off as he thinks he is going mad. There is a history of insanity in the family, with his grandfather and a great aunt being afflicted, and his father, Admiral Chandler, has insisted his son leave the Navy before his condition gets worse <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> was hidden under the pretext of having to manage the family country estate – a reason no one believed, including Colonel Frobisher, a family friend and Hugh's godfather. At Poirot's prompting, Diana admits that there have been some unusual occurrences on nearby farms with the throats of sheep cut and the like but insists {{it has nothing to do}} with the situation. The Admiral refuses to let a doctor see his son.|$|E
50|$|Cochranella euknemos is {{generally}} threatened by deforestation in Panama, {{and east of}} the Panama Canal, chytridiomycosis. In Costa Rica it has declined {{and has not been}} seen since 1986, despite dedicated survey efforts, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for this decline are not currently known.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> main <b>reason</b> to {{vaccinate}} healthcare {{workers is}} to prevent staff from spreading flu to their patients and to reduce staff absence {{at a time of}} high service demand, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> healthcare workers state for their decisions to accept vaccination or not may more often be to do with perceived personal benefits.|$|R
25|$|At the Council of Nicaea, {{it became}} one of the duties of the patriarch of Alexandria to {{determine}} the dates of the Easter and to announce it to the other Christian churches. This duty fell on this officiate because of the erudition at Alexandria he could draw on. The rules to determine this are complex, but Easter is the first Sunday after a full moon occurring after the northern vernal equinox, which falls on or after 21 March, which was its nominal date {{at the time of the}} First Council of Nicaea. Shortly after Julius Caesar reformed the calendar, the northern vernal equinox was occurring on the nominal date of 25 March. This was abandoned shortly after Nicaea, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for the observed discrepancy was all but ignored (the actual tropical year is not quite equal to the Julian year of 365 days, so the date of the equinox keeps creeping back in the Julian calendar).|$|E
25|$|The Hill {{also has}} gone <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> {{for that is}} a little harder to pin. Up until the 1990s the Hill was a grassy slope without seating. It was the 'outer ground' costing the least to get in and {{attracting}} working class patronage. The invention of the beer can and the portable cooler in the 1960s increased alcohol consumption at cricket matches which in turn fuelled bad crowd behaviour. In the 1970s the advent of limited overs games held partially at night attracted a different kind of crowd to cricket at the SCG. They were less interested in the subtleties of the game and more in the excitement and spectacle. Brawling and excessive drinking were features of the crowd on the Hill at this time. Even the introduction of individual seating on the Hill failed to completely eradicate crowd misbehaviour. Stricter measures such as banning alcohol were later implemented with greater success.|$|E
500|$|The {{water on}} North Carolina's shores have risen [...] <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> is heavily discussed. Temperatures in North Carolina have risen too. Over the last 100 years, the average {{temperature}} in Chapel Hill {{has gone up}} 1.2°F (0.7°C) and precipitation {{in some parts of}} the state has increased by 5 percent.|$|E
50|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for <b>the</b> {{conflict}} between Berke and Hulagu {{was not only}} religion. It was territory. Möngke Khan gave Azerbaijan, which {{had been given to}} Jochi by Genghis Khan, to his brother Hulagu. Although Berke did not like the situation, he was patient till Möngke's death.|$|R

500|$|In an {{interview}} with John Norris of MTV News, Cox said of the reception to Let the Blind Lead: [...] "The response to this Atlas Sound record…the general response was very, very positive, but very, very much rooted in the concept {{that this is an}} emotional album. [...] This is an album {{that has a lot of}} feeling behind it, and it's very naked…That might in fact be , <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> it is that way is because it was done stream-of-consciously. [...] I'm not calculated. [...] I don't mind sentimentality, as long as it's not calculated." ...|$|E
500|$|Polish {{secret police}} (Służba Bezpieczeństwa) made a routine {{investigation}} that ended quickly {{due to the}} [...] "death of the culprit", followed by routine low-key surveillance {{of his friends and}} family, during which it intercepted Siwiec's last letter to his wife (delivered decades later). Overall, the authorities had little trouble suppressing the events, as none of the relatively few witnesses have shown any particular desire to make the event more widely known. There was some gossip about the incident, with most people considering it a suicide rather than an accident, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for it was unclear, and no one connected Siwiec's dramatic actions to contemporary political events. As publicist Stefan Kisielewski wrote in his diary two days after Siwiec's death, [...] "There are rumours about a self-immolation [...] but none knows the reason for it." ...|$|E
500|$|The Rodrigues rail (Erythromachus leguati), {{also known}} as Leguat's gelinote, Leguat's rail, or grey rail, is an extinct species of the rail family that was endemic to the Mascarene island of Rodrigues, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. It has {{sometimes}} been assigned to the genus Aphanapteryx, along with its close relative the red rail (A. bonasia) of Mauritius, but is generally kept in its own genus, Erythromachus. Their relationship with other rails is unclear. The Rodrigues rail was described as having grey plumage, a red beak, red legs, and a naked red patch around the eye. The beak varied between specimens from straight to curved, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for this is unknown. It was flightless and fed on tortoise eggs. It was described as being attracted to red objects, which humans exploited while hunting it.|$|E

500|$|Shearsmith {{said that}} he and Pemberton {{sometimes}} aim to produce episodes with genuinely scary scenes, comparing [...] "Séance Time" [...] to [...] "The Harrowing", the sixth episode of Inside No. 9 first series, which was also particularly horrific. He said that the writers and crew had similar aims in terms of atmosphere in [...] "Séance Time" [...] as they had in [...] "The Harrowing". The episodes also shared similar openings, with a lone woman walking towards a large house. Thematically, Shearsmith felt that the episode served to tie together a number of ideas with which he had been [...] "obsessed" [...] for years, including horror, ghosts and magic. The episode's director, Dan Zeff, got behind the idea of genuine horror, and Shearsmith was happy with how the initial séance was portrayed. A large number of horror clichés were used, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that these clichés are present is subsequently revealed.|$|E
500|$|On 22 August 634, Abu Bakr died, {{having made}} Umar, Khalid's cousin, his successor. Umar's first move was to relieve Khalid from supreme command of Muslim Forces and appoint Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah {{as the new}} {{commander}} in chief of the Islamic army. Khalid had become a trial of disbelief (because of his undefeated wars) for the Muslims as they had attributed the wins of battles to the personality and figure of Khalid; Umar was reported as saying:"I did not fire Khalid ibn al Waleed because I am angry with him or because of betrayal of trust or responsibility <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> was just that I wanted people to know that it is Allah who gives victory". This resulted in the dismissal of Khalid from supreme command and later in 638, from military services. Khalid, gave a pledge of loyalty to the new caliph and continued service as an ordinary commander under Abu Ubaidah. He is reported to have said: ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle called it his favorite {{episode of the}} show. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that [...] "it's nice to see [...] and Lisa getting along so well for once." [...] Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 5/5 rating and commented that [...] "any football fan will love this episode, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> {{why it is so}} good is the relationship between Homer and Lisa. The two truly are a father and daughter to one another, causing both laughter and touching emotion in the audience." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said [...] "Lisa the Greek" [...] is [...] "a chance for Homer and Lisa to bond under less than ideal, but always amusing, circumstances. Oddly, for a show relying on actual events like the Super Bowl to guide its plotline, it doesn't have [...] retread feeling.|$|E

50|$|During the Age of Enlightenment, {{belief in}} the powers of witches and sorcerers to harm began to die out in <b>the</b> West. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for disbelief {{differed}} from those of early Christians.
