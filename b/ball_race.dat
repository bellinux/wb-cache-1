50|$|These {{bearings}} {{make use}} of both ceramic <b>balls</b> and <b>race.</b> These bearings are impervious to corrosion and rarely require lubrication if at all. Due to the stiffness and hardness of the <b>balls</b> and <b>race</b> these bearings are noisy at high speeds. The stiffness of the ceramic makes these bearings brittle and liable to crack under load or impact. Because both <b>ball</b> and <b>race</b> are of similar hardness wear can lead to chipping at high speeds of both the <b>balls</b> and the <b>race</b> this can cause sparking.|$|R

2500|$|Lansdale {{is home to}} a Kugel ball, {{which is}} a dark grey granite sphere {{supported}} by a very thin film of water pumped from beneath its base. The Kugel Ball is located in Railroad Plaza, adjacent to the SEPTA Lansdale/Doylestown Line train station in downtown Lansdale. [...] The plaza consists of a bricked patio with benches centered on the Kugel Ball and closes at 11:00 pm. An annual 5k race is held in June, accordingly named the Kugel <b>Ball</b> <b>race,</b> which starts and ends at the actual Kugel Ball in Railroad Plaza.|$|E
2500|$|Increases in bore {{and stroke}} gave the D.4 {{more than twice the}} swept volume of the C.4 and roughly doubled its power. The cast-steel cylinders, {{individually}} machined inside and out, were mounted separately onto a flat-sided aluminium crankcase. They were fastened down by long bolts between them, which reached into the crankcase to support the four inner crankshaft bearings. The main bearings were in the crankcase ends, and the <b>ball</b> <b>race</b> was designed to allow either pusher or tractor operation. A flywheel was fitted to the output shaft. Thin cylindrical copper water jackets surrounded the cylinders almost to their base, where a rubber ring, located by a circumferential groove in the cylinder, provided a sliding water seal that allowed for the differential thermal contraction of copper and steel. [...] Cooling water was fed to these jackets by an engine-driven pump via a horizontal tube on the low right side of the engine, assuming a tractor orientation, and fed to the radiator by another tube on the top left.|$|E

50|$|A {{particularly}} common kind of {{rolling-element bearing}} is the ball bearing. The bearing has {{inner and outer}} <b>races</b> between which <b>balls</b> roll. Each <b>race</b> features a groove usually shaped so the ball fits slightly loose. Thus, in principle, the <b>ball</b> contacts each <b>race</b> across a very narrow area. However, a load on an infinitely small point would cause infinitely high contact pressure. In practice, the ball deforms (flattens) slightly where it contacts each race much as a tire flattens where it contacts the road. The race also yields slightly where each ball presses against it. Thus, the contact between <b>ball</b> and <b>race</b> is of finite size and has finite pressure. Note also that the deformed <b>ball</b> and <b>race</b> do not roll entirely smoothly because {{different parts of the}} ball are moving at different speeds as it rolls. Thus, there are opposing forces and sliding motions at each ball/race contact. Overall, these cause bearing drag.|$|R
2500|$|The 40-caliber barrel was {{constructed}} of twelve parts, notably the inner tube and various {{inner and outer}} jacket pieces. The hydro-pneumatic recoil system was mounted on the cradle above the gun. It used the same horizontal sliding block breech as the 38 cm Belagerungshaubitze M 16. The gun carriage rested on a base box or bedding platform which measured [...] long, [...] wide and [...] high. The base box incorporated a turntable resting on a <b>ball</b> <b>race</b> capable of 360° traverse. At {{the rear of the}} turntable was a [...] tilting crane used to move ammunition from the shell cart to the roller race and to help assemble the roller race and to remove the breech. The roller race was mounted directly behind the gun on four tilting arms. When the gun returned to the prescribed loading angle of 6° the roller race was raised so that it met the rear end of the breech, a shell was placed on roller race by the crane and it was hand-rammed with the shell sliding forward on the rollers. It was followed by a cartridge case containing the propellant. While the gun was being elevated to its firing angles between +10° and +41° 30' the roller race was lowered out of the recoil path of the gun.|$|E
2500|$|The types A, C, D and F {{were all}} side-valve engines, with valves {{operated}} by push rods running exposed and {{parallel to the}} cylinder axes, driven within the V from a central, gear-driven camshaft above the crankshaft. [...] All camshafts were hollow for lubrication. [...] The cylinder cooling jackets surrounded the cylinders, then turned inward with flattened faces for inlet and exhaust manifolds and push rods. [...] The exhaust stubs were vertical, each bank of cylinders feeding its own horizontal pipe. The inlet stubs entered the cylinder head at right angles. The earliest type A engines {{had a pair of}} inlet tubes, one for each bank and fed from a carburettor at the front. [...] Slightly later model As and types C and F placed the carburettor between the cylinder banks, halfway along the engine axis. [...] Fuel and air was passed to a spherical copper mixing chamber above the carburettor, then via four radial copper tubes which finally branched into pairs the feed the inlet ports symmetrically. [...] The smaller type D retained the end positioned carburettor. [...] These engines all had cast iron cylinders. The types A and C were very similar in construction as well as capacity, but a major change in crankshaft design was introduced with the smaller type D and inherited by the F. [...] The A and C types had a crankshaft supported by only three plain bearings and the width of the central one required a greater space between the second and third cylinder of each bank, visibly dividing each into blocks of two. [...] The crankshafts of the D and F types had five <b>ball</b> <b>race</b> bearings, one between each cylinder and two end bearings; the output thrust bearing was a double race to allow for pusher or tractor configurations. [...] The new bearing arrangement permitted an equal cylinder spacing. [...] The type FA was a type F with an extended crankshaft, mounted in a very prominent, conical crankcase extension. [...] The type T, discussed below, had a similar extension, which in that case at least allowed a larger diameter thrust bearing to be used.|$|E

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to develop replacement bearings for the Rocketdyne Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) high pressure oxidizer turbopumps (HPOTPs). The replacement bearings consisted of standard <b>balls</b> and <b>races</b> with a special Battelle Self-Lubricating Insert Configuration (BASIC) retainer. The BASIC retainer consists of a phosphor bronze housing with inserts consisting of a polytetrafluoretheylene (PTFE) and bronze compound. The PTFE contacts the balls and the land guiding surface on the outer race. A PTFE transfer film is formed on <b>balls</b> and <b>races,</b> which lubricates the critical interfaces. The BASIC retainer is a one-to-one replacement for the current Armalon retainer, but has superior lubricating properties and is stronger over the broad temperature range anticipated for the HPOTP bearings. As {{a part of the}} project 40 sets of <b>balls</b> and <b>races</b> (two sizes) and 52 BASIC retainers were shipped to NASA/MSFC...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the case}} of ball bearings, the bearing has inner and outer races {{and a set of}} <b>balls.</b> Each <b>race</b> is a ring with a groove where the balls rest. The groove is usually shaped so the ball is a {{slightly}} loose fit in the groove. Thus, in principle, the <b>ball</b> contacts each <b>race</b> at a single point. However, a load on an infinitely small point would cause infinitely high contact pressure. In practice, the ball deforms (flattens) slightly where it contacts each race, much as a tire flattens where it touches the road. The race also dents slightly where each ball presses on it. Thus, the contact between <b>ball</b> and <b>race</b> is of finite size and has finite pressure. Note also that the deformed <b>ball</b> and <b>race</b> do not roll entirely smoothly because different parts of the ball are moving at different speeds as it rolls. Thus, there are opposing forces and sliding motions at each ball/race contact. Overall, these cause bearing drag. [...] "V" [...] groove raceways distribute the load evenly over the balls as they travel on four points of contact, creating a straight line rolling effect and decreasing the amount of friction created by a full contact round groove design.|$|R
40|$|The {{press fitting}} of rolling bearings, the {{centrifugal}} {{expansion of the}} spindle and inner ring, and the thermal expansion of rolling bearing assembly elements modify the <b>ball</b> and <b>races</b> clearance, creating the hoop-stress. Consequently, the rolling elements and races contact loads and contact angles change. At high speed, beside the centrifugal forces acting on the rolling elements, the gyroscopic moment must be considered. The error introduced by neglecting the hoop-stress and the gyroscopic moment acting on balls in the computing of <b>ball</b> and <b>races</b> contact angles and contact loads is estimated for a steel {{angular contact ball bearing}} from 7206 C series...|$|R
