5|$|Cadmium is a soft, malleable, ductile, bluish-white {{divalent}} metal. It {{is similar}} in many respects to zinc but forms complex compounds. Unlike most other metals, cadmium is resistant to corrosion and {{is used as a}} protective plate on other metals. As a bulk metal, cadmium is insoluble in water and is not flammable; however, in its powdered form it may <b>burn</b> <b>and</b> release toxic fumes.|$|E
50|$|The George <b>Burns</b> <b>and</b> Gracie Allen Show, {{sometimes}} called The <b>Burns</b> <b>and</b> Allen Show, is a half-hour television series broadcast from 1950 to 1958 on CBS.

5|$|Construction of the {{original}} spacecraft was completed in August 2004. Following testing, the spacecraft was shipped to the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia during August 2005 and arrived on 1 September. The launch occurred from Site 133/3 on 8 October, however due to a missing command in the rocket's flight control system, the second stage engine did not shut {{down at the end}} of its planned <b>burn,</b> <b>and</b> instead the stage burned to depletion. This prevented the second stage and Briz-KM from separating, and as a result the rocket failed to achieve orbit. The spacecraft was lost when it reentered over the Arctic Ocean, north of Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Dunbeth hill {{where the}} present local {{authority}} municipal buildings stand is {{a wedge of}} rock which was probably squeezed upwards {{by the force of}} two (now-extinct) fault lines.

5|$|Following Thermopylae, the Persian {{army had}} {{proceeded}} to <b>burn</b> <b>and</b> sack the Boeotian cities {{which had not}} surrendered, Plataea and Thespiae, before taking possession of the now-evacuated city of Athens. The allied army, meanwhile, prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth. Xerxes wished for a final crushing defeat of the Allies to finish the conquest of Greece in that campaigning season; conversely the allies sought a decisive victory over the Persian navy that would guarantee {{the security of the}} Peloponnese. The ensuing naval Battle of Salamis ended in a decisive victory for the Allies, marking {{a turning point in the}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|Gray {{was born}} in Sauquoit, New York, on November 18, 1810, to Moses Gray (b.February26, 1786), then a tanner, and Roxanna Howard Gray (b. March 15, 1789). Born {{in the back of}} his father's tannery, Gray was the eldest of their eight children. Gray's {{paternal}} great-grandfather had arrived in Boston from Northern Ireland in 1718; Gray's Scotch-Irish Presbyterian ancestors had moved to New York from Massachusetts and Vermont after Shays' Rebellion. His parents married on July30, 1809. Tanneries needed a lot of wood to <b>burn,</b> <b>and</b> the lumber supply in the area had been shrinking, so Gray's father used his profits to buy farms in the area, and in about 1823 sold the tannery and became a farmer.|$|E

5|$|Injuries to the {{external}} ear occur fairly frequently, and can leave minor to major deformity. Injuries include: laceration, avulsion injuries, <b>burn</b> <b>and</b> repeated twisting or pulling of an ear, for discipline or torture. Chronic damage to the ears can cause cauliflower ear, a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the perichondrium, which can impair blood supply and healing. Owing to its exposed position, {{the external}} ear is susceptible to frostbite as well as skin cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinomas.|$|E
5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to <b>burn</b> <b>and</b> accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E
5|$|Eastern Air Lines {{operated}} {{the first commercial}} 757 flight on January 1, 1983, on the Atlanta-to-Tampa route. On February 9, 1983, British Airways began using the aircraft for London-to-Belfast shuttle services, where it replaced Hawker Siddeley Trident 3B trijets. Charter carriers Monarch Airlines and Air Europe also began 757 operations later that year. Early operators noted improved reliability and quieter performance compared with previous jetliners. Transition courses eased pilots' introduction to the new CRT-based cockpit, and no major technical issues arose. Eastern Air Lines, the first 727 operator to take delivery of 757s, confirmed that the aircraft had greater payload capability than its predecessor, along with lower operating costs through improved fuel <b>burn</b> <b>and</b> {{the use of a}} two-crew member flight deck. Compared with the 707 and 727, the new twinjet consumed 42 and 40percent less fuel per seat, respectively, on typical medium-haul flights.|$|E
40|$|Using camera trapping, I {{investigated}} carnivore {{occurrence in}} a high severity burn for four years in mixed conifer forests in the San Bernardino Mountains of southern California, USA. The objectives {{of this study were}} to catalog carnivores present in <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> unburned forests and, employing negative binomial regression analysis, to compare visitation of the <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> unburned forests by three carnivores: Lynx rufus, Canis latrans and Urocyon cinereoargenteus. In the summer of 2008, I placed 12 cameras along roads in a 9 km 2 area that burned in a stand-replacing wildfire and another 12 cameras in an adjacent unburned area of similar size. Ten mammalian carnivores were photo-captured in 2976 camera days; all the species were captured in the <b>burn</b> area <b>and</b> seven in unburned area. Lynx rufus was equally frequent in the <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> unburned forests. Canis latrans was more prevalent in unburned than <b>burned</b> forests <b>and</b> Urocyon cinereoargenteus preferred the <b>burn</b> area <b>and</b> was highly nocturnal in <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> unburned forests...|$|R

5|$|The {{computer}} console {{explosion that}} causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using brillo pads. Weldon hid steel wool inside the console and attached an arc welder to operate by remote control when the actor pulled a wire. The welder was designed to create a spark instead of actually welding, causing the steel wool to <b>burn</b> <b>and</b> make sparks; so effective was the setup that the cast members were continually startled by the flare-ups, resulting in additional takes. Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by Anti-gravity throughout the film. These effects were executed by several of Weldon's assistants. The crew built a circular track that had the same shape as the corridor and suspended the antigravity prop on four small wires that connected to the track. The wires were treated with a special acid which oxidized the metal; the reaction tarnished the wires to a dull gray that would not {{show up in the}} deep blue corridor lighting. Cargo boxes were made out of light balsa wood so that fine wires could be used as support.|$|E
5|$|Banksia speciosa is serotinous, that is, it has {{an aerial}} seed bank in its canopy {{in the form of}} the follicles of the old flower spikes. These are opened by fire and release seed in large numbers, which {{germinate}} and grow after rain. Seed can last for many years; old spikes 11 to 12 years old have been found to have 50% viable seed. Flower spikes appear to have similar numbers of follicles regardless of the age of the parent plant. Young plants begin flowering three years after regenerating from bushfire and store progressively larger numbers of old flowerheads (and hence seed) in the canopy. In one study, decade-old plants averaged around 3.5 old cones, whereas 21-year-old plants had 105, and were calculated as having over 900 viable seeds per plant. Plants appear to have a life span of at least 40 years, as healthy and vigorous individuals of this age are known. An experimental <b>burn</b> <b>and</b> monitoring of resultant seedling germination and growth showed B.speciosa seeds, though numerous, had poor rates of establishment but that seedlings were able to access water more easily and had higher rates of survival after two years than co-occurring Banksia species. Though this suggested B.speciosa might outcompete its conspecifics, the authors of the study noted that there could be other factors not accounted for in its natural environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{habitat in}} the valleys of the Cong <b>Burn,</b> <b>and</b> its {{tributary}} Little <b>Burn,</b> <b>and</b> the South Burn, is broadleaved woodland. The principal species are sessile oak, Quercus petraea, birch, Betula pubescens and hazel, Corylus avellana, with alder, Alnus glutinosa, locally dominant along the watercourses and at spring-lines. The understorey includes species such as wavy hair-grass, Deschampsia flexuosa, common bracken, Pteridium aquilinum, broad buckler fern, Dryopteris dilatata, and rowan, Sorbus aucuparia.|$|E
