Since the mid-1970s, when the foreign-domestic-helper policy was initiated, the number of workers has increased to around 300,000. At the end of 2013, there was an average of one foreign domestic worker for every eight households overall; in households with children, the average is one for every three. Foreign domestic helpers are about 10 percent of the working population. In December 2014 the number of migrant workers employed as helpers was over 330,000, 4.6 percent of the total population; the vast majority were female.|$|E

By that time they had also received three Logie Television Awards for Most Outstanding Children's Program. Foley stated that Hi-5 set a <b>benchmark</b> <b>for</b> a new style of non-traditional children's entertainment.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some {{within the field of}} attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors. The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. Resilience is a common and normal human characteristic. RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in foster children, adoptive children, or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a <b>benchmark</b> <b>for</b> estimates of RAD.|$|E

The importance of this <b>benchmark</b> <b>for</b> detecting irregularities in prices was first demonstrated in a Europe-wide study which investigated consumer price digits {{before and after the}} euro introduction for price adjustments.
