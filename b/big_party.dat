Inspector Madhukar Zende of the Mumbai police apprehended Sobhraj in O'Coquero Restaurant in Goa; his prison term was prolonged by ten years, just as he had hoped. On 17 February 1997, 52-year-old Sobhraj was released with most warrants, evidence and even witnesses against him long lost. Without any country to extradite him to, Indian authorities let him return to France.|$|E

500|$|To {{promote the}} album, Madonna {{embarked}} on The MDNA Tour, which was her ninth concert tour. The tour visited America, Europe and the Middle East, while also marking the singer's first {{performances in the}} United Arab Emirates, Ukraine, Scotland and Colombia. Described by her as [...] "the journey of a soul from darkness to light", The MDNA Tour was divided into four sections: Transgression, where guns and violence was the main theme, Prophecy, where a mix of joyful songs that bring people together are performed, Masculine/Feminine, a combination of sensuality and fashion {{with a few of}} Madonna's classic songs performed in a French Cabaret-style, and Redemption, which Madonna labelled as [...] "a <b>big</b> <b>party</b> and celebration". The tour received positive reviews, but courted many controversial subjects such as violence, firearms, human rights, nudity and politics. Nevertheless, it was a commercial success and many venues were instantly sold out. After completion, it was dubbed the highest-grossing tour of 2012 by Billboard. Total gross was $305.2million from 88 sold-out shows, becoming the tenth highest-grossing tour of all time and surpassing Celine Dion's Taking Chances World Tour as the second highest-grossing tour among female artists, behind Madonna's own Sticky & Sweet Tour.|$|E
500|$|Ever {{since its}} foundation, other parties have {{consistently}} refused the Progress Party's efforts to join any governing coalition {{at the state}} level. The reasons have mainly included concerns about the party's alleged irresponsibility and its position on immigration issues. Following the increased support and importance of the Progress Party in the 2005 elections, the Conservative Party stated {{they wanted to be}} [...] "a bridge between the Progress Party and the centre." [...] This is because the centrist Liberal Party and Christian Democratic Party reject the possibility of participating in a government coalition together with the Progress Party. In addition, the Progress Party does not want to support a government coalition that it itself is not a part of. In 2010, the Conservative Party went even further when its leader Erna Solberg stated that the Progress Party was now such a <b>big</b> <b>party</b> that it [...] "must" [...] be part of any centre-right governmental negotiations after the 2013 elections. At the municipal level, the Progress Party however cooperates with most parties, including the Labour Party. In 2007 it also attracted some unusual attention when the local Porsgrunn Progress Party was involved in some limited cooperation with the Socialist Left Party and the Red Party.|$|E

2500|$|This band dynamic {{has played}} a role in their public image as well. Early in their career, the duo were {{frequently}} accused of lacking stage presence, said to be a deliberate reaction to the hyper-cheerful music of the time, demonstrated by bands such as Wham!. A typical early performance featured Lowe in the background playing the bassline on a Fairlight synthesiser keyboard and Tennant singing, but otherwise passive, in the foreground. Tennant and Lowe both became well known for standing still throughout performances. In a 2016 interview, Chris Lowe said the duo's live performances was a response to the music scene in the 1980s: [...] "Everyone was so active. It was a <b>big</b> <b>party</b> where everyone was having a great time and smiling at the camera. Thumbs aloft! We just didn’t want to do that.

2500|$|The Breckenridge Heritage Alliance {{reports that}} in the 1930s, a women's group in Breckenridge {{stumbled}} upon an 1880s map that failed to include Breckenridge. They speculated that Breckenridge had never been officially annexed into the United States, and was thus still considered [...] "No Man's Land". This was completely false—official US maps did include Breckenridge—but these women created an incredibly clever marketing campaign out of this one map. In 1936 they invited the Governor of Colorado to Breckenridge to raise a flag at the Courthouse officially welcoming Breckenridge into the union—and he came. There was a <b>big</b> <b>party,</b> and the entire event/idea of Breckenridge being left off the map made national news. The [...] "No Man's Land" [...] idea later morphed into a new theme of Breckenridge being referred to as [...] "Colorado's Kingdom", and {{the theme of the}} town's independent spirit is still celebrated to today during the annual [...] "Kingdom Days" [...] celebrations every June.|$|E
2500|$|Trey Parker and Matt Stone {{described}} the episode {{as being a}} [...] "last minute" [...] one; {{even though they had}} several ideas for episodes, they wanted to quickly come up with an idea for an episode that featured Halloween because the episode would be airing close to Halloween. The idea of having Satan throw a <b>big</b> <b>party</b> on Earth was what the episode was produced around, and it wasn't until later in the production that the idea to parody the television series My Super Sweet 16 was implemented. Parker and Stone chose to parody that series because they felt that it was the [...] "most disgusting, foul show ever made", describing the people featured on it as [...] "evil" [...] and [...] "horrible". Originally, the episode opened with the scene where the boys are in the bathroom, rather than the scene in Hell. Parker decided to have the scenes switched at the last minute, and felt that it was a bad idea in hindsight.|$|E

It {{was the first time}} I had to deal with this kind of thing. But I have an eye and I learned from these tests." [...] At the Biltmore Hotel, a peculiar situation arose where the ceilings were simply too tall for standard lighting equipment. An ingenious idea was devised by the crew to have six to eight weather balloons sent up and have artificial light bounce off of them to create the proper lighting mood. Greenberg remarked, [...] "I wanted a very rich look from that place, gold and very warm. In the story it is very late after a <b>big</b> <b>party.</b> I wasn't going for any special effect, just nice light from lamps on the tables. The problem was, the hotel management wouldn't let us hang anything from the ceiling. In pre-production they had told us we could hang lights, but I didn't believe them. The ceilings there are very high and very beautiful." ...|$|E

[...] An amendment to the Volstead Act allowing the sale of beer went into effect in April 1933. [...] The availability of beer had a noticeable impact in Ann Arbor on football Saturdays.

[...] After the Ohio State game, the university attracted unwanted national publicity when its board in control of athletics mailed notices to ticket holders warning that they would be ejected if complaints were received about their drinking. [...] The notices stated that the board was not concerned with [...] "the personal habits and tastes" [...] of ticket-holders, but felt a deep concern [...] "when indulgence in such habits and tastes results in conduct disgusting or offensive to other patrons." ...|$|E
