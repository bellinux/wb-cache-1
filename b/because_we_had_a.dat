500|$|Filming for the {{television}} pilot began {{on location in}} Los Angeles in February 1999 and took six weeks. Ultimately, the network was unhappy with the pilot and decided not to place it on its schedule. Objections included the nonlinear storyline, the ages of Harring and Watts (whom they considered too old), cigarette smoking by Ann Miller's character and a close-frame shot of dog feces in one scene. Lynch remembered, [...] "All I know is, I loved making it, ABC hated it, and I don't like the cut I turned in. I agreed with ABC that the longer cut was too slow, but I was forced to butcher it <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> deadline, and there wasn't time to finesse anything. It lost texture, big scenes and storylines, and there are 300 tape copies of the bad version circulating around. Lots of people have seen it, which is embarrassing, because they're bad-quality tapes, too. I don't {{want to think about}} it." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] he was 23–7 and won {{his third}} AL Pitcher of the Year Award as Cleveland won the pennant. The Indians set an AL record with 111 wins. (The record stood until major league seasons were {{lengthened}} to 162 games, {{and it has}} been surpassed twice since then.) Lemon was named Cleveland's starter for game one of the 1954 World Series. After nine innings, the Indians and Giants were tied 2–2. Lemon stayed in the game to pitch the tenth and final inning, but he surrendered a three-run home run to pinch hitter Dusty Rhodes and the Indians lost, 5–2. Indians manager Al López went with Lemon again in the fourth game after only two days rest. [...] "He hasn't worked that close together all year <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good bunch of other pitchers, but a year ago, he and Wynn and Garcia pitched every third day for practically a month. Bob will be all right", Lopez said. Lemon and the Indians lost the game, 7–4, as the Giants swept the Series four games to none. In his two appearances, he went 0–2 with a 6.75ERA, allowed eight walks and recorded 11 strikeouts.|$|E

In July 2011, Adrianne Palicki was {{confirmed}} for the lead female role of Lady Jaye, and Ray Stevenson was confirmed to portray the villain Firefly. Arnold Vosloo also confirmed that he would reprise his role of Zartan, although in the final film Vosloo appears only in a couple of non-dialogue scenes, with Jonathan Pryce playing Zartan in most scenes. Joseph Mazzello was confirmed to play Mouse. In August 2011, Walton Goggins was added as Warden Nigel James, and it was confirmed that Bruce Willis was cast to star in the film as the original G.I. Joe. The character of Joe Colton was a replacement for fan-favorite Joe character Sgt. Slaughter. Sgt. Slaughter stated that he [...] "was originally supposed to be the part of Bruce Willis' [...] Sgt. Slaughter but <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> conflict in toy companies, Hasbro and Mattel, I wasn't able to do it.

[...] "Even when we produced the Spanish movie, I had intended to remake it <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> very different screenplay that, because of money and time, got turned into the movie you saw – which is great, but there was this other structure for the original script that I wanted to try. So even before we shot the first film it was an economic decision, a pre-existing creative decision, to change it." [...] Del Toro also praised the new film's director. [...] "We have Mark Pellington attached as director – I'm a big fan of his The Mothman Prophecies and his video work – and we are out to actors, so we're hoping to get things going soon." [...] On August 30, 2011, it was reported that American actress Amy Adams was in talks to star as Laura, the main character, who was played by Belén Rueda in the original film.

Tréluyer was delighted with the victory, saying: [...] "What a race, It was a tough lights-to-flag job, just like at Silverstone, but it was huge fun and we’re already looking forward to Le Mans." [...] He further stated: [...] "We did it and I am very happy for the team <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> really strong weekend and it feels great to win in this fashion." [...] Lotterer said of the result: [...] "It's no holds barred {{all the time and}} is very fun, especially at Spa-Francorchamps. It's for this type of race that we hit track." [...] Dumas, who finished in second alongside Lieb and Jani, stated he found driving in dry weather conditions difficult because he was not experienced participating in such conditions. Lieb said his battle with Tréluyer was [...] "great" [...] and said the contact between the two drivers was part of motor racing. Jani stated while he did not win the race he praised his car. Third-place co-finisher Webber said that his team had [...] "too many own goals" [...] and that they did not wanted to be [...] "gifted results" [...] if they were not performing at the highest level. Bernhard said that despite taking the stop-and-go penalty his team did not give up and gave it their best effort to stand on the podium.|$|E
500|$|La Dispute {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} Wildlife in pieces to accommodate their intense tour schedule. The album was recorded at two different studios with recording engineers Andrew Everding and Joe Pedulla. They {{started with the}} instrumentation of six tracks at Drasik Studios in Chicago; this recording process took place over two weeks. The songwriting featured on the album is distinct from La Dispute's previous releases. Dreyer wrote the stories or the concepts behind each song, and then the band adapted these stories into lyrics and created music to revolve around them. In an interview, Dreyer was asked how the songwriting differs; {{he said that the}} lyrics were written before the music was composed. He was quoted as saying: [...] "This time around, we switched the process up entirely. Previous to Wildlife, we'd always start music first and add vocals later based on the way the song felt. This time around, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> more concrete concept going into it, and because we wanted to work even more as a single unit [...] " [...] Dreyer and the rest of La Dispute had expressed interest in writing a conceptual record, but with ambiguity so it would not limit the listener's experience. [...] "Oftentimes, I think records with a linear narrative narrow the ways in which a person can enjoy it, and not everyone wants to sit down and listen to something front to back." [...] When they returned from their touring in Australia in February 2011 they [...] "dropped {{off the face of the}} earth" [...] for two months, during which their writing sessions lasted twelve to fourteen hours a day.|$|E

500|$|MPC {{additionally}} {{worked on}} the disappearing waterfall that serves as Jennifer's grave when she is killed {{at the beginning of}} the film. They transformed the mysterious waterfall into a whirlpool. [...] "We came up with an approach that we thought would work <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of confidence in our water sims", stated Nordby. [...] "The waterfall appears both as a day and night shot, so we had to integrate with the water. And the night shots play a pivotal role in the film, and we do a huge crane over." [...] They could not lock it to a pan or to a tilt and filming the shots was difficult due to the actual base of the waterfall being out of reach. Nordby said, [...] "I eventually lowered down a shot—a ton of reference of the area because I knew we'd have to do some digi-matte work to recreate the basin that the whirlpool ends up in." [...] They soon realized that there was an insufficient amount of churning and foam to read as real as the location. The CG Supervisor, Pete Dionne, presented a different idea. [...] "He grabbed chunks of that river and tialing it so that it had a nice stretch of birds' eye point of view of the water that existed on the location in the lighting situation we were trying to match", stated Nordby. [...] "And then he projected that onto a whirlpool of animated sprites and had similar enough texture to the actual water that existed there, but pulled control into lighting it and could add depth mainly to the center of it." [...] Dealing with [...] "very shallow" [...] water, the team had to take extra care when filming the scenes.|$|E

2500|$|The final mix of [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] {{was based}} on two {{different}} versions. Producer Steve Lillywhite, who in December 1986 was hired by U2 to help mix some of The Joshua Tree, {{was asked by the}} Edge [...] "to fly over from one version to another version". Without access to modern day samplers at the time, Lillywhite had to match the tempos of the two tape recordings by hand and then, as they played, transfer the requested sections of each onto a half-inch tape recorder. He said it [...] "was never all played at the same time; it was a real mish-mash of two things." [...] Lanois said Lillywhite's final mix was much different from his and Eno's version, leaning more heavily on effects and overdubs: [...] "I wouldn't have had as many effects on it, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> bit of a purist attitude toward some of these recordings, essentially that there was a sound that was captured in performance in a room, and we wanted to remain loyal to that space, to convey that sound.

2500|$|Chevrolet {{designer}} Clare MacKichan recalled {{about creating}} the Chevy II: [...] "There {{was no time}} for experimentation or doodling around with new ideas from either the engineers or from us in design; And {{it had to be a}} basic-type car." [...] The 1962 Chevy II rode a 110-inch wheelbase, compared to 109.5 for the Ford Falcon, at which Chevy's new compact was aimed. [...] "I think that was the quickest program we ever did at any time," [...] he continued. [...] "We worked night and day on that car, and it didn't take very long to run it through our shop <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> deadline." [...] And that's what made the Chevy II one of the fastest new-car development programs in GM history – just 18 months after the designers got the green light, the first production Chevy II rolled off the Willow Run, Michigan, assembly line in August 1961, in time for its September 29 introduction. Unlike the Corvair, the 1962 Chevy II was deliberately never intended to be revolutionary in concept or execution; its mission was to give Chevrolet buyers a simple, back-to-the-basics compact car. When he announced the Chevy II to the press, Chevrolet General Manager Ed Cole described the car as offering [...] "maximum functionalism with thrift." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1846, the sisters' poems were {{published}} in one volume as Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. The Brontë sisters had adopted pseudonyms for publication, preserving their initials: Charlotte was [...] "Currer Bell", Emily was [...] "Ellis Bell" [...] and Anne was [...] "Acton Bell". Charlotte wrote in the 'Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell' that their [...] "ambiguous choice" [...] was [...] "dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively masculine, while we {{did not like to}} declare ourselves women, <b>because...</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice". Charlotte contributed 19 poems, and Emily and Anne each contributed 21. Although the sisters were told several months after publication that only two copies had sold, they were not discouraged (of their two readers, one was impressed enough to request their autographs). The Athenaeum reviewer praised Ellis Bell's work for its music and power, singling out his poems as the best: [...] "Ellis possesses a fine, quaint spirit and an evident power of wing that may reach heights not here attempted", and The Critic reviewer recognised [...] "the presence of more genius than it was supposed this utilitarian age had devoted to the loftier exercises of the intellect." ...|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the same}} time, Hillary Clinton said {{regarding}} Martin Luther King, Jr. {{in an interview}} with Fox News, [...] "I would point to the fact that that Dr. King's dream began to be realized when President Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, when he was able to get through Congress something that President Kennedy was hopeful to do, the President before had not even tried, but it took a president to get it done. That dream became a reality, the power of that dream became real in people's lives <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> president who said {{we are going to do}} it, and actually got it accomplished." [...] Some African-American leaders took this statement as a denigration of the accomplishments of King and the larger Civil Rights Movement. Hillary Clinton proceeded to blame Obama for the controversy, claiming his campaign had fanned the flames, a charge which Obama dismissed as [...] "ludicrous." [...] By shortly before, and during, a January 15 Democratic debate in Nevada, Clinton and Obama declared a truce on the matter, with both making reconciliatory statements about race, gender, and each other. However, Clinton's support among African Americans was thought to be damaged, with SUNY Albany's Debra Dickerson stating [...] "The Clintons have to do something dramatic and symbolic to win back the trust of many African-Americans." ...|$|E
