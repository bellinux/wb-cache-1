The choreography was done by Danielle Polanco and Jonte' Moaning, who used a 1980s retro set. Beyoncé explained the concept of the video at MTV: [...] "It's probably the most flamboyant video, and the metallic dresses are so beautiful, they added so much color. I had to do a video for this song. Everyone wanted to know what a 'freakum dress' was, and you can't really explain it, you have to see it.

500|$|Dave Zinkoff, {{the public}} address announcer, began announcing Chamberlain's point total after {{each of his}} baskets. With ten minutes {{to play in the}} game, Warriors forward Tom Meschery sensed the team concept {{breaking}} down. The team's offense had shifted to getting Chamberlain the ball and then stopping and watching instead of cutting and moving without the ball. Chamberlain needed 25points with eight minutes remaining to reach 100, a rate equivalent to 150points in a full game. He scored his 79th point with 7:51 left, breaking his own record and sending the crowd into a frenzy. The 4,124 spectators screamed, [...] "Give it to Wilt! Give it to Wilt!" [...] After he reached 80, the crowd yelled for 100. Chamberlain thought, [...] "Man, these people are tough. I'm tired. I've got 80 points and no one has ever scored 80." [...] The Warriors continued giving Chamberlain the ball. Warrior Al Attles later explained, [...] "We wanted that Wilt got the record, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> liked him."

Actually, he took a straight influence from this band on the way he played the bass and the keys.

And then Tash was thinking she wanted to do a bawdy song. And I said no. She wanted to do a bawdy British schoolboy read on a carol. And I said, “no, we’re not doing that, we’re not shocking grandma”. I came up with this idea of ‘Holly, Ivy and Rose’ and she really took to that idea. So in the end both of them are there.

They were all in their very early-20s. According to Zehr, the group would play several shows a week that were booked under different band names to get around local clubs' rules preventing artists from playing that close to each other. Their playing then got the attention of Mike Denneen, Boston-based producer of Fountains of Wayne, who agreed to help them produce a 2-song demo record. Denneen also introduced them to Kiss guitarist Paul Stanley, who was strongly supportive.|$|E

[...] The author also mentions other functions of the guys: [...] "various members of the Memphis Mafia had ... played vital roles in keeping Elvis' numerous dirty secrets out of the public eye. A couple of them had been arrested with false prescriptions attempting to collect drugs for Elvis, quite a few had taken physical hits in the service of protecting Elvis and none were paid more than $500 a week. For that they were often shouted at, abused and belittled by the King when he felt like it." [...] noted Buzz Cason. Marty Lacker states, [...] "Everyone had assigned responsibilities and they were far from leeches, hangers on or whatever else they were called." [...] "They all had jobs to do so that Elvis could do his and as far as being there for the money, that's laughable because there really wasn't much in that area to be there for." [...] Marty went on to say, [...] "Most of us were not there for the money, we were there <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> cared about Elvis and each other like brothers." ...|$|E
