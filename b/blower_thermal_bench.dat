40|$|The {{automotive}} {{cooling system}} has unrealized potential to improve {{internal combustion engine}} performance through enhanced coolant temperature control and reduced parasitic losses. Advanced automotive thermal management systems use controllable actuators (e. g., smart thermostat valve, variable speed water pump, and electric radiator fan) that must work in harmony to control engine temperature. One important area of cooling system operation is warm-up, during which fluid flow is regulated between the bypass and radiator loops. A fundamental question arises regarding {{the usefulness of the}} common thermostat valve. In this paper, four different thermostat configurations have been analyzed, with accompanying linear and nonlinear control algorithms, to investigate warm-up behaviors and thermostat valve operations. The configurations considered include factory, two-way valve, three-way valve, and no valve. Representative experimental testing was conducted on a steam-based <b>thermal</b> <b>bench</b> to examine the effectiveness of each valve configuration in the engine cooling system. The results clearly demonstrate that the three-way valve has the best performance as noted by the excellent warm-up time, temperature tracking, and cooling system power consumption. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to propose {{diagnosis}} methods based on fractional order models and to validate their efficiency to detect faults occurring in thermal systems. Indeed, it is first shown that fractional operator allows to derive in a straightforward way fractional models for thermal phenomena. In order to apply classical diagno- sis methods, such models could be approximated by integer order models, but at the expense of much higher involved parameters and reduced precision. Thus, two diagnosis methods initially developed for integer order models are here extended to handle fractional order models. The first one is the generalized dynamic parity space method and the second one is the Luenberger diagnosis observer. Proposed methods are then applied to a single-input multi-output <b>thermal</b> testing <b>bench</b> and demonstrate the methods efficiency for detecting faults affecting thermal systems...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{thermomechanical}} {{fatigue life}} (TMF) prediction is performed on an automotive exhaust manifold using in-house postprocessor code (Hotlife) with four different constitutive models: elastoplastic model with kinematic hardening, two-layer viscoplastic model, and two unified elasto-viscoplastic models {{based on the}} equations proposed by Sehitoglu and Chaboche, respectively. Commercial FEA software Abaqus {{has been used for}} the analysis. The first two models are already available in Abaqus; the Chaboche and Sehitoglu models were implemented using a user material subroutine (UMAT, available in Abaqus). The stress and strain histories calculated by these four models are output to Hotlife for post-processing. The results from the prediction are then compared to the experimental TMF life obtained from a component <b>thermal</b> fatigue <b>bench</b> test. Result show the Hotlife calculations based on the two implemented elasto-viscoplastic models yield better correlation with test results...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} the bench cooling system which was developed in conjunction with the Thematic Mapper (TM), a second-generation earth resources sensor. A small, permanently evacuated dewar, which is carried into space with the instrument, is employed to provide <b>thermal</b> isolation for <b>bench</b> cooling IR detectors of many space-borne instruments. This approach has, however, a number of disadvantages.

30|$|A <b>thermal</b> {{desorption}} <b>bench</b> {{test device}} was assembled, and electromagnetic induction heating method was adopted. The obtained samples were tested at different terminal temperature and residence time, and the processing capacity of each test was about 15  kg. Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) content dropped rapidly with the terminal temperature increasing from 200 to 400  °C, and the TPH removal rate reached 96 % when terminal temperature rose to 400  °C. The terminal temperature should exceed the {{final boiling point}} of containing oil for effectively removal. The residence time increased from 20 to 30  min; drops of TPH content were obviously. Continued to increase the residence time after 30  min, the TPH content decrease became slowly. Results suggest that terminal temperature and residence time should be matched reasonably to achieve the best disposal effect. The residual oil content of solid slag reduced to 3  mg/kg under conditions of terminal temperature of 400  °C and residence time of 30  min. Low-speed stirring of the material in process was helpful to improve the disposal effect. In the process of removing oil, water contained was completely disposed. The sample quantity of bench test was much larger than that of laboratory experiment, and the results might be a direct guide for industrial applications.|$|R

40|$|The Triangle Orientation Discrimination (TOD) {{methodology}} includes i) {{a widely}} applicable, accurate end-to-end EO/IR sensor test, ii) an image-based sensor system model and iii) a Target Acquisition (TA) range model. The method {{has been extensively}} validated against TA field performance {{for a wide variety}} of well- and under-sampled imagers, systems with advanced image processing techniques such as dynamic super resolution and local adaptive contrast enhancement, and sensors showing smear or noise drift, for both static and dynamic test stimuli and as a function of target contrast. Recently, significant progress has been made in various directions. Dedicated visual and NIR test charts for lab and field testing are available and <b>thermal</b> test <b>benches</b> are on the market. Automated sensor testing using an objective synthetic human observer is within reach. Both an analytical and an image-based TOD model have recently been developed and are being implemented in the European Target Acquisition model ECOMOS and in the EOSTAR TDA. Further, the methodology is being applied for design optimization of high-end security camera systems. Finally, results from a recent perception study suggest that DRI ranges for real targets can be predicted by replacing the relevant distinctive target features by TOD test patterns of the same characteristic size and contrast, enabling a new TA modeling approach.

40|$|Microscale <b>thermal</b> analysis, <b>bench</b> scale cone calorimetric {{and real}} scale burning tests were {{conducted}} to evaluated fire safety performance of expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam. Simultaneous thermal {{analysis was used to}} study the thermal degradation of the foam in nitrogen, air, and oxygen environments at four heating rates. An endothermic effect is observed only in nitrogen environment, while two exothermic effects are observed in oxygen and air environments. In the nitrogen environment, the onset temperature of the endothermic effect and the endothermic peak temperature are much higher than that of the exothermic processes observed in air and oxygen environments. The Flynn-Wall-Ozawa method is utilized to analyze the degradation kinetics of the non-isothermal thermogravimetry. The activation energies calculated for an air environment, in a conversion range α = 20 - 70 %, are lower than those for an oxygen environment. The temperature range for this conversion range is 275 - 371 C. The enthalpies of the first exothermic effect exceed that of the oxygen environment by 10 - 45 %. Bench scale cone calorimetric tests were carried out at incident heat flux of 25, 35, and 50 kW m- 2 with two sets of cone equipment. Heat release rate, ignition time, effective heat of combustion, and critical heat flux required for ignition is obtained. In real scale burning tests, the EPS boards were ignited in sandwich structures. Fire spread speeds were derived from temperature measurement inside sandwich structure...|$|R

Results of the study defined three Space Station based experiments to demonstrate the technologies needed for an LDR type structure. The basic experiment configurations are the same as the JPL baseline except that the primary mirror truss is 10 meters in diameter instead of 20.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the design concepts and development of two types of intracavitary ultrasound applicators for use in hyperthermia cancer treatment. Acoustic field calculations, <b>thermal</b> simulations, <b>bench</b> experiments, and in vivo and in vitro studies were utilized to determine and then evaluate the final designs. Each of these devices appears to offer a significant improvement over the existing RF and microwave intracavitary hyperthermia methods. The first type of applicator consisted of a multielement array with the power level to each element independently controlled. This is an important feature in that it allows the power deposition {{along the length of}} the array to be modified during a treatment to account for changes in blood perfusion or local heating rates. A temperature regulated water bolus provided acoustic coupling and additional control over the depth of the maximum temperature from the cavity wall. These applicators were tested in vivo and in vitro and were able to induce controlled transrectal heating at depths of 2 - 3 cm in the canine rectum and prostate gland. The second type of applicator to be developed was an electrically focused array. Computer simulations were used to perform a parametric study of the design of such arrays. These results have indicated that cylindrical arrays of a practical size (7. 5 cm long, 1. 5 cm O. D.), resonating at 0. 5 MHz with individual elements that are up to 1. 5 mm wide, can preferentially heat regions 2 - 5 cm from the array surface. In addition, it was shown that the temperature distribution can be further controlled by scanning the focal position within the target volume, producing heated regions up to 4 cm wide. A practical design was developed and a prototype 0. 5 MHz array was constructed and tested in degassed water. These results were in good agreement with the corresponding theoretical simulations...|$|R

The payload is designed to measure angles of. 001 arcsec between stars during 2. 5 years and this accuracy can only be reached with the extreme stability of the device. The structure of the payload is made of carbon fiber; it is thermally stabilized with an accuracy of. 01 degrees C. During the test, the payload is enclosed in a shell made of shrouds having a geometry close to the shading structure of the spacecraft. The shroud temperatures are defined by the conditions in orbit, e. g., the spacecraft is spinning in front of the Sun with a period of two hours and the temperature of the shrouds is cycled around the payload with a 2 hour period. In order to avoid disturbances by vibrations, the payload is put on an adapter interfaced with the optical bench and the seismic block; the shrouds are supported by a carrier with no direct interface with the table. This method avoids perturbances brought about by the cooling fluid of the shrouds...|$|R

The RapidHIT® System is a fully integrated instrument with a simplified user interface enabling an operator to run the system and obtain a DNA profile from a sample {{in less than two}} hours. The integration and developmental validation of the NDIS-approved 24 loci GlobalFiler® Express kit expands the capabilities of the RapidHIT System to increase discrimination power, reduce adventitious matches, and improve cross-border data sharing capabilities. Developmental validation studies were performed according to the SWGDAM guidelines and tested several critical areas of performance including three sensitivity studies, inhibited samples, thermal cycling parameters, and cross-contamination. Validation studies indicate that the optimized PCR parameters and sensitivity of the system is capable of generating STR profiles from buccal or blood swab reference samples.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from October 12, 2016 - April 12, 2017 Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae) is a devastating pest that attacks thin-skinned stone and small fruit in all major production regions of the United States and worldwide. D. suzukii {{first appeared in the}} United States in 2008 and is believed to be native to Southeast Asia. This vinegar fly has a unique ovipositor that is serrated allowing oviposition in fully intact fruit. The larvae that emerge from the eggs damage fruit through feeding rendering them unmarketable. Typical management practices include increased pesticide applications, primarily targeting gravid females. The first objective of this research was to determine the impact of light, temperature, and forced egg retention of D. suzukii under different diurnal regimes. These regimes included cool (10 - 23 °C) and warm (12 - 27 °C) daily cycles with a 16 : 8 (light: dark), 24 h light, and 24 h dark cycles. Under all regimes, the oviposition peaked during 14 h 00 - 17 h 00. Under dark conditions, egg-laying levels were elevated compared to normal daily light regimes. Under 24 h light conditions, oviposition was reduced to virtually zero. When flies were forced to retain their eggs, oviposition occurred at elevated levels compared to treatments where there was no forced egg retention. In this treatment, oviposition started directly after the oviposition medium was offered. The second objective was to evaluate the survival of D. suzukii larvae when exposed to temperatures on a thermogradient bench ranging from 29 - 49 °C for 60 minutes. Lower temperatures resulted in the highest survival levels. At 38 - 45 °C, survival was significantly reduced to virtually zero. Four-day-old larvae were additionally exposed to ‘heat conditioning treatments’ to determine if pre-conditioning would allow increased larval survival at temperatures above 38 °C. Larval ‘heat therapy treatments’ included 30, 60, and 90 min at 35 °C. All larvae were then allowed to cool to room temperature (22 °C) for 60 mins prior to being exposed to thermogradient temperatures within a <b>thermal</b> heat <b>bench.</b> Larval survival for no heat therapy and 90 -minute heat therapy treatments (no and less optimal heat therapy) were statistically similar. Larval survival for more optimal heat therapy treatments (30 and 60 minute treatments) were statistically similar. More flies emerged in optimal heat therapy treatments compared to the less optimal and no heat therapy treatments. At 41 - 48 °C, the more optimal heat therapy treatments resulted in adult D. suzukii emergence and showed higher emergence trends compared to the no heat therapy and less optimal treatments. This research contributed to the understanding of D. suzukii oviposition behavior and ability to adapt to heat extremes as described above. This information can be incorporated into pest management strategies to reduce pesticide reliance and lead to better control methods. Knowing the heat necessary to restrict larval survival may be incorporated by increasing the heat surrounding the fruiting plant. Using black weed mat while pruning potentially could increase heat. This could be paired with adding lighting during the vulnerable growing period when D. suzukii are likely to attack. Both recommendations need to be researched in an outside growing environment before industry implantation...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigations}} on the accident behaviour of the HTR-Modul was an assessment of expected risk. In addition to accidents in which forced cooling of the core is not possible for a prolonged period of time/ a further priority issue was the analysis of event sequences after steam generator leaks. It {{became apparent that the}} accident topology of the HTR-Modul is no longer characterized by failure of the core cooling system, {{as in the case of}} larger plants, since the possible temperature loads on the fuel elements only slightly impair their capacity to retain fission products. This is the characteristic design feature of the modular reactor; due to the coregeometry, power and power density', there is no need for a forced cooling of the core in order to prevent fission product release, even in the long term. In the case of failure of the operational cooling system, the afterheat is passively dissipated via the surface of the reactor pressure vessel to a surface cooling system lining the concrete reactor cell. The reactor pressure vessel and concrete structures are thus protected against excessively high temperatures. The fuel element temperatures reach a maximum of 1100 °C in a pressurized reactor without forced cooling. The temperatures rise to 1000 °C in the top reflector and to 320 °C in the reactor pressure vessel wall; they thus remain below the respective values specified. In the case of a depressurized reactor, the fuel element temperature increases to 510 °C and the vessel temperature to 350 °C, whereas the temperature of the top reflector decreases to 600 °C. An additional failure of the surface cooler essentially affects only the temperatures in the walls of the reactor pressure vessel and reactor cell. The vessel then reaches 600 °C and has to be depressurized. The concrete structures retain enough of their load-carrying capacity to ensure the stability of the vessel. Rupture of the sphere discharge tube was examined in order to comprehensively cover problems of criticality in hypothetical events. A high subcriticality was ascertained even for the most unfavourable rearrangement of the pebble bed. In order to control operational disturbances which would prevent a shutdown of the plant, in all cases scram of the reactor and also of the blower is envisaged for the HTR-Modul. In the case of failure of the steam generator feed together with postulated failure of <b>blower</b> scram, a <b>thermal</b> overloading of the primary circuit is not expected. The heat capacity of the primary circuit components is sufficient to absorb the stored energy of the core without the. vessel temperatures exceedingthe permissible value of 400 °C. If the reactor scram were assumed to fail simultaneously the blower would be endangered in the first instance. Studies on the pressure build-up in the primary circuit in connection with steam generator leaks have revealed that the primary circuit remains completely functional as a barrier for the risk-relevant leak sizes (< IF) even if steam generator depressurization fails. Only if the gas purification plant also fails does the pressure limiting valve of the primary circuit respond with a filtered release of the activity to the environment. If the steam generator is properly depressurized, the valve responds only once, releasing about 10...|$|R
