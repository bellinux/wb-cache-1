To {{overcome}} {{the most serious}} recession since the Great Depression, this policy brief proposes and details a European Recovery Programme, consisting of a substantial and coordinated fiscal stimulus complemented by measures to strengthen fiscal sustainability.

30|$|The {{aim of the}} EU Structural Funds is to {{increase}} long-term sustainable growth of the lagging areas. However, soon after {{the outbreak of the}} crisis, the European Commission put forward a recovery plan in which it encouraged the use of EU Structural Funds for counter-cyclical aims (European Commission 2008 a, b). In particular, the Commission suggested increasing the spending through the combination of both EU funding and national <b>budgetary</b> <b>stimulus</b> packages, which should be coordinated in order to avoid negative spillovers across countries (European Commission 2008 a). With regard to money available for the cohesion policy, the recovery plan envisaged to accelerate program implementation rather than {{to increase}} funding per se. It translated into an ease of administrative procedures, an increase of projects pre-financing and a decrease of national co-funding share, allowing countries to increase up-front spending as the pressure on national budget constraints is reduced. The Commission encouraged member States to “re-prioritize” cohesion investments in view of the ongoing turbulent economic situation: it invited national governments “to explore possible changes in priorities and objectives with a view to accelerate the spending in the areas with more growth potential. This could include more focus on energy efficiency measures, including in housing, and strengthening the focus of support for small and medium enterprises, which are the main motor for growth in the European economy.” (European Commission 2008 b, pg. 4).|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY As long as {{the crisis}} was {{expected}} to be short-lived, Europe could afford not to reflect on its potential consequences for medium-term growth. Urgent tasks ahead and the longer-term agenda could remain dis-connected. This is no longer justified. Indeed, the seeds of future growth performance are sown – or not – during crises. Countries that have gone through deep crises have found that the loss in output is generally not recovered rapidly, if at all, and that medium-term performance depends on the choice of crisis management measures. Five factors can either help or harm medium-term growth: the size and duration of stimulus packages; their content; labour market policies; bank restructuring and lending behaviour; and research and development expenditures. POLICY CHALLENGE Policies that can improve medium-term performance should be prioritised. This leads to six policy recommendations: i) governments should explicitly announce state-contingent, not time-contingent, <b>budgetary</b> strategies; ii) <b>stimulus</b> packages should put more emphasis on pro-growth policies such as education and innovation; iii) bank restructuring should be speeded-up; iv) employment support should be temporary, economy-wide, and should avoid favouring particular firms or sectors, or taking people out of the labour market; v) support to large firms in traditional industries should be conditional on restructuring; vi) the pro-cyclicality of innovation efforts should be addressed in order to limit the fall in R&D intensity during the crisis and sow the seeds of pro-ductivity gains when recovery starts. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a perspective on}} how the IMF assesses a “sound fiscal policy,” focusing principally on industrial and emerging market economies. It observes six central criteria: the short-term fiscal policy stance, with greater emphasis on automatic stabilizers than discretionary fiscal policy; relevance of medium- and sometimes long-term issues; fiscal sustainability; capacity for aggregate fiscal policy implementation (including political economy factors); structural content of fiscal policy (tax efficiency and public expenditure quality); and institutional, governance, and process issues associated with budget implementation and revenue collection. Greater emphasis could be placed on an adequate margin to deal with uncertain long-term challenges.
