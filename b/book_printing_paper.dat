By {{the end of the}} century this had largely replaced hand-painting for complex designs, except at the luxury end of the market, and the vast majority of the world's decorated pottery uses versions of the technique to the present day.The perfecting of underglaze transfer printing is widely credited to Josiah Spode the first. The process had been used as a development from the processes used in <b>book</b> <b>printing,</b> and early <b>paper</b> quality made a very refined detail in the design incapable of reproduction, so early print patterns were rather lacking in subtltey of tonal variation.

40|$|Reproduced {{with the}} {{permission}} of Oxford University PressThe core concern of media studies today is the material form of mediation. In whichever direction we take our analyses, the specificity of the discipline lies in its attention to the detailed functioning of textuality. The sociology of communication, the political economy of the media, the philosophy of media aesthetics are distinctive subdisciplines of other, older, fields of research. What distinguishes ours is the irreducible materiality of mediation. We can perhaps feel that we are less prone to overgeneralisation, mythmaking and simple errors of fact because of that attention; and {{that we are in a}} better position to make statements about audiences, institutions, economies, societies, cultures and aesthetics because we have spent long years, both individually and as a research community, looking at the minutiae of historical and contemporary media. And yet we seem to have betrayed the digital media not only in the failure to archive electronic media but intellectually too: in the half-acceptance of a view that the digital media in some way effective dematerialisethe older media. Once dematerialised, media can no longer fall into our field or, alternatively, we are confronted with the proposal that we abandon the central object of our studies, the materiality of the text, and remake ourselves in the theoreticis mould with which the US academy in particular greeted the embarrassingly political discourses of 1970 s 'Screen Theory'. As literary theory has pursued the dematerialisation of the <b>book,</b> <b>print,</b> <b>paper</b> and inks in the abstraction of the text, so media studies faces a choice between dematerialising and rematerialising its object.

As many do, and ever more must do, in these our years and times.

50|$|The {{methods used}} for the {{printing}} and binding of books continued fundamentally unchanged from the 15th century into the early 20th century. While there was more mechanization, a book printer in 1900 had {{much in common with}} Gutenberg.

Modern <b>paper</b> <b>books</b> are <b>printed</b> on <b>papers</b> designed specifically for <b>printed</b> <b>books.</b> Traditionally, <b>book</b> <b>papers</b> are off-white or low-white papers (easier to read), are opaque to minimise the show-through of text {{from one side of the}} page to the other and are (usually) made to tighter caliper or thickness specifications, particularly for case-bound books.
