In the late 1930s, some local affiliates proposed shifting their emphasis from civil liberties appellate actions, to becoming a legal aid society, centered on store front offices in low income neighborhoods. The ACLU directors rejected that proposal.

5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E
5|$|In a {{major change}} from 2001—when one unnamed former NBA {{executive}} stated that a franchise would not return to Vancouver in his lifetime—Stern revealed in February 2011 that Vancouver was being considered along with Pittsburgh, Tampa and Kansas City. Reasons for considering Vancouver are the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, which for several years in the early 2010s was roughly at par with the U.S. dollar; the influx of international players who would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> play in Canada; sell-outs for pre-season exhibition games at Rogers Arena (the new name of GM Place); Vancouver having a state-of-the-art venue; and an increased realization among NBA executives that the Vancouver failure was not predominantly {{because of lack of}} interest for basketball in Vancouver. The city has also been through a resurrection in professional sports, with the creation of the Vancouver Giants in junior hockey, the 2010 Winter Olympics, and Vancouver Whitecaps FC joining Major League Soccer. However, the location of the city also allows for more varied sports experiences, such as skiing, hunting, fishing and golf, which could partially limit the interest for spectator sports. In addition, the Canadian dollar dramatically weakened against its U.S. counterpart later in the decade, dropping as low as 68 U.S. cents during 2016. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman cited this as a major reason why the league deferred Quebec City's bid to rejoin the NHL.|$|E

5|$|NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{addressed the}} issue of head injuries in professional football during a talk held on November 15, 2012 at the Harvard School of Public Health. In the talk, he highlighted the NFL's efforts to reduce head injuries by enacting measures such as penalizing hits to the head, better assessing concussions on the sideline, and removing players from the game after they have been diagnosed or suspected of having sustained a concussion. He also discussed the need for increased research on brain injuries and long-term disorders, and called for a culture change in the league, saying that players need to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> acknowledge their injuries to medical staff. In September 2012 the league pledged a $30 million donation to the National Institutes of Health to research the connection between brain injuries and long-term mental health issues. Beginning in 2012 the NFL was the subject of several lawsuits initiated by former players who alleged that the league withheld information and misled players about the potential long-term impacts of head injuries. Six of the lawsuits were approved to be tried together. In August 2013 the NFL reached a settlement with more than 4,500 former players, agreeing to pay $765 million to be used to pay for medical examinations for former NFL players and for research and education purposes. Additionally, the funds will also be used to compensate former players who are determined to have significant cognitive impairment.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} if patients allow medical students to perform less invasive procedures compared to more invasive procedures, {{and how this}} is related to patient demographics and previous experience with medical students. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in six areas of Birmingham, UK. All members {{of the general public}} over the age of 18 were eligible, excluding non-English speaking people and those with cognitive impairments. Respondents were asked to rank their willingness for medical students to perform history taking/examinations and clinical procedures of varying degrees of invasiveness. Results: We received a total of 293 responses. For both history taking/examinations and clinical procedures, people <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> allow medical students to perform less invasive procedures rather than more invasive procedures. White and older people <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> allow all history taking/examinations procedures; additionally, women <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> allow history taking.

25|$|Bernard Lewis has {{cited the}} Greek philosopher Aristotle who, in his {{discussion}} of slavery, stated that while Greeks are free by nature, 'barbarians' (non-Greeks) are slaves by nature, in that it is in their nature to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> submit to despotic government. Though Aristotle does not specify any particular races, he argues that people from outside Greece are more prone to the burden of slavery than those from Greece. While Aristotle makes remarks about the most natural slaves being those with strong bodies and slave souls (unfit for rule, unintelligent) which would seem to imply a physical basis for discrimination, he also explicitly states that the right kind of souls and bodies don't always go together, implying that the greatest determinate for inferiority and natural slaves versus natural masters is the soul, not the body. This proto-racism is seen as an important precursor to modern racism by classicist Benjamin Isaac.|$|E
25|$|On January 8, 1863, Governor Leland Stanford ceremoniously broke {{ground in}} Sacramento, California, to begin {{construction}} of the Central Pacific Railroad. After great initial progress along the Sacramento Valley, construction was slowed, first by {{the foothills of the}} Sierra Nevada, then by cutting a railroad bed up the mountains themselves. As they progressed higher in the mountains, winter snowstorms and a shortage of reliable labor compounded the problems. Consequently, after a trial crew of Chinese workers was hired and found to work successfully, the Central Pacific expanded its efforts to hire more emigrant laborers—mostly Chinese. Emigrants from poverty stricken regions of China, many of which suffered from the strife of the Taiping Rebellion, seemed to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> tolerate the living and working conditions on the railroad construction, and progress on the railroad continued. The increasing necessity for tunneling as they proceeded up the mountains then began to slow progress of the line yet again.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{for this}} {{prediction}} {{has been found}} in many different species. In hens, those near peak fertility show a preference for socially dominant roosters with large combs. Larger combs have been reliably associated with health and offspring survival so reliably indicate the genetic quality of the rooster. In the non-fertile phases, hens mate more indiscriminately with less regard for the larger comb size. A similar pattern emerges in humans. A review of relevant studies on female preferences across the ovarian cycle reveals that women show a greater preference for masculine traits in fertile phases, especially for short term mating intention. This finding occurs across a variety of traits, such as masculine voices, body and facial features, scent, and behavioural displays. The level of masculinity acts as an indicator of genetic quality through its association with high testosterone. Similarly, women show a preference for higher levels of symmetry, which is thought to indicate underlying developmental stability. However, during infertile phases, women prefer males with lower masculinity and symmetry, as they tend to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> offer material benefits.|$|E

40|$|Females {{have largely}} been {{neglected}} in the risk taking literature. Risk taking {{is thought to be}} a male trait, adapted to compete against other males (intrasexual competition) for access to mates. The following thesis proposes that women also have an incentive to compete intrasexually to attain a mate, and thus an incentive to take risks. However the types of risk women take will differ from that of men. Specifically, intrasexual competition <b>will</b> drive women <b>to</b> take sexual and appearance risks, and drive men to take financial, physical and sexual risks. Three hundred and seventy-two participants completed an online questionnaire which measured their individual levels of intrasexual competition using Buunk & Fisher’s (2009) Intrasexual Competition Scale, and measured their willingness to engage in a range of financial, physical, sexual and appearance risks. It was found that overall males <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take physical and sexual risks, and women <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take <b>more</b> financial and appearance risks. Furthermore it was found that people with higher levels of intrasexual competition <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take physical, sexual and appearance risks than those with lower levels of intrasexual competition. However there was no association found between levels of intrasexual competition willingness to take financial risks. The following findings were made within each gender: Within men, those with higher levels of intrasexual competition <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take physical and sexual risks than those with lower levels of intrasexual competition. Within women, those with higher levels of intrasexual competition <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take physical, sexual, and appearance risks than those with lower levels of intrasexual competition.

2500|$|Some immigrants, {{particularly}} those from cultures {{in which women}} are subordinate to men, may express disapproval {{about the influence of}} American culture on girls and women. Men in particular may perceive women from their own cultural heritage who have assimilated into American society as too [...] "independent" [...] and thus incompatible with the traditional family structures that such men may wish to uphold. This may cause men to seek out spouses from their home countries, believing these women will <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take on the traditional household duties of a wife. When these women come to the United States they may experience isolation, particularly if they do not have family members or friends already in the U.S. In such instances, men often control women's access to outside resources and support systems, creating a power imbalance within the home. In instances of domestic violence, this isolation may make it difficult for women to find the help they need.|$|E

Moskvin began searching for obituaries of recently dead children. When he found an obituary that [...] "spoke" [...] to him, he would sleep on her grave in order to determine if the child's spirit wished to be brought back to life. Moskvin claimed he had been doing this for around twenty years and insisted that when he began, he never dug up a grave without the permission of the child within. As he grew older, it became physically painful for him to sleep on the graves, so he began bringing the bodies home where it would be more comfortable to sleep near them.
