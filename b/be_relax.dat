40|$|A new poling {{technique}} is presented, {{in which a}} series of five consecutive pulses of electric field, and with successively increasing strength is applied between the two electrodes of 65 / 35 VDF/TrFE copolymer based sensor. Between each pulse, the applied electric field is reduced to zero (short circuit). This allows deformations and space charges to <b>be</b> <b>relax,</b> resulting in more homogeneous electric field distribution with less risk for an electric breakdown. It is conducted at room temperature and is compatible with semiconductor technology. This step-wise poling {{technique is}} characterised by a low breakdown rate and yields a high pyroelectric coefficien...|$|E
40|$|The {{existing}} {{theory of}} the microscopic interpretation of the dynamical contribution to zero-field muon depolarization spectra in a longitudinal geometry is developed. The predicted relaxation of the muon depolarization is calculated from two forms of the spin correlation function. First, when the spin correlation function has an exponential form with a single wave vector dependent relaxation rate is considered, it is shown that this form of the spin correlation function reproduces the slow and fast fluctuation limits of stochastic spin theory regardless of the choice of microscopic spin model. Second, if the spin correlation function is a homogeneous scaling function (such as a power-law decay with time), {{as suggested by the}} mode-coupling theory of spin dynamics, this results in a stretched exponential relaxation of the muon spectra. For simple spin diffusion, the muon spectra are shown to <b>be</b> <b>relax</b> with a root-exponential form. Comment: 5 pages, 1 figur...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to expose}} the social economic of Pemulung community in TPA Lubuk Minturun. This research applies qualitative research. The informan of this research are Pemulung in TPA Air Dingin Kelurahan Balai Gadang, Kecamatan Koto Tangah Kota Padang by using snowball sampling. The datas are gathered by observing, interviewing, and documenting. In purpose of keeping the data authenticity, it is needed the explanations from the credible information (credible and realiable) from the selected items (Mestika Zed, 1999). The research show that {{the low level of}} education of Pemulung does not affect toward their income in TPA Air Dingin because what they do, does not need certain skills and education. Their strategies to gather things are to search them form early morning and they involve all of family members in term of “Maraok”. While in marketing strategy, they sell the thing they have got to the collector (Lapak owner) who wants to buy more expensive or they sell whenever the price is higher. Pemulung in TPA Air Dingin have never got direct financial security from the government of Padang, so that it affects to the structural poverty. The way of live they have cause such a structural poverty. They are used to <b>be</b> <b>relax</b> and feel comfort with their work system. Pemulung in TPA Air Dingin do not want to change the system that they have made, so that still live in the circle of cultural poverty...|$|E

40|$|There are two {{problems}} in the result of research that {{will be discussed in}} this article. They are (1) how are the steps of the implementation of suggestopedia method in learning speaking English at the second semester students of E class TBI STAIN Pamekasan and (2) How are the increasing of speaking English skill for the second semester students of E class TBI STAIN Pamekasan in learning speaking English by using the suggestopedia method. The research method is classroom action research by using research strategy of Kemmis and Mc Taggert Model which consist of four (4) steps, namely planning, acting, observing, and reflecting. The result of research provided that classically for the 1 st, 2 nd, and 3 rd cycle indicated the increasing of students learning completeness scores, each of them are 38. 23 %, 67. 54 %, and 82. 35 %. While the students performance for each aspects are increasing from the 1 st cycle up to 3 rd cycle. The students performance of speaking English activities in the classroom from each aspects that more appear was grammar with score 85. 2 %. for the 2 nd cycle was comprehensibility with score 88. 2 % and vocabulary with score 88. 2 %, and for the 3 rd   cycle that more appear was fluency with score 91. 2 %.   Besides, for the frequency percentage of students performance from each cycles are more increasing, by the 1 st   cycle 55 % (enough), the 2 nd cycle 70 % (good), and the 3 rd cycle 85 % (very good). Finally, the suggestopedia method in learning speaking English can increase the result of students learning. In fact, the students look like be enthusiastic in learning speaking English. The students were active to joint with this subject from each cycle. By the good atmosphere, conducive situation of the classroom, and soft music made the students to <b>be</b> <b>relax</b> in learning the subject. It also was increase imagination, concentration, and liveliness for the students. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Lower {{urinary tract}} {{function}} disorders are frequently seen urological problem in children, admitted {{us for the}} presence of incontinance, urgency, wetting and increased urination need. Whereas they can only be presented by recurrent urinary tract infection. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the frequency of lower urinary tract function disorders in patients coming with recurrent urinary tract infection without any complaint on history taking and to emphasize the necessity of urodynamic evaluation for etiology of recurrent urinary tract infections even if there were no any history. Material and Method: The study was conducted out by 564 patients underwent urodynamic evaluation in our clinic, 300 cases with bladder dysfunction history, underwent urodynamic evaluation were classified in group 1. In group 2 there were cases without any bladder dysfunction history but with undefined etiology of recurrent urinary tract (R. UTI) infection. Results: At the end of study, the number of cases with pathological urodynamic evaluation, were similar to each other in both groups, 86. 3 % and 84 %, respectively. In secondly taken history of group 2, it was seen that actually in 63 % of this group had complaints at beginning, only 37 % (n= 98) of them had a compatible history with former. Among the 98 cases getting sure that without any complain, 63 of them had urodynamical pathology (63 / 98; 64 %). It was seen that in 29 of 113 bladder instability case (29 / 113; 25. 6 %) in group 2, had really no bladder dysfunction complaint, the only data was recurrent urinary tract infection. Also, in 85 cases diagnosed with dysfunctional bladder, the rate of being only finding of R. UTI was found as 17 / 85; 20 % and 17 / 24; 71 % in lazy bladder. Conclusions: It is important to take a careful history from children with R. UTI’s before performing advanced exams, in the evaluation of bladder dysfunctions. As it was seen in our study, a specific and more friendly environment in which patient and parents <b>be</b> <b>relax,</b> must be supplied for a careful history taking. Also, it must be in mind that, there is urodynamical pathology without any bladder dysfunction history, in significiantly high rate of cases. (Turk Arch Ped 2013; 48 : 110 - 6...|$|E

Perfect enforcement does not exist, and we focus our test on the weaker case of whether measurable changes in time allocation appear when minimum age of employment regulation <b>is</b> <b>relaxed.</b>|$|R
