5|$|In the United States, {{fried chicken}} has stereotypically been {{associated}} with African-Americans. The reasons for this are various. Chicken dishes were popular among slaves <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War, as chickens were generally the only animals slaves were allowed to raise on their own. Minstrel shows and the film The Birth of a Nation led to a prevalent stereotype associating African-Americans with fried chicken.|$|E

5|$|Since <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War, the {{two major}} parties were the Republicans and the Democrats, and {{after the end of the}} Reconstruction Era in 1877, the {{national}} electorate was closely divided between them. Party membership was only partly based on ideology; party identification often reflected ethnic and religious background, as well as Civil War loyalties that were still keenly felt by many voters. Most Northern Protestants voted Republican, as did black Southerners. On the other hand, white Southerners and Northern Catholics generally voted Democratic.|$|E
5|$|The United States Cabinet has had 22 African-American {{appointed}} officers. The US Census Bureau defines African Americans {{as citizens}} or {{residents of the}} United States who have origins {{in any of the}} black populations of Africa.

During the founding of the federal government, African Americans were consigned to a status of second-class citizenship or enslaved. No African American ever held a Cabinet position <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> Rights Movement or the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and labor unions.|$|E
5|$|The divines {{were even}} more {{strongly}} opposed to Catholicism than to William Laud and his followers, the Laudians. They associated both Catholicism and Laudianism with Arminianism and persecution. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> war, the divines saw these two groups as {{the greatest threat to}} the church. With the rise of radical sectarian movements during the war, the divines became much more concerned with these groups than polemics against Catholicism. The divines were particularly concerned with those they labeled antinomians. This was a loose term for those who saw the moral law as in some way no longer relevant for Christians. The divines saw these groups as more immediately threatening than Catholicism.|$|E
