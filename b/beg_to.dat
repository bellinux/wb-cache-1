5|$|I {{understand}} {{there is a}} clerkship vacant in your office, and I <b>beg</b> <b>to</b> apply for the same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. I can say I am quite confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore <b>beg</b> <b>to</b> request {{that you will be}} good enough to confer the appointment on me.|$|E

It is uncertain how many children he had: the number varies between four and nine.|$|E

5|$|Brian Griffin is {{a strict}} high school English teacher at Del Norte High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico who never accepts late {{homework}} and is demanding of his students. When Mark Kinney, {{one of the}} students in his class, plagiarizes a paper Mr. Griffin makes him <b>beg</b> <b>to</b> be allowed back into the class. However, instead of allowing him back in, Mr. Griffin decides to make him repeat the class next semester. Fellow students in the class include David Ruggles, Jeff Garrett, Betsy Cline, and Susan McConnell. Mark suggests kidnapping Mr. Griffin, and convinces David, Jeff, and Betsy to join in on the plan as a way of scaring him and getting revenge because they feel he has treated them poorly.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture and}} flight tests of Koga's Zero is usually {{described}} as a tremendous coup for the Allies as it revealed the secrets of that mysterious aircraft and led directly to its downfall. According to this viewpoint, only then did Allied pilots learn {{how to deal with}} their nimble opponents. The Japanese could not agree more... Yet those naval pilots who fought the Zero at Coral Sea, Midway, and Guadalcanal without the benefit of test reports would <b>beg</b> <b>to</b> differ with the contention that it took dissection of Koga's Zero to create tactics that beat the fabled airplane. To them the Zero did not long remain a mystery plane. Word quickly circulated among the combat pilots as to its particular attributes. Indeed on 6 October while testing the Zero, Akutan Zero test pilot Frederick M. Trapnell made a highly revealing statement: 'The general impression of the airplane is exactly as originally created by intelligence—including the performance'.|$|E
5|$|With the Byzantines defeated, the {{authority}} of Ivan Asen III was shaken. He and his wife Irene secretly fled Tarnovo taking the Byzantine imperial insignia, kept in the treasury since the Bulgarian victory {{in the battle of}} Tryavna in 1190. Michael VIII was infuriated with the cowardliness of the couple and refused to grant them an audience for days. In Tarnovo, the nobility refused to open the gates to Ivaylo and instead elected for emperor George Terter, which had devastating effect on the rebels. Despite the military successes, neither was the Mongol threat dealt with, nor was Ivaylo capable to secure the support of the Bulgarian nobility and unify the country against the overwhelming forces of the Mongols and the Byzantines. As a result, Ivaylo's followers, disillusioned with the endless wars without prospects for peace, began to abandon his cause. With diminished support, in 1280 Ivaylo crossed the Danube with a few loyal associates, including Kasim <b>beg,</b> <b>to</b> seek aid from Nogai Khan.|$|E

25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I <b>beg</b> <b>to</b> take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as I can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E
25|$|Singh's studies {{spanned the}} fields of high energy physics, quantum {{mechanics}} and particle physics and he has made reportedly significant contributions on S-matrix theory and symmetry theories of hadrons. His collaboration with Virendra Gupta resulted {{in the development of}} Gupta-Singh coupling constant sum rule related to baryon decuplet and he worked along M. A. <b>Beg</b> <b>to</b> develop the Beg-Singh SU (6) mass formula. His theoretical work on scattering amplitudes have helped widen the understanding of high energy total cross-sections in hadronic processes. He proposed Singh lemma, a method of calculating the threshold value of the amplitude from the gauge condition. His other contributions include Singh-Pais theorems and Singh-Roy bounds related to compton scattering and scattering amplitudes. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and the article repository of the Indian Academy of Sciences has listed 84 of them. Besides, he has contributed chapters to books published by others including a lecture in a book edited by B. V. Sreekantan and Scientific Realism and Classical Physics, a general article published in History and Philosophy of Physics published by Indian Council of Philosophical Research. His work has also drawn citations from other authors.|$|E

25|$|When Sultan Mehmed II succeeded {{his father}} in 1451, it was widely {{believed}} that the young ruler, then 19 years old, would prove incapable—and that he would pose no great threat to Christian possessions in the Balkans and the Aegean. This optimism was reinforced by friendly assurances made by Mehmed to envoys sent to his new court. But Mehmed's actions spoke far louder than his mild words. Beginning early in 1452, he built a second Ottoman fortress (Rumeli hisarı) on the Bosphorus, on the European side several miles north of Constantinople, set directly across the strait from the similar fortress, Anadolu Hisarı, which his great-grandfather Bayezid I had previously built on the Asian side. This pair of fortresses gave the Turks complete control of sea traffic on the Bosphorus; specifically, it prevented help from the north, the Genoese colonies on the Black Sea coast, from reaching Constantinople. (The new fortress was also known as Boğazkesen, which held the dual meanings 'strait-blocker' or 'throat-cutter', emphasizing its strategic position.) In October 1452, Mehmed ordered Turakhan <b>Beg</b> <b>to</b> lead a large force into the Peloponnese and remain there to keep Thomas and Demetrios (despotes in Southern Greece) from assisting their brother Constantine XI Palaiologos during the impending siege of Constantinople.|$|E
500|$|Although Barrow {{predicted}} that Ruth would <b>beg</b> <b>to</b> return to pitching {{the first time}} he experienced a batting slump, that did not occur. Barrow used Ruth primarily as an outfielder in the war-shortened 1918 season. Ruth hit [...]300, with 11 home runs, enough to secure him a share of the major league home run title with Tillie Walker of the Philadelphia Athletics. He was still occasionally used as a pitcher, and had a 13–7 record with a 2.22 ERA.|$|E
