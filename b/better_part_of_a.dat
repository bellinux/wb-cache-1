5|$|The Roman Empire conquered Dacia in AD 101 and 106, {{during the}} rule of Trajan, and the Roman {{settlement}} Napoca, established thereafter, is first recorded on a milestone discovered in 1758 {{in the vicinity of}} the city. Trajan's successor Hadrian granted Napoca the status of municipium as municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napocenses. Later, in the 2nd century AD, the city gained the status of a colonia as Colonia Aurelia Napoca. Napoca became a provincial capital of Dacia Porolissensis and thus the seat of a procurator. The colonia was evacuated in 274 by the Romans. There are no references to urban settlement on the site for the <b>better</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> millennium thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Through the {{influence}} of a rise in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few ovarian follicles are stimulated. These follicles, which were present at birth and have been developing for the <b>better</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> year in a process known as folliculogenesis, compete with each other for dominance. Under {{the influence}} of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity. The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary, or Graafian, follicle, and it contains the ovum.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} company's major offerings, {{the chicken}} fries are {{sometimes}} the center of product advertising for the company. The original advertisements were created by the firm of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky and were the subject of both criticism and legal action by the nu metal band Slipknot over claims of intellectual property rights, while later advertising programs started the company on a new direction of digital-based, multi-media advertising. With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social media campaign to help entice fans of the product back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on product tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the product across different demographic groups. Even though the product has been a prominent part of the menu for the <b>better</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> decade, Burger King has released very few limited-time (LTO) variants of the product – its first one being released {{in the summer of}} 2015. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few, if any, global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.|$|E

25|$|Champlain also {{arranged}} to have young French men live with the natives, to learn their language and customs and help the French adapt to life in North America.

25|$|In New York he was {{steeped in}} the artistic and social ferment of the WPA period.

Far from setting out to become a ‘Dominican’ painter, he felt himself {{to be part of}} a broader tradition. Here a key influence was his mentor, the Dominican art historian and musicologist Américo Lugo Romero. With Lugo he spent almost every day of the <b>better</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> year in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, absorbing his mentor's working connoisseurship of Renaissance art as the two discussed and challenged attributions of paintings.|$|E

Eventually she made her way to Discovery Bay on 12 March 1915, where she {{anchored}} and continued to offload supplies. In May, Aurora was trapped in the ice, and was carried out to the sea, stranding the men that were setting up the depots. She remained trapped in the ice for the <b>better</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> year, drifting some 1600 nautical miles. It was not until 12 February 1916 that the ship escaped from the ice, making it back to Dunedin, New Zealand on 3 April.|$|E

These men, known as coureurs des bois (runners of the woods), were the first European mushers in North America, extended French influence south and west and in 1609, New France controlled all the Canadian Shield. In 1680, the intendant Duchesneau estimated that there was not one family in New France who did not have a “son, brother, uncle or nephew” among the Coureurs des Bois. During the winter, sled became the ordinary transportation in the north of New France.|$|E

25|$|North of Elkridge Hunt Club, whose {{golf course}} lies to the west, Charles Street {{passes through the}} hamlet of Woodbrook, within which lies the {{historic}} home Tyrconnell on Lake Roland to the west. At Bellona Avenue, which heads northwest as MD 134, Charles Street becomes a four-lane divided highway that passes through an S-curve within a forested area. The highway passes {{to the west of}} Greater Baltimore Medical Center and The Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital, then intersects Towsontown Boulevard, which leads to the old alignment of Charles Street, Charles Street Avenue, and both Towson University and the center of Towson. Charles Street veers northwest past the Loyola Blakefield school and north again {{to the top of a}} ridge where the highway passes under Joppa Road. That road is accessed at the following intersection with Bellona Road, which heads west and then south toward Riderwood and Ruxton, and Kenilworth Drive, which heads east toward the center of Towson. Charles Street has a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) before meeting a disjoint segment of Bellona Avenue at an intersection with traffic lights (for the <b>better</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> decade traffic was managed by a roundabout) on the southern edge of Lutherville. Bellona Avenue heads west toward a ramp to westbound I-695 and east to receive an exit ramp from westbound I-695 and intersect MD 131 (Seminary Avenue) within the Lutherville Historic District. Although MD 139 ends at the intersection, Charles Street continues north one block as a residential street to its northern terminus, where the road heads west into an apartment complex as Nightingale Way.|$|E
