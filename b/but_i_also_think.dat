[...] MuuMuse-editor Bradley Stern praised the concept of the video as [...] "incredible" [...] and complimented the inclusion of the horse. Popjustice called the music video a [...] "lovely pervoramic pop moment." [...] Due to its sexual content and nature, the music video was censored and banned in numerous Asian countries including Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. In an interview with Spanish television channel Cuatro, Minogue responded to the censorship and said: [...] "I think, yes, it's sexy <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> it's very touching and sensual and the message is love." ...|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{agreed that}} the {{religious}} imagery was a calculated move by Gaga to create controversy. Simon Voxick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly felt that the move was calculated, saying, [...] "Gaga wants to offend people. She's a provocateur. Gaga would probably be disappointed if no one was offended by her latest video. She's doing that stuff for a reason." [...] He {{did not think that}} the risks were very original or as exciting as the ones in [...] "Telephone." [...] "The risks that she was taking [...] were easier targets [...] It's a little bit been there, done that," [...] he said. The New York Timess Jon Caramanica thought the controversy was Gaga's attempt to take the [...] "Queen of Pop" [...] throne. He said, [...] ""I'm sure she'd say she loves Madonna ... <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> she's saying, 'This [...] is mine.' And also, like, 'I'm murdering you with my own style. I've learned this. I know how to do this ... And look how flawlessly I do it.'" [...] He did feel, however, that the religious imagery was obvious and lazy: [...] "Even the worst provocation is going to succeed. She got what she wanted." [...] Singer Katy Perry took to her Twitter account and wrote, [...] "Using blasphemy as entertainment is as cheap as a comedian telling fart jokes." [...] The Huffington Post ascertained that while Gaga had not been mentioned directly by name that it was definitely a slam by Perry towards Lady Gaga. In an interview on NRJ Radio's Le 6/9, Perry said that the tweet was not solely about Gaga, stating that it was based on her personal views of religion.|$|E

In addition to asserting that music will always be made due to its role in human expression, Albini explained that, while {{the state of the}} music industry is healthy in his view, the industry of music journalism is in crisis. Albini used the example of the media spotlight that he received after he made comments about Amanda Palmer's Kickstarter campaign, stating: [...] "I don’t think <b>I</b> was wrong <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> don’t <b>think</b> that it was that big of a deal."

[...] He also described the album as more straightforward, with a [...] "less is more" [...] approach that included reducing the number of guitar overdubs, with many of the songs including only one guitar track: [...] "We wanted a record that we could easily play live. For the most part, it's pretty bare bones while still sounding full and big." [...] The album does, however, include some synthesizer as well as a trumpet solo in the style of Neutral Milk Hotel.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon Dahlquist of The Kubrick FAQ {{argues that}} the name change [...] "deliberately mirrors Jack Torrance being both the husband of Wendy/father of Danny and the mysterious man in the July Fourth photo. It is to say he is two people: the man with choice in a perilous {{situation}} {{and the man who}} has 'always' been at the Overlook. It's a mistake to see the final photo as evidence that the events of the film are predetermined: Jack has any number of moments where he can act other than the way he does, and that his (poor) choices are fueled by weakness and fear perhaps merely speaks all the more to the questions about the personal and the political that The Shining brings up. In the same way Charles had a chance – once more, perhaps – to not take on Delbert's legacy, so Jack may {{have had a chance to}} escape his role as 'caretaker' to the interests of the powerful. It's the tragic course of this story that he chooses not to." [...] Dahlquist's argument is that Delbert Grady, the 1920s butler, and Charles Grady, the 1970s caretaker, rather than being either two different people or the same are two 'manifestations' of a similar entity; a part permanently at the hotel (Delbert) and the part which is given the choice of whether to join the legacy of the hotel's murderous past (Charles), just as the man in the photo is not exactly Jack Torrance, but nor is he someone entirely different. Jack in the photo has 'always' been at the Overlook, Jack the caretaker chooses to become part of the hotel. The film's assistant editor Gordon Stainforth has commented on this issue, attempting to steer a course between the continuity-error explanation on one side and the hidden-meaning explanation on the other; [...] "I don't think we'll ever quite unravel this.

Now, I am writing a book on botany just now, for young people, chiefly on wild flowers, and I want these two books very much; but I simply cannot afford to buy them, because I sent my last spare twenty guineas to Mr. Shields yesterday for this widow. And though you may think it not the affair of the public that I have not this book on Indian flowers, it is their affair finally, that what I write for them should be founded on as broad knowledge as possible; whatever value my own book may or may not have, it will just be in a given degree worth less to them, because of my want of this knowledge.|$|E

The idea was to keep the tone in general a little bit smaller with not so many doubles and big rock guitar and heavy spots on the record...with the lyrics of this new record being transparently about myself, I think it was important to not dehumanize the performances by over-layering them or over-doubling them. As you double vocals, they lose their intimate inflection, and whatever transparent emotion that's trying to be conveyed in them is washed out, which can be a good thing. For this record, I think it was important not to do that.|$|R

Occasionally I have found one that looked like a stupid piece of work--two or three hundred feet of alder brush and gravel across the widest part of a stream, when, by building just above or below, a dam one-fourth the length might have given them better water. This must be said, however, for the builders, that perhaps they found a better soil for digging their tunnels, or a more convenient spot for their houses near their own dam; or that they knew what they wanted better than their critic did.

500|$|The {{metaphor of}} the MCU as [...] "the world's biggest TV show" [...] was {{discussed}} again, {{after the release of}} Captain America: Civil War, by Todd VanDerWerff of Vox, who felt that film in particular highlighted Marvel's success with the model, saying, [...] "Viewed in complete isolation, the plot of Captain America: Civil War makes little to no sense ... when you think about where [...] has been in earlier Marvel films ... his leeriness about being subject to oversight makes a lot more sense." [...] VanDerWerff continued that when thinking about the MCU as a television series, many [...] "common criticisms people tend to level at it take on a new context" [...] such as complaints that the films are formulaic, lack [...] "visual spark", or [...] "shoehorn in story elements" [...] that [...] "are necessary to set up future films", all characteristics that [...] "are fairly typical on television, where a director's influence is much lower than that of the showrunner", in this case, Feige. Comparing the films to the series Game of Thrones specifically, VanDerWerff noted that each solo film checks [...] "in on various characters and their individual side stories, before bringing everyone together in the finale (or, rather, an Avengers film)", with Guardians of the Galaxy being equivalent to the character Daenerys Targaryen—"both separated by long distances from everybody else." [...] He noted that this format was an extension of early [...] "TV-like" [...] film franchises such as Star Wars, as well as the format of the comics upon which the films are based. [...] "I say all of this not to suggest that film franchises resembling TV series is necessarily a good trend", VanDerWerff concluded, [...] "For as much as I generally enjoy the Marvel movies, I'm disheartened by the possibility that their particular form might take over the film industry ... <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> don't <b>think</b> it's {{the end of the world}} if Marvel continues on ... there's a reason TV has stolen so much of the cultural conversation over the past few decades.

It's an easy show to sort of dive right into at this point, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we've designed some really fun revelations and some payoffs for people who are ardent fans. In regard to preparation for new viewers, executive producer John Eisendrath said in {{an interview}} for Entertainment Weekly: Yes, we knew that it was going to be the Super Bowl. We felt as if, first of all, we were going to get a lot of viewers who had never seen the show before.

We didn’t want to confuse any new viewers with anything that may linger in other episodes that are serialized. And we wanted to have a big, impactful event for those new viewers.
