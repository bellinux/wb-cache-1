5|$|By 1912, the use {{of horse}} and buggy {{had fallen out of}} fashion, and the Burnside Fountain saw little use in its {{intended}} purpose. By 1939 citizens of Worcester were already calling for the fountain to be moved to a more suitable place where it could be of more use. It took until 1969 for the Burnside Fountain to be moved from Central Square. It was relocated to the Worcester Common and turned to face Salem Square. One year later, in May 1970, the statue was ripped from its pedestal and stolen. It was returned later that same year, but it took until 1972 for the boy and turtle to be placed <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the basin. Another apparent theft attempt happened in 2004 when the bronze sculpture was toppled off its pedestal and left dangling off the basin. The city was quick to fix the statue this time, with it being righted and reattached within days.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland next {{lost its}} second {{straight}} game, against the Los Angeles Dons in Los Angeles. The Dons opened the scoring {{on the first}} play from scrimmage after the Browns kicked off. Chuck Fenenbock ran the ball 75 yards for a touchdown. Cleveland came back to build a 16–7 lead at halftime, but Groza missed his first extra point in 24 tries after Bill Lund ran for a touchdown in the second quarter. The missed extra point {{proved to be the}} difference in the game. Los Angeles went <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> in the fourth quarter with a Dale Gentry run for a touchdown and a field goal by Joe Aquirre with just 18 seconds left and won by one point, 17–16. A fumble by Browns halfback Ray Terrell at the Los Angeles 35-yard line in the fourth quarter gave the Dons the ball and led to Aquirre's game-winning field goal. Cleveland's running game stalled for the second game in a row; the team gained only 43 yards rushing. Bill Willis, the Browns' defensive star, sat out the entire game with a strep infection. Two other Browns players, Bob Steuber and Alex Kapter, suffered leg injuries and were helped off the field.|$|E

25|$|Mickey first {{appeared}} animated in color in Parade of the Award Nominees in 1932, however, the film strip {{was created for}} the 5th Academy Awards ceremony and was not released to the public. Mickey's official first color film came in 1935 with The Band Concert. The Technicolor film process {{was used in the}} film production. Here Mickey conducted the William Tell Overture, but the band is swept up by a tornado. It is said that conductor Arturo Toscanini so loved this short that, upon first seeing it, he asked the projectionist to run it again. In 1994, The Band Concert was voted the third-greatest cartoon of all time in a poll of animation professionals. By colorizing and partially redesigning Mickey, Walt would put Mickey <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> once again, and Mickey would reach popularity he never reached before as audiences now gave him more appeal. Also in 1935, Walt would receive a special award from the League of Nations for creating Mickey.|$|E
25|$|Kershaw and Keuchel started Game 5, in {{a rematch}} {{of the opening}} game of the series. Forsythe singled in two runs off of Keuchel {{in the first inning}} to put the Dodgers up early. A third run scored on a {{throwing}} error by Gurriel. Barnes singled in the fourth to score Forsythe. Keuchel pitched only 3 innings for the Astros, allowing five hits and four runs (three earned). This was his shortest home start of the season. The Astros scored their first run with an RBI double by Correa {{in the bottom of the}} fourth inning, followed by a three-run home run by Gurriel to tie the game. Bellinger hit a three-run home run off of Collin McHugh in the top of the fifth to put the Dodgers <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> only for Altuve to hit his own three-run home run in the bottom of the inning off Maeda to tie it back up. Kershaw pitched 4 innings and allowed six runs on four hits and three walks.|$|E
25|$|Barbados {{won three}} more titles before the tournament was {{restricted}} in the 1986–87 season – {{instead of a}} round robin league, there were now two round robin groups, determined by geography. The league was back for the next season, however, renamed to Red Stripe Cup (from the beer brand Red Stripe). Leeward Islands won their first title in 1989–90, winning all five games in the league, but Barbados were <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> for the following season. No team managed to win for two seasons in a row for the next fourteen seasons, though Leeward Islands and Barbados exchanged the trophy for six seasons between 1993–94 and 1998–99. The WICB experimented with the format in these seasons – the 1995–96 saw a final match being played, while 1996–97 had a home-and-away round robin format (so ten matches in total). The following season, the Red Stripe withdrew as sponsor, and the tournament had to be renamed the President's Cup – and cut down to five matches a team once again. For 1998–99, the soft drink Busta came in as the tournament became the Busta Cup, and the tournament now got a semi-final and a final appended after the round robin.|$|E

50|$|Tunstall's {{industries}} {{were served}} by the Trent and Mersey Canals, constructed over 11 years from 1766. The canal was designed by James Brindley, resident of Turnhurst Hall in nearby Chell. Just north of Tunstall lies one of Brindley's greatest achievements, the Harecastle Tunnel, which takes the Trent and Mersey Canal underneath Goldenhill. Barges were 'legged' through by men lying <b>on</b> their <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the barges and pushing against the roof with their feet. This was a physically demanding and slow, causing major delays, so in 1827 leading civil engineer Thomas Telford was commissioned to provide a second, and wider, parallel tunnel with a towpath. Today the Harecastle Tunnels are the fourth longest canal tunnels in the UK.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} quarter, BYU started a drive that {{occurred}} predominantly in the second quarter, and came to fruition when Taysom Hill rushed for a 1-yard touchdown, which, after the extra point was made, tied the game at seven. The tie did not last long, however, as on the ensuing kickoff, WASH's John Ross returned BYU's Justin Sorensen's kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown, putting the Huskies <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>top,</b> 14–7. On BYU's ensuing drive, this time one that lasted 10 plays, netting 48 yards, Sorensen kicked a 45-yard field goal to pull the Cougars within four points. They had the ball again after a quick three-and-out by Washington, and once again ran more than 10 plays, this time running 11 for a total of 51 yards and another Sorensen field goal, this time a 31-yard kick. Hoping to avoid another long kickoff return, Sorensen's kickoff was a short one, but the plan backfired when Washington's Jesse Callier, typically a backup running back, returned the kickoff 47 yards, allowing the Huskies to start their drive at the BYU 35-yard line. Four plays later, Sankey rushed for his second 11-yard touchdown of the game, making the score 21–13. Subsequently, BYU executed 12 plays, en route to Sorensen kicking his third field goal of the quarter as the first half's time expired, thus making the halftime score 21–16.|$|E
25|$|Early in the quarter, Ohio {{took its}} first {{lead of the}} game when Yazdani made a 28-yard field goal that culminated a 6-play, 69-yard drive. They {{surprised}} ECU on the ensuing kickoff, by attempting an onside kick, which they recovered around midfield. On their subsequent drive, Ohio drove down the field, but stalled around the 30-yard line, and settled for a 45-yard field goal attempt for Yazdani, which he missed, his first miss of the season. On the ensuing drive, ECU took advantage of two 15-yard penalties on Ohio (a personal foul and a pass interference), and Cooper rushed for a touchdown, putting ECU <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>top,</b> 24–20. Ohio failed to move the ball on their next drive, and their punt was fair caught in their own territory, setting ECU up with excellent field position, from which they embarked on a drive that culminated when, on a trick play, Carden caught a 14-yard touchdown pass from Worthy, putting ECU up 31–20. Tettleton threw an interception on Ohio's ensuing drive that again set up ECU in Ohio's territory, however this time, they did not convert a third down when at their 38-yard line, after which they took a delay of game penalty to give ECU five more yards' room to pin Ohio deep on the punt, but only managed to pin them at their own 16-yard line. On Ohio's next drive, Tettleton rushed for 17 yards on 3rd and 16 to convert for a first down, however on the following series, Tettleton threw another interception; on the return, Ohio committed a personal foul, giving ECU another drive to start in Ohio's territory. Cooper subsequently rushed for a 22-yard touchdown, giving him 198 rushing yards on the day, a career-best. The extra point was blocked, and as such, the game's final score was 37–20.|$|E
25|$|August began explosively for D.C. United, with United {{defeating}} visitors Real Salt Lake {{in a wild}} 6–4 {{shooting gallery}} of a game. As they did the previous weekend at home, United surrendered an extremely early goal, {{this time in the}} second minute. Once again, United also soon gave up another goal, falling behind 2–0 before rallying to victory. Rolfe scored unassisted from about 7 yards before halftime. Chris Rolfe tied the score in the second half, on a penalty kick that set off an incredible spree of goals. Five minutes after Rolfe's penalty kick evened the score, Taylor Kemp put the home team in front with a prodigious one-time strike on a loose ball from about 25 yards. The visitors evened the score only 3 minutes later with a header for goal on a free kick taken by Javier Morales. The tie score lasted about a minute, as Fabian Espindola was credited with a goal as he stretched to try and connect with a loose rebound, following a shot by Alvaro Saborio. RSL defender Justen Glad attempted to clear the loose ball off the line, but his attempted clearance hit Espindola's outstretched leg and the ball crossed the line before the defense could react. Once again, United failed to protect the lead, as RSL's Morales again picked apart the defense and earned his second assist within 6 minutes. This time, the tie score lasted for 11 minutes as Kemp served in a cross after a short corner kick, with Perry Kitchen getting {{on the end of the}} cross, heading it for the game-winning goal, in the 79th minute. Six minutes later, Nick DeLeon knifed through the RSL defense and blasted a long-range shot for an unassisted goal, capping off the 6-4 win. The six goals scored by United were the most the team had scored since a game in 2004, tying the team's all-time record mark. The combined 10 goals were also the most in any MLS game since 2004, a total that had been exceeded only once in league history. The win put D.C. United <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the Supporters Shield standings. Several teams held games in hand and the chance to catch United in that race, but only FC Dallas had earned more points per game played.|$|E

Kershaw only pitched 4 innings and allowed six runs on four hits and three walks. A triple by Bellinger on a line drive that Springer missed on a dive in the seventh inning off of Peacock scored Hernández from first base. In the bottom of the seventh inning, Springer hit a home run off the first pitch in the bottom of the inning off of Morrow, who was pitching for the third consecutive day, to tie the game. Bregman scored on a double by Altuve to put the Astros ahead for the first time in the game, and then Correa hit a two-run home run to extend the lead. Seager doubled in a run in the top of the eighth inning, but McCann hit a home run in the bottom of the inning. That was the 21st home run of the series, tying the record set in the 2002 World Series. Puig broke the record with a two-run home run in the top of the ninth inning. Taylor drove in Barnes to tie the game. With the teams combining to score 24 runs through the first nine innings, this was the highest scoring World Series game since the Florida Marlins beat the Cleveland Indians 14–11 in Game 3 of the 1997 World Series. Bregman singled in pinch runner Derek Fisher for the winning run in the tenth off of Jansen. The Astros became only the second team to come back twice from three runs down in a World Series game. The other were the Toronto Blue Jays in the 15–14 win during Game 4 of the 1993 World Series. This World Series set a new record for most players to hit a home run (14 to date in the World Series).. The 2017 World Series also set a record for the number of players who hit at least one home run Game 5 lasted five hours and seventeen minutes, making it the second longest World Series game in history, trailing only the 14 inning contest between the Astros and the Chicago White Sox in Game 3 of the 2005 World Series and the six game tying home runs in the series to this point is the most for any World Series on record.|$|E
