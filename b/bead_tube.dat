40|$|A {{new method}} {{is able to}} {{circumvent}} the bias to which one commercial DNA extraction method falls prey {{with regard to the}} lysing of certain types of microbial cells, resulting in a truncated spectrum of microbial diversity. By prefacing the protocol with glass-bead-beating agitation (mechanically lysing a much more encompassing array of cell types and spores), the resulting microbial diversity detection is greatly enhanced. In preliminary studies, a commercially available automated DNA extraction method is effective at delivering total DNA yield, but only the non-hardy members of the bacterial bisque were represented in clone libraries, suggesting that this method was ineffective at lysing the hardier cell types. To circumvent such a bias in cells, yet another extraction method was devised. In this technique, samples are first subjected to a stringent bead-beating step, and then are processed via standard protocols. Prior to being loaded into extraction vials, samples are placed in micro-centrifuge <b>bead</b> <b>tubes</b> containing 50 micro-L of commercially produced lysis solution.

30|$|The RNA {{isolation}} protocol {{we developed}} combined steps from conventional Trizol extraction and an RNeasy Micro Elute Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) with some modifications (described below) {{to obtain a}} maximum yield and quality of total RNA. We first spun down antennae in tubes at 13, 000  rpm for 3  min at 4 °C, and then carefully combined antennae from all tubes into 1 MagNA Lyser Green <b>Beads</b> <b>tube</b> (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The tissue was then disrupted in approximately 1  ml Trizol with MagNA Lyser (Roche) at 7, 000  rpm for 15  s each time for 4 or 5 times until the tissue was almost invisible. Between all 15 -s disruptions, we cooled down the lysate on ice for 10  s to prevent RNA degradation. The tissue lysate was transferred from the Green <b>Beads</b> <b>tube</b> to a new RNase-free 1.5  ml tube. Two hundred microliters of chloroform per microliter of tissue lysate {{was added to the}} lysate and well mixed by shaking vigorously for 15  s and was then allowed to sit at room temperature for 2 to 3  min. The aqueous phase was separated by centrifuging the lysate at 13, 000  rpm at 4 °C for 15  min and then carefully transferring to a new 1.5  ml tube. For RNA precipitation, we added 5  μl Carrier RNA working solution (Qiagen) and 1  ml of 70 % EtOH to the aqueous phase and mixed it well by carefully inverting the tubes. To obtain a greater amount of RNA, we kept the samples at − 80 °C overnight to promote RNA precipitation. RNA isolation then followed the manufacture's protocol of the RNeasy Miro Elute Kit (Qiagen) with modifications of an increased volume (700  μl) of RPE buffer and 80 % ethanol to wash the RNA. Genomic DNA was removed by DNase I treatment for 15  min at room temperature. As there is only one major ribosomal RNA peak in Drosophila total RNA, the quality could not be evaluated by an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Instead, we evaluated the quality of total RNA by running 500  ng of total RNA on a 2 % agarose gel.|$|R

The innovative concept introduced by this work is to physically adsorb onto underivatized glass surfaces a functional copolymer, able to graft amino-modified DNA molecules. The polymer, obtained by radical copolymerization of N,Ndimethylacrylamide, N-acryloyloxysuccinimide, and 3 -(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate, copoly(DMA-NASMAPS), self-adsorbs onto the glass surface very quickly, typically in 5 - 30 min. The film, formed on the surface, bears active esters, which react with amino-modified DNA targets. The surface layer is stable in an aqueous buffer containing various additives (SDS, urea, salt), even at boiling temperature. It should be emphasized that the coating is formed by the immersion of glass slides in a diluted aqueous solution of the polymer. Therefore, the procedure is fast, inexpensive, robust, and reliable, and it does not require time-consuming glass pretreatments. Slides, coated with copoly(DMA-NAS-MAPS), were profitably used as substrates for the preparation of low-density DNA microarrays. The density and the thickness of the films were evaluated by X-ray reflectivity measurements whereas the extent of reaction of functional groups with DNA molecules was determined by a functional test.

40|$|Authors: Roey Angel ### Abstract The {{following}} protocol {{is intended}} for the simultaneous extraction of DNA and RNA from various soil samples along with {{suggestions on how to}} tweak the protocol for soil with higher humic content. The protocol has been used by many and results in very high yields of nucleic acids, typically much more than commercial kits. For buffers and solutions used in this protocol, please see accompanying document Buffers and Solutions for TNA Extractions. pdf. ### Introduction This protocol is a general procedure for the co-extraction of DNA and RNA from soils. The procedure results in very high yields of nucleic acids and is suitable for all downstream enzymatic reactions. The protocol has been published in: [Angel et al. 2012]([URL] **NA extraction considerations** - **RNA handling**: as RNA is very sensitive to both chemical and enzymatic degradation meticulous measures of precaution must be taken. The use of DEPC and DEPC-treated water is not recommended since the substance is toxic and its application was found to be nearly unnecessary (see: [URL] Instead, I recommend to simply work with clean, preferably baked, glassware (3 h at 180 °C), to clean surfaces and spatulas with RNase eliminating solutions (such as RNaseZap®), and to use fresh and clean reagents for the preparation of the different buffers and solutions. As a general rule, work with RNA should be quick, precise, and tubes should be kept on ice. In my experience, this is much more important than any attempt to eliminate all RNases from apparatus and solutions. One should also bear in mind that soil samples contain infinitely more RNases than any contamination which might exist in the buffers or the apparatus. The only exceptions to this are the PEG Precipitation Solution, the Low TE Buffer, and the RNA storage solution. Since these are used to store RNA for relatively long periods of incubation extra care must be taken during their preparation to ensure highest degree of purity. For the preparation of the PEG Precipitation Solution I simply weigh everything into a Schott Bottle and add approximately the right amount of water as I prefer to be somewhat inaccurate in the concentrations than to have to transfer the solution between vessels and risk contamination. - **Selection of extraction buffer**: The TNS buffer used in this protocol is based on The TNS extraction buffer is based on the one used by [Henckel et al]([URL] 1999 TNS buffer results in higher RNA yields and more intact rRNA (more intact 23 S band). However, TNS tends to carry much more humic substances into the nucleic acids phase compared to TNC buffer which could make it ineffective for soils with high organic matter content. - **Use of phenol in the bead beating process**: the use of phenol increases the yield up to 4 times compared with the phenol free option, but also increases the carryover of humic substances. If you choose not to add phenol simply double the amount of extraction buffer added (1. 0 ml in total) - **RNAlater®**: if samples were stored in an RNAlater® solution or similar substance it is necessary to remove it before proceeding with RNA extraction. Centrifuge the sample at 10, 000 rpm for 1 min and pipette the supernatant. Add 1 ml of PB pH 8. 0, vortex the sample for 10 s to make sure the soil is washed by the buffer, and centrifuge it again at 10, 000 rpm for 1 min Remove the supernatant completely and proceed with normal extraction. - **Extra dry soil**: for extra dry soil (< 5 % WC) it is recommended to add some (up to 250 µl) PB pH 8. 0 in addition to the usual amount of 375 µl during the first bead beating processing. The reason is that in dry soils some of the extraction buffer is inevitably absorbed in the soil and cannot be recovered afterwards. This can lead to low recovery volumes from the bead beating process which could make it hard to separate the aqueous phase from the phenolic phase and eventually result in reduced yields. After the first processing the soil is wet enough and no further additions are required. - **pH of the extraction buffers**: The phenol and the extraction buffers used in this protocol are all at pH 8. 0. It has been shown that performing the extraction at pH 5. 5 yields significantly fewer humic substances in the extractant and is recommended for soils rich in organic material. Using such low pH, however, will also significantly decrease the amount of DNA yield (while not affecting RNA yield). Low pH extraction might therefore not be suitable if DNA is also to be analysed. For more information see [Mettel et al]([URL] 2010. - **Number of bead beating processing**: for most soil types (especially if they’re not too clayish), one time processing should be sufficient to obtain enough NA for further applications. The following two repetitions are meant not only to increase yields but also to reduce the bias associated with the susceptibility of different cell types to lysis. [Feinstein et al. 2009]([URL] found that DNA extraction yields kept increasing even after the 6 th bead beating repetition, and that community structure differed somewhat in each repetition. - **Amount of crude extract to use for RNA purification**: this depends mostly on the colour of the crude extract, and its quantity and purity as measured spectrophotometrically. In addition, the decision should take into account the final volume of the RNA. Between 20 - 100 µl may be used depending on colour, purity and amount of NA. - **Quantification**: it’s not possible to precisely quantify total NA using a spectrophotometer because DNA and RNA require different multiplication factors, but this should nevertheless give a sensible estimation. More precise quantifications of DNA and RNA can be obtained using Invitrogen’s PicoGreen™ and RiboGreen™, respectively. Impurities, especially humic substances, greatly interfere with spectrophotometeric quantification, though PicoGreen™ and RiboGreen™ tend to be less sensitive. - **Three steps purification procedure**: purification with phenol/chloroform and then chloroform should yield pure enough samples for most applications. Adding an additional purification step with only phenol prior to the phenol/chloroform purification (step 8) will ensure high TNA purity while only minimally compromising the yield. ### Reagents For recipes of the solutions which need to be prepared see: Buffers and Solutions for TNA Extractions. pdf under ‘Figures’. 1. TNS or TNC extraction buffer. - Phosphate buffer (PB) pH 8. 0 or pH 5. 5. - PEG precipitation solution. - Phenol for molecular biology, TE saturated (pH ~ 7. 8). - Phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol 25 : 24 : 1 for molecular biology. - Chloroform/ isoamylalcohol 24 : 1 for molecular biology. - Glycogen (20 mg/ml). - 75 % ethanol made with RNase free water, stored at - 20 °C. ### Equipment 1.

Weigh 0. 5 g (0. 3 - 0. 7 g) soil to a silica <b>beads</b> <b>tube</b> and place tube on ice. - Add 375 µl of PB, 125 µl of TNS or TNC and 500 µl of TE saturated phenol. - Immediately place <b>tubes</b> in a <b>bead</b> beater and process for 30 s at 6. 5 m s- 1. - Chill on ice for 10 s. - Centrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 3 min. - Transfer the supernatant (extraction buffer and the phenolic phase) to a fresh 2 ml tube (or to a Phase Lock Gel tube), retain the silica <b>beads</b> <b>tubes.</b> - Repeat steps 2 - 6 using the same silica <b>beads</b> <b>tubes.</b> If there is not enough space in the tube for all the reagents, decrease the phenol volume (down to 200 µl) to avoid overflow. For the second extraction use fresh 2 ml tubes to collect the supernatant in step 6 while for the third extraction transfer only the aqueous phase and divide it between the tubes from the previous extractions to have equal volumes. - Add approximately 800 µl phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol 25 : 24 : 1 to each of the tubes containing the extractant, 2 ml total volume. - Mix phases by hand or using a vortex. Centrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 3 min. - Transfer the supernatant from each tube to fresh 2 ml tubes, and add 1 vol. chloroform/ isoamylalcohol 24 : 1. Mix phases by hand or using a vortex. Centrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 3 min. - Transfer supernatant from each tube to fresh 2 ml non-stick silicon tubes. - Add to each tube 1 µl of glycogen and 1 ml PEG Precipitation Solution (twice the extractant’s volume). - Centrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 60 min at 4 o C. - Remove as much as possible from the supernatant. Be careful not to pipette the pellet with the liquid. - Wash once with 1 ml of ice cold 75 % EtOH, invert the tube several times. Centrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 20 min. - Remove as much as possible from the supernatant first using a 1 ml tip, spin down the remaining drops in the tube, and remove them with a 100 µl tip. Once again, be careful not to pipette the pellet with the liquid. - Leave tubes open at room temperature for no more than 5 min (preferably under flame or a biological hood) in order to evaporate the remaining ethanol (note: pellets might not be completely dry at this point). Alternatively, pellets can be dried under a filtered stream of N 2. - Resuspend the pellets in 100 µl Low TE Buffer and combine both subsamples from each sample into one of the non-stick tubes. - Optional: to remove colour and some humic substances purify the extract using MicroSpin S- 200 HR (GE Healthcare) the following way: - a.

A 20 x 1. 3 cm piece of glass tubing is stoppered at the lower end with a one-hole rubber stopper fitted with tubing and a clamp. Above this stopper is placed a glass wool plug and above the plug a 1 cm layer of tiny <b>beads.</b> The <b>tube</b> is then filled with NS which is allowed to start dripping from the lower end while the wet-washed DEAE-Sephadex is poured in from the top.

In this method, TruCount, test tubes that contain a known number of brightly fluorescent polystyrene beads are provided by the manufacturer. Whole anticoagulated blood is accurately pipetted into the tubes and mixed with fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies, the erythrocytes are lysed, and this mixture is analyzed on the flow cytometer. Absolute counts of lymphocyte subsets are calculated by determining the ratio of beads to the cell population of interest and then multiplying this ratio {{by the number of}} <b>beads</b> in the <b>tube.</b> We found this method to be reproducible. The values we obtained by the TruCount method were 5 to 10 % higher than those obtained by conventional methods (flow cytometry and automated hematology) used to determine absolute numbers of cells. We believe that these differences are due to the methods of determining absolute cell counts and not to faulty identification of lymphocyte subsets...|$|R

40|$|A {{rapid test}} to {{identify}} patients with {{sickle cell disease}} could have important benefits in low-resource settings. Sickle cell anemia (SCA) affects about 300, 000 newborns each year, the majority of whom are born in sub-Saharan Africa. Low-cost therapies are available to treat SCA, but most countries in sub-Saharan Africa lack robust neonatal screening programs needed to identify patients in need of treatment. To address this need, we developed and evaluated a competitive lateral flow assay that identifies patients with SCA (genotype HbSS) in 15 minutes using undiluted whole blood. A small volume of blood (0. 5 μL- 3 μL) is mixed with antibody-coated blue latex <b>beads</b> in a <b>tube</b> and applied to the strip. Strips are then placed in a well of running buffer and allowed to run for 10 minutes. Laboratory evaluation with samples containing different proportions of hemoglobin A (HbA) and hemoglobin S (HbS) indicated that the test should enable identification of SCA patients but not persons with sickle cell trait (SCT). We evaluated the test using 41 samples from individuals with SCA, SCT, and normal blood. With visual inspection or quantitative analysis, we found a 98 % accuracy when differentiating SCA from normal and SCT samples as a group (90 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity for identifying SCA). This work demonstrates important steps towards making a lateral flow test for hemoglobinopathies more appropriate for point-of-care use; further work is needed before the test is appropriate for clinical use...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Multiwalled carbon {{nanotubes}} (MWNTs) /nylon- 6 (PA 6) nanocomposites {{with different}} MWNTs loadings {{have been prepared}} by the simple melt-compounding approach. A fine and homogeneous dispersion of MWNTs throughout PA 6 matrix is observed by transmission electron microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy observation on the fracture surfaces of the composites shows not only a uniform dispersion of MWNTs but also a strong interfacial adhesion with the matrix, {{as evidenced by the}} presence of many broken but strongly embedded carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the matrix and by the absence of debonding of CNTs from the matrix. Beadlike morphology is also observed along the stretched CNTs and their bundles, probably indicating the anchoring locations of the CNTs defects (within the <b>beads)</b> along the <b>tubes</b> where the PA 6 matrix has strong interfacial interactions with the CNTs, thus being favorable to stress transfer from polymer to CNTs. Mechanical testing (by tensile and nanoindentation tests as well as dynamic mechanical analysis) shows that, compared with neat PA 6, the elastic modulus and the yield strength of the composite are greatly improved by about 214 % and 162 %, respectively, with incorporating only 2 wt % MWNTs. In addition, a unique crystallization and melting behavior of MWNTs/ PA 6 composites are observed and discussed by combining differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction; that is, only the R-form crystals are observed in MWNTs/PA 6 composites, which {{is quite different from the}} case observed in PA 6 /clay nanocomposites...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} {{experiments}} {{and a model}} related to the emission of sound during the flow of granular materials through tubes. Experiments have been conducted using tubes fitted either with pistons or orifice plates at the ends. Earlier workers have observed that the height H of the granular material above the piston or orifice must exceed a critical value $H_c$ for the music to occur. The critical height $H_c$ was determined using the recorded sound signal for flow velocities in the range 0. 4 – 1. 8 mm/s (piston experiments) and 3 – 36. 2 mm/s (orifice experiments). A simple model is constructed by treating the powder column as a spring and slider in series. The slider interacts with the tube wall via a rate and state variable friction law. The model predicts that the material either moves with a constant velocity (steady sliding) or in a jerky manner (stick-slip), depending on the parameter values used. As suggested by earlier workers, we postulate that the silo music is generated by the stickslip motion of granular material. For $H H_c$, the model predicts that steady sliding is unstable with respect to small perturbations. The velocity of the slider exhibits sustained oscillations, which is the expected behavior of a system undergoing stick-slip motion. The model parameters have been estimated by fitting data on the variation of $H_c$ with the flow velocity. The predicted acceleration of the slider is similar in some respects to the data of Muite et al. (Powder Technol. 145 (2004) 190 – 202) for the flow of glass <b>beads</b> in a <b>tube</b> fitted with an orifice. Muite et al. found that the dominant frequency of the sound was given by $c_s / (4 L_a) $, where $c_s$ is speed of sound in air and $L_a$ is {{the length of the}} air column above the granular material.

40|$|Possible large {{applications}} of porous glass membranes {{as a representative}} example of inorganic porous materials attract attention on many researchers [1, 2]. This paper describes the preparation, gas transport characterisation and possible modification of the porous glass membranes. Porous glasses {{can be understood as}} the leaching products of phase-separated alkali borosilicate glasses. The pores that were formed during this process are in a wide range from 0. 3 to 1000 nm in diameter, depending from glass composition and phase separation temperature. They are characterized by large specific surface areas, which are obtained by using standard nitrogen adsorption techniques. Porous glasses show in comparison with other porous inorganic solids high thermal stability, chemical resistance, high optical transparency, and good accessibility to the active sites inside the porous structure. They can be prepared in various geometrical forms i. e. as <b>beads,</b> rods, <b>tubes</b> or plates [2]. This material can be used as membranes for gas separation, as catalytic active membranes or as packing material for HPLC, all of which are influenced by or rely on diffusion. In a wide range of different pore sizes starting from micro- to macro-porous materials, various mechanisms of gas diffusion can be considered: capillary condensation, Knudsen diffusion, surface diffusion, configurational diffusion, viscous flow and molecular diffusion [3]. The meso- and macro-porous membranes are relatively well studied, but in a case of micro-porous membranes the verification of transport mechanism is a very difficult task. The availability of such membranes made it possible to employ a systematic approach of the permeation and adsorption properties. Four ultra thin, flat membranes in a range of pore sizes between 1. 4 nm and 4. 2 nm (1. 4 nm; 2. 3 nm; 3. 1 nm; 4. 2 nm) were selected for the investigation. The dynamic permeability measurements for several gases (He, Ar, N 2, Xe, CO 2 and C 3 H 8) in the temperature range from 293 - 453 K have been studied in a modified Wicke-Kallenbach cell. Additionally, adsorption measurements of these gases are examined by a well-known volumetric technique. The observations of permeability for a membrane with a pore diameter of approximately 4 nm showed the dominance of Knudsen diffusion, what was already confirmed earlier [4]. With decreasing pore diameter, the diffusion is affected by the interaction energy between the gas molecules and the solid surface in the pore. The total flow for the membranes with 2. 3 nm and 3. 1 nm pore diameters is influenced by gas flow described with Knudsen diffusion and surface flow, which is decreasing with increasing temperature. As the pores become smaller (membrane with 1. 4 nm pore diameter), {{it was found that the}} permeability coefficients of different gases are increasing with temperature. The permeation mechanism is changing from Knudsen regime to configurational diffusion. This fact is confirmed with strong correlation between molecular diameters rather than on molecular weight and permeability coefficients [5]. In addition, the resulting selectivity factors between different pairs of investigated gases are high while the Knudsen type of mechanism has an upper limit proportional to the square root of molecular masses. The micro-porous membranes might have a greater potential for gas separation compared to membranes with larger pores, but that does not mean that all problems concerning preparation and modification of porous glasses are solved. An interesting task for the future work is to find the optimal material which could provide a high selectivity without loosing permeability. The modification of the surface with functional groups active for the interesting component is a possible solution. [1] Kuraoka K., Chujo Y., Yazawa T., Journal of Membrane Science 182 (2001) 139.

40|$|In many {{applications}} of cold-rolled steel tubes, {{negative effects of}} residual stresses in the tube material are experienced. For example in tube laser cutting, the residual stresses are gradually relieved during the cutting process, leading to an imprecise geometry of the cut tube. We {{believe that it is}} possible to anticipate on the residual stress effects if their magni-tude and distribution are known. Residual stresses in cold-rolled steel tubes are due to two main sources: (i) the rolling of the flat plate into a circular cross-section and (ii) afterwards closing this section with a weld bead. The first is causing plastic deformation, the second is mainly a non-uniform heating and cooling cycle on the material, preventing the elastic spring-back of the bent material. Focus in this research is on the second step in the produc-tion process: the welding. To reveal the residual stress after welding the tube, a finite element analysis (FEA) of the welding process is performed. This has the advantage that the residual stress/strain state in the tube as a whole is known and can be used further on in cutting simulations. Generally the welding analysis is split up into two parts: first the temperature during the welding is pre-dicted in a thermal analysis, and this temperature field is then used as the input for a me-chanical analysis predicting the stress/strain state during the welding and as the tube is cooled down, the residual stress state in the tube. The simulation is validated by a laboratory setup of the real production process. With this setup it is possible to compare the numerical results with both the experimental tempera-tures, measured with thermocouples, and the experimental strains, measured with the full-field digital image correlation (DIC) technique. In the laboratory environment, abstraction is made of the real production process by setting up the tube statically and using a robot-controlled GTAW torch, putting a weld <b>bead</b> on the <b>tube.</b> The tube under consideration is a stainless steel (AISI 304) tube with a diameter of 60 mm and a thickness of 1. 5 mm. As soon as this work-in-progress is finished, the predicted residual stresses will be checked with residual stresses in finished tubes with the slitting method. Next, to simulate the real welding process, the welding parameters of the real welding process will be adopted. Once the numerically predicted stress/strain state of the tube can be trusted, it should be possible to alter the laser cutting process in such a way that the cut geometry is in agreement with the intended one. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{induction}} {{of calcium}} precipitation via bacterial {{action has been}} studied increasingly in past years for self-(healing/sealing) concrete applications. Several of these studies have presented promising conclusions that microbiologically induced calcite precipitation might be a useful approach for remediation and rehabilitation of shallow cracks on existing structures. Such studies have noted the necessity to encapsulate the ingredients (bacteria, nutrients and organic precursors) separately for self-healing concrete using microbiologically induced calcite precipitation. However, during mixing {{there is a chance}} that capsules or other carriers of self-healing agents may release their cargoes and affect the properties of the concrete. Based on the above-mentioned information, the objective of this research was to evaluate whether or not shallow concrete cracks can be remediated using a bacteria-based system of repair. This research also aims to develop a new bacterial agent for use in the remediation of concrete cracks and to understand the effect of bacterial agents on the properties of cement-based mortar. The scope of this research is diverse; it requires an understanding of the factors that affect durability, water permeability, and cement properties such as initial and final setting time as well as {{the quality and quantity of}} the precipitated materials from the bacteria-based healing/sealing system. This research is broadly divided into four stages. In spite of a number of studies on the mechanism and efficiency of bacterial self-(healing/sealing) concrete, stage one investigates the effect of bacterial self-(healing/sealing) agents on the properties of fresh and hardened concrete. This information is critical for further research and implementation of this novel material. As with any additives, this may have a negative effect on the concrete’s final properties. This will be viewed with skepticism and limited uptake. This stage included the effects of the self-(healing/sealing) agents individually and as a combined medium on the mechanical properties of fresh concrete, the hydration kinetics, and early and final setting times, as well as strength and microstructure development over time. In addition, the effects of self-(healing/sealing) agents on hardened concrete were investigated to determine whether or not capsule rupture in response to a crack would have a detrimental effect on concrete properties in the area surrounding the crack. The results showed that self-(healing/sealing) agents such as sodium citrate greatly influenced hydration kinetics when the concentration exceeded 0. 05 % of the cement mass. Although the self-(healing/sealing) agents at 0. 5 % by binder mass retarded lightly of setting time, they had little negative effect on either 3 - or 28 -day strength. Calcium acetate, the dominant self-(healing/sealing) agent, acts as an accelerator while other components of the medium can have detrimental effects on the properties of fresh and hardened concrete. However, provided the quantity of self-healing/sealing agents released is below a certain threshold, it is unlikely that any detrimental effects will limit the application of bacterial self-healing/sealing concrete. Stage two included applying the main components of the self-sealing agents (calcium lactate and yeast extract) with the ingredients of the mortar mix and as a combined medium with mortar mix (two-stage bio-concrete/mortar) to investigate the ability of B. cohnii, B. halodurans and B. pseudofirmus to induce calcite precipitation through the cracks. The results showed that the sealing materials using each one of the three bacteria with the main components of self-sealing agents were very weak and were not distributed along the crack. Moreover, the primary components of self-sealing agents in 5 % bio-cement mortar of the combined medium by binder mass distributed in entire samples were unable to seal cracks. Results showed that the samples dissolved in water, meaning that with more self-healing agent (SHA- 1) ingredients added to the bio-mortar, the weaker and more ineffective it was with cement. Remediating cracks of hardening concrete with three different types of bacteria (B. cohnii, B. halodurans, and B. pseudofirmus) was performed during Stage three. Factors affecting the quantity and quality of healed materials included start and end healing time, the growth of each bacterium, and the viability of each bacterium in alkaline environment, all of which were also studied experimentally. Results showed that the three bacteria can produce calcium carbonate in a self-healing/sealing process, although B. pseudofirmus is the most suitable, efficient, and economical for remediating concrete cracks. The delivery of bacteria spores inside the concrete environment has always been the most challenging task. The main objective of stage four is to study the possibility of using successful previous delivery system used to remediate concrete cracks by using mineral agent to be used as delivery systems of bacteria spores. This study investigated three different encapsulate techniques within cement mortar namely calcium alginate <b>beads</b> (CAB), vascular <b>tubes,</b> and perlite. Results showed that CAB is very weak and very light due to low density, which cause decrease in their size, floating on the surface of mortar and poor distribution in mortar matrix. In spite of some passive mode effect variables such as tube length and diameter, the viscosity of bacteria solutions and their agents (SHA) and the ability of the glass tube to resist internal stresses were investigated. The results showed there was not enough data to demonstrate its ability to heal cracks. The mechanical and physical properties of uncoated and coated perlite, the ability of perlite to carry bacteria and its SHA, and the ability of bacteria and its SHA to form calcite out of perlite were investigated. The results demonstrated the ability of perlite to inoculate bacteria and its SHA, and the ability of this system to heal cracks. It is clear from the above perlite is the most suitable delivery system...|$|R

The primers for this purpose are designed exactly as described by Splinter et al. (2004). It also is important to establish, by using separate assays, that the interacting regions captured in the 6 C assay are truly occupied by the protein of interest in cells. To this end, perform ChIP assays (Tiwari et al. 2008) using antibodies specific for the protein of interest. The immunoprecipitated DNA can then be amplified using primers spanning the restriction enzyme site found to be involved in the 3 C ligation with other partner(s) in each of the 6 C clones. In early attempts of the 6 C assay (Tiwari et al. 2008), screening the clones by restriction digestion identified a very low frequency of clones having multiple inserts (five out of 352). A number of reasons could account for this. First, the rest of the clones that had a single insert probably represented distinct genomic sites that were bound by the specific protein (in this case, EZH 2) but were not engaged in any long-range associations. Interestingly, this might also reflect the frequency with which certain protein-dependent long-range associations take place in the nucleus. Second, the number of clones with multiple inserts might also be reduced because of difficulty in cloning (i. e., ligation and transformation) or sequencing of large fragments resulting from the ligation fragments generated by a six-cutter restriction enzyme (e. g., EcoRI). Third, intramolecular ligation after cross-linking and digestion will lead to a fraction of the DNA occurring as circular DNA that cannot be cloned; this might further reduce the number of clones in such an assay. Finally, the study could also have missed some interactions involving partners that bear DNA methylation at the EcoRI site (EcoRI is a DNA methylation-sensitive enzyme). Future work should develop strategies to tackle each of these issues to improve the overall efficiency of the method. The 6 C technique can be combined with other recently published techniques to discover all the chromatin regions in the nucleus that are brought in close physical proximity to the gene (or any other chromatin region of interest) in a specific protein-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Following immunoprecipitation with the antibody of interest, the samples can be subjected to 4 C analysis (Zhao et al. 2006) or reverse-cross-linked, purified, digested with a four-cutter enzyme of choice, and processed further for either 3 C-chip (Simonis et al. 2006) or the ACT assay (Ling et al. 2006). The 6 C procedure can also be used to reveal whether two known chromatin regions are brought into close physical proximity by a specific protein by following the amplification criteria used in the original 3 C assay, subsequent to the reversal of cross-linking and purification (Dekker et al. 2002). ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") **Figure 2 **.

Elution, first step of the tandem affinity protocol - Option 1 : Elution by TEV digestion TEV elution is efficient for the FLAG 3 -TEV-HA tag. For the simple FLAG-HA tag, go to option 2 (elution by peptide competition). - Add 50 μl TEV (1 mg/ml). - Incubate for 6 h at 30 °C, using a thermomixer set at 750 rpm. Check that the beads are well mixed, but not harshly, during this incubation. - Option 2 : Elution by peptide competition For proteins fused with a simple FLAG-HA tag, elution is performed by peptide competition. HA peptide (YPYDVPDYA) and FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK) are solubilized at 4 μg/μl in 0. 5 M Tris-HCl (PH 7. 5). - Resuspend the bead pellet in 300 μl TEGN. Transfer into a 500 μl microfuge tube. - Add 100 μl of peptide (4 μg/μl). Use the HA peptide if you started your purification with the anti-HA antibody. - Add protease inhibitors: 8 μl Complete 50 x and 4 μl PMSF 0. 1 M. - Incubate overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. - After TEV digestion or peptide elution, transfer the mixture of beads and elution solution in a centrifuge column (Pierce®, 0. 8 ml, ref. 89868). - Centrifuge 1 min at 8000 rpm at room temperature. - Collect the eluate in a 1. 5 ml microfuge tube, store on ice. Collect also the beads in a separate tube, {{to control the}} efficiency of the elution process. - Take an aliquot of the eluate (e. g. 10 μl) and store on ice. 8. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation: second step of the tandem affinity protocol - Add 40 μl of beads coupled to the second antibody (e. g. anti-FLAG, if you have used the anti-HA in the first step of the protocol) to the eluate of the first purification step, in a 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. - Incubate overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. - Transfer the content of the microfuge <b>tube</b> (<b>beads</b> in suspension) into a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube. - Centrifuge 2 min at 1000 rpm, at 4 °C. - Take an 80 μl aliquot of the unbound fraction of the second IP. Leave on ice until analysis. - Wash 8 times with 10 ml TEGN. - Centrifuge at 4 °C, 2 min at 1000 rpm. - Resuspend in 300 μl (final volume including the beads) TEGN and transfer into a 500 μl microfuge tube. 9. Elution, second step of the tandem affinity protocol - Add 100 μl of competitor peptide (4 μg/μl). - Incubate 5 h at room temperature on a rotating wheel. - Transfer the beads and eluate into a Pierce centrifuge column. - Centrifuge 1 min at 8000 rpm, at room temperature. - Collect the eluate into a 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. This sample contains the chromatin eluted by peptide competition. Store on ice and collect a 40 μl aliquot for western blot analysis. Keep the beads for the second elution step with the SDS elution buffer. - Add 400 μl of preheated (55 °C) SDS elution buffer to the beads. - Agitate during 15 min onto a thermomixer (55 °C). - Transfer (beads+ eluate) in a centrifuge column. - Centrifuge 1 min at 8000 rpm, at room temperature. - Collect the eluate in a 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. This sample corresponds to the second eluate, in which the chromatin remaining attached to the beads after peptide elution has been eluted by the action of SDS. - Take a 40 μl aliquot of eluate 2 and store all samples on ice or until Western blot analysis. 10. Western blot analysis - Run the samples collected at the various steps of the protocol on your favorite protein gel running and blotting system. For the agarose beads collected after the elution steps, directly add the SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer to the beads, heat as for liquid samples, centrifuge 30 s at 13 000 rpm, and load the supernatant onto the gel. The purification efficiency of the tagged protein during the tandem affinity ChIP protocol will be revealed by using an antibody against HA or FLAG epitope. 11. DNA preparation from the purified remodeler-nucleosomes complexes - Add to the eluates 170 μl H 2 O and 20 μl NaCl 5 M. - Incubate overnight at 65 °C for cross-link reversal. - add 10 μl EDTA 0. 5 M, 20 μl Tris-HCl 1 M pH 8. 0 and 4 μl proteinase K 10 mg/ml. Incubate 2 h at 55 °C. - Add 500 μl Phenol/Chloroform, vortex 30 s, and centrifuge 10 min at 13000 rpm, at room temperature. - Collect the aqueous phase and transfer to a new 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. - Add 25 μg of glycogen (Roche, ref. 10901393001) and 50 μl of NaAc 3 M pH 5. 2. Mix. - Add 1 ml 100 % ethanol (- 20 °C), and mix by inverting 10 times the tubes. - Precipitate DNA 1 h at - 20 °C (or overnight at 4 °C). - Centrifuge 15 min at 4 °C, 13000 rpm. The DNA-glycogen pellet should be visible {{at the bottom of the}} tube. - Collect and discard the supernatant. Centrifuge again for 30 s and discard the last drop of liquid. - Wash the DNA-glycogen pellet with 500 μl of 70 % ethanol. Centrifuge and discard all the liquid. - Dry the pellet (15 - 30 min, at room temperature). - Resuspend in 20 μl of H 2 O. This DNA sample will be used for high-throughput sequencing. - Quantify the DNA using a Picogreen DNA detection kit (Invitrogen). ### Timing 3 to 4 days (excluding ES cell culture), depending on the elution option chosen for step 1 ### Author Information Arnaud Depaux, Maud de Dieuleveult, Isabelle Hmitou, Sylvie Jounier, Hélène Humbertclaude & Matthieu Gerard, **Gerard's Lab, mammalian epigenomics** Correspondence to: Matthieu Gerard ([matthieu. gerard@cea. fr](matthieu. gerard@cea. fr)) *Source: [Protocol Exchange]([URL] Originally published online 31 October 2014 *...|$|R
