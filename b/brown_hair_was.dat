25|$|Criswell's decomposing {{body was}} {{located on the}} side of Interstate 10 on November 25, 1987 in Marana, Pima County, Arizona by a {{homeless}} man. She was estimated to have been between seventeen and twenty-one, at a height of around five feet, three inches and a weight of 138 pounds. It was believed that the victim was white or possibly a Hispanic or Native American female with fair skin. The victim's <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> determined to be short and curly. Her eye color could not be determined, as she had begun to decompose after exposure to the hot environment for several days or weeks.|$|E

2500|$|Bryce {{signed his}} then-girlfriend, 20-year-old {{newcomer}} Linda Thorson, {{as the new}} female co-star and chose the name [...] "Tara King" [...] for her character. Thorson played the role with more innocence in mind and at heart; and unlike the previous partnerships with Cathy and Emma, the writers allowed subtle hints of romance to blossom between Steed and King. King also differed from Steed's previous partners in {{that she was a}} fully fledged (albeit initially inexperienced) agent working for Steed's organisation; his previous partners had all been (in the words of the prologue used for American broadcasts of the first Rigg series) talented amateurs. Bryce wanted Tara to be blonde, so Thorson's <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> bleached. However the process badly damaged Thorson's hair, so she had to wear wigs for the first third of her episodes, until her own hair grew back. Her natural <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> not seen until the episode [...] "All Done with Mirrors".|$|E

50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} most common human hair color, after black hair. It varies from light brown to almost black <b>hair.</b> It <b>is</b> {{characterized}} by higher levels of the dark pigment eumelanin and lower levels of the pale pigment pheomelanin. Its strands are thicker than those of fair hair {{but not as much as}} those of red <b>hair.</b> People with <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>are</b> often referred to as brunette, which in French is the feminine form of brunet, the diminutive of brun (brown, brown-haired or dark-haired).|$|R
2500|$|The Girl {{with the}} Dragon Tattoo began {{shooting}} in Sweden in September 2010. Mara {{did not consider}} the film to be a remake, but another interpretation of the novel. [...] "I plan on giving my interpretation of the character," [...] she stated to Variety. Mara's long <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> cut short and dyed black, in a style reminiscent of 1970s punk and 1980s goth fashions. She also had each of her ears pierced four times, and had her brow and right nipple pierced for the role. Her nose and lip piercings were fake. She kept the nipple piercing {{so that it would}} not need to be re-pierced for a sequel. Mara's eyebrows were bleached, and she wore a temporary dragon tattoo. She began preparing for the role by starting to skateboard and kickbox, and underwent dialect and computer training. She also visited Stockholm, the setting of the novel. The film was released on December 20, 2011. Mara received universal critical acclaim and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama for her performance. On January 24, 2012, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.|$|E

6000|$|And {{spinning}} round he saw Phyllis in the doorway. Her light <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> fluffed {{out on her}} shoulders, so that he felt a kind of fainting-sweet sensation, {{and murmured}} inarticulately: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} turned half-way {{down the steps}} and looked up. There was a faint color in her cheeks, and her pretty <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> {{slightly}} disheveled from the hasty removal of the bonnet.|$|E
60|$|Virginia {{raised her}} eyes to the {{painting}} on the wall over the marble mantel. The face under the heavy coils of <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> sweet and gentle, delicately feminine. It had an expression of sorrow that seemed a prophecy.|$|E

60|$|One, high cheek-boned, with coarse, sensuous lips, {{and hair}} elaborately and {{carefully}} powdered; the other pale and thin-lipped, with the keen {{eyes of a}} ferret and a high intellectual forehead, from which the sleek <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> smoothly brushed away.|$|E
60|$|If May Leather {{could not}} speak, she could at all events gaze, {{for she had}} superb brown eyes, and they glittered, just then, like glowing coals, while a wealth of {{rippling}} <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> blown from its fastenings, and flew straight out behind her.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{uttered a}} startled, {{singular}} little cry; everyone looked at her. Her figure was rigid as if paralysed; only her face within its frame of faint <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> alive with an appalling surprise. She stood {{like one of}} a sudden lassooed and throttled.|$|E

60|$|Down Twenty-third street she glided swiftly, {{looking to}} neither side; no more flirtatious than the bronze Diana above the Garden. Her fine <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> neatly braided; her neat waist and unwrinkled black skirt were eloquent {{of the double}} virtues--taste and economy. Ten yards behind {{followed}} the smitten Man from Nome.|$|E
60|$|Her supple maiden {{body was}} {{sheathed}} in a gown of cloth of silver; her <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> dressed into two plaits interlaced with gold threads and set with tiny gems, and these plaits hung one on either breast. Upon the low, white brow a single jewel gleamed--a brilliant {{of the very}} whitest fire.|$|E
60|$|M. de Vilmorin {{tossed his}} long arms to Heaven in disgust. He was a tall, slender young gentleman, {{a year or}} two younger than Andre-Louis.

His neatly clubbed <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> {{innocent}} of powder.|$|E
50|$|Dark <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> {{predominant}} in the Mediterranean {{parts of}} Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, Central Africa and in Southern Africa.

60|$|The pale, oval {{face was}} {{infinitely}} sweet, the slanting eyes of heavenly blue were infinitely tender, the <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> plaited into two long tresses that hung forward upon either breast and were entwined with threads {{of gold and}} shimmering jewels. On the pale brow a brilliant glowed with pure white fires, and her hands were held out to me in welcome.|$|E
60|$|The {{tall man}} bowed. His hazel-coloured eyes were shy, gentle, and deep-set; his eyebrows, hardly ever still, {{gave him a}} look of austere whimsicality. His dark <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> very lightly touched with grey, and a {{frequent}} kindly smile played on his lips. His unmannerised manner was quiet to the point of extinction. He had long, thin, brown hands, and nothing peculiar about his dress.|$|E
60|$|He {{came across}} the room and stood looking down at her thoughtfully. She was wearing a {{somewhat}} daringly fashioned black lace gown, which showed a good deal of her white shoulders and neck. Her <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> simply but artistically arranged.

Brown-haired girls or women are often known as brunette.|$|R
