However, they usually {{get into trouble}} when date are presented in various formats, such as text, voice and image. This study proposes a novel image-encoded forecasting method that input and output <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> two-dimensional (2 D) images are transformed from decimal data. Omitting any data analysis or cleansing steps for simplicity, all raw variables were selected and converted to <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> images as the input of a deep learning model, convolutional neural network (CNN). Using shared weights, pooling and multiple-layer back-propagation techniques, the CNN was adopted to locate the nexus among variations in local <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> images.

40|$|Digital {{images from}} {{computerized}} tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) scanners {{can be used}} to create computer models of anatomical shapes. These models are typically used in biomedical applications for the purpose of physical simulation and visualization. In this thesis, we describe new algorithms for creating models from 2 D and 3 D <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> images. Our models are meshes of 2 D shapes represented by 2 D <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> images, and meshes of the surface of 3 D shapes represented by 3 D <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> images. More specifically, this thesis contains the following two contributions: ^ First, we give an algorithm for converting constrained triangular meshes of polygonal domains into constrained and strictly convex quadrilateral meshes of the same domain. Our algorithm has linear time in the number of triangles of the input triangular mesh, produces a bounded number of quadrilaterals, offers better bounds than similar algorithms that also produce strictly convex quadrilateral meshes of bounded size, and tends to preserve the grading of the input triangular mesh. We also present examples to demonstrate that our algorithm can be successfully used to create quadrilateral meshes from 2 D <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> images of anatomical shapes, such as the human brain. ^ Second, we provide a new algorithm for generating simplicial surface meshes that approximate the boundary of 3 D shapes represented by 3 D <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> images. Our algorithm is based on a simplified version of one of two known algorithms for generating provably good quality simplicial approximations of smooth, implicit surfaces. Provably good quality simplicial surfaces are very desirable for visualization purposes, and the main advantage of our algorithm is to offer this provable quality guarantee. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{an earlier}} paper written for a {{different}} readership [Computers and Graphics 13 (2) (1989) 159 – 166] the first author defined a digital fundamental group—an analog, for <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> pictures, of the fundamental group. In general {{the definition of the}} digital fundamental group involves continuous deformation. But an alternative, discrete, definition of the digital fundamental group was proposed for the strongly normal digital picture spaces defined in the same paper. The above-mentioned paper also defined a “continuous analog” C(P) for each <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> picture P on such a DPS (DPS=digital picture space). C(P) is a polyhedron constructed by “filling in the gaps” between black points (1 's) of the <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> picture P in a specific way. Other kinds of continuous analog had previously been used by the first two authors. In seeking the simplest and most efficient algorithms for performing image processing operations, researchers have considered many different combinations of grids and adjacency relations. Almost all of those combinations are isomorphic to special cases of the concept of a strongly normal DPS. The main contribution of the present paper is a proof that the digital fundamental groups of <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> pictures on a strongly normal DPS are naturally isomorphic to the fundamental groups of the digital pictures' continuous analogs. We use this result to establish that on a strongly normal DPS the discrete and continuous definitions of the digital fundamental group are equivalent, up to a natural group isomorphism. We also show that many topological results which hold in the Euclidean plane or Euclidean 3 -space have analogs that hold in every strongly normal DPS. Our results suggest that a strongly normal DPS is a suitable domain for studying topology-related image processing operations such as thinning, border tracking and contour filling. The definitions of digital fundamental group, strongly normal DPS and continuous analog are included in this paper so as to make it self-contained...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for {{computing}} the Z 2 –cohomology ring of a simplicial complex uniquely associated with a three–dimensional digital binary–valued picture I. <b>Binary</b> <b>digital</b> pictures are represented on the standard grid Z 3, in which all grid points have integer coordinates. Considering a particular 14 –neighbourhood system on this grid, we construct a unique simplicial complex K(I) topologically representing (up to isomorphisms of pictures) the picture I. We then compute the cohomology ring on I via the simplicial complex K(I). The usefulness of a simplicial description of the digital Z 2 –cohomology ring of <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> pictures is tested {{by means of a}} small program visualizing the different steps of our method. Some examples concerning topological thinning, the visualization of representative generators of cohomology classes and the computation of the cup product on the cohomology of simple 3 D digital pictures are showed...|$|R

40|$|We present here a new {{randomized}} algorithm for {{repairing the}} topology of objects represented by 3 D <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> images. By “repairing the topology”, we mean a systematic way of modifying a given binary image {{in order to}} produce a similar binary image which is guaranteed to be well-composed. A 3 D <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> image is said to be well-composed if, and only if, the square faces shared by background and foreground voxels form a 2 D manifold. Well-composed images enjoy some special properties which can make such images very desirable in practical applications. For instance, well-known algorithms for extracting surfaces from and thinning binary images can be simplified and optimized for speed if the input image is assumed to be well-composed. Furthermore, some algorithms for computing surface curvature and extracting adaptive triangulated surfaces, directly from the binary data, can only be applied to well-composed images. Finally, we introduce an extension of the aforementioned algorithm to repairing 3 D digital multivalued images. Such an algorithm finds application in repairing segmented images resulting from multi-object segmentations of other 3 D digital multivalued images...|$|R

40|$|A 3 D <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> {{image is}} said to be well-composed if and only if the set of points in the faces shared by the voxels of {{foreground}} and background points of the image is a 2 D manifold. Well-composed images enjoy important topological and geometric properties; in particular, there is only one type of connected component in any well-composed image, as 6 -, 14 -, 18 -, and 26 -connected components are equal. This implies that several algorithms used in computer vision, computer graphics, and image processing become simpler. For example, thinning algorithms do not suffer from the irreducible thickness problem if the image is well-composed, and the extraction of isosurfaces from well-composed images using the Marching Cubes (MC) algorithm or some of its enhanced variations can be simplified, as only six out of the fourteen canonical cases of cube-isosurface intersection can occur. In this paper, we introduce a new randomized algorithm for making 3 D <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> images that are not well-composed into well-composed ones. We also analyze the complexity and convergence of our algorithm, and present experimental evidence of its effectiveness when faced with practical medical imaging data.
