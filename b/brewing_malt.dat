50|$|The typical British brewer's malt is a well-modified, low-nitrogen barley {{grown in}} the east of England or {{southeast}} of Scotland. In England, the best-known brewer's malt is made from the Maris Otter strain of barley; other common strains are Halcyon, Pipkin, Chariot, and Fanfare. Most malts in current use in Britain are derived from pale malt and were invented no earlier than the reign of Queen Anne. <b>Brewing</b> <b>malt</b> production in Britain is thoroughly industrialized, with barley grown on dedicated land and malts prepared in bulk in large, purpose-build maltings and distributed to brewers {{around the country to}} order.|$|E
5000|$|Henbane {{was one of}} the {{ingredients}} in gruit, traditionally used in beers as a flavouring. Several cities, most notably Pilsen, were named after its German name [...] "Bilsenkraut" [...] in the context of its production for beer flavouring. The recipe for henbane beer includes 40 g dried chopped henbane herbage, 5 g bayberry, 23 l water, 1 l <b>brewing</b> <b>malt,</b> 900 g honey, 5 g dried yeast, and brown sugar. Henbane fell out of usage for beer when it was replaced by hops in the 11th to 16th centuries, as the Bavarian Purity Law of 1516 outlawed ingredients other than barley, hops, yeast, and water.|$|E

The level of antioxidant activity of unfractionated, low-molecular-mass (LMM) and high-molecular-mass (HMM) fractions {{was measured by the}} 2, 2 '-azinobis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfortic acid) radical cation (ABTS(. +)) and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) procedures. Polyphenol levels were assessed by HPLC. The LMM fraction (0. 001) in catechin and ferulic acid levels. Increases in antioxidant activity levels were observed after mashing, boiling, fermentation, chill-lagering, and pasteurization, in line with previous studies on lager. Additionally, increases in the level of antioxidant activity occurred after wort separation and carbonation and bottling and were accompanied by increases in levels of most monitored polyphenols. Data from the ABTS(. -) and FRAP assays indicated that the compounds contributing to the levels of antioxidant activity responded differently in the two procedures. Levels of ferulic, vanillic, and chlorogenic acids and catechin accounted for 45 - 61 % of the variation in antioxidant activity levels...|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteJon FaubionBrewing of beer has a {{long history}} and has evolved over time as tastes, markets and science have progressed. Traditionally malted barley is the grain source used in <b>brewing.</b> <b>Malt</b> {{provides}} a multitude of benefits including: fermentable carbohydrates, nitrogen for yeast metabolism, color compounds, flavor compounds and minor constituents that provide for various qualities in beer such as foam and colloidal stability. There is, however, interest from brewers and drinkers alike for a variety of beer styles. Because of this and other reasons, brewers have worked with adjuncts such as oats, sorghum, wheat, rice, and maize. These grains can be used in unmalted or malted forms, but the incorporation of these grains affects the brewing process and final beer qualities. A review of literature reveals the use of grains other than malted barley reduce the nitrogen contribution and alter the amino acid profile available for yeast metabolism, leading to slower fermentations and variations in the fermentation products resulting in changes to beer flavor. Exceptions include sorghum and oats, which provide a more beneficial amino acid profile than barley despite lower levels of nitrogen when compared to barley. Extract is found to increase when using maize and rice, while oats and sorghum reduce the amount of extract. Wheat has comparable extract to barley. Grains that contribute B-glucans and arabinoxylans will increase viscosity, while grains without these components will reduce viscosity if fermentation is complete. Additionally, most grains will reduce the foam stability due to altered nitrogen and protein contributions; wheat being the lone exception that improves foam stability. This review will discuss the above mentioned attributes and more to explore the changes to be expected when brewing with unmalted and malted grains other than barley...|$|E

40|$|When {{one thinks}} of Utah, beer is {{probably}} not {{the first thing that}} comes to mind. However, despite modern perceptions of alcohol in the state, Utah has a rich history of brewing. In fact, the Becker <b>Brewing</b> and <b>Malting</b> Company of Ogden would become the only Utah brewery, and one of 311 in the entire nation, to survive prohibition. The Becker family built a successful, diversified and strong business model that led their company to profits regardless of wet or dry conditions. Unfortunately, even though the Becker <b>Brewing</b> and <b>Malting</b> Company survived prohibition, they were forced to shut down their operation in 1964. The strong anti-alcohol culture prevalent in Utah, and a series of stringent state liquor laws would appear to be the culprits behind the demise of the Ogden brewery. However, while cultural and legislative factors may have been a hindrance to the Beckers, it was nationwide trends that forced the Company to close its doors. Using research from the Becker <b>Brewing</b> and <b>Malting</b> Company Records at the Utah State Merrill-Cazier Library Special Collections and Archives, this presentation will explore the effects of national brewing industry and cultural trends on 20 th century Utah brewers, by using the Becker <b>Brewing</b> and <b>Malting</b> Company as a case study...|$|R

50|$|Malting is {{the process}} where barley grain is made ready for <b>brewing.</b> <b>Malting</b> is broken down into three steps {{in order to help}} to release the {{starches}} in the barley.

The final part of malting is kilning when the malt goes through a very high temperature drying in a kiln; with gradual temperature increase over several hours.|$|R
