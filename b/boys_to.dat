5|$|After Olander, Williams, and Johnson had recovered, the six musicians {{set to work}} {{on their}} debut album. In doing so, Johnson soon {{discovered}} that the injuries to his hands had altered his dexterity on the mandolin, and threatened to walk away after Powell offhandedly remarked that he would have Roe dub in his own tenor harmonies instead of having Johnson sing them. The band also had commitments to finish as the Tennessee River <b>Boys,</b> <b>to</b> the point that they occasionally had to promote themselves under both names in the same day.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Pierre Messiaen enlisted and Cécile took their two <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> live with her brother in Grenoble. There Messiaen became fascinated with drama, reciting Shakespeare to his brother {{with the help of}} a home-made toy theatre with translucent backdrops made from old cellophane wrappers. At this time he also adopted the Roman Catholic faith. Later, Messiaen felt most at home in the Alps of the Dauphiné, where he had a house built south of Grenoble where he composed most of his music.|$|E
5|$|Eagle Boys {{set up in}} New Zealand in 1996 when Stallone's Pizza owner Gavin Cook {{agreed to}} merge with Eagle <b>Boys</b> <b>to</b> provide an {{established}} base in the South Island. Rapid expansion saw the Eagle Boys chain grow to 54 national outlets in the country by early April 2000. In 2000, all New Zealand stores were sold to Restaurant Brands for NZ$28m and converted to Pizza Hut outlets.|$|E
5|$|Following various {{military}} conquests in the Greek East, Romans adapted {{a number}} of Greek educational precepts to their own fledgling system. They began physical training to prepare the <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> grow as Roman citizens and for eventual recruitment into the army. Conforming to discipline was a point of great emphasis. Girls generally received instruction from their mothers {{in the art of}} spinning, weaving, and sewing.|$|E

5|$|Kan'ami Kiyotsugu {{and his son}} Zeami Motokiyo brought Noh to what is {{essentially}} its present-day form during the Muromachi period (1336 to 1573). Kan'ami was a renowned actor with great versatility fulfilling roles from graceful women and 12-year-old <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> strong adult males. When Kan'ami first presented his work to 17-year-old Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Zeami was a child actor in his play, around age 12. Yoshimitsu {{fell in love with}} Zeami and his position of favor at court caused Noh to be performed frequently for Yoshimitsu thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The England manager {{may also}} involve himself in wider issues beyond the on-the-field team issues. The England manager is {{expected}} to advise the FA on how to approach the complex bidding system that surrounds the arrangement of fixtures for a qualifying campaign. On a more tactical level, {{a host of other}} details can be influenced; Capello is even believed to have instructed the Wembley ball <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> return balls at speed when they go out of play.|$|E
5|$|The three Miller boys played Australian rules {{football}} {{in winter and}} cricket in summer. Their {{father had been a}} successful local cricketer and taught the <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> play with an orthodox and classical technique, relying on a solid defence and concentration in the mould of Bill Ponsford. At the age of seven, Miller's family moved to Elsternwick, in Melbourne's south east. As a child, Miller was small for his age, which forced him to develop his technique rather than rely on power, something that held him in good stead for the future.|$|E

His father, {{the son of a}} coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, a devout Christian, and a Communist Party member. In {{the early years of the}} Second World War, his father was a {{conscientious}} objector who drove an ambulance during the Blitz.|$|E
5|$|When King was a child, he befriended a {{white boy}} whose father owned a {{business}} near his family's home. When {{the boys were}} six, they started school: King had to attend a school for African Americans and the other boy went to one for whites (public schools were among the facilities segregated by state law). King lost his friend because the child's father no longer wanted the <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> play together.|$|E
5|$|A young Serb {{boy from}} the {{vicinity}} of Višegrad is taken from his mother by the Ottomans {{as part of the}} devşirme levy, one of many Christian <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> experience this fate during the Ottoman Empire's 500-year-long occupation of the Balkans. The boy's mother follows her son wailing until she reaches the Drina River, where he is taken across by ferry and she can no longer follow. The young boy is converted to Islam and assigned the Turkish name of Mehmed, becoming known as Mehmed-paša Sokolović. He rises through the Ottoman military ranks and around the age of 60 becomes the Grand Vizier, a position he holds for the next fifteen years. During his time as Grand Vizier, he serves under three sultans and oversees the Ottoman Empire's expansion into Central Europe. He remains haunted by the memory of being forcibly taken from his mother and orders the construction of a bridge at the part of the river where the two became separated.|$|E

5|$|Bánáthy later {{traded for}} milk to give two-year-old Béla and one-year-old László enough protein. As {{extremely}} little food {{was available in}} the camps, in early 1947 his wife's twin sister came from Hungary to take their older two sons back {{to live with the}} older sister. The Pallendal family, Bánáthy's in-laws, was well-educated and relatively wealthy, so they had access to more food than what was available in the camps. They intended to return the Banathy <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> their parents within a year. Beginning in early 1948, when the Cold War ensued, it became virtually impossible for refugees or displaced persons to cross from the border of one country into another, or even from one Occupation Zone to another. The Pallendal family could not return the two boys from behind the Iron Curtain.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{argued for}} girls and <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> have equal {{recreational}} and educational opportunities and for women to have fair wages. Dalton advocated exercise for girls, including swimming and shooting. She believed that women {{had the right to}} suffrage, education, property, control over their earned money, and custody of their children. She was a strong believer in moral temperance and argued that parental hypocrisy caused many children to imitate their parents' actions. She said that it was a woman's religious duty to educate herself. She urged women to take advantage of public resources like libraries and museums, or if time did not permit, to enlarge their minds at Relief Society meetings.|$|E
5|$|Drewett {{emigrated to}} Australia in 1884, causing the <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> be uprooted {{as they went}} to live with Drewett's mother in London. In September of that year, Aurobindo and Manmohan joined St Paul's School there. He learned Greek and spent the last three years reading {{literature}} and English poetry. He also acquired some familiarity with the German and Italian languages and, exposed to the evangelical strictures of Drewett's mother, a distaste for religion. He considered himself at one point to be an atheist but later determined that he was agnostic. A blue plaque unveiled in 2007 commemorates Aurobindo's residence at 49 St Stephen's Avenue in Shepherd's Bush, London, from 1884 to 1887. The three brothers began living in spartan circumstances at the Liberal Club in South Kensington during 1887, their father having experienced some financial difficulties. The Club's secretary was James Cotton, brother of their father's friend in the Bengal ICS, Henry Cotton.|$|E

5|$|During the European {{food crisis}} of the 1840s, food prices rose sharply to around three times the pre-crisis prices, and the {{relatively}} low-paid bal maidens of Devon Great Consols demanded increased pay to cover food costs. While the mine owners initially met their demands, once the food price stabilised the pay rate was then reduced to previous levels causing around 200 bal maidens and <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> walkout. On their return to {{work the next day}} all the striking workers were summarily dismissed and either replaced with new workers, or re-hired at an even lower pay rate than before. Bal maidens went on strike on at least six other occasions in the 19thcentury, but Cornwall's high unemployment meant the strikes were generally unsuccessful as workers could easily be replaced.|$|E
5|$|During the film's production, four of {{the leads}} became romantically involved. Bachchan married Bhaduri four months before filming started. This led to {{shooting}} delays when Bhaduri became pregnant with their daughter Shweta. By {{the time of the}} film's release, she was pregnant with their son Abhishek. Dharmendra had begun wooing Malini during their earlier film Seeta Aur Geeta (1972), and used the location shoot of Sholay to further pursue her. During their romantic scenes, Dharmendra would often pay the light <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> spoil the shot, thereby ensuring many retakes and allowing him {{to spend more time with}} her. The couple married five years after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|Exasperated, Candace {{returns to}} the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for the <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> mistake her for Buford and include her in his act. She is sent flying through {{the roof of the}} tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E
