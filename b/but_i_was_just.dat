Once, in 1945, when General Eisenhower came {{to lay a}} wreath on Franklin's grave, {{the gates of the}} regular {{driveway}} were opened and his automobile approached the house accompanied by the wailing of the sirens of a police escort. When Fala heard the sirens, his legs straightened out, his ears pricked up and I knew that he expected to see his master coming down the drive as he had come so many times. Later, when we were living in the cottage, Fala always lay near the dining-room door where he could watch both entrances just as he did when his master was there. Franklin would often decide suddenly to go somewhere and Fala had to watch both entrances in order to be ready to spring up and join the party on short notice. Fala accepted me after my husband's death, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> someone to put up with until the master should return.|$|E

In later years, Winterburn said of the brawl: [...] "It probably caused a lot of the bad blood between the sides that has lasted for years <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> competitive and desperate to win.

The film met with negative reviews, particularly Oldman's role as a person with dwarfism. According to Dinklage, the original cut of the film was [...] "gorgeous", but the director was fired shortly after turning it in, and the film was re-cut into a [...] "rom-com with dwarves". Speaking on the Oldman controversy, Dinklage said, [...] "There was some flak: Why would you put Gary Oldman on his knees? That's almost like blackface. And I have my own opinions about political correctness, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> like, It's Gary Oldman. He can do whatever he wants, and I'm {{so happy to be}} here." ...|$|E

I wrote a lot during the time I was with them but my first songs were crap. I was {{listening}} to a lot of Irish folk music at the time, so the songs were folky and full of penny whistles and stuff. It was ages before I felt ready to perform my own songs in front of other people." [...] She also credits Parish for teaching her how to perform in front of audiences, saying [...] "after the experience with John's band and seeing him perform I found it was enormously helpful to me as a performer to engage with people in the audience, and I probably did learn that from him, amongst other things." ...|$|E

In June 1997, Schwarzenegger spent $38million of his own money on a private Gulfstream jet. Schwarzenegger once said of his fortune, [...] "Money doesn't make you happy.

2500|$|Vergne's {{right hand}} {{was injured in}} the {{collision}} with Piquet and required an X-ray scan after complaining {{he was unable to}} move it correctly. He was annoyed with Piquet and briefly visited the NextEV garage to know if the latter had also retired. Vergne stated that he would ensure that he was fit for the next race of the season in Paris but felt the incident [...] "destroyed" [...] his race in Monaco. He believed that the crash prevented him from finishing on the podium and chose not to speak to Piquet after the event ended. Piquet was annoyed at Vergne's attempts at overtaking him, labelling him [...] "impatient" [...] and felt he could have been easily passed during the pit stop phase. He thought Vergne would slow down because the latter was unwilling to be overtaken around the outside, and that Vergne had placed himself in that situation, deeming it [...] "unnecessary" [...] but felt it was a [...] "racing incident": [...] "It's a shame, I hate that it happened with him and I hate these kinds of situations. I don't like bad feelings and I'm sure he's very upset and thinks I did it on purpose, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> going to defend my position." [...] Vergne represented the incident as less important six days later by saying he did not regret performing his manoeuvre and it was part of motor racing.|$|E

All his morning hours were spent at his writing, and when he came to Helen he was cold and listless, and talked of nothing but Enid and her troubles. Even as they rode in the park his mind seemed forever revolving lines and scenes. In the midst of her attempt to amuse him, to divert him, he returned to his theme. He invited her judgments and immediately forgot to listen, so morbidly self-centred was he.|$|R
