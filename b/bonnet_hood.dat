5|$|Variety and realism were focuses for the tracks: they {{featured}} visuals such as forests, Neon Cities, and Canyons, {{complete with}} obstacles. The team travelled {{to photograph the}} textures. The tracks were constructed in Softimage 3D and converted to PlayStation format mesh data using a custom tool. In response to a common criticism of the original Destruction Derby, the tracks were designed to be larger and less narrow. The team were inspired by Daytonas revolving windmills, and large jumps were implemented to add drama to the tracks. The most realistic aspect of the race tracks was the pit stop, although Edmondson stated that he limited players to one stop because the team {{did not want to}} detract from the action and because a penalty system would have added a lot of extra work. Cars nearing destruction were designed to behave in a realistic and unpredicatable fashion through effects such as losing the <b>bonnet</b> (<b>hood)</b> and catching on fire.|$|E

2500|$|Aluminium engine cradles and {{suspension}} struts for stretched Lincoln Town Car {{were the}} first automotive parts that were friction stir at Tower Automotive, who use the process also for the engine tunnel of the Ford GT. A spin-off of this company is called Friction Stir Link, Inc. and successfully exploits the FSW process, e.g. for the flatbed trailer [...] "Revolution" [...] of Fontaine Trailers. In Japan FSW is applied to suspension struts at Showa Denko and for joining of aluminium sheets to galvanized steel brackets for the boot (trunk) lid of the Mazda MX-5. Friction stir spot welding is successfully used for the <b>bonnet</b> (<b>hood)</b> and rear doors of the Mazda RX-8 and the boot lid of the Toyota Prius. Wheels are friction stir welded at Simmons Wheels, UT Alloy Works and Fundo. Rear seats for the Volvo V70 are friction stir welded at Sapa, HVAC pistons at Halla Climate Control and exhaust gas recirculation coolers at Pierburg. Tailor welded blanks are friction stir welded for the Audi R8 at Riftec. The B-column of the Audi R8 Spider is friction stir welded from two extrusions at Hammerer Aluminium Industries in Austria.|$|E

5000|$|Chadwick {{had also}} {{had more than}} a dozen non-fiction books published, {{including}} Tractors in New Zealand and Saloon Motorsport in New Zealand. He turned to writing after suffering [...] "artist's block", and his first books featured paintings of the cars they discussed. He also wrote for NZ Classic Car magazine, a local New Zealand newspaper and occasionally New Zealand Truck and Driver magazine. His artwork often had crossovers with his motoring writing, for example, a major series of work created in the late-1980s and early-1990s was painted on second hand car <b>bonnets</b> (<b>hoods).</b> A later work featured Abel Tasman, an Austin Tasman car and the now extinct thylacine (Tasmanian tiger).|$|R

50|$|The revolutionary {{monocoque}} transverse engined {{front wheel}} drive 1959 Austin Mini, that set the template for modern {{front wheel drive}} cars, used front and rear subframes to provide accurate road wheel control while using a stiff lightweight body. The 1961 Jaguar E-type or XKE used a tubular spaceframe type front subframe to mount the engine gearbox and long <b>bonnet</b> / <b>hood,</b> to a monocoque 'tub' passenger compartment.|$|R
5000|$|The GT option used a 390 S code engine {{which was}} a [...] engine with a four-barrel {{carburetor}} and [...] The GT featured car stripes, a fiberglass <b>hood</b> (<b>bonnet)</b> with scoops and several other performance options.|$|R
50|$|The {{prototype}} car was SE492 {{chassis number}} 638, which was modified to add bracing {{to withstand the}} extra power and weight of the four-stroke engine, a taller <b>bonnet</b> (US <b>hood)</b> with large grille to accommodate the engine, and unfaired headlights. In mid-February 1959 this car spent two weeks at the Royal Enfield factory, during which time it covered 500 miles of general road use and 1000 mi of endurance testing at MIRA.|$|R
50|$|The Typ 2K shares 50% of its modules {{with the}} Volkswagen Golf Mk5 and Volkswagen Touran. The new model Caddy {{has a more}} {{aerodynamic}} design, {{the angle of the}} windscreen and A pillar is more horizontal, making the dashboard bigger and the <b>bonnet</b> (<b>hood)</b> smaller.|$|E
50|$|The five-door Avant {{version of}} the C6 RS 6 was {{launched}} in April 2008, and the four-door saloon/sedan was available from August 2008.

50|$|The {{body panels}} were {{largely based on}} the Audi A6 4.2 model, with {{slightly}} flared wheel arches and door sills, with the <b>bonnet</b> (<b>hood)</b> and front wings being constructed from aluminium. Other features included S6 badging, bolstered seats (optional Recaro seats), polished aluminium exterior door mirror housings, unique front grille, and rear bootlid/tailgate spoiler.|$|E
50|$|Where British and American {{vocabulary}} differs, Australians sometimes favour a usage {{different from}} both varieties, as with footpath (for US sidewalk, UK pavement), capsicum (for US bell pepper, UK green/red pepper), or doona (for US comforter, UK duvet). In other instances, it either shares a term with American English, as with truck (UK: lorry) or eggplant (UK: aubergine), or with British English, as with mobile phone (US: cell phone) or <b>bonnet</b> (US: <b>hood).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{torpedo body}} style was {{a type of}} touring body used from the early 20th century until the mid-1920s. A torpedo's <b>hood</b> (<b>bonnet)</b> line was level with the car's waistline, giving a {{straight}} line from front to back.|$|R
50|$|The Ursaab {{design was}} {{improved}} by Sixten Sason in 1947, resulting in another prototype: the 92002. The most remarkable difference between 92001 and 92002 is the <b>hood</b> (<b>bonnet).</b> The earlier <b>hood</b> {{design and the}} use of a hood mechanism from an Opel Kadett made removal of the engine difficult, as one would have to turn it 90 degrees and bring out the drive package with the gearbox first. Inspired by American cars that had cascading front-ends, the redesigned hood allowed for improved access to the engine bay. After an additional four prototypes the design was ready for production as the Saab 92. Ursaab was first shown to the press on June 10, 1947 at Saab AB's headquarters.|$|R
50|$|External changes included: new grilles in {{the front}} bumper to improve the air intake for engine {{compartment}} cooling; a redesigned <b>bonnet</b> (<b>hood)</b> with new lateral air slats to further assist underbonnet ventilation; an adjustable roof spoiler above the tailgate; new five-bolt wheels with the same design of the rally cars; and a new single exhaust pipe.|$|E
50|$|The TS3 {{was used}} in both the Commer and Karrier range of trucks. As the {{horizontal}} cylinders were lower than a vertical engine, the engine was mounted beneath {{the floor of the}} cab. The <b>bonnet</b> (<b>hood)</b> of the truck could be dispensed with, moving the windscreen and driver forward to give one of the first of the now common cab forward trucks.|$|E
5000|$|The Sylva Leader was an {{evolution}} of the Sylva Star retaining the two seater, open top, layout but with improved design features. The two piece fiberglass body consisted of a front hinging <b>bonnet</b> (<b>hood)</b> and low sided passenger compartment. Engine options were Ford Kent Crossflow and Fiat Twin cam engines. Some Sylva Star owners replaced the front with the narrower and more curved Leader front body piece.|$|E
50|$|By late 1948 the 340 {{had been}} {{developed}} to production readiness. It shared the 287 cm wheelbase and central body section of the 326, but the <b>bonnet</b> / <b>hood</b> had been squared off, with the headlights more fully integrated into the front wings. A front grill comprising horizontal metal slats {{in the form of}} an approximate semi triangle followed the contemporary styling trend apparent in other designs including that of the Peugeot 203 launched around the same time as the BMW 340.|$|R
500|$|Commander Caractacus Pott is an {{inventor}} who buys and renovates an old car after gaining money from inventing and selling whistle-like sweets to Lord Skrumshus, the wealthy {{owner of a}} local confectionery factory. The car, a [...] "Paragon Panther", was the sole production of the Paragon motor-car company before it went bankrupt. [...] It is a four-seat touring car with an enormous <b>bonnet,</b> or <b>hood.</b> [...] After the restoration is complete, the car is named for the noises made by its starter motor and the characteristic two loud backfires it makes when it starts.|$|R
50|$|The TR3 {{is a true}} roadster, {{designed}} for sunny weather but with removable rain protection. It has a convertible hood (US top) that snaps on and off and removable side curtains, allowing very low doors with padding for the driver's arm to rest on. There are holes in the floor, with rubber plugs, so that the originally supplied jack might be used from inside the car, as did the Jaguar XK120. The optional heater is poor and the shut-off valve is under the <b>bonnet</b> (US <b>hood).</b> A third person can be carried behind the seats.|$|R
50|$|The car {{was based}} on the XB Falcon 500 Hardtop and {{featured}} a 302 in³ (4.9 L) Cleveland V8, and some specific options including the GS Rally Pack which featured full dash instrumentation, a 3-spoke steering wheel, vented <b>bonnet</b> (<b>hood)</b> with locking pins, and 12-slot steel road wheels. A separate item featured on all John Goss Special hardtops were the cosmetic side body vents that were also a feature of contemporary Falcon GT hardtops.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: 1959 Commer truck {{designed}} to take the [...] "flat" [...] TS3 engine with its horizontally mounted cylinders. With the engine mounted beneath {{the floor of the}} cab, the <b>bonnet</b> (<b>hood)</b> of the truck could be dispensed with. The windscreen and driver were then moved {{to the front of the}} vehicle, resulting in the UK's first short-cab lorry, with a cab forward design that avoided the excessive height of the tilt-cab Bedford QL.|$|E
5000|$|The {{front of}} the car {{included}} an unusual design feature called the [...] "Serviceklappe" [...] in German — this translates to [...] "service hatch" [...] or [...] "service panel". On early cars, this was a glossy black panel at the lower edge of the <b>bonnet</b> (<b>hood),</b> where the radiator grille would normally be sited. Behind it are the filling points for oil and screen wash fluid and the dipstick. Thanks to these features, the bonnet {{does not need to be}} raised often.|$|E
50|$|Mechanically {{they were}} {{identical}} to the Class 03, with the same 24 litre Gardner engine, 5-speed epicyclic gearbox and the same overall layout. They had a straight <b>bonnet</b> (US: <b>hood)</b> from the front to the rear-mounted cab, unlike the 03s which bulged higher towards the rear (over the larger fuel tank), and the cab's rounded roof met the sides at an angle instead of with a curve as in the 03, with a lip all the way round. The internal cab layout was almost symmetrical to allow the driver to work from either side as required.|$|R
60|$|When Tess {{had changed}} her <b>bonnet</b> for a <b>hood,</b> and was really on her stool under the cow, and the milk was {{squirting}} from her fists into the pail, she appeared to feel that she really had laid a new foundation for her future. The conviction bred serenity, her pulse slowed, {{and she was able}} to look about her.|$|R
50|$|Straight-eight engines {{were used}} in {{expensive}} luxury and performance vehicles until after World War II. Bugattis and Duesenbergs commonly used double overhead cam straight-eight engines. Other notable straight-eight-powered automobiles were built by Daimler, Mercedes-Benz, Isotta-Fraschini, Alfa Romeo, Stutz, Stearns-Knight and Packard. One marketing feature of these engines was their impressive length — some of the Duesenberg engines were over 4 ft long, resulting in the long <b>hoods</b> (<b>bonnets)</b> found on these automobiles.|$|R
