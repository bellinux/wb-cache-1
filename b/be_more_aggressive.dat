5|$|A study, using stuffed bird models, {{found that}} small birds {{are less likely}} to {{approach}} common cuckoos (a brood parasite) which have barred underparts like the Eurasian sparrowhawk. Eurasian reed warblers were found to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> to cuckoos which looked less hawk-like, meaning that the resemblance to the hawk helps the cuckoo to access the nests of potential hosts.|$|E
5|$|A {{field study}} {{conducted}} in winter 1978 on Kangaroo Island found red wattlebirds to be territorial around {{a rich source}} of nectar, namely a large cup gum (Eucalyptus cosmophylla), driving off smaller honeyeaters. This indicated the species would exclude other species if food was scarce. In New England National Park, red wattlebirds would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> if there were moderate amounts of nectar in groves of flowering banksias but less so at lean or abundant times.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are easily}} {{distinguished}} from males {{as they have}} a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller cere and nostrils, more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not {{very different from that}} of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. They tend to resist more and <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> than the male when handled. Nesting females also have a brood patch on the bare skin of the belly.|$|E

5|$|Given its {{formidable}} {{size and}} dentition, the silky shark {{is regarded as}} potentially dangerous to humans. However, it only rarely comes into contact with people due to its oceanic habits. Its natural curiosity and boldness may lead it to repeatedly and closely approach divers, and it can become dangerously excited {{in the presence of}} food. The silky shark tends to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> if encountered on a reef than in open water. Cases of individual sharks persistently harassing divers and even forcing them out of the water have been reported. As of May 2009, the International Shark Attack File lists six attacks attributable to the silky shark, three of them unprovoked and none fatal.|$|E
5|$|His style {{began to}} be {{directed}} during his midget years with Allaire and Montreal-Bourassa goaltending coach Mario Baril. Luongo sent tapes of his play to Allaire during his rookie season in the QMJHL and his former goaltending coach advised him to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> and {{come out of the}} net more to cut off angles and challenge shooters. Later in his NHL career, the Canucks hired a new goaltending coach, Roland Melanson, prior to the 2010–11 season. Working with Melanson, Luongo began playing deeper in his crease against Allaire's original advice, allowing him to maintain positioning for rebounds. The following season, Melanson further tweaked Luongo's style, encouraging him to extend and elevate his glove after his hand's usual low positioning was interpreted to have become a weakness.|$|E
5|$|Reported to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> {{than other}} stingarees, the sparsely-spotted stingaree readily employs its venomous sting if {{disturbed}} and can inflict a painful injury on a human. It is edible, but seldom brought to market. Fishing pressure is insignificant across {{large portions of}} this ray's range, including in the Great Australian Bight, though substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial fisheries off southeastern and southwestern Australia in beach seines and bottom trawls. The sparsely-spotted stingaree generally survives being captured, sorted, and discarded, though the process often causes it to abort any unborn young. Nevertheless, losses to fisheries appear to be sustainable at present, and thus the IUCN has listed this species under Least Concern. There {{are a number of}} small Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) within its range, and it would potentially benefit from the implementation of the 2004 Australian National Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} the {{regiment}} returned to their previous task of flank protection. At midday the 3rd and 11th Squadrons were located along the ridge south-east of El Buggar, forcing the Turkish observation posts to retire. The day was almost {{a replica of the}} previous one and the regiment was back at Shellal at 21:30. Instead of resting overnight, they moved to El Mendur, arriving there at 06:00 on 19 April. The division was now required to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive,</b> to draw the Turkish forces towards them, {{because of the lack of}} progress by the force attacking Gaza. The 3rd Squadron was detailed as a guard force for the division's artillery, accompanying them to Atawineh. The squadron moved into the front line, losing one dead and seventeen wounded by the time it withdrew at 20:00. The rest of the regiment was held in reserve, having two men wounded during an aircraft attack. By the end of the day, the second attempt to take Gaza was called off, the defences being to strong for a frontal assault.|$|E
5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} often curious about divers {{when they first}} enter the water and may {{approach}} quite closely, though they lose interest on repeat dives. They can become dangerous {{in the presence of}} food, and tend to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> if encountered in open water rather than on the reef. There have been several known attacks on spearfishers, possibly by mistake, when the shark struck at the speared fish close to the diver. This species will also attack if pursued or cornered, and divers should immediately retreat (slowly and always facing the shark) if it begins to perform a threat display. Photographing the display should not be attempted, as the flash from a camera is known to have incited at least one attack. Although of modest size, they are capable of inflicting significant damage: during one study of the threat display, a grey reef shark attacked the researchers' submersible multiple times, leaving tooth marks in the plastic windows and biting off one of the propellers. The shark consistently launched its attacks from a distance of , which it was able to cover in a third of a second. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed seven unprovoked and six provoked attacks (none of them fatal) attributable to this species.|$|E

25|$|The main French (and Israeli) battle tank, the AMX-13, was {{designed}} for mobile, outflanking operations, {{which led to a}} tank that was lightly armoured but very fast. General André Beaufre, who served as Stockwell's subordinate, favoured a swift campaign of movement in which the main objective was to encircle the enemy. Throughout the operation, Beaufre proved himself to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> than his British counterparts, always urging that some bold step be taken at once. The French Navy had a powerful carrier force which was excellent for projecting power inland, but, like its British counterpart, suffered from a lack of landing craft.|$|E

25|$|Pain and {{discomfort}} also increase aggression. Even {{the simple act}} of placing one's hands in hot water can cause an aggressive response. Hot temperatures have been implicated as a factor in a number of studies. One study completed {{in the midst of the}} civil rights movement found that riots were more likely on hotter days than cooler ones (Carlsmith & Anderson 1979). Students were found to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> and irritable after taking a test in a hot classroom (Anderson et al. 1996, Rule, et al. 1987). Drivers in cars without air conditioning were also found to be more likely to honk their horns (Kenrick & MacFarlane 1986), which is used as a measure of aggression and has shown links to other factors such as generic symbols of aggression or the visibility of other drivers.|$|E
25|$|Religion {{played a}} large part in the {{politics}} of this period, and even tolerance had its limits faced with the incompatible demands of both camps. As the Archduke closest to the Turkish threat, Maximilian II was to continue his father's policy of tolerance and reconciliation, granting Assekuration (legalisation of Protestanism for the nobles) in 1571, as did Charles II with Religionspazifikation in 1572, while in distant Tyrol, Ferdinand II could afford to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive.</b> Maximilian II's policies were continued by his sons, Rudolf V and Mathias. The strength of the Reformation in Upper Austria was blunted by internal schisms, while in Lower Austria Melchior Khlesl led a vigorous Catholic response, expelling Protestant preachers and promoting reconvertion. A further concession by Charles II in 1578, the Brucker Pazifikation, met with more resistance.|$|E
