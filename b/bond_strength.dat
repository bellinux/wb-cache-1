The formation of intermetallic compounds in the Al/Mg system reduced the <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> dramatically. In Cu/Cu and Ni-Cu, diffusion bonds developed at lower temperatures as Ni-Cu forms an isomorphous system, which increased the <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> effectively.

25|$|The {{triple bond}} {{is very strong}} with a <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> of 839 kJ/mol. The sigma bond {{contributes}} 369kJ/mol, the first pi bond contributes 268kJ/mol and the second pi-bond of 202kJ/mol <b>bond</b> <b>strength.</b> Bonding usually discussed {{in the context of}} molecular orbital theory, which recognizes the triple bond as arising from overlap of s and p orbitals. In the language of valence bond theory, the carbon atoms in an alkyne bond are sp hybridized: they each have two unhybridized p orbitals and two sp hybrid orbitals. Overlap of an sp orbital from each atom forms one sp–sp sigma bond. Each p orbital on one atom overlaps one on the other atom, forming two pi bonds, giving a total of three bonds. The remaining sp orbital on each atom can form a sigma bond to another atom, for example to hydrogen atoms in the parent acetylene. The two sp orbitals project {{on opposite sides of the}} carbon atom.|$|E
25|$|Tetrafluoromethane, {{also known}} as carbon tetrafluoride, is the {{simplest}} fluorocarbon (CF4). It has a very high <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> {{due to the nature}} of the carbon–fluorine bond. It can also be classified as a haloalkane or halomethane. Because of the multiple carbon–fluorine bonds, and the high electronegativity of fluorine, the carbon in tetrafluoromethane has a significant positive partial charge which strengthens and shortens the four carbon–fluorine bonds by providing additional ionic character. Tetrafluoromethane is a potent greenhouse gas.|$|E

In this study, the surfaces of zirconia (fiber) posts were treated by mechanical and/or chemical methods such as sandblasting and silanization. The <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> between the zirconia (fiber) post and the resin cement was measured by a push-out method after thermocycling based on the adhesion to Panavia F 2. 0 resin cement. The zirconia and fiber posts exhibited different <b>bonding</b> <b>strengths</b> after sandblasting and/or silanization because of the different strengths and chemical structures. The zirconia post showed a high <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> of up to 17. 1 MPa after a combined treatment of sandblasting and silanization because of the rough surface and covalent bonds at the interface. This effect was also enhanced by using 1, 2 -bis(trimethoxysilyl) ethane for the formation of a flexible layer at the interface. In contrast, a high <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> of 13. 9 MPa was obtained for the fiber post treated by silane agents because the sandblasting treatment resulted in damage to the fiber post, as observed by scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that the improvement in the <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> between the post and the resin cement could be controlled by different chemical and/or mechanical treatments. Enhanced <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> depended on covalent bonding and the surface roughness. A zirconia post with high <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> could potentially be used for the restoration of teeth in the future...|$|R

50|$|Atoms with {{non-bonding}} valence electrons, i.e., with lone pairs, {{have more}} flexibility in their <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> than those without lone pairs {{depending on whether the}} lone pairs are stereoactive or not. If the lone pairs are not stereoactive, they are spread uniformly around the valence shell, if they are stereoactive they are concentrated in one portion of the coordination sphere preventing that portion from forming bonds. This results in the atom having a smaller coordination number, hence a higher <b>bonding</b> <b>strength,</b> when the lone pair is stereoactive. Ions with lone pairs have a greater ability to adapt their <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> to match that of the counter-ion.

25|$|An {{association}} {{energy of}} 22-25kJ/mol {{is typical of}} charge-induced dipole interactions, {{and so there is}} interest in the use of charged linkers and metals. The metal–hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> is diminished in MOFs, probably due to charge diffusion, so 2+ and 3+ metal ions are being studied to strengthen this interaction even further. A problem with this approach is that MOFs with exposed metal surfaces have lower concentrations of linkers; this makes them difficult to synthesize, as they are prone to framework collapse. This may diminish their useful lifetimes as well. Most common strategies to increase this binding energy for MOFs and molecular hydrogen have been reviewed.|$|E
25|$|Mayonnaise {{can be made}} by {{hand with}} a whisk, or fork, or with the aid of an {{electric}} mixer or blender. It is made by slowly adding oil to an egg yolk, while whisking vigorously to disperse the oil. The oil and the water in the yolk form a base of the emulsion, while lecithin and protein from the yolk is the emulsifier that stabilizes it. A combination of van der Waals interactions and electrostatic repulsion determine the <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> among oil droplets. The high viscosity of mayonnaise is attributed to the total strength created by these two intermolecular forces. Addition of mustard contributes to the taste and further stabilizes the emulsion, as mustard contains small amounts of lecithin. If vinegar is added directly to the yolk, it can emulsify more oil, thus making more mayonnaise.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor that}} {{contributes}} to the ability of an acid to lose a proton is the strength of the bond between the acidic hydrogen and the atom that bears it. This, in turn, is dependent {{on the size of the}} atoms sharing the bond. For an acid HA, as the size of atom A increases, the strength of the bond decreases, meaning that it is more easily broken, and the strength of the acid increases. <b>Bond</b> <b>strength</b> is a measure of how much energy it takes to break a bond. In other words, it takes less energy to break the bond as atom A grows larger, and the proton is more easily removed by a base. This partially explains why hydrofluoric acid is considered a weak acid, while the other hydrohalic acids (HCl, HBr, HI) are strong acids. Although fluorine is more electronegative than the other halogens, its atomic radius is also much smaller, so it shares a stronger bond with hydrogen. Moving down a column on the periodic table, atoms become less electronegative but also significantly larger, and the size of the atom tends to dominate its acidity when sharing a bond to hydrogen. Hydrogen sulfide, H2S, is a stronger acid than water, even though oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur. Just as with the halogens, this is because sulfur is larger than oxygen and the H—S bond is more easily broken than the H—O bond.|$|E
