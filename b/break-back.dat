25|$|Haigh {{began with}} Yorkshire as a fast bowler with a {{difficult}} slower ball. Using such methods, {{combined with the}} <b>break-back,</b> Haigh was seen in 1896 as the hard-wicket bowler Yorkshire were looking for. He took 84 wickets for just over 15 runs each, and took 8 for 78 on a good wicket against the Australians.|$|E
25|$|Field had no pretensions to be a batsman, but at {{his best}} was a bowler of {{considerable}} pace and capable of a sharp <b>break-back</b> on a worn pitch, as was shown most clearly in Warwickshire's crucial win against Yorkshire at Harrogate in 1911, when he took 7 for 20 to bowl Yorkshire out for 58.|$|E
25|$|He bowled {{right-hand}} medium pace, {{but could}} vary it with slower or faster deliveries, {{and when the}} pitch helped him he made the ball spin back from the off. The usefulness of Haigh's <b>break-back</b> saw over 74 per cent of his wickets taken without assistance from fieldsmen – the highest of any bowler with over 500 wickets.|$|E
25|$|Spofforth, {{having taken}} seven for 44 in this innings (making it {{fourteen}} for ninety in the match), bowled his last eleven overs for two runs and four wickets, those two runs and four wickets coming off his last seven deliveries. He was carried shoulder-high from the field. His <b>break-backs</b> {{had been almost}} unplayable on this wicket; indeed, Giffen believed that {{every single one of}} them would have destroyed the stumps had not the bat got in the way.|$|R
2500|$|Spofforth {{presently}} claimed Ulyett, and Boyle had Grace {{caught by}} Bannerman at mid-off, making it 53 for four. Now, amidst great tension, Lucas and Lyttleton played out twelve maiden overs in succession. [...] "Suddenly", wrote C. P. Moody (the man famous for compiling the first accepted list of Test Matches), [...] "a new phase {{came over the}} innings. The batsmen could not get the ball past fieldsmen. Spofforth was bowling the most remarkable <b>break-backs</b> at tremendous pace; Boyle, from the other end, maintained a perfect length; Blackham with matchless skill took every ball that passed the batsmen ... every fieldsman strained his nerves to the utmost." [...] It was now that Spofforth suggested to his captain Murdoch that they allow the batsmen to change ends. Alec Bannerman deliberately misfielded a stroke from Lyttleton, allowing the batsmen to take a single and end the monotony. [...] "Something {{of the spirit of}} the struggle", wrote Moody, [...] "pervaded the thousands of spectators, and their oppressive silence was punctuated by a mighty shout when Lyttleton broke the spell with a single." [...] This meant that Spofforth could now have a go at him. After four more runless overs, Spofforth knocked over Lyttleton's stumps. That made it 66 for five, England needing nineteen more to win.|$|R
25|$|Cuttell {{was a slow}} right-arm bowler who {{possessed the}} unusual ability to turn the ball from leg without {{throwing}} it up enough to encourage risk-taking batsmen to attack him.

He fully embraced Yorkshire's hard-edged competitiveness in the early 1920s: he questioned the decisions of umpires and sledged opposing batsmen, {{both of which were}} unusual at the time. His Times obituary noted that some disagreements came because Waddington played to win and was an enthusiastic appealer, although he was unlikely to win many appeals for leg before wicket because of the angle at which he bowled. Anthony Woodhouse, the cricket historian, describes Waddington as a [...] "wild and irresponsible...quick-tempered individual". But there was another side to his personality; he was a good talker and liked to wear smart clothes, including monogrammed silk shirts. Sutcliffe, a close friend and teammate of Waddington, called him [...] "a genial fellow in the dressing room; a man with a rare personality, proof of which is shown by the fact that whenever there was a discussion of any kind in the dressing room, Abe generally ruled it, to all intents and purposes, the chairman." [...] The cricket writer Jim Kilburn wrote that [...] "at his best, [...] was a magnificently hostile bowler {{with one of the most}} beautiful actions ever seen in cricket, and his pace and <b>break-back</b> were a problem for the greatest of batsmen".

2500|$|Tom Richardson (11 August 1870 [...] 2 July 1912) was an English cricketer. A [...] fast bowler, Richardson relied to a {{great extent}} on the <b>break-back</b> (a fast ball moving from off to leg), a {{relatively}} long run-up and high arm which allowed him to gain sharp lift on fast pitches even from the full, straight length he always bowled. He played 358 first-class cricket matches and 14 Tests, taking a total of 2,104 wickets. In the four consecutive seasons from 1894 to 1897 he took 1,005 wickets, a figure surpassed over such a period only by the slow bowler A.P. Freeman. He took 290 wickets in 1895, again a figure only exceeded by Freeman (twice). In 1963 Neville Cardus selected him as one of his [...] "Six Giants of the Wisden Century".|$|E

The score rose to 51 for two, with Grace and Ulyett hitting out strongly. Spofforth changed ends, and Neville Cardus wrote thus of this move: [...] "Now I was behind his arm; I could see his superb <b>break-back.</b> And he bowled mainly medium pace at this time. With each off-break I could see his right hand, {{at the end of}} the swing over, finish near the left side, 'cutting' under the ball. Sometimes his arm went straight over and continued straight down in the follow-through – and then the batsmen had to tackle fierce topspin. There was the sense of the inimical in his aspect now. He seemed taller than he was half an hour ago, the right arm more sinuous. There was no excitement in him he was ... cold-blooded." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1899, {{with the}} decline of Attewell, saw John Gunn {{establish}} himself as Nottinghamshire's chief bowler, though he faded late in the season. 1900, however, saw him and Thomas Wass restore Nottinghamshire's bowling to reasonable strength {{for the first time}} since the early 1890s. He took eleven wickets for the Players against the Gentlemen at the Oval. He also advanced as a batsman with six scores of over fifty, and the following season, though he never played a bigger innings than 87, scored 1,000 runs for the first time and bowled, considering the unfavourable pitches, exceedingly well. In those days Gunn was a left hand medium pace bowler who relied on the ball that went in from off to leg, which allowed him to nag away at batsmen very well on good pitches but could not <b>break-back</b> on a sticky wicket like Rhodes, Blythe, Briggs or Hargreave. It was because of this that Gunn was chosen for the Ashes tour of 1901/1902 when Yorkshire refused to let Rhodes go – apparently because they feared it would affect his performance the following season.|$|E

5000|$|The South Pyrenean Zone {{consists}} of a Mesozoic-Eocene sedimentary sequence which has detached from the Axial Zone within evaporitic horizons of the Middle or Upper Triassic and consequently was transported southward. The basement of this sequence does not outcrop. The southward motion was [...] "channelised" [...] by two major conjugated faults, in the west by the more or less north-south-trending folds and thrusts near the Cinca river (Mediano and Boltaña anticlines), and in the east by the northeast-southwest-trending en echelon wrench faults at the Segre river. At the latter, the thrust system forms a <b>break-back</b> (hindward-thrusting) imbricate emergent fan which developed during the latest Eocene and early Oligocene.

40|$|Slant range {{analysis}} of radar altimeter {{data from the}} Seasat, Geosat, ERS- 1 and ERS- 2 databases are used to determine barrier location at particular times, and estimate barrier motion (km/yr) for major Antarctic ice shelves. The barrier locations, which are the seaward edges or fronts of floating ice shelves, advance with time as the ice flows from the grounded ice sheets and retreat whenever icebergs calve from the fronts. The analysis covers various multiyear intervals from 1978 to 1998, supplemented by barrier location maps produced elsewhere for 1977 and 1986. Barrier motion is estimated as the ratio between mean annual ice shelf area change for a particular interval, {{and the length of}} the discharge periphery. This value is positive if the barrier location progresses seaward, or negative if the barrier location regresses (<b>break-back).</b> Either positive or negative values are lower limit estimates because the method does not detect relatively small area changes due to calving or surge events.

40|$|Abstract Field trials {{involving}} seventy rural households {{from three}} villages in Mozambique were estab-lished {{to test whether}} intensive daily trapping inside household-level food stores could effectively reduce rodent pest populations. The main species caught inside dwellings where food was stored were Rattus rattus [alexandrinus], comprising 74. 3 % of rodents caught over the year, followed by Mastomys natalensis (20. 1 %) and Saccostomus campestris (5. 6 %). Baseline surveys showed that households using 10 <b>break-back</b> traps caught an average of 1. 2 ± 0. 37 rats/day (mean ± sem). Annual trials whereby half of the selected dwellings in each village continuously trapped every day with 10 traps were able {{to reduce the number}} of rodents in their houses by 50 – 70 % compared to the non-treatment group of farmers who only trapped for three days every eight weeks.

40|$|Lethal spring traps {{are widely}} used for killing small mammals in the UK. Many require {{government}} approval, based primarily on humaneness. However, mole traps and <b>break-back</b> traps for rats and mice are exempt; those available vary widely in price and apparent quality. The EU is considering implementing a Trapping Directive that would alter UK legislation, and a recent report advised the EU that trapping legislation should cover all trapped species and encourage improvement of traps. Mechanical trap performance is often used {{as an indicator of}} welfare impact. We examined the mechanical evidence for scope to improve the welfare standards of rat, mouse and mole spring traps. We measured mechanical performance among a range of rat, mouse and mole traps. Impact momentum values varied 6 - 8 fold, and clamping force values 4 - 5. 5 fold, among traps for killing each species. There was considerable overlap in the performance of rat and mouse traps. Trap-opening angle and spring type were related to impact momentum and clamping force in traps for both species. There was no relationship between price and mechanical performance in traps for any species, except talpa mole traps. We are unable to judge the direct welfare impact of the traps tested, but rather the potential welfare threat associated with their exemption from approval.

40|$|Spring traps require welfare {{approval}} in the UK, but <b>break-back</b> traps, for rats and mice, and mole traps are exempt. Mechanical tests {{on a wide}} range of these unregulated traps showed that impact momentum varied 6 - 8 -fold, and clamping force varied 4 - 5. 5 -fold, among traps for use with each of rats, mice and moles. There was considerable overlap between the strongest mouse traps and weakest rat traps for each force. A post-mortem and x-ray study of 50 spring-trapped moles revealed that none sustained damaged skulls or cervical vertebrae; they were, therefore, unlikely to have become unconscious immediately. Some moles appeared superficially to have broken spines, but in fact they had incurred only soft tissue damage and no broken vertebrae. The primary identifiable cause of death in trapped moles was acute haemorrhage. A minority of moles may have asphyxiated, but evidence for this was weak. Given the scale of rat, mouse and mole trapping in the UK, the wide range of unregulated traps available, and doubts raised regarding their humaneness, this research suggests an urgent imperative to abandon a puzzling double standard, and thereby to reduce the welfare impact of unregulated spring traps for rats, mice and moles. There is a strong case that all traps should be subjected to comparable approval standards. In the meantime, we propose a Voluntary Trap Approval (VTA) scheme under which manufacturers would submit traps for approval testing in the same way as for regulated traps. All approved traps could be given a certification mark and trap suppliers might choose to sell only approved traps, thus edging non-approved traps out of the market...|$|E
40|$|The Skellefte {{district}} in northern Sweden is a Palaeoproterozoic volcanic arc hosting abundant volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits. The dominating {{rocks in the}} district are submarine volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of the Skellefte Group deposited in an extensional regime at 1. 89 – 1. 88 Ga. Structural analysis and facies analysis combined with reflection seismic investigations in {{the central part of}} the Skellefte district revealed a pronounced pattern of WNW–ESE-striking normal faults and NE–SW-striking transfer faults that developed synchronously with volcanic activity. Dextral strike-slip movement along regional-scale NE-SW-striking faults favoured the opening of a pull-apart system. VMS deposits formed as sub-seafloor replacement and partly exhalative deposits mainly in the uppermost parts of Skellefte Group but also in the lowermost parts of the overlying Vargfors Group. Furthermore, the VMS deposits show a close spatial relationship to faults indicating that the ore-forming hydrothermal fluids utilized the synextensional faults as fluid conduits. The Vargfors Group sedimentary rocks form a distinct sub-basin in the central Skellefte district, the so called Vargfors basin or Vargfors syncline. Syn-extensional faulting created fault-bound compartments within the Vargfors basin. Syn-tectonic sedimentation of the Vargfors Group within the sub-basin is responsible for changes in stratigraphy between the individual compartments. Progressive opening of the sub-basin from the centre towards north-west and south-east is evident from the change of sedimentary facies associations. The onset of Vargfors Group deposition is characterized by turbiditic sedimentation with intercalated sandstones and monomict conglomerates derived from eroded and/or reworked Skellefte Group volcanic rocks. These facies associations are unconformably overlain by polymict conglomerates of alluvial fan and braided systems caused by the uplift of the Jörn intrusive complex and the subsequent formation of the Arvidsjaur volcanic arc, respectively. It is unclear if the polymict series formed during the latest stages of crustal extension or at the onset of subsequent crustal shortening. Crustal shortening at around 1. 87 Ga is attributed to basin inversion and accretionary processes at the Svecokarelian craton margin and is assumed to result in inversion of normal and transfer faults and the formation of upright, fault-bound syn- and anticlines. A rheologically weak carbonate-rich layer at the base of the sedimentary sequence is suggested to favour the fault inversion over more distributed shortening as the controlling deformation mechanism in the Vargfors syncline. Furthermore, VMS deposits were transposed along the faults, and the deformation style of the ore bodies generally mimics the deformation styles of the hosting high-strain zones. Moreover, the size of the VMS deposits is coupled to the size of the associated high-strain zone with large-tonnage deposits associated with regional-scale high-strain zones and their splays. Progressive crustal shortening led to the formation of N-dipping <b>break-back</b> and shortcut faults. Mafic volcanic rocks are commonly observed along early, inverted faults and later <b>break-back</b> and short-cut faults indicating a long history of mafic volcanic activity both during extension and crustal shortening in the central Skellefte district. Three-dimensional geological multi-scale modelling combined results from geological and geophysical investigations in order to visualise the crustal architecture in the Skellefte district. Modelling was carried out in different scales ranging from detailed deposit-scale models of 21 VMS ore bodies to a semi-regional scale model of the Vargfors syncline and a simplified regional scale model of the central Skellefte district.

Unexpected results from a recent infill drilling and water injection led to {{a review of the}} geological model.   Data from over 800 feet of outcrop, 928 feet of cores from five wells, 21 new biostratigraphic analysis from cores, dipmeter and wireline logs from 35 wells, 5 check-shot and a 36 km 2 seismic cube were interpreted and integrated to define a new reservoir model. Sedimentological studies indicate that the reservoir section was deposited in a well oxygenated, current-swept, shallow-marine shelf as agradational tidally influenced cycles, as progradational shorefaces and as tidal bars and channels. High-resolution sequence stratigraphic subdivision of the reservoir allows identification of repeated sections in several wells. Dipmeter data shows low to very high dip angles within the oil-bearing reservoir and confirms the location of low-angle thrust faults, interpreted from well log correlations. The Tello field consists of 5 thrust sheets arranged as a series of partly overlapping ramp anticlines with high-angle dipping backlimbs and low-angle forelimbs. Structural horses involve mostly Monserrate strata. Siliceous siltstones in the Lower Monserrate and Upper Villeta formations act as detachment surfaces for these thrusts. The three easternmost sheets form an antiformal stack that shares the same trailing branch point. Although the roof sequence has been eroded by the Miocene unconformity, the small vertical offset (forelimb against the footwall flat) at the lowest fault-bend indicates that the "Roof sequence" was nearby. By the contrary, the western thrust faults cut the roof sequence as the <b>break-back</b> sequence of deformation occurred. These events are the result of cumulative episodes of deformation and thrust reactivation. Folding of the unconformity and the Miocene strata and the better preservation of the Monserrate strata in the structurally high positions f the field supports reactivation of the westernmost faults. Integration of multiple data sets lead to a reinterpretation of the stratigraphic and structural models that results in better reservoir modeling and planning and recognition of undrilled potential of the Tello field. Estimated new additional oil reserves are about 18 MMBbls. The last 7 wells honored the new reservoir model and daily oil production has increased 80 %. EI Campo Tello, localizado en el Valle Superior del Magdalena, ha producido aproximadamente 60 millones de barriles de aceite durante 26 años. En estudios anteriores, la sección productora del campo era interpretada como areniscas fluviales del Mioceno Temprano que suprayacen la discordancia del Oligoceno. Se asumía la zona productora como horizontal y la ausencia de arenas era interpretada como cambios laterales de facies a lodolitas. Con el objetivo de diseñar un plan de desarrollo para el campo se decidió reevaluar los modelos geológico y de yacimientos con todos los datos disponibles. Esta revisión condujo a modificaciones muy importantes en los modelos y en la estrategia de desarrollo del campo.   En el área de Geología, estudios sedimentológicos indican que la sección productora fue depositada en una plataforma marina somera inyección de agua. Con estos proyectos se estima incrementar las reservas recuperables de aceite en aproximadamente 26 millones de barriles. A Diciembre de 2000 se obtuvieron tasas promedio de más de 14. 000 BAPD (barriles de aceite por día). 9000 barriles más de lo que producía el campo al inicio de este estudio...|$|E
