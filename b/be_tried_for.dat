5|$|Since {{this case}} {{challenged}} {{the authority of}} the federal courts to try Indian-on-Indian crime, this case was heard as an interlocutory appeal, meaning that the Supreme Court would have to decide the constitutionality of the claimed jurisdiction before Kagama could <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>for</b> the killing of Iyouse in federal court.|$|E

5|$|Speer {{was taken}} to several {{internment}} centres for Nazi officials and interrogated. In September1945, {{he was told that}} he would <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>for</b> war crimes, and several days later, he {{was taken to}} Nuremberg and incarcerated there. Speer was indicted on all four possible counts: first, participating in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of crime against peace; second, planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace; third, war crimes; and lastly, crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|These three Native American {{leaders were}} the first to <b>be</b> <b>tried,</b> <b>for</b> raids (Warren Wagon Train Raid) and murder, in a United States civil court instead of a {{military}} court. This would deny them any vestige of rights as prisoners of war by being tried as any common criminal in the Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District of Texas in Jacksboro, Texas near Fort Richardson.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, No. 6 Commando {{remained}} in Germany to undertake various occupation duties {{along with the rest}} of the 1st Commando Brigade. These duties included searching for German personnel and officials that were wanted for questioning or to <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>for</b> war crimes, distributing food to the populace and helping to restore law and order as part of the reconstruction process. In early 1946, the unit returned to the United Kingdom and it was eventually disbanded. At this time the decision was made to disband all the Army commando units and demobilise or return their personnel to their original regiments or branches of service. Consequently, the commando role was maintained solely by the Royal Marines Commandos, although they too were subjected to cut backs, being reduced from eight wartime units to just three.|$|E

5|$|Late {{that night}} the generals held a council of war in which Floyd and Pillow {{expressed}} satisfaction with {{the events of the}} day, but Buckner convinced them that they had little realistic chance to hold the fort or escape from Grant's army, which was receiving steady reinforcements. General Floyd, concerned he would <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>for</b> treason if captured by the North, sought Buckner's assurance that he would be given time to escape with some of his Virginia regiments before the army surrendered. Buckner agreed and Floyd offered to turn over command to his subordinate, Pillow. Pillow immediately declined and passed command to Buckner, who agreed to stay behind and surrender. Both Generals Floyd and Pillow left to leave General Buckner to surrender to the Union Forces. Pillow and Floyd were able to escape, as did cavalry commander Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest.|$|E
5|$|Use of {{insanity}} {{as a concept}} dates from 1324, and its criminal application was used until the late 16th century in an almost identical way. The defence, if successful, either allowed the defendant to return home or led to him being incarcerated until he was granted a royal pardon; after 1542, a defendant who became insane prior to the trial could not <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>for</b> any crime, {{up to and including}} high treason. During the 18th century the test to determine insanity became extremely narrow, with defendants required to prove that they could not distinguish between good and evil and that they suffered from a mental disease which made them incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions. The current wording comes from the M'Naghten Rules, based on the trial of Daniel M'Naghten in 1843.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, the ministers were {{not out of}} the spotlight. Since the ministers were inferior to the King within the executive branch, the King was responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, the ministers were responsible for the advice given to the King when they were assembled in the Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. The King was above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>for</b> Impeachment for advising the King to act out an unconstitutional veto. The Impeachment Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the latter group held a two-thirds majority, an Impeachment trial with a fairly certain outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E

5|$|As with {{previous}} codes, Han law distinguished {{what should be}} considered murderous killings (with malice and foresight), wittingly killing, killing by mistake, and killing by accident. Although a father was the undisputed head of the family, he {{was not allowed to}} mutilate or kill any of its members as punishment; if he did, he would <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>for</b> physical assault or murder, respectively. Yet not all murders were given the same sentence, since relation and circumstance were considered in the sentencing. For example, A father would be given a much less severe sentence for murdering a son than if a son murdered his father. Women had certain rights under Han law. It was against the law for husbands to physically abuse their wives. Rape cases were also commonly filed in court and were punished by Han law. Women could level charges against men in court, while it was commonly accepted in Han jurisprudence that women were capable of telling the truth in court.|$|E
5|$|Close to the Peary, the Aurora {{receives}} an indistinct distress call from another ship and alters its course to help, but inquiries by Tintin expose that the distress signal is a decoy to delay them. Resuming the journey, they intercept a cable announcing that the Peary expedition {{has reached the}} meteorite but not yet claimed it. While the Peary crew rows to the meteorite, Tintin uses the Auroras seaplane to parachute onto the meteorite and plant the expedition's flag. Tintin makes camp while the Auroras engines are repaired after developing trouble. The next day he discovers that Phostlite accelerates growth, and makes things much larger: his apple core grows into a large tree while a maggot grows into a huge butterfly, and Tintin is menaced by a giant spider that escaped from his lunch box, and immense, explosive mushrooms before rescue arrives. A sudden seaquake shakes the meteorite to its core and it sinks into the sea, just as Tintin and Snowy escape to the Aurora {{with a piece of}} Phostlite. Thereafter Bohlwinkel learns that he is expected to <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>for</b> his crimes. As the Aurora returns home, Captain Haddock steers the ship toward land to refuel not with oil, but with whiskey.|$|E
