5|$|At {{its peak}} of popularity, the Large Black was used mainly for meat production, {{especially}} bacon. The {{meat from the}} Large Black {{is known for its}} lean quality and flavour without an excess of <b>back</b> <b>fat,</b> but for commercial production it was often crossed with the Yorkshire and Middle White pigs, producing a vigorous hybrid that was well regarded by farmers. However, today commercial processors do not favour the black skin of the purebred Large Black.|$|E
500|$|He {{released}} goalkeeper Brian Horne, who {{he described}} as a [...] "fat slob"; this {{proved to be an}} unpopular move with [...] "a lot of nasty people who support Hartlepool... who purport to support this club [...] would rather <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> professional players than people who really care about Hartlepool United". As his replacement he signed Stephen Pears from Liverpool, as well as young defenders Glen Davies and Chris McDonald, teenage winger David Clegg, Exeter City midfielder Mark Cooper, and Blackpool midfielder Chris Beech. Hartlepool started the 1996–97 campaign with wins over Colchester United and Fulham, but his playing career came to an end after the fifth game of the season, against Wigan Athletic, when he retired due to a persistent knee injury. He continued to bemoan refereeing decisions which seemed to consistently go against Hartlepool. This in turn led to continued punishments from the FA over his use of foul language towards officials. With his team on a poor run of results {{at the foot of the}} table, he left the club by mutual consent on 4 November 1996. His assistant Mick Tait led the club to a 20th-place finish, and organised a benefit match for Houchen against Middlesbrough, which raised £23,000.|$|E

40|$|Caveolins have {{important}} roles {{in the organization of}} detergent-insoluble lipid rafts, trafficking of cholesterol and anchoring of signaling molecules. In this study, the expression patterns of Caveolin- 1 (Cav- 1), Caveolin- 2 (Cav- 2) and Caveolin 3 (Cav- 3) genes were investigated in the longissimus dorsi muscle and <b>back</b> subcutaneous <b>fat</b> of Berkshire and Yacha pigs at the age of 6 months using quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that Cav- 1 and - 2 mRNA were abundantly expressed in <b>back</b> subcutaneous <b>fat.</b> The expression patterns of Cav- 1 and - 2 were similar in the two pig breeds. The expression levels in the <b>back</b> subcutaneous <b>fat</b> were significantly higher in Yacha pigs than in Berkshire pigs (p< 0. 01). Cav- 3 was expressed predominantly in the longissimus dorsi muscle and the Berkshire pig had higher Cav- 3 mRNA levels compared with the Yacha pig (p< 0. 01). These results indicate that the mRNAs of Cav family genes exhibit specific expression changes between Berkshire and Yacha pigs. The data contributes to the elucidation of the relationship between meat quality and Cav family genes expression and provides a basis for further study on the mutual regulation mechanism of Cav family genes...|$|R

50|$|Fermented pork <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> {{that is used}} to make salami {{has very}} high {{saturated}} fatty acid and cholesterol content, which can increase {{the risk of heart disease}} and pancreatitis. However, it has been shown that it is possible to replace the pork <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> in salami with extra virgin olive oil thereby changing the fatty acid profile of the salami. Olive oil consists of a much larger amount of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which allows this substitution to create a healthier product. Salami is considered slightly acidic due to lactic acid that is present. In salami where the pork <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> was substituted for extra virgin olive oil, it has shown to have a lower pH of around 5.00 compared to its original levels of around 6.35 to 6.55 making the salami more acidic. These lower pH levels are healthier for humans as higher populations of lactic acid bacteria inhibit the spread of spoilage microorganisms.There have also been cases that have showcased some of the possible health dangers of salami. An outbreak of Escherichia coli O157 infection of a husband and wife was traced back to the consumption of dry fermented salami made with pork meat after the couple was hospitalized for bloody diarrhea. There was also an outbreak of E. coli O157 in 1994 with 17 cases all occurring from the consumption of pre-sliced salami that was processed by one company. A research investigation of the factory where the salami was processed found that all processing techniques and production methods complied with all regulations and there was no evidence of contamination after processing.|$|E

50|$|Lountza is {{made from}} the pork tenderloin. After the initial brining and marinading in wine, it is smoked. Although it can be aged, many prefer younger, milder lountza. It is often cooked over coals or fried with eggs {{to act as a}} {{sandwich}} filler or as part of a meze. Stronger than lountza and made from the leg, is chiromeri, which is similar to any smoked, air-dried ham from Southern Europe, although the wine flavour makes it characteristically Cypriot. In non-mountain areas, the same meat used for chiromeri is cut into strips along the muscle compartments and dried in the sun as basta. The shoulder of a freshly slaughtered animal is cut into chunks about the size of an almond along with a smaller quantity of chopped <b>back</b> <b>fat,</b> which are marinated in wine and brined, stuffed into intestines, and smoked as sausages (loukaniko).|$|E
