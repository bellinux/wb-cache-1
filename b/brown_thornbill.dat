5000|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>thornbills</b> are skilled mimics {{and also}} respond to humans imitating their calls. The calls have been {{described}} as [...] "rich, musical warble". Adult <b>brown</b> <b>thornbills</b> are able to mimic the alarm calls of other birds such as the New Holland honeyeater that warn of a raptor approaching, which deters other predators such as pied currawongs from attacking their nests.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{techniques}} for recognizing individuals in avian field research is marking birds with plastic and metal leg rings. However, in some species individuals may react negatively to rings, causing leg injuries and, in extreme cases, {{the loss of a}} foot or limb. Here, we report problems that arise from ringing and illustrate solutions based on field data from <b>Brown</b> <b>Thornbills</b> (Acanthiza pusilla) (2 populations), Siberian Jays (Perisoreus infaustus) and Purple-crowned Fairy-wrens (Malurus coronatus). We encountered three problems caused by plastic rings: inflammations triggered by material accumulating under the ring (Purple-crowned Fairy-wrens), contact inflammations as a consequence of plastic rings touching the foot or tibio-tarsal joint (<b>Brown</b> <b>Thornbills),</b> and toes or the foot getting trapped in partly unwrapped flat-band colour rings (Siberian Jays). Metal rings caused two problems: the edges of aluminium rings bent inwards if mounted {{on top of each other}} (<b>Brown</b> <b>Thornbills),</b> and too small a ring size led to inflammation (Purple-crowned Fairy-wrens). We overcame these problems by changing the ringing technique (using different ring types or larger rings), or using different adhesive. Additionally, we developed and tested a novel, simple technique of gluing plastic rings onto metal rings in <b>Brown</b> <b>Thornbills.</b> A review of studies reporting ring injuries (N = 23) showed that small birds (, 55 g body weight) are more pron...|$|R

5000|$|The inland thornbill (Acanthiza apicalis), {{commonly}} called the broad-tailed thornbill, is a small, insect-eating bird of Australia. The Inland Thornbill is commonly {{confused with the}} coastal <b>brown</b> <b>thornbill</b> (Acanthiza pusilla) due to its similar colorations. The inland thornbill encompasses four subspecies: ...|$|E
5|$|Self-incompatible, Acacia pycnantha cannot {{fertilise}} {{itself and}} requires cross-pollination between plants to set seed. Birds facilitate this and field experiments keeping birds away from flowers greatly reduces seed production. Nectaries {{are located on}} phyllodes; those near open flowers become active, producing nectar that birds feed upon just before or during flowering. While feeding, birds brush against the flower heads and dislodge pollen and often visit multiple trees. Several species of honeyeater, including the white-naped, yellow-faced, New Holland, and occasionally white-plumed and crescent honeyeaters, and Eastern spinebills have been observed foraging. Other bird species include the silvereye, striated, buff-rumped and <b>brown</b> <b>thornbills.</b> As well as eating nectar, birds often pick off insects on the foliage. Honeybees, native bees, ants and flies also visit nectaries, but generally do not {{come into contact with}} the flowers during this activity. The presence of Acacia pycnantha is positively correlated with numbers of swift parrots overwintering in box–ironbark forest in central Victoria, though {{it is not clear whether}} the parrots are feeding on them or some other factor is at play.|$|R
50|$|Plants {{found in}} the reserve include 107 species of tree, 30 herbs, 50 vines, 3 palms, 21 species of fungi and 26 kinds of shrubs. Animals include 139 birds {{including}} the wompoo fruit-dove, <b>brown</b> cuckoo-dove, tree-creepers, <b>thornbills,</b> scrub-wrens, green catbird as well as 11 different marsupials, 3 bats, 20 lizards, 14 snakes and 14 frog species.|$|R
50|$|They {{are found}} {{primarily}} in Australia {{and have a}} thin long beak. Colloquially the thornbill is {{sometimes referred to as}} a “tit” by locals, but in reality the Australian continent lacks any true tits, albeit Acanthiza species do show some similarities with tits in their behavior. They have a similar role as small insect-eating birds with titmice and kinglets. Like tits, Thornbills live in small groups foraging amidst trees and shrubs, and feed in a similar manner. Cooperative breeding is recorded from most species except the <b>brown</b> and Tasmanian <b>thornbills.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>thornbill</b> {{is mainly}} an insectivore. However, it may {{sometimes}} eat seeds, fruit, or nectar. They mostly feed relatively {{close to the}} ground, in trees and in the understorey. It often feeds in groups with other thornbills, except during the breeding season.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>thornbill</b> (Acanthiza pusilla) is a {{passerine}} bird {{usually found}} in eastern and south-eastern Australia, including Tasmania. It can {{grow up to}} 10 cm long, and feeds on insects. [...] It is brown, gray, and white. The species has five subspecies.|$|E
50|$|They are gregarious {{and rarely}} seen singly. Feeding flocks are usually small parties {{of up to}} ten, and less often up to 20 birds, associating with <b>brown</b> <b>thornbill</b> (A. pusilla), yellow-rumped thornbill (A. chrysorrhoa), {{southern}} whiteface (Aphelocephala leucopsis), white-browed scrubwrens (Sericornis frontalis) or redthroats (Pyrrholaemus brunneus), and occasionally joined by silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis).|$|E
50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>thornbill</b> couples tend to {{last for}} a long time. Their nests are built out of grasses, bark, and {{feathers}} or plant down. A clutch consists of two to four eggs, with three eggs being the most common. They incubate for 19 days and have a nesting period of 16 days. Their breeding season ranges from July to January.|$|E
50|$|Slight {{geographic}} variations, {{birds of}} the more arid inland are paler and greyer above, with a slightly paler rump patch and cleaner white below than those in coastal and subcoastal regions. May be confused with rufous birds with rufous-brown rump patch such as <b>brown</b> <b>thornbill</b> (A. pusilla), inland thornbill (A. apicalis) and slaty-backed thornbills (A. robustirostris).|$|E
50|$|King Island, {{located at}} the western {{entrance}} to Bass Strait, {{is home to a}} range of native plants and animals, some of which are under threat of extinction. Plant species under threat include, but are not restricted to, native orchids and ferns, whilst the animal species include the locally endemic threatened birds, the King Island <b>Brown</b> <b>Thornbill</b> (Acanthiza pusilla archibaldi) and King Island Scrubtit (Acanthornis magna greeniana) amongst others.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>thornbill</b> can {{be found}} in the eastern and southeastern parts of Australia, {{including}} Tasmania. It is usually found within 300 km of the coast. It shares a substantial part of its range in the Great Dividing Range and the Mt Lofty Ranges with the inland thornbill. It is also common in the Blue Mountains. The subspecies Acanthiza pusilla pusilla and the subspecies Acanthiza pusilla diemenensis have been observed near the Australian Capital Territory and on Tasmania, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The thornbill can {{be found}} {{throughout}} Australia inland of the Great Dividing Range, but not in tropical northern climates or in Tasmania. The inland thornbill overlaps in range with the <b>brown</b> <b>thornbill</b> along the Great Dividing Range, leading to numerous mis-sightings. Inland thornbills live in dry scrublands and woodlands. In Southwestern Australia, they also inhabit sand heaths and karri and jarrah forests. It feeds on small insects and spiders, and occasionally seeds and small vegetable matter, beneath shrubs and in foliage.|$|E
50|$|The reserve {{provides}} {{habitat for}} many birds and other animals, including the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot, the extremely rare King Island subspecies of the <b>brown</b> <b>thornbill,</b> and the Southern Hairy Red Snail. Short-tailed shearwaters have colonies in the dunes behind Lavinia Beach while fairy terns nest {{on the sand}} spit {{at the mouth of}} the Sea Elephant River. Hooded plovers and pied oystercatchers nest on the beaches. The marshy grassland surrounding the estuary is home to the only known Tasmanian population of the golden-headed cisticola.|$|E
50|$|The red-necked crake (Rallina tricolor), {{previously}} thought to only occur {{as far south}} as Townsville, was first observed in the park in 1981. The buff-breasted paradise kingfisher (Tanysiptera sylvia) and the white-browed robin (Poecilodryas superciliosa) are at the southern extent of their distribution at Eungella.The regent bowerbird (Sericulus chrysocephalus) occurs at its northern limit in the park and surrounding area. as does the <b>brown</b> <b>thornbill</b> (Acanthisa pusilla) and the glossy black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus lathami).Grey swiftlets (also known as Australian swiftlets) (Aerodramus terraereginea) breed in caves in the Finch Hatton Creek area, and glossy swiftlets (Collocalia esculenta) are also found in the park.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>thornbill</b> is {{a member}} of the order Passeriformes, the family Acanthizidae, and the genus Acanthiza.

The species was first {{described}} by George Shaw in 1790. The subspecies Acanthiza pusilla pusilla was described by Shaw in 1790 and the subspecies Acanthiza pusilla diemenensis was first described by John Gould in 1838. Acanthiza pusilla zietzi was described by Alfred John North in 1904, Acanthiza pusilla dawsonensis was described by Archibald George Campbell in 1922, and Acanthiza pusilla archibaldi was described by Gregory Mathews in 1910.|$|E
5000|$|A {{protected}} {{nature conservation}} area {{was created by}} the local government council from land purchased between 1999 and 2010. Located in the north-west of the suburb, the 196 ha nature refuge consists of the former Cornubia Forest Park to the south and land known as the Cornubia Escarpment in the north. It is managed as part of Australia’s National Reserve System with objectives that include both conservation of flora and fauna, and recreation such as bushwalking and mountain bike riding. The refuge is also managed under a Koala Nature Refuge Agreement with the state government. The tall open forest ecosystem of blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) and the <b>brown</b> <b>thornbill</b> (Acanthiza pusilla) in the area are described as endangered.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the larger}} mammals, Bennett's {{wallabies}} and wombats are common, and are regularly {{seen in the}} ski village during summer and winter, even under blizzard conditions. Pademelons are abundant in the wet gullies and areas with thick undergrowth. Forester kangaroos have been recorded along the south-west edge of the park. Eastern quolls inhabit the ski village during winter, and are sometimes sighted during daylight hours. Dusky antechinus occasionally visit lodges. The echidna has been recorded and the platypus has been sighted in the Upper Ford River. Various other species, including the long-nosed potoroo, Tasmanian bettong, brushtail possum, ringtail possum, sugar glider, native rodents such as the velvet-furred rat and the long-tailed mouse, and six species of bat have all been recorded in the park. Among the birds, no systematic study has been made. Wedge-tailed eagles are regularly reported, as is the noisy yellow-tailed black cockatoo. Among the endemic species recorded are the green rosella, scrubtit, <b>brown</b> <b>thornbill,</b> yellow wattlebird, yellow-throated honeyeater, black-headed honeyeater, strong-billed honeyeater and the black currawong. Little is known of the reptiles from Ben Lomond. Of particular interest is the endemic northern snow skink Niveoscincus greeni which is an alpine species restricted to several other mountain top areas in the State. Amphibians recorded from Ben Lomond include the brown tree frog, common eastern froglet and the endemic Tasmanian froglet.|$|E
40|$|Acanthiza pusilla and A. lineata {{often occur}} together, but {{striated}} thornbill forages {{mainly in the}} subcanopy and canopy (> 75 % of foraging observations) where it specialises in taking food from the foliage of eucalypts (> 90 % of observations). <b>Brown</b> <b>thornbill</b> forages mainly in the shrub layer (> 70 % of observations) and takes prey from bark, debris and the leaves of a large variety of plants including eucalypts. Both thornbills forage mainly by gleaning but striated thornbill commonly hang gleans (> 20 % of observations), a behaviour rarely used by brown thornbills. Striated thornbills are disadvantaged by logging, which reduces the amount of canopy and subcanopy vegetation, but brown thornbills benefit from the increased amount of shrub and ground vegetation that results. Conversely, brown thornbills are adversely affected by fires that {{reduce the amount of}} debris and low vegetation. In the absence of eucalypts, striated thornbills are absent from pine plantations, but brown thornbills may be abundant...|$|E
40|$|I {{examined}} age {{effects on}} reproduction in the <b>Brown</b> <b>Thornbill</b> Acanthiza pusilla in Canberra, Australia. I found that the reproductive performance of {{both males and females}} improved with age, although only age-related improvement in male performance had a significant effect on annual reproductive success. Reproductive success improved with male age as a result of improved performance during two stages of the breeding cycle: first-year males were less likely to fledge young than those aged two or more, while both first and second-year males were less successful at raising fledglings to independence than males of three or more. Male performance appears to improve over three years as they gain experience at provisioning nestlings and caring for fledglings without attracting predators, rather than {{as a direct result of}} improved foraging skills. In contrast, reproductive success only improved slightly with female age, although females of two or more years initiated their first clutch earlier in the season than one-year-old females, and tended to be mure likely to re-nest if a breeding attempt failed. The poor performance of young females appears unlikely to be related to their foraging ability but may be associated with costs imposed by dispersing to a breeding vacancy earlier in the year. Although the reproductive performance of Brown Thornbills improves considerably with age 1 found no evidence that performance improved as a result of repeated breeding attempts with the same partner...|$|E
40|$|In {{socially}} monogamous birds, females may express mate preferences {{when they}} first select a breeding partner, through divorce and subsequent breeding dispersal to a new partner and through extrapair mating. We examined settlement patterns, divorce and breeding dispersal in a sedentary Australian passerine, the <b>brown</b> <b>thornbill</b> (Acanthiza pusilla), in relation to two traits known to influence extrapair paternity (male age and male size). Settlement decisions, divorce and territory switching behaviour were all female strategies that reduced their likelihood of breeding with 1 -year-old males. Females preferred to settle in territories with 2 + -year-old males, {{were more likely to}} divorce 1 -year-old males, and only switched territories if they had an opportunity to form a new pair bond with an old male. In contrast, female settlement and divorce decisions were not influenced by male size. Female thornbills obtain a direct benefit from preferring older males as social mates because breeding success improves with male age in brown thornbills. Nevertheless, divorce rates in this species were low (14 % of pair bonds were terminated by divorce), and individuals rarely switched territories following the death of a mate. Both of these mating strategies appeared to be primarily constrained by the distance adults moved to initiate a new pair bond (1 - 2 territories) and by the limited availability of unpaired older males in the immediate neighbourhood...|$|E
40|$|We used multilocus DNA {{fingerprinting}} {{to assess}} parentage in the <b>brown</b> <b>thornbill,</b> Acanthiza pusilla, a socially monogamous Australian passerine. Extra-pair paternity was uncommon (6. 2 % of 178 offspring; 11. 9 % of 67 broods) {{and there was}} no evidence of intra-specific brood parasitism. Extra-pair paternity was limited because pairs spent more time together when females were fertile and males were able to evict intruding males before they could approach the female. Males were responsible for the close proximity of partners during the fertile period. Mate guarding therefore appears to be a male tactic aimed at preventing female infidelity rather than a cooperative behaviour of the pair aimed at preventing extra-pair copulations and/or female harassment. Females did not attempt to escape male guarding and were rarely observed to solicit copulations from intruding males. Nevertheless, females paired to smaller and younger males were more likely to cuckold their mates than females paired to larger and older males. This suggests that females may be more likely to seek or accept extra-pair matings when paired to small, young males or that old, large males are better at preventing their mates from engaging in extra-pair copulations. We found that male age but not male size influences mate-guarding behaviour. Older males tended to respond more aggressively to intruders. We therefore speculate that the relationship between male size/age and extra-pair paternity in brown thornbills may arise because female thornbills prefer large males as mates but are unable to express this preference as easily when paired to older males...|$|E
40|$|Uncertainty poses a {{substantial}} problem for animals, making {{it is essential}} for individuals to anticipate changes in their environment to select suitable behavioral strategies. In nest-building species where parents care for dependent young, predation is a major cause of reproductive failure. However, because parents generally have inadequate information about nest predation risks, attaining information about predation hazards increases their likelihood of making informed, optimal decisions. Risk assessment should therefore be widespread, particularly in incubating parents of species that breed in cavities or closed nests, which have limited information about predator presence. This study experimentally investigated the dynamic risk assessment in incubating female <b>brown</b> <b>thornbill</b> (Acanthiza pusilla), a long-lived Australian passerine, which builds closed dome nests in dense vegetation. When the females were exposed to the calls of a nest predator, a predator of adults, and a nonpredatory species, they reacted most strongly to the predator of adults' calls, by looking out of the nest for longest. Females significantly increased their level of alertness on hearing calls of both predator species and maintained their higher level of alertness after the simulated predator presence ended. Females in nests {{with a high degree of}} visual cover, and therefore a larger information deficit, reacted more strongly to predator calls than females in more open nests. Moreover, poorly concealed nests had a higher probability of being predated. These results show that incubating female thornbills use dynamic risk assessment and base their response on who is at risk and the degree of information defici...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{quantify}} bird {{responses to}} a large unplanned fire, taking into consideration landscape-level fire severity and extent, pre-fire site detection frequency and environmental gradients. Location: South-eastern Australia. Methods: A major wildfire in 2009 coincided with a long-term study of birds and provided {{a rare opportunity to}} quantify bird responses to wildfire. Using hierarchical Bayesian analysis, we modelled bird species richness and the detection frequency of individual species in response to a suite of explanatory variables, including (1) landscape-level fire severity and extent (2) pre-fire detection frequency, (3) site-level vegetation density and (4) environmental variables (e. g. elevation and topography). Results: Landscape-level fire severity had strong effects on bird species richness and the detection frequency of the majority of bird species. These effects varied markedly between species; most responded negatively to amount of severely burned forest in the landscape, one negatively to the amount of moderately burned forest and one responded negatively to the total area of burned forest. Only one species - the Flame Robin - responded positively to the amount of burned forest. Relationships with landscape-scale fire extent changed over time for one species - the <b>Brown</b> <b>Thornbill</b> - with initially depressed rates of detection recovering after just 2 years. The majority of species {{were significantly more likely to}} be detected in burned areas if they have been recorded there prior to the fire. Main conclusions: Birds responded strongly to the severity and spatial extent of fire. They also exhibited strong site fidelity even after severe wildfire which causes profound changes in vegetation cover - a response likely influenced by environmental features such as elevation and topography...|$|E

40|$|Urban remnant vegetation, {{especially}} where {{it occurs in}} public parks, allows for relatively easy access for ongoing biodiversity monitoring. However, relatively little baseline information on bird species distribution and abundance {{across a range of}} identifiable urban remnants appears in the published literature. We surveyed the relative abundance and distribution of birds across urban and suburban remnant vegetation in Melbourne, Australia. One hundred and six species were recorded, of which 98 were indigenous. Red wattlebirds had the highest mean relative abundance with 2. 94 birds/ha, followed by rainbow lorikeets (2. 51), noisy miners (1. 93), brown thornbills (1. 75) and spotted doves (0. 96). There was no obvious trend between overall relative abundance {{and the size of the}} remnant, in contrast to species richness which was positively correlated with remnant size. The data revealed that some species were either totally restricted to, or more abundant in, larger remnants and generally absent from smaller remnants. Some of the more common birds (crimson rosella, superb fairy-wren, spotted pardalote and black-faced cuckoo-shrike) recorded during this study were detected at similar densities to those found in comparable vegetation to the east of Melbourne within a largely forested landscape. Other species occurred at much lower densities (e. g., white-browed scrubwren, <b>brown</b> <b>thornbill,</b> eastern yellow robin and grey fantail) or had habitat requirements or ecological characteristics that could place them at risk of further decline or local extinction in the urban area. We identify a suite of bird species of potential conservation concern within Melbourne’s urban landscape. The establishment of repeatable, fixed-point, and long-term monitoring sites will allow for repeat surveying over time and provide an early warning of population declines, or conversely an indication of population increase for other species...|$|E
40|$|Predation {{ultimately}} {{affects the}} fitness of individuals. In nest building species like birds, the predation of dependent offspring {{is the most}} important source of reproductive failure, favouring the selection of parental adaptations to enhance offspring survival. However, environmental heterogeneity hampers individuals of having an accurate knowledge of perceived current risks. Consequently, individuals have to acquire information about their environment to optimise their nest site selection, antipredation responses, and parental investment decisions. Thus, individual reproductive decisions should be dynamic and depend on the availability and reliability of environmental information, as well as a species life-history strategy. This thesis examines the effect of individual risk assessment and antipredation strategies on parental investment in brown thornbills Acantiza pusilla, as well as the reliability of landscape features in predicting nest predation patterns in northern wheatears Oenanthe oenanthe. During incubation <b>brown</b> <b>thornbill</b> females used dynamic risk assessment to evaluate the risk different predators posed. Decreased environmental information via greater nest concealment increased female vigilance, with greater vigilance tending to increase brood survival. Within the breeding season, parental risk sensitivity increased and decreased for consecutive breeding attempts. Feeding rates {{in the presence of a}} predator of adults and a brood predator decreased, while risk taking increased by approaching predators more closely. When facing predators, brown thornbills used two alarm vocalisations, with alarm call rate denoting the degree of danger a predator posed to the adult birds. Parental alarm calls only silenced nesting begging over short time periods. In northern wheatears, predation increased for birds breeding closer to agricultural field and woodland habitat interfaces. This was only the case during incubation but not during nestling feeding, indicating that seasonal changes in ground vegetation structure and a change in predator composition can result in highly variable predation patterns. Overall, this thesis shows that antipredation responses and predation patterns can be dynamic and change within time and space, and thus influence the breeding success of bird species in general...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{species of}} Australian warblers (Acanthizidae) occur {{together}} in open eucalypt forests near Sydney, New South Wales. The ecological segregation of six of these species, which foraged primarily in shrub and tree vegetation and are similar sized (5 - 8 g), was studied during 1984. Seasonal {{data were obtained}} for five species; Weebill Smicromis brevirostris, White-throated Warbler or Gerygone Gerygone olivacea, Striated Thornbill Acanthiza lineata, Little Thornbill A. nana and Buff-rumped Thornbill A. reguloides. The sixth species, <b>Brown</b> <b>Thornbill</b> A. pusilla, was uncommon and seasonal comparisons were not possible. As has been reported for similar species associations in the northern hemisphere, the species studied differed in prey attack behaviour, foraging heights, use of plant species and selection of foraging substrates. There were significant seasonal differences {{in the use of}} foraging resources. For example, bark was more important as a foraging substrate in autumn and winter than in spring and summer. A. reguloides foraged more on the ground outside the breeding season than when nesting. The increased abundance of flying insects during summer correlated with an increased use of hawking and snatching as prey attack behaviours by all species. Despite their differences, species broadly overlapped in their use of resources and had similar niche breadths. Overlaps in the use of resources were greatest during spring, when prey resources were probably most abundant, and least in autumn when prey decreased in abundance. The forest in which the study was conducted was dominated by two species of eucalypts. Birds selected between these species but used the same foraging behaviours in each. Despite the selection between eucalypt species, the limited array of plant species had little effect on species richness. Comparison of niche breadths for the same species at other sites where there were different numbers of co-existing species suggests that niche breadth and overlap may be primarily determined by the availability of resources (e. g. substrates, plant species) and not by competitive interactions between the species themselves...|$|E
40|$|The {{clearance}} of woodlands and {{the simultaneous}} creation of alien environments {{have been identified}} as the primary reasons for the decline of many woodland birds in southeastern Australia. This study measured how the size of woodland remnants and habitat structural complexity affected bird composition and distribution in the northern Australian Capital Territory and bordering areas of New South Wales. Within this region only 8 % of the original woodlands remain, embedded as patches in a matrix of pasture and suburbia. Woodland birds were surveyed in 72 woodland remnants of different size and vegetation structural complexity. Avifaunal species richness was found to increase with remnant area and habitat complexity (p < 0. 01). Of the 31 resident woodland bird species detected, 22 were significantly affected by woodland patch size reduction and 20 species were significantly affected by habitat complexity loss (p < 0. 05). Of the species affected, 19 were affected by both reductions in patch size and vegetation complexity. Seven species (Weebill, <b>Brown</b> <b>Thornbill,</b> Buff-rumped Thornbill, Spotted Pardalote, Grey Shrike-thrush, Scarlet Robin and White-winged Chough) not previously identified as threatened by habitat fragmentation occurred significantly less often in small remnants with low habitat complexity. Assessment of avifaunal guilds based on body size and foraging behaviour showed that all large species (n = 4) and 85 % (n = 17) of insectivorous species that foraged above the ground were statistically affected by patch size and/or loss of habitat complexity. The occurrence of three species (50 %) of granivores was also significantly affected (p < 0. 05) by patch size and/or habitat complexity reduction. These results show that the distribution of many bird species, including some considered "common" and "widespread", is affected by patch size and habitat complexity. There are few, large complex woodland remnants within the study area, which continue to reduce in size and complexity. It is therefore predicted that the decline of woodland bird species will continue unless appropriate habitat conservation strategies are applied...|$|E
