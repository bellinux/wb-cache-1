40|$|To date, {{stem cell}} therapy for the <b>bladder</b> has been {{conducted}} mainly on an experimental basis {{in the areas of}} <b>bladder</b> dysfunction. The therapeutic efficacy of stem cells was originally thought to be derived from their ability to differentiate into various cell types.

Thus, we investigated changes in the properties of <b>bladder</b> afferent neurons in rats with <b>bladder</b> inflammation induced by intravesical application of hydrochloric acid. Eight days after the treatment, <b>bladder</b> function and <b>bladder</b> sensation were analyzed using cystometry and an electrodiagnostic device of sensory function (Neurometer), respectively. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings and immunohistochemical staining were also performed in dissociated <b>bladder</b> afferent neurons identified by a retrograde tracing dye, Fast Blue, injected into the <b>bladder</b> wall. Cystitis rats showed urinary frequency that was inhibited by pretreatment with capsaicin and <b>bladder</b> hyperalgesia mediated by C-fibers. Capsaicin-sensitive <b>bladder</b> afferent neurons from sham rats exhibited high thresholds for spike activation and a phasic firing pattern, whereas those from cystitis rats showed lower thresholds for spike activation and a tonic firing pattern.

40|$|The <b>bladder</b> is {{a hollow}} organ {{in the lower}} part of the abdomen. It is shaped like a small balloon and has a muscular wall that allows it to get larger or smaller. The <b>bladder</b> stores urine until it is passed out of the body. Urine is the liquid waste that is made by the kidneys when they clean the blood. The urine passes from the two kidneys into the <b>bladder</b> through two tubes called ureters. When the <b>bladder</b> is emptied during urination, the urine goes from the <b>bladder</b> to the outside of the body through another tube called the urethra. Early <b>bladder</b> cancer is also called {{superficial}} <b>bladder</b> cancer or non muscle invasive <b>bladder</b> cancer. This means that the cancer cells are only in the inner lining of the <b>bladder.</b> There are 3 stages of early <b>bladder</b> cancer 1. Stage Tis (also called CIS or carcinoma in situ) 2.

Endoscopic sphincterotomy may affect gall <b>bladder</b> motility. AIMS: To prospectively evaluate longterm effect of endoscopic sphincterotomy on gall <b>bladder</b> motility. PATIENTS: Thirty two patients with an intact gall <b>bladder</b> (15 with and 17 without gall <b>bladder</b> stones) who underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy for choledocholithiasis. METHODS: Gall <b>bladder</b> function was examined before and at from seven days to five years after sphincterotomy. Gall <b>bladder</b> volume, at fasting and after caerulein administration, was determined by ultrasonography. RESULTS: After endoscopic sphincterotomy, the enlarged orifice remained patent during a five year follow up period. One patient with gall <b>bladder</b> stones subsequently developed acute cholecystitis, the remaining being asymptomatic. In the patients before sphincterotomy, particularly in those with gall <b>bladder</b> stones, the gall <b>bladder</b> showed larger fasting volume and lower caerulein stimulated maximum contraction than normal controls. Throughout five years after sphincterotomy, fasting volume of the gall <b>bladder</b> decreased and its maximum contraction increased, regardless of gall <b>bladder</b> stones; {{significantly different from the}} values before sphincterotomy (p < 0. 05).

Since TRP channels have been implicated in the guidance of growth cones and survival of neurons, we investigated their involvement in the increases in <b>bladder</b> innervation and <b>bladder</b> activity in rodent models of cystitis. To induce <b>bladder</b> hyperactivity, we chronically injected cyclophosphamide in rats and mice. All experiments were performed a week later. We used quantitative transcriptional analysis and immunohistochemistry to determine TRP channel expression on retrolabelled <b>bladder</b> sensory neurons. To assess <b>bladder</b> function and referred hyperalgesia, urodynamic analysis, detrusor strip contractility and Von Frey filament experiments were done in wild type and knock-out mice. Repeated cyclophosphamide injections induce a specific increase in the expression of TRPC 1 and TRPC 4 in bladder-innervating sensory neurons and the sprouting of sensory fibers in the <b>bladder</b> mucosa. Interestingly, cyclophosphamide-treated Trpc 1 /c 4 (-/-) mice no longer exhibited increased <b>bladder</b> innervations, and, concomitantly, the development of <b>bladder</b> overactivity was diminished in these mice.

Methods: NWR was evoked in the lower and upper limbs by stimulating the sural and index finger digital nerves, respectively, while simultaneously recording EMG activity in the biceps femoris and biceps brachialis. NWR pain-related perception was quantified on a 10 -point pain scale. <b>Bladder</b> filling was evaluated with suprapubic <b>bladder</b> sonography.

Results: NWR magnitude in both upper and lower limbs and perceived pain for the upper limb were significantly decreased at higher levels of <b>bladder</b> filling compared to empty <b>bladder</b> sessions. Conclusions: Reduced NWR magnitude in both upper and lower limbs during <b>bladder</b> filling strongly indicates that <b>bladder</b> control and nociception share common modulatory descending pathways. <b>Bladder</b> afferents may activate these pathways to suppress the micturition reflex, but they may also inhibit spinal reflexes to maintain continence during pain stimuli. Significance: The effect of <b>bladder</b> filling on the NWR may represent a useful tool to investigate interactions between the neural pathways controlling the <b>bladder</b> and pain. © 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the use of}} a <b>bladder</b> ultrasound scanner in achieving a better reproducible <b>bladder</b> filling during irradiation of pelvic tumors, specifically prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: First, the accuracy of the <b>bladder</b> ultrasound scanner relative to computed tomography was validated in a group of 26 patients. Next, daily <b>bladder</b> volume variation was evaluated in a group of 18 patients. Another 16 patients participated in a biofeedback protocol, aiming at a more constant <b>bladder</b> volume. The last objective was to study correlations between prostate motion and <b>bladder</b> filling, by using electronic portal imaging device data on implanted gold markers. RESULTS: A strong correlation between <b>bladder</b> scanner volume and computed tomography volume (r = 0. 95) was found. Daily <b>bladder</b> volume variation was very high (1 SD = 47. 2 %). <b>Bladder</b> filling and daily variation did not significantly differ between the control and the feedback group (47. 2 % and 40. 1 %, respectively). Furthermore, no linear correlations between <b>bladder</b> volume variation and prostate motion were found. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows large variations in daily <b>bladder</b> volume. The use of a biofeedback protocol yields little reduction in <b>bladder</b> volume variation. Even so, the <b>bladder</b> scanner is an easy to use and accurate tool to register these variations...|$|R
