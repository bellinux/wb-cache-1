It is only recently that this important topic is considered {{in the context of}} belief functions. In this paper, the compatibility of various quantitative <b>belief</b> <b>measures</b> and qualitative <b>belief</b> structures is investigated. Four classes of <b>belief</b> <b>measures</b> considered are: the probability function, the monotonic belief function, Shafer's belief function, and Smets' generalized belief function. The analysis of their individual compatibility with different belief structures not only provides a sound b<msis for these quantitative measures, but also alleviates some of the difficulties in the acquisition and interpretation of numeric belief numbers. It is shown that the structure of qualitative probability is compatible with monotonic belief functions. Moreover, a belief structure slightly weaker than that of qualitative belief is compatible with Smets' generalized belief functions.

The theoretical framework was the cognitive orientation theory by Kreitler and Kreitler which shows how cognitive contents, primarily beliefs about goals, norms, the self and reality guide human behavior and enable its prediction and change. The hypotheses referred to endorsement of beliefs orienting towards CHD-involved behaviors, inconsistencies among belief types and the relation of the beliefs to risk factors in CHD patients as compared to the controls. A self-administered questionnaire was constructed assessing endorsement of four belief types. Subject were 92 males under 60 : 44 with CHD, and two control groups: 28 orthopedic patients without CHD, and 20 healthy subjects. Results showed that CHD individuals scored higher than the controls on the overall <b>beliefs</b> <b>measure,</b> <b>beliefs</b> about norms and about self, had higher inconsistency scores, and had more correlations between <b>belief</b> <b>measures</b> and risk factors (e. g. blood pressure, cholesterol).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Since the {{cognitive}} {{revolution of the}} early 1950 s, cognitions have been discussed as central components in the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses. Even though there is an extensive literature on the association between therapy-related cognitions such as irrational beliefs and psychological distress over the past 60 years, there is little meta-analytical knowledge {{about the nature of}} this association. METHODS: The relationship between irrational beliefs and distress was examined based on a systematic review that included 100 independent samples, gathered in 83 primary studies, using a random-effect model. The overall effects as well as potential moderators were examined: (a) distress measure, (b) irrational <b>belief</b> <b>measure,</b> (c) irrational belief type, (d) method of assessment of distress, (e) nature of irrational beliefs, (f) time lag between irrational beliefs and distress assessment, (g) nature of stressful events, (h) sample characteristics (i. e. age, gender, income, and educational, marital, occupational and clinical status), (i) developer/validator status of the author(s), and (k) publication year and country. RESULTS: Overall, irrational beliefs were positively associated with various types of distress, such as general distress, anxiety, depression, anger, and guilt (omnibus: r = 0. 38). The following variables were significant moderators {{of the relationship between the}} intensity of irrational beliefs and the level of distress: irrational <b>belief</b> <b>measure</b> and type, stressful event, age, educational and clinical status, and developer/validator status of the author.

40|$|AbstractThis paper proposes an {{integrated}} approach to indeterminacy and epistemic uncertainty {{in order to}} model an intelligent agentʼs decision making about the assertability of vague statements. Initially, valuation pairs are introduced {{as a model of}} truth-gaps for propositional logic sentences. These take the form of lower and upper truth-valuations representing absolutely true and not absolutely false respectively. In particular, we consider valuation pairs based on supervaluationist principles and also on Kleeneʼs three-valued logic. The relationship between Kleene valuation pairs and supervaluation pairs is then explored in some detail with particular reference to a natural ordering on semantic precision. In {{the second part of the}} paper we extend this approach by proposing bipolar belief pairs as {{an integrated}} model combining epistemic uncertainty and indeterminacy. These comprise of lower and upper <b>belief</b> <b>measures</b> on propositional sentences, defined by a probability distribution on a finite set of possible valuation pairs. The properties of these measures are investigated together with their relationship to different types of uncertainty measure. Finally, we apply bipolar <b>belief</b> <b>measures</b> in a preliminary decision theoretic study so as to begin to understand how the use of vague expressions can help to mitigate the risk associated with making forecasts or promises.

40|$|By {{using the}} Monte Carlo method, we can obtain {{the minimum value}} of a {{function}} V(r) that is generally associated with the potential energy. In this paper we present a method {{that makes it possible}} to speed up the classical Monte Carlo method. The new method is based on the observation that the Bolzmann transition probability and the concept of local thermodynamical equilibrium give rise to an initial state of maximum entropy, which is subsequently modified by using the information on the internal structure of the system. The classical thermodynamic model {{does not take into account}} any structures inside the system, and therefore in many cases does not accurately model the system itself. In an attempt to take into account the internal structure of the system, we propose a physical model of the <b>belief</b> <b>measure</b> as defined in the Dempster-Shafer theory. The recent discovery by Resconi of an algorithm to calculate the probability distribution that has previously been developed by Harmanec and Klir, and which is consistent with the <b>belief</b> <b>measure,</b> opens the way to utilizing the Bolzmann distribution not only with a uniform distribution of probability, but instead with an arbitrary distribution of probability to guide the Monte Carlo iterative method to obtain the global minimum value of the potential energy. Starting from local thermodynamic equilibrium (i. e., local symmetry), the algorithm computes a new distribution over subsystems, resulting in a nonuniform distribution and in symmetry breaking. In the general case one can start with a different initial distribution induced by other local symmetries, corresponding to specific differential equations (e. g., the Fokker-Planck equation) and calculate from this the global distribution corresponding to the breaking of local symmetry. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|E

Paranormal <b>belief</b> was <b>measured</b> using Thalbourne’s (1995) Rasch-scaled Australian Sheep-Goat Scale (ASGS), and Thalbourne’s (2010) new measure, the Basic Limiting Principles Questionnaire (BLPQ). We hypothesized that paranormal belief (a) is higher in females compared to males, and (b) correlates positively with conceivability (imagination), locus of control (LOC), and depression. It was further hypothesised that a sheep-goat effect would be found in an online symbol-identification task, in which it was also hypothesised that a ‘reactance’ treatment (a threatening communication; Silvia, 2005) would negatively affect ESP performance. Participants (N = 149) completed the ASGS, BLPQ, Thalbourne’s (1995) Conceivability Scale, Rotter’s (1966) LOC Scale, and Beck’s (Beck et al., 1996) Depression Inventory-II.
