[...] Smith began aggressively challenging apartheid in his classes, which drew the ire of his superiors who wanted him to [...] "Teach theory, not conclusions." [...] Smith joined public protests against the government's bulldozing of squatter shacks in Cape Town, and he was called before a church commission to justify himself. [...] Smith decided to resign his professorship and leave the DRC to join its separate colored branch, the Dutch Reformed Church in Africa. [...] Smith, together with his wife Ellen, became an anti-apartheid activist from that point onward. [...] He began preaching in Mamelodi in 1982, a suburb of Pretoria designated for non-whites only at the time due to the Group Areas Act. [...] Smith eventually received rare permission from the South African government to live there in 1985, making him and his wife the only whites allowed to live in the area. [...] In Mamelodi, he not only acted as minister, but also as a community organizer and civic planner. [...] To encourage integration and interaction between the separated communities, he organized a further swap in 1988 [...] 170 whites moved into Mamelodi to live with black families, while 35 blacks lived in white homes in the suburbs of Pretoria. [...] The exchange lasted four days. [...] At the time, few whites knew how blacks lived due to strict segregation rules. [...] Black neighborhoods were avoided and perceived as dangerous. [...] Smith explained that he ran the swap because [...] "White fear is one of the great barriers to understanding and progress in this country... <b>But</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> two years there has been an increasing realization by whites of the depth and the degree of black anger." [...] The swap was attacked as [...] "designed to promote Marxist doctrine", as nearly any opposition to apartheid was called a communist plot to destabilize the country.

40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{responds}} to {{the decision of the}} United Kingdom’s coalition government to abolish Aimhigher, a programme for widening higher education participation among disadvantaged young people in England. It examines recent research into widening participation and shows how the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students has narrowed slowly <b>but</b> significantly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> decade. Aimhigher’s role is explored, and the strengths of its partnership approach considered. Drawing on the notion of assemblage, the article then compares the values that underpin the narrative of Aimhigher with those embedded in the coalition government’s proposals for widening participation. The article concludes that <b>the</b> gains made <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> decade will be reversed and that social class divisions in university study will become further entrenched...|$|R
