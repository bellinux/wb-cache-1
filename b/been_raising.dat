5|$|Some climate {{scientists}} have theorized that aircraft contrails (also called vapor trails) are implicated in global dimming, but the constant flow of air traffic previously meant {{that this could}} not be tested. The near-total shutdown of civil air traffic during the three days following the September 11, 2001 attacks afforded a unique opportunity in which to observe the climate of the United States absent from the effect of contrails. During this period, an increase in diurnal temperature variation of over 1°C (1.8°F) was observed {{in some parts of}} the U.S., i.e. aircraft contrails may have <b>been</b> <b>raising</b> nighttime temperatures and/or lowering daytime temperatures by much more than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} a major {{contributor}} to female mortality in India. Indians account for 60% of the world's heart disease burden, despite accounting for less than 20% of the world's population. Indian women have a particular high mortality from cardiac disease and NGOs such as the Indian Heart Association have <b>been</b> <b>raising</b> awareness about this issue. Women have higher mortality rates relating to cardiovascular disease than men in India because of differential access to health care between the sexes. One reason for the differing rates of access stems from social and cultural norms that prevent women from accessing appropriate care. For example, it was found that among patients with congenital heart disease, women {{were less likely to be}} operated on than men because families felt that the scarring from surgery would make the women less marriageable.|$|E

25|$|Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman {{studying}} {{to become a}} nun at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg in 1938. Her love of music and the mountains, her youthful enthusiasm and imagination, and her lack of discipline cause some concern among the nuns. The Mother Abbess, believing Maria would be happier outside the abbey, sends her to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children—Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl. The Captain has <b>been</b> <b>raising</b> his children alone using strict military discipline {{following the death of}} his first wife.

25|$|Perez {{was born}} in the Bushwick {{neighborhood}} of Brooklyn, New York, to mother Lydia Perez and Ismael Serrano, a merchant marine seaman. Her parents, who were both from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, were married to other people when they met—she is the product of their affair. She was born at the now-closed Greenpoint Hospital in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn. Perez became a ward of the state when her mother took her from an aunt, who had <b>been</b> <b>raising</b> her. She was transferred to a group foster home at age three and lived in foster care in New York and Peekskill until age eight, and was still legally considered a ward of the State of New York until age 12. Her mother and aunt frequently visited, and her father made an unsuccessful custody bid at one point. Perez has five brothers and sisters from her mother's marriage to her mother's first husband, Ventura Perez, but also has additional half-brothers and half-sisters (a total of 10 children). These life problems left Perez with a speech impediment. She eventually moved in with paternal aunt, Ana Dominga Otero Serrano-Roque, and attended Grover Cleveland High School, which is located in the Ridgewood neighborhood of Queens. Her mother died of AIDS-related complications in 1999. Perez is Puerto Rican and had a strict Catholic upbringing, which she has credited to the influence of the nuns during her childhood.|$|E
