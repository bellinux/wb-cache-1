5|$|The disease term venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) {{includes the}} development of either DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). Genetic factors that {{increase the risk of}} VTE include deficiencies of three proteins that normally prevent blood from clotting—protein C, protein S, and antithrombin—in addition to non-O <b>blood</b> <b>type</b> and mutations in the factor V and prothrombin genes. Deficiencies in antithrombin, protein C, and protein S are rare but strong, or moderately strong, risk factors. These three thrombophilia increase the risk of VTE by about 10 times. Factor V Leiden, which makes factor V resistant to inactivation by activated protein C, and the genetic variant prothrombin G20210A, which causes increased prothrombin levels, are predominantly expressed in Caucasians. They moderately increase risk for VTE, by three to eight times for factor V Leiden and two to three times for prothrombin G20210A. Having a non-O <b>blood</b> <b>type</b> roughly doubles VTE risk. Non-O <b>blood</b> <b>type</b> is common in all races, making it an important risk factor. Individuals without O <b>blood</b> <b>type</b> have higher blood levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII than those with O <b>blood</b> <b>type,</b> increasing the likelihood of clotting.|$|E

40|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>typing</b> is a {{critical}} test in many medical procedures, especially for blood transfusion. Incompatible red blood cells (RBCs) in transfusion might result in intravascular hemolysis and even cause recipients death. The test result of <b>blood</b> <b>typing</b> can be determined by observing the agglutination of RBCs. In this study, a microfluidic <b>blood</b> <b>typing</b> chip with interdigitated electrodes is presented. ZnO nanowires were synthesized on the interdigitated electrodes so that voltammetry measurement was employed to determine the test results of <b>blood</b> <b>typing.</b> The experimental {{results show that the}} discrimination between agglutination and non-agglutination was obvious and successful determinations of RBC agglutinations in <b>blood</b> <b>typing</b> tests were achieved by means of voltammetry measurement...|$|R

5|$|Mills booked {{herself into}} the Hippocrates Health Institute in Florida, which put her on a raw food vegan diet, using wheat grass and garlic poultices to heal her wound. After an operation, Mills {{discovered}} {{that she had been}} previously identified as having an O rhesus negative <b>blood</b> <b>type,</b> when in fact she was A rhesus negative, which had interfered with her attempts to follow the so-called <b>blood</b> <b>type</b> diet. As her prosthetic leg had to be replaced on a regular basis, because the size of the amputated stump kept changing as it healed, she had the idea to collect thousands of discarded prosthetic limbs for amputees in Croatia. Mills persuaded the Brixton prison governor to get inmates to dismantle and pack the prosthetic limbs before being transported, which resulted in 22,000 amputees obtaining limbs in addition to the Croatian citizens who were already supplied with prosthetic limbs by the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance, which paid for the fitting of limbs and rehabilitation of patients. The first convoy of limbs arrived in Zagreb in October 1994 and Mills travelled with the convoy to film interviews with some of the recipients for the Good Morning with Anne and Nick daytime TV show. She received an award in 2001 from Croatia's prime minister, Ivica Račan for the money she raised to help clear that country of landmines.|$|E

5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on an organism's phenotype, {{or physical}} characteristics. Phenotype {{is determined by}} an organism's genetic make-up (genotype) and {{the environment in which}} the organism lives. When different organisms in a population possess different versions of a gene for a certain trait, each of these versions is known as an allele. It is this genetic variation that underlies differences in phenotype. An example is the ABO <b>blood</b> <b>type</b> antigens in humans, where three alleles govern the phenotype.|$|E

40|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>typing</b> is an {{important}} medical immunodiagnostic test for human blood transfusion and organ transplantation. Today, the global demand for accurate and rapid <b>blood</b> <b>typing</b> diagnosis is extremely large. However, highly sophisticated <b>blood</b> <b>typing</b> techniques are not appropriate for resource-limited regions, as they are either too expensive or require professional technicians to operate them. There is also an extensive demand for low-cost <b>blood</b> <b>typing</b> techniques with the capabilities of automation and high-throughput operation in blood bank laboratories and hospitals. To solve these problems, the research reported in this thesis focuses on the investigation and development of <b>blood</b> <b>typing</b> devices based on bioactive paper, and liquid micro reactors fabricated using superhydrophobic materials. This thesis includes two parts, which present research work on <b>blood</b> <b>typing</b> techniques based on bioactive paper devices and liquid micro reactors. In the first part, research into the fundamental mechanisms of paper-based <b>blood</b> <b>typing</b> devices combines scientific information with microscopic techniques and expertise in papermaking. The agglutination and immobilization mechanisms of red blood cells (RBCs) in antibody-treated paper are explored using confocal microscopy. The transport pathways of RBCs within the fibre network of paper are studied using a combined dual beam system with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and focused ion beam (FIB) technology. Both these microscopic methods developed are powerful techniques for providing the details of RBCs at cellular level inside paper. This part also demonstrates a potential application for controlling the performance of paper-based blood analysis devices through paper structure design, which can be achieved during the papermaking process. Clear understanding of the fundamental mechanisms {{is essential for the}} design and production of paper-based <b>blood</b> <b>typing</b> devices which meet the ASSURED criteria (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid, equipment-free and deliverable to those who need them). It is also important for the development of other paper-based blood analysis devices, and will contribute to the improvement of public health situations in rural areas and developing countries. The second part of this thesis presents innovations in the application of liquid micro reactors fabricated from superhydrophobic materials for <b>blood</b> <b>typing</b> devices. Two design concepts for the production of liquid micro reactors are demonstrated in this part: one is a superhydrophobic surface-supported liquid drop; the other is a liquid marble – a liquid drop wrapped in superhydrophobic powder. In both cases, the near-spherical shape of the liquid micro reactors enables the devices to provide clear and magnified side views to facilitate the observation of the detailed processes of RBC haemagglutination. Most importantly, by integrating these devices with advanced image capture and processing techniques, the automation of high-throughput <b>blood</b> <b>typing,</b> including rapid assay result interpretation, data storage, and transmission, can be achieved. The author sincerely hopes that the findings presented in this thesis on the applications of bioactive paper and liquid micro reactors in <b>blood</b> <b>typing</b> will serve the community by providing high-performance, simple <b>blood</b> <b>typing</b> devices. The author also hopes that the findings will be extended to the development of other blood-based diagnostic devices...|$|R
5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA or RNA which codes for a molecule that has a function. The DNA is first copied into RNA. The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring {{is the basis of}} the inheritance of phenotypic traits. These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes. Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as gene–environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye color or number of limbs, and some are not, such as <b>blood</b> <b>type,</b> risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.|$|E

25|$|A {{complete}} <b>blood</b> <b>type</b> {{would describe}} {{a full set}} of 30 substances on the surface of RBCs, and an individual's <b>blood</b> <b>type</b> is one of many possible combinations of blood-group antigens.

Another more common cause in <b>blood</b> <b>type</b> change is a bone marrow transplant. Bone-marrow transplants are performed for many leukemias and lymphomas, among other diseases. If a person receives bone marrow from someone who is a different ABO type (e.g., a type A patient receives a type O bone marrow), the patient's <b>blood</b> <b>type</b> will eventually convert to the donor's type.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>typing</b> and, more {{recently}} DNA analysis, {{have been used}} to confirm Spanish ancestry of both feral and domesticated groups of horses.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the correlation of ABO <b>blood</b> <b>types</b> and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with ureteral transitional cell carcinoma. Materials and Methods: In our study, an entire cohort of 239 patients who were pathological diagnosed as ureteral transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) between February 2002 and March 2010 were reviewed retrospectively. Variables including demographic features, tumor grades, tumor stages, type of surgery and number of tumors as well as ABO <b>blood</b> <b>types</b> status were evaluated. The relationship between the ABO blood group and clinicopathological variables was assessed by Chi-squared analysis. Results: The ratio of male to female was 1 : 1. 12. The median age at diagnosis was 68. 5 years. A total of 111 neoplasms located in the right ureter. A total of 218 patients had radical nephroureterectomy (RNU). Multifocality was observed in 32 patients. The pathology was as follow: Grade 1 (seven cases), Grade 2 (110 cases) and Grade 3 (122 cases); Ta and T 1 (83 cases), T 2 -T 4 (156 cases). The distribution of ABO <b>blood</b> <b>types</b> was A, B, O and AB in 70 (29. 3 %), 76 (31. 8 %), 66 (27. 6 %) and 27 (11. 3 %), respectively. There were no significant differences in the clinicopathological variables among individuals with different ABO <b>blood</b> <b>types.</b> In a subgroup analysis, B and O group showed a worse tumor stage compared with A and AB groups (P = 0. 01). Conclusion: B and O <b>blood</b> <b>types</b> are at higher risk of muscle invasive ureteral TCC as compared with A and AB <b>blood</b> <b>types.</b> We suggest ABO <b>blood</b> <b>types</b> to be taken into consideration when urologists select therapeutic schemes for individuals with ureteral TCC...|$|R
