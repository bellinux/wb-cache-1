25|$|The {{total market}} {{worldwide}} for high-tech toilets was about US$800 million in 1997. The largest producer is Toto, with 65% {{of the market}} share, while the second largest is Inax at 25%. The main market for washlets is still in Japan, and TOTO reports that overseas sales account for just 5% of its revenue. The primary foreign market is China, where Toto sells over one million washlets each year. In the US for example, sales are well below Japanese levels, even though sales improved from 600 units per month in 2001 to 1,000 units per month in 2003. In Europe, Toto sells only 5,000 washlets annually. While most Europeans would probably regard Japanese washlets as quite a curiosity, {{the number of such}} toilets being installed in Europe is on the rise. This is mainly for the special purpose of toilets for the handicapped. Depending on the type of disability, handicapped persons may have difficulties reaching the anus region in order to clean themselves after toilet use. Hence, the introduction of toilets with a water jet cleaner and <b>blow</b> <b>dryer</b> allows such persons to clean themselves without assistance.|$|E

His next victim was 19-year-old Linda Grover from Florida State University, whom he abducted from the Governor's Square Mall in Tallahassee, Florida, and transported to Bainbridge, Georgia, on March 20. She had declined his offer to photograph her for a modeling agency, after which he assaulted her in the mall parking lot, bound her hands, wrapped her in a blanket, {{and put her in}} the trunk of his car. That night, in room 30 of the Glen Oaks Motel, he raped her, and then used a <b>blow</b> <b>dryer</b> and super glue to blind her. He [...] tortured her further by applying copper wires to her feet and passing an electric current through them.

2500|$|The modern toilet in Japan, in English {{sometimes}} called Super Toilet, and commonly known in Japanese as [...] or as [...] {{is one of}} the most advanced types of toilet worldwide, showing a dazzling array of features. The Toto product Washlet Zoe is listed in Guinness World Records as the world's most sophisticated toilet with seven functions. However, as the model was introduced in 1997, it is now likely to be inferior to the latest model by Toto, Neorest. The idea for the washlet came from abroad, and the first toilet seat with integrated bidet was produced in the United States in 1964. The age of the high-tech toilet in Japan started in 1980 with the introduction of the Washlet G Series by Toto, and since then the product name washlet has been used to refer to all types of Japanese high-tech toilets. As of 2002, almost half of all private homes in Japan have such a toilet, exceeding the number of households with a personal computer. While the toilet looks like a Western-style toilet at first glance, there are numerous additional features—such as <b>blow</b> <b>dryer,</b> seat heating, massage options, water jet adjustments, automatic lid opening, automatic flushing, wireless control panel, room heating and air conditioning for the room—included either as part of the toilet or in the seat.

50|$|Excessive or rough {{brushing}} {{can cause}} breakage. This results in frizz because {{the hair is}} stretched out of shape before it breaks, so that the shorter hair that remains tends to spring outward, away from {{the main body of}} hair. Backcombing can be damaging, as can combing curly hair when it is dry. Excessive use of heat styling tools such as <b>blow</b> <b>dryers</b> and flatirons can weaken the hair, making it susceptible to breakage and split ends. Recommendations for minimizing heat damage include using heat styling tools set on low, using a diffuser when blow drying, and never using a curling iron or flat iron on wet hair. Direct heat can boil the water in the hair, causing bubbles to form inside the hair fiber, weakening the hair. Some authors recommend avoiding heat altogether, and allowing the hair to air-dry.|$|R

40|$|The initial {{reports in}} this issue of two new studies of {{childhood}} brain cancer and 60 -Hz magnetic fields (1, 2) illustrate a few general observations on evolving research in this area. Epidemiologic assessment of magnetic field exposures is still primitive. Magnetic field exposures come from many different sources. We should not be proud that we still study them one by one. Appliance-specific relative risks (one for <b>blow</b> <b>dryers,</b> one for curling irons, etc.) are the most glaring example. Time-activity data and magnetic flux density measurements are needed to quantify exposures from individual appliances. At a minimum, this information could be used to stabilize ensembles of appliance-specific relative risk estimates (3 - 6). Ideally, appliance exposures would be consolidated and combined with measures of exposure from power lines and other sources. Developing a program of combined-source magnetic field exposure assessment tailored for use in epidemiologic studies would be a challenging, but technically feasible, task. No methodological need is greater in this area of research. Responding to a private exhortation to work toward a multiappliance exposure measure, an epidemiologist once expressed to me a reluctance to "combine apples and oranges. " The simile was ironic. Combining fruits is exactly what is done in the more mature field of nutritional epidemiology to measure consumption of fructose and other nutrients...|$|R

50|$|The next {{ingredient}} used is polymer or resin. Polymers are {{the most}} effective and important component of hair mousse, which acts as a conditioning agent. These resins are long chain molecules that form a film on the hair allowing a tighter grip on the hair strands, making it harder to brush off and form a resistant film. This allows users to comb or brush their hair, as well as apply heat from a <b>blow</b> <b>dryer</b> without the mousse leaving the hair stiff.|$|E
40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of MDF {{there is a need}} for direct measurement methods for the size parameters of the fibres, helping particularly with the control of the disintegration process. In a joint project new methods were tested. The main focus of the investigations were two optical methods, laser scanner and diffraction spectrometry. Both methods are able to measure the particles in an air-borne state (aerosol) or stirred in water (suspension) and both were successfully used for the measurement of particle size on a laboratory scale as well as on-line devics monitoring the refining process. Due to their measuring principle they are not able to analyse completely the complex structure of the fibres but they provide data useful as "fingerprint" in the laboratory and the production. At first, mixtures of different sieve fractions were dispersed in a fluid of which portions were analysed off-line showing that the mixture ratio could be determined quantitatively with both methode. For the on-line measurement the instruments were installed in the duct from the <b>blow</b> line <b>dryer</b> to the cyclone of a laboratory refiner plant. Under different conditons fibre material was produced from chips of pine, spruce and beech wood as well as from used wood. The temperature and the retention period in the pre-evaporator were varied as well as the gap width in the refiner. The distribution of the particle size reflected the alterations in the disintegration parameters and in the characteristics of the wood species. Both measuring devices indicated, under on-line conditons, changes in the gap width of the refiner. Furthermore, it turned out that long fibres play an important role in the correlation of the properties of the fibre material and the board properties...|$|R

50|$|A hair dryer, hairdryer or <b>blow</b> <b>dryer</b> is an {{electromechanical}} device designed to blow normal or hot air over damp hair {{to accelerate the}} evaporation of water particles and dry the hair. Blow dryers allow better control over the shape and style of hair, by accelerating and controlling the formation of temporary hydrogen bonds inside each strand. These hydrogen bonds are powerful (allowing for stronger hair shaping than the sulfur bonds formed by permanent waving products) but are temporary and extremely vulnerable to humidity. They disappear with a single washing of the hair.|$|E
