50|$|The dynamic <b>bending</b> of <b>beams,</b> {{also known}} as {{flexural}} vibrations of beams, was first investigated by Daniel Bernoulli in the late 18th century. Bernoulli's equation of motion of a vibrating beam tended to overestimate the natural frequencies of beams and was improved marginally by Rayleigh in 1877 {{by the addition of}} a mid-plane rotation. In 1921 Stephen Timoshenko improved the theory further by incorporating the effect of shear on the dynamic response of <b>bending</b> <b>beams.</b> This allowed the theory to be used for problems involving high frequencies of vibration where the dynamic Euler-Bernoulli theory is inadequate. The Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko theories for the dynamic <b>bending</b> of <b>beams</b> continue to be used widely by engineers.|$|R

50|$|A {{synchrotron}} is {{a particular}} type of cyclic particle accelerator, descended from the cyclotron, in which the accelerating particle beam travels around a fixed closed-loop path. The magnetic field which bends the particle beam into its closed path increases with time during the accelerating process, being synchronized to the increasing kinetic energy of the particles (see image). The synchrotron {{is one of the first}} accelerator concepts to enable the construction of large-scale facilities, since <b>bending,</b> <b>beam</b> focusing and acceleration can be separated into different components. The most powerful modern particle accelerators use versions of the synchrotron design. The largest synchrotron-type accelerator is the 27 km Large Hadron Collider (LHC) near Geneva, Switzerland, built in 2008 by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).|$|E
50|$|Wooden {{laminated}} longbows {{can be made}} by gluing {{together two}} or more different pieces of wood. Usually this is done {{to take advantage of the}} inherent properties of different woods: some woods can better withstand compression while others are better at withstanding tension. Examples include hickory and lemonwood, or bamboo and yew longbows: hickory or bamboo is used on the back of the bow (the part facing away from the archer when shooting) and so is in tension, while the belly (the part facing the archer when shooting) is made of lemonwood or yew and undergoes compression (see bending for a further explanation of stresses in a <b>bending</b> <b>beam).</b> Traditionally made Japanese yumi are also laminated longbows, made from strips of wood: the core of the bow is bamboo, the back and belly are bamboo or hardwood, and hardwood strips are laminated to the bow's sides to prevent twisting. Ready-made laminated longbows are available for purchase.|$|E

Leaching due to aggressive water can be responsible for a loss of mechanical properties and stability of concrete structures. This paper focuses on coupled chemo-mechanical effects on concrete structures subjected to aggressive water inducing calcium leaching. Experimental investigations on mortar <b>bending</b> <b>beams</b> and their analysis are detailed. The response of leached mortar beams is deduced from these tests. It is found that the stiffness of mortar decreases, along with its strength, as the chemical attack progresses.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} {{we show that}} a {{structure}} consisting {{of a network of}} <b>bending</b> <b>beams</b> can exhibit a negative Poisson’s ratio. We have shown that the negative Poisson’s ratio behaviour is driven by the (bcc analogous) type III beams, the type II (fcc like) beams result in a structure with a Poisson’s ratio of around zero and type I (simple cubic configuration) beams result in a Poisson’s ratio of nearly + 1. The tensile and shear strengths of the type III beams are augmented by addition of type II and type III beams. By tailoring the relative stiffness of the component beams within the structure it is possible to design an auxetic truss structure with specific Poisson’s ratio, tensile and shear moduli. This validates the hypothesis that crystal structures can provide inspiration for macro structures with tailored mechanical properties where the mechanism for negative Poisson’s ratio (auxetic) behaviour at the atomic scale in cubic crystals is replicated by <b>bending</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|R

40|$|People with neuromuscular {{diseases}} request an orthosis {{close to}} the body for assistance with their arm movements. This paper proposes a concept for a passive arm support that is {{close to the}} body and is based on <b>bending</b> <b>beams.</b> Simulations resulted in the final configuration and dimensions of the beams, optimised to balance an arm. One Carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer beam with dimensions 0. 22 x 0. 0041 x 0. 0027 m at the medial side and one at the lateral side of the upper arm delivers the required energy for balancing the arm. Experimental evaluation of a prototype demonstrated the technical principle; more than 87 % of the moment around the shoulder was balanced between 0 and 1. 1 rad. A second prototype was built for preliminary evaluation of the concept in relation to the body. The width of the elastic and structural elements was more than four times smaller than in present arm supports.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Because of its {{attractive}} {{material properties}} like high hardness, high toughness, and excellent high temperature strength, materials like silicon nitride {{are becoming more}} common for use in high performance applications. However, there have been limited studies of the fatigue behavior of small cracks in silicon nitride and other materials toughened by grain bridging mechanisms. This study explores using micro Raman spectroscopy, fatigue crack growth data and results from static fracture experiments to determine a bridging stress profile for silicon nitride doped with MgO and Y₂O₃ as sintering additives.
