50|$|On Skylab 2, {{only the}} <b>bicycle</b> <b>ergometer</b> was {{available}} for the in-flight exercise, with testing performed 18 days before launch and 5 days after landing. While it was realized that these times were too temporally remote from the flight, {{this was the best}} that could be achieved due to schedule constraints. By the time day 5 muscle testing was completed, some recovery in function had likely occurred; however, a marked decrement still remained. The decrement in leg extensor strength was nearly 25%; the arms suffered less but also exhibited marked losses (data not shown). The Commander's arm extensors showed no loss, since he used these muscles in hand-pedaling the bicycle, being the only Skylab crewmember to adopt this mode of arm exercise. This illustrated a fundamental point in muscle conditioning: to maintain the strength of a muscle, it must be stressed to or near the level at which it will have to function. Leg extensor muscles, important in standing and providing propulsive forces during walking, are capable of generating forces of hundreds of pounds, while the arm extensor forces are measured in tens of pounds. Forces developed in pedaling a <b>bicycle</b> <b>ergometer</b> are typically tens of pounds and are thus incapable of maintaining leg strength. The <b>bicycle</b> <b>ergometer</b> proved to be an excellent machine for aerobic exercise and cardiovascular conditioning, but it was not capable of developing either the type or level of forces needed to maintain strength for walking under 1G.|$|E
40|$|The {{executive}} function of shifting between mental sets demands cognitive flexibility. Based on evidence that physical exercise fostered cognition, we tested whether acute physical exercise can improve shifting in an unselected sample of adolescents. Genetic polymorphisms were analyzed {{to gain more}} insight into possibly contributing neurophysiological processes. We examined 297 students aged between 13 and 17 years in their schools. Physical exercise was manipulated by an intense incremental exercise condition using <b>bicycle</b> <b>ergometers</b> and a control condition which involved watching an infotainment cartoon while sitting calm. The order of conditions was counterbalanced between participants. Shifting was assessed by a switching task after both conditions. Acute intense physical exercise significantly improved shifting as indicated by reduced switch costs. Exercise-induced performance gains in switch costs were predicted by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) targeting the Dopamine Transporter (DAT 1 /SLCA 6 A 3) gene suggesting that the brain dopamine system contributed to the effect. The results demonstrate the potential of acute physical exercise to improve cognitive flexibility in adolescents. The field conditions of the present approach suggest applications in schools...|$|R

A spectrometer interface was constructed using standard scanner hardware, complemented with custom-built parts and software to enable gated data acquisition during exercise. High-quality 31 P NMR spectra were reproducibly obtained from the medial head of the quadriceps muscle of the right leg of eight healthy subjects during two-legged high-frequency pedaling (80 revolutions per minute) at three incremental workloads, including maximal. Muscle phosphocreatine content dropped 82 %, from 32. 2 ± 1. 0 mM at rest to 5. 7 ± 1. 1 mM at maximal workload (mean ± standard error; n = 8), indicating that the majority of quadriceps motor units were recruited. The cardiovascular load of the exercise was likewise significant, as evidenced by heart rates of 150 (± 10 %) beats per minute, measured immediately afterward.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 35 - 39) Angina pectoris {{occurs as}} a result of an insufficient blood supply to the heart. This condition is present in some individuals with coronary artery disease. Physicians often prescribe exercise to raise the functional level of individuals with angina. Conditioning increases the body's ability to utilize oxygen efficiently, thus reducing the demand on the heart. In cardiac rehabilitation programs, various exercise modes are employed. Often angina occurs during these exercise sessions but with a greater incidence on one particular mode. The purpose of this study was to determine if angina occurred with greater incidence on the treadmill or bicycle during a medically supervised cardiac rehabilitation program at Granada Hills Community Hospital. The time until onset of angina was also examined for each mode of exercise. Twenty-five individuals with diagnosed coronary artery disease and angina pectoris participated in the study. Blood pressure and heart rate along with time until anginal onset were recorded on the treadmill and <b>bicycle</b> <b>ergometers.</b> The results revealed that angina occurred with a significantly greater incidence on the treadmill when an individual exercised at equivalent workloads on each mode.

40|$|The {{positive}} influence {{of physical activity}} for people at all life stages is well known. Exercising has a proven therapeutic effect on the cardiovascular system and can counteract the increase of cardiovascular diseases in our aging society.

Being able to model and predict the response of a subject’s heart rate on work load input allows {{the development of more}} advanced smart devices and analytic tools. These tools can monitor and control the subject’s activity and thus avoid overstrain which would eliminate the positive effect on the cardiovascular system.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyze the early effects of short-term exercise training, without any specific diet, on the HDL cholesterol plasma levels and HDL functional characteristics in patients with the metabolic syndrome (MS). We studied 30 sedentary subjects, 20 with and 10 without the MS. The patients with the MS underwent moderate intensity exercise training for 3 months on <b>bicycle</b> <b>ergometers.</b> Blood was sampled before and after training for biochemical analysis, paraoxonase- 1 activity, and HDL subfraction composition and antioxidative capacity. Lipid transfer to HDL was assayed in vitro using a labeled nanoemulsion as the lipid donor. At baseline, the MS group had greater triglyceride levels and a lower HDL cholesterol concentration and lower paraoxonase- 1 activity than did the controls. Training decreased the plasma triglycerides but did not change the low-density lipoprotein or HDL cholesterol levels. Nonetheless, exercise training increased the HDL subfractions` antioxidative capacity and paraoxonase- 1 activity. After training, the MS group had compositional changes in the smallest HDL subfractions associated with increased free cholesterol and cholesterol ester transfers to HDL, reaching normal values. In conclusion, the present investigation has added relevant information about the dissociation between the quantitative and qualitative aspects of HDL after short-term exercise training without any specific diet in those with the MS, highlighting the importance of evaluating the functional aspects of the lipoproteins, in addition to their plasma levels.

The aim {{of this study was to}} test the hypothesis that the allergic inflammation in the lung of allergic asthmatics will be enhanced due to the pre-exposure to UFP. Methods: Fourteen mild allergic asthmatics were exposed for 2 h to a controlled atmosphere of 50 lg/m 3 spark-discharge generated carbon black UFP (Ø 50 nm) or clean air in a randomized, double-blind crossover design. The expositions were performed with a wash-out period of 30 days under intermittent <b>bicycles</b> <b>ergometer</b> exercise.

Forty-two h after the expositions, during a second bronchoscopy, the previously challenged segments were lavaged and BAL-cells were obtained for differentiated FACS analysis and oxygen radical generation by chemiluminescence. Results: The preexposition to ultrafine particles showed only a slight nonsignificant short term effect after 42 h on the allergic inflammation compared to the exposition with clean air. The subgroup of subjects however, which were exposed to ultrafine particles in the first period and to clean air in the second period showed after the allergen challenge in the second period a strong increase in the absolute numbers of eosinophils and oxygen radical generation by BAL-cells.

At the completion of the ten week training period the groups were reversed and the control group became the exercise group for the second ten week training program. The initial training group became the control or detraining group. Peak and submaximal cardiovascular exercise responses were measured on four occasions over the two training periods. Polar 'Sports Tester' Heart Rate Monitors were used during all of the training sessions which enabled heart rate data to be collected and stored during the exercise periods.

40|$|Kinematic (relative phase error), {{metabolic}} (oxygen consumption, heart rate) and attentional (baseline and cycling reaction times) {{variables were}} measured while participants practised a high energy-demanding, intrinsically unstable 90 ° relative phase coordination pattern on independent <b>bicycle</b> <b>ergometers.</b> The variables {{were found to}} be strongly inter-correlated, suggesting a link between emerging performance stability with practice and minimal metabolic and attentional cost. The effects of practice of 90 ° relative phase coordination on the performance of in-phase (0 °-phase) and antiphase (180 °-phase) coordination were investigated by measuring the relative phase attractor layouts and recording the metabolic and attentional cost of the three coordination patterns before and after practice. The attentional variables did not differ significantly between coordination patterns and did not change with practice. Before practice, the coordination performance was most accurate and stable for in-phase cycling, with antiphase next and 90 °-phase the poorest. However, metabolic cost was lower for antiphase than either in-phase or 90 °-phase cycling, and the pre-practice attractor layout deviated from that predicted on the basis of dynamic stability as an attractor state, revealing an attraction to antiphase cycling. After practice of 90 °-phase cycling, in-phase cycling remained the most accurate and stable, with 90 °-phase next and antiphase the poorest, but antiphase retained the lowest metabolic energy cost. The attractor layout had changed, with new attractors formed at the practised 90 °-phase pattern and its symmetrical partner of 270 °-phase. Considering both the pre- and post-practice results, attractors were formed at either a low metabolic energy cost but less stable (antiphase) pattern or at a more stable but higher metabolic energy cost (90 °-phase) pattern, but in neither case at the most stable and accurate (in-phase) pattern. The results suggest that energetic factors affect coordination dynamics and that coordination modes lower in metabolic energy expenditure may compete with dynamically stable modes. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the turn}} of the century a {{considerable}} amount of experimental work has been carried out with a view to determining the efficiency with which man converts the fuel energy of his food to mechanical work. From such work, power output figures for extended durations of working have been accumulated, <b>bicycle</b> <b>ergometers</b> being commonly used to load the subject. However, comparatively few studies have been made on man&# 146;s ability to generate power for short periods of time e. g. less than five minutes, and little serious attempt has been made to develop a mechanism which would allow, for a given period of time, maximal power release. In the early 1960 &# 146;s the need for such data was emphasised by workers attempting to design a successful man-powered aircraft. The aim of this work, which is both analytical and experimental in nature, is firstly to develop the design of an ergometer which will allow a subject to work in a wide variety of ways, some of which should allow the release of relatively large amounts of power. The second aim is to carry out an experimental investigation on such an ergometer, to compare the relative effectiveness of various ways of working, and to produce further data on short term man-power output.

Subjects/Methods:In all, 14 healthy young adults (age: 22. 2 ± 1. 0 years, height: 173. 5 ± 4. 6 cm, body mass: 72. 512. 5 kg) who trained regularly conducted incremental exhaustive <b>ergometer</b> <b>bicycle</b> exercises after-ornithine hydrochloride supplementation (0. 1 g/kg, body mass) and placebo conditions with a cross-over design. The exercise time (sec) of the incremental ergometer exercise, exercise intensity at exhaustion (watt), maximal oxygen uptake (ml per kg per min), maximal heart rate (beats per min) and the following serum parameters were measured before ingestion, 1 h after ingestion, just after exhaustion and 15 min after exhaustion: ornithine, ammonia, urea, lactic acid and glutamate. All indices on maximal aerobic capacity showed insignificant differences between both the conditions. Results:Plasma ammonia concentrations just after exhaustion and at 15 min after exhaustion were significantly more with ornithine ingestion than with placebo. Plasma glutamate concentrations were significantly higher after exhaustion with ornithine ingestion than with placebo. Conclusions:It was suggested that, although the ingestion of L-ornithine hydrochloride before the exercise cannot be expected to improve performance, it does increase the ability to buffer ammonia, both during and after exercise. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved...|$|R
