40|$|Abstract—Contemporary {{maritime}} piracy around the Horn of Africa presents {{a serious threat}} to the global shipping industry. A number of countermeasures were deployed to minimize the probability of a successful hijack, one of them being the establishment of the International Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC). Currently, all ships transiting the Gulf of Aden are strongly recommended to follow the IRTC and take part in group transit schemes—prescribed schedules stating time of arrival to the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> and speed at which to sail through the corridor. These schedules are fixed in advance and do not take into account speeds and constraints of arriving ships. We propose dynamic grouping schemes, customized schedules for a group of arriving ships, which take into account speeds as well as positions of arriving ships. The problem of finding optimum grouping scheme for a group of arriving ships is formulated as a bi-objective mixed integer program, weighting the delay caused by the grouping scheme and the risk taken when sailing alone. We look for a set of Pareto optimal solutions and compare the dynamic grouping scheme with currently deployed fixed scheme. Results show an improvement over current grouping scheme with respect to the number of ships grouped as well as time saved.

Currently, all ships transiting the Gulf of Aden are recommended to follow the IRTC and take part in group transit schemes—prescribed fixed schedules stating a time of arrival to the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> and a speed at which to sail through the corridor. We provide number of contributions that improve the group transit schemes: we formalize the grouping problem, we design an efficient algorithm able to compute optimal fixed group transit schemes with respect to the distribution of ships ’ speeds, we provide a real-world dataset with speeds of ships transiting the IRTC, we compare the optimal fixed schedules to the currently deployed schedule and quantify possible savings. Additionally, we propose on-demand group transit schemes—customized sched-ules for a group of arriving ships —that take into account speeds, risk aversion and actual positions of arriving ships. We formulate the problem of the optimal on-demand grouping as a bi-objective mixed integer program, and we compute a set of Pareto optimal solutions. We evaluate the scalability of the approach, the structure of the solution and quantify an improvement over the current group transit scheme with respect to the number of ships grouped as well as the time saved.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tracks of pigeons homing to the Frankfurt loft {{revealed}} an odd phenomenon: whereas birds {{returning from the}} North approach their loft more or less directly in a broad front, pigeons returning from the South choose, from 25 km from home onward, either of two corridors, a direct one and one with a considerable detour to the West. This implies differences in the navigational process. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Pigeons released at sites at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> westerly <b>corridor</b> and in this corridor behave just like pigeons returning from farther south, deviating to the west before turning towards their loft. Birds released at sites within <b>the</b> straight <b>corridors,</b> in contrast, take more or less straight routes. <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> short-term correlation dimension, a quantity reflecting <b>the</b> complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system and with it, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> factors involved in the navigational process, reveals that it is significantly larger in pigeons choosing <b>the</b> westerly <b>corridor</b> than in <b>the</b> birds flying straight - 3. 03 vs. 2. 85. The difference is small, however, suggesting a different interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same factors, with some birds apparently preferring particular factors over others. CONCLUSIONS: The specific regional distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factors which pigeons use to determine their home course seems to provide ambiguous information in the area 25 km south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loft, resulting in <b>the</b> two <b>corridors.</b> Pigeons appear to navigate by deriving their routes directly from the locally available navigational factors which they interpret in an individual way. <b>The</b> fractal nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> correlation dimensions indicates that <b>the</b> navigation process <b>of</b> pigeons is chaotic-deterministic; published tracks of migratory birds suggest that this may apply to avian navigation in general...|$|R
