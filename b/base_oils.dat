40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> type and viscosity on the frictional behaviour of lithium-thickened bearing greases. A series of model lithium greases were manufactured by systematically varying viscosity and type of <b>base</b> <b>oil,</b> so that {{the influence of}} a single <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> property could be studied in isolation. In addition, selected greases were blended with oleic acid, with the purpose of evaluating its effectiveness in further reducing grease friction. Friction coefficient and film thickness were measured in laboratory ball-on-disc tribometers over a range of speeds and temperatures. For a specific oil type, the influence of <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> viscosity on friction was found to be closely related to its effect on film thickness: greases formulated with PAO oils covering a wide range of viscosities gave very similar friction at the same nominal film thickness. For a given <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> viscosity, <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> type was found to have a strong influence on grease friction under all test conditions. PAO-based greases generally produced lower friction than mineral- and ester-based greases. Addition of oleic acid to the test greases did not significantly affect friction within the range of test conditions employed in this study. The results provide new insight into the frictional behaviour of greases, which may be used to help inform new low-friction grease formulations for rolling bearing applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} of three bio-lubricant <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> candidates with seventeen combinations of surface treatment was studied, comparing wear scar volumes and {{coefficient of friction}} results. Substrates were initially ground, then a combination of superfinished, Dymon-iC™ DLC, an impact technique of ultra-fine shot blasting method doped with Tin and Molybdenum Disulfide, a calcium based chemical dip containing calcium sulfate and nano fullerene, were used. DLC is well reported to reduce friction. Some reports suggest wear in coated contacts is independent {{of the type of}} lubricant used, whilst others report that bio-lubricants offer reduced friction and wear in combination with DLC. Shot blasting can also reduce wear and friction, due to the surface dimples acting as lubricant reservoirs, making hydrodynamic lubrication more likely. Previous work has also explored the performance of surface texturing in combination with coatings, some reporting higher friction when surface texturing and DLC is used. As a surface coating, fullerene has been shown to have significantly lower wear and friction than DLC coatings. The calcium based chemical treatment used has no published data. A ball on flat reciprocating wear tester was used with bio-lubricant <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> candidates, jojoba and soybean oil, with a mineral <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> used for comparison. Wear scars were analysed using a scanning electron microscope. Coefficient of friction results from testing with bio-lubricant <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> candidates’ soybean and jojoba oil were lower than tests with mineral <b>base</b> <b>oil.</b> A hybridized coating combination of superfinish, diamond like carbon and chemical dip gave the highest wear protection for tests with the mineral <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> and bio-lubricant <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> candidate soybean oil. A hybridized coating combination of superfinish, impact technique and chemical dip gave highest wear protection when tested with bio-lubricant <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> candidate jojoba oil. Results showed no overall improvement in wear protection when substrates were processed with the impact technique. Superfinishing substrates improved the performance of both the chemical dip and DLC...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Base</b> <b>oils</b> {{are used}} to {{manufacture}} products including lubricating greases, motor oil and metal processing fluids. Different products require different compositions and properties in the oil. One {{of the most important}} factors is the liquid’s viscosity at various temperatures. Whether or not a crude oil is suitable to be made into a base oil is determined by the concentration of base oil molecules as well as how easily these can be extracted. [...] Base oil is produced by means of refining crude oil. This means that the crude oil is heated in order that various distillates can be separated from one another. During the heating process, light and heavy hydrocarbons are separated - the light ones can be refined to make petrol and other fuels, while the heavier ones are suitable for bitumen and <b>base</b> <b>oils.</b> There are large numbers of crude oils all around the world that {{are used to}} produce <b>base</b> <b>oils.</b> The most common one is a type of paraffinic crude oil, although there are also naphthenic crude oils that create products with better solubility and very good properties at low temperatures. By using hydrogenation technology, in which sulfur and aromatics are removed using hydrogen under high pressure, you can obtain extremely pure <b>base</b> <b>oils,</b> which are suitable when quality requirements are particularly stringent. Chemical substances - additives - are added to the base oil {{in order to meet the}} quality requirements for the end products in terms of, for example, friction and cleaning properties. Certain types of motor oils contain more than twenty percent additives.|$|E

40|$|In this work, the {{recovery}} of <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> from lubricating oil contaminated soils was investigated using solvent extraction. Lubricating oils are discarded into the ground or landfills and this neither protects the environment nor conserves this important resource. Extraction of used lubricating oil from the contaminated soils can produce more valuable products and reduce environmental contamination.

The influence of particle size distribution, soil moisture and soil characteristics on <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> recovery were studied at a solvent-oil ratio of 1 : 2.

The soil-oil mixture was dissolved in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution at 40 oC while agitating at 300 rpm. During this stage, <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> separated from additives. A solvent was added to extract the <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> from the lubricating oil. Distillation was used to recover the solvent from the solvent-oil mixture.
