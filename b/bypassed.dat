40|$|AbstractObjective: Previous {{work has}} found {{cerebral}} oxygen extraction to decrease during hypothermic cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> in children. To elucidate cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> factors controlling cerebral oxygen extraction, {{we examined the}} effect of perfusate temperature, pump flow rate, and hematocrit value on cerebral hemoglobin-oxygen saturation as measured by near infrared spectroscopy. Methods: Forty children less than 7 years of age scheduled for cardiac operations with continuous cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> {{were randomly assigned to}} warm <b>bypass,</b> hypothermic <b>bypass,</b> hypothermic low-flow <b>bypass,</b> or hypothermic low-hematocrit <b>bypass.</b> For warm <b>bypass,</b> arterial perfusate was 37 ° C, hematocrit value 23 %, and pump flow 150 ml/kg per minute. Hypothermic <b>bypass</b> differed from warm <b>bypass</b> only in initial perfusate temperature (22 ° C); hypothermic low-flow <b>bypass</b> and low-hematocrit <b>bypass</b> differed from hypothermic <b>bypass</b> only in pump flow (75 ml/kg per minute) and hematocrit value (16 %), respectively. Cerebral oxygen saturation was recorded before <b>bypass</b> (baseline), during <b>bypass,</b> and for 15 minutes after <b>bypass</b> had been discontinued. Results: In the warm <b>bypass</b> group, cerebral oxygen saturation remained at baseline levels during and after <b>bypass.</b> In the hypothermic <b>bypass</b> group, cerebral oxygen saturation increased 20 % ± 2 % during <b>bypass</b> cooling (p < 0. 001), returned to baseline during <b>bypass</b> rewarming, and remained at baseline after <b>bypass.</b> In the hypothermic low-flow and hypothermic low-hematocrit <b>bypass</b> groups, cerebral oxygen saturation remained at baseline levels during <b>bypass</b> but increased 6 % ± 2 % (p = 0. 05) and 10 % ± 2 % (p < 0. 03), respectively, after <b>bypass</b> was discontinued. Conclusions: In children, cortical oxygen extraction is maintained during warm cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> at full flow and moderate hemodilution. <b>Bypass</b> cooling can decrease cortical oxygen extraction but requires a certain pump flow and hematocrit value to do so. Low-hematocrit hypothermic <b>bypass</b> and low-flow hypothermic <b>bypass</b> can also alter cortical oxygen extraction after discontinuation of cardiopulmonary <b>bypass.</b> (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1997; 113 : 71 - 9...|$|R
