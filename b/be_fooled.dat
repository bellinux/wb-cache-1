5|$|Diamond's high thermal {{conductivity}} {{is used by}} jewelers and gemologists who may employ an electronic thermal probe to distinguish diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist {{of a pair of}} battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds. However, older probes will <b>be</b> <b>fooled</b> by moissanite, a crystalline mineral form of silicon carbide introduced in 1998 as an alternative to diamonds, which has a similar {{thermal conductivity}}.|$|E

He mainly contributes to the SSS through intelligence gathering and other affairs but does not actively fight. Yuri herself says to not <b>be</b> <b>fooled</b> by his glasses {{and that he is}} actually an idiot. Though appearing to be slender, he works out and is actually well-built muscle-wise. After he first reveals this, he tends to take his shirt off, much to everyone's discomfort. He is absorbed by a shadow and is turned into an NPC. However, having strong enough feelings (according to Yuri), he is able to regain his senses and manages to disappear like the others. He carries a Desert Eagle as a side-arm, but is also seen using a Sig 552.|$|E

25|$|Melamine is {{sometimes}} illegally added to food products {{in order to}} increase the apparent protein content. Standard tests, such as the Kjeldahl and Dumas tests, estimate protein levels by measuring the nitrogen content, so they can be misled by adding nitrogen-rich compounds such as melamine. An instrument (SPRINT) developed by the company CEM Corp allows the determination of protein content directly in some applications; the instrument cannot <b>be</b> <b>fooled</b> by adding melamine in the sample.|$|E

She then transforms into a beautiful enchantress and turns the prince into a hideous Beast and his servants into various household objects. She gives him the rose to use as an hour-glass.

25|$|Diamond is an {{extremely}} effective thermal conductor and usually an electrical insulator. The former property is widely exploited {{in the use of}} an electronic thermal probe to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist of a pair of battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. As most simulants are thermal insulators, the thermistor's heat will not be conducted. This test takes about 2–3 seconds. The only possible exception is moissanite, which has a thermal conductivity similar to diamond: older probes can <b>be</b> <b>fooled</b> by moissanite, but newer Thermal and Electrical Conductivity testers are sophisticated enough to differentiate the two materials.|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers criticised the {{repetition}} of the game's levels. Francesco Serino (Eurogamer) criticised the variation between levels and said it wasn't too long before he was seeing similar levels because of the game's simplicity. He said that the levels are usually well made but are too often made for certain characters, which adds more gameplay {{because of the time}} it takes to discover the best strategies to complete a level. Alex Navarro (Giant Bomb) liked the overall gameplay of Monaco but disliked some of the later levels as they turned into [...] "tedious exercises in trial-and-error". Ben Allan (Gameplanet) said the single-player mode was less fun due to there being fewer variations and less chaos. Anton Bjurvald said that he fell in love with the simplicity of the graphics and liked the majority of the gameplay but said that it seemed like the game's artificial intelligence was made too easy to <b>be</b> <b>fooled.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Rajinikanth {{took part}} in a hunger strike {{organised}} by the Nadigar Sangam against Karnataka's stance on the Hogenakkal Falls water dispute. In his speech, which was well received in Tamil Nadu, he warned leaders not to inflame the water project issue for political gains and requested that the issue should be resolved soon. He reprimanded politicians in Karnataka and urged them [...] "to speak the truth" [...] to the public. [...] "They cannot <b>be</b> <b>fooled</b> and will not remain silent if you continue to act in such manner" [...] he stated. The speech led to Vatal Nagaraj, leader of the Kannada nationalist group Kannada Chaluvali Vatal Paksha, demanding an apology from Rajinikanth and threatening that he and his films would be boycotted from the state of Karnataka. The threats were echoed by other pro-Kannada organisations, such as the Karnataka Rakshana Vedike. He later thanked the Kannada film industry for allowing the release of Kuselan and lifting the ban the industry had briefly imposed on it. This led to strong reactions from Nadigar Sangam members R. Sarathkumar, Sathyaraj and Radha Ravi, who called the apology a disgrace to Tamils and opined that his speech never provoked the sentiments of the Kannada people.|$|E
