50|$|Bald Knob Cross, officially {{known as}} the Bald Knob Cross of Peace, is a large white cross located in Alto Pass, Illinois, United States. The {{structure}} is 111 ft tall. The base of the cross is 1,034 {{feet above sea level}} and overlooks the Shawnee National Forest. Originally completed in 1963, the cross itself stands 111 feet tall, is 22 feet square at the base, 16 feet square at the top and its arms extend 63 feet horizontally. The exterior white panels covering the cross are 4-inch architectural flat insulated metal panels while the <b>base</b> <b>portion</b> is covered in granite approximately 4-inches thick. The structure sits on a foundation of 730 tons of reinforced concrete that goes down 20 feet to bedrock. The steel framework weighs approximately 170 tons. Each of the four sides of the cross have a word inscribed into the granite: Peace, Hope, Faith, Charity.|$|E
50|$|The knifetooth sawfish {{grows to}} a maximum length of about 4.7 m. Its body is {{generally}} shark-like but its most obvious feature is the flattened head which is extended forward in a blade-like bony snout with, in Australian waters, 18 to 22 pairs of sideways-facing teeth, though elsewhere there may {{be as many as}} 25. These teeth are short and flat and are roughly triangular in shape. The blade does not taper towards its point and the basal quarter is devoid of teeth. The nostrils are narrow and partially concealed by nasal flaps. The skin of young sawfish is smooth but on older individuals it is sparsely covered in dermal denticles. The dorsal (upper) side of the fish is greyish and the ventral (lower) side a rather paler grey colour and the fins are also pale. The rostrum is grey with white teeth and sometimes has a chocolate-brown <b>base</b> <b>portion.</b>|$|E
50|$|Flowers of M. arborescens, {{consist of}} a spadix (typical to the family Araceae) which {{is a type of}} spike {{inflorescence}} having small flowers borne on a fleshy stem. The spadix of contains uni-sexual flowers without a perianth. The pistillate flowers are located in the <b>base</b> <b>portion</b> of the inflorescence, and the staminate flowers are located in the apical portion. In the zone between male flowers and female flowers there are also vestigial flowers. In a study done by M. Weber and H. Halbritter to examine M. arborescens pollen, their findings indicated that there is rapid pollen tube formation. The ultra structure of the pollen protoplast was characterized by many mitochondria, ER strands, dictyosomes, and microtubules. It seemed that they need quick germination since the wall is missing and thus a protective coating around the easily damaged pollen protoplast is absent. Further studies are needed to clarify how the pollen wall and pollen tube are formed. The representative molecular barcode of Montrichardia arborescens {{can be found at the}} Encyclopedia of life page.|$|E

50|$|Many anglers who catch a spotted bass mistake {{it for a}} largemouth due to the {{coloration}} {{although there}} are subtle differences. The spotted bass, like all black basses except the largemouth, has scales on the <b>base</b> <b>portion</b> of the second dorsal fin, its first and second dorsal fin are clearly connected, and its upper jaw bone does not extend back to or beyond the rear edge of the eyes. The spotted bass is also often confused with a smallmouth bass or smally for short, but it lacks the vertical bars that are present {{on the sides of}} the body of a smallmouth bass. The spotted bass also has small black spots below the lateral line unlike either the large or smallmouth bass. Juveniles often resemble the young of smallmouth bass in having a broad band of orange at the base of the tail, followed by a broad black band and white edge. The spotted bass is known to hybridize with the smallmouth, which sometimes makes identification difficult. Spotted bass can be found deeper than smallmouth bass at depths up to 100 ft.|$|E
50|$|Sioux Falls Regional Airport was {{originally}} laid out and constructed on its present site as an airfield in 1937. In early 1942, {{at the height}} of Second World War, the city approached the Federal Government and subsequently leased the airport and surrounding property to become the Sioux Falls Army Air Base. The major function of the base was the establishment of a radio operator training facility. Between 1942 and 1945, approximately 40,000 radio operators were trained in Sioux Falls. The base was also a logistical supply center and its grid of streets now make up a distinct industrial area just south of the present day airport. In 1946, the airport and surrounding land was transferred back to the city and the South Dakota Air National Guard was also established under the direction of future airport namesake Joe Foss. The Air National Guard <b>Base</b> <b>portion</b> of the airport is located south and west of the commercial and general aviation areas, north of Russell Street and has all the standard facilities of any small USAF installation except for family housing.
