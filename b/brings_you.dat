5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It <b>brings</b> <b>you</b> back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

25|$|It is {{that single}} word “usual” that <b>brings</b> <b>you</b> up short {{and lets the}} poem fan out. It points {{not just to the}} {{regularity}} of Robinson’s own days and years but to the engulfing possibility of a thousand Robinsons out there, in the subway and on the streets, all ticking their lives away like his soundless watch. The poem, entitled “Aspects of Robinson,” is the portrait of the postwar man of affairs: neither laborer nor magnate, but holding steady—and, at first blush, looking purposeful—within the middle rank. He is everything that Weldon Kees dreaded, as well as everything that he suspected he ought to be.|$|E
25|$|Sunshine Village offers terrain for {{all levels}} of skiers and boarders. It offers a mix of gentle tree lined {{beginner}} slopes, wide open above tree-line intermediate and expert terrain. Visitors to the resort will often access adjacent backcountry terrain such as 'Wawa Ridge' or Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park in British Columbia. Avalanche rescue equipment is recommended for most backcountry areas. Rescue equipment is a requirement {{for access to the}} freeride zones of Delirium Dive and Wild West where the entrances are via a gate which remains locked at all times unless it detects a working avalanche transceiver on each person that passes through it. The entrance for Wild West is located on Goats Eye Mountain while the entrance to Delirium Dive is located near the Great Divide. Sunshine also features a 5km ski-out which <b>brings</b> <b>you</b> from the village to the gondola base.|$|E

500|$|One {{poster for}} the film {{included}} the statement: [...] "Rick Baker, the new master of special effects, who brought you the magic of The Exorcist and gave you the wonder of King Kong, now <b>brings</b> <b>you</b> his greatest creation, The Incredible Melting Man". Although Baker assisted with the effects in The Exorcist (1973), Dick Smith was the makeup artist who primarily worked on that film, not Baker. Exorcist director William Friedkin was so angry about the poster that, upon seeing it on an associate's wall, he tore it down and ripped it to pieces. Baker, {{who did not know}} about the poster in advance, was horrified by the publicity campaign and publicly apologized for it, claiming: [...] "Dick wanted some help so I first went out to do some work on the dummy whose head turns around 360 degrees. I really didn't do anything creative, I just did labor".|$|E
500|$|Jasmyn Burke and Morgan Waters, {{who first}} met {{each other in}} a bar, started Weaves in 2012 when the two made demo songs based on files of song ideas Burke {{recorded}} on her iPhone. In 2013, bassist Zach Bines and drummer Spencer Cole joined the project and started recording their self-titled debut EP immediately after. [...] "Motorcycle", [...] "Take A Dip", [...] "Do You See Past" [...] and [...] "Hulahoop" [...] were produced by Waters in his bedroom using Garageband, while [...] "Buttercup" [...] and [...] "Closer" [...] was produced by David Newfeld in his church studio of Dobbstown North. Waters described Newfeld's production contributions as [...] "music lessons and artist lessons in a way," [...] given that {{he knew what he was}} making. He also said, [...] "That open mindedness and visibility to capture what happens in the moment and allow mistakes and encourage them <b>brings</b> <b>you</b> out of your comfort zone." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{screenplay}} {{was modified}} {{from its original}} draft form during the film's shooting. [...] Price himself suggested numerous dialogue changes for his character. [...] In the script, when Francis Barnard is first introduced to Nicholas, the young man asks about loud, strange noises he had heard a few moments earlier. [...] Don Medina responds: [...] "Uh...an apparatus, Mr. Barnard. (turning) What <b>brings</b> <b>you</b> to us?" [...] Price penciled in the suggestions [...] "that must be kept in constant repair" [...] and [...] "that cannot be stopped". [...] Later in the screenplay, when Nicholas recalls his father's chamber of torture, Price devised alternate explanations for Sebastian Medina's violence. [...] During Nicholas' death scene, after falling {{to the bottom of}} the pit the character originally had dialogue at the point of dying, asking in a voice of horror, [...] "Elizabeth. [...] What have I done to you? [...] (beat) [...] What have I done to you?" [...] The camera was to then cut directly to Elizabeth's face trapped in the iron maiden. [...] Corman decided to jettison the lines, believing that the film should remain purely visual at that point and dialogue would ruin the power of the scene.|$|E

2500|$|Jill Stein's {{impressive}} {{performance at}} the October 9 debate led to speculation that she could play a spoiler in the race by siphoning votes from O'Brien. [...] In an effort to prevent losing Democratic votes to Stein, Arlington School Committee member Paul Schlichtman purchased the rights to jillstein.org and diverted the page to omitmitt.com, which stated that [...] "A vote for Jill Stein just <b>brings</b> <b>you</b> {{four more years of}} Weld-Cellucci-Swift-Romney-Healey business as usual." [...] Robert Reich delivered a similar message to Democratic activists, saying that [...] "A vote for the Green Party is in effect a vote for the Republican Party".

2500|$|On October 16, 2014, {{as part of}} a {{stand-up}} comedy routine in Philadelphia, Hannibal Buress addressed Cosby's legacy of [...] "talk down" [...] to young black men about their mode of dress and lifestyle. Buress criticized the actor's public moralizing by saying, [...] "Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby, so that kind of <b>brings</b> <b>you</b> down a couple notches." [...] The audience appeared to respond to Buress's accusation as an incredulous joke before he encouraged everyone to [...] "Google 'Bill Cosby rape' [...] " [...] when they got home. Buress had been using the same Cosby routine for the previous six months with little response, but the October performance went viral after being posted on Philadelphia magazine's website. A media firestorm ensued, with numerous publications tackling the question of how Cosby had managed to maintain, as Buress called it in his routine, a [...] "teflon image" [...] despite {{more than a decade of}} public sex abuse accusations.|$|E

I kind of have an idea though, and it's very rough right now. So I'm very eager to start that." [...] Sean Garrett spoke on the album's sound saying it was [...] "a great mish-mash of genres". Rihanna revealed during an interview with GQ's [...] "Men of the Year" [...] that she wanted her music to be uplifting saying [...] "I want to make music that’s hopeful, uplifting.

2500|$|Gartside's {{change in}} beliefs {{directly}} affected {{the music and}} particularly the lyrics of Songs to Remember. In one interview with NME in October 1981 he told the paper, [...] "The politics have moved from an essentialist and reductionist position in which we believed in a history of science which could {{make sense of the}} future to one that realized that what you've got is needs, demands, and desires, and you go out and you fight for them. Which means that your music will at points be indexed fairly clearly to Politics with a big 'P' and at other points will cut across it completely." [...] In another interview with The Face the following year Gartside said, [...] "My loss has been political conviction, the idea of a correct understanding of the past, present and future (Marxism). I've always been obsessively concerned that my understanding of political truth should be scientifically grounded. Many songs [...] are about what happens when the anchor points of political, moral or religious understanding fall away." [...] For example, he stated that the track [...] "Faithless" [...] was about [...] "how living without faith <b>brings</b> <b>you</b> both happiness and sadness. I've never had any religion, except maybe politics, although I am interested in having some means of achieving social order and progress." ...|$|E
