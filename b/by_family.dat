5|$|According to Kaga, upon release Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light {{received}} extensive {{criticism from}} Japanese publications, with many noting {{that it was}} difficult to understand and had fairly poor graphics, awarding it low scores. In contrast, popular opinion was more positive: in a poll taken <b>by</b> <b>Family</b> Computer Magazine, the game scored 23.48 points out of 30. Likewise, sales of the game were flat for the first two months of sales, but improved after word of mouth had spread. According to Kaga, a notable journalistic writer devoted a Famitsu column to the game, and this prompted sales to pick up around half a year after release. As of 2002, Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light had sold 329,087 units, being the third best-selling title in the series to that date.|$|E
5|$|Adam (Peter Krause) is {{stressed}} {{about work}} because his boss Gordon (William Baldwin) feels {{he is too}} distracted <b>by</b> <b>family</b> issues. Sarah (Lauren Graham), frustrated with her children for losing their shoes, off-handedly remarks to Adam about her desire for a LoJack to help locate missing shoes. Put on the spot for new ideas at work, Adam pitches the LoJack idea and Gordon loves it, insisting Adam start developing it. When Sarah learns this later she is excited, but feels upset she is not given credit. When Zeek (Craig T. Nelson) encouraged her {{to stand up for}} herself, Sarah confronts Adam, but claims he has made many sacrifices for Sarah in the past and never asked for anything in return. Later, however, Adam tells Gordon it was Sarah's idea. That night, Adam apologizes to Sarah and offers her an internship at the company's design department, which she happily accepts.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted <b>by</b> <b>family</b> {{members of his}} former classmates, but upon arrival in Kigali he made contact with {{members of his own}} family. He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that his status as a well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest; on his second visit he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and social situation, and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.|$|E
