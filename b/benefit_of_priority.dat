However, the short-term <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> access to resources have not always translated into long-term <b>benefits</b> in terms <b>of</b> growth and survival. In the present study, we test whether dominant Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) that were able to monopolize a food source in laboratory conditions had a growth advantage over subordinates in their natural stream. There was no relationship between initial size and rank, and high-ranking individuals showed no growth advantage over subordinates over a 2 -month period when returned to the wild. A fish's growth rate in the wild was also unrelated to its sex or initial size, or the density of other salmon {{of the same age}} class within each experimental site. There was, however, spatial variability in growth, with salmon in one site gaining twice as much weight as did fish from the other sites. This suggests that at most of the sites, resources were limited in availability and that the absence of a relationship between growth and dominance rank was not owing simply to an excess of food being available. The lack of a positive correlation between social status and growth in the wild may be explained by several mechanisms, including the spatio-temporal variability in resources, interspecific interactions, fluctuations in habitat, or the presence of predators.

The range of conditions under which these priority methods can be implemented without causing any loss of capacity is quantified.

A benefit incidence analysis in Nigeria Obinna Onwujekwe 1, 2 *, Kara Hanson 3 and Benjamin Uzochukwu 1, 2, 4 Background: The paper presents {{evidence about the}} distribution <b>of</b> the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> public expenditures on a subset <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> public health services {{that are supposed to}} be provided free of charge in the public sector, using the framework <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> incidence analysis. Methods: The study took place in 2 rural and 2 urban Local Government Areas from Enugu and Anambra states, southeast Nigeria. A questionnaire was used to collect data on use <b>of</b> the <b>priority</b> public health services by all individuals in the households (n= 22, 169). The level of use was disaggregated by socio-economic status (SES), rural-urban location and gender. Benefits were valued using the cost of providing the service. Net benefit incidence was calculated by subtracting payments made for services from the value <b>of</b> <b>benefits.</b> Results: The results showed that 3, 281 (14. 8 %) individuals consumed wholly free services. There was a greater consumption of most free services by rural dwellers, females and those from poorer SES quintiles (but not for insecticide-treated nets and ante-natal care services). High levels of payment were observed for immunisation services, insecticide-treated nets, anti-malarial medicines, antenatal care and childbirth services, all of which are supposed to be provided for free. The net benefits were significantly higher for the rural residents, males and the poor compared to the urban residents, females and better-off quintiles. Conclusion: It is concluded that coverage of all <b>of</b> these <b>priority</b> public health services fell well below target levels, but the poorer quintiles and rural residents that are in greater need received more benefits, although not so for females. Payments for services that are supposed to be delivered free of charge suggests {{that there may have been}} illegal payments which probably hindered access to the public health services...|$|R
40|$|Priority {{queueing}} {{systems are}} oftentimes {{set up so}} that arriving customers are placed into one <b>of</b> N distinct <b>priority</b> classes. Moreover, to determine the order of service, each customer (upon arriving to the system) is assigned a priority level that is unique to the class to which it belongs. In static priority queues, the <b>priority</b> level <b>of</b> a class-k (k= 1, 2, [...] .,N) customer {{is assumed to be}} constant with respect to time. This simple prioritization structure is easy to implement in practice, and as such, various types <b>of</b> static <b>priority</b> queues have been analyzed and subsequently applied to real-life queueing systems. However, the assumption <b>of</b> constant <b>priority</b> levels for the customers may not always be appropriate. Furthermore, static priority queues can often display poor system performance as their design does not provide systems managers the means to balance the classical trade-off inherent in all priority queues, that is: reducing wait times <b>of</b> higher <b>priority</b> customers consequently increases the wait times for those <b>of</b> lower <b>priority.</b> An alternative to static priority queues are accumulating priority queues, where the <b>priority</b> level <b>of</b> a class-k customer is assumed to accumulate linearly at rate b_k> 0 throughout the class-k customer's time in the system. The main <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> accumulating <b>priority</b> queues is the ability, through the specification <b>of</b> the accumulating <b>priority</b> rates {b_k}_k= 1 ^N, to control the waiting times of each class. In the past, due to the complex nature of the accumulating prioritization structure, the control of waiting times in accumulating priority queues was limited [...] - being administered only through their first moments. Nowadays, with the advent of a very useful tool called the maximal priority process, it is possible to characterize the waiting time distributions of several types <b>of</b> accumulating <b>priority</b> queues. In this thesis, we incorporate the concept <b>of</b> accumulating <b>priority</b> to several previously analyzed static priority queues, and use the maximal priority process to establish the corresponding steady-state waiting time distributions. In addition, since static priority queues may be captured from accumulating priority queues, useful comparisons between the considered accumulating priority queues and their static priority counterparts are made throughout this thesis. Thus, in the end, this thesis results in a set of extensive analyses on these highly flexible accumulating priority queueing models that provide a better understanding of their overall behaviour, as well as exemplify their many advantages over their static priority equivalents...|$|R

This paper explores the potential interaction of emerging research areas, {{the first of which}} pursues climate change adaptation through spatial planning and the second of which has observed the neoliberalisation of urban planning, The potential capacity and form of spatial adaptation within the context a planning environment influenced by neoliberal principles is evaluated. This influence relates to the themes of spatial scale, temporal scale, responsibility for action, strategies and mechanisms, accrual <b>of</b> <b>benefits,</b> negotiation <b>of</b> <b>priorities</b> and approach to uncertainty. This paper presents a conceptual framework of the influence of neoliberalism on spatial adaptation and presents examples of this approach in documents which underpin adaptation in Australia. It identifies the potential characteristics and the challenges and opportunities of spatial adaptation under a neoliberal frame. The neoliberal frame does not entirely preclude spatial adaptation but significantly influence its form. Neoliberal approaches involve individual action in response to private incentives and near term impacts while collective action, regulatory mechanisms and long term planning is approached cautiously. Challenges concern the degree to which collective action and a long term orientation are necessary, how individual adaptation relates to collective vulnerability and the prioritisation of adaptation by markets. Opportunities might involve the operability of individual and local adaptation, the existence of private incentives to adapt and the potential to align adaptation with entrepreneurial projects. ...|$|R

The priorities, designated Attention Factors, are assigned by each sensor to its data packets, based on measurements of the system state. The Attention Factor represents a quantized value of the minimum risk in not transmitting a given measurement.
