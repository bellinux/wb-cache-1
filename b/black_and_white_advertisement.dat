5000|$|Lessard's Xeroxed {{copies of}} a mail order list added to {{underground}} 'zines circulating in the mid-to-late 1980s {{had a profound effect}} on the international noise communities, building interest in the music through minimal, very simple <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>advertisements.</b> Catalogs never included descriptions of bands or records, so a new reader was expected to either already know what they were getting, or else buy things at random. Many of today's noise artists learned about the genre in part by being exposed to RRRecords catalogs.|$|R

50|$|The Black & White Audiovisual Festival {{intends to}} {{celebrate}} the <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> aesthetics as a specific, peculiar and unique kind of artistic expression.

This proves the newness and interest in an aesthetic {{that can only be}} communicated through <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white.</b> Besides, the <b>Black</b> & White Audiovisual Festival also intends to promote the creation of soundscapes related with the <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> aesthetics.It is necessary to educate the audience to the <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> specificity, to avoid the prejudice that relates the <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> with fastidious <b>and</b> pretentious works.|$|R
