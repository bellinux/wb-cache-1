50|$|Pilot ACE used {{approximately}} 800 vacuum tubes. Its {{main memory}} consisted of mercury delay lines with an original capacity of 128 32-bit words, which was later expanded to 352 words. A 4096-word drum memory was added in 1954. Its <b>basic</b> <b>clock</b> <b>rate,</b> 1 megahertz, was the fastest {{of the early}} British computers. The time to execute instructions was highly dependent on where they were in memory (due {{to the use of}} delay line memory). An addition could take anywhere from 64 microseconds to 1024 microseconds.|$|E
5000|$|The FB-DIMM channel {{consists}} of 14 [...] "northbound" [...] bit lanes carrying data from memory to the processor and 10 [...] "southbound" [...] bit lanes carrying commands and {{data from the}} processor to memory. Each bit is carried over a differential pair, clocked at 12 times the <b>basic</b> memory <b>clock</b> <b>rate,</b> 6 times the double-pumped data rate. E.g. for DDR2-667 DRAM chips, the channel would operate at 4000 MHz. Every 12 cycles constitute one frame, 168 bits northbound and 120 bits southbound.|$|R

50|$|The myth arose {{because the}} <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> was {{commonly}} {{taken as a}} simple measure of processor performance, and was promoted in advertising and by enthusiasts without taking into account other factors. The term came into use {{in the context of}} comparing PowerPC-based Apple Macintosh computers with Intel-based PCs.

5000|$|System optimization: Some {{systems have}} [...] "bottlenecks", where small {{overclocking}} of one component can help realize the full potential of another component {{to a greater}} percentage than when just the limiting hardware itself is overclocked. For instance: many motherboards with AMD Athlon 64 processors limit the <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> of four units of RAM to 333 MHz. However, the memory performance is computed by dividing the processor <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> (which is a base number times a CPU multiplier, for instance 1.8 GHz is most likely 9×200 MHz) by a fixed integer such that, at a stock <b>clock</b> <b>rate,</b> the RAM would run at a <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> near 333 MHz. Manipulating elements of how the processor <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> is set (usually lowering the multiplier), it is often possible to overclock the processor a small amount, around 100-200 MHz (less than 10%), and gain a RAM <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> of 400 MHz (20% increase in RAM speed, though not in overall system performance).|$|R
5000|$|Manufacturers {{of modern}} {{processors}} typically charge premium prices for processors that operate at higher <b>clock</b> <b>rates,</b> a practice called binning. For a given CPU, the <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> are determined {{at the end}} of the manufacturing process through actual testing of each processor. Chip manufacturers publish a [...] "maximum clock rate" [...] specification, and they test chips before selling them to make sure they meet that specification, even when executing the most complicated instructions with the data patterns that take the longest to settle (testing at the temperature and voltage that runs the lowest performance). Processors successfully tested for compliance with a given set of standards may be labeled with a higher <b>clock</b> <b>rate,</b> e.g., 3.50 GHz, while those that fail the standards of the higher <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> yet pass the standards of a lesser <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> may be labeled with the lesser <b>clock</b> <b>rate,</b> e.g., 3.3 GHz, and sold at a lower price.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> {{alone is}} {{generally}} considered to be an inaccurate measure of performance when comparing different CPUs families. Software benchmarks are more useful. <b>Clock</b> <b>rates</b> can sometimes be misleading since the amount of work different CPUs can do in one cycle varies. For example, superscalar processors can execute more than one instruction per cycle (on average), yet {{it is not uncommon for}} them to do [...] "less" [...] in a clock cycle.

50|$|The {{goal of the}} {{experiment}} was to measure {{the rate at which}} time passes in a higher gravitational potential, so to test this the maser in the probe was compared to a similar maser that remained on Earth. Before the two <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> could be compared, the Doppler shift was subtracted out of the <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> measured by the maser that was sent into space, to correct for the relative motion between the observers on Earth and the motion of the probe. The two <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> were then compared and further compared against the theoretical predictions of how the two <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> would differ. The stability of the maser permitted measurement of changes in the rate of the maser of 1 part in 1014 for a 100-second measurement.|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a process for transferring digital data, in particular audio data, by means of which data is compressed in an encoder and then transmitted in encoded form, and decompressed and decoded in a decoder.

The input and output <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> are synchronized. The process according to the invention avoids this synchronization and is therefore applicable with much greater flexibility. The output <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> is supplied by a controllable oscillator independent of the input <b>clock</b> <b>rate.</b> The oscillator is controlled dependent on the internal processing state of the decoder, for example depending on the fill state of the internal data buffer. In a further version of the invention, the oscillator is controlled dependent on {{the difference between the}} volume of the data arriving in the decoder and extracted from the decoder.

40|$|Neotropical forests {{have brought}} forth a large {{proportion}} of the world`s terrestrial biodiversity, but the underlying evolutionary mechanisms and their timing require further elucidation. Despite insights gained from phylogenetic studies, uncertainties about molecular <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> have hindered efforts to determine the timing of diversification processes. Moreover, most molecular research has been detached from the extensive body of data on Neotropical geology and paleogeography. We here examine phylogenetic relationships and the timing of speciation events in a Neotropical flycatcher genus (Myiopagis) by using calibrations from modern geologic data in conjunction with a number of recently developed DNA sequence dating algorithms and by comparing these estimates with those based on a range of previously proposed molecular <b>clock</b> <b>rates.</b> We present a well-supported hypothesis of systematic relationships within the genus. Our age estimates of Myiopagis speciation events based on paleogeographic data are in close agreement with nodal ages derived from a ""traditional"" avian mitochondrial 2 %/My clock, while contradicting other <b>clock</b> <b>rates.</b> Our comparative approach corroborates the consistency of the traditional avian mitochondrial <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> of 2 %/My for tyrant-flycatchers. Nevertheless, our results argue against the indiscriminate use of molecular <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> in evolutionary research and advocate the verification of the appropriateness of the traditional <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> by means of independent calibrations in individual studies.
