25|$|The {{exhibition}} features rare statues, tools, jewels, mummies, {{a wooden}} body tag for a mummy, a stunning bronze {{statue of a}} princess, intact bird eggs and a 3000-year-old loaf of bread with a <b>bite-sized</b> chunk missing. The exhibition centrepiece is a bronze statue of the princess-priestess Takushit, dating to around 670BC. Standing 70cm high and wearing a gown covered in hieroglyphs, the statue was found south of Alexandria in 1880.|$|E
25|$|Benghazi {{is home to}} many {{distinctive}} {{dishes that}} can be prepared in the home. Bazin {{is one of the}} most well known of these dishes. Bazin is a dish consisting of a small loaf of heated dough and a meat or vegetable sauce. The dough can be ripped into <b>bite-sized</b> pieces and dipped into the sauce. This dish uses essential ingredients such as garlic and oil. Other dishes like Couscous are more well known around the world and adopted by other cultures. One common dessert that can be found in Benghazi is deep fried dates. These are often served with milk.|$|E
25|$|Food is {{prepared}} {{as if for}} an oven or stove top. However, because food cooks faster when it is in smaller pieces, food placed inside a solar cooker is usually cut into smaller pieces than it might otherwise be. For example, potatoes are usually cut into <b>bite-sized</b> pieces rather than roasted whole. For very simple cooking, such as melting butter or cheese, a lid may not be needed and the food may be placed on an uncovered tray or in a bowl. If several foods are to be cooked separately, then they are placed in different containers.|$|E
25|$|Lontong, {{popular in}} Indonesia and {{also can be}} found in Malaysia, is made of {{compressed}} rice that is then cut into small cakes. It is traditionally made by boiling the rice until it is partially cooked and packing it tightly into a rolled-up banana leaf. The leaf is secured and cooked in boiling water for about 90minutes. Once the compacted rice has cooled, it can be cut up into <b>bite-sized</b> pieces. The dish is usually served cold or at room temperature with sauce-based dishes such as gado-gado and salads, although it can be eaten as an accompaniment to other dishes such as Satay and curries.|$|E
25|$|The broth for {{the dish}} {{can be either}} a mixture of two broths, made from beef tripe and brisket, respectively, or gomtang, a thin soup with a rich flavor made by {{simmering}} beef bones for a long time. If choosing the first type, the beef tripe and brisket have to be boiled separately because beef tripe has strong flavor that can affect the brisket broth and the meat. To make the beef tripe broth, cleaned beef tripe, onions, scallions, garlic, and ginger are placed {{in a large pot}} with a large amount of water and boiled until thoroughly cooked. Likewise, the brisket broth is prepared using the same method, using the same secondary ingredients to remove any bad odors that might persist. After that, both broths are chilled, and any fat floating on the surface is skimmed off. The cooked brisket is cut into <b>bite-sized</b> pieces, while the yang and gopchang are cut into long, diagonal strips. The boiled beef tripe and brisket are marinated with seasonings and kneaded for a long time.|$|E
25|$|Prey {{is killed}} by hitting {{it with the}} hooked beak, aiming for the skull in vertebrates. If too large to swallow in {{one or a few}} chunks, it is transported to a feeding site by {{carrying}} it in the beak or (if too large) in the feet. The feet are not suited for tearing up prey, however. It is rather impaled upon a sharp point – thorns or the barbs of barbed wire – or wedged firmly between forking branches. Thus secured, the food can be ripped into <b>bite-sized</b> pieces with the beak. Orthoptera that the birds have recognized as containing noxious chemicals are left impaled in the larder for several days, until the chemicals that usually deter predators have been degraded. Great grey shrikes have also been observed to impale common toads (Bufo bufo) and skin them – by ripping open the back skin and pulling it over the head – to avoid contamination of the meat by the toxic skin secretions. Large bones and similar inedible parts of prey animals are usually not ingested, but smaller ones such as tiny bones or the elytra of beetles are eaten and later regurgitated as pellets.|$|E

Siberian borscht is eaten with boiled meatballs (...) of minced beef and onion. In Poland {{and parts of}} western Ukraine, borscht is typically ladled over , or <b>bite-sized</b> ear-shaped dumplings made from pasta dough wrapped around mushroom, buckwheat or meat filling. Mushroom-filled [...] are particularly associated with Polish Christmas Eve borscht.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Ode to a Koala Bear" [...] {{appears on}} the B-side of the 1983 Paul McCartney/Michael Jackson duet single Say Say Say. A koala is the main {{character}} in Hanna-Barbera's The Kwicky Koala Show and Nippon Animation's Noozles, {{both of which were}} animated cartoons of the early 1980s. Food products shaped like the koala include the Caramello Koala chocolate bar and the <b>bite-sized</b> cookie snack Koala's March. Dadswells Bridge in Victoria features a tourist complex shaped like a giant koala, and the Queensland Reds rugby team has a koala as its mascot. The Platinum Koala coin features the animal on the reverse and Elizabeth II on the obverse.|$|E
500|$|With {{subsequent}} episodes, reviews improved. The Boston Globe, comparing {{its debut}} episode ("a gloppy nostalgia trip that presented history the way MTV presents rock, in digestible, unrelated, bland <b>bite-sized</b> bits") to an episode airing {{less than five}} months later, found it [...] "light years ahead in terms of wit, style and historical perspective. It is still easily digestible, but there's nothing bland about it." [...] The St. Petersburg Times said of the show, [...] "It educated, {{but it was not}} school. It entertained, but it was not mindless. It was quality - television's noblest service." [...] The San Diego Union concurred, citing Our World as [...] "the most refreshing, fascinating and innovative history series ever on TV".|$|E
500|$|Regarding if {{they would}} break the fifth season into pods again as with season four, Bell said, [...] "A 22-episode arc is a lot for people to hold onto. By {{breaking}} it up into either smaller arcs or different pods, by introducing a set of antagonists and putting them down, or moving from space to space, our experience has been that it’s something the viewers enjoy, {{and it makes it}} a little easier to digest when you’re telling some of these stories." [...] Whedon also noted it would depend on how the season would be [...] "broken up in terms of airing. If everything is running back-to-back, it feels weird to start calling it different things... We will try to have it in <b>bite-sized</b> chunks." [...] The season will begin airing its episodes on December 1, 2017, once Inhumans has aired its eight episodes, with the intent for all 22 episodes to air mostly uninterrupted.|$|E
500|$|Hershey Creamery {{has been}} {{involved}} in multiple legal disputes with the similarly named Hershey Company, founded around the same time in Lancaster by Milton S. Hershey—no relation to the founding Hershey brothers. The first troubles came after the Hershey Creamery began producing chocolate candy and cocoa. Milton S. Hershey learned of the candies in 1919, and assigned Charles Ziegler to [...] "find instances of confusion and infringement and of unfair competition". Ziegler found that in addition to making similar products, the packaging used on the chocolates resembled that used by Hershey Company—then called Hershey Chocolate. Investigating complaints from retailers in Boston, New York, Binghamton, Norfolk, and Richmond, Ziegler reportedly found that retailers were confusing the two products, and sometimes deliberately replacing the higher priced Hershey Company products with the Hershey Creamery products. In Harrisburg, Ziegler found a display of Hershey Creamery [...] "Hershey Kisses", which were <b>bite-sized</b> chocolate drops similar to the chocolate company's creations. After cease and desist letters failed to resolve the problem, Milton Hershey filed suit in 1921 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania for trademark infringement. In 1926, a district judged partially sided with Hershey Chocolate and prohibited the creamery from using the name Hershey's in connection with [...] "manufacture, advertisement, distribution, or sale of, among other things, chocolate, cocoa, chocolate confections, and chocolate or cocoa products".|$|E
500|$|Alongside ghostwriter Don Moore, a pulp-fiction veteran, Raymond {{created the}} {{visually}} sumptuous science-fiction epic comic strip Flash Gordon. The duo also created the [...] "complementary strip, Jungle Jim, an adventurous saga set in South-East Asia", a topper which ran above Flash in some papers Raymond was concurrently illustrating Secret Agent X-9, which premiered January 22, 1934, {{two weeks after}} the two other strips. It was Flash Gordon that would outlast the others, quickly [...] "develop an audience far surpassing" [...] that of Buck Rogers. Flash Gordon, wrote Stephen Becker, [...] "was wittier and moved faster," [...] so [...] "Buck's position as America's favorite sci-fi hero", wrote historian Bill Crouch, Jr., [...] "went down in flames to the artistic lash and spectacle of Alex Raymond's virtuoso artwork." [...] Alex Raymond has stated, [...] "I decided honestly that comic art is an art form in itself. It reflects the life and times more accurately and actually is more artistic than magazine illustration—since it is entirely creative. An illustrator works with camera and models; a comic artist begins with a white sheet of paper and dreams up his own business—he is playwright, director, editor and artist at once." [...] A. E. Mendez has also stated that [...] "Raymond’s achievements are chopped into <b>bite-sized</b> pieces by the comic art cognoscenti. Lost in the worthwhile effort to distinguish comics as an art form, the romance, sweep and beauty of Raymond's draftsmanship, his incomparable line work, is dismissed. To many, it's just pretty pictures. Somehow or another, it's OK for people like Caniff and Eisner to borrow from film. That’s real storytelling. But for Raymond to study illustrators, well, that's just not comics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pica-pau is a breadless variant {{in which}} a steak is cut into <b>bite-sized</b> pieces and covered with sauce. The name pica-pau (woodpecker) {{references}} the traditional means of consumption with small skewers or toothpicks—making the diner [...] "peck" [...] at the dish.|$|E
2500|$|Hershey's Kisses is a {{brand of}} {{chocolate}} manufactured by The Hershey Company.

2500|$|Cheese curds: Fresh cheese curds {{are used}} to give the desired texture. The curd size may vary but is usually {{slightly}} smaller than <b>bite-sized.</b> Poutine cheese curds are different from regular ones {{in that they are}} not produced by cheddaring (weighting and pressing to squeeze out whey and to firm them). Instead, poutine's [...] "squeaky" [...] cheese curds are cooked, then allowed to cure to develop tanginess.|$|E
2500|$|Chimpanzees in the Nimba Mountains of Guinea, Africa, {{use both}} stone and wooden cleavers, {{as well as}} stone anvils, to chop up and reduce Treculia fruits into smaller <b>bite-sized</b> portions. These fruits, which can be {{the size of a}} [...] volleyball and weigh up to 8.5kg, are hard and fibrous. But, despite lacking a hard outer shell, they are too large for a {{chimpanzee}} to get its jaws around and bite into. Instead, the chimpanzees use a range of tools to chop them into smaller pieces. This is the first account of chimpanzees using a pounding tool technology to break down large food items into <b>bite-sized</b> chunks rather than just extracting it from other unobtainable sources such as baobab nuts. It is also the first time wild chimpanzees have been found to use two distinct types of percussive technology, i.e. movable cleavers against a non-movable anvil, to achieve the same goal. Neighbouring chimpanzees in the nearby region of Seringbara do not process their food in this way, indicating how tool use among apes is culturally learnt.|$|E
2500|$|An amuse-bouche ( [...] , [...] ) or amuse-gueule ( [...] , [...] ) is a single, <b>bite-sized</b> hors d’œuvre. Amuse-bouches are {{different}} from appetizers {{in that they are}} not ordered from a menu by patrons but are served gratis and according to the chef's selection alone. These, often accompanied by a complementing wine, are served both to prepare the guest for the meal and to offer a glimpse into the chef's approach to the art of cuisine.|$|E
2500|$|Dim sum (Jyutping: Dim2 sam1; Traditional Chinese: 點心, {{literally}} [...] "to {{touch the}} heart") is {{a characteristic of}} Cantonese cuisine, usually but not only eaten during yum cha. They are a set of small <b>bite-sized</b> portions of food served in small steam baskets or on small plates. In Cantonese teahouses, carts with dim sum will be moving around the restaurant for the diners to order from without having to leave their seats. In Cantonese traditions, the diners will often order dim sum at will while chatting and enjoying the endless serving of teas.|$|E
2500|$|In 1907, he {{introduced}} a new candy, <b>bite-sized,</b> flat-bottomed, conical-shaped pieces of chocolate that he named [...] "Hershey's Kiss". [...] Initially, they were individually wrapped by hand in squares of aluminum foil, {{and the introduction of}} machine wrapping in 1921 simplified the process while adding the small paper ribbon {{to the top of the}} package to indicate that it was a genuine Hershey product. [...] Today, 80 million of the candies are produced each day. [...] Other products introduced included Mr. Goodbar (1925), containing peanuts in milk chocolate, Hershey's Syrup (1926), semisweet chocolate chips (1928), and the Krackel bar containing crisped rice (1938).|$|E
2500|$|Oreo Mini, {{originally}} {{released in}} 1991, are <b>bite-sized</b> versions of ordinary Oreo cookies. After being discontinued {{in the late}} 1990s they were re-released in 2000 along with the redesigned 2001 Dodge Caravan {{as part of a}} promotional tie-in with DaimlerChrysler. Their 1990s packaging consisted of a [...] "miniaturized" [...] version of the full-size cardboard tray and box used in packaging at the time. Their current packaging consists of an aluminum foil bag.. Oreo Minis are also available, in original and golden varieties, in Nabisco To-Go Cups, lidded plastic cups which fit into car cup-holders, along with other Nabisco snacks in miniature form, such as Nutter Butters. In 2015, a new flavor of the Oreo Mini, mint, debuted.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{alligator}} has a heavy {{body and a}} slow metabolism, {{it is capable of}} short bursts of speed, especially in very short lunges. Alligators' main prey are smaller animals they can kill and eat with a single bite. They may kill larger prey by grabbing it and dragging it into the water to drown. Alligators consume food that cannot be eaten in one bite by allowing it to rot, or by biting and then spinning or convulsing wildly until <b>bite-sized</b> chunks are torn off. This is referred to as a [...] "death roll". [...] Critical to {{the alligator}}'s ability to initiate a death roll, the tail must flex to a significant angle relative to its body. An alligator with an immobilized tail cannot perform a death roll.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} famous dishes in Northeastern Chinese cuisine is Guo Bao Rou, a form of sweet and sour pork. It is a classic dish from Harbin which {{originated}} in the early 20th century in Daotai Fu (...) [...] It consists of a <b>bite-sized</b> pieces of pork in a potato starch batter, deep-fried until crispy. They are then lightly coated in a variation of a sweet and sour sauce, made from freshly prepared syrup, rice vinegar, sugar, flavoured with ginger, cilantro, sliced carrot and garlic. The Harbin Guobaorou is distinct from that of other areas of China, such as Liaoning, where the sauce may be made using either tomato ketchup or orange juice. Rather the Harbin style is dominated by the honey and ginger flavours and has a clear or honey yellow colour. Originally the taste was fresh and salty. In order to fete foreign guests, Zheng Xingwen, the chef of Daotai Fu, altered the dish into a sweet and sour taste. Usually, people prefer to go to several small or middle size restaurants to enjoy this dish, because it is difficult to handle the frying process at home.|$|E
2500|$|A {{combination}} of the climate and soils in the area has always made Te Puke a popular area for horticulture. From the 1880s tobacco was grown commercially but petered out in the late 1930s. Trial plantings of hops, and later rice, were also tried. Viticulture was also tried and found to be successful but for various reasons also died out. The settlers had established home orchards when finance permitted and {{it was found that}} pip and citrus fruits flourished. From this, the first commercial orchard in Te Puke was planted in 1915. Commercial plantings were of apples, pears, oranges, lemons and grapefruit. After World War Two, the Rehabilitation Department settled returned servicemen on the No 3 Road as orchardists. Followed by others with their own finance, most of No 3 Road was in orchards by 1960. By 1966, 80 owners owned about 1500 acres (6km²) of land of which [...] was in citrus and balance in sub-tropical fruit including tamarillos (tree tomatoes) and feijoas. In 1934 Jim MacLoughlin had bought a [...] lemon and passionfruit orchard in No 3 Road. His neighbour Vic Bayliss had two Chinese gooseberry plants and he had sold the fruit for £5! Spurred on by this Jim planted ½ acre of Chinese gooseberries in 1937. During World War II, American serviceman in New Zealand were introduced to the Chinese gooseberry and enjoyed it so much that this spurred further plantings. In 1952 the first exports were made, and in 1959 the name “Kiwifruit” was introduced. Since then many more plantings have been made with Hayward (green) being the most popular. In 1998 “Zespri Gold” kiwifruit was introduced to the market and experiments are being carried out on new varieties including a peelable kiwifruit and [...] "kiwiberry", a small <b>bite-sized</b> kiwifruit-like fruit.|$|E
