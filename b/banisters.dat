5|$|Ascending the {{staircase}} are bronze railings with mahogany <b>banisters.</b> The railings {{are decorated with}} the swastika symbol which, whilst mostly associated with Nazi Germany, has been traced {{back as far as}} the 3rd millennium B.C.E. in Asia. The stairway's newel posts, on the landing between the second and third floors, are a pair of bronze ram's heads, identical newel posts grace {{the bottom of the stairs}} as well. The second floor landing offers a view of the stained glass windows, all original, which were fully restored during the 1980s renovation. Elevator access is also located on the second floor landing, the elevator was a 1950s addition to the courthouse. Originally, to access the third floor, the only option was one of two staircases.

When the elevator was installed {{the staircase}} on the left-hand side of the landing was removed.|$|E

5|$|Six of the {{reductions}} were listed {{as part of}} the World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1990. The churches of San Ignacio de Velasco, Santiago de Chiquitos and Santo Corazón have been reconstructed from scratch and {{are not part of the}} World Heritage Site. In San Juan Bautista only ruins remain. UNESCO listed the site under criteria IV and V, acknowledging the adaption of Christian religious architecture to the local environment and the unique architecture expressed in the wooden columns and <b>banisters.</b> Recently ICOMOS, the International Council on Monuments and Sites, warned that the traditional architectural ensemble that makes up the site has become vulnerable following agrarian reforms from 1953 which threatened the fragile socioeconomic infrastructure of the region. At the time of the nomination, the World Heritage Site was protected by the Pro Santa Cruz committee, Cordecruz, Plan Regulador de Santa Cruz, and the local mayoral offices of the mission towns.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{out in a}} {{black and}} white frame (and later {{incorporating}} scenes of color), a group of girls are seen standing outside on the street while Bieber is seen exiting a building while trying to walk away without getting noticed. This however, is unsuccessful as the girls run up to Bieber; he then takes pictures and signs autographs with the girls. While this is happening Bieber takes an interest with one particular girl asking her to meet him later on, to which she agrees. As the song starts playing Bieber is seen sitting in an empty auditorium playing the piano and singing. When Bieber's date shows up they sneak into an empty theater where they are seen; holding hands, horsing around on the theater's seats, and sliding down <b>banisters.</b> At the ending of the video they are seen engaging in a playful back-alley water fight and eventually collapse into each other's arms while Bieber is playing the piano back inside the theater.|$|E
5|$|The soft organic {{material}} aboard and dispersed onto the seabed around the hull {{would have been}} the first to disappear, rapidly devoured by fish and crustaceans. Wood-boring molluscs such as Teredo colonized the ship's decks and interior in huge numbers, eating away the wooden decking and other wooden objects such as furniture, paneling, doors and staircase <b>banisters.</b> When their food ran out they died, leaving behind calcareous tubes. The question of the victims' bodies is one that has often troubled explorers of the wreck site. When the debris field was surveyed in Robert Ballard's 1986 expedition, pairs of shoes were observed lying next to each other on the sea bed. The flesh, bones, and clothes had long since been consumed but the tannin in the shoes' leather had apparently resisted the bacteria, leaving the shoes as the only markers of where a body had once lain. Ballard has suggested that skeletons may remain deep within Titanics hull, such as in the engine rooms or third-class cabins. This has been disputed by scientists, who have estimated that the bodies would have completely disappeared by the early 1940s at the latest.|$|E

500|$|Hogg and {{her younger}} {{brothers}} were rambunctious. She recalled that they particularly enjoyed sliding down the <b>banisters</b> in the Governor's Mansion. Hogg's parents allowed this to continue until Thomas cut his chin, after which Jim Hogg nailed tacks along {{the center of the}} railing to curb the activity through fear of bloodied posteriors; the holes from the tacks remained visible in the banister for many decades after the Hogg family moved from the home. Hogg's mother attempted to teach her ladylike skills such as needlework, but Hogg claimed that she [...] "never had the patience to succeed". Her mother also encouraged Hogg to learn German.

500|$|According to Paul Martin, Sr., {{by the end}} of the 1970s the Queen {{was worried}} that the Crown [...] "had little meaning for" [...] Pierre Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister. Tony Benn said that the Queen found Trudeau [...] "rather disappointing". Trudeau's {{supposed}} republicanism seemed to be confirmed by his antics, such as sliding down <b>banisters</b> at Buckingham Palace and pirouetting behind the Queen's back in 1977, and the removal of various Canadian royal symbols during his term of office. In 1980, Canadian politicians sent to London to discuss the patriation of the Canadian constitution found the Queen [...] "better informed... than any of the British politicians or bureaucrats". She was particularly interested after the failure of Bill C-60, which would have affected her role as head of state. Patriation removed the role of the British parliament from the Canadian constitution, but the monarchy was retained. Trudeau said in his memoirs that the Queen favoured his attempt to reform the constitution and that he was impressed by [...] "the grace she displayed in public" [...] and [...] "the wisdom she showed in private".|$|E

2500|$|It is {{pleasing}} {{that the}} principal areas of the building have been so little changed over the years, especially the entrance, the banking hall, the assembly room, the directors' room, the atrium, and the windows.

500|$|At a tryout {{conducted}} by professional scouts, <b>Banister</b> was noticed by the coaches at Lee College, {{a junior college}} in Baytown, Texas. They recruited <b>Banister</b> to play college baseball at Lee. While catching in a 1983 game, he suffered a collision at home plate, where the baserunner attempted to jump over him, and hit <b>Banister</b> {{in the head with}} his knee. The collision broke three of the vertebrae in his neck. <b>Banister</b> was not originally scheduled to play in that game; a scout for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB) told Lee's coach that he hoped to see <b>Banister</b> catch, which resulted in <b>Banister</b> being added to the starting lineup in a last-minute change. As a result of the collision, <b>Banister</b> was paralyzed from the neck down for ten days. Doctors initially warned him that he may never walk again. He had another three operations performed on his back and learned how to walk again during the 1984 season. Entering the hospital weighing , he weighed [...] when he was discharged. <b>Banister</b> recovered and played another season for Lee in 1985, and was named a Junior College All-American.

2500|$|To {{continue}} {{providing for}} the family after the fire, Nist and sons established the Queen City Box Manufacturing company and began production in October 1889.

2500|$|In the {{decorative}} arts section of the 1912 Salon d'Automne an architectural installation was exhibited that became known as Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), signed Raymond Duchamp-Villon and André Mare, along {{with a group of}} collaborators. La Maison Cubiste was a fully furnished house, or Projet d'Hôtel, with a staircase, wrought iron <b>banisters,</b> and a bedroom, and a living room—the Salon Bourgeois, where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Gleizes, Laurencin, Léger and Metzinger's Woman with a Fan were hung. It was an example of L'art décoratif, a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Spectators at the Salon d'Automne passed through the full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the ground floor of the Façade architecturale, designed by Duchamp-Villon. [...] "Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence", writes Christopher Green, [...] "creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers and Mare's old friends Léger and Roger La Fresnaye".|$|E
