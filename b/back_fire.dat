60|$|But the <b>back</b> <b>fire</b> was {{extending}} itself, {{so as to}} get round them. Every now {{and then}} Harry extended his own line, moving always forward toward Gangoil as he did so, though {{he and his men}} were always on Brownbie's territory. He had no doubt but that where he could succeed in destroying the grass for a breadth of forty or fifty yards he would starve out the inimical flames. The trees and bushes without the herbage would not enable it to travel a yard. Wherever the grass was burned down black to the soil, the fire would stop. But should they, who were at work, once allow themselves to be outflanked, their exertions would be all in vain. And then those wretches might light a dozen fires. The work was so hard, so hot, and often so hopeless, that the unhappy young squatter was more than once tempted to bid his men desist and to return to his homestead. The flames would not follow him there. He could, at any rate, make that safe. And then, when he had repudiated this feeling as unworthy of him, he began to consider within himself whether he would not do better for his property by taking his men with him on to his run, and endeavoring to drive his sheep out of danger. But as he thought of all this, he still worked, still fired the grass, and still controlled the flames. Presently he became aware of what seemed to him at first to be a third fire. Through the trees, {{in the direction of the}} river, he could see the glimmering of low flames and the figures of men. But it was soon apparent to him that these men were working in his cause, and that they, too, were burning the grass that would have fed the advancing flames. At first he could not spare the minute which would be necessary to find out who was his friend, but, as they drew nearer, he knew the man. It was the sugar planter from the mill and with him his foreman.|$|E

40|$|Free-burning {{experimental}} {{fires were}} conducted in a wind tunnel to explore the role of ignition type and thus fire spread mode on the resulting emissions profile from combustion of fine (< 6 mm in diameter) Eucalyptus litter fuels. Fires were burnt spreading with the wind (heading fire), perpendicular to the wind (flanking fire) and against the wind (<b>backing</b> <b>fire).</b> Greenhouse gas compounds (i. e. CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O) and CO were quantified using off-axis integrated-cavity-output spectroscopy. Emissions factors calculated using a carbon mass balance technique (along with statistical testing) showed {{that most of the}} carbon was emitted as CO 2, with heading fires emitting 17 % more CO 2 than flanking and 9. 5 % more CO 2 than <b>backing</b> <b>fires,</b> and about twice as much CO as flanking and <b>backing</b> <b>fires.</b> Heading fires had less than half as much carbon remaining in combustion residues. Statistically significant differences in CH 4 and N 2 O emissions factors were not found with respect to fire spread mode. Emissions factors calculated per unit of dry fuel consumed showed that combustion phase (i. e. flaming or smouldering) had a statistically significant impact, with CO and N 2 O emissions increasing during smouldering combustion and CO 2 emissions decreasing. Findings on the equivalence of different emissions factor reporting methods are discussed along with the impact of our results for emissions accounting and potential sampling biases associated with our work. The primary implication {{of this study is that}} prescribed fire practices could be modified to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from forests by judicial use of ignition methods to induce flanking and <b>backing</b> <b>fires</b> over heading fires...|$|R
30|$|While several {{different}} ignition patterns {{are used to}} affect fire behavior (Johansen 1987), these strategies remain largely unexplored in the fire and restoration literature. Our study suggests that fire ignition pattern influences fire severity and post-fire vegetation in Pacific Northwest prairies. Although average maximum surface temperature did not vary between the two ignition pattern treatments, a 10 -fold difference in residence time suggests that the duration of heating {{may be an important}} factor influencing vegetation response to ignition patterns. This reflects a fundamental difference between the behavior of head and <b>backing</b> fires: head <b>fires</b> spread rapidly among the tops of the grasses, spending less time on the surface, quickly influencing large acreages; <b>backing</b> <b>fires</b> have longer residence times, allowing more thorough combustion of plant material, typically over smaller areas (Keeley 2009). This pattern aligns well with our finding at Glacial Heritage that <b>backing</b> <b>fires</b> were more severe compared to head fires.|$|R

However, practitioners must use the proper <b>firing</b> technique (e.g., <b>backing</b> <b>fire,</b> flanking fire, or strip-heading fire) to avoid injuring or killing overstory trees, and season of burning should be considered.|$|R

30|$|Ignition {{patterns}} {{could influence}} fire intensity, severity, and vegetation response to fire {{for a number}} of reasons. First, <b>backing</b> <b>fires</b> and head fires create fundamentally different types of fire. Head fires are flashy, wind-driven fires with short residence times, high rates of spread, and longer flame lengths. <b>Backing</b> <b>fires</b> are primarily fuel-driven fires, with long residence times, low rates of spread, and shorter flame lengths. These differences could have specific first- and second-order impacts on community response. In grasslands, fire intensity (as measured by maximum surface temperatures) and severity (as measured by organic matter removed) are likely to be higher in <b>backing</b> <b>fires</b> than in head fires. Variation in maximum temperatures and heating time {{as a result of the}} ignition pattern could have direct impacts on plant tissue death and indirect impacts on seed germination the following season. These impacts may differ based on plant life form and origin; perennials with buds less than 2 cm belowground are much more susceptible to direct fire impacts than annuals with a sufficient seed bank or long-lived woody species with insulating bark (Pyke et al. 2010). Additionally, fire-adapted native plant species may be more resistant to longer duration or higher temperature fires that are required to remove introduced species (DiTomaso et al. 2006), providing an opportunity to utilize certain ignition patterns for invasive control. For these reasons, managers may use different ignition patterns during a prescribed burn to influence fire behavior, severity, and community response (Kilgore and Curtis 1987, Van Wilgen et al. 2004).|$|R
50|$|Modern pump shotgun designs, {{such as the}} Remington 870 and Mossberg 500, have {{a safety}} feature called a trigger disconnector, which {{disconnects}} the trigger from the sear as the bolt moves back, so that the trigger must be released and pulled again to fire the shotgun after it closes. Many early pump shotguns, such as the Winchester 1897, did not have trigger disconnectors, and would, if the trigger were held <b>back,</b> <b>fire</b> immediately upon closing. Due to the higher rate of fire that this allows, some shooters prefer models without this feature, such as the Ithaca 37, Stevens Model 520/620, and Winchester Model 12.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Field Artillery Team' is a US {{term and}} the {{following}} description and terminology applies to the US, other armies are broadly similar but differ in significant details. Modern field artillery (post-World War I) has three distinct parts: the forward observer (or FO), the fire direction center (FDC) and the actual guns themselves. The forward observer observes the target using tools such as binoculars, laser rangefinders, designators and call <b>back</b> <b>fire</b> missions on his radio, or relays the data through a portable computer via an encrypted digital radio connection protected from jamming by computerized frequency hopping.

In any case, Pagondas sent his cavalry to support the Boeotian left wing and the Athenians were defeated in turn. Meanwhile, the Boeotian right wing was also victorious, and the Athenians fighting there fled; when the Athenian centre saw that their two wings had been defeated they also fled. About 500 Boeotians and 1,000 Athenians had been killed, including Hippocrates.|$|E
