50|$|In {{the months}} {{after the release of}} Dance Dance Revolution, Konami offered free {{downloads}} for the game on the product website. The free downloads consisted of additional dancing character that were displayed during game play. The characters ranged from general styles (Club DJs, trendy outfits) to odd and seasonal styles (Bondage gear, Christmas dresses, Halloween costumes, Robots). The download page displayed blank entries for up and coming downloads. The nature of the new dancers were revealed when the downloads were posted. Dancing characters were released as pairs (Usually {{a man and a woman}} when gender even applied), however the final <b>blank</b> <b>entry</b> was a lone dancing character instead of a pair. The final character was a bonus character named Jason, that replaced Guy, a previous downloadable character.|$|E

30|$|The data {{collated}} {{from the}} Pfizer, GSK, and Sanofi solvent selection guides produces {{a number of}} conclusions. The greenest solvents (i.e., those with three green shaded entries or two green entries and a <b>blank</b> <b>entry</b> in Figs.  6 and 7) are water, n-propyl acetate, i-propyl acetate, 1 -butanol and 2 -butanol. This set is severely limited, with only alcohols and esters featuring alongside water as being recognised across the board as green solvents. This conclusion is {{in agreement with the}} ETH Zurich and Rowan University tools. Conclusions can also be drawn regarding the least desirable solvents. The following solvents are unequivocally considered as undesirable if not already banned (i.e., at least two red or black shaded entries in Figs.  6 and 7, no yellow or green entries): chloroform, 1, 2 -DCE, carbon tetrachloride, NMP, DMF, DMAc, benzene, hexane, 1, 4 -dioxane, 1, 2 -DME, diethyl ether, and 2 -methoxyethanol. This set rules out many of the dipolar aprotic, chlorinated, hydrocarbon and ether solvents. Chemists should be careful when using these types of solvent and consider the EHS implications of their choice. 2 -Methyltetrahydrofuran (2 -MeTHF) and tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME) are preferable to THF and diethyl ether in this regard. Where there are no green options within a solvent class it is clear that only under unusual circumstances could one of the green solvents noted above replace the red or black-listed solvents without a substantial re-engineering of the process. As an added complication the three solvent selection guides shown in Figs.  6 and 7 do not always agree. For example acetonitrile reaches a different outcome in each of the solvent selection guides.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, several {{publications}} discussed a new method of matrix completion, called matrix abduction, which is particularly useful {{in the context of}} Talmudic logic and legal ruling systems in general. Given a matrix AA with entries that are either in { 0, 1 }{ 0, 1 } or blank, the method allows us to decide whether each <b>blank</b> <b>entry</b> should be 0 or 1, or remain undecided. Unlike existing matrix completion methods, which are based on notions of analogy using distance (analogy to nearest neighbors), the new method takes a different approach and completes the matrix using only topological criteria; as a result, the outcome of the process is often significantly different. This chapter will focus specifically on one of these criteria, involving the representation of the finite partially ordered set as minimally generated multisets (ordered by inclusion) {{for which there is no}} known exact polynomial-time evaluation algorithm. We examine the existing efficient greedy algorithm for this criteria, its connection the similar known concepts dimension and two dimension of a poset (partial ordered set) then derive new useful properties and an algorithm. We start by proving that the exact evaluation of the criteria is NP-complete both in the general case and in the limited context of matrix abduction. We then discuss one-point removal properties of the problematic criteria, which may aid in solving specific cases and be utilized by new algorithms. Finally, we present a new greedy algorithm that offers a significant improvement over the existing one, and discuss the possibility of reusing existing algorithms that approximate 2 -dimension of a poset...|$|E
50|$|Some <b>entries</b> {{are left}} <b>blank</b> {{and others are}} marked with unknown. The {{difference}} here is that <b>blank</b> <b>entries</b> refer to attributes where the value is just not known. Unknown entries, however, indicate that no information about this attribute {{is available in the}} database itself. As an example, in the Jupiter weather database no information about the origin of the speakers is given. Therefore this data would be less useful for verifying accent detection or similar issues.|$|R

50|$|The rows of Pascal's {{triangle}} are conventionally enumerated {{starting with}} row n = 0 {{at the top}} (the 0th row). The entries in each row are numbered from the left beginning with k = 0 and are usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows. The triangle may be constructed in the following manner: In row 0 (the topmost row), there is a unique nonzero entry 1. Each entry of each subsequent row is constructed by adding the number above {{and to the left}} with the number above and to the right, treating <b>blank</b> <b>entries</b> as 0. For example, the initial number in the first (or any other) row is 1 (the sum of 0 and 1), whereas the numbers 1 and 3 in the third row are added to produce the number 4 in the fourth row.|$|R

25|$|The PREP is a {{mechanism}} to make public {{the results of the}} election. As soon as the polls closed and the votes were tallied in each polling place, a copy of the acta de escrutinio (the official tallies from the polling place) was sealed in a special envelope with a transparent window. It was then sent to a Center for Information Collation and Transmission (Centro de Acopio y Transmisión de Datos or CEDAT) that was located in the corresponding electoral district. There, the information was captured and transmitted to the central offices of the IFE for public dissemination. The information was then backed up and made public on the IFE website and a number of mirrors. The PREP is not an estimate or a statistical exercise, but rather the full unofficial returns from each polling place, as they were computed at the polls {{on the day of the}} election. They are not official returns, since the tallies must be certified by the District's Electoral Council before they become official. The PREP would continue to collate data until all polling places reported or until the early morning hours of Monday July 3. If the tally sheets contained certain inconsistencies (e.g., <b>blank</b> <b>entries</b> rather than zeros, illegible totals, etc.), then they were reported separately, under the heading of Irregular, as per prior agreement between the parties, and were not added to the totals as they were received. Where possible, their results were added when the final report was made on Monday morning.|$|R

In contrast to that incredible speed, the average {{speed of the}} actual racing event was a meager 92.881 mph. Seventeen laps in this event were run at reduced speeds {{as a result of}} the yellow caution flag. Some of the notable owners in this race were Herb Thomas, Frank Christian and Bob Griffin. More than half the grid failed to finish the race; even mighty Herb Thomas himself had stock car engine problems on lap 354 that ultimately nailed him at a respectable fifth-place finish. Five drivers were declared to be [...] "null" [...] entries by NASCAR because they didn't submit their <b>entry</b> <b>blanks</b> within a reasonable period of time.

25|$|Due to the {{publicity}} thus created, Speedway management, which {{had for the}} previous two seasons of meets charged the effectively nominal entry fee of one dollar per mile of scheduled race distances, took measures {{to ensure that the}} likely large entry list did not include any that were frivolous: at an accordingly heightened fee of $500 per car, participation became a nominally risky proposition to teams and manufacturers, since, although the high finishers were due to receive record purse money and accessory prizes, no money at all was offered to finishers below tenth place. Interest, however, was far from dampened, with <b>entry</b> <b>blanks</b> distributed {{over the course of the}} following month quickly returning filled, the first of which being an automobile built by the J.

50|$|In {{preparation}} for the race, NASCAR held several test sessions on March 12−13, 2002 at the track for teams {{to prepare for the}} event. The first day's testing session was due to begin at 9 a.m. EST, and conclude at 5:00 p.m. EST but rain forced the session to be postponed to March 13. Rain continued on the second day, which forced most teams to leave without completing any testing, but drivers such as Mike Skinner were able to get limited running in their cars. NASCAR implemented a new pit-road procedure for the race during caution periods where drivers where required to enter pit road in turn two and exit at turn one. Drivers who violated this rule could have potentially received a stop-and-go penalty or rejoin {{at the rear of the}} nearest longest line. Beginning at the race, teams applying for provisionals after qualifying would not be charged if the entry field for a NASCAR sanctioned event was less or equal than the number of starting entries provided by the official <b>entry</b> <b>blank.</b>|$|R
40|$|Assorted new {{features}} and bug fixes, including data upload improvements This {{is the first}} major release in three months. Changes Pertinent to PEcAn Users Administrators may {{need to do a}} database migration. If the BETYdb 4. 14 - hotfix release was deployed, no migrations are necessary. See "Database Changes" below. Summary of Changes New Features Issue # 466 Add support for an entity column in CSV files for Bulk Upload. An "entity" column heading in bulk upload CSV files is now recognized. The value in the column becomes the name of the entity to be used for all traits in the row. If the name matches an existing entity, that entity is re-used; otherwise a new entity will be inserted. Issue # 471 Add "experiments" view, show, and edit pages. The experiments table is now viewable and editable via the BETYdb Web interface. The BETYdb Rails application is now aware of the association between experiments and sites. In the beta API, using the "key" parameter is now optional. This is a convenience for users trying out the API in a browser: they now merely need to be logged in and don't need to include "key=" in the query string. Those using the API programmatically need not use the "key" parameter either if they supply a username and password. Issue # 432 In API, 'associated ids' should be optional (off by default) A new parameter "associations_mode" affords control over how much information about associated tables to display. Recognized values include count (show the number of rows in another table that are associated with this item), ids (show a list of the ids of those rows), and _full_info_ (show complete information about each associated item). Extensions to site customization options: Whether or not to show the Model I/O menu item can now be set in the application. yml file. What place-holder text to show in the home page's search box can now be set in the application. yml file. The citation/license/copyright and contact information included in CSV downloads now matches the (customizable) information displayed in the Web page footer (part of issue # 482) Issue # 482 Errors in search [...] > download, output csv In addition to site-appropriate citation information, downloaded CSV files now include a "raw_date" field in addition to the interpreted date previously provided. Although "raw_date" can easily be misinterpreted, it may prove useful for some use cases. Issue # 459 Change bulk upload (via wizard or API) to allow for traits not in the trait_covariate_associations table Any variable name used as a heading in a CSV data file that does not conflict with any of the usual heading names and is not listed as a covariate in the trait_covariate_associations table will now be recognized as a trait variable name. It is now also an error for there to be a heading that matches a recognized covariate name unless there is a matching trait name in the heading. Improved and additional RSpec testing of trait-insertion API and Bulk Upload wizard. Bug Fixes Issue # 472 There is an HTML class that is alternately spelled "final_paginate_row" or "final_paginagte_row". For the most part, this has had no user-viewable effects. Pull Request # 478 Typo in 401 message It now says "authentication" instead of "authenication". Issue # 479 species vs specie in new API Species (singular and plural) are now referred to as such in API results. Issue # 485 Bulk Upload doesn't handle <b>blank</b> <b>entries</b> in "notes" column. Previously either the "notes" column had to have a non-blank value in each row or the "notes" column had to be omitted altogether (in which case each trait inserted would have a blank note). Now it is possible to have notes for some but not all traits in the file. Other Changes The changes from [URL] have been merged into the master branch. These changes {{have to do with the}} experiments table and related database tables and objects. Steps Needed for Upgrade Database Changes Administrators may need to do database migrations! If BETYdb 4. 14 - hotfix was deployed, no migrations are needed. If you are upgrading from the BETYdb 4. 14, then there is one migration which needs to be run. The database version for this release is 20170118205944. Gem Installation No new Gems need be installed. Status of RSpec Tests All non-pending tests pass when run in the default environment. (There is one pending test having to do with site-group editing permissions.) The tests can be run using the command bundle exec rspec Complete details for running the rspec tests are at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Waiting time {{is one of}} {{the factors}} {{affecting}} patient satisfaction of service quality which is offered. In This Study waiting times referred to some clinics like Shahid Dastani integrated clinical training center, treatment and researching center like Shariati Hospital was performed. Materials and Methods: Six sigma model in four stages together with qualitative and quantitative methods was used in this study. The study population consisted of the all patient referred to specialist clinics like Shahid Dastani during every week. We selected 10 % of all patients as a sample size referred to specialist clinics (n= 266). Data were collected by interviewing and filling the checklists using a stopwatch. Measured waiting times were registered in a <b>blank</b> form. Data <b>entry</b> and analysis were performed using SPSS. Results: Mean and standard deviation of waiting time were 121 ± 33. 73 minutes. The most important processes from referred entrance to leaving the physician's office consisted of comprehensive workflow processes, overall workflow, times forming, funds, medical records, previous bloom times, refunds and discount at all costs, and complaints. Conclusion: The first three factors of prolonged time form health care providers and referees view are simultaneous {{increase in the number of}} referees, physicians being on time and shortage of doctors. This collection extends the time of giving services by clinice, providing human resources and modifying the physical spaces wich were some of recommendations to reduce waiting times...|$|R
