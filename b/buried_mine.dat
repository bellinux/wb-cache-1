The offensive's forward progression was again slowed by the use of large ambushes initiated by deep-buried mines or car bombs. One such ambush, on 5 April, resulted in a Bradley fighting vehicle being destroyed and the death of one American soldier. Of note, Army medic Christopher Waiters was eventually awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his heroic actions that day which saved the lives of two additional American soldiers in the destroyed Bradley vehicle.

In the integration, the absence of interferences with the conventional, contact technique of hand-probe use was emphasized. The characteristics of <b>buried</b> <b>mines</b> severely restrict hand-probe manoeuvrability and rate of additional information collectable within reasonable time, thereby lowering quality of the hand-probe-buried object contact. Additionally, the hand-probe penetration through the soil imposes restrictions on the applicable designs of hand-probe tip. All these restrictions influence the characteristics of the piezoelectric sensing part, which must on the one hand provide the operator with a signal of signal-noise ratio sufficiently high to make possible extraction of a statistically significant quantity of information about the buried object material, {{and on the other hand}} be as robust as possible, i. e., utilizable in a rather broad palette of mine-soil systems.

DESIGN [...] Retrospective analysis. SETTING [...] Two hospitals for patients injured in war. SUBJECTS [...] 757 patients with injuries from antipersonnel mines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Distribution and number of injuries; number of blood transfusions; number of operations; disability. RESULTS [...] Pattern 1 injury results from standing on a <b>buried</b> <b>mine.</b> These patients usually sustain traumatic amputation of the foot or leg; they use most surgical time and blood and invariably require surgical amputation of one or both lower limbs. Pattern 2 injury is a more random collection of penetrating injuries caused by multiple fragments from a mine triggered near the victim. The lower limb is injured but there is less chance of traumatic amputation or subsequent surgical amputation. Injuries to the head, neck, chest, or abdomen are common. Pattern 3 injury results from handling a mine: the victim sustains severe upper limb injuries with associated face injuries. Eye injuries are common in all groups.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we apply}} a deflection-optimal linear-quadratic {{detector}} to {{the detection of}} <b>buried</b> <b>mines</b> in images formed by a forward-looking ground-penetrating synthetic aperture radar. The detector is a linear-quadratic form that maximizes the output SNR (deflection), and its parameters are estimated from a set of training data. We show that this detector is useful when the signal to be detected {{is expected to be}} stochastic, with an unknown distribution, and when only a small set of training data is available to estimate its statistics. The detector structure can be understood in terms of the singular value decomposition; the statistical variations of the target signature are modeled using a compact set of orthogonal “eigenmodes” (or principal components) of the training dataset. Because only the largest eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors contribute, statistical variations that are underrepresented in the training data do not significantly corrupt the detector performance. The resulting detection algorithm is tested on data that are not in the training set, which has been collected at government test sites, and the algorithm performance is reported.
