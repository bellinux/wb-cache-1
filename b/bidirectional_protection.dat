It is very difficult and complicated to handle the interconnection issues for proper <b>bidirectional</b> <b>protection</b> coordination in distribution systems interconnected with DG, because professional skills and enormous amounts of data for the evaluations are required. In order to overcome these problems, the paper proposes reasonable and general evaluation algorithm for bi-directional protection coordination and presents an evaluation system based on the algorithm algorithms and systems using the HMI software.

40|$|CpG island {{methylation}} within single gene promoters can silence {{expression of}} associated genes. We first extended these studies to bidirectional gene pairs controlled by single promoters. We showed that hypermethylation of bidirectional promoter-associated CpG island silences gene pairs (WNT 9 A/CD 558500, CTDSPL/BC 040563, and KCNK 15 /BF 195580) simultaneously. Hypomethylation of these promoters by 5 -aza- 22 ̆ 7 -deoxycytidine treatment reactivated or enhanced gene expression bidirectionally. These results were further confirmed by luciferase assays. Methylation of WNT 9 A/CD 558500 and CTDSPL/BC 040563 promoters occurs frequently in primary colon cancers and acute lymphoid leukemia, respectively. ^ Next {{we sought to}} understand the origins of hypermethylation in cancer. CpG islands associated with tumor suppressor genes are normally free from methylation, but can be hypermethylated in cancer. It remains poorly understood how these genes are protected from methylation in normal tissues. In our studies, we aimed to determine if cis-acting elements in these genes are responsible for this protection, using the tumor suppressor gene p 16 as a model. We found that Alu repeats located both upstream and downstream of the p 16 promoter become hypermethylated with age. In colon cancer samples, the methylation level is particularly high, and the promoter can also be affected. Therefore, the protection in the promoter against methylation spreading could fail during tumorigenesis. This methylation pattern in p 16 was also observed in cell lines of different tissue origins, and their methylation levels {{were found to be}} inversely correlated with that of active histone modification markers (H 3 K 4 - 3 me and H 3 K 9 -Ac). To identify the mechanism of protection against methylation spreading, we constructed serial deletions of the p 16 protected region and used silencing of a neomycin reporter gene to evaluate the protective effects of these fragments. A 126 bp element was identified within the region which exerts <b>bidirectional</b> <b>protection</b> against DNA methylation, independently of its transcriptional activity. The protective strength of this element is comparable to that of the HS 4 insulator. During long-term culture, the presence of this element significantly slowed methylation spreading. In conclusion, we have found that an element located in the p 16 promoter is responsible for protection against DNA methylation spreading in normal tissues. The failure of protective cis-elements may be a general feature of tumor-suppressor gene silencing during tumorigenesis. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper introducess an {{implementation}} of the network coding-based generalized 1 +N protection technique presented earlier by the author in [1] to protect against single link failures. Instead of using two protection circuits {{for a group of}} connections which are to be protected together as in [1], only one protection circuit is used, which {{takes the form of a}} tree. The protection circuit carries linear combinations of the data units originally transmitted on the working circuits, and these linear combinations can be used to recover lost data due to link failures. This recovery is carried out with the assistance of one node on the protection tree, which is chosen to reduce the recovery time. Moreover, unlike the scheme in [1] which protects unidirectional connections, this scheme is used to protect <b>bidirectional</b> connections. This <b>protection</b> technique requires exactly the same amount of protection resources used by 1 :N protection, and can therefore be considered as a step towards achieving optimal 1 +N protection. The paper also makes a number of other contributions. It introduces an Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation to evaluate the cost of protection using this technique, and compares it to the cost of 1 + 1 protection. The comparison shows that a significant saving in cost can be achieved, while still recovering from failures within a short time. In addition, it introduces an {{implementation of}} this scheme using MPLS...|$|R
40|$|Advanced Plasma Material Interaction (PMI) science {{requires}} in-situ {{time and}} space-resolved measurements {{over a large}} area of Plasma Facing Component (PFC) surfaces to study fuel retention & recovery, erosion & redeposition, material mixing, etc. A novel PFC diagnostic technique Accelerator-based In-situ Materials Surveillance (AIMS) has been developed for Alcator C-Mod. At present, the AIMS covers a relatively small (35 cm) poloidal section of the inner wall PFCs at a single toroidal angle; an upgrade has been proposed which will enable nearly full poloidal (124 cm) and 40 degree toroidal PFC coverage. This paper introduces the design, analysis and fabrication of the new TF magnet power supply system for this upgrade. First, {{the design of the}} busbar system and its support structure is described, which are required to carry 15 kA current for long pulse operation of up to 25 minutes and fault condition of 400 kA for 1 second. Additional elements in the power supply system include a <b>bidirectional</b> crowbar, varistor <b>protection</b> assemblies, and a high current bus switch. Secondly, multi-physics analyses involved in the design are presented. Electro-magnetic analysis is performed to evaluate the spreading load of the two current-carrying busbars while Joule heating with thermal racheting analysis is to estimate the temperature rise in the components. Structural analysis taking into account dead weight, thermal expansion, spreading load and seismic load is performed. All analyses are completed using finite element analysis software COMSOL. Analytical calculations are included to validate the FEA results. The power supply system is ready for fabrication. United States. Department of Energy (award DE-FC 02 - 99 ER 54512...|$|R
40|$|This {{combined}} sedimentological, diagenetic {{and remote}} sensing study of SE Asian Cenozoic carbonate systems {{has implications for}} the understanding of how depositional and diagenetic conditions unique to the equatorial tropics influence regional hydrocarbon reservoir development. Most modern analogues used to help evaluate carbonate development and their subsurface reservoir potential are from sub-tropical to arid regions. However, within carbonate build-ups some of the world’s most prolific hydrocarbon reserves are in Neogene subsurface deposits from SE Asia where the models generated in other regions cannot easily be applied. Modern and Neogene carbonate production is, and was extensive and diverse throughout the tropical waters of SE Asia. Carbonate systems in SE Asia range from mixed carbonate clastic shelves, localised and ephemeral shoals or reefs, a variety of shallow-water platform top settings and deep water and/or reworked carbonates. Despite the economic importance of Neogene carbonate systems as hydrocarbon reservoir targets {{there are very few}} studies of analogous modern or Neogene outcrops from SE Asia. This study evaluates the diagenetic alteration of two Neogene carbonate systems: clastic influenced delta-front patch reefs and an isolated platform from a semi enclosed basin. The third part of the study investigates the environmental characterisation, sedimentology and early alteration of modern fringing reef systems developed around isolated carbonate islands. Comparisons are made with other equatorial carbonate systems and subsurface reservoirs, together with those from other climate belts, thereby enhancing understanding of global carbonate development and hydrocarbon potential. Combined petrographic, geochemical and field studies reveal that mixed carbonate-siliciclastic deposits from humid equatorial coastal settings generally have low reservoir quality, due to the presence of abundant carbonatesiliciclastic matrix and the throughput of undersaturated meteoric fluids that pervasively stabilise and cement the deposits during early burial diagenesis. Also, isolated carbonate platforms that developed in protected and/or subsiding settings may possess low reservoir qualities due to abundant matrix together with extensive burial compaction, stabilisation and cementation. However, in high energy marginal settings it is likely that early marine cementation may be enhanced, with the potential to provide resistance to burial compaction effects and promote higher reservoir quality if primary porosity and pore throats are not totally occluded. The effects of meteoric dissolution in such isolated subsiding platforms is not pronounced and further mitigated by later cementation. Where reef development may have been impacted upon by potential nutrient influx there is less potential for exposure through building to sea level. Over 75 % of the carbonate reservoirs in SE Asia are from isolated pure carbonate platforms. The effects of widespread vadose aragonite dissolution and large-scale reprecipitation of carbonate cements in both the vadose and particularly the phreatic marine realm lead to a layered reservoir development. A combined remote sensing and modern sedimentological study of a small-scale high energy fringing reef system reveals where grainstone textures predominate. The paucity of fines across the system as a whole is attributed to high wave/current energies, the small size of the islands rendering limited <b>protection,</b> <b>bidirectional</b> monsoon winds and the lack of reef rimmed margins built to sea level. Furthermore seagrass beds acting as baffles promote the minor accumulation of fines. It is anticipated that if early partial cementation is promoted in such grainstone deposits good quality reservoir units may be preserved. The satellite and sedimentology study probably only hints at some of the variability within SE Asia’s vast, and virtually unstudied fringing reef systems however, it highlights apparent significant differences between some equatorial fringing reefs and those from the subtropics. The systems studied here reveal the importance of seagrass bed development, the influence of the monsoons and a degree of sediment homogenisation, lack of windward-leeward effects, and a lack of hurricane influence on these equatorial SE Asian fringing reefs...|$|R
