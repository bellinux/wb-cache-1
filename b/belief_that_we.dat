25|$|The deontological {{argument}} against research on human beings is that persons are an ends in themselves. This means we cannot use people for any purpose. The deontological argument {{relies on the}} <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should treat others {{as we would like}} to be treated. If someone was suffering from a terminal illness and they were likely to die shortly, under deontological assumptions research could not be done on them even if it meant saving the lives of millions.|$|E

2500|$|In Althusser's view, our values, desires, and {{preferences}} are inculcated in us by ideological practice, the sphere {{which has the}} defining property of constituting individuals as subjects. Ideological practice consists of an assortment of institutions called [...] "Ideological State Apparatuses" [...] (ISAs), which include the family, the media, religious organisations, and most importantly in capitalist societies, the education system, {{as well as the}} received ideas that they propagate. There is, however, no single ISA that produces in us the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are self-conscious agents. Instead, we derive this belief in the course of learning {{what it is to be}} a daughter, a schoolchild, black, a steelworker, a councillor, and so forth.|$|E

50|$|However, {{it seems}} {{that many of the}} <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> hold have been gained through {{accepting}} testimony. For example, one may only know that Kent is a county of England or that David Beckham earns $30 million per year because one has learned these things from other people. A more striking example is the belief about one's own birthdate. If you know your birthdate, the evidence for your belief was almost certainly received through testimony.|$|R
2500|$|The mood of Arnold's poetry {{tends to}} be of plaintive reflection, and he is {{restrained}} in expressing emotion. He felt that poetry should be the 'criticism of life' and express a philosophy. Arnold's philosophy is that true happiness comes from within, and that people should seek within themselves for good, while being resigned in acceptance of outward things and avoiding the pointless turmoil of the world. However, he argues {{that we should not}} live in the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall one day inherit eternal bliss. If we are not happy on earth, we should moderate our desires rather than live in dreams of something that may never be attained. This philosophy is clearly expressed in such poems as [...] "Dover Beach" [...] and in these lines from [...] "Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse": ...|$|E
2500|$|Convinced by the Black Power {{movement}} to organize white students {{to support the}} civil rights and anti-war movements, Mann moved to Boston in 1968 to become New England Coordinator of SDS. In the spring of 1968, Mann played {{a leadership role in}} the Columbia University student strike led by SDS and the Black Student Union, demanding that Columbia shut down its Institute for Defense Analysis, and that it “integrate” the gymnasium, which only gave Blacks and Puerto Ricans limited access and a separate entrance. As a regional coordinator for SDS, Mann organized and spoke at rallies at Boston University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and other New England colleges. “The Columbia strike more than any other event in our history,” Mann said, “has given the radical student movement the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can change this country.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2015, Hensen and {{co-workers}} {{reported that they}} performed a loophole-free Bell test which might force one to reject {{at least one of}} the principles of locality, realism, or freedom-of-choice (the last [...] "could" [...] lead to alternative superdeterministic theories). Two of these logical possibilities, non-locality and non-realism, correspond to well-developed interpretations of quantum mechanics, and have many supporters; this is not the case for the third logical possibility, non-freedom. Conclusive experimental evidence of the violation of Bell's inequality would drastically reduce the class of acceptable deterministic theories but would not falsify absolute determinism, which was described by Bell himself as [...] "not just inanimate nature running on behind-the-scenes clockwork, but with our behaviour, including our <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are free to choose to do one experiment rather than another, absolutely predetermined". However, Bell himself considered absolute determinism an implausible solution.|$|E

30|$|Two administrators {{expressed}} concerns that clinician implicit biases could interfere with cultural competence. One administrator stated: “We all have attitudes and <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{come into this}} practice with <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have to check {{at the door and}} be very mindful of.” Another gave an example of challenges that she faced as a clinician: “Not bringing in my own judgments, preconceived notions that I may have grown up that I have with my cliques of friends. It is constant learning about who I am and what I’m bringing to the table.” Both clinicians suggested that self-awareness could counteract biases against patients.|$|R
2500|$|They {{employed}} servants, {{including an}} English governess, {{which made it}} possible for Harriet to actively work on the causes important to her. Harriet's elegant English-style house and grounds, called Saint's Rest by abolitionist Sallie Holley, had a calming and restful effect on its visitors. It was where: [...] "the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest." [...] She was often hostess to visiting fellow activists and abolitionists, including William Lloyd Garrison, George Benson, and George Thompson. They had deep and long-term friendships with notable black and white reformers, under the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are all [...] "but one race". Others in the city rallied against blacks and people who aided refugee slaves, which erupted in race riots and violence in the 1830s. In 1834, 44 churches and buildings owned by blacks were set on fire.|$|E
2500|$|The city {{presented}} its bid at Wembley Stadium in November 2009 {{with numerous}} businesses and sports clubs from Devon and Cornwall fully behind it. A selection of those included the city's rugby union and basketball clubs, Plymouth Albion, and Plymouth Raiders, and local football clubs Exeter City, and Torquay United. Plymouth {{was selected as}} a part of England's 2018 FIFA World Cup Bid, alongside 11 other cities on 16 December 2009. Plymouth Argyle director Paul Stapleton described himself as being overwhelmed, going on to say that getting over the first hurdle [...] "gives our supporters <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can achieve things", while the bids chairman, Douglas Fletcher, described the bid as one [...] "for the people of Devon and Cornwall". A day later the club revealed [...] that the stadium could possibly be renamed for sponsorship reasons {{as a part of}} funding for the project which shall begin in the summer of 2010.|$|E

5000|$|She succinctly {{summarizes}} the critics' arguments (for example, anachronistic, selectively imputing current performance ideas on early music), but then concludes {{that what the}} HIP movement has to offer is a different manner of looking at and listening to music: [...] "It keeps our eyes open {{to the possibility of}} producing music in new ways under the regulation of new ideals. It keeps our eyes open to the inherently critical and revisable nature of our regulative concepts. Most importantly, it helps us overcome that deep‐rooted desire to hold the most dangerous of <b>beliefs,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have at any time got our practices absolutely right." ...|$|R

5000|$|According to Janoff-Bulman, {{people come}} up with general {{assumptions}} about the world. These assumptions are undeclared and somewhat implicit, {{and serve as a}} basis of our well-being. They give meaning to our existence. The <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> create come in many forms. They are general ideas about {{the world as a whole}} and reflect its benevolent nature. [...] As Brewin & Holmes state, the five main assumptions are that “the world is benevolent, the world is meaningful, the world is predictable, the assumption of invulnerability, and the self is worthy.“ Therefore, we have high expectations for ourselves, and the world around us, to remain decent and meaningful.|$|R

40|$|Keith DeRose’s {{solution}} to the skeptical problem is based on his indirect sensitivity account. Sensitivity is not {{a necessary condition for}} any kind of knowledge, as direct sensitivity accounts claim, but the insensitivity of our <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> the skeptical hypotheses are false explains why we tend to judge <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do not know them. The orthodox objection line against any kind of sensitivity account of knowledge is to present instances of insensitive <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> still judge to constitute knowledge. This objection line offers counter-examples against the claim of direct sensitivity accounts that sensitivity is necessary for any kind of knowledge. These examples raise an easy problem for indirect sensitivity accounts that claim that there is only a tendency to judge <b>that</b> insensitive <b>beliefs</b> do not constitute knowledge, which still applies to our <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> the skeptical hypotheses are false. However, a careful analysis reveals that some of our <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> the skeptical hypotheses are false are sensitive; nevertheless, <b>we</b> still judge <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do not know them. Therefore, {{the fact that some of}} our <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> the skeptical hypotheses are false are insensitive cannot explain why we tend to judge <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do not know them. Hence, indirect sensitivity accounts cannot fulfill their purpose of explaining our intuitions about skepticism. This is the hard problem for indirect sensitivity account...|$|R
