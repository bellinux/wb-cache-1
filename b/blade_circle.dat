For designing and its subsequent strength control using the finite element method were performed with using static analysis in the program SolidWorks ® 2013. Material of adjustable runner <b>blades</b> <b>circle's</b> parts was designed S 355 J 2 G 3, which is able to withstand a given load. In the design of technology of welding there was elected MAG-welding method, with the active gas mixture Ar + 18 % CO 2. Additive material for welding will be OK Autrod 12. 51, like it‘s marked by ESAB s. r. o.

40|$|The {{prescribed}} {{surface curvature}} distribution <b>blade</b> design (<b>CIRCLE)</b> method {{can be used}} for the design of two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) turbomachinery blade rows with continuous curvature and slope of curvature from leading edge (LE) stagnation point to trailing edge (TE) stagnation point and back to the LE stagnation point. This feature results in smooth surface pressure distributionairfoils with inherently good aerodynamic performance. In this paper the <b>CIRCLE</b> <b>blade</b> de-sign method is modified for the design of 2 D isolated airfoils. As an illustration of the capabilities of the method, it is applied to the redesign of two representative airfoils used in wind tur-bine blades: the Eppler 387 airfoil; and the NREL S 814 airfoil. Computational fluid dynamic analysis is used to investigate the design point and off-design performance of the original and mod-ified airfoils, and compare with experiments on the original ones. The computed aerodynamic advantages of the modified airfoils are discussed. The surface pressure distributions, drag coeffi-cients, and lift-to-drag coefficients of the original and redesigned airfoils are examined. It is concluded that the method {{can be used for}} the design of wind turbine blade geometries of superior aerodynamic performance.

Skaters are judged on the accuracy and {{clarity of the}} figures and the cleanness and exact placement of the various turns on the circles. Figures were formerly included {{as a component of}} singles competitions but were eliminated from international events in 1990. The United States was the last country to retain a separate test and competitive structure for compulsory figures, but the last national-level figures championship was held in 1999. Moves in the field (known in the United Kingdom as field moves) replaced compulsory figures as a discipline to teach the same turns and edge skills.|$|R

He tripped the man, but had to kick hard to {{disengage}} himself from grasping hands. Another figure closed in on Gale. This one was dark, swift. A <b>blade</b> glinted--described a <b>circle</b> aloft. Simultaneously with a close, red flash the knife wavered; the man wielding it stumbled backward. In the din Gale did not hear a report, but the Mexican's fall was significant. Then pandemonium broke loose. The din became a roar. Gale heard shots that sounded like dull spats in the distance. The big lamp behind the bar seemingly split, then sputtered and went out, leaving the room in darkness.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} computational algorithms for the design, analysis, and optimization of airfoil aerodynamic performance. The prescribed surface curvature distribution <b>blade</b> design (<b>CIRCLE)</b> method {{is applied to}} a symmetrical airfoil NACA 0012 and a non-symmetrical airfoil E 387 to remove their surface curvature and slope-of-curvature discontinuities. Computational fluid dynamics analysis is used to investigate the effects of curvature distribution on aerodynamic performance of the original and modified airfoils. An inviscid–viscid interaction scheme is introduced to predict the positions of laminar separation bubbles. The results are compared with experimental data obtained from tests on the original airfoil geometry. The computed aerodynamic advantages of the modified airfoils are analyzed in different operating conditions. The leading edge singularity of NACA 0012 is removed and it is shown that the surface curvature discontinuity affects aerodynamic performance near the stalling angle of attack. The discontinuous slope-of-curvature distribution of E 387 results in a larger laminar separation bubble at lower angles of attack and lower Reynolds numbers. It also affects the inherent performance of the airfoil at higher Reynolds numbers. It is shown that at relatively high angles of attack, a continuous slope-of-curvature distribution reduces the skin friction by suppressing both laminar and turbulent separation, and by delaying laminar-turbulent transition. It is concluded that the surface curvature distribution has significant effects on the boundary layer behavior and consequently an improved curvature distribution will lead to higher aerodynamic efficiency...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe PresCrIbed suRface Curvature {{distribution}} <b>bLade</b> dEsign (<b>CIRCLE)</b> method, {{proposed by}} T Korakianitis, {{is a direct}} method for designing (or redesigning) high efficiency turbomachinery and fan blades, and isolated airfoils. It was initially introduced to improve the design of high efficiency turbomachinery blades. It is now extended for use with 2 D and 3 D turbomachinery blades and isolated airfoils. The connection of the profile's leading edge (LE) to the trailing edge (TE), on both sides, is defined using continuity in the surface curvature and its derivatives. Improvements to the aerodynamic performance of the Eppler airfoil are presented in this paper. Improved geometries with continuous curvature have been produced using the CIRCLE method. The performances of Eppler and the redesigned A 5 and A 6 have been studied using CFD analysis. They are analyzed considering low subsonic flow condition (Reynolds number~ 105). These are compared to a previous airfoil A 4. The redesigned blades’ LE proved favorable as they succeeded in removing pressure ‘spikes’ on the suction side. Comparative analysis with the original results showed significant aerodynamic improvements. Airfoils A 4, A 5 and A 6 have comparatively thicker TE section compared to Eppler. Despite the changes made to the geometry and continuous curvature distribution in A 4, A 5 and A 6 (from Eppler), there appear a separated region on the suction side at about 60 % of the chord downstream from the LE. The new blades exhibit higher aerodynamic efficiencies, in terms of overall lift-to-drag ratio up to 40 % than the original. The investigations are perfo med at on and off design conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{advantages}} of the direct presCrIbed suRface Curvature distribution <b>bLade</b> dEsign (<b>CIRCLE)</b> method for the design of high-efficiency turbomachinery blades. These advantages are illustrated by redesigning several examples of axial turbomachinery blades of interest to energy conversion devices, and discussing in detail the aerodynamic performance and efficiency improvements of the redesigned blades over the original geometries. The two-dimensional (2 D) method, originally proposed for turbine blades, has been extended for use with 2 D and three-dimensional (3 D) turbine, compressor and fan blades, and isolated airfoils. By specification, the method allows joining line segments between the leading edge (LE) and trailing edge (TE) circles or ellipses so that the streamwise distribution of surface curvature and slope of curvature are continuous everywhere from the LE stagnation point to the TE stagnation point. The form of the line segments to prevent the “wiggles” of higher order lines is presented. Also by specification, the CIRCLE method can be integrated with multi-objective heuristic or evolutionary-algorithm optimization methods. The efficacy of the method is examined by: redesigning two 2 D turbine blades, one 2 D compressor blade, and one 2 D isolated airfoil; and by designing one 3 D compressor blade row and one 3 D turbine blade row. The aerodynamic performance improvements between the original and the sample redesigned blades are discussed in detail, resulting in higher-efficiency blades than the original geometries. Further extension of the method for centrifugal and mixed-flow impeller geometries is a coordinate transformation. It is concluded that the CIRCLE method is a new design environment enabling the original design (or redesign) of high-efficiency 2 D and 3 D turbomachine blades, with direct applications in a variety of energy conversion devices. <br/...|$|R
6000|$|For {{some days}} discord raged between the rivals. At last it was settled that I should choose my own Abban in {{presence}} of a general council of the Elders. The chiefs took their places upon the shore, each with his followers forming a distinct semicircle, and all squatting with shield and spear planted upright in the ground. When sent for, I entered the circle sword in hand, and sat down awaiting their pleasure. After much murmuring had subsided, Jami asked in a loud voice, [...] "Who is thy protector?" [...] The reply was, [...] "Burhale Nuh!" [...] Knowing, however, how little laconism is prized by an East-African audience, I did not fail to follow up this answer with an Arabic speech of the dimensions of an average sermon, and then shouldering my <b>blade</b> left the <b>circle</b> abruptly. The effect was success. Our wild friends sat from afternoon till sunset: as we finished supper one of them came in with the glad tidings of a [...] "peace conference." [...] Jami had asked Burhale to swear that he intended no personal offence in taking away a protege pledged to himself: Burhale had sworn, and once more the olive waved over the braves of Berberah.|$|R
