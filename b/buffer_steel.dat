40|$|Immersion {{ultrasonic}} probes for {{measurements and}} imaging at high temperature are presented. The probes consist of sol 2 ̆ 013 gel-sprayed thick films as piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers (UTs) directly deposited onto <b>steel</b> <b>buffer</b> rods. They operate in pulse-echo mode at temperatures up to 5000 C. The operating ultrasonic frequency is between 5 MHz and 20 MHz, {{controlled by the}} film thickness. The ultrasonic thickness measurement of a steel plate with the probe fully immersed in molten zinc at 4500 C was demonstrated using ultrasonic plane waves. For imaging purposes, the probing end of the <b>steel</b> <b>buffer</b> rod was machined into a semispherical concave shape to form an ultrasonic lens and achieve high spatial resolution with focused ultrasound in liquids. Ultrasonic surface and subsurface imaging using a mechanical raster scan of the focused probe in silicone oil at 2000 C was also carried out. The importance of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the pulse-echo measurement is discussed. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|H 13 {{tool steel}} powder was clad on copper alloy {{substrate}} both directly and using 41 C stainless steel (high Ni steel) powder {{as a buffer}} layer by direct metal deposition (DMD). Cu-steel bimetallic die casting and injection molding tools are of high interest for reduction of cycle time by efficient heat extraction due to high thermal conductivity of copper. The mechanical properties of these bimetallic structures were investigated in terms of bond strength, impact energy and fracture toughness. The bond interfaces of these claddings showed porous and crack free transition regions. The bond strength was higher in the directly clad H 13 tool steel compared to the H 13 tool steel clad with 41 C stainless <b>steel</b> as <b>buffer</b> layer. The fracture morphology in tensile test specimens showed ductile dimple fracture. Presence of necking just below the interface depicted the softening of substrate in heat affected zone (HAZ) during cladding. The Charpy impact energy is little higher in the 41 C stainless <b>steel</b> <b>buffered</b> specimens compared to the directly clad H 13 tool steel specimens but the fracture toughness results showed reduction of fracture toughness in the 41 C stainless <b>steel</b> <b>buffered</b> specimens due to the low strength in the tensile test. However the fracture toughness value was in the ductile region for both deposits...|$|R
50|$|On initial completion, {{the first}} {{locomotives}} {{were found to}} weigh 3 LT over the specification weight of 72 LT. A programme of lightening was begun: some of this involved cutting circular lightening holes into the bogie frames, and replacing <b>steel</b> <b>buffer</b> beams or roof panels with aluminium. Much of the over-weight was due to ancillary components, particularly the train-heating steam generators, being supplied over weight. To avoid waste, these components were replaced by lighter versions from other makers, but the heavier originals were then used in the Class 20 and Class 40 locomotives. The lightened locomotives eventually met British Rail's approval, but only after a painstaking weighing that involved specifying the amount of sand in the sandboxes and other precise details.|$|R
50|$|The badik {{consists}} of three parts, namely the handle and blade, {{as well as the}} sheath or scabbard. It comes in a great variety of shapes and sizes. The badik can have a straight, curved, bulbous or wavy, single- or double-edged blade. The blade is smooth or with hollow sections (fullered). The point of the blade can be either pointed or rounded. Like the kris, the shape of the blade is asymmetric and often shows patterns typical of pamor (pattern welding steel commonly known as Damascus steel). However, it differs from the kris in that the badik does not have a ganja (a <b>buffer</b> strip <b>steel).</b> Some versions from Sulawesi are decorated with inlaid gold figure on the blade called jeko. The handle is made of wood, horn or ivory in a shape of a pistol grip at a 45° to 90° angle or similar in a bent shape often decorated with carvings. From its native Sulawesi, the badik soon spread to neighbouring islands like Java, Borneo, Sumatra {{and as far as the}} Malay Peninsula, creating a wide variety of badik according to each region and ethnic group. There are many versions made and used throughout the Indonesian archipelago alone.|$|R
40|$|The {{extraction}} of DNA {{is often the}} most time consuming and laborious step in high-throughput molecular genetic analysis and marker assisted selection (MAS) programs. A simple method for preparation of rice genomic DNA was developed. A small amount (1 - 50 mg) of leaf tissue of rice seedling, 500 μL of extraction <b>buffer,</b> and one <b>steel</b> bead were put into a 2 -mL microcentrifuge tube. After vigorously mashing for 2 min, 5 μL of supernatant was directly applied to PCR amplification. Otherwise, the supernatant was precipitated with two times volume of ethanol to obtain high quality genomic DNA. This method is simple, rapid, low cost, and reliable for PCR analysis. One person can manipulate as many as 96 samples for PCR in 10 min. It is especially suitable for genotyping of large number of samples...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Mathematical {{modeling}} {{of the impact}} of a solid body upon a buffer positioned on a thin isotropic plate, whose dynamic behaviour is described by the Uflyand-Mindlin wave equations taking the rotary inertia and shear deformations into account, is investigated. Two types of the isotropic plate are considered in the present paper: elastic and viscoelastic. The <b>buffer</b> represents a <b>steel</b> screw cylindrical spring and a liquid damper connected with the spring consecutively. Wave equations allow to assume that in a plate the transient wave of transverse shear, because of which there is a deformation of a plate material outside of contact area, is generated with final velocity. As a method of the decision the ray method and method of splicing asymptotic expansion received for small times in a contact area and outside of it are used. ...|$|R

Each of the plates was mm 7. 139 long, mm 2. 76 wide and mm 525. 9 thick (Fig. S 1 b). Homalite- 100 is a brittle polyester resin that exhibits stress-induced birefringence and is mildly rate-sensitive. At the strain rate developed during our experiments (on the order of 13 s 10 −) and at room temperature, Homalite exhibits a purely linear elastic behavior. The pressure, shear and Rayleigh wave speeds of Homalite- 100 are sm 2187 CP =, sm 1249 CS = and sm 1155 CR = respectively. The asymmetric impact loading was imposed via a cylindrical steel projectile of diameter mm 4. 25 and length mm 8. 50, fired using a gas gun. The impact speeds ranged from sm 10 to sm 20.

30|$|B. subtilis BE 1500 biofilms were {{prepared}} as described for MBC experiments. Prior to treatment, biofilms were gently washed three times with 0.85 % NaCl <b>buffer.</b> Each stainless <b>steel</b> coupon with biofilm was placed as the working electrode in the electrochemical cell cuvette shown in Figure 1. Prior to placing the electrode with biofilm in the cuvette, 3 mL LB medium {{was added to}} the cuvette to prevent the biofilm from drying out. Samples were treated for 15 min with 0, 25, 83 and 250 μA/cm 2 DC. Immediately after treatment, the biofilms were placed in a 15 mL polystyrene test tube containing 4 mL 0.85 % NaCl buffer and sonicated for 2 min to remove the biofilm cells from the electrode. The stainless steel electrode was then removed and the tube containing the cells and buffer was vortexed for 30 s to break up any remaining cell clusters. Cell densities after different DC treatments were determined by plating the cultures on LB/agar plates and counting CFUs. The effect of current-generated ions was tested in the same way except that the cells were incubated in pre-treated LB {{in the absence of a}} current.|$|R
40|$|Real-time process {{monitoring}} of the fabrication process of microfluidic devices using a polymer injection molding machine was carried out using miniature ultrasonic probes. A thick piezoelectric lead-zirconate-titanate film as an ultrasonic transducer (UT) was fabricated onto {{one end of a}} 4 -mm diameter and 12 -mm long <b>steel</b> <b>buffer</b> rods using a sol gel spray technique. The center frequency and 6 dB bandwidth of this UT were 17 MHz and 14 MHz, respectively. A signal-to-noise ratio of more than 30 dB for ultrasonic signals reflected at the probing end was achieved. The probe can operate continuously at 20020 C without ultrasonic couplant and cooling. Clear ultrasonic signals were obtained during injection molding of a 1 -mm-thick part having test patterns on its surface. Shrinkage of the molded part and part detachment from the mold were successfully monitored. Surface imperfections of the molded parts {{due to a lack of}} the sufficient holding pressure is discussed with regard to the ultrasonic velocity obtained. The presented ultrasonic probes and technique enable on-line quality control of the molded part by optimizing the holding pressure and improvement of process efficiency by reducing the cycle time.

40|$|Flexible {{ultrasonic}} transducers (UTs) {{consisting of}} a metal foil, a piezoelectric ceramic film and a top electrode have been developed. The flexibility is realized owing to the porosity of piezoelectric film and the thinness of metal foil. In this paper, the stainless steel, lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) /PZT composite and silver paste were chosen as metal foil, piezoelectric film and top electrode materials, respectively. The stainless steel foil serves as both substrate and bottom electrode. The PZT/PZT piezoelectric composite film is made by the sol-gel spray technique. PZT/PZT films of thicknesses from 40 to 70 5 m were fabricated onto SS foils. The capability of these flexible sensors operated in the pulse/echo mode for non-destructive testing on flat and curved surfaces of different materials at room temperature and 1600 C has been demonstrated. Simulations {{of the effects of}} the metal foil thickness on the ultrasonic performance of flexible UTs were also carried out, and the results are in resonable agreement with experimental data. In addition, the PZT/PZT piezoelectric film UTs deposited onto a long <b>steel</b> <b>buffer</b> rod delay line showed a signal strength comparable with that obtained by commercial room temperature narrow bandwidth UTs.

40|$|International audienceThe weak {{interaction}} between zinc and alumina {{is responsible for}} a poor performance of anticorrosive galvanic zinc coatings on modern advanced high strength steels. In this context, we report a theoretical study {{on the effect of}} realistic multicomponent metal buffers on the adhesion strength of a model α-alumina(0001) |zinc interface. Relying on results of ab initio calculations on relevant individual oxide|oxide, oxide|metal, and metal|metal interfaces (separation and interface energies), we determine by Monte Carlo simulations the thermodynamically preferred sequence of components in a multicomponent buffer, as a function of buffer composition and oxygen conditions. We find that stainless <b>steel</b> <b>buffers</b> considerably enhance the overall strength of the alumina|zinc interface. Most importantly, we show that a partial oxidation of multicomponent buffers, which is unavoidable under realistic conditions, does not degrade their performance. This advantageous property relies on the separation of metal and oxide components in the buffer and on the resulting suppression of weakly interacting oxide|zinc and moderately strong alumina|metal interfaces. More generally, owing to the possibility of selective oxidation and component segregation, multicomponent buffers appear as promising solutions for adhesion improvement at weakly interacting metal|oxide interfaces...|$|R

40|$|Thick {{composite}} beams {{are used}} as primary structural members in various engineering applications, for example, composite flex beams in a hinge less rotor system of modern helicopters. One end of the flex beam yoke {{is connected to the}} rotor hub through joints and the other end is connected similarly to the rotor blade. A flex beam yoke has to support rotating loads, vibratory bending loads and torsional loads. It should be strong enough to hold the blade yet flexible enough to allow for the flapping motion. Hence, it is essential to understand the mechanism of stress development, crack initiation and propagation in a bolted thick composite beam, which is subjected to axial and flexural loads. A unidirectional glass/epoxy thick composite beam is considered in this study. A common engineering practice is to use bolted joints to attach two structural members and the bolts are pre-tensed. Buffer pads are attached to the composite beam to avoid localized damage. To simulate the real life situation, a CAD model is generated using ABAQUS 1] consisting of a thick composite beam with eight bolt holes, <b>buffer</b> pads, <b>steel</b> clamping blocks, steel washers and steel bolts. The composite beam is attached to a rigid block using a clamping block, washers and bolts. The finite element mesh is generated using 3 -D continuum elements, C 3 D 8 I. Nonlinear stress analysis is performed for bolt pre-tension and bending loads with material and contact nonlinearity. The numerical results depend on the element type in finite element analysis. Parametric study for element selection between SC 8, C 3 D 8 and C 3 D 20 is carried out. The finite element analysis results are compared with the experimental values. Different failure criteria are considered to study the failure behavior of the thick composite beam: Tsai-Wu, Christensen, and Puck, Hashin and quadratic delamination failure criteria. These failure criteria are coded in ABAQUS through user subroutines. The bolt holes act as stress concentration regions in the beam, where the failure behavior is studied utilizing the above criteria. The effect of different loading, such as bolt pre-tension, bending on the failure of the composite thick beam are investigated...|$|R
