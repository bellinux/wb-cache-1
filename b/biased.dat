This female investment bias may result from the ability of females to become either a worker or a reproductive (this is more adaptive for the nest as it gives the nest increased flexibility compared to that of males and may be important for overall nest success) or because females provide the colony with greater nest defense. Furthermore, even when the original queen is no longer present, the sexual investment is still <b>biased</b> towards females, which is not expected given the genetic implications of a new queen.|$|E

How the <b>biases</b> may interact with one another in anxiety is, however, poorly understood. Using cognitive <b>bias</b> modification techniques, the present study examined whether training a more positive interpretation <b>bias</b> or attention <b>bias</b> resulted in transfer of effects to the untrained cognitive domain. Differences in anxiety reactivity to a real-world stressor were also assessed. Methods. Ninety-seven first year undergraduates who had self-reported anxiety were allocated to one of four groups: attention <b>bias</b> training (n = 24), interpretation <b>bias</b> training (n = 26), control task training (n = 25) and no training (n = 22). Training was computer-based and comprised eight sessions over four weeks. Baseline and follow-up measures of attention and interpretation <b>bias,</b> anxiety and depression were taken. Results: A significant reduction in threat-related attention <b>bias</b> and an increase in positive interpretation <b>bias</b> occurred in the attention <b>bias</b> training group.

Although the test for cluster <b>bias</b> is less powerful, an advantage of the test is that the cause of the <b>bias</b> does not need to be measured, or even known...|$|R
40|$|Avoiding <b>bias</b> is {{essential}} in an observational study on population since <b>bias</b> leads to a misinterpretation {{of the magnitude of}} the effect on a result. Bias is classified into three categories; selection <b>bias,</b> infomation <b>bias</b> and confounding. Selection <b>bias</b> refers to a distortion in the estimate of effect resulting from the manner in which subjects are selected for the study population. Information <b>bias</b> refers to a distortion in the estimate of effect due to measurement error or misclassification of subjects on one or more variables. Confounding is the <b>bias</b> that results when the study factor effect is mixed, in the data, with the effects of extraneous variables. We must maintain the specific characteristics of each of those <b>biases</b> in mind in order to control them. It is not fair to insist that a study result is incorrect because of a small <b>bias</b> since it is impossible to rule out any <b>bias</b> completely when data are collected by observation. Direction of <b>bias</b> is very helpful in judging the study result when some <b>bias</b> is noticed. Neither selection <b>bias</b> nor information <b>bias</b> can be controlled during the data analytic phase. Both selection <b>bias</b> and information <b>bias</b> should be minimized in the reseatch design. Confounding can be controlled in either the research design or the data analytic phase. バイアスは要因と結果の関連の指標の強さを真の値から歪めるものである。集団を対象とした観察研究においては，バイアスは選択バイアス，情報バイアス，交絡に分けられる。選択バイアスは対象の設定の問題から起こるバイアスで，情報バイアスは情報が誤っているために対象を誤分類してしまう問題である。交絡は，原因と結果の双方に関係する他要因によって因果関係が歪められるバイアスである。観察による方法でデータを集める場合には，バイアスを完全になくすことはできないため，バイアスがあるからといってその研究が誤っているという考え方は正しくはない。バイアスをできるだけ少なくする努力は必要であるが，その研究から起こって来る可能性のあるバイアスを考え，そのバイアスが結果を過大評価したのか過小評価したのかを考察し，そのバイアスがあったとしても研究結果を支持できるかどうかを考察することも重要である。また，バイアスを小さくする方法は，選択バイアス，情報バイアス，交絡それぞれについて検討されなければならない。選択バイアスと情報バイアスの対策は研究計画を立てる段階でしかおこなうことはできず，分析の段階で工夫することはできない。一方，交絡は研究計画をおこなう段階でも，分析の段階でも対策を立てることができる...|$|R
