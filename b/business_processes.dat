The results of a study of Germany’s largest 1, 000 business enterprises (response rate 13. 1 %) reveal that <b>business</b> <b>process</b> analysis, <b>business</b> <b>process</b> improvement and the usage of applicant tracking systems reduce recruiting process costs. Specifically, the cycle time of the recruiting process can be shortened significantly through <b>business</b> <b>process</b> controlling and process analysis, and by using an applicant tracking system that supports the design and evaluation of key performance indicators. <b>Business</b> <b>process</b> standardization combined with applicant tracking systems and <b>business</b> <b>process</b> documentation as well these systems used together with <b>business</b> <b>process</b> controlling have a significant positive impact on stakeholder satisfaction with the recruiting process.
