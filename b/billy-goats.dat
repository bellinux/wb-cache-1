40|$|The {{castration}} of most male animals {{seems to}} have been the rule in ancient Greece when rearing cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs; only very few adult males are needed for breeding purposes and flocks of bulls, rams, billy-goats and boars are difficult to keep, since they are too aggressive.  Castrated males yield more and fattier meat, and, in the case of sheep, more wool. Still, sacred laws and sacrificial calendars stipulate the sacrifice of uncastrated victims, and vase-paintings frequently represent bulls, rams and <b>billy-goats</b> in ritual contexts. This paper will discuss the role of uncastrated male animals in Greek cult in the Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic periods, both from a religious and an agricultural perspective.  Of particular interest are the relations between the practical, economic reality and the theological perception of sacrifice. These issues will be explored using epigraphical, literary, iconographical and zooarchaeological evidence...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{determine}} necessary economic and organizational measures for introducing goat insemination in Czech Republic. As the current number of goats is 14 402 head, 23 044 doses are needed for their successful insemination. These doses would be produced from 14 brood <b>billy-goats.</b> Supposing investment costs to establish the insemination station, are estimated at 3 220 000 CZK. The period to repay them would be 4 years and 340 days according to the assumed calculated prices of insemination doses. The distribution and sale of insemination doses would be arranged by breeding organizations under {{an agreement with the}} intended insemination station. The assumed selling price of 1 insemination dose to final customer could be 230, 8 CZK during the 1 st year. The price includes a fee of 100 CZK for the realisation of insemination.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Economia Agrária e Gestão do Território - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{present study}} aims {{to assess the}} {{viability}} of an intensive farm of goat herds. For this was created a standard farm, in intensive system, whose main production is the milk but the product, goat meat, will also be appreciated. Were defined farm’s operating conditions, bearing in mind that a deeper study, or the practice, could come to put in question some of the technical options taken, and make clear the need for change. The goats are permanently closed into a stable, which will require the construction of 1344 square meters of covered area, providing about 1. 5 square meters per animal, and each park will have an equal area outdoors. The facilities also include a milking room with a capacity for 24 simultaneous milking goats in, and a storage capacity of 2110 litres of milk. About the effective, it will be composed of 600 goats and 20 <b>billy-goats</b> of “Murcianogranadina” breed. The productive data, of various breeds, were analyzed, particular five Portuguese breeds and two foreign breeds, but we have chosen “Murciano-granadina” believing {{that this would be}} that would lead to better results. In terms of labour, farm will have 3 full-time employees, although there are times of large peaks of work. Was still defined a standard goat, that will be the mean goat in terms of production and consumption. This goat with about 60 kg bodyweight, which produces 720 litres of milk in 305 days of lactation, being dry 60 days per year, has 80 % of fertility, produces on average 1. 8 kid goats by birth and has interval between births of 1 year. Milk presents a butyric content of 5. 4 % and a protein content of 4. 1 %. Were defined two different diets, always with the food to the description, one to the lactation period and another one, poorer, to the dry period. As for reproductive management, being goats, animals with a very defined reproductive season, were set up to play 3 times, using induction and synchronization of ruts through the placement of implants on goats and also on <b>billy-goats.</b> These periods were defined taking into account the expected developments in the prices of milk and kid goat throughout the year. The initial investment to completion of this farm was analyzed based on enquiries request to companies in their area. Prices have been attributed, to factors of production to use, based on research done on the domestic marke...|$|E

40|$|Simple {{information}} manuals AGRODOKS are {{a series}} of low-priced, simple manuals on agricultural practices in the tropics which are produced by AGROMISA in conjunction with CTA, who finance the translation of the booklets. Agrodok 7, on Goat keeping in the tropics, is designed as a first-aid kit for those who live in isolated places and cannot easily diagnose a disease or have an analysis made of feed quality. The book covers goat breeding; raising and selection; nutrition; housing; health, diseases and parasites; goat products; and administration. A list of helpful literature is included together with useful appendices that deal with units of feed values, an example of how to calculate rations, hoof care, castration of young <b>billy-goats,</b> age estimation, and examples of how to keep a record card on individual goats (male as well as female) and a servicing record. Agrodok 18 deals with Protection of stored grains and pulses; it is a revised edition of the earlier Protection of stored products against insects and fungi. This booklet deals with the problems concerning losses of stored products by storage pests (moulds, insects and rodents), and is meant as a manual for those who are involved with providing information on storage to farmers and cooperatives. Descriptions of the main storage pests are given, together with preventative practices. Special attention is given to the use of natural materials in protecting storage products but there is also information on chemical treatment of stored products against pests. All sections of the books are well illustrated with simple explanatory line drawings. Beekeeping in the tropics (Agrodoc 32), first published in June 1977, was revised for the third time last year. Similarly, The preparation of dairy products, first published in 1985, was also revised last year.
