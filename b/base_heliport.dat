40|$|AbstractHelicopters {{are often}} used for {{transportation}} of workers to and from offshore installations. Flying helicopter is a risky business and is often considered {{as one of the}} main risk factors in this industry. The present paper is dealing with different routing policies for minimizing the expected number of fatalities where the transportation is performed in a hub and spoke fashion from a land <b>based</b> <b>heliport</b> to a set of offshore installations either using the heliport as a hub or using one or more offshore installations as hubs. Some theoretical results are offered as well as an exact model when one operates with more than one offshore hub...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} Master’s Thesis {{is to develop a}} {{learning}} tutorial for Lisboa Quantum GIS v. 1. 8. 0 Geographic Information System. The resulting document is intended as a learning tool. This document should be useful to those people who wish to acquire basic skills in the use of Quantum GIS and, at the same time, should provide the user with a picture of what Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are. The skills that this tutorial aims to teach are how to locate and download useful information to work with GIS, to create vectorial Shape files and work with them, manage, make queries, and select tabulated and graphic information, as well as to represent graphically the results through the creation of maps. The document will make use of real data downloaded from different sources, with the intention of doing the proper operations to simulate a real making-decision process as its leading topic. The subject chosen is related to the optimal location to set air <b>bases</b> (<b>heliports)</b> within Catalonia to fight forest fires in protected areas of Natura Network...|$|R
