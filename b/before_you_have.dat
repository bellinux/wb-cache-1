2500|$|We heard {{something}} was wrong with my dad during the [...] World Cup. He started feeling unwell and then, out of the blue, we were told he only had a few months to live. It was a huge shock because we've always been a very close family. I missed the first couple of Tests in England that year so I could be at home with him. It was obviously the saddest time of my life but those last weeks were maybe some of the most beautiful. It {{gave me a chance to}} say thank you and goodbye. After a while I realised how lucky I was to do that. It's far harder if a parent is taken away <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> that time together. So his death put cricket in perspective for me. It's just a game â€“ and a very simple game if you keep your mind straight.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{praised the}} game's {{ability to play}} updated {{versions}} of the tables previously available for Pinball FX. [...] Andrew Reiner of Game Informer expressed satisfaction with the functionality, indicating that the new social scoring mechanics provided incentive to play the tables again in the new engine. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed noted {{that all of the}} tables from both games are available for demo play. [...] Several reviewers also praised the upgraded physics, feeling that they were lifelike. [...] Richard Basset of TeamXbox noted that the game's graphics were a vast improvement, noting that tables from Pinball FX also received visual upgrades. [...] Table design itself was also given high marks, with Reed calling them [...] "excellent". GameSpot's Justin Calvert noted the wide variety of tables, but expressed frustration regarding the purchasing of new tables. [...] "It's unfortunate that not all of the tables are available to buy individually" [...] stated Calvert, adding [...] "you have to buy {{at least one of the}} four-packs <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the option to play any of the singles." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Let me tell my story, father, {{and then}} <b>you</b> shall judge. <b>Before</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> spoken {{to me at}} all, Marie had given me her troth.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Jodd," [...] I said angrily, [...] "those {{men have}} been in our hands for weeks. How comes it {{that you did not}} {{discover}} these things <b>before?</b> <b>You</b> <b>had</b> my orders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your repentance," [...] I said, [...] "is now superfluous. If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{listened to}} the voice of {{conscience}} and heeded the stings of remorse <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have lived." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fold {{your hands}} before heaven in praying, [...] Lift up your hands into heaven and cry; [...] But look where our dizziest spires are saying [...] What {{the hands of}} a man did up in the sky: [...] Drenched <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> heard the thunder, [...] White <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> felt the snow; [...] For the giants lift up their hands to wonder [...] How high {{the hands of a}} man could go.|$|E
6000|$|Then said Cleever, [...] "I can't understand. Why {{should you}} have seen and done all these things <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> cut your wisdom-teeth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sally," [...] said Mr. Bentley, [...] "you're a wise woman. I believe I've {{made that}} remark <b>before.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> managed that case wonderfully." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} seen it, <b>had</b> <b>you</b> done it," [...] Lute said. [...] "But it was all done <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{a chance to do}} anything. It was not your hand, not even your {{unconscious}} hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before {{they are}} fried," [...] {{finished}} Tom, with a grin. [...] "You see, somebody might lift {{them from the}} henroost <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a chance to cook them," [...] he went on soberly.|$|R
6000|$|... "What a {{long time}} <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to come here again." [...] She ran down the stairs, one hand lightly {{touching}} the broad rail. [...] "It's two months and four days. Summer's gone!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bloomsbury Square is very near. Here {{we are at}} the hotel. Now, father, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{anything}} {{taken off}} the carriages, ask the prices." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No data yet," [...] he answered. [...] "It is {{a capital}} mistake to theorize <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> all the evidence. It biases the judgment." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nay, then, you sit under a sure shadow," [...] {{said the}} youth; [...] "and I suppose you wept {{yourself}} blind when Saint Catherine broke up housekeeping <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> taken arles [Footnote: Anglice-- Earnest-money] in her service?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Ralph, {{you will}} {{understand}} why I would not let <b>you</b> kiss me <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> heard my story. It was because I feared that after hearing it you would not wish to kiss me any more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get your {{revolver}} out, Tom, {{before you}} shoot," [...] Jerry said. [...] "They will be off <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> time to load your rifle again." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You are not thinking, man, {{of attacking}} the jail! That {{would be a}} serious matter. The doors are strong, and <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> the soldiers, to say nought of the town guard and the citizens, upon <b>you</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> reached him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind the}} women! What subject in common could you and Mr. Delamayn {{possibly}} {{have to talk}} about? And why do I see a wrinkle between your eyebrows, now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done with him?--a wrinkle which certainly wasn't there <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> that private conference together?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That {{may be as}} {{the weather}} proves. I warrant me your legs would be a-weary <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{followed}} its bed into the Rocky Mountains; but then there are seasons when it might be done without wetting a foot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! well," [...] he said, [...] "it is a poverty, then, which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> accepted. Tell me, then, of your ambition!
