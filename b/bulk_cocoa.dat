40|$|A problem {{encountered}} in plant breeding process to determine bean color quality of fine-flavor cocoa {{is a long}} selection period. Preliminary results indicatedthat the fine-flavor cocoa has a low color reflectance than <b>bulk</b> <b>cocoa.</b> The objectiveof {{this study is to}} find more applicable and easier method to do the early detectionof fine-flavor cocoa on the breeding population. Detection of the leaf color haracteristics was done by chromatographic and spectrophotometry analysis. hromatographic analysis was carried out in Kaliwining Experimental Station, IndonesianCoffee and Cocoa Research Institute using complete random design consistedof two types of cocoa; fine-flavor (10 clones) and <b>bulk</b> <b>cocoa</b> (10 clones). pectrophotometric analysis was conducted at Ma Chung University, Malang, East Java. Four clones of <b>bulk</b> <b>cocoa</b> and six clones of fine flavor cocoa were used in thisanalysis. The results of the study showed that the flush color characteristics of thefine-flavor cocoa were different from the <b>bulk</b> <b>cocoa</b> characteristics as shown bythe differences in the value of L*, b* and anthocyanin content. Flush characteristic s ofthe fine-flavor cocoa had brighter color, more toward green with higher yellowlevel, while the <b>bulk</b> <b>cocoa</b> had darker flush, red and lower yellow level. Thecolor parameter of L* and b* had a higher genetic variation compared with theenvironment variation. However, the parameter a* had a higher environmental variation compared with genetic variation. Grouping of fine-flavor cocoa and bulk cocoacould be done through the detection of flush anthocyanin content, when tendencyof flush anthocyanin content on fine-flavor cocoa was lower than <b>bulk</b> <b>cocoa.</b> The detection of flush color particularly L* and b* parameters through hromatographic analysis and anthocyanin content through spectrophotometric analysismay be used as a criteria for selection the fine flavor cocoa on seedling phase...|$|E
40|$|Yielding and its {{adaptability}} {{are considered}} to be an important criteria for clones recommendation. An experiment to evaluate yield and its adaptability of several promising <b>bulk</b> <b>cocoa</b> clones has been executed during 1996 — 2003 in three locations having different altitude and type of climate, consisted of Jatirono (450 m asl., B type of climate), Kalisepanjang (275 m asl., C type of climate) and Kalitelepak (145 m asl., B type of climate). Randomized completely block design (RCBD) was used in each location with 14 promising clones and four replications. Recommended clones of ICS 60 and GC 7 were used as standard. The promising clones were originated from mother trees selection with the main criteria of yield. Observations were conducted on yield and its components as well as bean characteristics. Determination of adaptability of each clone by using yield performance and its stability. Statistical analysis was done by using combined analysis. The results showed that KW 30 and KW 48 perform higher yield (2. 3 ton/ha) than that of standard clone (1. 7 ton/ha) as well as consistant yield stability between location and over years. There for, the two clones performed good adaptability. KW 30 and KW 48 also perform good yield components, and high percentage of fat content i. e 55 %. So, those clones are potential to be recommended for commercial planting materials. Key words : <b>bulk</b> <b>cocoa,</b> yield, clone, stability, adaptability. </p...|$|E
40|$|Ghana is well {{endowed with}} premium <b>bulk</b> <b>cocoa</b> and is {{strategically}} positioned to capture significant market shares {{for the growing}} demand in specialty cocoa products on the world market. Consumers’ taste and preference for differentiated or ‘specialty’ cocoa based on environmental- and ethically certified cocoa products have been rising over the years. This study uses an ex-ante analytical approach to explore the potential for smallholder cocoa farmers in Ghana to develop niche markets for an environmentally and sustainably produced cocoa, namely; Rainforest Alliance Certified cocoa {{as an alternative to}} Ghanaian <b>bulk</b> <b>cocoa.</b> Using NPV, BCR and IRR economic decision criteria, the profitability or otherwise of introducing this rainforest alliance certified cocoa in Ghana is assessed. Rainforest Alliance certification requires farmers to shift from low or no shade Amazon production systems (i. e., < 20 trees per ha) to medium shade Amazon production systems (70 shade trees distributed over a minimum of 12 species per ha) as well as other standards. In the base case scenario, results of the hypothetical high certified production system are compared with the current low input landrace cocoa and high input no shade cocoa systems. Under these conditions the certified production system and the low input landrace cocoa are essentially breakeven propositions while the high technology full sun system was moderately profitable. Sensitivity analysis of changes in FOB shares revealed that increasing the percentage of producer price from 70 to 85 percent of FOB dramatically increases the profitability of Rainforest Alliance certified cocoa at all varying FOB price levels when fertilizer price is subsidized. Profitability did however not change from the base model when fertilizer subsidies are removed by the government and the producer price increases to 85 percent of FOB.

40|$|Cocoa plant {{generally}} {{is classified as}} cross pollinated plant and self-incompatible plant, then there is indication the presence of pollen influence on cocoa bean quality. This study was aimed {{to determine the effect}} of pollen sources (xenia) on the colour and size characters of fresh cocoa beans (Theobroma cacao L.). This study was done on two stages. The first stage, a treatment of hand pollination of cocoa clones of DR 1, DR 2, DRC 16, KW 264 and ICCRI 03 was applied in this study. There were five treatments of hand pollination: DR 2 x DR 1, DRC 16 x DR 1, DRC 16 X KW 264, DR 1 x DR 2 and ICCRI 03 x DRC 16. Each treatment was repeated four times. Colour parameters of fresh cocoa beans were observed. The second stage consisted of nine hand pollination combinations: TSH 858 x Sulawesi 1, TSH 858 x ICCRI 03, TSH 858 x KW 264, TSH 858 x KW 570, TSH 858 x Sca 6, Sulawesi 1 x TSH 858, Sulawesi 1 x Sca 6, Sulawesi 1 x KW 570 and KW 516 x Sca 6. Each treatment was repeated three times. Size parameters of fresh cocoa pod and beans were observed. The result showed that hybridization using pollen source from <b>bulk</b> <b>cocoa</b> and DR 1 contributed dark colour to fineflavored cocoa. This colour contribution was showed by the increase in the dark fresh percentage of cocoa beans. On the other hand, hybridization using pollen source from fine-flavored cocoa contributed white and pale colour to <b>bulk</b> <b>cocoa.</b> This light colour contribution was showed by the decrease in the percentage of the dark fresh beans. Xenia effect occured on pod weight, pod length, pod girth, bean weight with pulp per pod and bean weight without pulp per pod which was shown by the hybridization with TSH 858 as female parent and weight bean without pulp per pod shown by the hybridization with THS 858 and Sulawesi 1 as female parent...|$|E
40|$|In general, {{the classic}} {{problems}} faced by the cocoa farmer are low productivity and quality of cocoa beans as farmers do not perform fermentation due to a longer processing time. <b>Bulk</b> <b>cocoa</b> beans covered with pulp presumably affecting the fermentation time and bean quality. The research objective was to assess a combination of bioprocessing technology and mechanized-depulping {{to improve the quality}} of fermented cocoa beans. The study was conducted from July 2011 to July 2012 on cocoa farmer groups in Pacitan Regency, East Java, using engine depulper (500 kg/hour capacity) and manually (20 kg/ 10 minutes or about 120 kg/hour capacity). The results showed that fermentation time was shorter in squeezed pulp, either using engine depulper or manually. Both the temperature and pH of fermented beans reached its highest point on the fourth day and decreased on day five, from which obtained higher quality beans indicated by clean and bright brown color with better flavour and color as well as lower acidity, astringent, and smell...|$|E
40|$|The {{fatty acids}} from cocoa butters of {{different}} origins, varieties, and suppliers {{and a number}} of cocoa butter equivalents (Illexao 30 - 61, Illexao 30 - 71, Illexao 30 - 96, Choclin, Coberine, Chocosine-Illipe, Chocosine-Shea, Shokao, Akomax, Akonord, and Ertina) were investigated by bulk stable carbon isotope analysis and compound specific isotope analysis. The interpretation is based on principal component analysis combining the fatty acid concentrations and the bulk and molecular isotopic data. The scatterplot of the two first principal components allowed detection of the addition of vegetable fats to cocoa butters. Enrichment in heavy carbon isotope (C- 13) of the <b>bulk</b> <b>cocoa</b> butter and of the individual fatty acids is related to mixing with other vegetable fats and possibly to thermally or oxidatively induced degradation during processing (e. g., drying and roasting of the cocoa beans or deodorization of the pressed fat) or storage. The feasibility of the analytical approach for authenticity assessment is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the research presented in this thesis were: (1) optimise the processing conditions {{for the production of}} water-in-cocoa butter emulsions; (2) understand the role of water droplets on the large deformation behaviour and crystallisation properties of emulsified systems. Results showed that a scraped surface heat exchanger could be used to produce tempered emulsions with a small average droplet size (3 µm). In all systems stability was provided by the emulsifier and fat crystals forming a network both in the bulk and at the interface of the water droplets. Characterisation of the large deformation properties of emulsions showed that the elastic behaviour remained constant at low aqueous phase percentages while the strength at fracture decreased. This result suggests that water droplets act as stress-concentrator elements, which is probably due to their partial sintering with the bulk network. Results of crystallisation experiments have shown that the effect of droplets on kinetics of crystallisation depends on the degree of supercooling: only at relatively high temperatures (15, 20 °C) the dispersed droplets increased the kinetics of crystallisation compared to <b>bulk</b> <b>cocoa</b> butter (CB). With respect to polymorphic evolution, emulsified systems evolved faster toward more stable forms than bulk CB at all temperatures...|$|E
40|$|One of {{important}} steps in secondarycocoa process is deshelling cocoa beans roasted. The aim of deshelling is to enrich cotyledon cocoa surface area which affects to reduce energy and processing time with good {{quality of the}} chocolate product. The objective {{of this research is}} to study the influence of milling process on physical characteristic change of cocoa beans roasted such as size distribution change, geometrical diameter average, uniformity index, fineness modulus, and average dimension of cotyledoncocoa roasted. The Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute has designed and tested deshelling of roasted cocoa beans which will be used in this research. Before deshelling process, C grade <b>bulk</b> <b>cocoa</b> beans has been roasted up to 2. 5 — 3 % water contents. The result showed that optimal milling process by rotary cutter type milling unit has good size distribution change, geometrical diameter average, uniformity index, fineness modulus, and average dimension on 500 rpm rotary speed and 2. 8 m/s air flow. On optimal process condition, 74. 5 % of cocoa cotyledon roasted has diameter size between 2. 0 — 4. 75 mm, 2. 116 mm average of geometrical diameter, 0. 864 mm average dimension, 3. 052 fineness modulus, and 80 % as crude size particel- 20 % as temperate size particel on uniformity index. Therefore, more than 80 % of cocoa cotyledon roasted has diameter size between 2. 0 — 4. 75 mm with 700 — 900 rpm rotary cutter speed. Average of geometric diameter was 1. 65 — 2. 19 mm, and the dimension average was 0. 69 — 0. 89 mm. Uniformity index was crude size particle up to 80 — 90 %, and in temperate size particle 10 — 20 %. Fineness modulus value was 2. 73 — 3. 09. Key words: cocoa, milling, size distribution, roasted beans...|$|E
40|$|The cocoa {{plant has}} {{travelled}} far and wide. After being cultivated for several centuries by the Mayan Indians in central America, {{it was introduced}} to Trinidad in 1525, and continued its voyage, as it were, against the trade winds. It was introduced to Sao Tomé in 1830, and to Ghana in 1879. It carried on further, setting up home in Cameroon, Nigeria and Côte d'Ivoire in particular. In all, more than 15 million people in ACP countries are now directly involved in cocoa cultivation. The early popularity of cocoa as a crop {{stems from the fact}} that anyone endowed with muscles and patience could start a plantation by partially clearing a few hectares of virgin forest and introducing some young plants. The first harvest comes after several years. It is only after thirty years that problems arise, or earlier if a plantation has not been properly maintained. On worn-out soils, pests and disease attack aged plants, and yields fall. Ageing cocoa plants are a serious problem in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana; between them, they account for more than half the world's output, and a gradual reduction in rainfall since 1950 has encouraged attacks by mirids which cause young cocoa pods to wither. A new calamity in the long list of 'black pod' diseases is Phytophthora megakarya, a particularly nasty fungus which has led to production losses of 50 % to 80 % in Cameroon and Nigeria; Ghana has been affected since 1998, and Côte d'Ivoire is expected to be hit soon. No choice but to rehabilitate? These problems have to dealt with head-on: they cannot be solved by leaving behind old plantations, preparing new virgin areas and planting seedlings; gaining access to new land is much too difficult. This means rehabilitation to ensure that of production does not require any more time nor additional space: regenerating with improved varieties which are more productive and disease-resistant, better husbandry, pesticides and regular care 1. Many farmers cannot afford the expenses involved in intensifying production like this. They have to negotiate on their own with traders who keep 'farm-gate' prices for cocoa pods down to a minimum. Where once there used to be governmental support for producer cooperatives now there is none, for these are the days and the ways of the disengaging State. Furthermore, market regulatory bodies (such as the Stabilisation Board in Côte d'Ivoire or the Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board) have been blown away by the winds of liberalisation. With their disappearance, many hopes have faded of being able to manipulate world markets ? by withholding part of the harvest from the market in order to force prices up, for example. The world market price for cocoa has stayed relatively stable, with only very gradual increases. Caught in a cleft stick like this, how can cocoa producers develop a sustainable model of production? Quality: fine, fair and organic options Some promising solutions are at hand. The road that leads from the cocoa pod to the chocolate bar is a long one, but the paths and interests of producers, traders, processors and consumers can sometimes converge. The market for <b>bulk</b> <b>cocoa</b> ? a commodity heavily used throughout the confectionery industry ? represents 95 % of the total market, and it is here that the major industrial processors are increasingly concerned about the lower standards of quality resulting from reduced State supervision and control. The processors are sorely tempted to take over the entire 'cocoa chain': building new factories in producer countries, buying direct from the producers, and assisting them with replanting programmes. All this would be good for their image, and their interests, and, indeed, not entirely bad for the producers. Other opportunities exist, no doubt more interesting in nature but more limited in scope, in more segmented slices of the market. The quality market for so-called 'fine chocolate' is an example, but the varieties which produce this are weak and low-yielding and are mainly grown on certain soils in Belize, Togo and Madagascar, for example. Another market is for cocoa with an 'organic' label, grown with the greatest respect for the environment. Yet another is for so-called Fair Trade cocoa (see Viewpoint, page 16), which guarantees consumers that the producer has been paid a decent enough price to keep on producing. 'Fine' chocolates, 'organic' and 'fair' cocoa products ? or, better still, all three together ? can command a premium price which some Western consumers are prepared to pay. If producers are to conquer this market, they will need to organise themselves to provide the necessary finance and techniques for improving production and guaranteeing quality. Once organised on a broader front, they will have access to support services and will have a strong negotiating position. Of all the links in the cocoa chain, this is probably the one to watch in years to come. More information: Cocoa, Tropical Agriculturalist series G Mossu.
