5|$|Carte's London {{house was}} at the Adelphi, {{not far from the}} Savoy. Passionate about the visual arts as well as the {{performing}} arts, Carte invited his friend, the artist James McNeill Whistler, to decorate the house. Whistler had the entire billiard room painted the colour of the <b>billiard</b> <b>cloth,</b> and elsewhere painted his favourite yellow with his own hand. Equally enthusiastic for technological innovation, Carte installed a lift, the first in a private house in England. Around 1890, he bought a small island in the River Thames, between Weybridge and Shepperton, called Folly Eyot, which he renamed D'Oyly Carte Island. He wanted to use the island as an annex to his new Savoy Hotel, but the local authorities refused to grant him a drinks licence for the property. Instead, he built Eyot House, a large house and garden on the island, that he used as a residence. In later years, Carte displayed his macabre sense of humour by keeping a crocodile on the island.|$|E

500|$|Cloth {{has been}} used to cover billiards tables since the 15th century. The {{predecessor}} company of the most famous maker of <b>billiard</b> <b>cloth,</b> Iwan Simonis, was formed in 1453.

60|$|Mr. Dougherty had {{intended}} to make the outing with his unwonted wife an inconspicuous one. Uxoriousness was a weakness that the precepts of the Caribs did not countenance. If any of his friends of the track, the <b>billiard</b> <b>cloth</b> or the square circle had wives they had never complained of the fact in public. There {{were a number of}} table d'hôte places on the cross streets near the broad and shining way; and to one of these he had purposed to escort her, so that the bushel might not be removed from the light of his domesticity.|$|E
60|$|One sizzling August {{afternoon}} the commissioner reclined {{in his office}} chair, with his feet upon the long, official table covered with green <b>billiard</b> <b>cloth.</b> The commissioner was smoking a cigar, and dreamily regarding the quivering landscape framed by the window that looked upon the treeless capitol grounds. Perhaps {{he was thinking of}} the rough and ready life he had led, of the old days of breathless adventure and movement, of the comrades who now trod other paths or had ceased to tread any, of the changes civilization and peace had brought, and, maybe, complacently, of the snug and comfortable camp pitched for him under the dome of the capitol of the state that had not forgotten his services.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Billiard</b> <b>cloth</b> (sometimes erroneously called felt) is a {{specific}} type of cloth that covers the top of the table's [...] "playing area". Both the rails and slate beds are covered with 21-24 ounce <b>billiard</b> <b>cloth</b> (although some less expensive 19oz cloths are available) which is most often green in color (representing the grass of the original lawn games that billiards evolved from), and consists of either a woven wool or wool/nylon blend called baize.|$|E
5000|$|All {{types of}} tables {{are covered with}} <b>billiard</b> <b>cloth</b> (often called [...] "felt", but {{actually}} a woven wool or wool/nylon blend called baize). Cloth {{has been used to}} cover billiards tables since the 15th century.|$|E
5000|$|Other rules {{may vary}} from locale to locale (even {{to the point}} of {{introducing}} new fouls: some table owners ban, and punish with a 1-point penalty, any jump or [...] shots due to &#91;not necessarily reasonable&#93; fear of damage to the <b>billiard</b> <b>cloth</b> by enthusiastic but insufficiently skilled players).|$|E

50|$|The tournament {{was first}} held in 1992, {{and was a}} ranking tournament. It was {{sponsored}} by <b>billiard</b> <b>cloth</b> company Strachan. The event was boycotted by several top players due to lower points tariff and prize money. The final stages were played at the Thornbury Leisure Centre in Thornbury. Peter Ebdon made his first official maximum break in the qualifying rounds against Wayne Martin.|$|E

5000|$|On 29 December 1985, {{the inaugural}} meeting {{was held at}} the hotel [...] "Goldener Kopf" [...] (engl.: [...] "Golden Head") in Bad Säckingen near the German Swiss border. Fifteen people came to the {{establishing}} assembly. They decided that the seat of the BWA would be Geneva in order to be close to the UMB and the IOC Supporters included, among others, Georg Peltzer, senior director and descendant of Henry Simon Simonis, founder of Simonis <b>Billiard</b> <b>cloth</b> factory in 1680, [...] and Reinhold Würth, senior partner of the Würth Group.|$|E
50|$|Cue tip chalk (invented in {{its modern}} form by {{straight}} rail billiard pro William A. Spinks and chemist William Hoskins in 1897) {{is made by}} crushing silica and the abrasive substance corundum or aloxite (aluminium oxide), into a powder. It is combined with dye (originally and most commonly green or blue-green, like traditional <b>billiard</b> <b>cloth,</b> but available today, like the cloth, in many colors) and a binder (glue). Each manufacturer's brand has different qualities, which can significantly affect play. High humidity can also impair the effectiveness of chalk. Harder, drier compounds are generally considered superior by most players.|$|E
