40|$|In {{an earlier}} study (1), we found {{evidence}} that exposure to electric blankets or heated waterbeds near the time of conception may sometimes lead to early fetal loss. From those data, we could not tell whether this effect should be attributed to excessive <b>bed</b> <b>heating</b> or to the electromagnetic fields pro-duced by the electric bed heaters. To sepa-rate the effects of bed-heating from effects that {{may be due to}} electromagnetic field exposure, we have here studied fetal loss in Oregon families living in homes with, or without, ceiling cable electric heat. Our measurements and calculations show that ceiling cable heat exposes room occupants to a magnetic field of about 10 milligauss, and an electric field in the range of 10 - 50 volts/meter when the heat is turned on. Ambient fields in most homes, including those with the more common baseboard electric heat, are otherwise less than one milligauss and about 10 volts/ meter (2). Our work on electrically heated beds has suggested that 60 Hz electromagnetic field exposures may affect human fetal develop-ment directly, or through an effect on the mother (1); and the work of Nordstrom et al.

40|$|Previous work at Warwick has {{established}} that heat transfer within an active carbon adsorbent bed {{can be improved}} dramatically {{by the use of}} a monolithic carbon—aluminium laminate. Experimental results are presented which illustrate the excellent effective conductivity. However, the system tested did not achieve its full potential due to heat transfer problems external to the <b>bed.</b> <b>Heating</b> is achieved by condensing steam on the generators at up to 140 °C and cooling by boiling water down to 40 °C. This should have achieved rapid heating and cooling but two problems were encountered. Firstly, the complete system was physically complex with many valves, joints etc. and it proved difficult to prevent air leaking in to the sub-atmospheric section where it degraded the cooling performance. Secondly, the thermal mass of the shell and flanges surrounding the generators (needed to contain steam at 10 bar) presented an unacceptably high thermal load that had to be taken through the full temperature swing of each cycle. The external heating and cooling system is being completely redesigned to eliminate these problems. Rather than using the same working fluid to both heat and cool the generators, two separate thermosyphon heat pipe fluids are used in heating and cooling. This reduces the number of switching valves from ten vacuum-sealed ball valves costing £ 200 each to four solenoid valves costing £ 5 each. The massive flanges are no longer needed, since the thermosyphon heat pipes are simple tubes. Water will be used in the heating thermosyphons and pentane in the cooling thermosyphons...|$|E
40|$|Phase {{change in}} a cloud of {{droplets}} and beds of particles heated by convection and radiation arises in numerous important technological and materials processing applications. Examples involving evaporation of sprays include fuel droplets combustion devices, fire control using water sprays, irrigation of crops, etc. In materials processing beds of particles (i. e., sand, recycled aluminum, etc.) are melted in furnaces to produce engineered materials. When the heat sources are at high temperature, radiation transfer has to be accounted for in analysis. In this research, phase change of a single particle is considered first to develop understanding of the fundamental heat transfer/phase change processes before tackling melting of a particle <b>bed</b> <b>heating</b> by convection and radiation from above. ^ Evaporation of a droplet (fuel and water) heated by convection and external radiation field is analyzed as examples of application in fuel spray combustion and fire control. The droplets are assumed to be spherical and semitransparent to radiation. Published spectral absorption coefficient data are used in the calculations, and model predictions are compared with available experimental and theoretical results on water, n-heptane and n-decane evaporation. ^ Melting of spherical opaque and semitransparent particles is analyzed, and a thermal model is developed. As an example, fused silica is considered as the material and spectral absorption coefficient data from the literature are used to predict the local spectral irradiance and the local volumetric rate of absorption and emission of radiation as a function of particle diameter and the external radiation source temperature.

40|$|The study {{focuses on}} the {{construction}} of a normative deprivation index for Bangladesh, which in the traditions of Townsend (1979), Mack and Lansley (1985, 1992), Halleröd (1994) and Gordon et al. (2000), underscores items the lack of which would constitute poverty. However, unlike these studies, the present study does not measure the head count ratio but explores the dynamics of this normative construction of deprivation in terms of demographic and socio-economic variables. The data for this study come from a sample survey of 1, 914 respondents, 1, 207 males and 707 females, from all over Bangladesh in 2000. The normative deprivation index for Bangladesh in 2000 shows that 17 items out of 69 appear significant at the level of α=. 01 in inter-item total correlation and more than 50 percent of respondents perceive their absence as constituting poverty. More than 70 percent respondents agree on the importance of 7 items: (i) three meals a day for children, (ii) two meals a day for adults, (iii) quilt for every member of the household; (iv) milk for babies, (v) celebration of religious festivals, (vi) pillow for every member of the household, and (vii) one pair of all-weather shoes. The British society during 1960 s was more concerned with cooked breakfast, children’s birthday party and a week’s holiday, whereas during 1980 s and 1990 s, it was more preoccupied with heating, toilet, bath, beds and damp free home. However, during late 1990 s, there was a shift of trend towards hospital visit and two meals a day. The Swedish society had more medical priorities than others and viewed glasses, vacuum cleaner and telephone as more necessary than <b>bed,</b> <b>heating,</b> toilet and bath as perceived by the British.

40|$|ABSTRACT- Fluidized <b>bed</b> <b>Heat</b> {{exchangers}} {{are important}} inmany industrial applications. Understanding how a fluidized bed as a multiphase flow system operates will improve its capabilities and operations. Minimum fluidization velocity and local gas holdup are important parameters used {{to characterize the}} hydrodynamic behavior of a material inside the fluidized bed. Fluidization is the phenomenon of imparting the properties of a fluid to a bed of particulate solids by passing atmospheric air through the material. Fluidized beds are reactors in which fluidization of particulate solids takes place. Fluidized beds are an important asset in many industrial processes because they present several advantages that include {{a high rate of}} heat and mass transfer, low pressure drops, and uniform temperature distribution. Experiments have been carried out in a setup i. e. in a fluidized <b>bed</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger, to find out the Heat transfer coefficient between different silica sand particles and in different velocities of air. The whole sand <b>bed</b> is <b>heated</b> by cartage heater. An experiment is performed with three different sand particles with different diameter and ten different gas velocities. The bed particles are chosen by taking Geldart’s criteria. Silica sand particles are of diameter 300 - 450 μm, 425 - 650 μm and 600 - 850 μm. Fluidization is carried out by using air having normal temperature.

40|$|Ozon layer {{depletion}} {{and global}} warming by synthetic refrigerants forces refrigeration industries to switch over to natural but hazardous refrigerants like ammonia and hydrocarbons. A promising technology to safely use the latter refrigerants is the application of indirect refrigeration systems with ice slurry as heat transfer fluid. Ice slurry, a suspension of aqueous solution and small ice crystals, has a high volumetric heat capacity, which enables to apply thermal storage and to reduce primary energy consumption. Its main disadvantage is the tendency of ice crystals to adhere to heat exchanger walls during crystallization, also known as scaling or fouling. This thesis demonstrates that liquid-solid fluidized <b>bed</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers are able to prevent this type of fouling. Experimental results show that fouling prevention is achieved when the removal rate induced by the fluidized bed exceeds {{the growth rate of}} ice crystals on the wall. The removal rate appears to be proportional with the impulse exerted by fluidized particles on the wall, while the ice growth rate depends strongly on the temperature difference and the solute type and concentration.
