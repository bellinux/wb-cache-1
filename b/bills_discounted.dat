30|$|In cases, {{where the}} home user has to {{configure}} the initial setup phase, he/she can assign priorities to specific UEs, which frequently utilize the femtocell for acquiring access to mobile services [e.g., the home user can define his/her CSG {{and determine the}} context in which a nearby macro UE can connect to the femtocell without degrading the quality of experience (QoE) of CSG’s users]. Another priority assignment procedure can take place for different service classes (e.g., the home user can define which type of services will have the highest priority and thus no QoS degradation is acceptable even in high backhaul capacity utilization situations). Given the fact that a mentality shift occurs in cellular operators’ industry towards giving several motivations to femtocell owners in order their FAPs to serve more macro UEs and thus offload mobile traffic from cellular operators’ infrastructure, the initial setup phase can become very important for the femtocell owner to experience considerable <b>bill</b> <b>discounts.</b>|$|R

The business had been founded in 1800 by Thomas Richardson, clerk to a London bill discounter, and John Overend, chief clerk in the bank of Smith, Payne & Company in Nottingham, with the Gurneys supplying the capital. At that time <b>bill</b> <b>discounting</b> was carried on sporadically by ordinary merchants in addition to their regular business, but Richardson considered that there was room for a London house that would itself entirely to trading in bills. This novel idea proved an instant success. On his father's death in 1809, Samuel Gurney assumed the control of the Norwich bank. At the same time he took control of Richardson and Overend, whose name was subsequently changed to Overend, Gurney and Company. Very soon after Gurney entered the firm, it began to assume gigantic proportions. It was for about forty years the largest discounting house in the world. At first only <b>discounting</b> <b>bills,</b> it soon came to lending money on all sorts of securities. In the panic of 1825, the firm was able to lend money to many houses to tide them over their difficulties; this brought them into even greater favour. Gurney became known as [...] "the bankers' banker", and many firms which had previously dealt with the Bank of England now began depositing their surplus cash in its hands. At the time of Gurney's death in 1856, it was calculated that the house held deposits amounting to £8 million sterling. (However, the bank collapsed in 1866, owing millions.) ...|$|R
