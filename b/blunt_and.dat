5|$|In 2010, Whitlock et al. {{described}} a juvenile skull {{at the time}} referred to Diplodocus (CM11255) that differed greatly from adult skulls of the same genus: its snout was not <b>blunt,</b> <b>and</b> the teeth were {{not confined to the}} front of the snout. These differences suggest that adults and juveniles were feeding differently. Such an ecological difference between adults and juveniles had not been previously observed in sauropodomorphs.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle toe}} of the California condor's foot is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only {{slightly}} developed. The talons of all the toes are straight and <b>blunt,</b> <b>and</b> are thus more adapted to walking than gripping. This is more similar to their supposed relatives the storks than to birds of prey and Old World vultures, which use their feet as weapons or organs of prehension.|$|E

Streep played along with a stern expression before smiling.|$|E
5|$|House {{was created}} by David Shore, who {{got the idea for}} the misanthropic title {{character}} from a doctor's visit. Initially, producer Bryan Singer wanted an American to play House, but British actor Hugh Laurie's audition convinced him that a foreign actor could play the role. Shore wrote House as a character with parallels to Sherlock Holmes—both are drug users, <b>blunt,</b> <b>and</b> close to being friendless. The show's producers wanted House handicapped in some way and gave the character a damaged leg arising from an improper diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|The {{bramble shark}} has a thick, {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} somewhat flattened head. The snout is <b>blunt</b> <b>and</b> shorter than {{the width of the}} mouth, with widely spaced nostrils that are preceded by small flaps of skin. The eyes lack nictitating membranes; the tiny spiracles are located well behind them. The wide, curved mouth bears very short furrows at the corners. There are 20–26 upper and 22–26 lower tooth rows; each tooth is knife-like, with a single main cusp and up to three cusplets on either side. There are five pairs of gill slits, with the fifth pair the longest.|$|E
5|$|The {{head has}} {{a less than}} {{triangular}} shape with a <b>blunt</b> <b>and</b> rounded snout. Still, the head is much wider than the neck. The rostral scale is small. The circumorbital ring consists of 10–16 scales. Across {{the top of the}} head, there are 7–11 interocular scales. 3–4 scales separate the suboculars and the supralabials. There are 12–17 supralabials and 13–17 sublabials. The first 3–4 sublabials contact the chin shields, of which there is only one pair. Often, there are two fangs on each maxilla and both can be functional.|$|E
5|$|The twigs of the {{red maple}} are reddish in color and {{somewhat}} shiny with small lenticels. Dwarf shoots are present on many branches. The buds are usually <b>blunt</b> <b>and</b> greenish to reddish in color, generally with several loose scales. The lateral buds are slightly stalked, and in addition there may be collateral buds present as well. The buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their reddish tint. The leaf scars on the twig are V-shaped and contain 3 bundle scars.|$|E

5|$|Viewed in deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, {{the spores}} of Marasmius rotula appear white or pale yellow. Under an optical microscope, they are hyaline (translucent), teardrop- or pip-shaped, and have {{dimensions}} of 7–10 by 3–5µm. The basidia (spore-producing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped or nearly so, and 21–21 by 4–17µm. Along {{the edge of the}} gill, interspersed among the basidia, are non-reproductive cells, the cheilocystidia; these are club-shaped with rough wart-like protuberances on the surface. The gill edges further feature broom cells, which are variably shaped, thin-walled, and measure 7–32 by 2.5–20µm. Their apical surfaces are covered with yellowish, <b>blunt,</b> <b>and</b> conical warts or incrustations 0.2–1.5 by 0.1–1µm.|$|E
5|$|Author Charles Higham {{claimed that}} Anthony Blunt, an MI5 agent and Soviet spy, acting on {{orders from the}} British royal family, made a {{successful}} secret trip to Schloss Friedrichshof in Germany {{towards the end of}} the war to retrieve sensitive letters between the Duke of Windsor and Adolf Hitler and other leading Nazis. What is certain is that George VI sent the Royal Librarian, Owen Morshead, accompanied by Blunt, then working part-time in the Royal Library as well as for British intelligence, to Friedrichshof in March 1945 to secure papers relating to the German Empress Victoria, the eldest child of Queen Victoria. Looters had stolen part of the castle's archive, including surviving letters between daughter and mother, as well as other valuables, some of which were recovered in Chicago after the war. The papers rescued by Morshead and <b>Blunt,</b> <b>and</b> those returned by the American authorities from Chicago, were deposited in the Royal Archives.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} <b>blunt</b> <b>and</b> dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The teeth of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more visible than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The teeth on the lower jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper teeth are visible when the mouth is closed. The teeth on the lower jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves {{on the outside of the}} top jaw making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E

Kaira's life takes a downturn when Raghuvendra (Kunal Kapoor), a film producer for whom she breaks up with her childhood sweetheart, gets engaged to someone else. Her landlord turns {{her out of her}} apartment because the building association wants to rent apartments only to married couples. All this plus dissatisfaction with her prospects at work serves as a catalyst for her shift to Goa, where she now has to grudgingly live with her parents (Aban Deohans and Atul Kale) with whom she has some issues. She ends up spending many sleepless nights in unhappiness and uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the success}} during the 1970s was due to new tactics and {{training}} methods brought to the club by Englishman Bob Houghton, who managed the club between 1974 and 1980. Eric Persson was succeeded as chairman in 1974 by Hans Cavalli-Björkman. After the team performed respectably under managers Keith <b>Blunt</b> <b>and</b> Tord Grip in the early 1980s, Roy Hodgson took over in 1985. He led the club to two Swedish Championships in 1986 and 1988, and the club won Allsvenskan five {{years in a row}} between 1985 and 1989. At the time, the championship was decided by play-offs between the best teams {{after the end of the}} regular season; this arrangement was in place from 1982 until 1992. The club reached the play-off final four times between 1986 and 1989 but only managed to win the final twice. Apart from Allsvenskan and Swedish Championships, the club won Svenska Cupen in 1984, 1986 and 1989.|$|E
5|$|The <b>blunt</b> <b>and</b> short claws of Deinocheirus {{are similar}} to those of the therizinosaur Alxasaurus, which {{indicates}} the long arms and claws were used for digging and gathering plants. The blunt claws of the feet could have helped the animal from sinking into substrate when wading. The robust hind limbs and hip region indicates the animal moved slowly. The large size of the animal may have helped it against predators such as Tarbosaurus, but in turn it lost the running ability of other ornithomimosaurs. The long neural spines and possible tail fan may have been used for display behaviour. Deinocheirus was likely diurnal (active during the day), since the sclerotic rings of the eyes were relatively small in comparison with its skull length. The hand had good mobility relative to the lower arm, but was capable of only a limited flexing motion, unable to close in grasping.|$|E

5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the thornback guitarfish is heart-shaped, slightly {{longer than it}} is wide, and thick towards the front. The snout is short and broad, with a blunt tip protruding slightly from the disc. The eyes are small and widely spaced; the spiracles are larger than the eyes and lie closely behind. The wide nostrils are preceded by moderately large, broad flaps of skin. The mouth is wide and gently arched; there are a pair of creases running from the mouth corners to the nostrils, enclosing a roughly trapezoidal area. The lower lip is inscribed by a deep furrow that wraps around the mouth corners. The small teeth have low crowns that may be sharp to <b>blunt,</b> <b>and</b> are arranged in 68–82 rows in the upper jaw and 64–78 rows in the lower jaw. The five pairs of gill slits are small and located beneath the disc.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous of all Arabian {{breeding}} operations founded in Europe was the Crabbet Park Stud of England, founded 1878. Starting in 1877, Wilfrid Scawen <b>Blunt</b> <b>and</b> Lady Anne Blunt made repeated journeys to the Middle East, including visits to the stud of Ali Pasha Sherif in Egypt and to Bedouin tribes in the Nejd, bringing the best Arabians they could find to England. Lady Anne also purchased and maintained the Sheykh Obeyd stud farm in Egypt, near Cairo. Upon Lady Anne's death in 1917, the Blunts' daughter, Judith, Lady Wentworth, inherited the Wentworth title and Lady Anne's portion of the estate, and obtained the remainder of the Crabbet Stud following a protracted legal battle with her father. Lady Wentworth expanded the stud, added new bloodstock, and exported Arabian horses worldwide. Upon her death in 1957, the stud passed to her manager, Cecil Covey, who ran Crabbet until 1971, when a motorway was cut through the property, forcing the sale of the land and dispersal of the horses. Along with Crabbet, the Hanstead Stud of Lady Yule also produced horses of worldwide significance.|$|E
5|$|The Young Victoria is a 2009 period drama film {{directed}} by Jean-Marc Vallée and written by Julian Fellowes. It {{centered on the}} early life and reign of Queen Victoria, including {{her relationship with her}} husband, Prince Albert. The film starred Emily <b>Blunt</b> <b>and</b> Rupert Friend among a large ensemble cast. Martin Scorsese, Graham King, and Sarah, Duchess of York served as its producers. A GK Films production, The Young Victoria was distributed by Momentum Pictures in the United Kingdom and by Apparition in the United States. Its world premiere was held on 5 February 2009 at the 59th Berlin International Film Festival while its UK premiere was held in London's Leicester Square on 3 March. The film was screened throughout 2009 and early 2010 at film festivals in Toronto, Sudbury, Ontario, Chicago, Hamptons, New York, Vermont, San Francisco, Denver, and San Joaquin, California. The Young Victorias theatrical release occurred on 6 March 2009 in the UK; it was released in a limited capacity in the US on 18 December 2009, and opened nationwide on Christmas Day.

40|$|The slip-line field {{around the}} tips of cracks was studied using {{electron}} scanning microscopy. Thin and thick tension specimens made of polycarbonate were edge-cracked ensuring predominant conditions of either plane stress or plane strain. The evolution of <b>blunting</b> <b>and</b> creation of the slip-line field in the intermediate phase between <b>blunting</b> <b>and</b> initiation of slow propagation of the crack were studied under a continuously increasing loading mode. Blunting depends {{on the type of}} stress state (plane stress or plane strain), mode of loading (mode I, mixed mode), and ductility of the material. Three different types of blunting were detected, the already known round-nosed and flat-nosed modes and an intermediate type of cornered and rounded-off front of the crack. The characteristic properties are presented. The slip-line fields accompanying <b>blunting</b> <b>and</b> indicating the initiation and evolution of the plastic enclaves were detected in all types of loading and specimens using the brittle-coating technique and its variations. It is shown that not only the plastic enclaves developed during this step of loading but also the significant elastic components of stresses influence the mode of development of the respective slip-line yielding a combined type in between the Rice-Johnson field for plane strain and the Theocaris field for plane stress...|$|R
