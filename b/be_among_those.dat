500|$|According to Raul Hilberg, Finkelstein {{displays}} [...] "academic {{courage to}} speak the truth when no one else is out there to support him... I would say that his place in the whole history of writing history is assured, and that those who in the end are proven right triumph, and he will <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> who will have triumphed, albeit, it so seems, at great cost." [...] In a peer review for Beyond Chutzpah, Avi Shlaim said that Finkelstein [...] "has a most impressive track record in exposing spurious American-Jewish scholarship on the Arab-Israeli conflict." [...] He praised Finkelstein for [...] "all the sterling qualities for which he has become famous: erudition, originality, spark, meticulous attention to detail, intellectual integrity, courage, and formidable forensic skills." ...|$|E

500|$|But {{where he}} will be missed the most will <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> {{people who have been}} sharers of his bounty. [...] Their name is legion. [...] He gave quietly, but he gave liberally. [...] It was true of him that he did not let his right hand know what his left hand did. [...] Very {{frequently}} the recipient of his bounty could only guess from whence the gift came. [...] He aided the needy in distress in thousands of ways. [...] He seemed to have some occult way of finding out that people needed assistance at certain times, and then he knew how to come to their aid without offending. [...] Hundreds whom the public would never dream had needed his assistance blessed his name as they gazed upon his features for the last time, because he came to them in a substantial way at a critical time. [...] This is where and by whom he will be missed the most. [...] Truly he was a great man.|$|E
500|$|Wilton {{was still}} only a {{substantive}} captain {{at the end}} of hostilities, but was considered by the Military Board to <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> [...] "promising officers who have forced their way to the top during the war" [...] and hence to deserve retention of their wartime rank. He became Deputy Director of Military Operations and Plans at Army Headquarters (AHQ), Melbourne, in March 1946, and took charge of the same directorate a year later. By now promoted to substantive colonel, in 1950 {{he was a member of}} the Bridgeford Mission, which advised the Australian government on the state of the Malayan Emergency. On a visit to Singapore in Februaryâ€“March 1951 as part of a joint planning team, he urged his British counterparts to maintain their presence in Malaya as the basis of a combined force, without which Australia would be reluctant to commit any troops for the region's security. [...] Wilton relinquished his post at AHQ in November 1951, and attended the Imperial Defence College in London during 1952. Having been assigned a combat command in the Korean War, he was promoted to brigadier on 13March 1953, arrived in Seoul within the week, and took over the 28thCommonwealth Brigade from fellow Duntroon graduate Brigadier Thomas Daly on 25March.|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for dropping {{an atomic bomb}} on Hiroshima, the Oppenheimer-led Scientific Panel of the Interim Committee decided against a demonstration bomb and against a special leaflet warning. Those decisions were implemented because of the uncertainty of a successful detonation and {{also because of the}} wish to maximize shock in the leadership. No warning was given to Hiroshima that a new and much more destructive bomb was going to be dropped. Various sources gave conflicting information about when the last leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima prior to the atomic bomb. Robert Jay Lifton wrote that it was July 27, and Theodore H. McNelly wrote that it was July 3. The USAAF history noted that eleven cities were targeted with leaflets on July 27, but Hiroshima was not one of them, and there were no leaflet sorties on July 30. Leaflet sorties were undertaken on August 1 and August 4. Hiroshima may have been leafleted in late July or early August, as survivor accounts talk about a delivery of leaflets {{a few days before the}} atomic bomb was dropped. Three versions were printed of a leaflet listing 11 or 12 cities targeted for firebombing; a total of 33 cities listed. With the text of this leaflet reading in Japanese [...] "...we cannot promise that only these cities will <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> attacked..." [...] Hiroshima is not listed.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Professor of Bioethics Arthur Caplan stated, [...] "Look, I {{think you}} can make the {{connections}} that...they are using prisoners, and they need prisoners who are relatively healthy, they need prisoners who are relatively younger. It doesn't take a great stretch of the imagination that some Falun Gong [...] are going to <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> {{who are going to be}} killed for parts. It just follows, because remember you can't take very old people as sources of organs and you can't take people who are very sick. They, Falun Gong, are in part younger, and by lifestyle, healthier. I would be astounded if they weren't using some of those prisoners as sources of organs." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{result of}} all this is that only 16 episodes {{remained}} in the archives when the BBC realised the value of such material, including the first and last episodes in broadcast order. These were mainly in the form of 35mm film telerecordings, with a handful of episodes as 16mm film recordings or reduction prints. In the case of some episodes, the 35mm location footage also exists, and has been used to remaster those surviving episodes. The last episode of Series One, [...] "D For Destruction", thought to <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> lost forever, was recovered in 2003, in the BBC Archives in a mislabelled film can.

2500|$|Joe Szadkowski of The Washington Post {{suggested}} that each CD on Madeline 1st and 2nd Grade Math covers one year's worth of educational material. Software and CD-ROM Reviews on File wrote the Madeline Classroom Companion games contained the [...] "basic elements of [...] school curriculum" [...] citing Philip Bishop's Family PC review which said the games [...] "constitute two complete years of learning, covering pre-reading, pre-math, thinking skills, and creativity."

2500|$|Pete Vonder Haar of the Film Threat {{gave the}} film a mixed review, stating: [...] "It's a {{reasonably}} entertaining actioner, and Zwick doesn't {{shy away from}} depicting violence or the horrors of war, but as a social statement it falls a little short. And emeralds are prettier anyway." [...] Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle also gave the film a mixed review, he stated: [...] "While the film never quite reaches the emotional peaks it so obviously seeks to scale, Zwick's film is still potent enough to save you three months salary." [...] Nathan Lee of the Village Voice, like Vonder Haar and Savlov, also gave the film a mixed review, stating that [...] "De Beers can relax; the only indignation stirred up by Blood Diamond won't <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> who worry about where their jewelry came from, but with audiences incensed by facile politics and bad storytelling." [...] Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club gave the film [...] "C", he stated: [...] "Much like Zwick's Glory and The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond strives to be an [...] "important" [...] film while stopping well short of being genuinely provocative and artistically chancy." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a negative review, stating that [...] "director Edward Zwick {{tried to make a}} great movie, but somewhere in the process he forgot to make a good one." ...|$|E
