5|$|During {{the course}} of its investigation, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{discovered}} that tower staffing levels at <b>Blue</b> <b>Grass</b> Airport violated an internal policy as reflected in a November 16, 2005, memorandum requiring two controllers during the overnight shift: one in the tower working clearance, ground, and tower frequencies, and another, either in the tower or remotely at Indianapolis Center, working TRACON (radar). At {{the time of the}} accident, the single controller in the tower was performing both tower and radar duties. On August 30, 2006, the FAA announced that Lexington, as well as other airports with similar traffic levels, would be staffed with two controllers in the tower around the clock effective immediately.|$|E

5|$|Davenport {{public schools}} serve nearly 17,000 {{students}} in the communities of Davenport, <b>Blue</b> <b>Grass,</b> Buffalo, and Walcott. The Davenport Community School District is the second-largest school district in Iowa. Davenport has four public high schools: Central, West, Mid City and North and one private high school: Assumption. There are six public intermediate schools and 23 public elementary schools. Sudlow, one of the intermediate schools, was named after Phebe Sudlow, the first female public school superintendent in the United States. She was superintendent for Davenport schools from 1874 to 1878. The high schools {{are part of the}} Mississippi Athletic Conference for sports. The city has four colleges and universities: Palmer Chiropractic College, which is the first chiropractic school and the location of the first chiropractic adjustment in the world, Saint Ambrose University, Kaplan University, and Hamilton Technical College. Marycrest International University was a university in Davenport from 1939 to 2002, when it closed and became senior citizen housing.|$|E
5|$|On May 2, American Pharoah {{started as}} the 2.9â€“1 {{favorite}} in an eighteen-runner {{field for the}} 141st running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs. His opponents included Dortmund, winner of the Santa Anita Derby; Carpe Diem, who won the Breeders' Futurity Stakes and <b>Blue</b> <b>Grass</b> Stakes; Firing Line, winner of the Sunland Derby; Wood Memorial winner Frosted; Florida Derby winner Materiality; international entry Mubtaahij, who earned his way to Kentucky with a win in the UAE Derby; and Upstart, winner of the Holy Bull Stakes. The crowd surrounding the horse during the walk-over from the barns to the paddock upset American Pharoah, and several grooms were required to keep him under control. He continued to misbehave until he was loaded into the starting gate; his connections and supporters worried that he was using up energy he needed for the race.|$|E
5|$|Sham, {{who had won}} the Santa Anita Derby, {{was seen}} as the most {{formidable}} challenger to Secretariat in the Derby because of his finish ahead of Secretariat in the Wood and his Santa Anita victory. Coming off the heels of the his victory at the Wood, Angle Light was seen as a threat to win. Angle Light was also trained by Lucien Laurin, along with as Secretariat, and thus Secretariat and Angle Light were coupled for betting purposes. Flamingo Stakes winner Our Native finished first or second in seven of his nine starts during the 1973 season, causing him to be named as a contender. <b>Blue</b> <b>Grass</b> Stakes winner My Gallant and Shecky Greene, who won the Fountain of Youth Stakes, were both trained in Chicago by Lou Goldline, which also resulted in their odds being coupled. Goldline said the two horses were similar and would do well at Churchill Downs because they both liked fast tracks. Impecunious, who was victorious in the Arkansas Derby, was initially entered in the race, but withdrew two days before because of a bruised heel. None of the competing horses had been sired by a previous Derby winner.|$|E

40|$|Salinity of {{soil and}} {{irrigation}} water creates major problems for forage production. This study was aimed to evaluate {{the quality and quantity}} of forage production in intercropping of kochia (Kochia scoparia L.) with <b>blue</b> panic <b>grass</b> (Panicum antidotale Retz.) under irrigation with saline water (4. 9 dS. m- 1). The study was performed based on randomized complete block design with three replications during growing season 2010 - 2011 at Salinity Research Field, of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. Treatments were five different levels including 100, 75, 50, 25 and 0 percentage of relative composition of the two species. Treatment of 50 % <b>blue</b> panic <b>grass</b> and 50 % kochia with an average of 1408 g. m- 2 produced the highest dry matter yield followed by 25 % <b>blue</b> panic <b>grass</b> + 75 % kochia and 75 % <b>blue</b> panic <b>grass</b> + 25 % kochia produced 1317 and 993 g. m- 2, respectively. Due to lower growth rate of <b>blue</b> panic <b>grass</b> in the first year, a large proportion of dry matter in the mixture was associated with kochia and land equivalent ratio was less than one in all intercropping treatments. In the first and the second clippings, there was no significant difference between intercropping treatments in terms of crude protein, ash, NDF and ADF...|$|R
5|$|While in Lexington for a {{deposition}} on May 26, 2002, Wilkinson began to experience chest pains and {{was admitted to}} St. Joseph's Hospital. Doctors diagnosed him with arterial blockages and scheduled him for arterial bypass surgery. Before the surgery could be performed, however, doctors discovered another lymphatic mass. Wilkinson began taking chemotherapy, and doctors removed the mass on June 4, 2002. Wilkinson was placed on life support on June 26, 2002. He suffered a stroke on July 4, 2002. Wilkinson had previously instructed his family not to continue life support after all hope of recovery was gone; accordingly, they decided to withdraw life support, and Wilkinson died on July 5, 2002. He was originally buried at <b>Blue</b> <b>Grass</b> Memorial Gardens in Nicholasville, Kentucky. In August 2002, his coffin was moved to a locked mausoleum at Sarasota Memorial Park in Sarasota, Florida; the family chose July 4, 2002 as the date of death for his marker.
