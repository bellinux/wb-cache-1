Minerals extracted from the lake include: sodium chloride (common salt), used in water softeners, salt lick blocks for livestock, and to melt ice on local roadways (food-grade salt is not produced from the lake, as it would require further costly processing to ensure its purity); potassium sulfate, used as a commercial fertilizer; and magnesium-chloride brine, used in the production of magnesium metal, chlorine gas, and as a dust suppressant. US Magnesium operates a plant on the southwest shore of the lake, which produces 14 percent of the worldwide supply of magnesium, more than any other North American magnesium operation. Mineral-extraction companies operating on the lake pay royalties on their products to the State of Utah, which owns the lake.|$|E

25|$|In May 2009, King Abdullah {{gave the}} go-ahead {{for a new}} National Water Strategy until 2022, {{replacing}} an earlier Water Strategy from 1998. The strategy included investments of Jordanian Dinar 5.86 billion (US$8.24 billion) {{over a period of}} 15 years, corresponding to more than 160% of Jordan's GDP. It also foresaw a decreasing reliance on groundwater from 32% in 2007 to 17%, increased use of treated wastewater in agriculture from 10% to 13% and increased use of desalination from 1% to 31%. According to then-Minister of Water, Raed Abu Soud, even after the completion of the Disi Water Conveyance Project, the water deficit in 2022 would be about 500 million cubic metres, highlighting the need to include desalination under the Red Sea-Dead Sea canal in the strategy. The strategy also envisaged institutional reforms such as enacting a new water law, separating operational from administrative functions, as well as production from distribution operations, creating a Water Council with advisory functions and establishing a Water Regulatory Commission. While the legal and institutional reforms were not implemented, the Disi Water Conveyance Project was completed in 2013 by the Turkish firm Gama. The influx of about one million refugees from Syria since 2012 increased the population of Jordan to more than nine million. It also increased water demand substantially. For lack of finaning, the Red Sea-Dead Sea Canal is not being pursued any more in its original form for the time being. Instead, a scaled-down, more realistic version is being pursued. This project involves a water swap between Jordan and Israel, with Jordan supplying desalinated water from Aqaba to Southern Israel, while Israel provides additional water from the Sea of Galilee to Northern Jordan. <b>Brine</b> <b>water</b> from the desalination plant is to be supplied to the Dead Sea. As of 2015, the bidding for the desalination plant at Aqaba was under preparation.|$|E

40|$|Most {{oil wells}} {{eventually}} produce some quantity of reservoir <b>brine</b> (formation <b>water)</b> over their lifetime. Increased water production is usually indicated {{by a significant}} increase in the water to oil ratio (WOR) of the well. As the WOR of well increases, it causes costly added water handling, it reduces efficiency of the depletion mechanism, the afflicted well may be abandoned early, there can be loss of the total field overall recovery, and because reservoir <b>brine</b> (formation <b>water)</b> is corrosive its disposal becomes expensive. In this work, a simple Arrhenius type function is presented for estimation of reservoir <b>brine</b> (formation <b>water)</b> properties for temperatures above 30 °C and salt contents between 5 % and 25 % by mass. An Arrhenius type function has been selected because it is easier than existing approaches, less complicated with fewer computations, and suitable for engineers. These expressions can then be incorporated into further calculations that require predictions of reservoir <b>brine</b> (formation <b>water)</b> properties as functions of temperature and salt content. Estimations are found to be in excellent agreement with the reliable data in the literature with average absolute deviation being around 0. 09 – 2. 6 %. The tool developed in this study can be useful for the petroleum engineers to have a quick check on the reservoir brine properties at various conditions without opting for any experimental measurements. In particular, chemical and petroleum engineers would find the proposed approach to be user-friendly with transparent calculations involving no complex expressions...|$|R

The distribution of river <b>water</b> and <b>brine</b> enriched <b>waters</b> on the Laptev Sea shelf is derived based on mass balance calculations using salinity and δ 18 O data. While in 1994 maximal influence of brines is seen within bottom waters [Bauch et al., 2009 a], in 2007 the influence of brines is highest within the surface layer and only a moderate influence of brines is observed in the bottom layer. In contrast to 2007, salinity and δ 18 O data from summer 1994 clearly identify a locally formed <b>brine</b> enriched bottom <b>water</b> mass as mixing endmember between surface layer and inner shelf waters on one side and with higher salinity water from the outer Laptev Sea on the other side. In 2007 the <b>brine</b> enriched <b>waters</b> are predominantly part of the surface regime and the mixing endmember between surface layer and outer shelf waters is replaced by a relatively salty bottom water mass. This relatively salty bottom water probably originates from the western Laptev Sea. The inverted distribution of <b>brines</b> in the <b>water</b> column in 2007 relative to 1994 suggests a less effective winter sea-ice formation in winter 2006 / 2007 combined with advection of more saline waters from the western Laptev Sea or the outer shelf precedent to 1 the climatically extreme summer 2007.
