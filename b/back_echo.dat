2500|$|The guitar {{controller}} for Rock Band, {{modeled after}} a Fender Stratocaster, {{is used for}} lead guitar and bass guitar gameplay. It has several features akin to Guitar Heros controller, as it features five colored fret buttons on {{the neck of the}} guitar (which correspond to on-screen notes), a strum bar, and a whammy bar. To use the guitar controller, players must hold the fret button that corresponds to the scrolling colored note on-screen while simultaneously pushing the strum bar. In addition, five smaller fret buttons are located further down on the neck. [...] These buttons can be used to play all notes in guitar solos (denoted by the note track turning blue) as hammer-ons and pull-offs, without the need to strum. The whammy bar can be used to distort the sound of held notes. A special effects switch can be used to toggle between five different guitar effects during solos and Overdrive periods (ranging from wah-wah, flange, chorus, echo, distortion, doubler, slap <b>back</b> <b>echo,</b> medium echo, and long echo), however, this switch was removed from the Rock Band 3 edition of the guitar. Overdrive for guitarists can be deployed by holding the controller in a vertical position or pressing the [...] "Select/Back/-" [...] button. The controller is offered in both wired and wireless versions. Rock Band games allow players to apply a [...] "Lefty Flip" [...] setting, supporting left-handed guitar players. [...] The second version of the controller, distributed with Rock Band 2, introduced quieter fret buttons, a more reliable strum bar, and optical sensor and microphone to help the player calibrate the video and audio output from their television/stereo system's setup.|$|E
5000|$|Echo {{enters the}} {{interrogation}} room and makes Bennett a deal. If Bennett brings Caroline <b>back,</b> <b>Echo</b> will hold Caroline down and let Bennett have at her. In DeWitt's office, DeWitt believes Mr. Ambrose is {{in more than one}} body. She plans to let the others know that Boyd killed one of them, and Boyd will need to run to draw their fire. As Topher finishes up restoring all the actives' original selves, he and Bennett begin work on Caroline's wedge again. In a scene previously shown as a flashback in [...] "Epitaph One", Boyd packs to leave and promises to return for Dr. Saunders. Bennett and Topher flirt once again, and kiss passionately. Topher leaves the room to get some tools as Dr. Saunders walks in, where she expresses that Bennett is remarkable for being able to provoke love in someone like Topher. Topher walks back into the room and Dr. Saunders shoots Bennett in the head.|$|E
5000|$|Two years later, Bill Haley and the Saddlemen {{had already}} {{achieved}} some success with their cover of Ike Turner's (and/or Jackie Brenston's) [...] "Rocket 88", but {{were looking for}} another hit. They were persuaded by their producer, Essex Records owner Dave Miller, to cover [...] "Rock The Joint" [...] - a song which, like [...] "Rocket 88", had already been successful with R&B audiences. Haley recorded the song (the exact location is unknown but {{is believed to have}} been recorded in the band's hometown of Chester, Pennsylvania http://thegardnerfamily.org/haley/discography/recordings.html) in February or March 1952, but made up verses of his own to appeal to his country audience, named a succession of hillbilly dances (such as the Sugarfoot Rag and Virginia Reel) in place of Preston's hucklebuck and jitterbug, and also used different instrumentation on the track, and more <b>back</b> <b>echo.</b> In particular, Haley's version used a prominent percussive slapped bass played by Marshall Lytle http://thegardnerfamily.org/haley/discography/recordings.html and electric guitar by Danny Cedrone, with a lick he duplicated two years later on [...] "Rock Around The Clock".|$|E

50|$|The {{message of}} the song {{parallels}} a theme of John Steinbeck's seminal novel The Grapes of Wrath, wherein the Joad family makes a dangerous, expensive trip {{from their home in}} Oklahoma to California. They encounter a fellow Dust Bowl migrant at a roadside rest-stop who tells them to turn <b>back,</b> <b>echoing</b> the cautionary tone of the song. He cites his own loss and misfortune (he mentions the trials of his dead wife and his underfed children 'moaning like pups') as a warning to others to avoid the same fate. Continuing on in spite of this, the Joads arrive in California nearly penniless, and having buried the two oldest members of the family. There they find there is indeed not enough work or pay to make ends meet.|$|R

40|$|Prior {{studies have}} shown that {{ultrasonic}} velocity/time-of-flight imaging that uses <b>back</b> surface <b>echo</b> reflections to gauge volumetric material quality is well suited (perhaps more so than is the commonlyused peak amplitude c-scanning) for quantitative characterization of microstructural gradients. Such gradients include those due to pore fraction, density, fiber fraction, and chemical composition variations [11 – 15]. Variations in these microstructural factors can affect the uniformity of physical performance (including mechanical [stiffness, strength], thermal [conductivity], and electrical [conductivity, superconducting transition temperature], etc. performance) of monolithic and composite [1, 3, 6, 12]. A weakness of conventional ultrasonic velocity/time-of-flight imaging (as well as to a lesser extent ultrasonic peak amplitude c-scanning where <b>back</b> surface <b>echoes</b> are gated [17] is that the image shows the effects of thickness as well as microstructural variations unless the part is uniformly thick. This limits this type of imaging’s usefulness in practical applications. The effect of thickness is easily observed from the equation for pulse-echo waveform time-of-flight (2 τ) between the first front surface echo (FS) and the first <b>back</b> surface <b>echo</b> (B 1), or between two successive <b>back</b> surface <b>echoes</b> where: 2 τ=(2 d) V (1) where d is the sample thickness and V is the velocity of ultrasound in the material. Interpretation of the time-of-flight image is difficult as thickness variation effects can mask or overemphasize the true microstructural variation portrayed in the image of a part containing thickness variations. Thickness effects on time-of-flight can also be interpreted by rearranging equation (1) to calculate velocity: V=(2 d) 2 τ (2) such that velocity is inversely proportional to time-of-flight. Velocity and time-of-flight maps will be affected similarly (although inversely in terms of magnitude) by thickness variations, and velocity maps are used in this investigation to indicate time-of-flight variations...|$|R
