50|$|The histologic {{appearance}} of these tumors varied, but all shared the common feature of a biphasic proliferation of epithelial (strong cytokeratin-positive; actin and S-100-negative) and myoepithelial (strong actin and S-100 and focal weak cytokeratin-positive) cells with formation of bilayered ductlike structures. The focal resemblance to other salivary gland-type tumors may cause diagnostic difficulties, particularly in small endobronchial biopsies. Although {{little is known}} about their <b>biologic</b> <b>potential</b> due to limited follow-up data, these tumors when in the lung clearly have the capacity to infiltrate and metastasize and therefore should be designated as epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma.

40|$|Background/Aim. Gastrointestinal (GI) stromal tumors (GIST) are {{the most}} common mesenchymal tumors of GI tract. The most {{frequent}} localization is gastric (60 - 70 %) followed by intestinal localization (20 - 30 %). The histogenesis, classification, diagnostic criteria and biological behavior of GIST are still discussable. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are thought to originate from interstitial pacemaker intestinal cells of Cajal. Histologic appearance of a GIST is complicated and <b>biologic</b> <b>potential</b> unpredictable. The aim of of tha study was to investigate anatomic localization, the size of the tumor, incapsulation, microscopic and immunohistochemical characteristics. Methods. The study involved 21 GIST taken by a complete resection in the period from 1994 - 2006. The analysed parameters were the localization, size, microscopic (mitotic index, nectosis, bleeding, invasivity) and immunohistochemical characteristics (CD 117 (ckit), CD 34, desmin, vimentin, smooth muscle actin and s- 100 protein expression. Results. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (n= 21) size varied from 10 - 150 mm were most frequently gastric localised with predominance of malignant tumors (85. 72 %). Most GIST were comprised of a uniform spindle cell population, but some were dominated by epitheloid cells. Eosinophilic cells stained CD 117, CD 34 and vimentin positively, were usually arranged in fascicles with the presence of skeinoid fibers. Positive correlation of <b>biologic</b> <b>potential</b> and tumor size, haemorrhagia and mitotic index were found, so as negative correlation of <b>biologic</b> <b>potential</b> and incapsulation. Conclusion. The above results, a specially localization, tumor size, mitotic index, CD 117, CD 34 and vimentin positivity, may be helpful for setting of a widespread criteria for diagnostic and differential diagnosis of GIST and their use in practice and therapy. ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Atypical Spitz tumors (AST) {{are rare}} spitzoid melanocytic proliferations with an {{uncertain}} malignant potential. ASTs have overlapping features of both Spitz nevi and spitzoid melanoma, and consequently generate controversy with diagnosis and management. Sentinel {{lymph node biopsy}} (SLNB) has been proposed as a possible means to gain additional insight into the true <b>biologic</b> <b>potential</b> of these tumors; however, previous reports {{on the use of}} SLNB in ASTs have been limited by small numbers of patients and short durations of follow-up. METHODS: The authors extracted data from their institution's prospective melanoma database, collected between 1994 and 2007, for all patients with ASTs of uncertain <b>biologic</b> <b>potential.</b> They reviewed the clinical features of these patients, including the sentinel lymph node status, and the histological features of the tumors. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients with ASTs were identified, with a median age of 23. 7 years. The mean depth was 2. 4 mm. Of these, 57 had a SLNB performed, with 27 (47 %) having a positive sentinel lymph node. SLNB-positive cases had a significantly lower mean age than SLNB-negative cases (17. 9 vs 28. 7 years; P =. 013); however, no other significant differences were observed. All 27 patients with a positive SLNB were alive and disease free with median follow-up of 43. 8 months. One patient who did not receive a SLNB developed recurrent disease with regional and distant metastases. CONCLUSIONS: ASTs do not appear to behave like conventional melanoma. There is a high incidence of microscopic lymph node deposits in SLNBs, but despite this finding, patients have a favorable prognosis. Our findings raise several questions regarding the malignant potential of ASTs, and the role of SLNB in their management. Cancer 2009. © 2009 American Cancer Society...|$|E
