However, no space for any tracks was ever built because of Moses's opposition to the expansion of New York City public transportation.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of Oslo, the North Line (now named the Gjøvik Line) was being built as {{standard}} gauge; it was considered the new mainline northwards, and was to <b>be</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> the mainline through Gudbrandsdalen. By building a branch line from Roa to Hønefoss, the Bergens Line could <b>be</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> Nordbanen, allowing standard gauge trackage all the way to Oslo Østbanestasjon (Oslo Ø). This also gave another advantage, as Oslo Ø was seen as superior to Oslo V; the latter only served limited commuter routes west of town while Oslo Ø was the main station for long-distance trains to Trondheim, as well as Gothenburg and Stockholm in Sweden, with whom Norway was in a union with at the time. Only by terminating at Oslo Ø would direct transfer to trains {{to other parts of the}} country be possible.|$|E

5|$|A trade {{route is}} a {{logistical}} network {{identified as a}} series of pathways and stoppages used for the commercial transport of cargo. The term {{can also be used to}} refer to trade over bodies of water. Allowing goods to reach distant markets, a single trade route contains long distance arteries, which may further <b>be</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> smaller networks of commercial and noncommercial transportation routes. Among notable trade routes was the Amber Road, which served as a dependable network for long-distance trade. Maritime trade along the Spice Route became prominent during the Middle Ages, when nations resorted to military means for control of this influential route. During the Middle Ages, organizations such as the Hanseatic League, aimed at protecting interests of the merchants, and trade became increasingly prominent.|$|E

5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply <b>be</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> a larger PA system if the volume onstage from the {{built-in}} amplifier is too quiet.
