Junk mail classification using machine learning techniques {{is a key}} method to fight spam. We have devised a machine learning algorithm where features are created from individual sentences in the subject and <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> by forming all possible word-pairings from a sentence. Weights are assigned to the features based {{on the strength of}} their predictive capabilities for spam/legitimate determination. The predictive capabilities are estimated by the frequency of occurrence of the feature in spam/legitimate collections as well as by application of heuristic rules. During classification, total spam and legitimate evidence in the message is obtained by summing up the weights of extracted features of each class and the message is classified into whichever class accumulates the greater sum. We compared the algorithm against the popular naÃ¯ve-bayes algorithm (in [8]) and found it 2 ̆ 7 s performance exceeded that of naÃ¯ve-bayes algorithm both in terms of catching spam and for reducing false positives...|$|E

The present study was an attempt to determine politeness accommodation in e-mail messages among Iranian postgraduate students of EFL. One hundred EFL learners, aged 22 - 26, participated in this study. Four different message types were constructed and sent to the participants, i. e. messages with verbal politeness markers; messages with structural politeness elements (e. g., salutation and closing remarks); messages with both verbal and structural politeness indicators; finally messages with neither verbal nor structural politeness indicators. Further, the messages varied in their degree of politeness; however, their content was the same. Results showed that the participants accommodated significantly to verbal politeness indicators in the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>message,</b> and to structural politeness indicators of greeting/salutation. When such indicators were included in messages, the participants responded with significantly more polite messages (greeting and body) than when the indicators were absent.

For instance, financial transfers are typically represented as structured records, with such fields as sending bank, sending account number, currency, amount, date, receiving account, etc. Most fields are well-defined, like a date, a dollar amount, or the receiving bank.

30|$|The IP {{messages}} in several routing protocols {{are composed of}} two parts: packet header and the payload (<b>body</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message).</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> composition (IP header and message payload in the same body), the IP header becomes as an overhead for protocol communication. As it is known, the most units in the smart sensor node hardware that consumes more power is wireless transceiver, which is used for communication. As a result, the power consumption is greatly affected when any transition or receiving occurs, even during the listening when the transceiver is idle. To solve this problem, the compression technique {{should be used to}} shorten IP header [34].|$|R

5000|$|Software {{that creates}} machine-processable {{structure}} can utilize the linguistic, auditory, and visual structure {{that exist in}} all forms of human communication. Algorithms can infer this inherent structure from text, for instance, by examining word morphology, sentence syntax, and other small- and large-scale patterns. Unstructured information can then be enriched and tagged to address ambiguities and relevancy-based techniques then used to facilitate search and discovery. Examples of [...] "unstructured data" [...] may include books, journals, documents, metadata, health records, audio, video, analog data, images, files, and unstructured text such as the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> e-mail <b>message,</b> Web page, or word-processor document. While the main content being conveyed {{does not have a}} defined structure, it generally comes packaged in objects (e.g. in files or documents, …) that themselves have structure and are thus <b>a</b> mix <b>of</b> structured and unstructured data, but collectively this is still referred to as [...] "unstructured data". For example, an HTML web page is tagged, but HTML mark-up typically serves solely for rendering. It does not capture the meaning or function of tagged elements in ways that support automated processing of the information content of the page. XHTML tagging does allow machine processing of elements, although it typically does not capture or convey the semantic meaning of tagged terms.|$|R
30|$|The {{format of}} data {{encapsulated}} into the <b>body</b> part <b>of</b> the SIP Message requests {{is based on}} the Cisco® R 6 interface [32], which consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> control and bearer plane communication protocols between BS and ASN-GW [33]. In short, in our implementation each data packet is encoded as a binary Type-Length-Value (TLV) data structure and located within the <b>body</b> field <b>of</b> <b>a</b> SIP <b>Message</b> request. After receiving such a request, the recipient replies with a final SIP response with an empty body (i.e., 200 OK) [28]. The ASN-GW encapsulates the R 6 message into the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> SIP Message requests. In this way, the modifications needed in the ASN-GW are marginal, since it only has to encapsulate the relevant R 6 and IGMP protocol <b>messages</b> into <b>a</b> SIP <b>message</b> body. Thus, they affect the implementation effort and the complexity of the signaling architecture on the MBSC-SS only. If needed, given the SLEE flexibility and extendibility, the MBSC-SS can easily be modified, so as to support other R 6 protocols, different from the Cisco® version.|$|R
