25|$|According to Danny's {{speech at}} the end of the film, 'We are 91 days from the end of this decade and there's gonna <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> refugees'. This means the drug-addled scene after the pair return from Penrith occurs on Thursday 2 October 1969, six weeks after Woodstock and three days before the first {{broadcast}} of Monty Python's Flying Circus. It is not known if Robinson intended any significance by including such a specific date.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there seemed}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> enthusiasm for Kliper within Alan Thirkettle’s team at ESA (as {{outlined}} in the above paragraph), on December 7, 2005, the European space summit of governmental officials of ESA member states declined to approve a 50-million-euro two-year study focusing on ESA's potential involvement in the Kliper project. In denying funding for the study ESA members stated that, among other factors that seemed unfavourable, under the current Russian proposal Europe would not share control over {{the design of the}} program and would be limited to being a small industrial contributor.|$|E

25|$|Haiman {{describes}} iconic {{expression and}} conceptual distance and how two concepts are conceptually close if they share semantic properties, affect {{each other and}} cannot be separated from one another. Joseph Greenberg hypothesizes that {{the distance between the}} possessor and possessee in a sentence with alienable possession will be greater than it will be in sentences inalienable constructions. Because the possessor and the possessee have a close conceptual relationship, their relative positions with a sentence reflect this and there will not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> distance between them. Increasing the distance between the two would in turn increase their conceptual independence.|$|E
25|$|Ajaan Maha Bua, on {{the other}} hand, saw what he {{considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> strange ideas being taught about meditation in Bangkok in the later decades of the 20th century. For that reason Ajaan Maha Bua decided to vividly describe how each noble attainment is reached, even though doing so indirectly revealed that he was confident he had attained a noble level. Though the Vinaya prohibits a monk from directly revealing ones own or another's attainments to laypeople while that person is still alive, Ajaan Maha Bua wrote in Ajaan Mun's posthumous biography that {{he was convinced that}} Ajaan Mun was an arahant. Thanissaro Bhikkhu remarks that this was a significant change of the teaching etiquette within the Forest Tradition.|$|E
25|$|There will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> {{sympathy for}} Watkins {{when he takes}} the field tomorrow. His {{selection}} was not 24-hours-old when it was fiercely assailed by a former Australian Test captain who advocated eleventh hour reconsideration by the Test selectors. Happily, Messrs Harvey, Loxton and Ridings know their own minds and stuck to their decision so Watkins will have his big chance tomorrow against an array of experienced batsmen of the highest class, who have been playing good spin bowling since they left school. Those who watched Watkins' performance at the MCG for NSW against Victoria at Christmas {{do not agree with}} the pundits who have criticised his selection. Very simply, we have no Maileys, no Grimmetts, no O'Reillys. Our best spinner is Ashley Mallett, who cannot go to the Caribbean and is therefore omitted tomorrow. Watkins is, at least, as well worth a punt as anyone else and would be amazed if the selectors confine him to the 12th man role.|$|E

500|$|Jessica Morgan, however, from Television Without Pity, {{gave the}} episode a more mixed review. She criticized the {{character}} of Monica Reyes and called her [...] "Moronica".

In March 2014, playwright Rolin Jones told the Hartford Courant that he was writing a new screenplay for the film. Comparing it to the musical, Jones said, [...] "The {{idea is to get}} it a little dirtier and a little nastier and translate it into visual terms. There's not going to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> dialogue and it probably should be a little shorter, too. After that, it just takes its 'movie time' in getting done".

[...] According to Brice Ezell of PopMatters, [...] "for whatever reason [...] never gets off of the ground."

500|$|In {{addition}} to the setting, {{part of the original}} concept for the show was that there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> advanced technology similar to that seen in Star Trek, but it would be constantly malfunctioning. The automatic doors at Applied Cryogenics resemble those in however, they malfunction when Fry remarks on this similarity. In another twist, the two policemen who try to arrest Fry at the head museum use weapons which are visually similar to lightsabers used in the Star Wars film series; however, they are functionally more similar to nightsticks. The interaction between the characters was not overlooked. The relationship formed between Fry and Bender in this episode has been compared to the relationship between Will Robinson and the robot in Lost in Space.|$|E

Meyer says that she does not consciously intend her novels to be Mormon-influenced, or to promote the virtues of sexual abstinence and spiritual purity, but admits that her writing is shaped by her values, saying, [...] "I don't think my books are going to be really graphic or dark, because of who I am.
