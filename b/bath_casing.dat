5000|$|In practice, the {{arrangement}} {{had a number}} of disadvantages. Cracks developed in the oil <b>bath</b> <b>casing</b> due to incorrect welding procedure. Condensation caused corrosion, and oil leaked out through inadequate seals, causing wheelslip and fire hazards. Valve timing was highly unpredictable; this has been attributed to chain stretch, although Bulleid claimed that it was allowed for. The chains were replaced as part of a valve and piston examination at around 30,000 to 36,000 mi, by which time they were considerably worn. This wear, in the chain pins and sprockets, could result in an elongation of the chains by as much as 6 in. Bulleid asserted that a slack of 3 in would be absorbed by the chain coming under load, with the remaining valve irregularity corrected by adjusting the cut-off.|$|E
