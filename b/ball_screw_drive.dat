40|$|This thesis {{studies in}} detail the {{dynamics}} of ball screw feed drives and expands understanding {{of the factors that}} impose limitations on their performance. This knowledge is then used for developing control strategies that provide adequate command following and disturbance rejection. High performance control strategies proposed in this thesis are designed for, and implemented on, a custom-made <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> <b>drive.</b> A hybrid Finite Element (FE) model for the <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> is developed and coded in Matlab programming language. This FE model is employed for prediction of natural frequencies, mode shapes, and Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) of the ball screw setup. The accuracy of FRFs predicted for the ball screw mechanism alone is validated against the experimental measurements obtained through impact hammer testing. Next, the FE model for the entire test setup is validated. The dynamic characteristics of the actuator current controller are also modeled. In addition, the modal parameters of the mechanical structure are extracted from measured FRFs, which include the effects of current loop dynamics. To ensure adequate command following and disturbance rejection, three motion controllers with active vibration damping capability are developed. The first is based on the sensor averaging concept which facilitates position control of the rigid body dynamics. Active damping is added to suppress vibrations. To achieve satisfactory steady state response, integral action over the tracking error is included. The stability analysis and tuning procedure for this controller is presented together with experimental results that prove the effectiveness of this method in high-speed tracking and cutting applications. The second design uses the pole placement technique to move the real component of two of the oscillatory poles further to the left along the real axis. This yields a faster rigid body response with less vibration. However, the time delay from the current loop dynamics imposes a limitation on how much the poles can be shifted to the left without jeopardizing the system’s stability. To overcome this issue, a lead filter is designed to recover the system phase at the crossover frequency. When designing the Pole Placement Controller (PPC) and the lead filter concurrently, the objective is to minimize the load side disturbance response against the disturbances. This controller is also tested in high-speed tracking and cutting experiments. The third control method is developed around the idea of using the pole placement technique for active damping of not only the first mode of vibration, but also the second and third modes as well. A Kalman filter is designed to estimate a state vector for the system, from the control input and the position measurements obtained from the rotary and linear encoders. The state estimates are then fed back to the PPC controller. Although for this control design, promising results in terms of disturbance rejection are obtained in simulations, the Nyquist stability analysis shows that the closed loop system has poor stability margins. To improve the stability margins, the McFarlane-Glover robustness optimization method is attempted, and as a result, the stability margins are improved, but at the cost of degraded performance. The practical implementation of the third controller, was, unfortunately, not successful. This thesis concludes by addressing the problem of harmonic disturbance rejection in ball screw drives. It is shown that for cases where a <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> is subject to high-frequency disturbances, the dynamic positioning accuracy of the <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> can be improved significantly by adopting an additional control scheme known as Adaptive Feedforward Cancellation (AFC).

In addition, accurate modeling of feed drive systems is essential in elimination of these positioning errors.

40|$|Today's {{economic}} {{demands in}} manufacturing drive {{the requirements for}} high precision and productivity rates in machine tools design. One {{of the most common}} used machine tool drives for linear motion is the <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> (BSD), which converts rotational motion of the servo motor to linear motion of the machine tool structural component. The advantages of modern BSD are high rigidity and low friction, and therefore a high efficiency compared to alternative systems like rack and pinion systems. However, to achieve the required accuracy it is necessary to preload the <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> to prevent backlash. Backlash is caused by the clearance between the contacts of the ball bearings and the threads of the nut and screw. Clearance, however, is needed to prevent unnecessary friction during operation of the BSD. Different preload levels, on one hand, determine the rigidity and thus the maximum load a drive can carry and, on the other hand, the amount of heat to be dissipated due to friction which also leads to wear of the components. Due to their high specific workloads and relatively small spatial requirements, shape memory alloys (SMA) possess an outstanding potential to serve as miniaturized positioning devices in adaptronic and mechatronic applications. In comparison to other actuators such as hydraulics, electric motors or piezoelectric actuators, SMA based-actuators have the highest mechanical work output per volume. Nevertheless, most of the known SMA drives are used in the application area of small and lightweight actuators such as flaps and locks in the automotive industry, medical technology and life science. In this paper we present an approach to retrieve a preload loss which causes a loss to positioning accuracy in BSD due to wear over lifetime. The main purposes are reduced maintenance, longer service life and improved workpiece quality by regenerating previous preload conditions which leads to higher gainings for manufacturers. For this purpose, a novel SMA actuator driven module for BSD has been designed. The device was developed to be implemented in standard drives without major changes in component design. It is installed between flanged nut and counter nut and replaces a spacer usually used to define a specific preload. It was required to scale the actuator module over a wide range of screw diameters respectively nut diameters. Besides mechanical properties, thermal boundary conditions during operation of BSD must be taken into consideration.

The {{utilization}} of spectral {{analysis for the}} purpose of investigating machining parameters in frequency domain has been widely practiced by group of researchers in engineering field. In this case the machining parameters involved are the cutting force parameter.

This paper is paying attention on the essential aspect on how to analyze the cutting forces data appropriately. It is recommended that those data need to be transformed first from the original form of cutting force data in time domain into the form of cutting force data in frequency domain. The outcome from this paper is in the form of graphical representation of cutting force data in frequency domain. It is obtained by applying Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique. To be more clear-cut, the result from this research work shows that the cutting force is directly proportional to the depth of cut and inversely proportional to the spindle speed of the end mill machine.

40|$|Industrial {{demands for}} higher {{productivity}} rates and more stringent part tolerances require faster production machines that can produce, assemble, or manipulate parts at higher speeds and with better accuracy than ever before. In {{a majority of}} production machines, such as machine tools, ball screw drives are used as the primary motion delivery mechanism due to their reasonably high accuracy, high mechanical stiffness, and low cost. This brings the motivation for the research in this thesis, which has been to develop new control techniques that can achieve high bandwidths near the structural frequencies of ball screw drives, and also compensate for various imperfections in their motion delivery, so that better tool positioning accuracy can be achieved at high speeds. A precision <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> has been designed and built for this study. Detailed dynamic modeling and identification has been performed, considering rigid body dynamics, nonlinear friction, torque ripples, axial and torsional vibrations, lead errors, and elastic deformations. Adaptive Sliding Mode Controller (ASMC) is designed based on the rigid body dynamics and notch filters are used to attenuate the effect of structural resonances. Feedforward friction compensation is also added to improve the tracking accuracy at velocity reversals. A bandwidth of 223 Hz was achieved while controlling the rotational motion of the ball screw, leading to a servo error equivalent to 1. 6 um of translational motion. The motor and mechanical torque ripples were also modeled and compensated in the control law. This improved the motion smoothness and accuracy, especially at low speeds and low control bandwidths. The performance improvement was also noticeable when higher speeds and control bandwidths were used. By adding on the torque ripple compensation, the rotational tracking accuracy was improved to 0. 95 um while executing feed motions with 1 m/sec velocity and 1 g acceleration. As {{one of the main}} contributions in this thesis, the dynamics of the 1 st axial mode (at 132 Hz) were actively compensated using ASMC, which resulted in a command tracking bandwidth of 208 Hz. The mode compensating ASMC (MC-ASMC) was also shown to improve the dynamic stiffness of the drive system, around the axial resonance, by injecting additional damping at this mode. After compensating for the lead errors as well, a translational tracking accuracy of 2. 6 um was realized while executing 1 m/sec feed motions with 0. 5 g acceleration transients. In terms of bandwidth, speed, and accuracy, these results surpass the performance of most ball screw driven machine tools by 4 - 5 times. As the second main contribution in this thesis, the elastic deformations (ED) of the <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> were modeled and compensated using a robust strategy. The robustness originates from using the real-time feedback control signal to monitor the effect of any potential perturbations on the load side, such as mass variations or cutting forces, which can lead to additional elastic deformations. In experimental results, it is shown that this compensation scheme can accurately estimate and correct for the elastic deformation, even when there is 130 % variation in the translating table mass. The ED compensation strategy has resulted in 4. 1 um of translational accuracy while executing at 1 m/sec feed motion with 0. 5 g acceleration transients, without using a linear encoder. This result is especially significant for low-cost CNC (Computer Numerically Controlled) machine tools that have only rotary encoders on their motors. Such machines can benefit from the significant accuracy improvement provided by this compensation scheme, without the need for an additional linear encoder...|$|E

Therefore, thermal errors in machine tools are currently an issue to overcome. Within the scope of this work, shape memory alloys have been integrated in <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> <b>drives</b> in order to achieve a thermal stable machine transmission component...|$|R

Additional piezo-based components in drive trains can significantly improve the dynamic behaviour of machine tools. In this article we present a piezo-based actuator-sensor-unit that is able to reduce uniaxial vibrations in <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> <b>driven</b> feed axis of machine tools. Using this component yielded in an increase of the drives controller parameters by more than 100 %. Beyond this piezo-based-components also possess {{to increase the}} accuracy during milling operations and even allow additional fine positioning movements during machining operations. In this paper we present an adaptive spindle as an example to benefit both. This is achieved by an overlaid piezo-based hexapod-kinematics that is mounted between the machine structure and the motor spindle. Shape Memory Alloys and Phase Change Materials represent another group of active materials that are usable to increase accuracy and dynamics. Concerning thermal machine behaviour they are suitable to compensate thermal deformations. Compared to piezo-based solutions they rather don't need additional energy because the activation energy is supplied by the process...|$|R

F (Degree-Of-Freedom) {{lumped parameter model}} was proposed in order to analyze vibrations of a <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> feed-drive system, which takes planar motion. The equations of motion were derived for the proposed model. Natural frequencies {{of the system and}} transient responses due to driving motor speed control input were also analyzed. Experimental modal analysis and operational vibration measurements of a laboratory <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> feed <b>drive</b> system were made. Both theoretical analysis and experimental measurement results showed good agreement with each other. Consequently we concluded that the proposed 6 D. O. F model could be well applicable to the vibration analysis of a <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> feed-drive system...|$|R
