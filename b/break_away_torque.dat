40|$|Tutorialpg. 179 - 194 The {{basics of}} {{tilting pad bearing}} design are {{discussed}} to include limits of operation for load, speed, and metal temperature. Optimum temperature sensor locations are recommended for self-aligning and nonaligning tilting pads. Tilting pad bearing geometric properties and their influence on bearing and rotordynamics are addressed including {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of zero preloaded pads. Also, the advantages of increasing the pad axial length are shown. Example calculations are presented for the tilting pad pivot film thickness which is necessary to determine if the top pads are loaded or unloaded. Tilting pad static shaft sink and clearance measurement techniques are addressed. The equations to calculate normal force and <b>break</b> <b>away</b> <b>torque</b> are derived including an example calculation comparing a tilting pad bearing to a two axial groove bearing. Tilting pad bearing oil flow and temperature rise are included along with a discussion of reduced temperature tilting pad designs...|$|E

When the price is <b>breaking</b> <b>away</b> from a {{triangle}} (Ascending or Descending) with a gap then it can be implied that change in sentiment is strong and coming move will be powerful. One must {{keep an eye on}} the volume. If it is heavy after the gap is formed then there is a good chance that market does not return to fill the gap. When the price is <b>breaking</b> <b>away</b> on a low volume, there is a possibility that the gap will be filled before prices resume their trend.|$|R

50|$|<b>Break</b> <b>Away</b> is a {{national}} nonprofit organization that promotes the development of quality alternative break programs through training, assisting, and connecting campuses and communities. The organization has chapters on about 200 college campuses throughout the United States. <b>Break</b> <b>Away</b> holds training sessions for directors at each chapter school, who then train the student leaders and participants. An alternative break consists {{of a group of}} college students who serve a community with a focus on a specific social issue for a specific amount of time, whether it is a weekend or a week. Most trips are weeklong trips, with the majority over college spring breaks. 60% of trips occur over spring breaks and 15% occur over winter breaks. The social issue pertains to the community to which the group goes. <b>Break</b> <b>Away</b> emphasizes service-learning in which group members learn about the community they will be serving and how to avoid voluntourism. <b>Break</b> <b>Away</b> encourages student leaders, with each trip consisting of student leaders, student participants, a partner organization, and most of the time, a learning partner. By emphasizing the Active Citizenship Continuum and the Eight Components of a Quality Alternative <b>Break,</b> <b>Break</b> <b>Away</b> hopes to produce valuable alternative breaks, which will then lead participants to become more aware and active in their community. <b>Break</b> <b>Away</b> has about 200 chapter schools, more than 500 nonprofit partnerships, and thousands of participants and alumni worldwide. Just in 2014, there were a total of 1,551 trips with over 20,000 participants, which equates to over 1 million hours of service. Of the 1,551 trips in 2014, 1,334 were domestic and 251 were international.|$|R
