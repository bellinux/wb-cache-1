Such a wiring design would not only be complex, {{it would have to}} be altered depending on which modules were included in the specific vehicle. For example, a car without the anti-lock <b>brake</b> <b>module</b> would have to be wired differently than one that included anti-lock brakes.|$|E

Wind power system has some characters of simple structure, convenient maintenance and easy management, which gets a lot of attention.

40|$|The {{development}} and validation of a high-fidelity dynamic model {{of an electric}} sport utility vehicle (SUV) is presented. The developed model of the electric vehicle system consists of two main subsystems: the high-fidelity vehicle dynamics model, and the high-fidelity electrical powertrain subsystem that is comprised of an alternating-current (AC) electric motor, a 3 -phase inverter, and motor controllers. The high-fidelity models are developed in MapleSim and Simulink. Specifically, the high-fidelity vehicle dynamics model is developed using the MapleSim multibody and tire dynamics libraries. A simple longitudinal model is developed in Simulink to cross-validate the high-fidelity MapleSim model by comparing the vehicle dynamics responses of the two models. The electrical powertrain components are developed and implemented in the following order: the AC electric motor is developed first followed by the 3 -phase voltage source inverter. Motor controllers are developed next, and lastly the electrical powertrain subsystem is assembled by combining the AC electric motor, the 3 -phase inverter, and the motor controllers. Previous research results and literature on AC electric motors are studied thoroughly to develop an AC electric motor model suitable for electric vehicle applications. The 3 -phase voltage source inverter is developed to convert a constant voltage signal into 3 -phase AC voltage signals that are used by the AC electric motor. Lastly, the motor controllers are designed to control the electric motor responses, such as developed motor torque or speed. At each stage of the powertrain component model developments, the developed models are verified by studying their simulation results. Experimental motor data from vehicle testing is available, so the experimental torque-speed curves are used to tune the AC electric motor parameters. Once all the individual components are developed and validated, the high-fidelity electric vehicle system is created in Simulink by assembling the MapleSim vehicle dynamics model and the electrical powertrain subsystem which is developed in Simulink. For the models developed in MapleSim, they are exported as Simulink blocks {{so that they could}} be run alongside with the Simulink models. A driver controller is included to calculate required reference motor torque to track a reference speed input. A <b>brake</b> <b>module</b> is designed to simulate a brake system found in an electric vehicle where regenerative and mechanical brake systems cooperate to deliver braking torque. The electric vehicle system model is simulated using the driving cycles that represent city, highway, and aggressive driving scenarios. The simulation results, such as the vehicle's longitudinal speed and developed motor torque and currents, are presented and studied to verify that the electric vehicle system can operate under different driving scenarios...|$|E

50|$|A DC {{injection}} {{brake system}} {{can be used as}} an alternative to a friction brake system. DC injection brakes only require a small module located with the other motor switchgear and/or drivers, mounted in a remote and convenient location, whereas a friction brake must be mounted somewhere on the rotating system. Friction brakes eventually wear out with use and require replacement of braking components. DC <b>brake</b> <b>modules</b> do not have consumable parts and should not require maintenance. Friction brakes also require a method of actuation, requiring either a human operator or system controlled actuator, adding to the complexity of the system. A DC brake is easily integrated into the motor control circuitry.|$|R

40|$|<b>Brake</b> Control <b>Module</b> (BCM) {{tuning in}} terms of the Antilock Braking system (ABS) and the Dynamic Stability Traction Control (DSTC) is {{normally}} a time consuming and costly procedure since it involves comprehensive physical testing on the prototype vehicles in early phases of the vehicle development. To reduce prototype vehicles and make the procedure time efficient, it is envisioned that BCM tuning will be achieved using Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) in all future V 54 X cars at Volvo Car Corporation. The thesis work aims to facilitate method development for Virtual Brake Software Release which constitutes BCM tuning using CAE tools in a closed loop control environment using Global Optimization tools. The CAE environment demands a high correlation between the simulated model (plant) and the actual vehicle. For the preparation of this plant model, tire parameter optimization using global optimization tools is performed using data from physical tests carried out on the test track to achieve good correlation between virtual and physical tests. These maneuvers are reproduced on IPG CarMaker to optimize the tire parameters in the pure slip region. Subsequently, the identification of a reference model was carried out using a 2 DOF model to tune with respect to the plant. The latter part of the thesis discusses various simplified DSTC strategies and a framework to perform the <b>Brake</b> Control <b>Module</b> tuning. It is realized that CAE tuning {{in terms of}} <b>Brake</b> Control <b>Module</b> is possible with an appropriate vehicle model in the CAE environment. As a future scope, sophisticated BCM model could be tuned using CAE tool; however, the constraints set up and weighting factors in the optimization would determine the final tuned values...|$|R

40|$|Abstract‚ÄîIn {{this work}} a dynamic control {{allocation}} approach is presented for an automotive vehicle yaw stabilization scheme. The stabilization strategy {{consists of a}} high level module that deals with the vehicle motion control objective (yaw rate reference generation and tracking), a low level module that handles the braking control for each wheel (longitudinal slip control and maximal tire-road friction parameter estimation) and an intermediate level dynamic control allocation module that generates the longitudinal slip reference for the low level <b>brake</b> control <b>module</b> and commands front wheel steering angle corrections. The control allocation design is such that the actual torque about the yaw axis tends to the desired torque calculated form the high level module, with desirable distribution of control forces satisfying actuator constraints and minimal control effort objectives. Conditions for uniform asymptotic stability are given for the case when the control allocation includes adaptation of the tire-road maximal friction coefficients, and the scheme has been implemented in a realistic non linear multi body vehicle simulation environment. The simulation cases show that the yaw control allocation strategy stabilizes the vehicle in extreme maneuvers where the non linear vehicle yaw dynamics otherwise (without active braking or active steering) becomes unstable {{in the sense of}} over- or under steering. The control allocation implementation is efficient and suitable for low cost automotive electronic control units. I...|$|R
