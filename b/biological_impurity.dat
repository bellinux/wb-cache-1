40|$|The darkening {{effects of}} <b>biological</b> <b>impurities</b> on {{ice and snow}} have been {{recognised}} as a control on the surface energy balance of terrestrial snow, sea ice, glaciers and ice sheets. With a heightened interest in understanding the impacts of a changing climate on snow and ice processes, quantifying the impact of <b>biological</b> <b>impurities</b> on ice and snow albedo (bioalbedo) and its evolution through time is a rapidly growing field of research. However, rigorous quantification of bioalbedo has remained elusive because of difficulties in isolating the biological contribution to ice albedo from that of inorganic impurities and the variable optical properties of the ice itself. For this reason, isolation of the biological signature in reflectance data obtained from aerial/orbital platforms has not been achieved, even when ground-based biological measurements have been available. This paper provides the cell-specific optical properties that are required to model the spectral signatures and broadband darkening of ice. Applying radiative transfer theory, these properties provide the physical basis needed to link biological and glaciological ground measurements with remotely sensed reflectance data. Using these new capabilities we confirm that <b>biological</b> <b>impurities</b> can influence ice albedo, then we identify 10 challenges to the measurement of bioalbedo in the field {{with the aim of}} improving future experimental designs to better quantify bioalbedo feedbacks. These challenges are (1)  ambiguity in terminology, (2)  characterising snow or ice optical properties, (3)  characterising solar irradiance, (4)  determining optical properties of cells, (5)  measuring biomass, (6)  characterising vertical distribution of cells, (7)  characterising abiotic impurities, (8)  surface anisotropy, (9)  measuring indirect albedo feedbacks, and (10)  measurement and instrument configurations. This paper aims to provide a broad audience of glaciologists and biologists with an overview of radiative transfer and albedo that could support future experimental design...|$|R

This result suggested that the novel properties of polywater were due to contamination from <b>biological</b> <b>impurities,</b> and later described the proposal of polywater as an example of Pathological science. He is also a pioneer in using Resonance Raman spectroscopy to study heme proteins, notably hemoglobin, Cytochrome c oxidase, Nitric oxide synthase, and the folding of cytochrome c.|$|R
40|$|Classically all {{vaccines}} {{were produced}} using live or attenuated microorganisms {{or parts of}} them. However, the use of whole organisms, their components or the biological process for vaccine production has several weaknesses. The presence of immunologically redundant biological components or <b>biological</b> <b>impurities</b> in such vaccines might cause major problems. All the disadvantageous of traditional vaccines might be overcome via the development of fully synthetic peptide-based vaccines. However, once minimal antigenic epitopes only are applied for immunisation, the immune responses are poor. The use of an adjuvant can overcome this obstacle; however, it may raise new glitches. Here we briefly summarise the current stand on peptide-based vaccines, discuss epitope and adjuvant design, and multi-epitope and nanoparticle-based vaccine approaches. This mini review discusses also the disadvantages and benefits associated with peptide-based vaccines. It proposes possible methods to overcome the weaknesses of the synthetic vaccine strategy and suggests future directions for its development...|$|R
30|$|Preliminary {{characterization}} of gold nanoparticles {{was carried out}} using UV–vis spectroscopy (Tecan plate reader-infinite m 200 model). Gold nanoparticle powder sample was prepared by centrifuging the synthesized gold nanoparticle solution at 10, 000  rpm for 15  min for Fourier transformed infrared radiation spectroscopy measurement. The solid residue layer which contains gold nanoparticles was dispersed in sterile deionised water three times to remove the attached <b>biological</b> <b>impurities.</b> The pure residue was then dried in an oven overnight at 65 °C. The obtained powder was subjected to FT-IR measurement carried out on a Perkin Elmer spectrum-one instrument at a resolution of 4  cm− 1 in KBr pellets. Transmission electron microscopy measurement of synthesized gold nanoparticles using Hibiscus rosa-sinensis leaf extract were carried out on Techni- 20 Philips transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kev. TEM sample were prepared by the dispersion of 2 – 3 drops of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis stabilized gold nanoparticle solution on a copper grid and dried at room temperature after the removal of excess solution with filter paper.|$|R

This research was performed through test fields, with the objective of evaluating the performance of a disc filter (130 microns) and a non woven synthetic fabric filter on the removal of physical, chemical and <b>biological</b> <b>impurities</b> from the irrigation water, which may cause emitter obstruction during fertirrigation processes. The evaluation criteria of the impurities present in the irrigation water, were based on studies performed on trickle irrigation systems.

40|$|AbstractFollowing {{a release}} of Bacillus anthracis spores into the environment, there is a {{potential}} for lasting environmental contamination in soils. There is a need for detection protocols for B. anthracis in environmental matrices. However, identification of B. anthracis within a soil is a difficult task. Processing soil samples helps to remove debris, chemical components, and <b>biological</b> <b>impurities</b> that can interfere with microbiological detection. This study aimed to optimize a previously used indirect processing protocol, which included a series of washing and centrifugation steps. Optimization of the protocol included: identifying an ideal extraction diluent, variation in the number of wash steps, variation in the initial centrifugation speed, sonication and shaking mechanisms. The optimized protocol was demonstrated at two laboratories in order to evaluate the recovery of spores from loamy and sandy soils. The new protocol demonstrated an improved limit of detection for loamy and sandy soils over the non-optimized protocol with an approximate matrix limit of detection at 14 spores/g of soil. There were no significant differences overall between the two laboratories for either soil type, suggesting that the processing protocol will be robust enough to use at multiple laboratories while achieving comparable recoveries...|$|R

40|$|The {{contamination}} {{of air and}} water {{is one of the}} major concerns towards the development of a sustainable world in the 21 st century. In this context many efforts are devoted to the design of photocatalytic paints able to degrade chemical and <b>biological</b> <b>impurities</b> present in air and water. In this work, the photocatalytic activity of hybrid films formed from the blends of pure acrylic or core/shell fluorinated/acrylic waterborne dispersions and photocatalytic titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanoparticle dispersions was first assessed. The films show photocatalytic activity (inactivation of the Escherichia coli bacteria under UV irradiation) at the substrate-film interface, but very reduced activity in the air-film interface due to the substantially lower amount of the TiO 2 nanoparticles in the vicinity of this interface. In a second step, the fluorinated/(meth) acrylic core-shell hybrid dispersions were used as binders in the formulation of waterborne photocatalytic paints and the stability of the paints, in terms of gloss retain and color change, was assessed during 5000 hours of accelerated weathering tests (QUV-B). Although a decrease in gloss retention and increased color change occurs during the first 1000 hours of exposure, no further change of these properties takes place, which is an excellent indication of stable photocatalytic paints...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of exploiting carbon nanotubes (CNT) in biomedical practices requires thorough {{analysis of the}} chemical or bulk effects they may exert on the immune system, the complex network that recognizes and eliminates foreign particles. In particular, the phagocytosing ability of cells belonging to the monocyte/macrophage lineage may render these immune cells an ideal toxicological target of pristine CNT, which may form aggregates of size exceeding monocyte/macrophage phagocytosing plasticity. To shed light on this issue, we analyzed the effects that pristine multi-walled CNT (MWCNT) without metal or <b>biological</b> <b>impurities</b> exert on survival and activation of freshly explanted human peripheral blood monocytes, analyzing in parallel the non-phagocytosing lymphocytes, and using graphite as control carbon material. MWCNT (diameter 10 - 50 nm, length up to 10 μm) exert two different toxic effects on mononuclear leukocytes: a minor apoptogenic effect (on lymphocytes > monocytes), and a major, apoptosis-independent effect that exclusively and deeply affect monocyte homeostasis. Analysis of monocyte number, adhesion, redox equilibrium, and the differentiation markers CD 14 and CD 11 b reveals that MWCNT cause the selective disappearance of phagocytosis-competent monocytes by mechanisms related {{to the presence of}} large nanoparticle aggregates, suggesting phenomena of bulk toxicity possibly consisting of frustrated phagocytosis. At the same time, MWCNT stimulate adhesion of the phagocytosis-incompetent monocytes, and their differentiation toward a peculiar maturation asset. These observations point out novel mechanisms of CNT toxicity, renewing concerns that they may impair the innate immune system deranging the inflammatory responses. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} {{is to create a}} nanostructured {{microelectrode}} pH sensor to measure the pH of brain fluids. This work will describe the fabrication, characterization and development of the nanostructured Pd electrodes and their assessment for use as pH sensors in the brain fluid. The palladium hydride ?+? transition is located between the ? and ? phases where H/Pd atomic ratios range between 0. 02 and 0. 6. This region was selected to fabricate the pH sensor because its potential (Epd-H) is stable and independent of the hydrogen– palladium composition. In addition, Epd-H follows a linear relationship with pH. A nanostructured Pd film was chosen to fabricate the pH sensor in order to obtain a large electroactive area because Epd-H is not stable with microelectrode; a large area is needed to reach the equilibrium between palladium and hydrogen. Also, neurobiological pH measurements require a small sensor {{as a result of the}} limited biological sample quantities available. The nanostructured pH sensor H 1 -e Pd was made by liquid crystal templating method (LCT). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical characterisation were used to estimate the radius a and electroactive area of the nanostructured Pd film after the deposition process. The ?+? transition was prepared by loading hydrogen electrochemically before the experiments were carried out. The nanostructured Pd hydride electrode was then used to estimate the pH in different solutions including artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) and real brain fluid. The results obtained demonstrate the applicability of such electrodes to function as pH sensors in brain fluid. The biomedical applications requires high efficiency that can be affected by the biological samples contaminations onto the electrode. Thus, attempts were made to develop the H 1 -e Pd pH sensors performance by covering their surface with coats to stop the <b>biological</b> <b>impurities...</b>|$|R

Kearny asserts, based on field testing, that air filtration is not normally needed in a nuclear shelter. He asserts that fallout is either large enough to fall to the ground, or so fine that it will not settle and thus has little bulk to emit radiation. However, if possible, shelters should have air-filtration to stop chemical, <b>biological</b> and nuclear <b>impurities</b> which may abound after an explosion.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Currently many {{different}} types of protective garments are used designed to protect the wearer against biological contamination (e. g., bacteria) and mechanical impurities (such as dust, drops of technical fluids, etc.). Their disadvantage is that, thanks to the materials used in the requirement of a high level of protection for the user, a very low permeability even to zero, so that for example, do not allow to remove moisture and heat from the user's body and thus their use is quite uncomfortable, and conversely, in case of the requirement of good breathability and high comfort of application have very little effectiveness in detecting <b>biological</b> and mechanical <b>impurities,</b> which is not sufficient for a number of disciplines...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} gene therapy {{involves}} {{the transfer of}} genetic material into a human cell, tissue or organ {{with the objective of}} either curing a disease or decreasing the progression of the disease. With the increasing use of plasmid DNA (pDNA) vector vehicles for the delivery of this genetic material, it becomes appropriate to investigate the potential environmental effects of the waste streams discharged from the possible industrial scale manufacture of pDNA. These waste streams can contain <b>biological</b> <b>impurities</b> such as proteins, genomic DNA and endotoxin as well as chemical components such as buffer constituents and unutilised nutrients. Specifically, phosphorus and nitrogen emissions from upstream processing were assessed {{in order to determine the}} extent of their use by Escherichia coli (E. coli) during fermentation. The results indicated the spent media waste exhibited only a minor reduction of these nutrient concentrations, indicating minimal uptake of phosphorus and nitrogen by the microorganisms in the fermentation process. The unutilised excess level of phosphorus and nitrogen within the waste streams generated suggested a strong potential for environmental impact in the form of eutrophication. In this regard, waste minimisation studies were undertaken on terrific broth with the aim of reducing unnecessary phosphorus and nitrogen inputs without adversely affecting bacterial growth or plasmid production levels. The results indicated that added phosphorus in the media can be reduced by 98 % without significantly affecting the quantity or quality of pDNA produced. However, it was found that the nitrogen content of the media could not be significantly reduced without adversely affecting pDNA yields. The compositions of a number of waste streams generated from the downstream processing of pDNA were established. Mass balances for each of the pollutants investigated (total phosphorus, total kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonia and nitrate) were constructed using SuperPro Designer® 6. 0. Process improvements were established by employing the optimised media at bench and projected large scale. The findings from this research were subsequently modelled to evaluate the possible environmental impacts from the pDNA process. The modelling focus was based upon the equivalency potential approach which was used to classify environmental impacts. The model derives a single environmental score which permits identification of the most environmentally adverse emission streams and allows comparison of the efficacy of different waste minimisation strategies. A user-friendly and relatively flexible computer simulation model was also developed to maximise clarity, ease of use and functionality for application of the model. Due to the recombinant nature of pDNA vectors for application in gene therapy, consideration was given to the possible accidental release of such recombinant plasmids from production facilities into the environment. Thermal and enzymatic treatments of pDNA containing waste product streams were evaluated in terms of their suitability for pDNA degradation. Both methods were successful in degrading pDNA in all four waste streams to fragments less than 200 bp in size thus preventing the threat of horizontal gene transfer. Optimisation studies were subsequently undertaken to determine the minimum concentration of nuclease required for pDNA degradation in each of the waste streams...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a brief overview}} of the application of biological effluent with microirrigation systems. In this paper, biological effluent is considered to be water that contains <b>impurities</b> derived from <b>biological</b> sources. Such <b>impurities</b> include human and animal metabolic wastes and domestic and industrial food processing wastes. There are many potential advantages to applying biological effluent with microirrigation systems, especially drip irrigation systems. Advantages include (Gushiken, 1995; Trooien et al., 2000) : • Overspray and drift are minimized so liability exposure is minimized, • Potable water resources are conserved, • Pressure requirements are often reduced, • Unusual field shapes and sizes are easier to irrigate in their entirety, • Nutrients in the effluent can be utilized by the crop, • Irrigation system corrosion is reduced because most of the system is made of plastic, and • Cost/benefit compares favorably to other methods in some situations. Additional potential benefits can be realized when using subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) system...|$|R
40|$|Essential oil {{extracted}} from Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (H. cordata) {{is widely used}} in traditional Chinese medicine due to its excellent <b>biological</b> activities. However, <b>impurities</b> and deficient preparations of the essential oil limit its safety and effectiveness. Herein, we proposed a strategy to prepare H. cordata essential oil (HEO) safely and effectively by combining the solvent extraction and the macroporous resin purification flexibly, and then encapsulating it using microemulsion. The extraction and purification process were optimized by orthogonal experimental design and adsorption-desorption tests, respectively. The average houttuynin content in pure HEO was then validated at 44. 3 % ± 2. 01 %, which presented a great potential for industrial application. Subsequently, pure HEO-loaded microemulsion was prepared by high-pressure homogenization and was then fully characterized. Results showed that the pure HEO-loaded microemulsion was successfully prepared with an average particle size of 179. 1 nm and a high encapsulation rate of 94. 7 %. Furthermore, safety evaluation tests and in vitro antiviral testing indicated that the safety and activity of HEO were significantly improved after purification using D 101 resin and were further improved by microemulsion encapsulation. These results demonstrated that the purification of HEO by macroporous resin followed by microemulsion encapsulation would be a promising approach for industrial application of HEO for the antiviral therapies...|$|R
40|$|Herbal {{medicines}} {{are traditionally}} considered natural and therefore safe products, but their increased consumption also increases the potential risk of interactions with conventional medicines and adverse reactions. Adverse reactions of herbal medicinal products may also occur {{because of the}} innate herbal toxicity, <b>biological</b> or chemical <b>impurity</b> of the raw herb, misrecognition and substitution with toxic herbal species or counterfeiting using cheaper substances or undeclared synthetic pharmacologically active substances. Numerous interactions of herbal and conventional medicines have been recorded, but {{for many of them}} the exact underlying pharmacological mechanisms have not been studied well nor has their clinical significance been established. Some of the better-known interactions are the ones in which the herbal medicine, such as St. John’s wort, induces the hepatic enzyme CYP system responsible for metabolic transformation of many drugs, and therefore causing potentially serious and clinically relevant adverse reactions. For example, this type of interaction between St. John’s wort and an immunosuppressant can lead to a decrease in the mass fraction of the immunosuppressant with consequent transplant rejection. For many of the widely used herbal medicinal products, e. g. Ginkgo, possible interactionscan be expected based on published case reports. An example of a recommendation derived from case reports is the one by which the concomitant administration of Ginkgo and anticoagulant drugs (acetylsalicylic acid, warfarin) should be avoided due to increased risk of bleeding. For {{a relatively small number of}} herbal medicinal products the active principles and mechanisms of action are known and can therefore be used to predict possible interactions with other medicines. For example, hydroxyanthracene derivatives of Senna, along with other effects, can cause electrolyte excretion that can lead to toxic effect of cardiac glycosides, antiarithmics and potassium depleting drugs (e. g. non-potassium sparing diuretics). In the conditions of the ever-increasing consumption of herbal medicines, it is necessary to increase the level of consciousness and knowledge of interactions between herbal and conventional medicines in order to minimize the risk of interactions and consequential development of adverse reactions. In addition, it is of great importance to report all suspected adverse reactions to herbal medicinal products, as well as interactions and ineffectiveness, to the competent authority in order to contribute to the better understanding of the effectiveness and safety profile of a particular herbal medicinal product...|$|R
