25|$|The {{abutments}} {{of modern}} London Bridge rest several metres above natural embankments of gravel, sand and clay. From the late Neolithic era the southern embankment formed a natural causeway above the surrounding swamp and marsh of the river's estuary; the northern ascended to higher {{ground at the}} present site of Cornhill. Between the embankments, the River Thames could have been crossed by ford when the tide was low, or ferry when it was high. Both embankments, particularly the northern, would have offered stable <b>backheads</b> for boat traffic up and downstream â€“ the Thames and its estuary were a major inland and Continental trade route from at least the 9th century BC. There is archaeological evidence for scattered Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age settlement nearby, but until a bridge was built there, London did not exist. Two ancient fords were in use a few miles upstream, beyond the river's upper tidal reach. It seems that the course of Watling Street was aligned with them and led into the heartlands of the Catuvellauni, {{who at the time}} of Caesar's invasion of 54 BC were Britain's most powerful tribe. Some time before Claudius's conquest of AD 43, power shifted to the Trinovantes, who held the region northeast of the Thames Estuary from a capital at Camulodunum, nowadays Colchester in Essex. Claudius imposed a major colonia on Camulodunum, and made it the capital city of the new Roman province of Britannia. The first London Bridge was built by the Romans as part of their road-building programme, to help consolidate their conquest.|$|R

50|$|By {{the late}} 1870s {{there was a}} {{distinct}} need for a powerful type of locomotive to operate the steep section of the Main South Line between Dunedin and Oamaru. As {{the success of the}} K class demonstrated the suitability of American locomotives to New Zealand's railways, an order was placed with the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1879 for six 2-8-0 tender locomotives. Based on a design already used for the Denver and Rio Grande, it was much less decorative than the K class, but this did not detract from its performance capabilities. The largest and most powerful locomotives in the country upon their introduction, the <b>backhead</b> of the boiler protruded a very long way into the cab leaving very little room for the driver or fireman.|$|E
50|$|Like the W class 2-8-0 Consolidation, {{there was}} no cab deck behind the <b>backhead,</b> the fireman shoveled coal from the tender deck and, along with the engineer, sat beside the firebox because the firebox came right {{to the back of}} the cab. The {{throttle}} lever hung down over the shoulder of the firebox, the reverser lever was in front of the engineer against the side of the firebox, with the water glass just above. The injector controls (A water valve, the overflow valve, and the operating lever.) were in front of him against the outer wall of the cab. Although slightly cramped, visibility to the front was superb. On the fireman's side, there was a water glass, injector controls, and a drop seat arranged like the engineer's.|$|E
5000|$|The Leader had a [...] "dry lining" [...] firebox. It was not {{surrounded}} on top {{and sides}} by a [...] "jacket" [...] of water as in normal practice, but was constructed of welded steel and used firebricks instead of water for insulation, a novel but troublesome solution. Using firebricks reduced the grate area from 47 ft2 m2 to 25.5 ft2 m2 and concentrated the fire in a smaller area. The firehole door was offset {{to the left of}} the boiler <b>backhead,</b> which created difficulties for the fireman when adding coal to the fire. The firebox was not initially equipped with a firebrick arch, although one was retro-fitted during the summer of 1950.

5000|$|Due {{to their}} smaller size, these engines {{are often used}} by the Durango & Silverton for shorter trains, usually the first or last on the schedule, and also for helper service or {{sectioned}} trains. Despite being slightly smaller, a little older and less powerful than the K-36s, the engine crews tend to favor a trip on these engines because the design ALCO used was superior in balance and servicing. Firing can be tricky when the engine is working hard, as the clamshell-style firedoors tend to pull into the <b>backhead</b> of the boiler due to the draft, and if any flues in the boiler are leaking, the loss of draft on the fire is much harder to work around than on the K-36 locomotives. Firing while the engine is working hard is done with a large [...] "heel" [...] pattern, generally with as little coal on the flue sheet as possible, and gradually sloping the fire bed towards the door sheet to the height or higher than the firedoors. This results in the draft being forced through the fire bed in the thinner areas towards the flue sheet, which usually is hindered {{by the lack of}} draft between the grates and the arch brick. New firemen sometimes have a hard time learning this because there are fewer training hours available on the K-28 class locomotives compared to the railroad's usual K-36 workhorses which have a larger firebox and are more forgiving of poor technique.|$|E
5000|$|In 1932, the Southern Railway {{ordered a}} final batch of 15 {{locomotives}} (Nos. 1400 - 1414) to expand class availability on the Southern Railway's network. These were built at Ashford works and {{differed from the}} previous 65 {{in a number of}} ways. The cabs of the final eight locomotives (Nos. 1407 - 1414) were fitted for left-hand driving, which was adopted as standard by the Southern Railway. The original N class chimney was replaced with the lower-profile version used on the U1 class, which increased route availability by allowing the locomotives to pass under lower bridges and tunnels. Maunsell had begun to research smoke deflection techniques to improve driver visibility on the King Arthur class between 1926 and 1927, which resulted in the adoption of a standard smoke deflector design for the Southern Railway. A smaller version was fitted to Nos. 1400 - 1414 during building. Before entering service, the batch was attached to 4000 imp gal tenders to increase operational range over the Southern Railway's long Western section routes. Despite this advantage, tenders fitted to the eight left-hand drive examples were intended for use with right-hand drive locomotives. This resulted in the location of the fireman's fittings on the [...] "wrong" [...] side of the cab.

5000|$|The 480 series or K-36 class {{locomotives}} {{were ten}} engines {{designed for the}} D&RGW. They were built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1925. The 480s were the last ten narrow-gauge locomotives constructed for the DRGW. The 480s were used for freight-hauling throughout the D&RGW [...] narrow-gauge network. The [...] "36" [...] stands for 36200 lbf kN. of tractive effort. These engines are outside frame Mikados, and all drive wheels have counterbalancing outside of the frame, resulting in the utilitarian look the engines are known for. The engines currently use 6-ET automatic air and the secondary straight air used on regular service equipment. The railroad runs 12-car passenger trains behind these engines; however more cars require the train to be doubleheaded. Despite popular belief that the railroad does not doublehead trains out of Durango because of smoke, the real reason is the weight restriction on the bridge at 15th Street, not allowing more than one K-36 at a time (K-28 class engines however are still doubleheaded from Durango). The engines were delivered with Master Mechanics design smokeboxes for draft, however {{at some point the}} D&RGW converted them to Andersson (cyclone) front ends. Water is fed to the boiler by two non-lifting injectors. The 40 sq ft grate surface in the firebox is among the largest built for a narrow-gauge locomotive, and is fed by hand firing. Firing is simpler on these engines compared to the K-28s, however the larger surface area requires more fuel. A typical trip uses around 3 - 5 ST on the way up to Silverton, and another 1 - 2 ST on the return to Durango. Ergonomically, the engines are less comfortable than the others as well, with the crew seats being further back from the <b>backhead,</b> and the engineer having to lean forward constantly to adjust the throttle and use the sanders. The running gear on the locomotives also tend to wear out faster than the ALCO designed K-28s, and the resulting pounding rough ride can take a toll on the engine crew.|$|E
5000|$|The 470 series or 2-8-2 K-28 class {{locomotives}} {{were ten}} engines designed for freight service along the D&RG. They were {{built by the}} Schenectady Locomotive Works of the American Locomotive Company (Alco) in Schenectady, New York in 1923. The K-28s have 28000 lbf kN. of tractive effort, superheated, and the boilers are fed by two non-lifting injectors. Air brakes are 6-ET automatic and also feature a straight air secondary braking system for daily passenger trains. Due to their smaller size these engines are often used on the Durango & Silverton for shorter trains, usually the first or last on the schedule, and often for helper service or sectioned trains. Despite being smaller than the K-36 class locomotives, older, and less powerful, the engine crews tend to favor a trip on these engines because the design ALCO used was superior in balance and servicing.

New firemen sometimes have a hard time learning this because the art of reading a fire takes time to learn, and the amount of time working on the K-28 class locomotives is far reduced compared to the railroads usual K-36 workhorses which have a larger firebox and are more forgiving in technique.Out of the original ten only three 470s remain, and all are owned by the D & S. The other seven were requisitioned by the United States Army in 1942 to be used on the White Pass & Yukon Route in Alaska during World War II. They were later dismantled for scrap in 1946.|$|E
