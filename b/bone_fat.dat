40|$|<b>Bone</b> marrow <b>fat,</b> an unique {{component}} of the bone marrow cavity increases with aging and menopause and is inversely related to bone mass. Sex steroids {{may be involved in}} the regulation of <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat,</b> because men have higher <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> than women and clinical observations have suggested that the variation in <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> fraction is greater in premenopausal compared to postmenopausal women and men. We hypothesized that the menstrual cycle and/or estrogen affects the <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> fraction. First, we measured vertebral <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> fraction with Dixon Quantitative Chemical Shift MRI (QCSI) twice a week during 1 month in 10 regularly ovulating women. The vertebral <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> fraction increased 0. 02 (95 % CI, 0. 00 to 0. 03) during the follicular phase (p = 0. 033), and showed a nonsignificant decrease of 0. 02 (95 % CI, - 0. 01 to 0. 04) during the luteal phase (p = 0. 091). To determine the effect of estrogen on <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat,</b> we measured vertebral <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> fraction every week for 6 consecutive weeks in 6 postmenopausal women before, during, and after 2 weeks of oral 17 -β estradiol treatment (2 mg/day). <b>Bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> fraction decreased by 0. 05 (95 % CI, 0. 01 to 0. 09) from 0. 48 (95 % CI, 0. 42 to 0. 53) to 0. 43 (95 % CI, 0. 34 to 0. 51) during 17 -β estradiol administration (p < 0. 001) and increased again after cessation. During 17 -β estradiol administration the bone formation marker procollagen type I N propeptide (P 1 NP) increased (p = 0. 034) and the bone resorption marker C-terminal crosslinking telopeptides of collagen type I (CTx) decreased (p < 0. 001). In conclusion, we described the variation in vertebral <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> fraction among ovulating premenopausal women. And among postmenopausal women, we demonstrated that 17 -β estradiol rapidly reduces the marrow fat fraction, suggesting that 17 -β estradiol regulates <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> independent of <b>bone</b> mas...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. An {{increasing}} number of studies are utilizing different magnetic resonance (MR) methods to quantify <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> due to its potential role in osteoporosis. Our aim is to compare the measurements of <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> among T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), modified Dixon method (also called fat fraction MRI (FFMRI)), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Methods. Contiguous MRI scans were acquired in 27 Caucasian postmenopausal women with a modified Dixon method (i. e., FFMRI). Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) of T 1 -weighted MRI and <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> fraction of the L 3 vertebra and femoral necks were quantified using SliceOmatic and Matlab. MRS was also acquired at the L 3 vertebra. Results. Correlation among the three MR methods measured <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> fraction and BMAT ranges from 0. 78 to 0. 88 in the L 3 vertebra. Correlation between BMAT measured by T 1 -weighted MRI and <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> fraction measured by modified FFMRI is 0. 86 in femoral necks. Conclusion. There are good correlations among T 1 -weighted MRI, FFMRI, and MRS for <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> quantification.

40|$|In aging, {{the bone}} marrow fills with fat and this may lead to higher {{fracture}} risk. We show that a <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> measurement by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a newer technique not previously studied in chronic kidney disease (CKD), is useful and reproducible. CKD patients have significantly higher <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> than healthy adults. INTRODUCTION: Renal osteodystrophy leads to increased morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. Traditional bone biopsy histomorphometry is used to study abnormalities in CKD, but {{the bone marrow}}, the source of osteoblasts, has not been well characterized in patients with CKD. METHODS: To determine the repeatability of <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> fraction assessment by MRS and water-fat imaging (WFI) at four sites in patients with CKD, testing was performed to determine the coefficients of reproducibility and intraclass coefficients (ICCs). We further determined if this noninvasive technique {{could be used to}} determine if there are differences in the percent <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> in patients with CKD compared to matched controls using paired t tests. RESULTS: The mean age of subjects with CKD was 59. 8 [*]±[*] 7. 2 years, and the mean eGFR was 24 [*]±[*] 8 ml/min. MRS showed good reproducibility at all sites in subjects with CKD and controls, with a coefficient of reproducibilities ranging from 2. 4 to 13 %. MRS and WFI assessment of <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> showed moderate to strong agreement (ICC 0. 6 - 0. 7) at the lumbar spine, with poorer agreement at the iliac crest and no agreement at the tibia. The mean percent <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> at L 2 -L 4 was 13. 8 % (95 % CI 8. 3 - 19. 7) higher in CKD versus controls (p[*]<[*] 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Intraoperative {{cardiovascular}} deterioration as {{a result}} of pulmonary embolization of <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> is a potentially serious complication during vertebroplasty. The release of fatty material and thromboplastin from the bone marrow cavity during vertebroplasty may activate the coagulation cascade resulting in thrombogenesis, and pharmacological prophylaxis may therefore prevent cardiovascular complications. Thus, the effects of <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> embolism on coagulation activation during vertebroplasty were investigated with use of an animal model. Methods: Polymethylmethacrylate was injected into three lumbar vertebrae of six sheep in order to force <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> into the circulation. Invasive blood pressures and heart rate were recorded continuously until sixty minutes after the last injection. Cardiac output, arterial and mixed venous blood gas parameters, and coagulation parameters were measured at selected time-points. Postmortem lung biopsy specimens were assessed for the presence of intravascular fat. Results: Embolization of <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> resulted in a sudden and dramatic increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure and a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure. There were no significant changes in any coagulation parameter from before the injection to after the injection. Intravascular <b>fat</b> and <b>bone</b> marrow cells were present in all lung lobes. Conclusions: Injection of polymethylmethacrylate into vertebral bodies caused embolization of <b>bone</b> marrow <b>fat</b> with subsequent transient cardiovascular deterioration, but no changes in coagulation parameters were observed.
