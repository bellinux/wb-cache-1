40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} generating a parametric Gn <b>blending</b> <b>surface</b> based on reparameterizing the partial surface patches in the base surfaces {{on the basis of}} Erich Hartmann method. This method is expressed as follows: Firstly, the partial region near contact curves in both base surfaces is reparameterized. The contact curves are used as the boundaries of the reparameterized partial region respectively. The reparameterized partial region in two base surfaces is called the reparameterized local base surfaces. Then the parametric Gn <b>blending</b> <b>surface</b> is generated by a linear combination of the reparameterized local base surface patches depending on one of the common parameters. Therefore, generating a Parametric Gn <b>Blending</b> <b>Surface</b> between two base surfaces is translated into generating a Parametric Gn <b>Blending</b> <b>Surface</b> between the two reparameterized local base surfaces. This paper illustrates the method to generate the Gn <b>blending</b> <b>surface</b> with some constraints by generating a G 2 <b>blending</b> <b>surface</b> between the aerofoil and the body of a missile with the constraints of the forward and rear fringe curves. When the Gn <b>blending</b> <b>surface</b> with some constraints is generated, the partial region near contact curves in both base surfaces is reparameterized, and the scale factors, offset, balance factor and thumb weight are defined by meeting the constraints through using an optimization method. Then the parametric Gn <b>blending</b> <b>surface</b> is generated by the linear combination of the reparameterized local base surface patches. The shape of the <b>blending</b> <b>surface</b> can be adjusted by changing the size of the reparameterized local base surface patches...|$|R

Blending is also considered a natural property of implicit surfaces, where the basic operation is an algebraic sum (or difference) between skeleton-based scalar fields. Blending operations are typically used in computer-aided design for modeling fillets and chamfers.

The ability of an Electric Force Microscope (EFM) to create charge patterns on polymer surfaces was studied in detail. Large dc voltages were applied to a chromium coated cantilever leading to the induction of a charged region on the polymer substrate. The effects of applied voltage, tip-sample separation, scanning speed and deposition area on the resultant deposition pattern were studied. Charging thresholds for different polymer substrates were experimentally determined. A polymer <b>blend</b> <b>surface</b> consisting of nanometer sized islets of conducting polybutadiene within an insulating polystyrene matrix was also produced. The different charge storage properties of these two polymers were exploited in order to produce a nanometer scale charge patterned substrate. Charge patterns were also used as templates for the directed deposition of gold nano-particles. The pulsed plasma deposition of a 4 -vinylpyridine monomer was studied in order to investigate the production of aromatic nitrogen surfaces. The retention of the nitrogen functionality allowed the plasma polymer to act as a seed site for the electroless deposition of both copper and nickel. Patterning was facilitated on a micrometer scale by embossing a grid into the polymer substrate. An investigation into the plasma fluorination of a polymethylmethacrylate yielded surfaces that combined both anti-reflective and super-repellent characteristics.

40|$|The {{properties}} of polystyrene blends containing deuteriopolystyrene, multiply end-functionalized with C 8 F 17 fluorocarbon groups, are strikingly analogous {{to those of}} surfactants in solution. These materials, denoted FxdPSy, where x {{is the number of}} fluorocarbon groups and y is the molecular weight of the dPS chain in kg/mol, were blended with unfunctionalized polystyrene, hPS. Nuclear reaction analysis experiments show that FxdPSy polymers adsorb spontaneously to solution and blend surfaces, resulting in a reduction in surface energy inferred from contact angle analysis. Aggregation of functionalized polymers in the bulk was found to be sensitive to FxdPSy structure and closely related to surface properties. At low concentrations, the functionalized polymers are freely dispersed in the hPS matrix, and in this range, the surface excess concentration grows sharply with increasing bulk concentration. At higher concentrations, surface excess concentrations and contact angles reach a plateau, small-angle neutron scattering data indicate small micellar aggregates of six to seven F 2 dPS 10 polymer chains and much larger aggregates of F 4 dPS 10. Whereas F 2 dPS 10 aggregates are miscible with the hPS matrix, F 4 dPS 10 forms a separate phase of multilamellar vesicles. Using neutron reflectometry (NR), we found that the extent of the adsorbed layer was approximately half the lamellar spacing of the multilamellar vesicles. NR data were fitted using an error function profile to describe the concentration profile of the adsorbed layer, and reasonable agreement was found with concentration profiles predicted by the SCFT model.

The annealed <b>blend</b> <b>surface</b> presented {{an increase in the}} PMMA concentration whereas that of copolymers showed a decrease in PMMA concentration compared with the as-cast sample. For blends, the nano-SIMS as well as AFM images revealed the formation of phase-separated domains at the surface. The composition information obtained from ToF-SIMS and XPS, as well as the surface mapping by nano-SIMS and AFM, allowed us to conclude that PS formed phase separated droplet-like domains on a thin PMMA matrix on annealing. The three-dimensional nano-SIMS images showed that the PS droplets were supported inside a rim of PMMA and that these droplets continued from the surface like columnar rods into the film until the substrate interface. In the case of annealed copolymer samples, the AFM images revealed topographical features resembling droplet-like domains on the surface but there was no phase difference between the domains and the matrix. In the case of copolymers, owing to the covalent bonding between the blocks, complete phase separation was not possible. The three-dimensional nano-SIMS images showed domain structures in the form of striations inside the film, which were not continuous until the substrate interface. Information from the different techniques was required to gain an accurate view of the surface composition and topographical changes that have occurred under the annealing conditions.

40|$|Three {{different}} polymer {{systems were}} studied, 1) {{a blend of}} poly(bisphenol A octane) (BA-C 8) and Poly(4, 4 '(hexfluoroisopropylidene) diphenol octane) (6 FBA-C 8), 2) a copolymer containing both BA-C 8 and 6 FBA-C 8 and 3) the blend of poly (ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC). The {{results showed that the}} segregation mechanisms of the component to the surfaces of above systems are controlled by crystallization. A miscible polymer blend with 80 weight percentage of BA-C 8 and 20 weight percentage of 6 FBA-C 8 was prepared and studied. Using an atomic force microscope (AFM), BA-C 8 was shown to form small spherulites. The surface morphology is {{different from that of the}} pure BA-C 8. The surface composition as a function of time was studied using contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The low surface energy component, 6 FBA-C 8, segregated to the spherulites surface. The segregation of the low surface component in this miscible was driven by crystallization. A copolymer containing 18 units of BA-C 8 and 1 unit of 6 FBA-C 8 was synthesized and studied. The morphology of the copolymer surface, as observed by using AFM, was similar to that of the BA-C 8 except the crystallization rate of the copolymer was slower. However, in this case, ToF-SlMS and XPS results as well as contact angle measurements indicated that. The surface energy of the copolymer increased and the fluorine content decreased as the copolymer crystallized. This unusual phenomenon was caused by the transformation of the polymer chains from random coils to a regular structure (lamellae). The lower surface energy component, 6 FBA-C 8, was pinned to fixed positions in the crystal structure. The surface composition and morphology of a blend of PCL/PVC, which formed banded spherulites under a selected range of temperature and composition, were studied. Ridges and valleys, which were shown to form one the <b>blend</b> <b>surface,</b> were shown by AFM to be edge-on and flat-on, respectively. The ToF 0 SlMS images revealed that the fluorine and oxygen concentrations were higher in the valley and ridge regions, respectively. This positional segregation was caused by the difference in surface energy between edge-on and flat-on lamellae. The surface energy of PVC is higher than that of edge-on lamellae but lower than that of flat-on lamellae. As a result, an alternate ring-type distribution of PVC was observed on the surface of the blend. The above examples clearly show that crystallization is a key driving force that determines the surface composition of blends and copolymers which contain a crystallizable component...|$|E
40|$|We {{survey the}} {{potential}} method for <b>blending</b> implicit algebraic <b>surfaces,</b> summarizing and extending work previously reported. The method {{is capable of}} deriving blends for pairs of algebraic surfaces, and is guaranteed to produce <b>blending</b> <b>surfaces</b> of lowest possible degree for two quadrics in general position. We give two paradigms by which to understand the method. The first paradigm views the <b>blends</b> as <b>surfaces</b> swept out by a family of space curves. The second, more general paradigm considers the surfaces as result of deformation of a parameter space effected by substitution. The method has a general formulation based on projective parameter spaces, but is also the image under projective transformation of the simpler, affine formulation. The deformation by substitution paradigm is extended to <b>blend</b> <b>blending</b> <b>surfaces</b> at solid vertices without a degree penalty, {{under the assumption that}} the vertex valence has been reduced to three. It may also lead to a general solution for blending patches of algebraic surfaces that meet tangentially. A special case of this problem is solved and illustrated...|$|R
40|$|Given a protein, {{analyzing}} the geometric structure of protein is fundamental {{for the study}} of a protein folding, docking, interactions between proteins, and so on. One of the important geometric analyses is computing the molecular surface of protein. Discussed in this paper is an efficient algorithm to compute such a molecular surface of protein via the concept of blending operation among atoms constituting the protein. To facilitate the decision for the existence of <b>blending</b> <b>surface</b> among atoms, we take advantage of the proximity information of Euclidean Voronoi diagram of atoms. The proposed algorithm initially detects topological locations where <b>blending</b> <b>surface</b> exist via both edge accessibility and face accessibility of Euclidean Voronoi diagram...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasingly}} prominent area {{of computer}} science is Computer Aided Geometric Design or CAGD. The main task of CAGD is to automate, {{to the greatest}} extent possible, the process of designing physical objects. A designer typically models an object {{as a collection of}} surfaces. For many objects, design specifications indicate only a few critical surfaces, with the remaining surfaces to be chosen so as to make the surface of the resulting object smooth. Smoothness is important because, in many mechanical objects, sharp edges are undesirable for functional or aesthetic reasons. For example, sharp edges on the interior surface of a gate valve retard fluid flow. Automatically calculating these remaining <b>surfaces,</b> called <b>blending</b> <b>surfaces</b> is an important task in any CAGD system. Therefore, an understanding of the mathematics of surfaces that meet smoothly is fundamental to CAGD. Specifically, this thesis investigates the following problem: given a surface V and a point or curve W on that surface, construct surfaces that meet with V with a specified degree of smoothness along W. Working from a measure of smoothness known as geometric continuity, {{the first half of this}} thesis establishes that the space of all surfaces meeting V with the k-th order geometric continuity along W is directly related to certain algebraic structures called ideals. For example, let Z(M) (the set of point for which a polynomial M is zero) be an irreducible surface that intersects another surface Z(N) transversally (nontangentially) in an irreducible curve Z(M) Z(N). It is shown that a surface Z(F) meets Z(M) with order k geometric continuity along Z(M) Z(N) if and only if F is a polynomial of the form AM = BN^k+ 1 where A and B are free polynomials and A is nonzero on Z(M) Z(N). The second half of this work applies these results to the problem of generating <b>blending</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Using the geometric properties of <b>blending</b> <b>surfaces,</b> it is shown that any surface Z(F) that smooths the intersection of two surfaces Z(M) and Z(N) must have certain algebraic properties. In particular, the degree of F must be greater than or equal to the maximum of the degrees of M^ 2 and N^ 2. Finally, existing methods for constructing <b>blending</b> <b>surfaces</b> are shown to be consistent within the above algebraic framework. In fact, we demonstrate that these distinct methods are instances of a single general method for generating <b>blending</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Moreover, this general method is shown to generate <b>blending</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the lowest possible degree...|$|R
