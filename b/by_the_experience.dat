5|$|Arnhem {{restored}} much of Model's self-confidence, {{which had}} been shaken <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of Normandy. From September to December, he fought another Allied thrust to a standstill, this time by Omar Bradley's U.S. 12th Army Group into the Hürtgen Forest and Aachen.

D'Avalos recognized the relative weakness of his cavalry, but considered it to be compensated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of his infantry and the large number of arquebusiers in its ranks.|$|E

5|$|Shelly becomes possessed as well, forcing Scotty {{to chop up}} {{her body}} with an axe and bury the remains.

5|$|The {{surge of}} German nationalism, stimulated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of Germans in the Napoleonic period and {{initially}} allied with liberalism, shifted political, social, and cultural relationships within the German states. In this context, one can detect {{its roots in}} the experience of Germans in the Napoleonic period. The Burschenschaft student organizations and popular demonstrations, such as those held at Wartburg Castle in October 1817, contributed to a growing sense of unity among German speakers of Central Europe. Furthermore, implicit and sometimes explicit promises made during the War of Liberation engendered an expectation of popular sovereignty and widespread participation in the political process, promises that largely went unfulfilled once peace had been achieved. Agitation by student organizations led such conservative leaders as Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich, to fear the rise of national sentiment; the assassination of German dramatist August von Kotzebue in March 1819 by a radical student seeking unification was followed on 20 September 1819 by the proclamation of the Carlsbad Decrees, which hampered intellectual leadership of the nationalist movement.|$|E
5|$|They added American touches to the course. They {{used the}} names of American birds for patrol names; {{challenged}} patrols {{to make their own}} flags instead of using store-bought flags; introduced patrol totems and signatures; and added singing Back to Gilwell when each patrol's name was mentioned. Each member took turns as the patrol leader, and they met daily as the Patrol Leaders Council to conduct daily inspections. The staff taught course attendees basic Scout requirements and how to handle the U.S. flag. The patrols took an unsupervised patrol hike and overnight camp. Other American features included a program and a service patrol, a cracker barrel after each evening's event, a feast, and other ceremonies. The first course, begun on July 31, 1948, was attended by 29 men from 12 states. Although it rained on four of the nine days, the Scouters were excited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> and enthusiastic about sharing it with others.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of <b>the</b> specialist team {{was associated with}} adverse events following endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. METHODS: The EUROSTAR database is a voluntary registry of 2863 patients admitted to 93 hospitals in Europe with an abdominal aortic aneurysm treated with endovascular stenting. Mortality, rupture {{and the need for}} secondary interventions were the main outcomes. RESULTS: In patients who underwent endovascular stenting <b>by</b> <b>the</b> most <b>experienced</b> specialist teams <b>the</b> mortality rate was 40 % lower than in those treated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> least <b>experienced</b> teams (adjusted hazard ratio 0. 60, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 4 - 1. 0; p = 0. 05). Also patients treated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> most <b>experienced</b> specialist teams were 68 % less likely to have adverse events necessitating a secondary intervention than those treated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> least <b>experienced</b> teams (adjusted hazard ratio 0. 32, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 2 - 0. 5; p < 0. 001). The crude rupture rate was 0. 1 % among patients treated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> most <b>experienced</b> specialist teams and 0. 8 % among those treated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> least <b>experienced</b> teams (p = 0. 74). CONCLUSIONS: Specialist teams {{with a high level of}} experience of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm stenting encounter lower mortality rates and fewer adverse events leading to secondary interventions...|$|R
