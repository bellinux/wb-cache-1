Among all the biomaterials, <b>bioactive</b> glass and <b>glass-ceramics</b> are widely used in orthopedic and dental applications and are being developed for tissue engineering. However, to a large extent, the behavior and overall performance of biomaterials are governed by surface properties. Surface modifications therefore provide unique possibilities to control the subsequent surface interaction and response which are required for particular application. By tailoring the material surface, a wide portfolio of additional functionalities is enabled to overcome material deficiencies while maintaining its bulk material properties. As a consequence, the surface functionalization of materials has become pivotal for academic research as well as industrial product development. Plant-derived polyphenols are compounds possessing one or more aromatic rings {{with one or more}} hydroxyl groups. They are broadly distributed in the plant kingdom and are the most abundant secondary metabolites of plants, with more than 8, 000 phenolic structures currently known, ranging from simple molecules such as phenolic acids to highly polymerized substances such as tannins. Numerous researches and investigation reported the notable biological activities of polyphenol, such as cardiovascular protection, cancer prevention and treatment, antiaging activity as well as applications in Alzheimer's disease, oral health, immune function diabetes and other neurodegenerative disorders. Till now, a number of previous investigations provide a number of surface functionalization techniques and make it possible to graft various kinds of biomolecules such as proteins, growth factors and enzymes to the surface of <b>bioactive</b> glass and <b>glass-ceramics.</b> However, very few researches have been focused on the coupling of natural bioactive polyphenols on surface of <b>bioactive</b> glass and <b>glass-ceramics.</b> As a conclusion, the aim of this thesis is to combine <b>bioactive</b> glasses and <b>glass-ceramics</b> with natural polyphenols, in this case they are grape polyphenol and tea polyphenol extracted from grape skin and green tea respectively, {{in order to make it}} possible to immobilize biomolecules as well as prepare smart biomaterials with both typical inorganic activity and specific biological benefits from natural molecule. This thesis can be divided into five chapters. The first chapter introduces the composition, chemical structure, biological properties and potential applications of plant polyphenols.

Starting with an overview of the fundamental requirements for tissue engineering scaffolds, this article provides a detailed picture on recent developments of porous bioceramics and composites, including a summary of common fabrication technologies and a critical analysis of structure-property and structure-function relationships. Areas of future research are highlighted {{at the end of this}} review, with special attention to the development of multifunctional scaffolds exploiting therapeutic ion/drug release and emerging applications beyond hard tissue repair...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the value of radiopaque while preserving the unique biological properties of bioactive ceramics and composites based on calcium phosphates, bioglasses and glass-ceramics used for bone repair, {{the different kinds of}} doping have been analyzed. By modified method of chemical precipitation the samples of doped hydroxyapatite (HAP) were manufactured with 1 and 3 % calcium atoms substituted by ytterbium, as well as similarly doped <b>bioactive</b> glass and <b>glass-ceramics.</b> The size of the elementary crystals in the doped HAP is almost twice less than in undoped one (respectively 13 and 25 nm). By IR, XPS and XRD methods the structure of the doped HAP have been studied as well as valence state of ytterbium in it. The results revealed formation of homogeneous solid solutions of HAP with ytterbium, where ytterbium ions occupy position of calcium in the apatite crystal lattice being mainly in the trivalent state as Yb³⁺. Radiographs obtained using a typical medical X-ray equipment, confirmed that doping even with 1 % ytterbium significantly increases the radiopaque of the ceramic implants made of HAP. Doping with lanthanide oxides may also significantly improve other properties of bioactive ceramics which are important for their use in medicine and biology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Historically the {{function}} of biomaterials has been to replace diseased or damaged tissues. First generation bio-materials were selected to be as bio-inert as possible and thereby minimize formation of scar tissue at the interface with host tissues. Bioactive glasses were discovered in 1969 and provided {{for the first time}} an alternative; second gen-eration, interfacial bonding of an implant with host tissues. Tissue regeneration and repair using the gene activation prop-erties of Bioglass©R provide a third generation of biomaterials. This article reviews the 40 year history of the development of bioactive glasses, with emphasis on the first composition, 45 S 5 Bioglass©R, that has been in clinical use since 1985. The steps of discovery, characterization, in vivo and in vitro eval-uation, clinical studies and product development are summa-rized along with the technology transfer processes. 1 Prologue: Learning that research is fun It is a great honour and pleasure to share memories of the past and a vision of the future of biomaterials with friends and colleagues at this symposium. Seeing many former students who have all done so well in their careers is a special treat. My goal in this paper is to recount some of the key events that make up the story of Bioglass©R. The story herein will be brief and the references limited. For a more comprehen-sive version see the recent review by myself, June Wilson and Dave Greenspan [1] which summarizes more than 500 papers published about <b>bioactive</b> glasses and <b>glass-ceramics.</b> For a...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Bioactive</b> <b>glass-ceramics</b> of the SiO 2 -CaO-P 2 O 5 -MgO {{system were}} {{fabricated}} by sol-gel-self propagating method. Two Gel-derived materials discs ， 5 S and 3 S ， were prepared by compression of powders. The materials obtained {{were examined in}} vitro {{with regard to the}} dissolution behavior and the formation ability of calcium phosphate layer on the surfaces of samples in simulated body fluid (SBF). Concentration of ions and pH value in SBF were determined by ICP-AES and micro acidity meter after 3 S and 5 S were immerged in SBF for intervals from 6 h to 15 days and the surface characteristic of 3 S and 5 S soaked were determined by SEM. Experiment results showed that the formation ability of calcium phosphate on the surface of gel-derived materials depended on the speed of dissolution of samples, which related to original chemical composition and size of crystal on the surface of materials. With decreasing of Si content and increasing of Ca content, smaller crystal could be formed on the surface of 3 S, which tended to dissolve more quickly in SBF. Solubility product of calcium phosphate can be reached more easily in the solution with high concentration of Ca and P and bone-like carbonate apatite formed easily on the surface of 3 S...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Bioactive</b> <b>glass-ceramics</b> {{have the}} ability to {{directly}} bind to bones and have been widely used as bone graft substi-tutes due to their high osteoconductivity and biocompatibility. CaO-SiO 2 -P 2 O 5 -B 2 O 3 glass-ceramics are known to have good osteo-conductivity and are used as bone graft extenders. Methods: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the resorbing properties of glass-ceramics in bone fusion after producing and analyzing three types of CaO-SiO 2 -P 2 O 5 -B 2 O 3 glass-ceramics with high osteoconductivity that had enhanced resorption by hav-ing an increased B 2 O 3 content. The three types of CaO-SiO 2 -P 2 O 5 -B 2 O 3 glass-ceramics with B 2 O 3 contents of 8. 0, 9. 0, and 9. 5 weight % were designated and grouped as P 20 B 80, P 10 B 90, and P 5 B 95, respectively. Glass-ceramic types were tested for fusion rates and bone formation by employing the lumbar 5 – 6 intertransverse process fusion model in 51 New Zealand male rabbits. Bioactiv-ity was assessed by soaking in simulated body fluid (SBF). Results: In vitro study results showed sufficient hydroxycarbonate apatite layer formation occurred for P 20 B 80 in 1 day, for P 10 B 90 in 3 days, and for P 5 B 95 in 5 days after soaking in SBF. For the rabbit lumbar spine posterolateral fusion model, the autograft group recorded a 100 % fusion rate with levels significantly higher than those of P 20 B 80 (29. 4 %), P 10 B 90 (0 %), and P 5 B 95 (14. 3 %) ...|$|E

The three postmelt compositions were determined using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, and crystallization events were studied using differential thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction. This information {{was used to determine}} heat treatments to prepare glass-ceramics by controlled crystallization. X-ray diffraction analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that, after higher heat treatment temperatures (800 – 900 °C), borosilicate <b>bioactive</b> <b>glass-ceramics</b> (BBGCs) contained mainly borate and silicate crystalline phases. Specifically, BBG-Mg, BBG-Ca, and BBG-Sr glass-ceramics detected the presence of magnesium silicate-Mg 2 (SiO 3) 2 and magnesium borate-Mg 2 B 2 O 5; wollastonite- 2 M-CaSiO 3 and calcium borate-Ca(BO 2) 2; and strontium silicate-SrSiO 3 and strontium borate-Sr 2 B 2 O 5, respectively. In vitro cytotoxicity tests were performed using the mouse fibroblast cell line (L 929). Glass and glass ceramic at concentrations lower than 50 mg/mL did not exhibit any level of cytotoxicity when compared with the control. However, quantitative evaluation indicated that greater cell growth occurred in the presence of materials with crystalline phases. Control of BBGs crystallization may therefore be used to influence the biocompatibility of these glass-ceramic systems. Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (Ph. D.

40|$|In {{the field}} of implantation, the {{delivery}} and/or immobilization of biomolecules developing a specificaction on bone mineralization has attracted great attention {{in the last few}} years. In fact, a widespectrum of enzymes and proteins have been grafted with different methods onto/within implantedmaterials. <b>Bioactive</b> glasses and <b>glass-ceramics,</b> due to their tailorable properties in terms of chemicalcomposition, reactivity, and easiness of manufacturing, represent good scaffolds for enzymeimmobilization. These biomaterials are well known for their peculiar surface reactivity promoting,when contacted with real or simulated body fluids, the formation of an hydroxy-carbonate apatitelayer. The aim of the present contribution has been to immobilize, via a covalent linkage, an enzyme onthe glass surface through the formation of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), in order to obtaina stable bio-conjugate useful as a material bio-implantable into the human body. The innovation of thisstudy resides in the use of a new method of protein immobilization on the glass surface. Unlike otherworks, in which a preliminary silanization process has often been used, the introduction of goldnanoparticles (AuNPs) in the glass composition allowed us to exploit the easy SAMs formation processon the AuNPs dispersed in the bioactive glass matrix and, consequently, to immobilize an enzyme(soybean peroxidase, SBP, in the present case) on the SAMs. A thorough characterization of thematerials, at different steps of the functionalization process, has been also reported, together with invitro activity tests of immobilized SBP, compared with merely adsorbed SBP, and cytotoxicity testsusing human osteoblast (MG- 63) cells. Overall, a new bio-conjugate material, able to maintain itsactivity over time and to decrease the oxidative stress when in contact with MG- 63 cells, has beenobtained...|$|R
40|$|Glass-ceramics {{materials}} {{share many}} properties with both glass and more traditional crystalline ceramics. It is {{formed as a}} glass, and then made to crystallize partly by heat treatment.. <b>Bioactive</b> <b>glass-ceramics</b> describes the beneficial or adverse effects of glass-ceramic with living tissue, when placed in body. Bioactive glasses and glass-ceramics are more and more studied because of their surface chemical reactivity when in contact with body fluids [1 – 3]; by a complex mechanism of ions leaching and partial dissolution of the glass surface, the precipitation of bone-like apatite from the solution provides a strong chemical bonding with tissues. Since bioactive glasses and glass-ceramic are brittle materials, they are especially used in the field of small bone defects reconstruction, or as coatings on inert substrates for load-bearing prostheses. Since the discovery of bioglass by Hench et al. [4] in the early 1970 s, various types of ceramic, glass and glass–ceramic have been proposed and used as bone replacement biomaterials [5 - 7]. Specifically, these biomaterials have found clinical applications as coating for prostheses, bone filler, vertebral substitution and, in a porous form, as bone substitutes [8 - 15]. Most of them are based on the SiO 2 –P 2 O 5 –CaO–Na 2 O system. Bonding between bioactive glass or glass–ceramic and the surrounding tissues takes place through the formation of a hydroxyapatite layer, which is very similar to the mineral phase of bone. When the bioactive glass is placed in contact with physiological fluids, this layer is formed through a complex ion-exchange mechanism with the surrounding fluids, known as bioactivity. This biologically-active layer of hydroxyapatite can form on the surface of glasses having a wide compositional range, and is considered as self by the surrounding living tissue; its presence is widely recognized to be a sufficient requirement for the implant to chemically bond with the living bone. Kokubo et al. [16] proposed the Tris-buffered simulated body fluid (SBF) for the in vitro study of bioactive glass and glass–ceramic, since its ion concentration is almost equal to that of human blood plasma. Since then, in vitro tests in SBF have been widely used as preliminary tests on new candidate materials showing bioactive properties. The ion leaching phenomenon involves the exchange of monovalent cations from the glass, such as Na+ or K+, with H 3 O+ from the solution, and thus causes an increase in the pH of the solution. It is known that osteoblasts prefer a slightly alkaline medium [17, 18], but it is also known that severe changes in pH can inhibit osteoblast activity and cause cell necrosis or apoptosis [19 - 21]. Different bioactive glass and glass ceramics have been synthesized in order to get desired mechanical, chemical properties by obtaining required microstructure. Some of common components used are Na 2 O, CaO, P 2 O 5, SiO 2 for synthesis of 45 S 5 and S 53 P 4. In addition to these above components, varying composition of K 2 O, MgO, B 2 O 3 are used to get 13 - 93, 3 - 04, 18 - 04, 23 - 04. There are some other glass and glass ceramics which also include ZnO, Ag and Al 2 O 3. In current study of bioactive glass ceramic we are using rice husk ash as raw material for synthesis of silica, which is amorphous in nature. It is cheap, easily available source with high content of silica...|$|E
