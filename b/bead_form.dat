He {{enhanced}} and honed his military scouting skills amidst the Zulu in the early 1880s in the Natal province of South Africa, where his regiment had been posted, and where he was Mentioned in Despatches. During one of his travels, he came across a large string of wooden beads. Although Baden-Powell claimed the beads had been those of the Zulu king Dinizulu, one researcher learned from Baden-Powell's diary only {{that he had taken}} beads from a dead woman's body around that time, and indeed the <b>bead</b> <b>form</b> is more similar to dowry beads than to warrior beads. The beads were later incorporated into the Wood Badge training programme he started after he founded the Scouting Movement. Baden-Powell's skills impressed his superiors and he was brevetted Major as Military Secretary and senior Aide-de-camp of the Commander-in-Chief and Governor of Malta, his uncle General Sir Henry Augustus Smyth. He was posted in Malta for three years, also working as intelligence officer for the Mediterranean for the Director of Military Intelligence. He frequently travelled disguised as a butterfly collector, incorporating plans of military installations into his drawings of butterfly wings. In 1884 he published Reconnaissance and Scouting.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine, experimentally, if distinguishing characteristics exist between the <b>beads</b> <b>formed</b> on energized and non-energized wires exposed to various thermal insults. Most of research published in the literature has not tested energized and non-energized wires under the same thermal conditions. The tests in this study were conducted using convective, radiative and combined convective/radiative thermal exposures. Wires were tested in both energized and non-energized states. Energized wires were tested under "load" and "no load" conditions. <b>Beads</b> <b>formed</b> on both the energized and non-energized wires as results of thermal exposure. Beads were analyzed externally and internally with stereo microscope, SEM/EDS, and a metallurgical microscope. No clear trends or distinguishing visual or microscopic characteristics between the <b>beads</b> <b>formed</b> on energized and non-energized wires were found. The bead analysis methods used during this research showed that {{it is not possible to}} distinguish between the <b>beads</b> <b>formed</b> on energized and non-energized wires exposed to various thermal insults...|$|R

5000|$|Though {{technically}} {{made from}} glass, the lapidary style of bead production is {{more akin to}} stone working than proper glass manufacturing. This process involved the recycling of imported glass by chipping, knapping, drilling and polishing pieces to a desired <b>bead</b> <b>form.</b> Evidence from areas outside of Ile-Ife, Nigeria suggests that individuals scavenged for discarded glass remains from earlier burial sites at Olokun Grove.

50|$|Not {{unlike other}} intumescents, sodium silicate, both in <b>bead</b> <b>form</b> and in liquid form, are {{inherently}} endothermic, due to liquid {{water in the}} water glass and hydrates in the prill form. The absence in the US of mandatory aging tests, whereby PFP systems are made to undergo system performance tests after the aging and humidity exposures, are {{at the root of}} the continued availability, in North America, of PFP products that can become inoperable within weeks of installation. Indiscriminate use of sodium silicates without proper waterproofing measures are contributors to the problems and risk. When sodium silicates are adequately protected, they function extremely well and reliably for long periods. Evidence of this can be seen in the many DIBt approvals for plastic pipe firestop devices using Palusol, which use waterproofed sodium silicate sheets.|$|E

40|$|This {{work has}} used novel polymer design and {{fabrication}} technology to generate <b>bead</b> <b>form</b> polymer based systems, with variable, yet controlled release properties, {{specifically for the}} delivery of macromolecules, essentially peptides of therapeutic interest. The work involved investigation of the potential interaction between matrix ultrastructural morphology, in vitro release kinetics, bioactivity and immunoreactivity of selected macromolecules with limited hydrolytic stability, delivered from controlled release vehicles. The underlying principle involved photo-polymerisation of the monomer, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, around frozen ice crystals, leading {{to the production of}} a macroporous hydrophilic matrix. <b>Bead</b> <b>form</b> matrices were fabricated in controllable size ranges in the region of 100 µm - 3 mm in diameter. The initial stages of the project involved the study of how variables, delivery speed of the monomer and stirring speed of the non solvent, affectedthe formation of macroporous <b>bead</b> <b>form</b> matrices. From this an optimal bench system for bead production was developed. Careful selection of monomer, solvents, crosslinking agent and polymerisation conditions led to a variable but controllable distribution of pore sizes (0. 5 - 4 µm). Release of surrogate macromolecules, bovine serum albumin and FITC-linked dextrans, enabled factors relating to the size and solubility of the macromolecule on the rate of release to be studied. Incorporation of bioactive macromolecules allowed retained bioactivity to be determined (glucose oxidase and interleukin- 2), whilst the release of insulin enabled determination of both bioactivity (using rat epididymal fat pad) and immunoreactivity (RIA). The work carried out has led to the generation of macroporous <b>bead</b> <b>form</b> matrices, fabricated from a tissue biocompatible hydrogel, capable of the sustained, controlled release of biologically active peptides, with potential use in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries...|$|E

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{a comparison of}} a bead and powder form of anion exchange resin for removing humic matter from groundwater. The materials and procedures described herein involve a manufactured dry humic matter and two forms of the same anion exchange resin. Spectroscopy was the chosen procedure for analysis of organics. ^ Preliminary experiments were required {{to gain a better}} understanding of the materials and to prepare the best conditions for actual experimental research. Five concentrations of humic acid were used for experimental purposes at 0. 5, 1, 5, 10 and 20 mg/L. Three concentrations of resin were used: 500, 750 and 1000 mg/L for both bead and powder form of resin. These humic acid concentrations were chosen because ranges found in nature are between 1 - 10 mg/L. Resin concentrations were selected after a set of preliminary experiments was conducted. ^ This research tested the hypothesis that more surface area on the powder form of resin will result in more and faster organic removal compared to the same resin in <b>bead</b> <b>form.</b> After applying kinetic model equations the hypothesis was proven correct. The resin in powder form achieved approximately 90 % removal of humic matter in 10 min minutes; the resin in <b>bead</b> <b>form</b> achieved only approximately 30 % removal in 15 minutes. ^ Kinetic experiments were conducted for different combinations of resin and humic acid. Kinetic experiments show the change in concentration over a period of time; this is useful to better understand the removal reaction that is occurring. Data was collected in the laboratory to obtain first and second order kinetic plots and results were compared to determine best fitting. Second order showed higher correlation for both forms of resin with r-squared values no less than 0. 95. ^ Batch equilibrium experiments were conducted to study the effect of pH and feed concentration on humic acid removal efficiency. Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models were applied to correlate the experimental data. The results proved conclusive with a favor of Langmuir isotherm. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the inter-relationship between process variables and the size and shape of pectin solution droplets upon detachment from a dripping tip as well as Ca-pectinate <b>beads</b> <b>formed</b> after gelation via image analysis. The sphericity factor (SF) of the droplets was generally smaller than 0. 05. There was no specific trend between the SF of the droplets and the pectin concentration or the dripping tip radius. The SF the <b>beads</b> <b>formed</b> from high-concentration pectin solutions and a small dripping tip was smaller than 0. 05.

The lower boundary of the operating region has to be revised to Oh = 2. 3. This is because the critical viscosity for Ca-pectinate bead formation is higher than that of Ca-alginate beads.
