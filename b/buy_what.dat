25|$|Result: Kinetic {{immediately}} left Tussauds, but initially {{suffered a}} lack of organization, with Haya not setting a specific list of who should <b>buy</b> <b>what,</b> which nearly resulted in the team buying two three-piece suits for Tussauds' Justin Bieber waxwork. However, the team generally negotiated well, with James in particular being a stand-out. One item which caused the team trouble was a Dashiki, which they spent the day fruitlessly searching for, with Harry H. being mistakenly told it was an Arabic garment instead of an African one. Despite being initially more organized, Atomic's sub-team, Zara and Hayley, wasted time travelling to and from Croydon {{in order to obtain}} a pocketwatch which they paid wildly over the odds for, under the mistaken belief that they were required to purchase one made of gold. On top of that, Harry M. led the team on a wild chase to buy the suit, continually asking adult tailors even after repeatedly being told that they would need to ask a children's tailor for a suit in Bieber's dimensions. Lizzie also made a serious mistake by deciding not to negotiate any discount on a set of shoes {{near the end of the}} day, resulting in a massive fine, with Lord Sugar noting that they would have actually received less of a fine by just not buying the shoes. Kinetic spent £969.10, while Atomic spent £1,480.87.|$|E

2500|$|Since...Labor {{under our}} wage-system, our profit-system, our fleecings-system, only {{receives}} about one half [...] as its share, {{it follows that}} the producers cannot buy back that which they create. * [...] * [...] * For the more Capital is being accumulated in private hands, the more impossible this wage-system renders it for the producers to <b>buy</b> <b>what</b> they produce.

2500|$|Intention (1957) is {{also the}} classic source for {{the idea that there}} is a {{difference}} in [...] "direction of fit" [...] between cognitive states like beliefs and conative states like desire. Cognitive states describe the world and are causally derived from the facts or objects they depict. Conative states do not describe the world, but aim to bring something about in the world. Anscombe used the example of a shopping list to illustrate the difference. The list can be a straightforward observational report of what is actually bought (thereby acting like a cognitive state), or it can function as a conative state such as a command or desire, dictating what the agent should buy. If the agent fails to <b>buy</b> <b>what</b> is listed, we do not say that the list is untrue or incorrect; we say that the mistake is in the action, not the desire. According to Anscombe, this difference in direction of fit is a major difference between speculative knowledge (theoretical, empirical knowledge) and practical knowledge (knowledge of actions and morals). Whereas [...] "speculative knowledge" [...] is [...] "derived from the objects known", practical knowledge is – in a phrase Anscombe lifts from Aquinas – [...] "the cause of what it understands".|$|E
2500|$|Food was {{an ongoing}} matter {{of concern for}} the POWs. The {{recommended}} dietary intake for a normal healthy inactive adult male is [...] Luft III issued [...] "Non-working" [...] German civilian rations which allowed [...] per day, with the balance made up from American, Canadian, and British Red Cross parcels and items sent to the POWs by their families. As was customary at most camps, Red Cross and individual parcels were pooled and distributed to the men equally. The camp also had an official internal bartering system called a Foodacco – POWs marketed surplus goods for [...] "points" [...] that could be [...] "spent" [...] on other items. The Germans paid captured officers the equivalent of their pay in internal camp currency (lagergeld), which was used to <b>buy</b> <b>what</b> goods were made available by the German administration. Every three months, weak beer was made available in the canteen for sale. As NCOs did not receive any [...] "pay" [...] it was the usual practice in camps for the officers to provide one-third for their use but at Luft III all lagergeld was pooled for communal purchases. As British government policy was to deduct camp pay from the prisoners' military pay, the communal pool avoided the practice in other camps whereby American officers contributed to British canteen purchases.|$|E
