2500|$|Bicycle cranks {{can vary}} in length to {{accommodate}} different sized riders and {{different types of}} cycling. Crank length is measured {{from the center of}} the pedal spindle to the center of the bottom bracket spindle or axle. The larger bicycle component manufacturers typically offer crank lengths for adult riders from 165mm to 180mm long in 2.5mm increments, with 170mm cranks being the most common size. A few small specialty manufacturers make bicycle cranks in a number of sizes smaller than 165mm and longer than 180mm. Some manufacturers also make bicycle cranks that can be adjusted to different lengths. While logic would suggest that, all other things being equal, riders with shorter legs should use proportionally shorter cranks and those with longer legs should use proportionally longer cranks, this is not universally accepted. However, very few scientific studies have definitively examined the effect of crank length on sustained cycling performance and the studies' results have been mixed. <b>Bicycle</b> <b>crank</b> length has not been easy to study scientifically for a number of reasons, chief among them being that cyclists are able to physiologically adapt to different crank lengths. Cyclists are typically more efficient pedalling cranks with which they have had an adaptation period. Several different formulas exist to calculate appropriate crank length for various riders. In addition to the rider's size, another factor affecting the selection of crank length is the rider's cycling specialty and the type of cycling event. Historically, bicycle riders have typically chosen proportionally shorter cranks for higher cadence cycling such as criterium and track racing, while riders have chosen proportionally longer cranks for lower cadence cycling such as time trial racing and mountain biking. However, the evolution of very low rider torso positions to reduce aerodynamic drag for time trial racing and triathlon cycling can also affect crank selection for such events. Some have suggested that proportionally shorter cranks may have a slight advantage for a rider with a very low torso position and an actute hip angle, especially as the rider pedals near the top-dead-center position of the pedal stroke. Cranks can be shortened for medical reasons using shorteners such as Ortho Pedal ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of newly proposed <b>bicycle’s</b> <b>crank</b> to crank angle setting on the Vastus Lateralis (VL) and Bicep Femoris (BF) muscle activity during cycling. Procedures of Conconi Test were used throughout the experiment for the data collection purpose. The muscles activities were recorded using surface electromyography and software LabChart 7. The raw data were further processed in time (Root-Mean-Square, RMS) and frequency (Mean Power Frequency, MPF) domain. It was found that 0 ° crank to crank setting (similar to conventional crank to crank angle setting) caused the prime mover VL (Normalized RMS = 0. 119) to fatigue more than BF (Normalized RMS = 0. 102). This setting is expected to decrease the cycling performance. In addition, − 5 ° is the best crank to crank angle setting that causes least fatigue to both VL and BF. In short, to increase the cycling performance by avoiding the fatigue to the main muscles, − 5 ° is the suggested as setting angle for the proposed crank design...|$|R

50|$|A cyclist {{executing}} a basic track stand {{holds the}} <b>bicycle's</b> <b>cranks</b> in a horizontal position, {{with his or}} her dominant foot forward. Track stands executed on bicycles with a freewheel usually employ a small uphill section of ground. The uphill needs to be sufficient to allow the rider to create backward motion by relaxing pressure on the pedals, thus allowing the bike to roll backwards. Once the track stand is mastered, even a very tiny uphill section is sufficient: e.g. the camber of the road, a raised road marking, and so on. Where no such uphill exists, or even if the gradient is downhill, a track stand can be achieved on a freewheeling bicycle by using a brake to initiate a backwards movement. If a fixed-gear bicycle is being used, an uphill slope is not needed since the rider is able to simply back pedal to move backwards. In both cases forward motion is accomplished by pedalling forwards. The handlebars are held at approximately a 45 degree angle, converting the bike's forward and back motion into side-to-side motion beneath the rider's body. This allows the rider to keep the bike directly below their center of gravity.|$|R

The IDrive attempts to maximize the efficiency of the transmission of energy from the rider to the rear wheel. The bottom bracket is placed eccentric in a bearing within the swingarm, the distance between the center of the bearing and the bottom bracket effectively creating a very short link, and the swingarm itself creating another.

Jhai enlisted some of the sharpest minds in Silicon Valley to devise a machine that could operate in harsh conditions and with no technical support. Instead of a hard drive with moving and delicate parts, the Jhai PC relies on flash memory chips to store data. The PC is assembled from off-the-shelf components and uses less than 20 watts during normal use. The machine is so rugged its creators say it can survive dirt, heat and even immersion in water. And the power supply? The solution is simple: pedal power.

40|$|Independent cranks (IC) are {{recently}} introduced <b>bicycle</b> <b>cranks</b> that are decoupled; therefore allowing each leg to pedal {{independent of the}} other. Despite this introduction, limited {{research has been conducted}} assessing biomechanical changes when cycling with IC. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate and compare trunk kinematics and surface electromyography (sEMG) during IC and normal crank (NC) cycling during a graded exercise test to volitional fatigue. Ten healthy, physically active men performed two tests (IC and NC) on a cycling ergometer on separate days. 3 D motion capture data of the trunk and pelvis and sEMG of the latissimus dorsi, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius lateral head, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis and the biceps femoris were collected bilaterally. The first 30 seconds (beginning) and the last 30 seconds (end) of each trial were analyzed with respect to external load (beginning vs end), crank type (IC vs NC) side (left vs right), and phase of the pedal cycle (push vs recovery). Mean load at volitional fatigue in NC (351 W) was significantly greater than IC (318 W; p < 0. 001). As external load increased, there was a similar increase in spine flexion angle in the sagittal plane for both NC (8. 2 °) and IC (4. 6 °). The NC condition demonstrated significantly greater increase in muscle activation from the beginning to the end than the IC condition in the tibialis anterior, rectus femoris and biceps femoris in the push phase, and the rectus femoris and biceps femoris in the recovery phase. As IC demonstrated less increase in activation, they cause less variation in muscular contraction from beginning to end throughout the full pedal range of motion, yet do not alter gross trunk kinematics. Due to altered muscle activation patterns when cycling with IC, they are proposed as a potentially beneficial training tool to increase training diversity...|$|R

Bulk moulding compound (B. M. C.) was manufactured by mixing strands (> 1 ”) of chopped carbon fibres in a mixer with polyester resin. The crank body is treated as a composite sandwichstructure, where the interior is a short fibre layer (B. M.

The composite material was hot pressed and manufactured into crank body to reduce most of its weight. In the CMprocess, the long and short fibre layers were joined together by a metallic interface ring. Its characteristics include base composite material, interface ring, hollow square inner wall and exterior projected rib. The inner reinforcing layer provides the maximum bending strength and to reduce stress concentration of themetallic interface ring- to-crank attachment.
