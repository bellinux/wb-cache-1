5|$|Dr. Mario {{offers a}} {{multiplayer}} gaming mode {{in which two}} players compete {{against each other in}} separate playing fields. In this mode, the player's goal is to clear their own playing field of viruses <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> player does. Eliminating multiple viruses or initiating chain reactions can cause additional capsules to fall onto the opponent's playing field. A player wins a single game upon eliminating all the viruses or if the other playing field fills up. The first player to win three games wins overall.|$|E
5|$|Of the film's net profit, {{estimated}} to amount to $30–40million (£20–25million) from the cinema release alone, roughly 20% will be split between Geoffrey Rush (as executive producer), Tom Hooper and Colin Firth, who receive their bonuses <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> stakeholders. The remaining profit {{is to be}} split equally between the producers and the equity investors. The UK Film Council invested £1million of public funds from the United Kingdom lottery into the film. In March 2011 Variety estimated that the return could be between fifteen and twenty times that. The Council's merger into the British Film Institute means that the profits are {{to be returned to}} that body.|$|E
5|$|Celebrations {{to honor}} the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's first trans-Atlantic voyage were held in several countries; Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie, Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf, and Kaiser Franz Joseph I {{represented}} Austria-Hungary during the ceremonies in Genoa, Italy, Columbus's birthplace. During the 1893 fleet maneuvers, Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie was mobilized to train alongside the ironclads Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf, , , and , among other vessels. Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie took part in an international naval demonstration off Crete in 1897 {{during a period of}} tension between Greece and the Ottoman Empire that culminated in the Greco-Turkish War. The Austro-Hungarian contingent, which also included the armored cruiser , and the torpedo cruisers , , and , three destroyers, and eight torpedo boats, was the third largest squadron {{to take part in the}} demonstration, after the British and Italian fleets. Austria-Hungary, displeased with the settlement that left Crete with a Greek ruler but nominally under Turkish control, withdrew its ships in March 1898, <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> members of the international fleet.|$|E

5|$|Defeat at the Battle of Ajnadayn left Syria {{vulnerable}} to the Muslim army. Khalid decided to capture Damascus, the Byzantine stronghold. At Damascus, Thomas, son-in-law of Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, {{was in charge of}} the city's defense. Receiving intelligence of Khalid’s march towards Damascus he prepared the city's defences. He wrote to Emperor Heraclius, who was at Emesa that time, for reinforcement. Moreover, Thomas, in order to delay or halt Khalid's advance and to attain time to prepare for a siege, sent his armies to move forward. Two of his armies were routed first at Yaqusa in mid-August and the other at Maraj as-Saffar on 19 August. Meanwhile, Heraclius' reinforcements reached Damascus <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> column of Heraclius reached the city which Khalid laid siege to on 20 August. To isolate Damascus from the rest of the region, Khalid placed the detachments south on the road to Palestine and in north at the Damascus-Emesa route, and several other smaller detachments on routes towards Damascus. Heraclius' reinforcements were intercepted and routed by Khalid at the Battle of Sanita-al-Uqab 30km from Damascus.|$|E
5|$|In Kansas City, Kansas, two {{religious}} missionaries visit {{two women}} at two different {{homes in the}} same neighborhood who look exactly alike. The second woman yells at them to go away and the two men, inexplicably, get into a fight in the second woman's front yard. Later, two FBI agents who look and sound remarkably similar to Mulder and Scully visit the first woman, Betty Templeton (Kathy Griffin). Betty claims to have never seen the other woman <b>before.</b> <b>The</b> <b>other</b> woman then passes her by in a car and the two agents begin fighting each other, much like the missionaries. They are severely injured after the gruesome mauling. Both agents, who had worked together for seven years, said that they were possessed. Meanwhile, the other woman, Lulu Pfeiffer (also Kathy Griffin), applies for a job at Koko's Copies, but does not get it because she has had 17 jobs in 17 states {{in the past three years}} and moves around too much. She becomes aggravated and suddenly, all the copies become black. The other woman, Betty, goes to another job with the same name and same resume.|$|E
5|$|The {{allies were}} aware of Rupert's {{approach}} and had been hoping that reinforcements from the Midlands under Sir John Meldrum and the Earl of Denbigh could ward off this threat, but they learned that these forces could not intervene in time. The allied armies around York were separated from each other by rivers, and if Rupert attacked them in their siege lines he could destroy any one army <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two could come to its aid. Therefore, they abandoned the siege {{on the night of}} 30 June, and concentrated their forces near the village of Hessay before taking position on Marston Moor, where they blocked Rupert's expected direct march to York (along the old Roman road named Ermine Street, the modern A59), and could easily move to their left to prevent Rupert making any move to the south via Wetherby.|$|E

25|$|Stable sort {{algorithms}} sort identical {{elements in}} the same order that they appear in the input. When sorting some kinds of data, only part of the data is examined when determining the sort order. For example, in the card sorting example to the right, the cards are being sorted by their rank, and their suit is being ignored. This allows the possibility of multiple different correctly sorted versions of the original list. Stable sorting algorithms choose one of these, according to the following rule: if two items compare as equal, like the two 5 cards, then their relative order will be preserved, so that if one came <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> in the input, it will also come <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> in the output.|$|E

25|$|At private schools, kinders usually {{consist of}} three grades, {{and a fourth}} one may be added for nursery. The fourth one is called maternal.
