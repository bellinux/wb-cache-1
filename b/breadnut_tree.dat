25|$|By roughly 6000 BC, hunter-gatherers {{living in}} the {{highlands}} and lowlands of Mesoamerica began to develop agricultural practices with early cultivation of squash and chilli. The earliest example of maize dates to c. 4000 BC and comes from Guilá Naquitz, a cave in Oaxaca. Earlier maize samples have been documented at the Los Ladrones cave site in Panama, c. 5500 BC. Slightly thereafter, other crops began to be cultivated by the semi-agrarian communities throughout Mesoamerica. Although maize {{is the most common}} domesticate, the common bean, tepary bean, scarlet runner bean, jicama, tomato and squash all became common cultivates by 3500 BC. At the same time, cotton, yucca and agave were exploited for fibers and textile materials. By 2000 BC, corn was the staple crop in the region and remained so through modern times. The Ramón or <b>Breadnut</b> <b>tree</b> (Brosimum alicastrum) was an occasional substitute for maize in producing flour. Fruit was also important in the daily diet of Mesoamerican cultures. Some of the main ones consumed include avocado, papaya, guava, mamey, zapote, and annona.|$|E

5000|$|Melanesia. A small section with palms chiefly {{native to}} Fiji and Vanuatu. Large adult palms are Carpoxylon, Veitchia vitiensis and Pritchardia pacifica. Other {{interesting}} palms are Metroxylon vitiense and Pelagodoxa henryana, growing by two <b>breadnut</b> <b>trees,</b> nonis and other trees and shrubs.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Breadnut</b> <b>trees</b> {{can usually}} be found in {{tropical}} environments along low-lying areas at an elevationof 0 - 1550 m, inundated riverbanks, and in freshwater swamps. [...] The plant grows best at a mean annual temperature of 15 - 40 C in deep, well drained soil with a neutral to alkaline soil acidity.|$|R

50|$|The {{morphology}} of the <b>breadnut</b> is a <b>tree</b> up to 35 m {{tall with}} leaves 40-60 cm long and 25-45 cm wide and are pinnately lobed. The plant is monoecious {{and the male}} and female flowers occur at the tips of branches. Each male flower has two anthers, and is 3 cm in diameter and 25-35 cm long. Additionally, each male flower is club-shaped, thousands of them grouped together in an inflorescence.|$|R
