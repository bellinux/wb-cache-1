25|$|Officially the {{government}} of Pakistan is committed to provide every citizen an access to education, <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> that its budget allocation towards education does not correspond with its former commitment. The expenditure on education {{as a percentage of}} GDP was 1.82% in 2000–2001, while it has been raised slightly in 2006–2007 to 2.42%, and it is still relatively lower than most neighboring countries. Feminist economists argue that {{the government}} of Pakistan needs to fully address and resolve the gender concerns that exist in the educational sector. They suggest that one of the ways to improve this situation is by increasing funding for women's education, encourage and financially incentivize people in the rural areas to send their girls to schools. In the apprentice of gender studies, the gender division of labor is considered patriarchal, and feminists argue that it can be consciously neutralized by the public policies, i.e. encouraging girls to study mathematics, science, computers, and business administration etc. This way, girls will specialize in higher paying fields (jobs) instead of solely focusing on care work.|$|E

2500|$|Civil {{unions are}} {{commonly}} criticised as being 'separate <b>but</b> equal', <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> they segregate same-sex couples by {{forcing them to}} use a separate institution. Supporters of same-sex marriage contend that treating same-sex couples differently from other couples under the law allows for inferior treatment and that if civil unions {{were the same as}} marriage there would be no reason for two separate laws. A New Jersey commission which reviewed the state's civil union law reported that the law [...] "invites and encourages unequal treatment of same-sex couples and their children". Some have suggested that creating civil unions which are open to opposite-sex couples would avoid the accusations of apartheid. These have still been criticised as being 'separate but equal' by former New Zealand MP and feminist Marilyn Waring as same-sex couples remain excluded from the right to marry.|$|R

Wazed has also had conflicts with Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and refused to publicly denounce Islamic extremists {{for the murder of}} Bangladeshi atheists, in order to avoid alienating the country's conservative clergy, despite professing himself as a secularist.|$|E

It is a main argument against claims that Europe limits national sovereignty <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> that it is a principle to which lip service only is paid, and, in practice, the reach of the EU has been increasingly ambitious.|$|E
2500|$|Meles Zenawi's {{administration}} {{was the first}} to introduce private press in Ethiopia. However, he has been under fire often for imprisonment of journalists and lately for some website censorship. The Meles government defends its action on the ground that the banned media outlets advocated [...] "a certain population should be quarantined" [...] and incited [...] "violence among different ethnic groups in the country," [...] including using hate-filled text messages on mobile phones asking people to attack ethnic groups. Some sources blame certain websites and papers who have been caught inciting violence and asking for bombings on companies. A couple of them have even been sued for provoking uprising. Others claim that the supporters of the previous dictatorship government are trying to use the new opportunity to freely express themselves by defaming the current government officials. <b>But</b> the government <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> that the ruling party is not willing to be criticised. Many reports of international organizations support their claim. Strong criticism came from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). In its 2007 press freedom summary it wrote, [...] "Ethiopia [...] the world's worst backslider on press freedom over the previous five years". At the start of 2010, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that an Ethiopian journalist has been jailed for a year for criticising Meles.|$|R

However, the Pope {{has been linked to}} the fall of Jean-Claude Duvalier's dictatorship in Haiti. He was also critical of the Chinese Communist regime and the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association running the church and appointing bishops without the consent of the Holy See, and maintained strong ties with underground Catholic groups.|$|R

Nevertheless, such behavior may be justified by characterizing the client as demanding, angry or [...] "needing limits". To overcome this, {{it has been suggested that}} power-sharing should be cultivated and that when respectful communication breaks down, the first thing that needs to be asked is whether mentalist prejudices have been expressed.|$|E

Ground traffic controllers, and approach controllers whose sector is within 5 mi of the runway would have remained at PBIA. The FAA cited the move as a cost-cutting measure, <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> that it creates a risk to South Florida air traffic if the Miami facility is damaged in a hurricane, or terrorist attack. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association opposed the move.

40|$|In {{what many}} {{consider}} a historic step toward changing Mexico's antiquated petroleum sector, the Congress approved legislation {{to overhaul the}} state-run oil company PEMEX. The measure was approved overwhelmingly {{in both houses of}} Congress in October, although there was some dissent within the ranks of the center-left Partido de la Revolucion Democratica (PRD). Some members of the PRD broke with their moderate colleagues because of opposition to a provision that allows PEMEX to hire private and foreign companies for key activities in the oil sector. Another key change that allows the company more control of its revenues received overwhelming support. <b>But</b> some <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> the reform plan, which was diluted from President Felipe Calderon's original proposal, is insufficient to help reverse Mexico's declining production. President Calderon first offered plan in April The proposal to overhaul PEMEX had been in the works since April of this year, when Calderon first introduced his plan to Congress. At that time, the plan met strong opposition, with legislators from opposing parties concerned that the proposal potentially violated the Mexican Constitution. Even with those concerns, Calderon pushed for the Congress to vote on the legislation to reform PEMEX in a special session during the summer months. Legislators rejected that proposal, saying they needed more time to consider an initiative with such far-reaching implications for the country. As legislators were considering the various proposals for PEMEX reform, a faction of the PRD along with allies from the Partido del Trabajo (PT) and Partido Convergencia por la Democracia (PCD) pushed to have Calderon withdraw his plan altogether. This group, which was allied with the PRD's ex-presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, opposed any form of private participation in PEMEX...|$|R

50|$|DIBELS {{has become}} a fairly widely used {{assessment}} for early reading intervention by many schools in the United States but since its development and release {{there have been many}} critics challenging the effectiveness and validity of the DIBELS assessments. One criticism has been that although the Official DIBELS homepage claims that there is an abundance of research validating the DIBELS assessments much of that was unpublished. “Of the 89 references listed, only 18 are published in professional reviewed journals in the fields of psychology, special education, or music therapy, and eight are chapters in edited books” (Nancy Rankie Shelton, 2009). Reidel (2007) has a similar criticism in saying that the DIBELS developers claim that the research base was the reason for the widespread use of the assessments, <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> the political pressure to use DIBELS {{as a part of the}} Reading First Initiative was the reason for the widespread adoption. In 2005 an article by Kathleen Manzo states; DIBELS got the competitive edge because its developers and their colleagues at the University of Oregon were consultants to the U.S. Department of Education for Reading First, with one of the main developers, Mr. Good, being one of the persons who evaluated 29 early literacy tests including his own product.|$|E
