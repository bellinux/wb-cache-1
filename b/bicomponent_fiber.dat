40|$|A {{new water}} {{deionization}} method was conceived and investigated. Bench scale reactors were designed and tested. Numerical analysis of ion movement in {{water in the}} presence of electrical, hydraulic, and chemical gradients was conducted. The new water treatment technology uses bicomponent fibers (BCF). Ions in water are concentrated near charged bicomponent fibers. Bicomponent fibers are composed of two materials. The outer annulus is made of nylon and has an inside diameter of 10 mum and outer diameter of 50 mum. The inner annulus is composed of carbon powder and has an outer diameter of 10 mum. For the bench scale reactors, approximately one kilometer length of fibers was wrapped around a series of plastic panels and placed in a plexiglass container containing sodium nitrate solution. The ends of the fibers were covered with electrically conductive epoxy and connected to a DC power supply. In experiments which lasted up to 96 h., the solution showed up to 50 percent decrease in nitrate concentration after the power supply was applied. Preliminary studies indicated that distance between panels, polarity of panels and voltage magnitude influenced observed concentration. Two one dimensional analytical solutions and finite element solutions for two dimensions were derived for no flow condition between parallel plates. For the first finite element model, the continuity, Navier-Stokes, and species equations were solved for solute concentration with rectangular coordinates. For the second model, Poisson-Boltzmann equations were included in a finite element scheme. The models were applied to irregular-shaped bodies and the finite element solutions were compared with analytical solutions. The solutions for Poisson-Boltzmann equations were obtained for both linearized and non-linear forms. Boundary conditions included no chemical reactions and no transport across boundaries. The formulations did not solve for concentration in <b>bicomponent</b> <b>fiber</b> reactors because insufficient data and knowledge of the <b>bicomponent</b> <b>fiber</b> process is available. However, future numerical models of the <b>bicomponent</b> <b>fiber</b> treatment process may be based on solutions derived in this research...|$|E

An electrically conductive compound of carbon black (CB) and high density polyethylene was used as core material, working as an inner electrode. A force sensor consisting {{of a number of}} fibers embedded in a soft CB/polyolefin elastomer matrix was manufactured for characterization. The fibers showed a clear piezoelectric effect, with a voltage output (peak-to-peak) of up to 40 mV under lateral compression.

40|$|Bicomponent fibers {{consisting}} of nylon- 6 and isotactic polypropylene were produced. In-situ, reactive compatibilization was achieved using a maleic anhydride functionalized polypropylene between the materials at the interface. The overall {{goal of the}} research was to produce a <b>bicomponent</b> <b>fiber</b> of these materials that would be suitable for use in commercial carpet applications. Carpet samples produced using nylon- 6 core / polypropylene sheath bicomponent fibers displayed stain resistance comparable to a wholly polypropylene carpet. The wear characteristics of these fibers {{were found to be}} strongly dependent upon the maleic anhydride content and the molecular weight of the maleic anhydride functionalized polypropylene. Adhesion between the nylon- 6 and polypropylene phases, and the mechanical properties of the polypropylene phase were affected by the addition of the functionalized polypropylene.

In this research, polycaprolactone/poly (lactic acid) side-by-side <b>bicomponent</b> <b>fibers</b> were created for the application of a biodegradable scaffold. The side-by-side structure endowed the fiber with self-crimps when it was processed under certain conditions. This material was produced by electrospinning and collected on a high speed rotating mandrel to get highly oriented fibers. A mechanical stretch at the same direction was done followed by a wet heat treatment for polymer retraction. Crimped fibers were demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. The quantitative porosity and uniaxial tensile strength was not affected by the post-treatments, but the cell ingrowth and proliferation after seeding the scaffold were significantly improved. In conclusion, the side-by-side crimped material serves as a better extracellular matrix analogue without sacrificing mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} on {{all aspects of}} thermally point bonded nonwovens has led to considerable improvements {{in the understanding of}} material requirements for these nonwovens, the changes that occur during bonding and the resultant deterioration of the mechanical properties of the nonwoven materials. This paper addresses how one may use a <b>bicomponent</b> <b>fiber</b> technology to overcome the shortcomings of the thermal bonding and obtain high strength spunbond fabrics. In particular, we present the utility of islands-in-the-sea (I/S) bicomponent fibers for optimizing the strength of thermally bonded fabrics. To examine the role of various bonding temperatures on the fabric performance, pre-consolidated webs were formed and subsequently, thermally bonded. Thus, any influence introduced by potential variations in the structure was minimized. Point-bonded bicomponent samples made up of nylon- 6 (N 6) as the islands and low density polyethylene (PE) as the sea showed great promise with respect to their mechanical properties, suggesting that the use of bicomponent fibers can be beneficial for strength optimization of thermally bonded spunbond nonwovens...|$|E
40|$|Fiber {{spinning}} of anionic TEMPO-oxidized cellulose (TOCN) nanofibrils with polycations by interfacial polyelectrolyte complexation is demonstrated. The formed fibers {{were mostly}} composed of cellulose nanofibrils and the polycations were a minor constituent, leading to yield and ultimate strengths of ca. 100 MPa and ca. 200 MPa, and Young’s modulus of ca. 15 GPa. Stretching of the as-formed wet filaments of TOCN/polycation by 20 % increased the Young’s modulus, yield strength, and {{ultimate tensile strength}} by approximately 45, 36, and 26 %, respectively. Importantly, feasibility of compartmentalized wound bicomponent fibers by simultaneous spinning of two fibers of different compositions and entwining them together was shown. This possibility was further exploited to demonstrate reversible shape change of a <b>bicomponent</b> <b>fiber</b> directly by humidity change, and indirectly by temperature changes based on thermally dependent humidity absorption. The demonstrated route for TOCN-based fiber preparation is expected to open up new avenues {{in the application of}} nanocelluloses in advanced fibrous materials, crimping, and responsive smart textiles.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{application}} of alkaline hydrolysis {{to study the}} change in the fine structure of bicomponent polyester fibers as their surface is removed progressively was explored. The samples were prepared with a poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) sheath and a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) core. The reagent used to hydrolyze the PBT was 1 M NaOH in 75 / 25 methanol to water since it appeared to react topochemically with the fiber. The solution reacted more rapidly with PET than with PBT. Thus, when necessary to retard the weight loss of the bicomponent fibers, after a 2 -h hydrolysis with this reagent to remove PBT, it was replaced with aqueous 1 M NaOH solution contain-ing 0. 1 % cetrimmonium bromide. Unlike homofil PET or PBT fibers, where alkaline attack appeared to be confined to the surface and left the residue relatively smooth, the <b>bicomponent</b> <b>fiber</b> was attacked unevenly, and penetration to the PET core occurred before all the PBT at the surface was removed. Nevertheless, most of the reaction was confined initially to the PBT sheath. The tenacity and extension at break of the PBT–PET fiber passed through a maximum as hydrolysis progressed. The fall in tenacity at high weight losses is ascribed to increasing surface defects in the fibe...|$|E
40|$|When poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) {{is to be}} used as a {{piezoelectric}} material, {{the processing}} must include the formation of polar beta-phase crystallites, as well as the application of electrically conducting charge collectors, that is, electrodes. In this article, results from the melt spinning of PVDF yarns and a novel bicomponent PVDF-yarn with a conductive carbon black/polypropylene (CB/PP) core are presented. Melt spinning has been done under conditions typical for industrial large-scale fiber production. The effects on the resulting crystalline structure of varying the spinning velocity, draw rate, and draw temperature are discussed. The results show that, for maximum alpha-to-beta phase transformation, cold drawing should take place at a temperature between 70 and 90 degrees C, and both the draw ratio and the draw rate should be as high as possible. It was observed that the cold drawing necessary to form beta-phase crystallinity simultaneously leads to a decrease in the core conductivity of the bicomponent yarns. In this work, the melt spinning of <b>bicomponent</b> <b>fibers</b> with high-beta-phase PVDF in the sheath and a CB/PP core was successfully accomplished. The core material remained electrically conductive, paving the way for the use of a CB-polymer compound as inner electrode in the melt spinning of piezoelectric <b>bicomponent</b> <b>fibers...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{explains the}} melt spinning of <b>bicomponent</b> <b>fibers,</b> {{consisting of a}} conductive polypropylene (PP) core and a piezoelectric sheath (polyvinylidene fluoride). Previously analyzed piezoelectric capabilities of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) are to be exploited in sensor filaments. The PP compound contains a 10 wt % carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and 2 wt % sodium stearate (NaSt). The sodium stearate is added to lower the viscosity of the melt. The compound constitutes the fiber core that is conductive due to a percolation CNT network. The PVDF sheath’s piezoelectric effect {{is based on the}} formation of an all-trans conformation β phase, caused by draw-winding of the fibers. The core and sheath materials, as well as the <b>bicomponent</b> <b>fibers,</b> are characterized through different analytical methods. These include wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) to analyze crucial parameters {{for the development of a}} crystalline β phase. The distribution of CNTs in the polymer matrix, which affects the conductivity of the core, was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Thermal characterization is carried out by conventional differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Optical microscopy is used to determine the fibers’ diameter regularity (core and sheath). The materials’ viscosity is determined by rheometry. Eventually, an LCR tester is used to determine the core’s specific resistance...|$|R
40|$|Bicomponent electrospun nanofibers {{based on}} the {{combination}} of synthetic (i. e., aliphatic polyesters such as polycaprolactone (PCL)) and natural proteins (i. e., gelatin) have been extensively investigated as temporary platforms to instruct cells by the release of molecular/pharmaceutical signals for the regeneration of several tissues. Here, water soluble proteins (i. e., gelatin), strictly embedded to PCL, act as carriers of bioactive molecules, thus improving bioavailability and supporting cell activities during in vitro regeneration. However, these proteins are rapidly digested by enzymes, locally produced by many different cell types, both in vitro and in vivo, with significant drawbacks in the control of molecular release. Hence, we have investigated three post-processing strategies {{based on the}} use of different crosslinking agents—(1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride) (EDC), glyceraldehyde (GC), and 1, 4 -butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDGE) —to delay the dissolution time of gelatin macromolecules from <b>bicomponent</b> <b>fibers.</b> All of the qualitative (i. e., SEM, TGA) and quantitative (i. e., Trinitrobenzene sulfonate (TNBS) and bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assays) morphological/chemical analyses as well as biocompatibility assays indicate that EDC crosslinking improves the chemical stability of <b>bicomponent</b> <b>fibers</b> at 37 °C and provides a more efficient encapsulation and controlled sustained release of drug, thus resulting in the best post-treatment to design bio-inspired fibrous platforms for the extended in vitro release of drugs...|$|R
40|$|Bico fibers include {{bicomponent}} and biconstituent fibers. Bicomponent fibers are synthetic fibers {{made from}} two polymers of different chemical and physical structure. They {{are produced by}} common melt-drawing processes similar to conventional synthetic fibers. [1]. The biconstituent fiber consists of a continuous matrix of one polymer in which a different fiber-forming polymer is dispersed as a second distinct discontinuous phase; it as mix-polymer fiber or fascicular microfiber because the microfibers are connected {{to each other and}} can’t function independently from each other. [2]. Among bicomponent fibers, the bicomponent microfiber is different from the core-sheath type of <b>bicomponent</b> <b>fiber.</b> In theory bico fibers can be made from many polymers but in fact, they are made frequently from CoPET/PA because of cost factors. The core-sheath bico fiber, including such varieties as PE/PP, PE/PET and CoPET/PET are used as bonding fibers for hygiene and medical nonwovens. A cross-sectional morphology of bicomponent fibers can be classified into four main types:”core-sheath”,”side-by-side”,”pie-wedge” and “islands in the sea”. The core-sheath and side-by-side bicomponent fibres are the basic structures of bicomponent fibres. Methods for the preparation of more complex bicomponent nanofibres such as island-in-the-sea and pie-wedges have yet to be developed. This four basic configurations can be adapted in function of the desired fibre or yarn properties. It is for exemple possible {{to limit the number of}} islands to produce conductive yarns. On the other hand it is possible to provide a hole in the pie-wedge configuration to split the filaments even more easily. The newly created bicomponent fibre have new properties and can be applied in many new applications. Bicomponent fibres are actually being applied in the production of : microfibres (hygiene), non-wovens, antimicrobial textiles, elastic fibres, conductive fibres and composites...|$|E

40|$|Electrospinning is {{a simple}} and {{versatile}} method to produce fibers using charged polymer solutions. As drug delivery systems, electrospun fibers are an excellent choice because of easy drug entrapment, high surface area, morphology control and biomimetic characteristics. Various drugs and biomolecules can be easily encapsulated inside or on fiber surface either during electrospinning or through post-processing of the fibers. Multicomponent fibers have attracted special attention because new properties and morphologies can be easily obtained through the combination of different polymers. The factors that affect the drug release such as construct geometry and thickness, diameter and porosity, composition, crystallinity, swelling capacity, drug loading, drug state, drug molecular weight, drug solubility in the release medium, drug–polymer–electrospinning solvent interactions are discussed.

40|$|<b>Bicomponent</b> <b>fibers</b> of two semi-crystalline (co) polymers, poly(ɛ-caprolactone), and poly(oxyethylene-b-oxypropylene-b-oxyethylene), were {{obtained}} by electrospinning. Acetazolamide and timolol maleate were loaded in the fibers in different concentrations (below and above the drug solubility limit in polymer) {{in order to determine}} the effect of drug solubility in polymer, drug state, drug loading and fiber composition on fiber morphology, drug distribution and release kinetics. The high loadings fibers (with drug in crystalline form) showed higher burst and faster release than low drug content fibers, indicating the release was more sustained when the drug was encapsulated inside the fibers, in amorphous form. Moreover, timolol maleate was released faster than acetazolamide, indicating that drug solubility in polymer influences the partition of drug between polymer and elution medium, while fiber composition also controlled drug release. At low loadings, total release was not achieved (cumulative release percentages smaller than 100 %), suggesting that drug remained trapped in the fibers. The modeling of release data implied a three stage release mechanism: a dissolution stage, a desorption and subsequent diffusion through water-filled pores, followed by polymer degradation control...|$|R

[9] obtained nanoscale biomimetic wool fibers by electrospinning PAN and TPU using a side-by-side co-electrospinning arrangement. Chen et al. [10] utilized three kinds of co-electrospinning spinnerets to produce nanosprings from PU and Nomex. Using side-by-side electrospinning, Zhang et al.

In the above researches, the helical nanofibers obtained are described as three-dimensional and spring-like structures with nano- to microscale helix diameters. The authors attributed the generation of helical fibers {{to the fact that}} the two components involved in co-electrospinning display different shrinkages after electrospinning. But there is no detailed analysis and explanation of the formation mechanism of helical fibers. Based on the concept that an elastomeric and a stiff polymer in co-electrospinning may introduce longitudinal stress and result in coiled shapes of the <b>bicomponent</b> <b>fibers,</b> our previous studies [12] reported the fabrication of helical nanofibers via co-electrospinning. We compared three component systems, Nomex/TPU, PAN/TPU, and PS/TPU, which represent three kinds of polymer composition arrangements in co-electrospinning, and explored the role of polymer chain rigidity, miscibility, and hydrogen bonding on the formation of helical fibers. It has been experimentally verified that Nomex/TPU system can form fine helical fibers. However, Nomex is a non-hydrophilic polymer, which limited its application in biological tissue and adsorption filtration [13].|$|R
