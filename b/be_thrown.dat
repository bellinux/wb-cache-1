5|$|The writing, {{giving and}} reading of a kvitel is treated very seriously by Hasid and Rebbe alike, and is {{executed}} according to specific protocols. Because of their inherent sanctity, kvitelach may not <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> away after use; {{they are either}} burned or buried.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that swaraj {{not only can}} be attained with non-violence, it can be run with non-violence. Military is unnecessary, because any aggressor can <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> out using the method of non-violent non-co-operation. While military is unnecessary in a nation organised under swaraj principle, Gandhi added that a police force is necessary given human nature. However, the state would limit the use of weapons by the police to the minimum, aiming for their use as a restraining force.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Salukis {{were used}} for hunting by nomadic tribes. Typical quarry {{included}} the gazelle, hare, fox and jackal. While hunting hares, Bedouin hunters would sometimes ride close to their quarry on a camel holding a Saluki, which would <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> towards the prey while at speed to give the dog a running start. Gazelle hunters also used hawks to gouge out {{the eyes of the}} prey so that a Saluki could then bring down the blinded animal.|$|E

5000|$|Many tricks or {{patterns}} are generated from mixing cascade and reverse cascade throws. For example, tennis (siteswap: 3) one ball <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> over (reverse) {{while the other}} two <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> under (inside). One juggles, [...] "a cascade with two balls while the 'tennis' ball <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> {{and forth over the}} top." ...|$|R
5|$|I {{might have}} adduced for this same purpose the {{differences}} between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.|$|E
5|$|It {{seemed to}} me {{sufficient}} to indicate, in {{the first edition of}} my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth.|$|E
5|$|On 29November, {{the crew}} {{assembled}} {{to consider the}} proposal {{that some of the}} slaves should <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> overboard. James Kelsall later claimed that he had disagreed with the plan at first but it was soon unanimously agreed. On 29November, 54women and children were thrown through cabin windows into the sea. On 1December, 42male slaves were thrown overboard, and 36more followed in the next few days. Another ten, in a display of defiance at the inhumanity of the slavers, jumped into the sea. Having heard the shrieks of the victims as they were thrown into the water, one slave requested that the remaining Africans be denied all food and drink rather than <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> into the sea. The crew ignored this request. In total, 132 Africans were killed by the time the ship reached the Caribbean. The account of the King's Bench trial reports that one slave managed to climb back onto the ship.|$|E

50|$|In ancient Rome, {{executed}} criminals <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> {{into the}} Tiber. People executed at the Gemonian stairs <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> in the Tiber during the later {{part of the}} reign of the emperor Tiberius. This practice continued over the centuries. For example, the corpse of Pope Formosus <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> into the Tiber after the infamous Cadaver Synod held in 897.|$|R
50|$|Eight no-hitters <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> {{by major}} league {{pitchers}} in the 1884 season. In {{the modern era}} (since 1901), seven no-hitters <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> in 1990, 1991, 2012, and 2015.|$|R
5|$|Rope dart: The rope dart is {{a weapon}} used in Chinese martial arts. It {{consists}} of a long rope with a metal dart attached at the end. The dart can <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> as a long range weapon while the rope is used to pull the dart backwards. The first written description of the rope dart is dated from the Tang Dynasty (618 – 907 AD).|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{it is seen}} in {{the time}} of Emperor Hadrian (r.117–138 CE), the {{punishment}} for parricide was basically made optional, in that the convict might <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> into the arena instead. Furthermore, a rescript from Hadrian is preserved in the fourth century CE grammarian Dositheus Magister that contains the information that the cart with the sack and its live contents was driven by black oxen.|$|E
5|$|According to Dawlatshah, Abdollah-ibn-Tahir, an Arabicized Persian, and {{governor}} of Khorasan for the Abbasid caliphs, banned publication in Persian {{and by his}} order all the Zoroastrians were forced to bring their religious books to <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> in the fire. As a result, many literary works written in Pahlavi script disappeared. During the Abbasid reign the Zoroastrians, {{for the first time}} became a minority in Iran. Nevertheless, there were instances of toleration during the Abbasid era, particularly under the reign of Al-Mu'tasim who flogged an imam and muezzin for destroying a fire-temple and replacing it with a mosque.|$|E
50|$|A simple {{example of}} the {{discrete}} uniform distribution <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> a fair die. The possible values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and each time the die <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> {{the probability of a}} given score is 1/6. If two dice <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> and their values added, the resulting distribution is no longer uniform since not all sums have equal probability.|$|R

50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the 540 crescent, a crescent 540 is where a crescent kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> out with one leg before the 540 kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> with the other, essentially executing two separate kicks during the same motion. A slight variation of this is where the crescent kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> as a sideways snap kick, followed by a round house kick. The hips must be rotated more before the kicks <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> and the body tilts in the direction of the kicks, which can cause a person to lose their balance on the landing.|$|R
5|$|As {{the statue}} became {{an object of}} a pagan veneration, missionaries and the Bishop of Vannes Charles de Rosmadec asked Claude de Lannion, Lord of Blavet Quinipily, to destroy the statue. In 1661, Lannion ordered the statue to <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> into the Blavet river. Abundant rain {{destroyed}} the harvest soon after, which peasantry and devotees interpreted {{as an act of}} anger by their insulted idol. In 1664, the statue was drawn from the river and restored to its original location.|$|E
5|$|By 1877 it {{was clear}} that the {{situation}} had become impractical. After letters were published in The Field deriding the state of affairs it was decided to unite the kicking game under one set of laws. By this time the FA Cup had helped the FA gain a dominant position within the game. The FA accepted the Sheffield rule allowing throw-ins to <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> in any direction, as opposed to right angles only as prevails in rugby lineouts. In return the FA's use of a three-man offside was adopted.|$|E
5|$|By November 15, the Gazette claimed {{victory for}} Brooks. By the next day, {{because of the}} {{irregularities}} and votes that would <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> out, the projected winner was Baxter, by only 3,000 votes. The General Assembly met on January6 for a special joint session to declare Baxter, who by their count had received the most votes, the legal winner of the election. After a short address he was sworn in by Chief Justice John McClure. He then assumed the duties of Governor of the State of Arkansas.|$|E
50|$|In , {{the balls}} <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> underhand (palm up) and rarely they <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> {{overhand}} (palm under), and are metal. In standard , the wooden or plastic balls are tossed underhand (palm up) and rolled.|$|R
5000|$|Six no-hitters <b>were</b> <b>thrown.</b> They <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> by Ubaldo Jiménez (April 17), Dallas Braden (May 9), Roy Halladay (May 29), Edwin Jackson (June 25), Matt Garza (July 26), and Halladay again, {{this time}} in Game 1 of the NLDS. It was only {{the third time in}} major league history that at least six no-hitters <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> in a single season. Braden's no-hitter and Halladay's first were both perfect games.|$|R

5|$|Culbreth was the first-base umpire for Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Matt Garza's no-hitter {{against the}} Detroit Tigers on July 26, 2010. In the third inning, Tigers manager Jim Leyland was {{ejected from the}} game by second-base umpire Marty Foster. Garza's no-hitter was the first by a Rays pitcher. Culbreth was at second base on June 1, 2012, when New York Mets pitcher Johan Santana threw a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals. This no-hitter {{was the first to}} <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> by a Mets pitcher. Santana benefited from a close call on the third base line by umpire Adrian Johnson; the Carlos Beltrán line drive {{appeared}} to be fair, but Johnson ruled it foul.|$|E
5|$|Harold's {{body was}} {{identified}} {{the day after}} the battle, either through his armour or marks on his body. The English dead, who included some of Harold's brothers and his housecarls, were left on the battlefield. Gytha, Harold's mother, offered the victorious duke the weight of her son's body in gold for its custody, but her offer was refused. William ordered that Harold's body was to <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear. Waltham Abbey, which had been founded by Harold, later claimed that his body had been secretly buried there.|$|E
5|$|In {{relation}} {{to this group}} of works, the Commission express the opinion that an enemy {{will not attempt to}} enter Washington from this direction, and that we cannot (as a general rule) expect to be able to meet him with a line of troops. What is to be prevented is the seizure of these heights for the purpose of establishing batteries to destroy the navy-yard and arsenal. For this purpose the works should be self-sustaining, or relying only upon such aid as a small movable body of troops can furnish, and upon succor, which may <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> over the Branch after an attack is developed.|$|E
50|$|Back in the office, the {{reporter}} is desperate {{to know who}} <b>was</b> <b>throwing</b> the cream pies. Dunkfeather confesses that he <b>was</b> <b>throwing</b> the pies; however, this claim is compromised when, out of nowhere, a pie flies into his face.|$|R

5|$|In the {{original}} Final Fight, Poison and Roxy both utilized standing and acrobatic flip kicks {{to attack the}} player. As one of the fighters in Final Fight Revenge, her moveset was expanded heavily, and she was armed with a whip. The whip is used primarily in her Cat Claw and Thunder Whip attacks (which are comparable to Shoryuken/Shinryūken styled attacks, respectively), {{and can be used}} to steal a weapon from the opponent. Additionally, her handcuffs can <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> as a horizontal projectile move to immobilize the opponent for a short time.|$|E
5|$|Marko was {{associated}} with large, solitary boulders and indentations in rocks; the boulders were said to <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> by him from a hill, and the indentations were his footprints (or the hoofprints of his horse). He was also connected with geographic features such as hills, glens, cliffs, caves, rivers, brooks and groves, which he created or at which he did something memorable. They were often named after him, {{and there are many}} toponyms—from Istria in the west to Bulgaria in the east—derived from his name. In Bulgarian and Macedonian stories, Marko had an equally strong sister who competed with him in throwing boulders.|$|E
5|$|Nearing {{the end of}} the race, {{the solar}} winds {{dissipate}} and the Buccaneer pulls ahead of the Edwardian ship. Not wishing to see Wrack win, the Eternals return the TARDIS to the Doctor, allowing him to travel to the Buccaneer. However, he is captured, and Wrack's first mate suggest that the Doctor and Turlough <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> overboard. From the Edwardian ship, Tegan and the others watch as two bodies are ejected from the Buccaneer just before it crosses the finish line.|$|E
50|$|Ted Healy and his Stooges are entertainers. But because Healy is {{much more}} {{interested}} in women than he is in performing, they <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> out of the Happy Hour Theatre. Unable to keep a job anywhere else, they are reduced to waiting tables at a high-class restaurant. This, of course, ends up being a disaster as the restaurant <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> into chaos because of them. So, yet again, they <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> back out on to the streets.|$|R
5000|$|Defensive pass {{interference}} is penalized {{from the}} spot of the foul, regardless if the pass <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> or not. Previously, interference before the pass <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>was</b> a 15-yard penalty {{from the previous}} spot. This change would be repealed in the 1984 season.|$|R
