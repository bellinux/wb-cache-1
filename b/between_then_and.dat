5|$|<b>Between</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> {{the late}} 1940s these two {{estimates}} were commonly cited by reporters and the media.

5|$|In May 1909 Wodehouse {{made his}} second visit to New York, where he sold two short stories to Cosmopolitan and Collier's {{for a total}} of $500, a much higher fee than he had {{commanded}} previously. He resigned from The Globe and stayed in New York for nearly a year. He sold many more stories, but none of the American publications offered a permanent relationship and guaranteed income. Wodehouse returned to England in late 1910, rejoining The Globe and also contributing regularly to The Strand Magazine. <b>Between</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he revisited America frequently.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1941, when David Stirling was {{pitching}} his idea for a dedicated airborne commando unit (which later evolved into the Special Air Service) he obtained Clarke's support partly by promising to use the SAS name. From late 1942, Clarke used the 1st SAS in his major order of battle deception (codenamed Operation Cascade). The brigade formed part of the fictional 4th Airborne Division; <b>between</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> {{the end of the}} war it was used to mislead Axis commanders about the strength of Allied forces in North Africa, and as part of several specific tactical deceptions.|$|E

5|$|The Auxois is {{a direct}} {{descendant}} of the Bourguignon of the Middle Ages. In the 19th century, blood was added from other French draft breeds before {{the creation of a}} stud book in 1912. After the creation of the stud book, only purebred Auxois or Ardennais and Trait du Nord crosses could be registered. World War I interrupted efforts to set the breed standard, but testing resumed in 1920, and <b>between</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> World War II the Auxois was the pride of regional farmers. The breed reached its peak in the 1930s, but by the 1960s began to decline with the advent of mechanization.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine forces, under Licario's command, now (in 1272/1273) {{launched}} a campaign that took the fortresses of Larmena, La Cuppa, Clisura and Manducho. The Lombard triarchs then appealed to their liege-lord, Prince William II of Achaea, and to Dreux de Beaumont, marshal of the Angevin Kingdom of Sicily. William was able to recover La Cuppa, but de Beaumont was defeated in a pitched battle and was subsequently recalled by Charles of Anjou. <b>Between</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> 1275, according to the Venetian chronicler Marino Sanudo, Licario himself served in the Byzantine army in Asia Minor, where he scored a victory against the Turks.|$|E

In 1976, the Solomon Islands won the right to self-government from the British, and declared independence in 1978.

5|$|Aruba is a {{small island}} colony of 100,000 people {{that is part of}} the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and has been under Dutch control since the 1630s. The island lies in the {{southern}} Caribbean Sea just to north of Venezuela, and is near to the Dutch colonies of Curaçao and Bonaire. The colony originally was part of an autonomous union with those two islands in what was known as the Netherlands Antilles, but Aruba seceded from that union in 1986. The Netherlands continues to regulate all its foreign affairs. While the first Dutch Antilean delegation to the Olympics was sent during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, the first uniquely Aruban delegation participated two years after the island's secession from the Netherlands Antilles at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. <b>Between</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> the 2004 Athens Olympics, Aruba had sent a delegation to all five Summer Olympic games. The most substantial Aruban delegation was in 1988, when it included eight athletes. This delegation included more women and encompassed more sports than any Aruban delegation since then (including the Athens Olympics).|$|E
5|$|Borah {{considered}} challenging Hoover for renomination in 1932, but {{concluded the}} president's {{control over the}} party machinery, especially in the South, could not be overcome. Borah disagreed with the platform of the 1932 Republican National Convention over Prohibition; after the party passed a vague compromise plank and renominated Hoover, Borah made a major address on June 30, gaining nationwide attention by attacking his party's platform for forty minutes. <b>Between</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> November, he rarely mentioned Hoover's name publicly, though he said late in the campaign that he would vote for the president. He made speeches discussing issues, not candidates, and did nothing to aid Hoover's doomed campaign against Franklin D. Roosevelt. When some Idahoans demanded that he support Hoover on pain of being opposed for renomination for Senate in 1936, Borah responded that he regretted if his quarter century in the Senate had left them with the impression he might be moved by such an ultimatum.|$|E

5|$|Chad is a {{landlocked}} country in Africa whose northern region lies within the eastern {{reaches of the}} Sahara Desert and whose southern region lies within the eastern portion of the Sahel. It borders Libya to the south, Niger to the east, Sudan to the west, and the Central African Republic to the north. Chad was originally part of French West Africa until 1960, when it declared independence. Some four years later, the former French colony made its début at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. For the next three decades, Chad became embroiled in civil war and experienced invasions by Libya and upheavals by Sudanese-backed rebels; the civil war ended in 1990, although rebel threats had persisted <b>between</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> 2008. During Chad's greatest era of instability, athletes from the country {{did not attend the}} 1976 Summer Olympics in Montréal, Canada or the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, USSR, although delegations were sent to all other games between 1964 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|Dominica is {{an island}} nation located in the far eastern rim of the Caribbean Sea that lis between the French colonies of Guadeloupe (to the north) and Martinique to the south. The country's debut in the Olympics was in Atlanta during the 1996 Summer Olympics, and it has participated in every summer Olympics <b>between</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> the Beijing Olympics in 2008numbering four in total. The largest {{delegation}} sent by Dominica was in 1996, {{and the size of}} its delegation decreased to four in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, then to two in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Dominica's Beijing delegation also only included two athletes, although its appearance at the Olympics marked the first Dominican delegation that included no women. As of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, Dominican athletes had not won any medals. Jerome Romain, the coach accompanying the Dominican delegation, was the nation's flagbearer at the ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|During the reigns of HenryIV (1399–1413) and his {{successor}} HenryV (1413–1422), Rochester Castle was in the guardianship of William, Earl of Arundel and his brother Richard. The castle was given to HenryV's widow, Catherine of Valois, in 1423 {{as part of her}} dower to support her financially. She died in 1437, at which point the castle came under the custodianship of the clerk of the King's works. Despite this, there are no records of building work during the 15thcentury and almost nothing is known about Rochester Castle <b>between</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> {{the second half of the}} 16thcentury. The decline of the castle's military significance is marked by the leasing of the surrounding ditch, beginning in 1564 at the latest. Between 1599 and 1601 stone from Rochester Castle was reused to build nearby Upnor Castle, an artillery fort.|$|E
