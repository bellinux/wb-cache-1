This is an experimental research, using Randomized pretest-posttest control group design. The number of samples used in the treatment group and control group is 15 people respectively.

Based on the results of t test analysis on Kartisol variables, there were significant differences between treatment group and control group with p = 0. 002 (p < 0. 05). In this Kartisol variables, there was also reduction in treatment groups of 4. 77 ng/ml and 0. 83 ng/ml in the control group. The difference was due to <b>breathing</b> <b>exercise</b> treatment using breath control and dhikr so that psychologically treatment group will be more calm, relaxed compared to the control group. Thus <b>breathing</b> <b>exercise</b> {{can be one of the}} cheap, effective alternative exercise to reduce stress hormone levels (Kartisol). With relatively low levels of Kartisol, it will provide an opportunity for lymphocytes T to produce interleukin 2 (Th 1) and interleukin 4 (Th 2).

40|$|Background: Blood {{pressure}} {{is a vital}} factor in human body circulation system. Hypertension is primarily risk factor of cardiovascular diseases which is the highest {{cause of death in}} Indonesia.

Research method: Method used in this research is quasi experimental. The whole respondent population in this research is 31 people, where 18 people were from posyandu lansia Anggrek and 13 people were from posyandu lansia Bagas Waras with age range 50 - 70 years old. Sample of this research is taken using Total Sampling. The result of the research: From the Wilcoxon test statistical measurement, it is acquired that there is a blood pressure reduction both systolic and diastolic after Deep <b>Breathing</b> <b>Exercise</b> was given. While respondents who were given foot reflexology massage therapy did not experience blood pressure reduction especially diastolic. After that it was performed different effect test of Man Whitney test, where it is acquired significant result 0. 001, thus, because significant p < 0. 05 (0. 001). Then Ho is rejected and Ha is accepted on Deep <b>Breathing</b> <b>Exercise</b> and foot reflexology massage therapy on blood pressure reduction systolic. While it is acquired significant result 0. 030, because it is significant p < 0. 05 (0. 030), then Ha is accepted and Ho is rejected. It means that there is an effect of Deep <b>Breathing</b> <b>Exercise</b> and foot reflexology massage therapy in reducing diastolic blood pressure on primarily hypertensive elderly patient. Conclusion: Then, the conclusion is {{there is a difference between}} foot reflexology massage therapeutic giving that can reduce systolic blood pressure but cannot reduce diastolic blood pressure, while Deep <b>Breathing</b> <b>Exercise</b> giving can reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
