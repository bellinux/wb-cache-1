50|$|OzWin {{was born}} out of the earlier OzCIS program which was DOS based. OzWin allowed users to connect to CompuServe forums and batch {{download}} messages, files, and so forth from the server and then disconnect. They could then read the messages offline, and as well compose new messages and replies while offline. When they finished reading and composing messages, they could connect again to <b>batch</b> <b>send</b> all of the messages, as well as receive any new messages others had posted to the forums. This allowed users to batch upload and download messages and then work offline, minimising the time they were connected to CompuServe. This was important, since at that time, users were charged by the hour to connect to CompuServe, so remaining connected all the time was an expensive proposition and could quickly run up charges.|$|E
40|$|Mobile money {{transfer}} is {{among some of}} the fastest growing sectors in Information. It provides openness to all mobile service providers; any user from any mobile service provider is able to use the solution. It allows for <b>batch</b> <b>sending</b> of money to a group of Technology today. With its continued usage, come new challenges that need to be addressed. Among some of those challenges include the need for a mobile money transfer service that allows transfer of money across all mobile service providers, provide a link to a customer’s other electronic sources of money and also allow the user to push money to a group of people with a single transaction. Nexcash is proposed as a platform that allows for the transfer of funds across various network service providers efficiently and effectively using a mobile phone. It provides a link between the user’s mobile accounts to other electronic sources of money that they have, particularly banks. It also allows <b>batch</b> <b>sending</b> of money. Among some of the functionalities it has include: sending of money to either an individual or a group, withdrawal of money from Nexcash accounts, deposit of money to Nexcash account, transfer of money to user’s different accounts. Nexcash runs on Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) networks. The user interacts with the application using their mobile phones, to which transaction menus are forwarded by the application depending on some key-word that the user sends to the application. Nexcash brings in four new benefits into the money transfer solutions industries. It provides link to a user’s bank accounts which allows a user to perform transactions in their bank accounts using their mobile phones. It provides standardized transaction charges regardless of the mobile service provider that your SIM card is subscribed to...|$|R

[...] "A long time, I am afraid; for there are scores of Russian {{officers}} prisoners with us, and I don't think there are {{half a dozen of}} ours captured by the Russians. Of course, no exchange can take place until there are a good <b>batch</b> to <b>send</b> over, and, it may be, months may pass before they happen to lay hands on enough Swedish officers to make it worth while to trouble about exchanging them." ...|$|R

This network topology allows for adding extra layers of fan-in as a system grows, and <b>batching</b> messages before <b>sending</b> them between datacenters, without having any code that explicitly needs to understand datacenter topology, only a simple configuration.|$|R
50|$|However, Film Ferrania {{suffered}} numerous production delays due to asbestos discoveries, {{and numerous}} infrastructural issues. In late 2015, FILM Ferrania CEO Baldini told German magazine Cine 8-16 {{that the new}} time schedule was to start the first test <b>batch</b> to <b>send</b> to donators by spring 2016, which will include a line of color reversal films based on ScotchChrome in the ISO speeds and color balances of 64D, 100D, 200D, 400D, 640T, and 800/3200T, in the formats of 135 and 120 for still photography, as well as Super8 and 16mm. Later, a negative line based on the Solaris stock will follow in speeds of 100, 200 and 400 ISO.|$|R
40|$|Batch {{services}} {{are a new}} approach to distributed computation in which clients <b>send</b> <b>batches</b> of operations for execution on a server and receive hierarchical results sets in response. In this paper we show how batch services provide a simple and powerful interface to relational databases, with support for arbitrary nested queries and bulk updates. One important property of the system is that a single batch statement always generates a constant number of SQL queries, no matter how many nested loops are used. ...|$|R

[...] Saleen had ordered a batch of Explorers in 1998 for {{transformation}} into a XP8, however, some six cylinder Explorer XLT's were thrown into the <b>batch.</b> Rather than <b>send</b> the Explorers back for an exchange, which would result in lost time and money for Saleen, they decided to outfit the six cylinder Explorer XLT's instead with the XP8 package. Thus, the XP6 was born.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} pace {{was still}} not fast enough for some, in particular Howard. And so after the 4.1.6 release in May 2003 the code repository was branched into a [...] "4.1" [...] legacy branch, to satisfy the conservative elements, and a [...] "4.2" [...] development branch to satisfy Howard. The development branch then began the largest period of code work since before Leffler released 4.0pl0. The Class 1 driver was endowed with ECM capability, fax <b>batching</b> support (<b>sending</b> multiple faxes in one call) was added, extended resolution support began, MMR and JBIG data compressions were supported, and color fax reception was supported all {{in a relatively short}} amount of time. This set of developments, and the subsequent stabilization of those features, made HylaFAX not only the best, most feature-rich open-source fax software available, but it also became easily the most feature-rich fax software of any kind that supported average, inexpensive off-the-shelf fax modems.|$|R
30|$|OpenNebula [80] is an {{open source}} toolkit for {{building}} IaaS clouds which includes a monitoring system [81],[82]. OpenNebula manages the VM lifecycle {{in a manner similar}} to cloudinit.d, it bootstraps the VM with the necessary monitoring agent and small scripts called probes via SSH. OpenNebula has two configurations: pull and push. The push model is the preferred mode of operation. In this configuration the OpenNebula monitoring agent collects resource metrics and transmits them to the OpenNebula front end via UDP. The front end operates a collection daemon which receives monitoring state and periodically <b>sends</b> <b>batches</b> to oned, the OpenNebula core daemon. If, due to support issues, the push model is unavailable OpenNebula defaults to a pull model, similar to Nagios, whereby oned initiates an SSH connection on each monitored VM, executes the probes and pulls the results to the front end. Visualisation and alerts can then be generated by the OpenNebula web front end. OpenNebula’s monitoring system is not particularly novel but is one of the few examples of an open source monitoring system which is embedded within a cloud infrastructure.|$|R
40|$|Male {{infertility}} {{is typically}} diagnosed upon routine semen analysis following the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) semen analysis manual. Recent {{editions of the}} manual have essentially changed the diagnosis of a semen sample, prompting debate between experts as to which edition should be followed. Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) integrity analysis {{is proving to be}} a useful adjunct to semen analysis as 15 % of infertile men have a normal semen analysis but they have an increased DNA fragmentation level (DFL) which has been associated with increased disease incidence in any resultant offspring. However, such tests are not endorsed by the WHO, possibly {{due to a lack of}} standardisation in the implementation, analysis and clinical interpretation of methods used to evaluate DNA integrity. Improved efficiency of testing is achieved by <b>batch</b> testing or <b>sending</b> samples to a central laboratory for analysis, requiring an effective storage system. Most current protocols for semen storage and related DNA integrity testing are complex, expensive and require specialised equipment. Nevertheless, since the Halosperm® G 2 Kit, requires only standard laboratory equipment, a simple, convenient and stable storage method for the purpose of testing sperm DNA fragmentation would be advantageous. DNA has been successfully extracted from air‐dried semen and one particular study has investigated the use of air‐dried semen slides as a method of storage prior to DNA fragmentation testing, however, the effects of time and temperature on the integrity of spermatozoa DNA has not been considered. The first objective of this present study was to investigate the relationship between sperm DNA fragmentation (using the Halosperm® G 2 Test Kit) and semen analysis results (measured according to the 4 th and 5 th Edition WHO semenanalysis manuals) to determine the clinical utility of the Halosperm assay. The second objective was to consider extrinsic effects on the DNA integrity of air‐dried semen in order to develop an alternative storage method for semen prior to DNA fragmentation testing using the Halosperm assay. A retrospective analysis was carried out on 905 consecutive semen samples with 4 th and 5 th Edition semen analysis and Halosperm result. Pearson correlations, analysis by ANOVA and post‐hoc testing by Tukey’s HSD were used for statistical analysis. Multiple aliquots of semen samples were prepared to achieve fresh, snap frozen and air‐dried samples. Samples were sequentially assessed for sperm DNA fragmentation using the Halosperm® G 2 kit (Halotech DNA SL, Spain) and scored against 300 sperm, with fragmentation results ≥ 30 % considered positive. Fragmentation levels were compared between the different protocols. Multiple aliquots of semen samples were then air‐dried to test the fragmentation levels between different slide types, reconstituting fluids, times and temperatures. Pearson’s correlation coefficient and paired t‐tests were used for statistical analysis. In summary, whilst significant associations exist between sperm DNA fragmentation and sexual abstinence, volume of the ejaculate, sperm concentration, normal sperm morphology and sperm motility, the Halosperm assay may provide an explanation for infertility where semen analysis cannot. Furthermore, air‐drying semen is a simple and stable storage method, for up to one month at ‐ 22 degrees, prior to DNA fragmentation testing with the Halosperm® G 2 kit...|$|R
