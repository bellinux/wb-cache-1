Nanophase separation in the networks prepared has not been found by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). On the other hand, nanophase separated structure of the hydrogels has been revealed by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). SANS data were fitted well using Teubner-Strey model based on the locally lamellar structure of water-rich and water-poor nanodomains and values of model parameters are determined.

Molecular ions in the mass spectra that characterized the curing reactions steps, including blocking, coupling, branching, and crosslinking, were identified. The aliphatic hydrocarbon ions were correlated to the curing reaction rate, and this indicated that coupling and branching occurred much faster than the blocking and crosslinking curing reactions steps. The total conversion of the coupling and branching reaction steps were followed on the basis of changes with time in the relative ion intensity of molecular ions assigned to the DGEBA/DGEBF, aliphatic hydrocarbon, epoxide, and aromatic ring structures. Indicative measures of crosslinking density were monitored through the observation of changes in the ratio of the relative intensities of the aliphatic hydrocarbon and hydroxyl molecular ions over time.

It {{was found that}} the curing reaction of BCE were accelerated by OMPS, and the onset temperature of the cyclotrimerization was reduced up to 95. 5 °C (by DSC). As demonstrated by DSC and FT-IR, there was no evidence indicated the co-reaction between maleimide and cyanate ester. 2, 2 ’-diallyl <b>bisphenol</b> <b>A</b> (DBA) and <b>diglycidyl</b> <b>ether</b> of <b>bisphenol</b> <b>A</b> (E- 51) were also used to enhance the toughness of BT resins, and the formulated BTA and BTE resins were obtained. The results of DMA and TG show that the BT, BTA, and BTE resins containing 1 wt % of OMPS exhibit enhanced thermal properties in comparison with pristine BT 0, BTA 0, and BTE 0 resins, while more content of OMPS may impair the polymer matrix, though the effect of OMPS was slight. The dielectric constant of these hybrid materials were reduced by incorporation of OMPS, while overmuch contents of OMPS were disadvantageous for dielectric constant due to the aggregation of OMPS...|$|R
50|$|N-Terminal domain AR {{antagonist}}s are a {{new type}} of AR antagonist which, unlike all currently marketed AR antagonists, bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the AR rather than the ligand-binding domain (LBD). Whereas conventional AR antagonists bind to the LBD of the AR and competitively displace androgens, thereby preventing them from activating the receptor, AR NTD antagonists bind covalently to the NTD of the AR and prevent protein-protein interactions subsequent to activation that are required for transcriptional activity. As such, they are non-competitive and irreversible antagonists of the AR. Examples of AR NTD antagonists include <b>bisphenol</b> <b>A</b> <b>diglycidyl</b> <b>ether</b> (BADGE) and its derivatives EPI-001 and EPI-506. These drugs are currently under development for the treatment of prostate cancer, and it is thought that they may have greater efficacy as antiandrogens relative to conventional AR antagonists. In accordance with this notion, AR NTD antagonists are active against splice variants of the AR, which conventional AR antagonists are not, and AR NTD antagonists are immune to gain-of-function mutations in the AR LBD that convert AR antagonists into AR agonists and which commonly occur in prostate cancer.|$|E

40|$|Characterization of {{crosslinked}} polymers {{remains one}} of the challenging problems in polymer science. This dissertation describes a quantitative methodology developed to probe cure reactions in network polymers. The approach is based on a reactive dye labeling technique in which azochromophoric dye mimics the curing agent and its absorption and emission behavior provide information on the curing process. ^ In epoxies, p,p'-diaminoazobenzene (DAA) is used to mimic the behavior of diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS). The epoxy systems investigated include two diepoxides, <b>diglycidyl</b> <b>ether</b> of <b>bisphenol</b> <b>A</b> (DGEBA) and <b>diglycidyl</b> <b>ether</b> of butanediol (DGEB); and a tetraepoxide, tetraglycidyl diphenyl methane (TGDDM). All of these were cured with DDS. As the polymer is cured, the λ max of the π to π* transition corresponding to the azo bond of DAA red-shifts in a way that provides spectral discrimination of the cure products (cross-linkers, branch points, linear chains, chain ends and unreacted diamines). We quantified the products, determined the kinetic parameters, and made some structure-property correlations. Distinction of the cure species has not been possible before and the results obtained give us insight into the cure mechanism. Fluorescence due to the DAA label increases sharply due to the increasing fluorescence quantum yield of the cure products rather than due to viscosity changes. Thus fluorescence intensity was used to estimate cure composition based on the kinetic differential equations. ^ The kinetics and mechanisms of thermal imidization of polyamic acid made from a conjugated diamine (DAA) and a non-conjugated dianhydride (6 F-DA) were investigated both in dilute solution and in solid state. We quantified the products, obtained kinetic parameters, and proposed a much better defined mechanism for the solid film and dilute solution reactions. If degradation is assumed negligible, then dilute solution results are adequately modeled by assuming a first-order, two-step imidization reaction. On the other hand, solid film results seem to be reasonably simulated by assuming a second order reaction for the first step, followed by a first-order reaction for the second step to account for the decrease in the concentration of the conformationally favorable catalytic amic acid group. ...|$|R
