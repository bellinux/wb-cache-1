50|$|The {{following}} cladogram {{shows the}} most likely evolutionary relationships between the <b>butterfly</b> <b>kingfish</b> and the tunas, mackerels, Spanish mackerels, and bonitos.|$|E
50|$|Scombrini, {{commonly}} called the true mackerels, is a tribe of ray-finned bony fishes in the mackerel family, Scombridae - a family it shares with the Spanish mackerel, tuna and bonito tribes, plus the <b>butterfly</b> <b>kingfish.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Scombrinae are a {{subfamily}} of ray-finned {{bony fishes}} {{in the family}} Scombridae. [...] Of the 51 species in the Scombridae, 50 are in Scombrinae - with the sole exception being the <b>butterfly</b> <b>kingfish,</b> which {{is placed in the}} monospecific subfamily Gasterochismatinae.|$|E
50|$|The Scombridae {{family of}} the mackerels, tunas, and bonitos {{includes}} {{many of the most}} important and familiar food fishes. The family consists of 51 species in 15 genera and two subfamilies. All species are in the subfamily Scombrinae, except the <b>butterfly</b> <b>kingfish,</b> which is the sole member of subfamily Gasterochismatinae.|$|E
50|$|Scomberomorini is a {{tribe of}} ray-finned {{saltwater}} bony fishes that is {{commonly known as}} the Spanish mackerels or seerfishes. This tribe is a subset of the mackerel family (Scombridae) - a family that it shares with three sister tribes, the tunas, mackerels, and bonitos, and the <b>butterfly</b> <b>kingfish.</b> Scomberomorini comprises 21 species across three genera.|$|E
5000|$|Bonitos are a {{tribe of}} medium-sized, ray-finned predatory {{fish in the}} family Scombridae - a family it shares with the {{mackerel}}, tuna, and Spanish mackerel tribes, and also the <b>butterfly</b> <b>kingfish.</b> [...] Also called the Sardini tribe, it consists of eight species across four genera; three of those four genera are monotypic, having a single species each.|$|E
50|$|The <b>butterfly</b> <b>kingfish</b> (Gasterochisma melampus) is an ocean-dwelling ray-finned bony {{fish in the}} {{mackerel}} family, Scombridae - {{a family}} which it shares with the tunas, mackerels, Spanish mackerels, and bonitos. Unlike the 50 species from those four tribes, however, this species is unique {{in that it is}} the only scombrid to be classified apart from the rest, into the subfamily Gasterochismatinae and genus Gasterochisma.|$|E
5000|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{lineage of}} the <b>butterfly</b> <b>kingfish</b> is more primitive and {{quite different from}} that of the rest of the scombrids. Additionally, the morphology of this species is substantially {{different from that of}} the others - some suggest that it might belong in a different family altogether. [...] At present, however, morphology and nuclear phylogeny provide support that Gasterochisma is the basal scombrid, and that both its genus, Gasterochisma, and its subfamily, Gasterochismatinae, remain as monotypic taxa under the family Scombridae.|$|E
5000|$|The juveniles of the <b>butterfly</b> <b>kingfish</b> are {{characterized}} by enormous pelvic fins that are longer than the length of its head, and that become more proportional as the fish grows. At any size, the pelvic fin tucks into a deep ventral groove, {{in much the same}} way as the first dorsal spines do in all scombrids. This species has very large cycloid scales, below which is a thick layer of fat. The swim bladder has two anterior projections that extend into the back of the skull, near the inner ear. [...] This fish lacks the median keel on the caudal peduncle - it only has the characteristic pair of small keels on each side of the base of the caudal fin, as do other scombrids. It has 21 precaudal vertebrae, plus 23 caudal vertebrae.|$|E
