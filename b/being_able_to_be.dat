5|$|Peter, Joe, Cleveland, and Quagmire win {{a costume}} contest as {{characters}} from The A-Team (because {{they had an}} actual black guy as B. A. Baracus and the other team had a Jewish man for the same role). The four men find Brian, {{who is writing a}} report for the local newspaper. When Peter and his friends win the costume contest, Brian writes a report about it, and is later telephoned by a member of The New Yorker, who tell him they would like him to work for their magazine. Brian is initially given a warm welcome by the staff, but he is immediately fired after he informs them he never graduated from college. Meanwhile, disappointed at no longer <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> The A-Team, Peter decides to become an unofficial A-Team alongside Joe, Cleveland, and Quagmire, and decide to help their local community. Peter designs a replica of the van used by The A-Team.|$|E

Conan uses the ball to {{generate}} pressure differences to ensure the rock would explode, and goes along the water stream with the last painting. He falls unconscious {{for a brief moment}} before <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> resurface <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rescued by Kogoro.|$|R
25|$|Arrangements of {{millions}} of tiles have been made that have taken many minutes, even hours to fall. For large and elaborate arrangements, special blockages (also known as firebreaks) are employed at regular distances to prevent a premature toppling from undoing more than {{a section of the}} dominoes while still <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> removed without damage.|$|E
25|$|A model rocket {{is a small}} rocket that is {{commonly}} advertised as <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> launched by anybody, to generally low altitudes, usually to around 300–1500 feet, and recovered {{by a variety of}} means. Popular among children and amateurs, model rocketry is considered a hobby. In 1954, licensed pyrotechnics expert Orville Carlisle along with his brother Robert, designed the first model rocket and model rocket motor.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Brinker's {{operation}} is successful, {{and he is}} restored to health and memory. Dr. Boekman is also changed, losing his gruff ways, {{thanks in part to}} <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reunited with his lost son through the unlikely aid of Mr. Brinker. The Brinkers' fortunes are changed further by the almost miraculous recovery of Mr. Brinker's savings, which had been thought lost or stolen ten years ago.|$|E
50|$|The modals can and could, {{in their}} {{meanings}} expressing ability, {{can be replaced}} by am/is/are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> and was/were <b>able</b> <b>to.</b> Additional forms can thus be supplied: the infinitive (<b>to)</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to,</b> the subjunctive and (rarely) imperative <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to,</b> and the participles <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> and <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to.</b>|$|R

25|$|The combat {{phase is}} split into four steps. It {{represents}} {{a point in}} the magical duel where the active player sends his or her creatures to attack the opposing player, in the hopes of doing damage to the player or the player's creatures.

25|$|The 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix indeed did adopt a late {{afternoon}} start (17:00 local time, 09:00 UTC). However this proved disastrous due to heavy rainfall causing {{the race to}} be red-flagged and not <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> restarted due to the low light level making it through the clouds. The race ended on lap 33, and with the regulations requiring 42 laps for full points, both driver and constructor results were halved in relation to points.|$|E
25|$|In 1856–57, Karl August von Steinheil and Léon Foucault {{introduced}} {{a process of}} depositing a layer of silver on glass telescope mirrors. The silver layer was not only much more reflective and longer lasting than the finish on speculum mirrors, it {{had the advantage of}} <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> removed and re-deposited without changing the shape of the glass substrate. Towards the end of the 19th century very large silver on glass mirror reflecting telescopes were built.|$|E

In this configuration the aircraft proved to be stable in pitch, <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> flown hands-off during aero-tow, and pitch could be controlled simply by the pilot leaning forwards or backwards to adjust the centre of gravity. Lateral stability was noted to be poor to fair but acceptable and the aircraft was safe and capable of flying simple aerobatics.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the war the Qing army {{consisted}} of over 200,000 soldiers, with around 800,000 men <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> called for war. These forces consisted of Manchu Bannermen, the Green Standard Army, provincial militias, and imperial garrisons. The Qing armies were armed with matchlocks and shotguns, which had an effective range of 100metres. Chinese historians estimate 30–40% of the Qing forces were armed with firearms. Chinese soldiers were also equipped with halberds, spears, swords, and crossbows. The Qing dynasty also employed large batteries of artillery in battle.|$|E

50|$|Fisher's {{principle}} {{is rooted in}} the concept of frequency-dependent selection, though Fisher's {{principle is}} not frequency-dependent selection per se. Frequency-dependent selection, in this scenario, is the logic that the probability of an individual <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> breed <b>is</b> dependent on the frequency of the opposite sex in relation to its own sex. It was first described by Darwin in 1871.|$|R

25|$|Federation Commander: Orion Attack {{returned}} to near the standard product format with 15 ships and a monster {{as well as}} counters for ships which appeared in several earlier products like the Briefing #1 and Booster Zero but contains no new map features. The pack concentrated on the operations and opponents of the Orion Pirates, a faction which have been seen since the original Klingon Border. Orion ships are unique in possessing a stealth coating making them harder to hit and in <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> customised with weapons belonging to any other race (with a few exceptions).|$|E
25|$|Though the Animorphs {{can assume}} {{the form of}} any animal they touch, there are several {{limitations}} to the ability. The most vital {{is that they can}} stay in animal form for a maximum of two hours, otherwise they will be unable to return to human form. Others include having to de-morph back to human in between morphs, only tight clothing <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carried over with a morph, and having to consistently maintain concentration during a morph to prevent the animal's natural instincts from overwhelming the human intellect. A benefit to morphing is that it allows the team to heal any superficial, non-genetic injury, sustained as a human or in a morph. Also, while in morph, they can telepathically communicate with anyone nearby.|$|E
25|$|Special {{reconnaissance}} {{units of}} the marine corps were deployed against insurgents during the 2014 War in Donbass. Oleksandr Zinchenko of the 73rd marine spetsnaz detachment was the first Ukrainian Marine killed during the War in Donbass. The Ukrainian Marine Corps was particularly hard hit by the Crimea Crisis as all of their forces except for the 73rd spetsnaz detachment were stationed on the peninsula, due to this the unit had to undergo extensive reorganization before <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> deployed {{to the war in}} the Donbass. In September 2014 Ministry of Defense announced that the marine corps were reforming from the Crimea Crisis and the remaining members of the 1st Marine Battalion which was stationed in Feodosya would take an active part in the War in Donbass. On 29 October 2014 Ukraine's Marine Corps conventional forces, recently recovered from the Crimea Crisis suffered their first casualty near Mariupol, the Marine was a Major and was killed when his unit's position came under Russian artillery fire.|$|E

500|$|The {{revival of}} team driving has {{prompted}} farmers {{who use the}} Trait du Nord to attend competitions and {{improve the quality of}} their horses. The qualities of the breed make it a popular horse for leaders in the areas of recreational and competition team driving, and the breed has the advantage of <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> immediately returned to work even after a period of inactivity for several months. When being driven, a traditional [...] "Flemish collar" [...] is generally used. The horses are trained to be driven with only one rein, leaving the driver's hands free for other work. When shown in hand, Trait du Nord horses are often presented in groups, generally between four and eight to a string.|$|E
