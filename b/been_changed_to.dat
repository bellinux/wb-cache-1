It is no longer purely a question answering (QA) computing system designed from Q pairs but can now 'see', 'hear', 'read', 'talk', 'taste', 'understand', 'reason', 'interpret', 'learn' and 'recommend'.|$|E
5|$|The {{courses of}} the rivers Parrett, Somerset Axe, Brue and Cary {{run across the}} Somerset Levels and have {{generally}} <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> improve the flow. The River Axe rises from Wookey Hole Caves, due to water draining into the ground at swallet holes {{on top of the}} Mendips. The river passes through Panborough Moor, Wedmore Moor, Ox Moor, Stoke Moor and Mark Moor and reaches the sea at Uphill (near Weston-super-Mare) on Bridgwater Bay.|$|E

M-25 was originally {{an extension of}} US25 before the latter was decommissioned in Michigan, and M-24 was once an extension of US24 before routing changes separated the two highways. M-131 was an extension of US131 until US131 was routed onto the former M-131. There was also once an M-112 that served as an alternate routing for US112 (both have since <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> I-94 and US12, respectively).|$|E

5|$|Dangerous or not, Bache {{soon began}} a lifelong crusade to win {{popularity}} for Liszt's works in England. In 1865 {{he began a}} series of annual concerts in conjunction with singer Gustave Garcia. They began modestly, in Collard's Rooms, Grosvenor Street. As they increased in popularity, they were relocated to the more spacious Beethoven Rooms in Cavendish Square, then to the Queen's Concert Rooms in Hanover Square, and finally to St. James's Hall in Regents Square. At first these concerts were of instrumental and chamber works and piano arrangements. In 1868, they had grown to include choral works, which allowed pieces such as Liszt's Soldatenlied and choruses from Wagner's Tannhäuser and Lohengrin to be programmed. By 1871, the concerts had <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> an orchestral format.|$|E

5|$|On May 30, 2017, La Máscara and Máximo made a {{surprise}} appearance, confronting {{members of the}} La Rebelión stable. The cousins were originally announced as being booked to wrestle against L.A. Park and Dr. Wagner Jr. in the main event of a Lucha Libre Boom! show, but it was later announced that the match had <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> L.A. Park vs. Dr. Wagner Jr. as Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) did not want wrestlers under contract with AAA (Wagner) to work with La Máscara and Máximo at the moment. In September, Rush and Pierroth arrived in The Crash, reuniting with La Máscara and kick starting a rivalry between Los Ingobernables and La Rebelión.|$|E
5|$|The Metroids {{the player}} fights have four main {{evolutionary}} stages – Alpha, Gamma, Zeta, and Omega – {{which have been}} altered compared to their Metroid II counterparts, including new techniques used in battle; Alpha is the least altered, having only been given a new dodge move, while Omega has been altered the most, having <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> earth-bound enemies that trap the player. The player confronts these Metroid bosses often, and has to defeat 55 of them. Among the newly added bosses are non-Metroid enemies such as a moving statue.|$|E

5|$|The fort is {{designed}} as a defensible battery, rather than a defensive strongpoint. The faces of the fort join to form a half-moon shape or lunette. The guns' primary role was to defend Port Adelaide and the Semaphore anchorage rather than the fort itself, and the design reflects this. It {{was intended to be}} supported by field artillery, cavalry and infantry for self-defence and to repel landings. While the fort retains its original form, the ditch and glacis (embankment) have been modified and are largely non-existent in some areas. Ground levels have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> accommodate paths and a caravan park, and the original western fence no longer exists.|$|E
5|$|The {{increase}} in maximum bandwidth {{is achieved by}} raising the lane speed from 6 Gbit/s to 12 Gbit/s and {{increasing the number of}} AV data lanes from 3 to 4 (i.e. using all 4 lanes to carry data). The data lanes runs in inverted clock mode and embeds the clock signal in itself. This allows the clock lane to be used for data (in addition to the existing three data lanes). The lane data structure has <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> a packet-based format. The lane encoding is changed from 8b/10b to 16b/18b (reducing the overhead from 20% to 11%).|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} the uneven bars final, in which Britain's Beth Tweddle placed 4th, was called into {{question}} after documents were found that seemed to say that Chinese gymnasts He Kexin and Yang Yilin were only 14, and therefore under the age required to compete, {{at the time of}} the games. An investigation into their ages was launched by the IOC to determine whether it was necessary to disqualify them, thus Tweddle's standing could have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> 2nd, giving her a silver medal. After a five-and-a-half-week investigation the Chinese athletes were cleared and the original results allowed to stand.|$|E
25|$|The {{highway that}} is now I-190 was signed as part of Illinois Route 194 from 1960 to 1970. In 1971, it <b>was</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> Illinois Route 594. and <b>was</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> I-190 around 1978 after the rest of Illinois 194 <b>was</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> Interstate 90 {{in the mid to}} late 1970s.|$|R
50|$|On February 2, 1854, {{the name}} of the company <b>was</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> The Marion Railroad Company.

5|$|To {{some degree}} the {{movement}} has been successful. Beginning in 1998, the official curriculum in Taiwan schools has <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> contain more frequent and favorable mention of aborigines. In 1996 the Council of Indigenous Peoples was promoted to a ministry-level rank within the Executive Yuan. The central government has taken steps to allow romanized spellings of aboriginal names on official documents, offsetting the long-held policy of forcing a Han name on an aborigine. A relaxed policy on identification now allows a child to choose their official designation if they are born to mixed aboriginal/Han parents.|$|E
5|$|At the 1963 World Championships in Stockholm, the Soviet Union won {{the gold}} medal, {{beginning}} a streak of nine consecutive World Championship golds. The 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria {{marked the first time}} that Canada failed to win an Olympic medal in hockey. The Soviet Union won all seven of their games and the gold medal, but Canada finished the tournament with five wins and two losses, putting them in a three-way tie for second place with Sweden and Czechoslovakia. Prior to 1964, the tie-breaking procedure was based on goal difference from games against teams in the medal round and under that system, Canada would have placed third ahead of the Czechoslovaks. The procedure had <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> count all games and that meant the Canadians finished fourth. However, the Olympics also counted as the World Championships, and under IIHF rules, Canada should have won a bronze. In April 2005, the IIHF admitted that a mistake had occurred and announced that they had reviewed the decision and would award the 1964 Canadian team a World Championship bronze medal. However, two months later, the IIHF over-turned their decision and rejected an appeal in September.|$|E
5|$|Following a lead, Sora, Donald, and Goofy enter a {{passageway}} through Twilight Town. There {{they encounter}} Axel, who sacrifices himself {{to create a}} passageway to the World That Never Was, the headquarters of Organization XIII, with Kingdom Hearts looming overhead as a heart-shaped moon. Sora finds Kairi and Riku, the latter of whose appearance has <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> that of Xehanort's Heartless. King Mickey encounters DiZ, who reveals himself to be the true Ansem, Xehanort's mentor. Ansem uses a device that dissipates some of Kingdom Hearts' power, but a system overload causes the device to self-destruct, both engulfing Ansem and miraculously returning Riku to his original form. At {{the top of the}} Castle That Never Was, Sora and company battle Xemnas, who uses what remains of Kingdom Hearts to power his multiple forms. After Sora and Riku destroy Xemnas, the two are reunited with their friends at their home, Destiny Islands. A post-credits scene shows Sora, Kairi and Riku read a letter from Mickey, which is hidden from the player.|$|E

The original R 1 in the top-left position <b>is</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> an interpolated R_ 1, while the interpolated R_ 4 [...] in the bottom-right position <b>is</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> the original R 4.
