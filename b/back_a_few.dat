5|$|Ghosh {{admitted}} {{in an interview}} that after his two preceding directorial ventures—Aladin and Home Delivery (2005)—performed poorly at the box office, Kahaani was his last chance to create a niche as a director. He added that the film's plot twist came somewhat accidentally. Having described the skeleton of the story to a friend during its development, the friend called him <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days later to enquire about his film. The friend had mistakenly imagined sequences which he assumed to be parts of the plot, from which the twist ending was derived.|$|E
5|$|Alongside this, Siddhu applies for a {{bank loan}} {{to start his}} {{construction}} company. When his love for Hasini deepens, he wishes to propose to her. He confesses {{to her that he}} is engaged to Subbulakshmi against his wishes, but who he really wants is her. On learning of his engagement, Hasini gets dejected, but comes <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days later and asks him to do what he wishes for and accepts his proposal. At this juncture, the ecstatic Siddhu is seen by a furious Aravind. Siddhu is admonished back home and he expresses his disinterest in marrying Subbulakshmi. When asked for his reason to like Hasini, Siddhu replies that if Hasini can stay with their family for a week, then all their questions shall be answered. He convinces Hasini to stay at his house after lying to her father, Kanaka Rao (Kota Srinivasa Rao) that she is going on a college tour.|$|E
5|$|Marge and Homer {{worry that}} Marge may be {{pregnant}} again after a home pregnancy test gives inconclusive results, so Marge drives to Dr. Hibbert's office {{to take another}} test. While waiting, Homer tells Bart, Lisa, and Maggie {{the story of how}} he and Marge got married, and Bart's birth thereafter. In 1980, Homer works at a miniature golf course and is dating Marge. One night, they make out inside of a golf course castle after seeing The Empire Strikes <b>Back.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> days later, Marge feels sick and tells Homer she might be pregnant. He takes her to the office of Dr. Hibbert, who confirms that Marge is pregnant. Homer is less than thrilled over the announcement, but since he loves Marge he proposes to her and she accepts.|$|E

5|$|New York {{was unable}} to build on their 1970 success. Tarkenton left the team's 1971 {{training}} camp in a salary dispute, before coming <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days later after signing a one-year contract. In place of a salary increase, Tarkenton had asked for a large loan to get a tax break, but the Maras turned it down, and made sure the press knew the raise and loan were denied. Johnson missed {{most of the season}} with a knee injury, and the Giants dropped to 4–10. Before the 1972 season they traded Tarkenton, who frequently feuded with Webster, back to the Vikings. Initially the trade produced positive results, as New York rallied to finish 8–6 in 1972. The 1972 team was led by veteran journeyman quarterback Norm Snead (acquired in the trade for Tarkenton), who led the league in passing and had the best season of his career. They set a still-standing team record on November 26 when they scored 62 points via eight touchdowns and two field goals. After the 1972 season however, the Giants suffered one of the worst prolonged stretches in their history. Meanwhile, Tarkenton would lead the Vikings to three Super Bowls and establish a Hall of Fame resume.|$|E
25|$|An allergy {{blood test}} is {{available}} through most laboratories. A sample of the patient's blood is sent to a laboratory for analysis, {{and the results are}} sent <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days later. Multiple allergens can be detected with a single blood sample. Allergy blood tests are very safe, since the person is not exposed to any allergens during the testing procedure.|$|E
25|$|In 1508, only 16 {{years after}} the first voyage of Christopher Columbus, Thomas Auber, who was likely part of a fishing trip near Newfoundland, brought <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> Amerindians to France. This {{indicates}} that in the early 16th century, French navigators ventured in the gulf of the St. Lawrence, along with the Basques and the Spaniards who did the same.|$|E

25|$|In {{comparison}} to later aircraft, the Vampire had a relatively disorganised cockpit {{that in some}} aspects lacked ergonomic measures; such as the fuel gauges being difficult for the pilot to observe without pulling the control column <b>back.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> controls, such as the low-pressure fuel cock, were known for being difficult to move or were otherwise obstructed by other controls. The pilot was provided with a fairly favourable external view, in part aided by the relatively small size of the Vampire.|$|E
25|$|According to his great-great-grandson, d'Alembert {{received}} him rather poorly, {{and to get}} rid of him {{gave him}} a thick mathematics book, saying to come back when he had read it. When Laplace came <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days later, d'Alembert was even less friendly and did not hide his opinion that it was impossible that Laplace could have read and understood the book. But upon questioning him, he realised that it was true, and from that time he took Laplace under his care.|$|E

25|$|Snowdrops are hardy {{herbaceous}} {{plants that}} perennate by underground bulbs. They {{are among the}} earliest spring bulbs to bloom, although a few forms of G. nivalis are autumn flowering. In colder climates, they will emerge through snow (see illustration). They naturalise relatively easily forming large drifts. These are often sterile, found near human habitation, and also former monastic sites. The leaves die <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks after the flowers have faded. Galanthus plants are relatively vigorous and may spread rapidly by forming bulb offsets. They also spread by dispersal of seed, animals disturbing bulbs, and water if disturbed by floods.|$|E
25|$|The Mall Rats {{are confronted}} by the mysterious tribe of the Chosen, led by The Guardian, that worships Zoot as a God. They kidnap Brady and Trudy to {{complete}} their Holy Trinity.

They abduct people {{and make sure the}} Mall Rats believe Ebony is behind the kidnappings. Alice and Ebony try to warn the Mall Rats, but the Chosen invade the city and take everyone prisoner in the mall.|$|E

25|$|On May 14, the Dutch {{commander}} at Rotterdam, Colonel Scharroo, {{received an}} ultimatum: {{if he did}} not surrender, the town would be bombed. As the ultimatum was not signed, Scharroo sent it <b>back.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> hours later, he received another ultimatum, this time duly signed by General Schmidt, the German commander at Rotterdam. Schmidt did not know that a squadron of bombers was already on its way to bomb Rotterdam. The Germans tried to warn the bomber crews by shooting red flares, but only half of the squadron noticed this; the other half continued on their mission and dropped their bombs on the city (see the Rotterdam Blitz).|$|E
25|$|After {{the second}} Test, Maharoof {{returned}} {{to play for}} Lancashire. Towards the end of June {{he was forced to}} miss a County Championship due to a stiff <b>back.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> days later he took his 50th T20 wicket when he dismissed Martin Guptill in Lancashire's 10-wicket win against Derbyshire, and in the process helped dismiss Derbyshire for their lowest total in the format. Maharoof was due to leave in mid-June to participate in the inaugural season of the Sri Lanka Premier League, planning to return to Lancashire in August, however the tournament was postponed until 2012. In the last match of the season, Lancashire won the County Championship {{for the first time since}} 1950 when they shared the title.|$|E
25|$|On March 19, King {{was escorted}} {{in the front}} door of the jail and let out the <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes later. King had {{arranged}} with Undersheriff Harry Woods (publisher of the Nuggett) to sell the horse he had been riding to John Dunbar, Sheriff Behan's partner in the Dexter Livery Stable. King conveniently escaped while Dunbar and Woods were making out the bill-of-sale. Woods claimed that someone had deliberately unlocked a secured back door to the jail. The Earps and the townspeople were furious at King's easy escape. Williams was later dismissed from Wells Fargo, leaving behind a number of debts, when it was determined he had been stealing from the company for years.|$|E

25|$|VanDerveer {{sent out}} resumes to twenty schools, {{looking for a}} {{graduate}} assistant job, which is an unpaid position. She only got two responses, {{one of which was}} for Ohio State, where the athletic director had remembered her from Indiana. To prepare herself, she attended a coaching clinic taught by Knight. When she had attended his practices, she had stayed out of sight, but enrolled in a class, she followed her parents advice and sat up front. One of the coaches asked if she was lost. Knight embarrassed her with one of his questions, but she didn't stop attending, although she moved <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> rows. She was hired as an assistant coach to the varsity and the head coach of the JV.|$|E
25|$|The hired hand Ray Lamphere {{was deeply}} {{in love with}} Gunness; he {{performed}} any chore for her, no matter how gruesome. He became jealous of the many men who arrived to court his employer and began making scenes. She fired him on February 3, 1908. Shortly after dispensing with Lamphere, she presented herself at the La Porte County courthouse. She declared that her former employee was not {{in his right mind}} and was a menace to the public. She somehow convinced local authorities to hold a sanity hearing. Lamphere was pronounced sane and released. Gunness was <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days later to complain to the sheriff that Lamphere had visited her farm and argued with her. She contended that he posed a threat to her family and had Lamphere arrested for trespassing.|$|E
25|$|Hill's {{performance}} at Antietam was particularly noteworthy. While Lee's army was enduring strong attacks by the Army of the Potomac outside Sharpsburg, Maryland, Hill's Light Division {{had been left}} behind to process Union prisoners at Harpers Ferry. Responding to an urgent call for assistance from Lee, Hill marched his men at a grueling pace and reached the battlefield just in time to counterattack a strong forward movement by the corps of Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside, which threatened to destroy Lee's right flank. Hill's arrival neutralized the threat, bringing an end to the battle with Lee's army battered but undefeated. Hours after the battle, Hill told an inquisitive major that Burnside owed him $8,000. During the retreat back to Virginia, he had his division push <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> regiments from the Union V Corps.|$|E
