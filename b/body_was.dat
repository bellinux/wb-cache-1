Preparations began at 10:10am local time and at-sea burial was completed at 11am. The <b>body</b> <b>was</b> washed, wrapped in a white sheet and placed in a weighted plastic bag.

40|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) <b>body</b> <b>is</b> a characteristic structure derived from ER and {{is referred to}} as a proteinase-sorting system that assists the plant cell under various stress conditions. Fluorescent ER <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> observed in transgenic plants of Arabidopsis expressing green fluorescent protein fused with an ER retention signal. ER <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> widely distributed in the epidermal cells of whole seedlings. In contrast, rosette leaves had no ER bodies. We found that wound stress induced the formation of many ER bodies in rosette leaves. ER <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> also induced by treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA), a plant hormone involved in the defense against wounding and chewing by insects. The induction of ER <b>bodies</b> <b>was</b> suppressed by ethylene. An electron microscopic analysis showed that typical ER <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> induced in the non-transgenic rosette leaves treated with MeJA. An experiment using coi 1 and etr 1 - 4 mutant plants showed that the induction of ER <b>bodies</b> <b>was</b> strictly coupled with the signal transduction of MeJA and ethylene. These results suggested that the formation of ER <b>bodies</b> <b>is</b> a novel and unique type of endomembrane system in the response of plant cells to environmental stresses. It is possible that the biological function of ER <b>bodies</b> <b>is</b> related to defense systems in higher plants...|$|R
