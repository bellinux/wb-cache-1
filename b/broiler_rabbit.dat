Reproducibility interobservers was tested: the results’ similarity correlation is 92. 74 % (3 observers and 2 farms) in pigs, and 98. 1 % (4 observers and 3 farms) in broilers. Reproducibility inter-farms is ensured: for each species, farms selected for testing were as different as possible regarding infrastructures and production methods. Technical feasibility was tested by different operators, and scientific validity was monitored until the end with bibliography and experts. By spending about one to three hours observing the animals, TIBENA gives an objective picture {{of the welfare state}} at the herd or flock level. Thanks to the clear and illustrated instructions, and the convenience of a smartphone app, anyone can use the tool and obtain a valid result. The app contains recommendations for welfare improvement. The app currently exists for pigs, <b>broilers,</b> <b>rabbits</b> and cattle, and is being developed for other farm species. During the period October 2015 -December 2016, the TIBENA app was used on 54 Terrena farms to assess welfare and provide recommendations for improvement. The longer-term goal is to make the app available to the whole industry...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was carried out at Institute Rabbit Farm of Southern Regional Research Centre, Mannavanur, Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu, India having sub-temperate climate with winter {{temperature}} during night hours going below 0 °C with an objective of finding the influence of different factors such as breed, year, season and parity on different reproductive traits of <b>broiler</b> <b>rabbits</b> in order {{to come out with}} the best strategies for improving the productivity. Materials and Methods: A total of 1793 records (946 White Giant and 847 Soviet Chinchilla) for weight at mating (WM), weight at kindling (WK), gestation length (GL), litter size at birth (LSB) and litter size at weaning (LSW), litter weight at birth (LWB), and litter weight at weaning (LWW) were collected in the period between 2000 and 2009 and the data was analyzed using general linear model option of SAS 9. 2. Results: The overall mean GL, WM, WK, LSB, LSW, LWB, and LWW were 31. 68 ± 0. 04 days, 3. 65 ± 0. 01 kg, 3. 84 ± 0. 01 kg, 6. 91 ± 0. 08, 5. 49 ± 0. 09, 387. 62 ± 4. 07 g, and 4. 66 ± 0. 07 kg, respectively. The breed has significantly influenced GL, WK, LSW, LWB, and LWW. The LSB, LSW, LWB, and LWW were 7. 05 ± 0. 11, 5. 76 ± 0. 13, 399. 55 ± 5. 88 g, and 4. 87 ± 0. 10 kg, respectively in White Giant and corresponding values for Soviet Chinchilla were 6. 78 ± 0. 11, 5. 22 ± 0. 12, 375. 91 ± 5. 64 g, and 4. 46 ± 0. 09 kg, respectively. The year of kindling had significantly affected all the reproductive traits under study and is varying over different years. The parity significantly influenced the WM, WK, and LWW. The LWW increased from first (4. 16 ± 0. 21 kg) to second parity (4. 86 ± 0. 19 kg) and remained in the same range from third parity onward. WM was significantly higher in spring season (3. 72 ± 0. 02) than the animals in rainy (3. 59 ± 0. 02) and winter season (3. 65 ± 0. 02). Better reproductive performance in terms of higher LSB, LSW, LWB, and LWW as observed in the present study might be due to conducive environmental conditions prevailing in the region. Conclusion: The significant effects of the non-genetic factors like year of kindling on all reproductive traits, season, and parity on some of the traits in rabbit breeds are indications that any future production enhancement strategy must take into consideration the environment by providing additional care, feed supplementation and better shelter management to the rabbits, so that the full genetic potential can be realized...|$|R
40|$|<b>Broiler</b> {{chicken and}} <b>rabbit</b> {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to {{study the effects of}} nickel (Ni) supplementation on growth performance and Ni metabolism. ROSS cockerels and New Zealand White female rabbits were fed a diet containing Ni in concentrations of 0, 50 and 500 mg/kg in dry matter (DM). Dietary supplementation of 50 mg Ni/kg slightly improved the body weight gain (BWG) and had a beneficial effect on the feed conversion efficiency (FCE) in broiler chickens. However, Ni added at a level of 500 mg/kg significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced the BWG by 10 % and resulted in significantly (P < 0. 05) worse (2. 3 ± 0. 2 kg/kg) FCE. The relative weight of the liver in cockerels was significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased by Ni as compared to the control group (1. 7 and 2. 1 % vs. 2. 6 %). The activity of AST and CHE enzymes was increased insignificantly by dietary supplementation of 500 mg Ni/kg, indicating damage of the liver parenchyma. The results of serum biochemistry were confirmed by a mild or moderate form of pathological focal fatty infiltration of the liver in broilers. Supplemental Ni of 50 mg/kg concentration resulted in non-significantly increased BWG in rabbits. Ni added to the diet at a level of 500 mg/kg reduced the digestibility of crude protein by 3 - 4 % and that of crude fibre by 20 - 25 % in rabbits. Approx. 98 % of the ingested Ni was lost from the body via the faeces, 0. 5 - 1. 5 % via the urine and approx. 1 % was incorporated into the organs of rabbits. As a result of dietary supplementation of 50 and 500 mg Ni/kg, Ni accumulated in the kidneys (4. 9 ± 0. 5 and 17. 1 ± 3. 1 vs. 1. 9 ± 0. 3 mg/kg DM), ribs (10. 3 ± 0. 4 and 10. 4 ± 0. 6 vs. 9. 1 ± 0. 6 mg/kg DM), heart (1. 4 ± 0. 2 and 2. 5 ± 0. 4 vs. 1. 0 ± 0. 1 mg/kg DM) and liver (1. 3 ± 0. 1 and 2. 2 ± 0. 2 vs. 0. 9 ± 0. 05 mg/kg DM), as compared to the control animals. It can be stated that supplementation of the diet with 50 mg Ni/kg had slight but non-significant beneficial effects on the growth performance of <b>broiler</b> chickens and <b>rabbits...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{apoprotein}} {{expression and}} the catalytic activities of cytochrome P 450 s {{involved in the}} biotransformation of xenobiotics were investigated in horse liver microsomes and {{compared with those of}} food producing (cattle, pigs, <b>broiler</b> chicks, and <b>rabbits)</b> and laboratory species (rats). Western blot analysis revealed the presence of proteins immunorelated to rat CYP 1 A, CYP 2 B, CYP 2 E, and CYP 3 A subfamilies in hepatic microsomes from horses and from any other examined species. With the exception of the N-demethylation of N-nitrosodimethylamine in broiler chicks, all the recorded interspecies differences were quantitative in nature. Equine preparations proved the most active in the biotransformation of the CYP 1 A substrates ethoxy- and methoxyresorufin and the least active in the metabolism of aminopyrine and ethoxycoumarin. On a comparative basis, large differences were observed in the rate of the in vitro metabolism of model substrates between "minor" (rabbits, horses) and "major" food producing species. Taken in due consideration the limitations of the in vitro approach, results from this study reinforce the conclusion that studies on drug efficacy and residue depletion should be performed in each target specie...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect on the final levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) in meat when fats, in {{particular}} fish oils, are included as ingredients in feeds. Two types of animals (<b>broilers</b> and <b>rabbits)</b> were fed with three different experimental feeds containing varying amounts of two selected fish oils. PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs were determined in the fish oils, the feeds and in the animals’ meat. For broilers, PCDD/F and DL-PCB profiles in meat samples were similar to those found in the corresponding feeds, even though bioaccumulation of the highest chlorinated PCDD/F congeners seemed to decrease. Depending on the treatment, PCDD/F and the sum of PCDD/F and DL-PCB levels were 1. 11 – 4. 60 and 6. 03 – 16. 71 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat, respectively. For most of the cases, these values exceeded the maximum established by the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1881 / 2006. In contrast, the levels of these contaminants in the corresponding feeds ranged from 0. 11 to 0. 54 pg WHO-TEQ/g, in the case of PCDD/Fs, and from 0. 59 to 1. 75 pg WHO-TEQ/g, when DL-PCBs were also included. These levels were, in general, below the maximum allowed by the Commission Directive 2006 / 13 /EC. The results of the experiments with rabbits were not as conclusive as those for broilers although bioaccumulation appeared to be slower.
