5|$|A {{number of}} traditions are upheld and {{recognised}} by choristers. Club members snap their fingers instead of clapping at each other's achievements (i.e. {{a good performance}} on a solo) <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> difficult to clap with one's music in the other hand. The club hosts a banquet every spring where awards are presented.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} mostly forages in the {{understory}} {{instead of}} the canopy. The large leaves and long branches in the understory affect its foraging behaviors. The black-throated blue warbler more often hovers rather than gleans its prey <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> difficult to glean among thick understory foliage.|$|E
5|$|The {{common eland}} is {{sometimes}} farmed and hunted for its meat, {{and in some}} cases can be better used than cattle <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> suited to African climates. This has led to some Southern African farmers switching from cattle to eland. Common elands are also pictured as supporters in the coat of arms of Grootfontein, Namibia.|$|E

5|$|While DNA {{contains}} deoxyribose, RNA contains ribose (in deoxyribose {{there is}} no hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the 2' position). These hydroxyl groups make RNA less stable than DNA <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> prone to hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|Only two {{of these}} bodies, Ceres and Pluto, have been {{observed}} in enough detail to demonstrate that they actually fit the IAU's definition. The IAU accepted Eris as a dwarf planet <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> massive than Pluto. They subsequently decided that unnamed trans-Neptunian objects with an absolute magnitude brighter than +1 (and hence a diameter of ≥838km assuming a geometric albedo of ≤1) are to be named {{under the assumption that}} they are dwarf planets.|$|E
5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} titled [...] "Ride or Die", until Def Jam renamed it [...] "Ride" [...] <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> radio-friendly.|$|R

50|$|Gregory Peck, {{comparing}} his {{performances in}} this film and the 1998 Moby Dick miniseries, said he liked the miniseries better <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> faithful to the novel.|$|R
5|$|Critics {{disagree}} with the government's justifications for introducing the GRC scheme, noting {{that the proportion of}} minority MPs per GRC has decreased with the advent of five-member and six-member GRCs. By having teams of candidates standing for election for GRCs helmed by senior politicians, the ruling People's Action Party has also used GRCs as a means for bringing first-time candidates into Parliament. Moreover, the GRC scheme is also said to disadvantage opposition parties <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> difficult for them to find enough candidates to contest GRCs. Furthermore, it is said that the GRC scheme means that electors have unequal voting power, weakens the relationship between electors and MPs, and entrenches racialism in Singapore politics.|$|E
5|$|The theater {{has been}} {{credited}} {{as contributing to}} the performing arts renaissance in Chicago, and has been favorably reviewed for its acoustics, sightlines, proscenium and for providing a home base for numerous performing organizations. Although {{it is seen as}} a high caliber venue for its music audiences, the theater is regarded as less than ideal for jazz groups <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive and larger than most places where jazz is performed. The design has been criticized for traffic flow problems, with an elevator bottleneck. However, the theater's prominent location and its underground design to preserve Millennium Park have been praised. Although there were complaints about high priced events in its early years, discounted ticket programs were introduced in the 2009–10 season.|$|E
5|$|Under {{appellation}} rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) {{of grapes}} can be pressed to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuvée {{and the next}} 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine {{is a blend of}} vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a minimum of three years of aging. There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier Champagne houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses keep their wines on the lees through the whole time of aging <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expense to bottle the wine then age it and finally shipped.|$|E
6000|$|It involves, therefore, always, {{ideas of}} power and dexterity, but also of restraint; and the delight you take in it should involve the {{understanding}} of the difficulty the workman dealt with. You perhaps doubt the extent to which this feeling justly extends, (in the first volume of [...] "Modern Painters," [...] expressed under the head [...] "Ideas of Power.") But why is a large stone in any building grander than a small one? Simply <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> difficult to raise it. So, also, an engraved line is, and ought to <b>be,</b> recognized as <b>more</b> grand than a pen or pencil line, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> difficult to execute it.|$|R
60|$|This {{seemed no}} more than reasonable, and hope once more filled my heart as I led the way along the bank, now moving with greater caution <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> {{probable}} we might come upon the enemy.|$|R
50|$|The {{hamlet of}} Boston Corner was {{formerly}} {{part of the}} town of Mount Washington, Massachusetts. <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> accessible from Ancram, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> annexed by the New York town on April 13, 1857, by an agreement between the states.|$|R
25|$|Geometry is {{important}} <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> difficult to push water through a long, narrow pipe than a wide, short pipe. In the same way, a long, thin copper wire has higher resistance (lower conductance) than a short, thick copper wire.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a debate}} over whether rousant or {{displayed}} is the eagle's default depiction. Displayed is more common <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> artistically pleasing and it fully uses the field's space. Displayed also predates the use of rousant, with examples {{going back to the}} early Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|Hundreds {{of arrows}} of various sorts {{are used to}} {{indicate}} movement of the hands through space. Movement notation gets quite complex, and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> exact than {{it needs to be}} for any one sign language, different people may choose to write the same sign in different ways.|$|E
50|$|The promptuary {{was never}} widely used, perhaps <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> complex to manufacture, {{and it took}} nearly as much time {{to lay out the}} strips to find the product of numbers as to find the answer with pen and paper.|$|R
5000|$|Down Beat complimented its [...] "simpler, drier, more austere sound" [...] {{and stated}} [...] "the unrehearsed, rough Miles Smiles holds up so well simply <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> of a jazz record ...

25|$|Poorly-designed {{walkways}} increase {{risks for}} the vision-impaired, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> difficult than at a signalised intersection to audibly detect {{whether there is}} a sufficient gap in traffic to cross safely. At a signalised intersection, traffic comes to a stop, and an audible sound can be generated to indicate {{that it is time to}} cross.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of broadheads used by hunters: The fixed-blade and the {{mechanical}} types. While the fixed-blade broadhead keeps its blades rigid and unmovable on the broadhead at all times, the mechanical broadhead deploys its blades upon contact with the target, its blades swinging out to wound the target. The mechanical head flies better <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> streamlined, but has less penetration as it uses some of the kinetic energy in the arrow to deploy its blades.|$|E
25|$|The {{improvement}} in shale gas extraction has increased natural gas supplies and reserves dramatically. Because of this fact, {{it is becoming}} the fuel of choice for an increasing amount of private investors and consumers <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> versatile than coal or oil {{and can be used}} in 90% of energy applications. Chile which once depended on hydro-power for 70% of its electricity supply, is now boosting its gas supplies to reduce reliance on its drought afflicted hydro dams. Similarly China is tapping its gas reserves to reduce reliance on coal, which is currently burned to generate 80% of the country’s electricity supply.|$|E
50|$|The book Al Muwatta by Imam Malik {{was written}} in the early Abbasid period in Madina. It does not contain any anti-Umayyad content <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> {{concerned}} with what the Quran and what Muhammad said and was not a history book on the Umayyads.|$|R

25|$|Distinguishing turbidites, contourites, and bottom-current {{modified}} turbidite deposits {{is essential}} for reconstructing the paleoenvironment in deepwater settings. Traction structures, such as cross-stratification, indicate bottom-current reworking <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> likely to have avalanching in clear bottom-currents {{than it is in}} sediment saturated turbidity flows. Deposition from suspension in turbidity flows do not generate a sharp upper contact as bottom-current reworked deposits show due to the highly oscillating energy conditions. Stanley (1993) proposes that the transition from a turbidite to a contourite involves a continuous transition from a sandy deposit to lenticular bedding passing through wavy bedding.|$|E
25|$|For the consumer, channel {{switching}} offers {{a more diverse}} shopping experience. However, marketers need to be alert to {{channel switching}} because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel switching can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found cheaper, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping). As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.|$|E
25|$|When {{conditions}} are favorable for swarming, the queen will start laying eggs in queen cups. A virgin queen will develop from a fertilized egg. The young queen larva develops differently <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> heavily fed royal jelly, a protein-rich secretion from glands on {{the heads of}} young workers. If not for being heavily fed royal jelly, the queen larva would have developed into a regular worker bee. All bee larvae are fed some royal jelly {{for the first few}} days after hatching but only queen larvae are fed on it exclusively. As a result of the difference in diet, the queen will develop into a sexually mature female, unlike the worker bees.|$|E
50|$|Did {{you know}} some men would shave off their real hair <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> fashionable to have a wig. Men's wigs were a lot simpler then woman's. Mens hairstyles often had a curl {{on both sides of}} the wig. Sometimes men might powder their hair too.|$|R
