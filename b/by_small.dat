5|$|An 1824 {{gazetteer}} {{noted that}} domestic production of cloth <b>by</b> <b>small</b> farmers had greatly declined {{due to the}} introduction of spinning mills. The Thursdays webb market was no longer operational and the drapers bought the cloth through their agents in the country.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Transandinomys talamancae has a complex penis, with the distal (far) end of the baculum (penis bone) ending in a structure consisting of three digits. As in most oryzomyines, the central digit {{is larger than the}} two at the sides. The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered <b>by</b> <b>small</b> spines, but there is a broad band of nonspinous tissue.|$|E

5|$|Based on his {{research}} for the book and mini-series The Pacific, author Hugh Ambrose suggested that Basilone was not killed by a mortar, but <b>by</b> <b>small</b> arms fire that {{hit him in the}} right groin and the neck, and nearly took off his left arm.|$|E
5|$|Birdwood {{planned to}} arrive off the {{peninsula}} after the moon had set, {{with the first}} troops landing at 03:30, an hour before dawn. He declined the offer of an old merchant ship, loaded with troops, being deliberately grounded at Gaba Tepe. Instead, the troops were to travel in naval and merchant ships, transferring to rowing boats towed <b>by</b> <b>small</b> steamboats to make the assault.|$|E

On one of these, his minesweeper was struck <b>by</b> <b>small</b> calibre shells 84 times and the other operations were scarcely less dangerous but, in spite of the Turkish resistance, Robinson was able to clear wide lanes for the invasion forces.|$|E

5|$|In eukaryotes, {{modifications}} of RNA nucleotides are in general directed <b>by</b> <b>small</b> nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA; 60–300nt), {{found in the}} nucleolus and cajal bodies. snoRNAs associate with enzymes and guide them to a spot on an RNA by basepairing to that RNA. These enzymes then perform the nucleotide modification. rRNAs and tRNAs are extensively modified, but snRNAs and mRNAs can also be the target of base modification. RNA can also be methylated.|$|E
5|$|LGBT {{themes were}} found first in {{underground}} or alternative comics, often published <b>by</b> <b>small</b> independent presses or self-published.

5|$|Some authors {{challenge}} {{the validity of}} the second step (mild opioids) and, pointing to their higher toxicity and low efficacy, argue that mild opioids could be replaced <b>by</b> <b>small</b> doses of strong opioids (with the possible exception of tramadol due to its demonstrated efficacy in cancer pain, its specificity for neuropathic pain, and its low sedative properties and reduced potential for respiratory depression in comparison to conventional opioids).|$|E

5|$|A {{permanent}} asymmetric moon {{dust cloud}} exists around the Moon, created <b>by</b> <b>small</b> particles from comets. Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moon's surface each 24 hours. The particles strike the Moon's surface ejecting moon dust above the Moon. The dust stays above the Moon approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present above the Moon, rising to 100 kilometers above the surface. The dust measurements {{were made by}} LADEE's Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), between 20 and 100 kilometers above the surface, during a six-month period. LDEX detected an average of one 0.3 micrometer moon dust particle each minute. Dust particle counts peaked during the Geminid, Quadrantid, Northern Taurid, and Omicron Centaurid meteor showers, when the Earth, and Moon, pass through comet debris. The cloud is asymmetric, more dense near {{the boundary between the}} Moon's dayside and nightside.|$|E
