40|$|Starch is {{the main}} form in which plants store {{carbohydrates}} reserves, {{both in terms of}} amounts and distribution among different plant species. Carbohydrates are direct products of photosynthetic activity, and it is well know that yield efficiency and production are directly correlated to the amount of carbohydrates synthesized and how these are distributed among vegetative and reproductive organs. Nowadays, in pear trees, due to the modernization of orchards, through the introduction of new rootstocks and the development of new training systems, the understanding and the development of new approaches regarding the distribution and storage of carbohydrates, are required. The objective of this research work was to study the behavior of carbohydrate reserves, mainly starch, in different pear tree organs and tissues: i. e., fruits, leaves, woody organs, roots and flower buds, at different physiological stages during the season. Starch in fruit is accumulated at early stages, and reached a maximum concentration during the middle phase of fruit development; after that, its degradation begins with a rise in soluble carbohydrates. Moreover, relationships between fruit starch degradation and different fruit traits, soluble sugars and organic acids were established. In woody organs and roots, an interconversion between starch and soluble carbohydrates was observed during the dormancy period that confirms its main function in supporting the growth and development of new tissues during the following spring. Factors as training systems, rootstocks, types of <b>bearing</b> <b>wood,</b> and their position on the canopy, influenced the concentrations of starch and soluble carbohydrates at different sampling dates. Also, environmental conditions and cultural practices must be considered to better explain these results. Thus, {{a deeper understanding of the}} dynamics of carbohydrates reserves within the plant could provide relevant information to improve several management practices to increase crop yield efficiency. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} of fire event after a strong earthquake is quite {{high and the}} damage caused by this fire could be significantly higher as compared to normal fire not accompanied by an earthquake. Thus {{it is important to know}} the behavior of structures under such circumstances. Modern buildings are designed to have adequate resistance against an expected level earthquake, and sufficient fire safety, considering these events to occur separately. However, fire following a seismic excitation is not uncommon. After an earthquake the structure may sustain a considerable damage and the fire resistance of the system will be significantly impaired. In this case, the fire performance of the structure will be significantly reduced, and such condition may pose a serious threat to structural integrity, which is detrimental to the life safety of the occupants and rescue workers. Thus, it is necessary to consider such scenarios in the design of a building constructed in a seismic zone. In this study the performance of two types of structures has been studied. Load <b>bearing</b> <b>wood</b> stud walls and moment resistant steel frames under such condition has been modeled and analyzed. The performance analysis of the wood stud wall in fire has been verified with the results from the NRC fire tests. For the steel frames, the results are validated with different finite element systems such as SAFIR and ANSYS. The analysis includes heat transfer analysis and thermal stress analysis by using numerical model for wood wall and finite element solver for steel frame. Existing numerical model for stability analysis of wood frame walls cannot be applied to cases with fire and earthquake induced fire. Modifications are proposed to the existing methods in order to account for the time dependent changes in strength, stiffness and geometry due to earthquake and fire in order to determine the fire resistance of the structures. Two analytical approaches have been proposed for modeling the damage in the steel structure after earthquake. Fire resistance rates are investigated for both normal and post earthquake fire scenarios. It is observed from the study that the fire followed by an earthquake reduces the fire resistance of a structure in both wood-frame and steel-frame structures. The study presented here forms a preliminary understanding of the PEF phenomenon and its effect on structures. Further studies are needed to enhance the understanding, quantify the parametric changes and formulate design guidelines to account for PEF hazard to structures in seismic zones.

This study shows that the steel plate length, in some cases, has little or no impact on primarily the splitting load. Furthermore, the buckling load decreases as the depth of the beam increases, the influence of the depth being proportional to 1 /h 2.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Nailed {{joints between}} {{sheathing}} and framing in light-frame wood buildings {{play a vital}} role in assuring structural safety by providing the stiffness needed to transfer the forces among the building components and the medium of energy dissipation during severe earthquakes and wind storms. However, the exact nature of load transfer and energy dissipation in nailed joints has not been characterized. This investigation was aimed at theoretically and experimentally characterizing the dynamic behavior of typical nailed joints. The theoretical evaluation combined the linear step-by-step analysis and the concept of beam-on-elastic-foundation to model the nonlinear behavior of joints with interlayer gaps. The effect of damping was included by postulating a model with springs and dashpots and then using, experimental data to demonstrate its accuracy. Pseudo-dynamic tests were conducted on four twenty-specimen samples that were matched with respect to their material properties. The samples were tested to determine the nail <b>bearing</b> for <b>wood</b> and plywood, and the behavior of complete joints and joints with gaps. The nail bearing properties were used to formulate a mechanism for stiffness and slip due to wood and plywood crushing which was then verified by comparing its predictions to the results from testing joints with gap. A sensitivity study based on the complete-joint model shows that the slip modulus has the greatest effect on the joint damping. Both, the dissipated and slip work were found to decrease with increasing slip modulus. The rate of decrease is significant at law loads for the submodel of interlayer friction, but not as substantial at high loads. The variation of the slip modulus in wood and plywood affects the rate of decrease the most at high loads. The experimental results show that the traditionally defined equivalent viscous damping significantly underestimates the damping of tight nailed joints, because the assumption of linearity overestimates the slip work. However, for specimens with gap under small loads, the assumption of linear damping results in an accurate damping ratio...|$|R
