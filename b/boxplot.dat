50|$|In {{statistical}} {{graphics and}} scientific visualization, the contour <b>boxplot</b> is an exploratory tool {{that has been}} proposed for visualizing ensembles of feature-sets determined by a threshold on some scalar function (e.g. level-sets, isocontours). Analogous to the classical <b>boxplot</b> and considered {{an expansion of the}} concepts defining functional <b>boxplot,</b> the descriptive statistics of a contour <b>boxplot</b> are: the envelope of the 50% central region, the median curve and the maximum non-outlying envelope.|$|E

50|$|To {{construct}} a functional <b>boxplot,</b> data ordering {{is the first}} step. In functional data analysis, each observation is a real function, therefore, different from the classical <b>boxplot</b> where data are simply ordered from the smallest sample value to the largest, in a functional <b>boxplot,</b> functional data, e.g. curves or images, are ordered by a notion of band depth or a modified band depth. It allows for ordering functional data from the center outwards and, thus, introduces a measure to define functional quantiles and the centrality or outlyingness of an observation. Having the ranks of functional data, the functional <b>boxplot</b> is {{a natural extension of}} the classical <b>boxplot.</b>|$|E
30|$|Functional <b>boxplots</b> {{have been}} {{introduced}} in Functional Statistics as an instrument to detect and identify the presence of possible outliers in a dataset where each datum is represented by a function. Functional <b>boxplots</b> {{are based on the}} definition of band depth (BD) measures, or modified band depth (MBD) measure introduced in [20], where each function in the sample is ordered and ranked from the center outward and, thus, it is possible to define functional quantiles and the centrality or outlyingness of an observation. The construction of functional <b>boxplots,</b> as well as the associated outlier detection rule are described in [19]. In the same paper, a simulation study comparing the performance of functional <b>boxplots</b> with other techniques present in literature for functional outliers detection is also reported, showing that functional <b>boxplots</b> provide a very reliable instrument to detect outliers in a functional dataset.|$|R
30|$|A second aspect that we {{analyzed}} was the variance. <b>Boxplots</b> in Fig.  5 show low variance with MERCALLI {{in several cases}} (see <b>boxplots</b> for TWEETS NORM, AVERAGE LENGTH, and AVERAGE WORDS). However, there are features which show high variance in relation to MERCALLI, such as HASHTAG SYMBOLS, RT SYMBOLS, and MENTION SYMBOLS.|$|R

50|$|By {{introducing}} {{the concept of}} central regions, the functional <b>boxplot</b> can be generalized to an enhanced functional <b>boxplot</b> where the 25% and 75% central regions are provided as well.|$|E
50|$|Outliers can be {{detected}} in a functional <b>boxplot</b> by the 1.5 times the 50% central region empirical rule, analogous to the 1.5 IQR empirical rule for classical boxplots. The fences are obtained by inflating the envelope of the 50% central region by 1.5 times theheight of the 50% central region. Any observations outside the fences are flagged as potential outliers. When each observation is simply a point, the functional <b>boxplot</b> degenerates to a classical <b>boxplot,</b> and it {{is different from the}} pointwise boxplots.|$|E
50|$|Spatio-{{temporal}} {{data can}} be viewed as a temporal curve at each spatial location, or a spatial surface at each time. In the latter case, a volume-based surface band depth can be used to order sample surfaces and leads to a three-dimensional surface <b>boxplot</b> with similar characteristics as the functional boxplots. Similarly, the fences are obtained by the 1.5 times the 50% central region rule. Any surface outside the fences are flagged as outlier candidates. The surface <b>boxplot</b> is a natural extension of the functional <b>boxplot</b> to R3.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the number of reflection coefficients to be considered as feature, detailed statistical analysis on first few reflection coefficients is performed. As an example, EEG recordings of all the sessions of a particular subject performing mathematical multiplication (M) and visual counting (C) tasks are considered. After performing the necessary preprocessing, the reflection coefficients are extracted. In this case, four reflection coefficients are computed considering AR (4) system. In Fig.  2 a, the <b>boxplots</b> of the first reflection coefficient indicating some statistical information, such as median, 25 th and 75 th percentile, and outliers are shown. There are twelve <b>boxplots</b> corresponding to six channel data with {{two different types of}} tasks, indicated with two different letters M and C after the channel label. To be more specific, C 3 -M and C 3 -C correspond to <b>boxplots</b> obtained from the EEG data of channel C 3; first one refers to mathematical multiplication and the second one to visual counting tasks.

50|$|To {{construct}} a contour <b>boxplot,</b> data ordering {{is the first}} step. In functional data analysis, each observation is a real function, therefore data ordering {{is different from the}} classical <b>boxplot</b> where scalar data are simply ordered from the smallest sample value to the largest. More generally, data depth, gives a center-outward ordering of data points, and thereby provides a mechanism for constructing rank statistics of various kinds of multidimensional data. For instance, functional data examples can be ordered using the method of band depth or a modified band depth. In contour data analysis, each observation is a feature-set (a subset of the domain), and therefore not a function. Thus, the notion of band depth and modified band depth is further extended to accommodate features that can be expressed as sets but not necessarily as functions. Contour band depth allows for ordering feature-set data from the center outwards and, thus, introduces a measure to define functional quantiles and the centrality or outlyingness of an observation. Having the ranks of feature-set data, the contour <b>boxplot</b> is a natural extension of the classical <b>boxplot</b> which in special cases reduces back to the traditional functional <b>boxplot.</b>|$|E

Statistical significance is assumed for p < 0.05. For non-parametric data, Kruskal-Wallis following Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni correction were used for significant differences.|$|R
