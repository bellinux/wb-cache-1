40|$|For {{assessing}} earthquake hazard {{of metro}} cities, knowledge of soil amplification, thickness and properties of sedimentary layer are essential. In order {{to map the}} soil thickness using microtremor survey method, in Bangalore city, it is required to calibrate the relation between fundamental resonance frequency of the soil layer and its thickness for the region. For this purpose microtremor survey was carried out at 34 locations {{in the city where}} <b>borehole</b> <b>log</b> was available. The resonance frequency of the soil is evaluated from the microtremor recordings using the H/V ratio technique. A nonlinear regression relation between the thickness of sedimentary layer h (m), from the <b>borehole</b> <b>logs,</b> and the resonance frequency fr (Hz), was derived as h=(58. 3 Â± 8. 8) fr -(0. 95) Â± 0. 1. Using the model of shear wave velocity increasing with depth at these locations, the derived average shear wave velocity and the corresponding soil thickness were used, to get an empirical relation between VS (m/s) and depth z(m), as Vs=(174 Â± 28) (1 +z) 0. 16 Â± 0. 07. This relation also compares reasonably with the fit obtained between simulated VS and depth from <b>borehole</b> <b>logs</b> for Bangalore city. The calibrated relations can be used at locations in Bangalore city where <b>borehole</b> <b>logs</b> are not available, for finding the thicknesses and shear wave velocities of the local soil layers at the survey locations.

50|$|Well logging, {{also known}} as <b>borehole</b> <b>logging</b> is the {{practice}} of making a detailed record (a well log) of the geologic formations penetrated by a borehole. The log may be based either on visual inspection of samples brought to the surface (geological logs) or on physical measurements made by instruments lowered into the hole (geophysical logs). Some types of geophysical well logs can be done during any phase of a well's history: drilling, completing, producing, or abandoning. Well logging is performed in boreholes drilled for the oil and gas, groundwater, mineral and geothermal exploration, as well as part of environmental and geotechnical studies.|$|E
5000|$|The goal of seismic {{interpretation}} is {{to obtain a}} coherent geological story from the map of processed seismic reflections. [...] At its most simple level, {{seismic interpretation}} involves tracing and correlating along continuous reflectors throughout the 2D or 3D dataset and using these {{as the basis for}} the geological interpretation. The aim of this is to produce structural maps that reflect the spatial variation in depth of certain geological layers. Using these maps hydrocarbon traps can be identified and models of the subsurface can be created that allow volume calculations to be made. However, a seismic dataset rarely gives a picture clear enough to do this. This is mainly because of the vertical and horizontal seismic resolution but often noise and processing difficulties also result in a lower quality picture. Due to this, there is always a degree of uncertainty in a seismic interpretation and a particular dataset could have more than one solution that fits the data. In such a case, more data will be needed to constrain the solution, for example in the form of further seismic acquisition, <b>borehole</b> <b>logging</b> or gravity and magnetic survey data. Similarly to the mentality of a seismic processor, a seismic interpreter is generally encouraged to be optimistic in order encourage further work rather than the abandonment of the survey area. [...] Seismic interpretation is completed by both geologists and geophysicists, with most seismic interpreters having an understanding of both fields.|$|E

30|$|The petrophysical {{properties}} (porosity, matrix thermal conductivity, {{and heat}} production rate) of the reservoir units Burano and Farma {{have been obtained}} from <b>borehole</b> <b>log</b> analyses and laboratory measurements on cores and cuttings. These data (<b>borehole</b> <b>logs,</b> cores, and cuttings) were available from three boreholes in the study area. A total of 78 cutting samples were taken from two boreholes (sampling distance 50 – 100 [*]m) and investigated in the laboratory for grain density and thermal conductivity of the rock matrix. Thermal conductivity measurements on cuttings were performed by a line source equipment following the procedures of Erbas (2001). In addition, ten core samples were investigated for thermal conductivity by an optical core scanner (Popov et al. 1999). The core samples also underwent standard investigation for porosity and bulk and grain density.|$|R
30|$|The hydrogeological {{study of}} Apapa, a coastal part of Lagos, Nigeria, has been {{investigated}} using combined geophysical <b>borehole</b> <b>logs,</b> consisting of natural gamma and electrical resistivity components and ditch cutting samples. This study utilized data from 10 boreholes to delineate freshwater aquifer and proposes the best borehole design and construction for optimum groundwater developments in the study area. The electrical resistivity log data show that the depth to the freshwater interface varies across the study area occurring between 150 and 160  m and as shallow as 110  m in a borehole. The variations in depth of the freshwater interfaces are attributed {{to the extent of}} saline/brackish water contamination and distribution of rock types. Based on these differences and the inability to identify water quality from ditch cuttings, <b>borehole</b> geophysical <b>logging</b> is a vital tool in providing in situ subsurface information of the rock types and fluid contents in groundwater studies. This further demonstrates that geophysical <b>borehole</b> <b>logs</b> play an important part in borehole design for development of water wells.|$|R

30|$|These {{log data}} are {{expensive}} to obtain {{and are not}} readily available to geophysicists.

40|$|Joint {{inversion}} of seismic AVA and CSEM data requires rock-physics relationships to link seismic attributes to electrical properties. Ideally, we can connect them through reservoir parameters (e. g., porosity and water saturation) by developing physical-based models, such as Gassmann’s equations and Archie’s law, using nearby <b>borehole</b> <b>logs.</b> This could be {{difficult in the}} exploration stage because information available is typically insufficient for choosing suitable rock-physics models and for subsequently obtaining reliable estimates of the associated parameters. The use of improper rock-physics models and the inaccuracy of the estimates of model parameters may cause misleading inversion results. Conversely, {{it is easy to}} derive statistical relationships among seismic and electrical attributes and reservoir parameters from distant <b>borehole</b> <b>logs.</b> In this study, we develop a Bayesian model to jointly invert seismic AVA and CSEM data for reservoir parameter estimation using statistical rock-physics models; the spatial dependence of geophysical and reservoir parameters are carried out by lithotypes through Markov random fields. We apply the developed model to a synthetic case, which simulates a CO{sub 2 } monitoring application. We derive statistical rock-physics relations from <b>borehole</b> <b>logs</b> at one location and estimate seismic P- and S-wave velocity ratio, acoustic impedance, density, electrical resistivity, lithotypes, porosity, and water saturation at three different locations by conditioning to seismic AVA and CSEM data. Comparison of the inversion results with their corresponding true values shows that the correlation-based statistical rock-physics models provide significant information for improving the joint inversion results...|$|R

40|$|A {{case history}} is {{reported}} to outline a possible strategy {{for the construction of}} a pseudo- 2 D model of shear-wave velocity for seismic site response studies. Experimental data have been collected using the Multichannel Analysis of Surface Wave technique (MASW) at six sites in the city of Najaf (Southern Iraq). The sites are aligned along the route of a proposed subway.

The initial model for the local search algorithm has been obtained with a preliminary Monte Carlo Inversion (MCI). A priori information from <b>borehole</b> <b>logs</b> and lateral constraints between neighbors 1 D models are used to mitigate the non-uniqueness of the solution.
