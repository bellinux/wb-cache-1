50|$|In 1909, Nathan Shigon of New York City {{invented a}} monocular optometer {{with a range}} of +0.25 to +6.00 diopters, {{consisting}} of a mechanism where a disc of low-powered lenses advanced a second disc of higher power lenses automatically with each rotation, as in a modern phoropter. There is no evidence this was ever manufactured, but in 1915 he filed for a patent for a binocular version of this same optometer, and called it the Ski-Optometer, so named for its usefulness in doing skiascopy. This was manufactured by Wm. F. Reimold of Philadelphia. It included a Stevens Phorometer for measuring phorias, and a disc of auxiliary spherical lenses on the back, giving it a range of -12.00 to +12.00. To extend the range, there were clips on the front of each eye hole for the insertion of hand held sphere or cylinder trial lenses, with a mechanism to rotate the axis with the thumb. It weighed 2 lb. 3 oz. Around 1916 Michael Woolf, also of New York City, bought him out and added his own invention, an innovative <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinder</b> lenses, ranging from -0.25 to -2.00, to the device, as well as Risley prisms for each eye. Maddox rods were optional. It weighed 3 lb. 13 oz. Around 1924 the patents and rights were transferred to General Optical Company of Mount Vernon, NY, which had been making a much larger, heavier and more solidly encased instrument, called the Genothalmic Refractor, since around 1920, using Woolf's 1917 patent number, and with a user's manual dated 1921. This instrument had a range of +17.75 to - 22.50, and up to -3.75 cylinder, Maddox rods, Risley prisms, and a Steven's phorometer. It weighed 7 pounds 5 ounces, and unlike all earlier devices of this kind, it hung from a horizontal mounting bar instead of being supported from the bottom. Like the Woolf, it had no Jackson cross-cylinders at first, so a separate hand-held one was required. Late models of the Genothalmic were fitted with JCC's. General Optical sold out to Shuron Optical of Geneva, NY in 1927, which sold the refractor until the late 1930s. A refined and improved version of the Genothalmic Refrator was manufactured in London starting around 1932, and sold in the UK by S. R. Stearman, S. Pulzer & Son Ltd., and others, as the British Refracting Unit (B.R.U.).|$|E
5000|$|The {{station was}} {{automated}} on 7 January 1959 and the dioptric lens with its revolving machine and vaporised paraffin incandescent burner {{were replaced by}} a new fourth order cylindric refractor lens. Its mantle light source used dissolved acetylene from a <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> giving a candlepower of 2,600 white light and 500 in the red sector. This appeared to be worse than the old light and mariners using the harbour complained about the new lens.|$|R

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} with a side-by-side arrangement of two vertical, high aspect ratio (length over diameter) and low mass ratio (mass over mass <b>of</b> displaced fluid) <b>cylinders,</b> pin-jointed {{at the ends}} and vibrating at low mode number, were carried out in a free-surface water channel. The dynamic response of the models under two different wake interference situations is presented here. Initially, one <b>of</b> the <b>cylinders</b> was fixed {{and the other was}} completely free to move. In a second <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> experiments both <b>cylinders</b> were free to vibrate. A very large parameter space was covered by varying the free-stream flow speeds, the natural frequencies of the system and the separation between the models, allowing the identification of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) and wake-coupled VIV (WCVIV). Amplitudes, frequencies and phase synchronisation between the models are presented...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, ophthalmologists A. S. Green, L. D. Green, and M. I. Green, of San Francisco, CA, {{designed}} an optometer, which they developed slowly over many years. Drs. Green {{teamed up with}} inventor Clyde L. Hunsicker of San Francisco, who applied for a patent on October 25, 1926. The title of their invention was simply an [...] "optometrist instrument", and the text described it as an optometer. Patent 1,804,690 was granted to the Greens and Hunsicker in 1931, and sold to Bausch & Lomb, who had them redesign it (patent 1,873,356, granted 1932). B&L trademarked it as [...] "Greens' Refractor" [...] and introduced it in 1934. It was far more advanced than the competition in many ways. The power could be read right off the dial without having to do mental calculations, the range was far higher, from +19.75 to -28.00 and with cylinders up to -7.50, the <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> was much more intuitive and easy to use, {{and it was the}} first to have Jackson cross cylinders affixed, (the first AO Phoroptors with JCC's were late models of the Additive, and very late Genothalmic Refractors also had them). It weighed 13 lbs. 1 oz. The Greens' Refractor soon became the gold standard among eyecare professionals. It helped put the Woolf/Genothalmic/Shuron line out of the market and forced AO to completely redesign their phoroptor from scratch, not once, but twice, (the 590 failed to compete). The Greens' Refractor remained unchanged for over 4 decades, but sales slipped when AO introduced the Ultramatic RxMaster with its revolutionary yoked JCC in 1967, and production of the Greens' Refractor finally ended in the late 1970s. In 1978, B&L introduced the Greens' II refractor with yoked JCC, but due to patent dispute lost it to AO, who discontinued it. As for the original Greens' Refractor, in spite of the fact that production stopped decades ago, many are still being used today, as they are virtually indestructible, and have a devoted rank of optometrists who swear by them.|$|R
50|$|Around 1910, binocularity {{was tested}} using trial frames which sat on the patient's face or on a support bar, with extra testing devices added {{to the front of}} the frames, such as Maddox rods, {{rotating}} prisms, and phorometers. The refraction part of the exam was done with trial lenses that fit into the back of the same trial frame. Optometer was the generic name for devices, crude and simple, with rotating <b>batteries</b> <b>of</b> sphere and <b>cylinder</b> lenses placed in front of each eye, one at a time, so there was no testing for binocularity. When the optometer and phorometer were combined into single instruments, the modern refractor/phoropter was born, which happened in the middle 1910s when two companies in the New York City area began to market competing versions.|$|R
50|$|Also in 1909, Henry DeZeng got {{a patent}} for what looks remarkably like a modern phoropter, but the patent {{illustrations}} look {{nothing like the}} manufactured product, which was introduced around 1915--the DeZeng Phoro-Optometer model 570. This was a device produced in Camden, New Jersey, which contained a <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> convex lenses for each eye, a <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> concave lenses for each eye, and auxiliary lenses which gave it a total power range of +15.75 to -19.75, {{as well as a}} Maddox rod and Risley prism for each eye, and a Steven's phorometer. There were no cylindrical lenses, so testing for astigmatism required the use of manual trial-lenses, for which there were rotating holders on the front of each eye hole, and there were stationary ones on the backs as well. Cross-cylinders were optional, but they did not flip like a Jackson cross cylinder, they rotated in the same plane, so they were probably meant for the near point cross-cylinder test for reading. It weighed 3 lb. 2 oz. Around 1920 an improved model, No. 574, was introduced, reduced in size but with the same range (lenses reduced from 1 inch to ¾ inch). The forehead rest was removed, and the rear trial lens clips were replaced with rubber eye guards. It weighed 2 lbs. 12 oz. In 1922, DeZeng replaced No. 574 with No. 584, and shortened the name to Phoroptor. This device became so popular that its name became genericized, though often spelled phoropter. The Phoroptor was smaller (lenses reduced again, to 9/16 inch diameter) and more precisely made than the 574, but with a similar power range, and the front clips for hand-held trial lenses were removed and replaced with <b>batteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinder</b> lenses ranging from -0.25 to -4.75. The Steven's phorometer was dropped, and there were no Jackson cross cylinders. It weighed 2 lb. 8 oz. In 1925, American Optical Co. bought DeZeng, and in 1927 introduced No. 588, the AO Wellsworth DeZeng Phoroptor, which was slightly larger; the lenses were increased to 11/16 inch and it weighed 3 lb. 2 oz. This was the first in the DeZeng/AO line to hang from a horizontal mounting bar, the earlier ones were supported from a bar below it. This phoroptor was unique in that it was calibrated in 1/8 diopter steps throughout its whole range. In 1934, AO introduced No. 589, the Additive Effective Power Phoroptor, once again enlarged and improved. The lenses were increased to ¾ inch diameter, the permanent size, and the unit was much more massive, with a weight of 7 lb. 9 oz., and with a range of +16.87 to -19.12 and -6.00 cylinder, with auxiliary lenses to increase these to +18.87/-21.12/-8.00. All these models resembled the original DeZeng model in design, but No. 590 of 1948 was a completely re-designed device, much larger and heavier, and more modern. It weighed 10 lbs. 7 oz. This was followed by another complete re-design in 1956, the RxMaster, which became the prototype of all modern phoropters, and was updated to the Ultramatic RxMaster in 1967, which is the current model. AO sold their phoroptor division to Reichert in 1982, who still makes the Ultramatic.|$|R

40|$|Standard {{analytic}} {{linear model}} <b>of</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> usually comes from assumptions of identical action piston areas {{on both sides}} <b>of</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> (double piston rod) and suitable operation point, which is usually chosen {{in the middle of}} piston.
