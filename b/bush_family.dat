5|$|Several times a year, Bush and {{her husband}} travel to their {{sprawling}} family estate, the Bush compound, better known as Walker's Point. Located in Kennebunkport, Maine, the compound is where <b>Bush</b> <b>family</b> gatherings have been held for nearly 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{attended}} St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls' school (later part of St Mary's and St Joseph's School, Sidcup), in Woolwich Road, Abbey Wood, south east London, in the mid-1970s. During {{this time}} her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which {{was turned down}} by record labels. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the <b>Bush</b> <b>family.</b> Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded {{that would be more}} saleable to the record companies. Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour. The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick. The tape was sent to EMI executive Terry Slater. Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her. The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts.|$|E
25|$|During the {{administration}} of George W. Bush the new curator, William Allman along with new Bush appointees to the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, including <b>Bush</b> <b>family</b> decorator Ken Blasingame, continued with the process. A boldly patterned Renaissance Revival patterned carpet was created for the room. The wallpaper became a compromise, using the diamond pattern found in the historic engravings and painting, but eschewing the deep Victorian color palette found in the oil painting, for a much lighter off-white color favored by the <b>Bush</b> <b>family</b> {{in many of the}} White House rooms they refurbished.|$|E

25|$|Bush Terminal {{is named}} after its founder Irving T. <b>Bush.</b> His <b>family</b> name came from Jan Bosch, {{who was born in}} the Netherlands and immigrated to New Amsterdam (now New York) in 1662.

25|$|While in Texas, in 1959, George Bush {{was elected}} Harris County Republican Party chairman, {{in the first}} of what would become many elections. His first run for a {{prominent}} political office was in 1964, for U.S. Senator from Texas and although he lost, the exposure of the <b>Bush</b> <b>family</b> put George and Barbara Bush on the national scene.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Harris {{ran against}} Sarasota Attorney Jan Schneider for the congressional {{district}} vacated by retiring Republican Rep.

25|$|Ross Perot {{achieved}} {{a great deal}} of success in Maine in the presidential elections of 1992 and 1996. In 1992, as an independent candidate, Perot came in second to Democrat Bill Clinton, despite the longtime presence of the <b>Bush</b> <b>family</b> summer home in Kennebunkport. In 1996, as the nominee of the Reform Party, Perot did better in Maine than in any other state.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, Vice President Bush {{announced}} his candidacy for President to succeed Reagan. By this time Barbara had experienced two presidential campaigns, but broke new ground by becoming the second candidate's spouse {{to speak at}} the national party convention that nominated her husband (after Eleanor Roosevelt in 1940). She promised voters that she would be a traditional first lady and campaigned actively for her husband. The campaign at times focused on the large <b>Bush</b> <b>family,</b> and contrasted her with the First Lady, Nancy Reagan, by highlighting her interest in domestic staples such as church, gardening, and time spent with family while placing less emphasis on style sense and fashion; she drew attention to both her famous white hair and disinterest in wearing designer clothes. She generally avoided discussion of political issues during the campaign, particularly those on which she and her husband differed, and those closely involved with the campaign have reported that she was actively involved in campaign strategy. Bush was elected in November 1988 and sworn in on January 20, 1989– and the nation had a new first lady.|$|E
500|$|Construction of {{the oldest}} {{portions}} of the house known as Arrowhead {{took place in the}} 1780s. Built by Captain David Bush, the wood frame and clapboard house was apparently used as an inn. The <b>Bush</b> <b>family</b> sold the property to Pittsfield doctor John Brewster in 1844, who in 1850 sold the [...] property to the writer Herman Melville. The house at that time consisted of a simple rectangular structure with five window bays across and two deep, with a large central chimney. There is some evidence that the house may originally have had three stories, but {{at the time of the}} Melville purchase in 1850, it only had two and a half.|$|E
500|$|In March she affirmed {{her support}} for her brother-in-law, calling {{herself and her}} husband [...] "huge Jeb supporters". It was {{reported}} {{that she would be}} assisting the campaign's fundraising in Florida in October, Bloomberg News commenting that Jeb Bush was [...] "calling in help from perhaps the most popular member of his family". According to Clay Johnson, a friend of the <b>Bush</b> <b>family,</b> she was reportedly surprised by Donald Trump's becoming frontrunner {{over the course of the}} election cycle. In February 2016, amid her brother-in-law's campaign trailing Trump in South Carolina polls, Bush traveled there with her husband. Jeb Bush dropped out of the race after the South Carolina primary. The following month, Bush declined answering if she would vote for Trump, who was the frontrunner in the Republican primary, should he become the nominee and said the U.S. was going through a xenophobic period at the time of the election cycle. Ultimately, Bush and her husband refused to vote for president in 2016.|$|E

500|$|While Bush {{endorsed}} the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, {{he declined to}} endorse the 2016 Republican nominee Donald Trump {{and he did not}} attend the 2016 Republican National Convention, which formally nominated Trump. On the eve of Trump's nomination, it was reported that Bush had privately expressed concern about the current direction of the Republican Party and told a group of his former aides and advisors, [...] "I'm worried that I will be the last Republican president." [...] Bush and his wife Laura did not vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election according to a spokesperson for the <b>Bush</b> <b>family,</b> instead choosing to leave their presidential ballots blank. After the election, Bush, his father, and his brother Jeb called Trump on the phone to congratulate him on his victory. Both he and Laura attended Trump's inauguration, and images of Bush struggling to put on a rain poncho during the ceremony became an internet meme.|$|E
500|$|First, Homer sends bottle rockets at George's window, and George puts up {{a banner}} reading [...] "Two Bad Neighbors", in {{reference}} to Bart and Homer. Homer then glues a rainbow-colored wig on his opponent's head just before {{he is about to}} give an important speech to a local club. George retaliates by destroying the Simpsons' lawn with his car. Homer and Bart are making their way through the sewers to release locusts in George's house when George spots them and climbs down. Homer and George begin fighting, so Bart releases the locusts which attack George. At the same time, former Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev arrives at the mansion to bring a house warming present for the <b>Bush</b> <b>family.</b> Finally, after pressure from his wife, George apologizes to Homer in front of Gorbachev, much to George's dislike. The Bushes eventually move out and sell the house to Gerald Ford, another former President. Ford invites Homer to watch a football game with him, and to enjoy some beer and nachos at his house. The two quickly get off to a good start, sharing common ground.|$|E
500|$|In July, some of Perot's past actions, {{including}} a private {{investigation of the}} <b>Bush</b> <b>family</b> in the late 1980s, circulated in the media, causing frustration for the campaign. Perot blamed the reports on a [...] "Republican research team" [...] and claimed that he was warned that since {{he had such a}} [...] "clean record they have got to try to redefine you and destroy you". Campaign officials tried {{to come up with a}} new strategy to combat the negative press, and to end Perot's use of generalizations on the issues. Perot sought National Institutes of Health head Dr. Bernadine Healy as his running mate, but she declined. Meanwhile, Perot faced obstacles on the campaign trail. During an Olympia rally, he was approached by a gay rights group, demanding that he address AIDS and gay rights; he soon flipped on the issue and stated that he would allow gays to serve in the military and in his cabinet. During an address to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Perot faced his toughest demographic, and made the gaffe of referring to African Americans as [...] "you people". It was later revealed that Perot did not want to appear at the meeting or any other forum without his supporters. Press consultant Squires had written a speech for Perot for the occasion, but he instead used his own. After the speech, Perot was concerned that members of the New Black Panther Party were plotting his assassination.|$|E
