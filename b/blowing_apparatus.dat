In 1934 its locomotives averaged [...] between failures, {{whereas the}} figure for locomotives in Great Britain {{for the same}} year was [...] Staff error caused 17% of failures but far more were caused by poor water, which PR's General Manager reported was [...] "the most pressing of all the railway problems".

The HQ details of 1st S/L Rgt and 172nd LAA Bty (58th (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) LAA Rgt), {{supported}} by Bren gunners from Lt Airey Neave's Troop of 2nd S/L Bty at nearby Coulogne, held the position {{for five hours}} before Goldney ordered them to slip back towards Calais. He ordered Neave to withdraw his men by lorry to Calais, pausing only to destroy his experimental sound locator, codenamed 'Cuckoo'. Neave with a sergeant and a sapper, failed to <b>blow</b> the <b>apparatus</b> up with Gun cotton, but two French drivers abandoned and set on fire their tankers of aviation fuel and the resultant blaze destroyed the equipment successfully.|$|R
50|$|We {{think the}} case must be {{considered}} as if, the principle being well known, the plaintiff had first invented a mode of applying it by a mechanical apparatus to furnaces; and his invention then consists in this — by interposing a receptacle for heated air between the <b>blowing</b> <b>apparatus</b> and the furnace. In this receptacle he directs the air to be heated by the application of heat externally to the receptacle, and thus he accomplishes the object of applying the blast, which was before of cold air, in a heated state to the furnace.|$|E

50|$|Most of the {{instrument}} is the one originally constructed for this church by Hele & Co of Plymouth in 1894 {{at a cost of}} £750. At that time, the Choir and some slides on the Great and Swell were only “prepared for”. In 1926 it was given a clean and overhaul by Henry Speechly & Sons of London, who also added the Choir stops and soundboard, the reed stops at 16' and 4' on the Swell, 8’ on the Great, and 16’ on the Pedal. They also installed the electric blower to replace the hand <b>blowing</b> <b>apparatus</b> previously used. In 1950, Roger Yates of Michaelstow cleaned all the pipe work, and added the Swell Tremolo, the Pedal 4' Nachthorn, and the pneumatic relay to enable the Pedal Quint to be derived from the Bourdon/Bass Flute rank.|$|E

5000|$|In {{reaching}} {{the conclusion that}} Morse's claim 8 was too broad and thus not subject to patent protection, the Court considered not only the fact that Morse did not teach and enable other ways to communicate information at a great distance by using the electromagnetic force, but also whether the claim was at such {{a high level of}} generality and abstraction that it claimed an [...] "idea" [...] rather than a practical application and implementation of an idea. In analyzing this aspect of the case, the Court looked to a recent English decision, Neilson v. Harford. Neilson upheld a patent on using heated air to oxidize carbon in cast iron in a Bessemer Converter against the claim that it was just a patent on the idea or principle that heating the injected air makes a blast furnace work better. The court pointed to the apparatus that Neilson used to preheat the air, which made the patent one on an implementation of the principle, not one on the principle itself. Morse, of course, disclosed apparatus only for the repeater system and no other. The language of the English court, picked up by the Supreme Court, was important in 20th century computer software cases:We think the case must be considered as if, the principle being well known, the plaintiff had first invented a mode of applying it by a mechanical apparatus to furnaces; and his invention then consists in this - the interposing a receptacle for heated air between the <b>blowing</b> <b>apparatus</b> and the furnace. In this receptacle he directs the air to be heated, by the application of heat externally to the receptacle, and thus he accomplishes the object of applying the blast, which before was of cold air, in a heated state to the furnace.|$|E

40|$|Soap bubbles are {{a common}} {{interfacial}} fluid dynamics phenomenon having appli-cations such as buoyant hollow spherical fillers and flow visualization of large scale airflows. In contrast to the dynamics of liquid drops in gas and gas bubbles in liquid, the dynamics of soap bubbles has not been well documented, possibly because soap bubbles have gas-liquid-gas interfaces. Having the thin-liquid-film interface seems to alter {{the characteristics of the}} bubble/drop creation process. Thus, the main objec-tive {{of this study is to}} experimentally examine how airflow develops and interacts with the soap liquid film as the film stretches and finally collapses to pinch-off. A soap bubble <b>blowing</b> <b>apparatus</b> was constructed to consistently reproduce soap bubble blowing process with various soap ring sizes, and high-speed videography was utilized to investigate the blowing process. The minimum radius of the neck of the soap liquid tube was measured when approaching pinch-off. It is seen that the minimum neck radius is approximately proportional to the time left till pinch-off by a scaling exponent of about 2 / 3. The exponent is 1 / 3 for a gas bubble in liquid and 2 / 3 for a liquid drop in gas. This indicates that liquid drops collapse more slowly tha...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Foaming {{experiments}} {{in order to}} understand the evolution of the foam structure blown in different directions and levels of gravity have been carried out. The key elements of the experiment are the foam generator body (henceforth FG) and the controlled <b>blowing</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The FG was a polymer foam infiltrated with a suspension (distilled water, pure tenside (SDS, 0. 05 m%) and SiO 2 nanoparticles (2 m%)) Foams were blown out at 1. 5, 2, 4, 6, 10 and at 15 g levels in three different directions (0, 90 and 180 o, measured to the direction of the gravity vector). The elevated gravity condition was implemented in a hyper-g centrifuge (ZARM Bremen). Results show that foams can be created even at high gravity levels though the foamability and foam structure alters a lot by varying gravity level and foaming direction. At higher g-levels, under fixed gas flow rate and blowing time less foam could be produced. The average cell size varied with the blowing directions but proved constant on any gravity levels. On base of the gravity direction dependent pressure curves the foaming process was interpreted in detail. It was found that the sedimentation ruled capillary clogging is the main process by causing the gravity direction dependent foaming phenomena. The unexpected observation is that the foam stability does not depend on the gravity level...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. In this work asphalt air blowing has been studied from two perspectives. First, the process itself was investigated in terms of the effect of air-blowing conditions on the properties of the asphalt materials obtained. It was found that according to the Superpave specification, very good grade asphalts can be produced by air blowing, and the blowing temperature does not seriously impact the grade span. Asphalt composition has a significant effect on the grade span. The materials with a higher concentration of asphaltenes and saturates have a higher performance grade span. In this work it is shown that the subsequent 88 ? C hardening and oxidation rates are higher for materials blown at higher temperature, and this is not detected by Superpave specifications. Blowing fluxes with a high saturate content may result in a higher grade but can cause subsequent susceptibility to oxidative hardening. The mechanism by which air blowing can affect the 88 ? C hardening rate is related to oxidation kinetics and the tendency of oxidation products to form asphaltenes, causing hardening. For some materials air blown at higher temperatures, the subsequent accelerated hardening rate results from an increase in the oxidation rate, while the hardening susceptibility may actually decrease. The second part of this work deals with {{the development of a new}} procedure for simulation of asphalt short-term aging that occurs at a hot mix asphalt cement plant. The standard tests for simulation of asphalt hot-mix aging are the RTFOT (ASTM D 2872) and the TFOT (ASTM D 1754). They have a number of deficiencies when used for viscous or modified asphalts, such as uneven aging, film formation, and difficulty cleaning laboratory equipment. The air <b>blowing</b> <b>apparatus</b> is a stirred, thermally controlled vessel with an attached condenser. The proposed test eliminates the shortcomings of standard methods. It provides the same aging in a shorter amount of time at lower equipment cost with simplified handling...|$|E
