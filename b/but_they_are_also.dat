5|$|Mysids {{are found}} {{throughout}} the world in both shallow and deep marine waters {{where they can be}} benthic or pelagic, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> important in some fresh water and brackish ecosystems. Many benthic species make daily vertical migrations into higher parts of the water column. Mysids are filter feeders, omnivores that feed on algae, detritus and zooplankton. Some mysids are cultured in the laboratory for experimental purposes and are used as a food source for other cultured marine organisms. They are sensitive to water pollution, so are sometimes used as bioindicators to monitor water quality.|$|E

5|$|Similarities {{between the}} humerus of Hatzegopteryx and Quetzalcoatlus northropi have been noted; {{both have a}} long, smooth deltopectoral crest, and a {{thickened}} humeral head. These were initially {{the basis of the}} taxon's referral to the clade Azhdarchidae, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> similar enough to be a basis for the synonymy of Hatzegopteryx and Quetzalcoatlus. However, this is likely due to the relatively non-diagnostic nature of the humerus in giant azhdarchid taxonomy, and the lack of a detailed description for the elements of Q. northropi. However, the neck and jaw anatomy of Hatzegopteryx is quite clearly distinct from the smaller Q. sp., which warrants the retention of Hatzegopteryx as a taxon separate from Quetzalcoatlus.|$|E

As of October 2010, {{there are three}} such rest area operators on the A1 motorway: INA, OMV and Tifon. The rest area operators {{are not permitted to}} sub-lease the fuel operations; the Tifon-operated rest area has a restaurant and a hotel operated by Marché, a Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts subsidiary, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> penalized if some facilities required by the lease contract are not operating. All of the A6 motorway rest areas, except Ravna Gora, are accessible from one of the directions of the motorway traffic only. The rest areas normally operate 24hours a day, seven days a week.|$|E

25|$|It is {{commonly}} stated by critics of evolution {{that there are}} no known transitional fossils. This position is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of what represents a transitional feature. A common creationist argument is that no fossils are found with partially functional features. It is plausible that a complex feature with one function can adapt a different function through evolution. The precursor to, for example, a wing, might originally have only been used for gliding, trapping flying prey, or mating display. Today, wings can still have all of these functions, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> used in active flight.|$|E
