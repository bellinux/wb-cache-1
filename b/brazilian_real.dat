Argentina did not enjoy a rapid recovery, and the sluggishness of GDP growth fuelled concerns about the sustainability of public debt.|$|E

25|$|The {{removal of}} forest {{to make way}} for cattle {{ranching}} was the leading cause of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon from the mid-1960s. In addition to Vargas's earlier aim for commercial development in the country, the devaluation of the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>real</b> against the dollar had the result of doubling the price of beef in reals and gave ranchers a widespread incentive to increase the size of their cattle ranches and areas under pasture for mass beef production, resulting in large areas of forest removal. Access to clear the forest was facilitated by the land tenure policy in Brazil that meant developers could proceed without restraint and install new cattle ranches which in turn functioned as a qualification for land ownership.|$|E

2500|$|The {{stabilization}} program, called Plano Real {{had three}} stages: {{the introduction of}} an equilibrium budget mandated by the National Congress a process of general indexation (prices, wages, taxes, contracts, and financial assets); {{and the introduction of}} a new currency, the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>real</b> (pegged [...] to the dollar). The legally enforced balanced budget would remove expectations regarding inflationary behavior by the public sector. By allowing a realignment of relative prices, general indexation would pave the way for monetary reform. Once this realignment was achieved, the new currency would be introduced, accompanied by appropriate policies (especially the control of expenditures through high interest rates and the liberalization of trade to increase competition and thus prevent speculative behavior).|$|E

This trend changed in 2009, when both visitors and revenues fell as a result of the Great Recession of 2008–09.

2500|$|Despite {{the sale}} of public assets, the years 1995 to 2002 saw a rise of the total public debt from 30% [...] to 55.5% of GDP. Economists aligned with his {{government}} argued that {{this was due to}} external factors outside the control of the administration at the time, such as the devaluation of the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>real</b> and the growth of the share of the debt denominated in US dollars. Nevertheless, devaluation of the currency was an instrument of monetary policy used right after his reelection, when the real pegged to the dollar led to a financial crisis that saw the country lose much of its foreign reserve fund and raise its interest rates on government bonds to very high levels as he tried to stabilize the currency under a new free-floating regime. With this economic shift, the greatest achievement of Cardoso - his landmark lowering of inflation - was maintained, but his popularity plummeted.|$|E
2500|$|According to the World Tourism Organization (WTO), {{international}} travel to Brazil {{began to grow}} fast since 2000, particularly during 2004 and 2005. However, in 2006 a slow down took place, and international arrivals have had almost no growth both in 2007 and 2008. In spite of this trend, revenues from international tourism continued to rise, from USD 3.9 billion in 2005 to USD 4.9 billion in 2007, a one billion dollar increase despite 333 thousand less arrivals. This favorable trend {{is the result of}} the strong devaluation of the American dollar against the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>real,</b> which began in 2004, but on the other hand, making Brazil a more expensive international destination. This trend changed in 2009, when both visitors and revenues fell as a result of the 2008-2009 economic crisis. By 2010 the industry recovered, and arrivals grew above 2006 levels to 5.16 million international visitors, and receipts from these visitors reached USD 5.9 billion.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a stable common currency for mid-sized open monetary economies with incomplete markets {{in general and}} the Mercosur countries in particular. The proposed currency is constructed as a derivative of a dynamic portfolio of securities that proxies the nominal exchange risk factors for a set of monies and floats against the rest of the world’s currencies. We find that the resulting optimal common currency is comprised of currencies with country weights that are statistically significant and fairly symmetrical with relatively equal weight (e. g., 22 % Argentinean pesos, 27 % <b>Brazilian</b> <b>reals,</b> 27 % Chilean pesos, and 23 % Uruguayan pesos). We also find that increasing the number of countries in a common currency tends to increase its stability. The willingness of Mercosur countries to participate in a monetary union is assessed from statistical moments of the density functions of the implied stable common currency and its components. stable common currency, open monetary economies, regime switching models, Mercosur, currency basket...|$|R
