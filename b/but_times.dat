25|$|Later in Tasmania, Close {{was ordered}} to play despite doctor's advice to rest, and {{as he tried to}} nurse his injury he {{acquired}} a reputation for malingering and insubordination. He was made to play in six of the next seven games. When England won a Test match in Australia {{for the first time in}} 13years in the final Test, Close was not present. Nowadays, someone in Close's position would be carefully man-managed, and looked after by captain and team manager. <b>But</b> <b>times</b> were different then, and the Yorkshire stalwarts were proved right: he had been picked too early, and would never be a regular Test player.|$|E

Debs thereafter stated that he had opposed the amendment, but that once it was adopted it should be obeyed. Debs remained friendly to Haywood and the IWW after the expulsion, despite their perceived differences over IWW tactics.|$|E

2500|$|Interplay {{actually}} {{wants to}} do the game right! We've been talking about a game now for two years. They {{want me to be}} involved, <b>but</b> <b>times</b> in games are tough right now for everyone. They have to raise {{a lot of money to}} fund the game properly... In our early discussions about the game, we had tentatively brainstormed ideas for the Wii. That is NOT a confirmation like the guy posted. We haven't presented the idea to Nintendo... As with anything in the gaming industry, the whole thing could turn on a dime and many of the facts can change about the game. What these fans don’t understand is how squirly things are at the beginning of the game. It would take at least two years to bring out the game and that’s after we’ve confirmed the budget and platform. The game could just as easily go away, get moved to the iPhone or become a Jim Tetris knock off as come out as a game on the Wii. People don’t understand how unstable game design is at the start" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{play was}} a {{moderate}} success, <b>but</b> <b>times</b> were hard. Many Broadway theaters {{had been converted}} to movie houses and the Depression was reaching bottom. [...] "From 1932 through 1934", Stewart later recalled, [...] "I'd only worked three months. Every play I got into folded." [...] By 1934, he was given more substantial stage roles, including the modest hit Page Miss Glory and his first dramatic stage role in Sidney Howard's Yellow Jack, which convinced him to continue his acting career. However, Stewart and Fonda, still roommates, were both struggling. In the fall of 1934, Fonda's success in The Farmer Takes a Wife took him to Hollywood. Finally, Stewart attracted the interest of MGM scout Bill Grady who saw Stewart on the opening night of Divided by Three, a glittering première with many luminaries in attendance, including Irving Berlin, Moss Hart and Fonda, who had returned to New York for the show. With Fonda's encouragement, Stewart agreed to take a screen test, after which he {{signed a contract with}} MGM in April 1935, as a contract player for up to seven years at $350 a week.|$|E

[...] At that time, college athletics was almost exclusively {{the realm of}} the male student athlete, <b>but</b> <b>times</b> {{were on the verge of}} change. On October 4, 1972, SIUE's first women's team took the field, as women's athletic director and coach Rosemarie Archangel's field hockey team played and won its first game. Field hockey has since been discontinued, and other sports have come and gone. Until 2007, when the university began the transition to [...] Division I, SIUE had competed in Division II, except in men's soccer, which competed in Division I from 1973 through 1995. [...] From 1994 to 2008, the Cougars were members of the Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC) after having previously been an independent. As part of the move to Division I, the Cougars joined the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) in 2008. The 2011–12 season was the Cougars' first campaigns for the OVC regular season titles, although they were not eligible for post-season play until 2012–13 except in softball and men's soccer, which were [...] "fast-tracked" [...] by the NCAA.|$|E
