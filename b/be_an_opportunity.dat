Huntsman said the critics were overreacting to Trump's decision to accept the phone call, and that Trump's nontraditional style might <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for a shift in Asia relations in future talks with China.|$|E
5|$|Although Bo was {{initially}} unhappy about his reassignment in Chongqing, he soon resolved {{to use his}} new position as a staging ground {{for a return to}} higher national office. Bo made no secret of his desire to enter the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) during the 18th Party Congress in autumn 2012, as all but two of the PSC members—including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao—were expected to retire. The transition would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for Bo to join the highest echelon of national leadership, likely as a replacement for ally Zhou Yongkang, secretary of the Central Political and Legislative Committee, serving {{as the head of the}} party's security apparatus.|$|E
5|$|On the Union side, Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, Grant's {{superior}} {{as commander}} of the Department of the Missouri, was also apprehensive. Halleck had authorized Grant to capture Fort Henry, but now he felt that continuing to Fort Donelson was risky. Despite Grant's success to date, Halleck had little confidence in him, considering Grant to be reckless. Halleck attempted to convince his own rival, Don Carlos Buell, to take command of the campaign to get his additional forces engaged. Despite Johnston's high regard for Buell, the Union general was as passive as Grant was aggressive. Grant never suspected his superiors were considering relieving him, but he was well aware that any delay or reversal might <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for Halleck to lose his nerve and cancel the operation.|$|E

5|$|On the {{day prior}} to the game, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by 11.5 points. Despite that advantage, Tech head coach Frank Beamer warned his team and {{the public about the}} threat underdog Air Force posed to the Hokies' chances of winning. Both Beamer and Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry were among the longest-tenured coaches in college {{football}} at the time. DeBerry had been a college coach for 19years, while Beamer had coached for 16 years. The game would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for DeBerry to gain his 150th career win and defeat a ranked team {{for the first time since}} 1999. Ticket sales {{prior to the}} game were sluggish, as both teams failed to sell out their assigned allotments, and local sales registered fewer than 8,000tickets sold. In addition, local media coverage of the game was very sparse.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{arrives at}} Ornara, and Sobi and Langor {{have agreed to}} provide the Felicium to the Ornarans for later payment. However, Picard announces that as the Prime Directive {{prevents}} him from interfering in the transactions between the two planets, it also prevents him from providing any replacement parts for the aging freighters. T'Jon and Romas are furious at the decision as {{it means that the}} trade between Ornara and Brekka will stop because the freighters can no longer make the trips without the parts. After the four are transported off the Enterprise, Picard confides to Dr. Crusher that while the Ornarans may suffer from withdrawal symptoms in the short term, this will <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for both races to advance in their own ways.|$|E

The two sides were going to discuss topics such as nuclear arms reduction and also how to deal with increasing tensions surrounding Berlin. According to Eisenhower, {{had it not been for}} the U-2 incident the summit and his visit to the Soviet Union could have greatly helped Soviet and American relations.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the public’s outcry, McKinley took action against Spain. On April 25, the United States declared war. America claimed to have had no self-serving interest in Cuba, but some political and military leaders and imperialists did believe the war would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for the United States to expand territories overseas and to demonstrate its increasing naval power against a weak foe. Moreover, the United States sought to expand economic ties with Cuba for its resources in sugar and tobacco, all of which influenced America’s decision to intervene. It was evident that gaining territories across the globe would increase the strength and influence of the United States and tap markets for the products of American industry.|$|E
25|$|Medicare {{finds itself}} in the odd {{position}} of having assumed control of graduate medical education, currently facing major budget constraints, and as a result, freezing funding for graduate medical education, {{as well as for}} physician reimbursement rates. This halt in funding in turn exacerbates the exact problem Medicare sought to solve in the first place: improving the availability of medical care. However, some healthcare administration experts believe that the shortage of physicians may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for providers to reorganize their delivery systems to become less costly and more efficient. Physicians' assistants and Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners may begin assuming more responsibilities that traditionally fell to doctors, but do not necessarily require the advanced training and skill of a physician.|$|E

In February, he would lose the 4FW tag championships with partner Jason Larusso, effectively ending the team. Ryan would focus primarily on singles competition and receive wins against Chris Dickinson, Kelly Sixx and Joshua Knott, before winning the 3rd Annual PWP Prizefighters Tournament; defeating Lomaxx in the final and gaining a PWP Heavyweight Championship opportunity. This would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> that he would lose, at PWP Pride & Glory 2016; but would win the championship in the following show PWP One of a kind, besting Steve Griffiths on a megashow featuring Rob Van Dam, in Taunton, England.|$|E
25|$|In {{obedience}} to the Books of Destiny, some strange and unusual sacrifices were made, human sacrifices amongst them. A Gaulish man and a Gaulish woman and a Greek man and a Greek woman were buried alive under the Forum Boarium... They were lowered into a stone vault, which had on a previous occasion also been polluted by human victims, a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings. When the gods {{were believed to be}} duly propitiated... Armour, weapons, and other things of the kind were ordered to be in readiness, and the ancient spoils gathered from the enemy were taken down from the temples and colonnades. The dearth of freemen necessitated a new kind of enlistment; 8,000 sturdy youths from amongst the slaves were armed at the public cost, after they had each been asked whether they were willing to serve or no. These soldiers were preferred, as there would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> of ransoming them when taken prisoners at a lower price.|$|E
25|$|Four 40-meter high {{floodlights}} {{were installed}} in the stadium in 1958, making evening matches possible. The lights were inaugurated with an exhibition match against Anderlecht. In 1977, the main stand was completely rebuilt, but an alkali–silica reaction ten years later caused the concrete to crack. Chairman Jacques Ruts, who was previously introduced to the skybox in the United States, considered a new stand to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to attract more sponsors. The new main stand – two tiers, with skyboxes in the middle – was introduced in a friendly match against Milan in 1988. In the nineties, the other three stands are also elevated. The last major renovation was {{the closing of the}} four open corners of the stadium. Along with creating more seats, the new corners had window blind-type constructions, which allowed air to flow through in order to let the grass breath. The completion was celebrated in October 2002, with the capacity increased to 35,000. In the summer of 2005, the club removed the tall fences around the pitch, replacing them with lower railings keeping the spectators off the grass. Unauthorized persons who do invade the pitch will receive a €15,000 penalty and a ten-year-ban from visiting the ground.|$|E

While Hall noted that he had a great father as a child, he felt the message needed to be conveyed to dads. Hall and the band wrote the song in about two days, in order to get it done prior to an annual NASCAR event held by their church. The band felt that the event, attended by around two to three thousand families, would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to convey that message.|$|E

Having decided to proceed, he undertook extensive research before he began the painting. In early 1818, he met with 2 survivors: Henri Savigny, a surgeon, and Alexandre Corréard, an engineer from the École nationale supérieure d'arts et métiers. Their emotional descriptions of their experiences largely inspired the tone of the final painting. According to the art historian Georges-Antoine Borias, [...] "Géricault established his studio across from Beaujon hospital. And here began a mournful descent. Behind locked doors he threw himself into his work. Nothing repulsed him. He was dreaded and avoided." ...|$|E

In {{response to a question}} on February 4, regarding the discussions about civility in politics Kelly said: [...] "I haven’t {{spent a lot of time}} following that, but I think that with something that was so horrible and so negative, and the fact that six people lost their lives including a nine-year-old girl, a federal judge, Gabby’s staff member Gabe—who was like a younger brother to her—it’s really really a sad situation. I am hopeful that something positive can come out of it. I think that will happen, so those are good things." ...|$|E
500|$|Norwegians were {{undecided}} about {{hosting a}} Winter Olympics.

[...] But the organizers believed the 1952 Games could <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to promote national unity and {{to show the world}} that Norway had recovered from the war. [...] Vying with Oslo for the right to host the Games were Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, and Lake Placid, United States. [...] The IOC voted to award the 1952 Winter Games to Oslo on 21June1947 at the 40th IOC Session in Stockholm, Sweden. [...] Later, Cortina d'Ampezzo was awarded the 1956 Games, and Lake Placid—which had hosted the 1932 Winter Olympics—was chosen to host the 1980 Winter Games. Norway became the first Scandinavian country to host a Winter Olympics, and the 1952 Winter Games were the first to be held in a nation's capital.|$|E
500|$|In late 1963, Eastwood's co-star on Rawhide, Eric Fleming, {{rejected}} {{an offer}} to star in an Italian-made western called A Fistful of Dollars, to be directed in a remote region of Spain by the then relatively unknown Sergio Leone. Richard Harrison suggested Eastwood to Leone because Harrison knew Eastwood could play a cowboy convincingly. Eastwood thought the film would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to escape from his Rawhide image. Eastwood signed a contract for $15,000 in wages for elevenweeks' work, with a bonus of a Mercedes automobile upon completion. Eastwood later spoke of {{the transition from a}} television western to A Fistful of Dollars: [...] "In Rawhide I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat. The hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. I {{decided it was time to}} be an anti-hero." [...] Eastwood was instrumental in creating the Man with No Name character's distinctive visual style and, although a non-smoker, Leone insisted Eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the [...] "mask" [...] he was attempting to create for the loner character.|$|E
