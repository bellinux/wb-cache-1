5|$|As he {{had done}} for other Adventures of Tintin which {{featured}} sea travel, Hergé was careful to obtain as much data about ships as possible {{in order to make}} his portrayals more realistic. The design of the Aurora was based on the RRS William Scoresby, while that of the Peary was most likely based upon another Antarctic ship, the RRS Discovery. The seaplane on which the expedition travels was based on the German Arado 196-A. Hergé nevertheless later criticised his own efforts in this area, saying that if Aurora had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> ship, it would probably be unseaworthy.|$|E

25|$|The most {{conspicuous}} case {{and one which}} {{has given rise to}} long-standing debate is Alba Longa. The location of that famous city, according to tradition founded by Ascanius and the metropolis of the Latins for 418 years, is still a mystery. Some scholars have argued that it has not yet been identified because the Ancients themselves did not know exactly where it was located and the reason for their ignorance was that Alba had never <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> city. It would rather have been a loose collection of small and sparsely populated protohistoric villages organised in the Bronze Age custom around the sanctuary of Mount Albanus and abandoned before it reached the urban stage.|$|E

25|$|La Tosca {{is set in}} Rome on 17 June 1800 {{following}} the French victory in the Battle of Marengo. The action takes place over an eighteen-hour period, ending at dawn on 18 June 1800. Its melodramatic plot centers on Floria Tosca, a celebrated opera singer; her lover, Mario Cavaradossi, an artist and Napoleon sympathiser; and Baron Scarpia, Rome's ruthless Regent of Police. By {{the end of the}} play, all three are dead. Scarpia arrests Cavaradossi and sentences him to death in the Castel Sant'Angelo. He then offers to spare her lover if Tosca will yield to his sexual desire. She appears to acquiesce, but as soon as Scarpia gives the order for the firing squad to use blanks, she stabs him to death. On discovering that Cavaradossi's execution had in fact <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> one, Tosca commits suicide by throwing herself from the castle's parapets.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{essential}} sources Philostratus claimed to know are the “memoirs” (or “diary”) of Damis, an acolyte and companion of Apollonius. Some scholars claim that the notebooks of Damis were an invention of Philostratus, while others think it could have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> book forged by someone else and naively used by Philostratus. Philostratus describes Apollonius as a wandering teacher of philosophy and miracle-worker who was mainly active in Greece and Asia Minor but also traveled to Italy, Spain, and North Africa, and even to Mesopotamia, India, and Ethiopia. In particular, he tells lengthy stories of Apollonius entering the city of Rome in disregard of emperor Nero’s ban on philosophers, and later on being summoned, as a defendant, {{to the court of}} Domitian, where he defied the emperor in blunt terms. He had allegedly been accused of conspiring against the emperor, performing human sacrifice, and predicting a plague by means of magic. Philostratus implies that upon his death, Apollonius of Tyana underwent heavenly assumption.|$|E
25|$|On 24 September, Menshikov {{began to}} move his army out of Sevastopol towards Bakchi Serai and Simferopol, leaving Admirals Kornilov and Nakhimov to organise the 18,000-strong {{garrison}} (mainly sailors and marines) and prepare the port's defences. By venturing into {{the interior of the}} Crimea, Menshikov would not only keep open his communications with Russia, but would also be in touch with reinforcements from Odessa or Kertch; moreover, he would be free to operate in the field and threaten the Allied flank. Whilst Menshikov moved east, the Anglo-French-Turkish army, with the British in the vanguard, continued its march towards the southern coast of the peninsula. The heat was oppressive, the water sparse, and cholera rife, taking a heavy toll on the men including Saint-Arnaud who was already ill with cancer. The march had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> trial and was not without incident. At one point, on 25 September near MacKenzie's Farm, Raglan and his staff in front of the British column stumbled across the rear of the retreating Russians; {{with the rest of his}} army strung out behind in hopeless disorder, Menshikov missed a chance to inflict a major reverse on the British. By the 26th, however, Raglan had reached the village of Kadikoi, and was able to look down on the narrow inlet of Balaclava. That same day Saint-Arnaud, now critically ill, surrendered his command to General Canrobert.|$|E

25|$|The {{most notorious}} {{criminal}} {{of the period}} (aside from the Nazis and their collaborators) was Doctor Marcel Petiot. Petiot purchased a house at 21 rue Le Sueur in the 16th arrondissement, and {{under the name of}} Docteur Eugène, pretended to be the head of a Resistance network that smuggled Jews from France to Argentina. He collected a large advance from his clients and then instructed them to come to his house, bringing their gold, silver and other valuables with them. After they arrived, he brought them to his consulting room, and, convincing them vaccination was required in order to enter Argentina, gave them a lethal intravenous injection, then watched their slow death in an adjacent room through a spyhole in the door. Afterwards, he cut up their bodies, put the pieces in the well, and dissolved them with quicklime. His activities attracted the attention of the Gestapo, which arrested him in 1943, thus allowing him to claim later that he had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> member of the Resistance. His crimes were discovered after the Liberation in 1944, and he was charged with the murders of twenty-seven persons, tried in 1946, and sentenced to death. He went to the guillotine on May 25, 1946. The gold, silver and other valuables were not found when he was arrested. In search of the treasure, the house was carefully demolished in 1966, but no trace of it was ever found.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{above-mentioned}} orders of Feldzeugmeister Ludwig von Welden, the Imperial troops finished on 23 April {{the evacuation of}} Pest, in which at 25 April General Lajos Aulich entered with the II. Hungarian corps. Welden ordered to the brigade led by Major General Franz Wyss to move to Tata, to the brigade led by Major General Franz de Paula Gundaccar II. von Colloredo-Mannsfeld to retreat from Esztergom to Dorog, to the Schwarzenberg division to move from Buda to Esztergom, retreating the Austrian troops from {{the region of the}} Danube Bend (except the garrison of Buda, led by Major General Heinrich Hentzi) and concentrating them around and near Komárom, to be deployable in the eventuality of a battle at Komárom. Welden finally understood that the Hungarian forces which were East from Pest (the II. corps led by Aulich), represented not an overwhelming force, which could have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> treat to the imperials, if they retreated from their secured positions from Pest and the Danube Bend towards Komárom. This is why they could concentrate their forces around Komárom, to withstand against the main Hungarian forces preparing to attack them there. But Görgei hoped that his plan of misleading the Imperials was still working at that moment, this is why he ordered the crossing of the Danube, to attack the Austrian forces concentrated there, hoping to use his supposed numerical superiority to destroy them, and to encircle with this the forces which he thought were still in the Danube Bend. He was warned, among others by his chief of the general staff Colonel József Bayer, that crossing the Danube to South is a very risky plan, but Görgei did not change his mind.|$|E
