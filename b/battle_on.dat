5|$|According to Njal's Saga, Óspak was on {{the wing}} {{opposite}} King Sigtrygg Silkbeard. Óspak went through the entire <b>battle</b> <b>on</b> this wing, and was sorely wounded and lost both his sons before Sigtrygg fled. However, that Óspak engaged Sigtrygg contradicts the historical opinion that Sigtrygg did not actually {{take part in the}} battle but was instead holding the garrison in reserve in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>battle</b> <b>on</b> the {{southern}} {{side of the}} Shangani was over, Forbes and his column conducted a cursory search for survivors from Wilson's party, but, unable to cross the river, could see nothing {{to tell them what}} had happened. Guessing (correctly) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed, they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion, their supplies all but gone and the Matabele impeding their progress at every turn.|$|E
5|$|Alexis Helmer, a close friend, {{was killed}} during the <b>battle</b> <b>on</b> May 2.

5|$|As {{the battle}} at Tithwal {{continued}} for months, the Pakistanis grew desperate {{and launched a}} massive attack on 13 October, hoping to drive the Indians from their positions. Their primary objective was to capture the Richhmar Gali, located south of Tithwal, and the Nastachur Pass, east of Tithwal. During the fierce <b>battle</b> <b>on</b> the night of 13 October at Richhmar Gali, Lance Naik Singh was commanding a 1SIKH forward post.|$|E

5|$|His {{refusal to}} accept {{anything}} short of total victory was pivotal in the final outcome. His tenacity was well-paid {{with the news that}} López had died in <b>battle</b> <b>on</b> 1 March 1870, bringing the war to a close. PedroII turned down the General Assembly's suggestion to erect an equestrian statue of him to commemorate the victory and chose instead to use the money to build elementary schools.|$|E
5|$|In a <b>battle</b> <b>on</b> January 23, 971, massive arrow {{fire from}} Song dynasty crossbowmen {{decimated}} the war elephant corps of the Southern Han army.

5|$|Pyrrhus {{attempted}} to goad Antigonus into fighting a pitched <b>battle</b> <b>on</b> the plain {{in front of}} Argos but the Macedonian king was unmoved. The Argives sent ambassadors to both kings, beseeching them to respect the city's neutrality. Antigonus agreed to the Argives' terms and gave his son as a hostage in order to demonstrate his sincerity. While Pyrrhus agreed to retreat from Argos, he failed to give a pledge {{and as a result}} was regarded with suspicion.|$|E
