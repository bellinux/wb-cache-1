Polychlorinated biphenyls were once used as cooling and insulating fluids and polybrominated biphenyls are flame retardants. The biphenyl motif also appears in {{drugs such as}} diflunisal and telmisartan. The abbreviation E7 stands for a liquid crystal mixture consisting of several cyanobiphenyls with long aliphatic tails used commercially in liquid crystal displays. A variety of <b>benzidine</b> <b>derivatives</b> are used in dyes and polymers.

Besides glucose oxidase, the test kit contains a <b>benzidine</b> <b>derivative,</b> which is oxidized to a blue polymer by the hydrogen peroxide formed in the oxidation reaction. The disadvantage of this method was that the test strip had to be developed after a precise interval (the blood had to be washed away), and the meter needed to be calibrated frequently.|$|R
30|$|Electroluminescence was {{observed}} for the layered structures containing the transparent anode of the indium-tin oxide (ITO), organic hole-transporting layer, luminescence layer {{of one of}} the studied complexes, and the metallic cathode of Al:Ca (5 %) alloy. The hole-transporting materials used were triaryl derivatives - well-known naphthyl-substituted <b>benzidine</b> <b>derivative</b> (NPD) and the oligomer of triphenylamine oligo(4, 4 '-(4 ''-methyl)triphenylamine) (PTA) [22]. The carbazol derivative 4, 4 '-bis(N-carbazolyl)- 1, 1 '-biphenyl (CBP) and poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) were also used for forming the hole-transporting layer. The structures of these compounds are shown in Figure 1. All the materials are characterized by blue PL 450 to 470 nm [18 – 21]. Zinc complexes and PTA were synthesized as described elsewhere [18 – 22]. NPD, CBP, and PEDOT:PSS were supplied by Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich Rus LLC, Moscow, Russia). All the organic layers in the OLED devices (except PTA and PEDOT:PSS) were prepared by vacuum evaporation. PTA and PEDOT:PSS were spin casted from toluene and aqueous solutions, respectively. The EL and PL spectra were measured with the Ocean Optics fiber optics spectrometers QE 65000 or PC 1000 (Eurolase Ltd., Moscow, Russia). LED with λ = 370 nm was used to excite the PL.|$|R
30|$|Industrial {{effluent}} treatment is a provocative operation to restraint water contamination and to sustain ecosystem [1, 2]. Azo dyes are a renowned class of coloring compounds which are comprehensively {{been used in}} engineering applications. Congo red, a cationic dye, is <b>benzidine</b> <b>derivative</b> of azo dye and its structure is very stable. Even a slight concentration of the dye is revealed to be a foremost environmental threat [3, 4]. Exposure to MB leads to increase of heart beat, vomiting, shock, jaundice, quadriplegia, and tissue necrosis in humans [5, 6]. Various methods such as ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, coagulation, sedimentation chemical oxidation, membrane separation processes, electrochemical, aerobic, anaerobic microbial degradation, etc. are accessible for waste water handling; however, these methods have limitations such as formation of inferior waste products which have to be further treated. Further, these procedures are time spending and price demanding [7, 8, 9]. In this regard, the adsorption procedure is an efficient approach to take out pollutants present in the effluent water. Since the water management by adsorption method is entirely dependent on excellence of the adsorbent, the improvement of effective and low-cost sorbent materials is challenging task before material chemists. In the previous years, number of adsorbents such as activated carbon, zeolites, clay minerals, chitosan, lignocelluloses, biosorbents and functionalized polymers have been employed; however, maximum of these materials are either not economic and effective or have associated difficulties of separation and generation of secondary wastes [10, 11, 12, 13, 14].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{applicability}} of DFT-based descriptors {{for the development}} of toxicological structure– activity relationships is assessed. Emphasis in the present study is on the quality of DFT-based descrip-tors {{for the development of}} toxicological QSARs and, more specifically, on the potential of the electrophili-city concept in predicting toxicity of <b>benzidine</b> <b>derivatives</b> and the series of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) expressed in terms of their biological activity data (pIC 50). First, two <b>benzidine</b> <b>derivatives,</b> which act as electron-donating agents in their interactions with biomolecules are considered. Overall toxicity in general and the most probable site of reactivity in particular are effectively described by the global and local electrophilicity parameters respectively. Interaction of two <b>benzidine</b> <b>derivatives</b> with nucleic acid (NA) bases/selected base pairs is determined using Parr’s charge transfer formula. The experimental bio-logical activity data (pIC 50) for the family of PAH, namely polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF), poly-halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PHDD) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) are taken as dependent variables and the HF energy (E), along with DFT-based global and local descriptors, viz., electrophilicity index (w) and local electrophilic power (w+) respectively are taken as independent variables. Fairly good correlation is obtained showing the significance of the selected descriptors in the QSAR on toxins that act as electron acceptors in the presence of biomolecules.

40|$|Primary role of {{peroxidase}} enzyme is {{to decompose}} endogenous hydrogen peroxide, when oxygen radical is {{being replaced by}} a less potent radical, which is its cosubstrates oxidized form. During this study, catalytic activity of horseradish peroxidase has been observed {{in the presence of}} antioxidants from vitamin group, such as C, E and A, i. e. their water-soluble forms. It was found that vitamin E showed no effect on the enzyme activity and fate of cosubstrate radicals from the group of <b>benzidine</b> <b>derivatives.</b> Vitamin C proceeds enzymatic reaction showing its antioxidative character, and absorbs electrons from radicals, bringing cosubstrate back to its relaxed state. On the other hand, vitamin A plays a role of uncompetitive peroxidase inhibitor, which is visible through decreasing initial rate of catalytic reaction, and is reflected as virtual decrease of enzyme concentration. Furthermore, it prolongs life of endogenous hydrogen peroxide, which could potentially lead to oxidative stress of cells. This inhibitory effect can be used in analytical purpose, for determination of retinol acetate content in a sample...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} the massive {{accumulation}} of scientific evi-dence during more than {{three quarters of a}} century and the concerted efforts of many nations of over half a century, <b>benzidine</b> and its <b>derivatives</b> continue to be produced and used {{in many parts of the}} world. Thou-sands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of workers have been exposed to this carcinogen. They are largely unaware at the time of exposure. They remain unin-formed and unaided in dealing with persistent haz-ardous conditions and with suffering and death that may result. FINDINGS 1. Benzidine and its salts, as well as benzidine-con-taining products, should be regarded as strong human carcinogens. The carcinogenic effect is further con-firmed by animal data and supported by studies on bacteria and mammalian cells, as well as by in vivo and in vitro data on the DNA-binding and DNA-damaging capacity of benzidine. 2. Benzidine, its salts and benzidine-containing prod-ucts constitute an unnecessary and preventable hazard to exposed people and these compounds and many of their products have been strictly regulated in many countries. No evidence has been offered to indicate that the general welfare would be harmed by the elim-ination of these chemicals from commerce. 3. The Collegium urges these examples of regulation to be followed by all countries in order to protect workers from risk of cancer of the urinary bladder and, perhaps also, of other organs. All countries should take appropriate steps to end all further human exposure. 4. The Collegium considers the practice of shifting production of benzidine and benzidine-based dyes from developed to undeveloped countries unaccept-able international behaviour that raises serious moral questions about those who engage in such practices. 5. Countries that already stringently control benzidine, its salts and benzidine-containing products should request reciprocal international action, such as through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or uni-laterally prohibit the import of goods manufactured with the use of <b>benzidine</b> and its <b>derivatives.</b> 6. Substituting <b>benzidine</b> with other related chemicals, such as 3, 3 ’dichlorobenzidine, which may also exhibit potent carcinogenic properties, would be unnecessary and unacceptable...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} {{carcinogenicity}} and mutagenicity data on azo dyes {{used in the}} leather industry. Two water soluble benzidine-based dyes were classified as "probably carcinogenic to humans" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). No other dyes have been evaluated by the IARC. Of the 48 azo dyes assayed in the Salmonella/microsome test, 20 gave positive results. Attention is drawn to {{the important role of}} the in vivo metabolism of azo compounds, which includes a preliminary reduction of the azo bonds and subsequent release of the aromatic amines of the dye. A useful assay (Prival test) for evaluating the mutagenic properties of azo dyes involves a reductive step that permits the release of any genotoxic agents present in the compounds. A list of leather azo dyes is furnished that are considered as potentially harmful due to the presence of a carcinogenic aromatic amine (<b>benzidine,</b> p-aminobenzene and <b>derivatives)</b> in their formulae...|$|R
40|$|Mouse {{lymphocytes}} {{were exposed}} in vitro for 2 h or in vivo for 24 h to benzidine and related aromatic amines {{to test for}} chromosome aberrations (CA) and mitotic indices. Uninduced mouse S 9 was used to activate the amines for the in vitro tests {{to be consistent with}} the in vivo tests. Contrary to a previous report, no difference could be established in the genotoxicity of benzidine following activation with uninduced S 9 compared to induced S 9. There were concentration related increases in CA for benzidine and all the amines in vitro except for 4, 4 '-diaminostilbene which exhibited the greatest cellular toxicity towards cultured lymphocytes. <b>Benzidine</b> and its <b>derivatives</b> showed significant increases in CA in vivo compared to its negative control. The CA values for 4 -aminostilbene were significantly higher than the other amines in both in vivo and in vitro studies. These genotoxicity results for 4 -aminostilbene are consistent with our previous report of the pronounced CA effects in murine bone-marrow cells but would not be predicted from Salmonella mutagenicity tests...|$|R
40|$|Benzidine and its 3, 3 '-diamino, 3, 3 '-dimethyl, 3, 3 '-dimethoxy, 3, 3 '-difluoro, 3, 3 '-dichloro, 3, 3 '-dibromo, 3, 3 '-dicarbomethoxy and 3, 3 '-dinitro {{derivatives}} {{together with}} 2 -nitrobenzidine and 3 -nitrobenzidine were compared for their in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity. Relative mutagenicity was established with Salmonella strains TA 98, TA 98 / 1, 8 -DNP 6 and TA 100 {{with and without}} S 9 activation. All the derivatives {{in the presence of}} S 9 were more mutagenic than benzidine with 3, 3 '-dinitro- and 3 -nitro-benzidine having the greatest mutagenicity. Mutagenicity in all 3 strains with S 9 activation could be correlated to electron-withdrawing ability of substituent groups, as measured by the basicity of the amines. This correlation was explained on the basis that electron-withdrawing groups could favor the stability of the mutagenic intermediate N-hydroxylamine and also enhance the reactivity of the ultimate mutagenic species, the nitrenium ion. Mutagenicity was also correlated to the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (ELUMO). Hydrophobicity was found to have very limited effect on the relative mutagenicity of our <b>benzidine</b> <b>derivatives.</b> The in vivo endpoint was chromosomal aberrations in the bone-marrow cells of mice following intraperitoneal administration of benzidine and its derivatives. In contrast to the in vitro results, while all the amines were genotoxic in vivo, only the 3 -nitro derivative had a significant increase in toxicity over benzidine...|$|E
40|$|In {{immunological}} {{studies of}} mycoplasmas, {{the use of}} glutaraldehyde for the fixative {{makes it possible to}} use erythrocytes from commercially available defibrinated sheep blood. It eliminates the necessity of having to screen blood from individual sheep to obtain a suitable source of erythrocytes, as when employing tannic acid for fixation and sensitization. The chemical bonding of soluble mycoplasma proteins to glutaraladehyde-fixed sheep erythrocytes by bis-diazotized 3, 3 ′dimethoxy <b>derivative,</b> <b>benzidine,</b> yields preparations that are satisfactory antigens for performing the indirect hemagglutination test by the microtiter technique.
