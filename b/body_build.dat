25|$|Some horse breeds are {{not defined}} as ponies, {{even when they}} have some animals that measure under 14.2 hands. This is usually due to <b>body</b> <b>build,</b> {{traditional}} uses and overall physiology. Breeds that are considered horses regardless of height include the Arabian horse, American Quarter Horse and the Morgan horse, {{all of which have}} individual members both over and under 14.2 hands.|$|E
25|$|Surgically, {{the breast}} is an apocrine gland {{overlaying}} the chest — attached at the nipple and suspended with ligaments from the chest — which {{is integral to}} the skin, the body integument of the woman. The dimensions and weight of the breasts vary with her age and habitus (<b>body</b> <b>build</b> and physical constitution); hence small-to-medium-sized breasts weigh approximately 500 gm, or less, and large breasts weigh approximately 750–1,000 gm. Anatomically, the breast topography and the hemispheric locale of the nipple-areola complex (NAC) are particular to each woman; thus, the desirable, average measurements are a 21–23cm sternal distance (nipple to sternum-bone notch), and a 5–7cm inferior-limb distance (NAC to IMF).|$|E

25|$|Users report {{feelings}} of relaxation, sharpness, calmness, and alertness. Those new to smoking may experience nausea, dizziness, increased blood pressure, narrowed arteries, and rapid heart beat. Generally, the unpleasant symptoms will eventually vanish over time, with repeated use, as the <b>body</b> <b>builds</b> a tolerance to the {{chemicals in the}} cigarettes, such as nicotine.|$|R
50|$|Bus {{manufacture}} historically {{developed as}} chassis and <b>body</b> <b>builds.</b> Often, large bus operators or authorities would maintain separate stocks of bus bodies, and would routinely refurbish buses {{in a central}} works, and refurbished chassis might receive a different body. One of the first integral type bus designs combining the body and chassis was the AEC Routemaster.|$|R
50|$|The most {{pressing}} issue {{relates to the}} data used to average facial tissue thickness. The data available to forensic artists are still very limited in ranges of ages, sexes, and <b>body</b> <b>builds.</b> This disparity greatly affects the accuracy of reconstructions. Until this data is expanded, the likelihood of producing the most accurate reconstruction possible is largely limited.|$|R
2500|$|The average horse {{can carry}} up to {{approximately}} 25% {{of its body}} weight, but <b>body</b> <b>build</b> and, particularly, back structure, may allow it to carry somewhat more or less. [...] Physical condition also plays a role. [...] A horse that is in good physical condition, with well-developed abdominal and back muscles, {{will be able to}} carry more weight for a longer time than one that is not in shape.|$|E
2500|$|This {{atherosclerotic}} disease process, over decades, {{leads to}} myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. Since higher blood LDL, especially higher LDL particle concentrations and smaller LDL particle size, {{contribute to this}} process more than the cholesterol content of the HDL particles, LDL particles are often termed [...] "bad cholesterol" [...] {{because they have been}} linked to atheroma formation. On the other hand, high concentrations of functional HDL, which can remove cholesterol from cells and atheroma, offer protection and are sometimes referred to as [...] "good cholesterol". These balances are mostly genetically determined, but can be changed by <b>body</b> <b>build,</b> medications, food choices, and other factors.|$|E
2500|$|... {{generations of}} gene flow obliterated {{whatever}} clear-cut physical distinctions may have once existed {{between these two}} Bantu peoples – renowned to be height, <b>body</b> <b>build,</b> and facial features. With a spectrum of physical variation in the peoples, Belgian authorities legally mandated ethnic affiliation in the 1920s, based on economic criteria. Formal and discrete social divisions were consequently imposed upon ambiguous biological distinctions. To some extent, the permeability of these categories in the intervening decades helped to reify the biological distinctions, generating a taller elite and a shorter underclass, but with little relation to the gene pools that had existed a few centuries ago. The social categories are thus real, {{but there is little}} if any detectable genetic differentiation between Hutu and Tutsi.|$|E
50|$|In the African-American slave community, slaves quickly {{familiarized}} {{themselves with}} funeral procedures {{and the location}} of gravesites of family and friends. Specific slaves were assigned to prepare dead <b>bodies,</b> <b>build</b> coffins, dig graves, and construct headstones. Slave funerals were typically at night when the workday was over, with the master present to view all the ceremonial procedures. Slaves from nearby plantations were regularly in attendance.|$|R
50|$|From the 1970s, Eric’s sons Mike and David {{began running}} the business, which was by now {{expanding}} with four new chassis per year. The business {{at this time}} was mainly expanding through its excursion services, which used continental-style coach <b>bodies</b> <b>build</b> on traditional British chassis. However, by the late 1970s the company had bought its first Neoplan chassis, which prepared it for the expansion possibilities bought about by the Transport Act 1980.|$|R

2500|$|Patients {{with the}} chronic, {{congenital}} form of SMA syndrome predominantly have a lengthy or even lifelong history of abdominal complaints with intermittent exacerbations {{depending on the}} degree of duodenal compression. Risk factors include anatomic characteristics such as: aesthenic (very thin or [...] "lanky") <b>body</b> <b>build,</b> an unusually high insertion of the duodenum at the ligament of Treitz, a particularly low origin of the SMA, or intestinal malrotation around an axis formed by the SMA. [...] Predisposition is easily aggravated by any of the following: poor motility of the digestive tract, retroperitional tumors, loss of appetite, malabsorption, cachexia, exaggerated lumbar lordosis, visceroptosis, abdominal wall laxity, peritoneal adhesions, abdominal trauma, rapid linear adolescent growth spurt, weight loss, starvation, catabolic states (as with cancer and burns), and history of neurological injury.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} an edited excerpt from a hitherto unknown fragmentary treatise by Rush Rhees. In the treatise, Rhees gives {{his account of}} the problem of continuity that he had started elaborating before he became acquainted with Wittgenstein. The excerpt, which contains Rhees' original distinction between outer and inner surfaces of <b>bodies,</b> <b>builds</b> on Brentano's theory of the continuum and his doctrine of plerosis. This treatment of continuity sheds light on Rhees' early philosophical development and confirms that even though he and Wittgenstein discussed the problem of continuity, Rhees' own approach remained distinct from that of Wittgenstein...|$|R
50|$|The {{program has}} a 10x10 split {{so that each}} day can have a {{specific}} muscle group target. The key to GVT is that the targeted muscle group is worked close to its breaking point. The <b>body</b> <b>builds</b> more muscle quickly by pushing these muscle groups to the limit using the 10x10 workout scheme. GVT is commonly used to build muscle mass quickly. GVT is very intense {{and should not be}} done consistently for more than 12 weeks because training the body in such a way for longer than this may cause muscle to lose strength and inhibit performance.|$|R

25|$|The <b>body</b> <b>builds</b> up a {{store of}} {{glycogen}} from converted carbohydrates in muscle cells. Glycogen, a fuel used by muscles for energy, is depleted during work and restocked when a horse rests. Oxygen-carrying blood metabolizes glycogen, but the blood can not flow {{fast enough to}} metabolise the excess stored glycogen. The glycogen that is not metabolized aerobically (by the oxygenated blood) must then be metabolized anaerobically, which then creates the cell waste products and heat, and ER has begun. A horse on a high-grain diet with little work collects more glycogen in its muscles than it can use efficiently when exercise begins, which is why horses on a high-grain diet {{are more likely to}} develop ER.|$|R
