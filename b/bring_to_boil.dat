Embryos are ready to be photographed. ### 3. Notes 1. Add agar into the water and <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> while mixing continuously. Wait for agar to go into solution. Add base before adding grape juice. Add remaining ingredients. Mix thoroughly. Use a beaker with handles to pour hot fly food onto the prepared trays. Let the food cool to room temperature before storing at 4 ° C. - For each step prepare enough reaction mix for 110 reactions per plate. - Hydrate G- 50 plate while running the PCR to save time. - Individual wells are very full and if the plate is not properly sealed contamination can occur. It is best to use 8 -strip PCR caps rather than aluminum plate sealers to prevent cross-contamination. - Resuspension buffer waste must be discarded into properly labeled Formamide waste container. - The nylon membranes must not overlay each other to ensure proper contact with the antibody solution. Therefore, if using more than one nylon membrane per tube, the length of individual membrane sheets should be no more that 11 cm. - Preparation of Controls. Spot 1 µl of each of 5 dilutions (1 : 3. 3, 1 : 10, 1 : 33, 1 : 100, and 1 : 330) of several different probes onto DIG Quantification Teststrips. Take the loaded DIG Quantification Teststrips and a DIG Control Teststrip through the quantification procedure. Evaluate which of the probe dilution series best approaches the control teststrip. Prepare an adequate amount of this probe dilution series and store at - 80 °C for future use. - Cover the Hybaid oven door with aluminum foil. Keep the developed nylon membranes in the dark even after stopping the color reaction, otherwise they will turn completely blue over time. - Developing solution must be discarded into a properly labeled NBT/BCIP waste container. - If the probe spot is at least as intense as the 1 : 330 control spot the RNA probe reaction was successful and the RNA probe is ready to be used in hybridization. - Flies lay better in the dark. Keep the fly cages in a room without windows or cover cages with a light-tight dark cloth. - For maximum egg deposition make sure the fly food trays and yeast paste are at room temperature before placing in the fly cage. - The paste has to be easily spreadable, so that the fly food will not separate from the tray, but not too watery so that the flies will not stick to the paste. - Hybridization assays are conducted usingstaged embryos from 0 to 18 hrs post fertilization. Due to uneven egg deposition during this period, embryos are collected in 3 hr intervals (0 - 3, 3 - 6, 6 - 9, 9 - 12, 12 - 15, 15 - 18) to ensure equal representation of all developmental stages in the master mix made by combining equal amounts of embryos from each 3 hr interval. - Example of Embryo Collection Schedule ![Table 4]([URL] "Table 4 ") Carefully remove any flies that may have stuck to the fly food or the yeast paste to prevent further egg deposition. While removing the flies take care not to damage the deposited embryos. 17. Pour enough deionized H 20 on the tray to cover the entire area. Use paintbrush to collect the embryos from the tray and carefully pour them into the prepared three level sieve. The first sieve (20) will collect pieces of loose agar, the second sieve(40) will collect loose fly parts (e. g. abdomens, wings and heads) and the third sieve will collect the clean embryos. 18. Must be large enough to contain one level of the sieve and high enough so that the embryos in the sieve are can be submerged in liquid. (e. g. 100 % bleach, deionized H 20). 19. Timing of this step is critical. If the embryos are left in bleach for too long they will be irreparably damaged. 20. Heptane must be discarded into a properly labeled heptane waste container. 21. Formaldehyde/PBS mixture must be prepared fresh just prior to use. Formaldehyde is a classified as a human carcinogen and should be handled with caution and discarded into a properly labeled Formaldehyde waste container. 22. When removing the upper (heptane) phase, start at the interphase and work your way up. Use Falcon Pipetaid. 23. Good embryos, unbroken embryos devoid of chorion and vitelline membranes, will sink to the bottom. Embryos remaining at interphase are damaged and should not be used in hybridization. 24. Methanol must be discarded into a properly labeled methanol waste container. 25. Do not put more than 7 ml of embryos in a 50 ml falcon tube. Lay the falcon tube on its side to prevent crushing the embryos. 26. The embryo master mix is created by combining equal volumes of embryos of all collected stages. It is best to measure out the individual stages in an eppendorf tube and then transfer individual time intervals into a prepared falcon tube. Let the embryos settle to ensure equal volumes. Easiest way to transfer the embryos is by turning the eppendorf tube upside down above the falcon tube and washing out the embryos with methanol using the pipetaid. 27. Waste from steps 3, 4 and 5 of the hybridization protocol (3. 2. 3) must be discarded into a properly labeled Formaldehyde waste container. 28. Use 12 ml total (9 ml methanol, 2. 88 ml PBS, 120 ul formaldehyde) -prepare fresh just before starting the hybridization steps. 29. Use 12 ml total (3 ml methanol, 8. 64 ml PBS, 360 ul formaldehyde) - prepare fresh just before starting the hybridization steps. 30. Use 12 ml total (11. 52 ml PBS, 480 ul formaldehyde) - prepare fresh just before starting the hybridization steps. 31.

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} {{as to the}} proper technique of hard-boiling an egg. One method is <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> water <b>to</b> a <b>boil</b> and cook for ten minutes. [...] Another method is <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the water <b>to</b> a <b>boil,</b> but then remove the pan {{from the heat and}} allow eggs to cook in the gradually cooling water. Over-cooking eggs will typically result in a thin green iron(II) sulfide coating on the yolk. This reaction occurs more rapidly in older eggs as the whites are more alkaline.Immersing the egg in cold water after boiling is a common method of halting the cooking process to prevent this effect. It also causes a slight shrinking of the contents of the egg.|$|R

[...] The UNDP in Malawi compared the CleanCook with wood and charcoal stoves and found that the CleanCook cut wood stoves’ CO emission in half, particulate emission by 99%, and energy use by 71%. The findings in comparison with charcoal showed similar results, with the energy use decreased by 55% and the emission and particulate reduction even greater than for wood stoves.|$|R
50|$|Simmering is a food {{preparation}} technique in which foods are cooked in hot liquids kept {{just below the}} boiling point of water (which is 100 °C or 212 °F at average sea level air pressure), but higher than poaching temperature.

50|$|The acting {{principle}} {{behind the}} vapor degreaser process {{is that the}} solvents will dissolve the contaminants on the workpiece and remove them by dripping off the part. A basin of solvent is set up with a heating coil <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the solvent <b>to</b> <b>boil.</b> As the solvent evaporates it rises to the fill-line in the chamber, above which is air with a much lower density than the solvent. This contains the vaporized solvent in a closed space where the workpiece is placed. The solvent condenses on the more frigid workpiece and the now liquid solvent dissolves the greases on the part. With the impurities contained in the liquid beads, the solvent runs off the part. Some systems are designed to capture and reclaim this solvent, making the process much more economical.|$|R

25|$|Variations on {{the flavor}} are gained by adding root {{vegetables}} such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root, herbs such as parsley, dill, other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves or tomatoes and black pepper. The soup {{should be brought}} slowly <b>to</b> a <b>boil</b> and then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. A clearer broth is achieved by skimming the drops of fat {{off the top of}} the soup as it is cooking, first <b>bringing</b> the chicken <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a strainer or cheesecloth. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then, the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored in the refrigerator until ready for use in the soup.|$|R
5000|$|Hot water crust pastry: Hot water crust pastry is {{used for}} [...] pies, such as pork pies, game pies and, more rarely, steak and kidney pies. Hot water crust is {{traditionally}} used for making hand-raised pies. The usual ingredients are hot water, lard and flour, the pastry is made by heating water, melting the fat in this, <b>bringing</b> <b>to</b> the <b>boil,</b> and finally mixing with the flour.

Either way, the result is a hot and rather sticky paste {{that can be used for}} hand-raising: shaping by hand, sometimes using a dish or bowl as an inner mould. As the crust cools, its shape is largely retained, and it is filled and covered with a crust, ready for baking. Hand-raised hot water crust pastry does not produce a neat and uniform finish, as there will be sagging during the cooking of the filled pie, which is generally accepted as the mark of a hand-made pie.|$|R
