500|$|This {{question}} (regarding {{the script}} development) {{was put to}} Ridley Scott by Total Film magazine: [...] "There were lots of rewrites on Hannibal—what was the main problem with the original material?" [...] Scott replied: [...] "That's inaccurate, because {{there were very few}} rewrites once I brought in Steve Zaillian. If you were to ask who were the best three screenwriters in the business, Steve Zaillian would <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> We discussed Hannibal endlessly." [...] Asked if he had read Mamet's draft, he said: [...] "Yes. He is very fast, very efficient, but he was off doing a film. 'Hannibal' was green lit and his first draft only took about a month. But I was scared {{that he would not be}} able to give me enough attention, because that draft needed a lot of work. So I moved on basically." [...] Scott has said there were writing and [...] "structural problems" [...] as to what they would do with parts of the film. One of Zaillian's key objectives was to revise the script by David Mamet until it pleased all parties, meaning the [...] "love" [...] story would need to be done by suggestion instead of by [...] "assault". Scott worked through the script with Zaillian for 28 days making him [...] "sweat through it with him and discuss every inch of the way with him." [...] After 25 days Scott suddenly realized that Zaillian was [...] "exorcising the 600 pages of the book. He was distilling through discussion what he was gonna finally do...Frankly I could have just made it." ...|$|E

On writing to Meaker, she said, [...] "To this day I {{have no idea why}} she responded to me out of the thousands of letters she was getting at that time. Thank God she did. I was both thrilled and terrified." [...] Bannon visited Meaker and was introduced to Greenwich Village, which made a significant impression on Bannon: she called it [...] "Emerald City, Wonderland, and Brigadoon combined—a place where gay people could walk the crooked streets hand in hand." [...] Meaker set up a meeting with Gold Medal Books editor Dick Carroll, who read Bannon's initial 600-page manuscript. It was a story about the women in her sorority whom she admired, with a subplot consisting of two sorority sisters who {{had fallen in love with}} each other. Carroll told her to take it back and focus on the two characters who had an affair. Bannon claims she went back and told their story, delivered the draft to Carroll and saw it published without a single word changed. While raising two young children, Bannon lived in Philadelphia and took trips into New York City to visit Greenwich Village and stayed with friends. She said of the women she saw in Greenwich Village, [...] "I wanted to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> to speak to other women, if only in print. And so I made a beginning—and that beginning was the story that became Odd Girl Out." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{begins with}} Jackson in {{what seems to}} be a hotel, singing about his girlfriend. He is distressed because he found a silver card in with the name [...] "Alex" [...] on it. To him, it implies that [...] "Alex" [...] is another man who his girlfriend is with; thus, she is {{cheating}} on Jackson. However, as the story in the video unfolds, this is not true, because the girl takes on different identities (I.e. Eve, Diana, etc.) for her job as a high class call girl. [...] "Alex" [...] (which is also a girl's name), just happens to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> The video alternates scenes from where Jackson is singing about his pain, to where the girl is being changed into her different identities and taking care of her jobs (mostly meeting with other men and even some women and sleeping with them). Towards the end of the video, Jackson has packed up his bags to leave town, because of his distress. A helicopter comes to pick him up from his house. The girl comes to Jackson's house and she asks his assistant (who knows the situation and aided Jackson in his departure) to let her in. It is likely she quit the job for him and wants to stay. The assistant shakes his head, implying that he left. When she asks why, he drops a flutter of silver nameplates (including the one that said [...] "Alex") from a slot in the door. After that scene, Jackson is seen sleeping and smoke floats out the side of the screen. Having lost her love and without any alternative, the girl turns to her callgirl existence again. Her employer slaps her in the face and she is then seen being prepared for a new identity.|$|E

2500|$|Nearly all of Vysotsky's {{songs are}} in the first person, {{although}} he is almost never the narrator. When singing his criminal songs, he would adopt the accent and intonation of a Moscow thief, and when singing war songs, he would sing {{from the point of}} view of a soldier. In many of his philosophical songs, he adopted the role of inanimate objects. This created some confusion about Vysotsky's background, especially during the early years when information could not be passed around very easily. Using his acting talent, the poet played his role so well that until told otherwise, many of his fans believed that he was, indeed, a criminal or war veteran. Vysotsky's father said that [...] "War veterans thought the author of the songs to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> as if he had participated in the war together with them." [...] The same could be said about mountain climbers; on multiple occasions, Vysotsky was sent pictures of mountain climbers' graves with quotes from his lyrics etched on the tombstones.|$|E
2500|$|UFOs {{constitute}} a widespread international cultural {{phenomenon of the}} last 60 years. Gallup Polls rank UFOs {{near the top of}} lists for subjects of widespread recognition. In 1973, a survey found that 95 percent of the public reported having heard of UFOs, whereas only 92 percent had heard of U.S. President Gerald Ford in a 1977 poll taken just nine months after he left the White House. A 1996 Gallup Poll reported that 71 percent of the United States population believed that the U.S. government was covering up information regarding UFOs. A 2002 Roper Poll for the Sci-Fi Channel found similar results, but with more people believing that UFOs are extraterrestrial craft. In that latest poll, 56 percent thought UFOs were real craft and 48 percent that aliens had visited the Earth. Again, about 70 percent felt the government was not sharing everything it knew about UFOs or extraterrestrial life.

2500|$|What's Going On was {{generally}} well received by contemporary critics. In Rolling Stone, Vince Aletti praised Gaye's thematic approach towards {{social and political}} concerns, while discussing the surprise of Motown releasing such an album. In a joint review of What's Going On and Stevie Wonder's Where I'm Coming From, Aletti wrote, [...] "Ambitious, personal albums may be a glut on the market elsewhere, but at Motown they're something new... the album as a whole takes precedence, absorbing its own flaws. There are very few performers who could carry a project like this off. I've always admired Marvin Gaye, but I didn't expect that he would <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Guess I seriously underestimated him. It won't happen again." [...] Billboard described the record as [...] "a cross between Curtis Mayfield and that old Motown spell and outdoes anything Gaye's ever done". Time magazine hailed it as a [...] "vast, melodically deft symphonic pop suite". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau was less impressed. He deemed it both a [...] "groundbreaking personal statement" [...] and a Berry Gordy product, baited by three highly original singles but marred elsewhere by indistinct music and indulgent use of David Van De Pitte's strings, which Christgau called [...] "the lowest kind of movie-background dreck".|$|E

2500|$|At 15:04 {{my flight}} was {{attacked}} by three MiGs, two from the ‘10 o’clock’ and one from the ´6 o’clock´. Initially I didn’t see this last one because I had been concentrating on those approaching head-on. My WSO excitedly warned me about this rapidly approaching MiG, which was within firing range of my #3 and #4. I hesitated a while before interrupting my attack against the two MiGs in front, because I had seen the ‘Olds’ flight passing below us a few seconds before. I thought that the plane seen by my WSO could <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Despite that, I suddenly turned left and then right, and {{caught sight of the}} third MiG. I ordered to my numbers 3 and 4 to break right. [...] As they did so, the MiG broke left for some mysterious reason and for a split second we were side by side. [...] We were so close that, besides the red stars in his wings, I could clearly see the pilot’s face. [...] I began a horizontal barrel roll to get away from him and into an attack position, once in position, I launched a Sidewinder. [...] The missile missed because the evading MiG broke left at full throttle. [...] But when he did it, he put himself {{in the line of fire}} of my number 2, Captain Everett T. Raspberry. [...] I ordered him to follow the prey, because the two aircraft that I initially saw had been placed in my forward sector. [...] I was in an advantageous position, so I fired two AIM-9s against them in a quick sequence, and I turned to place myself as wingman of my #2, Captain Raspberry. [...] I kept on descending besides Captain Raspberry and I remember that I thought that he was still out of the optimal launching envelope. But he performed a barrel roll that placed him in a perfect position again and he launched an AIM-9 which hit against the tail section of the MiG-21. It was shaken violently and later fell in a slow, almost plane spin.|$|E
