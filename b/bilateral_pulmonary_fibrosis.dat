40|$|At least 31 {{cases of}} {{familial}} fibrocystic pulmonary dysplasia, within 10 families, {{have been described}} in the world literature. The mode of genetic transmission of this disease, however, has been uncertain until now. The author observed three unequivocal and five probable cases of familial fibrocystic pulmonary dysplasia among 56 members of one family. Diagnostic criteria included progressive dyspnea and cyanosis, digital clubbing, pulmonary hypertension, negative sweat tests, polycythemia, arterial hypoxia and hypocapnia, chest radiographs showing diffuse <b>bilateral</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> and diffuse fibrocystic pulmonary dysplasia at postmortem examination (two cases). Among the three unequivocal cases one father-to-son transmission was observed. Non-sex-linked dominant transmission of familial fibrocystic pulmonary dysplasia is thereby proved for the first time.

40|$|Multiple {{investigators}} have undertaken genetic studies in idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> populations {{in attempts to}} define genetic links to disease in hopes that this would improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and target pathways for therapy. Multiple genes have been evaluated using a candidate gene approach with limited success, with results suggesting a disease modifier effect rather than a disease causing effect. Using this approach, associations have been observed between idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> and specific polymorphisms in genes encoding interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist, tumor necrosis factor-ï¿½, and complement receptor 1. Recently {{investigators have}} used familial <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> cohorts to evaluate for genetic mutations associated with idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> Using one <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> kindred, a mutation in the gene encoding surfactant protein C was identified {{as the cause of}} <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> in this family.

40|$|ABSTRACT Ten {{patients}} with severe respiratory failure secondary to extensive pulmonary tuber-culosis and thoracoplasty {{have been treated}} with intermittent negative-pressure ventilation. All recovered and have been followed up for from six months to eight years. Two have died from unrelated causes and six have used some form of breathing aid at home. Negative-pressure ventilation, which is a non-invasive form of respiratory support, offers important benefits in selected cases. Thoracoplasty played {{an important part in}} the man-agement of pulmonary tuberculosis before the advent of effective chemotherapy. In 1947 Holmes Sellors reported a series of 633 patients operated on between 1935 and 19461 and the work potential of about two-thirds of the 588 who had been traced was regarded as normal. In a later series from the same centre, Gough et a 12 described the outcome in 231 patients followed after thoracoplasty for six to eight years. Again the results were good but four late postoperative deaths were attributed to cor pulmonale. Pulmonary fibrosis and thoracic cage deformity caused by tuberculosis and thoracoplasty were considered to have contributed to these deaths, although a history of chronic bronchitis with emphysema was noted in all four and tuberculosis was quiescent at death in only two. Since then, chest wall deformity combined with extensive and often <b>bilateral</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> has been recognised more widely as a cause of respiratory failure and cor pulmonale, often presenting many years after the thoracoplasty. We report here a series of 10 such patients, whose cardiorespiratory failure proved refractory to conventional treatment and who were managed by intermittent negative-pressure ventila-tion.

40|$|Idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> is a {{progressive}} and lethal form of {{interstitial lung disease}} that lacks effective therapies at present. Glycyrrhizic acid (GA), a natural compound extracted from a traditional Chinese herbal medicine Glycyrrhiza glabra, was recently reported to benefit lung injury and liver fibrosis in animal models, yet whether GA has a therapeutic effect on <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> is unknown. In this study, we investigated the potential therapeutic effect of GA on <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> in a rat model with bleomycin (BLM) -induced <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> The results indicated that GA treatment remarkably ameliorated BLM-induced <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> and attenuated BLM-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and activation of tansforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway in the lungs.

In contrast, the production of IFN-Î³ was reduced in lungs from CD 1 dâ/â mice. Moreover, the adoptive transfer of NKT cells into CD 1 dâ/â mice increased IFN-Î³ and reduced TGF-Î² 1 production, attenuating <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> An in vitro assay demonstrated that IFN-Î³ was involved in suppressing TGF-Î² 1 production in cells collected from bronchoalveolar lavage.

Surgical procedures consisted of 7 wedge resections of the lung, 5 segmentectomies, 43 lobectomies, and 1 bilobectomy. ResultsSurgery-related hospital mortality was higher in patients with idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> than in patients without (7. 1 % vs 1. 9 %; P =. 030). Four (7. 1 %) of these 56 patients had acute postoperative exacerbation of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> and died because of this complication. No factors such as pulmonary function, serologic data, operative data, and histopathologic data were considered predictive risk factors for the acute exacerbation. The postoperative 5 -year survival for pathologic stage I lung cancer was 61. 6 % for patients with idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> and 83. 0 % for patients without (P =. 019). The causes of late death were the recurrence of cancer or respiratory failure owing to idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> ConclusionsAlthough idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> causes high mortality after pulmonary resection for lung cancer and poor long-term survival, long-term survival is possible in patients with these two fatal diseases. Therefore, in selected patients, idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> may not be a contraindication to pulmonary resection for stage I lung cancer...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN: Cough is {{a common}} symptom in {{idiopathic}} <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> {{that is difficult to}} treat and has a major impact on quality of life. We tested the hypothesis that the cough and increased cough reflex sensitivity seen in patients with idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> may be due to airway inflammation in a prospective, cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We measured the induced sputum inflammatory cell profile and cell-free supernatant inflammatory mediator concentrations in 15 patients with idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> 17 healthy controls and 15 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. RESULTS: Both the geometric mean sputum differential eosinophil cell count and median eosinophilic-cationic-protein concentration were significantly higher in patients with idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> than controls (2. 1 % vs 0. 3 %; p < 0. 001 and 1. 1 mg/ml versus 0. 2 mg/ml; p= 0. 03 respectively). There {{were no significant differences in}} sputum eosinophil counts and eosinophilic-cationic-protein concentrations between patients with idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Sputum leukotriene-B 4 concentrations were significantly lower in patients with idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> (p= 0. 03) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p= 0. 008) compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> is characterised by the presence of active eosinophilic airway inflammation raising the possibility that airway inflammation may contribute to symptoms such as cough...|$|R
