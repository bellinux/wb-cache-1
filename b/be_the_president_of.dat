25|$|Milan Bandić heavily used {{religion}} {{as an issue}} in the campaign, calculating that Josipović's agnosticism would be a turn-off for a largely Catholic country as Croatia. He constantly repeated the only one he fears is God and that he was raised as a true believer and a humble Christian, also making claims that he has the support of the Catholic Church. Josipović largely ignored Bandić's attempts saying he would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> all Croatians no matter their religious beliefs. The incumbent president Stjepan Mesić was elected twice despite his atheism. However, the Bandić campaign used all tactics to force the issue, even distributing fliers in front of churches after the Sunday mass across the country urging believers to choose between the cross and a red star, referencing communism.|$|E
25|$|Montoto {{went on to}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> Metropolitano, {{a railway}} consortium. During Montoto's tenure in this position, the General Audit Office and ARI both issued reports stating that the {{awarding}} of this concession to him had led to deterioration in the railway service. Montoto's partnership in this and other early ventures with Sergio Tasselli, a leading K-businessman, also raised questions at the time. In 2003, La Nación said that Tasselli, whose businesses, according to the newspaper, are always under “a pall of suspicion,” was “quietly building an economic empire” that was growing “in the shadows,” and that his “associates generally do {{not come from the}} world of business but from the world of politics, such as former Montoneros leader Mario Montoto.” Instead of improving the train service provided by Metropolitano, Montoto reportedly directed Alejandra Rafuls to film train operations and to edit the film {{in such a way as}} to make it look as if customers were themselves responsible for the service problems.|$|E
25|$|The {{most direct}} attack by Bandić on Josipović {{came at the}} very end of the first debate when he accused him of {{damaging}} the city of Zagreb in 1998 by allegedly abusing his position as the head of the oversight board of a savings bank Zlatica to make a series of financial maneuvers that enabled him to collect his deposit of 138,000 Deutsche Marks from the bank Komercijalna banka that had been blocked and later went bankrupt. Bandić cited a court ruling from 2006 that had invalidated those maneuvers. Josipović defended himself saying that was merely a civil case which he was not even a part of and that he did not commit any illegal actions. Josipović also had to defend his damaging quotation that Croatia would be coloured red by the next election, saying that it was only natural for a political party to be ambitious saying he does not consider the remarks to be unfitting repeating once again that, if elected, he would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> all citizens.|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{took to the}} Senate floor {{after the}} election, giving a speech well {{received}} in the North, [...] "I will not give up this government...

[...] As Southern senators announced they would resign if their states seceded, he reminded Mississippi Senator Jefferson Davis that if Southerners would only hold to their seats, the Democrats would control the Senate, and could defend the South's interests against any infringement by Lincoln. Gordon-Reed points out that while Johnson's belief in an indissoluble Union was sincere, he had alienated Southern leaders, including Davis, who would soon <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> the Confederate States of America, formed by the seceding states.
