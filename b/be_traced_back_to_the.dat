5|$|The {{concept of}} {{broaching}} can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early 1850s, {{with the first}} applications used for cutting keyways in pulleys and gears. After World War I, broaching was used to rifle gun barrels. In the 1920s and 30s the tolerances were tightened and the cost reduced thanks to advances in form grinding and broaching machines.|$|E

The population is covered by a basic health insurance plan provided by statute and optional insurance. In 2012, annual healthcare related expenditures reached 21.0billion kuna (€2.8billion). Healthcare expenditures comprise only 0.6% of private health insurance and public spending. In 2010, Croatia spent 6.9% of its GDP on healthcare.|$|E

In 1745 Branicki established Poland's first military college, the School of Civil and Military Engineering, in the city.|$|E

5|$|Though {{theories}} {{of quantum mechanics}} continue to evolve to this day, there is a basic framework for the mathematical formalism of problems in quantum mechanics which underlies the majority of approaches and can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mathematical formalisms and techniques first used by von Neumann. In other words, discussions about interpretation of the theory, and extensions to it, are now mostly conducted {{on the basis of}} shared assumptions about the mathematical foundations.|$|E
5|$|Dubstep is a {{genre of}} {{electronic}} dance music that originated in South London, England. It {{emerged in the}} late 1990s as a development within a lineage of related styles such as 2-step garage, dub, techno, drum and bass, broken beat, jungle, and reggae. In the United Kingdom {{the origins of the}} genre can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> growth of the Jamaican sound system party scene in the early 1980s. The music generally features sparse, syncopated drum and percussion patterns with bass lines that contain prominent sub bass frequencies.|$|E

5|$|Gangsta rap {{is a kind}} of hip hop, most {{importantly}} characterized by a lyrical focus on macho sexuality, physicality and a dangerous, criminal image. Though the origins of gangsta rap can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mid-1980s raps of Philadelphia's Schoolly D and the West Coast's Ice-T, the style is usually said to have begun in the Los Angeles and Oakland area, where Too Short, NWA and others found their fame. This West Coast rap scene spawned the early 1990s G-funk sound, which paired gangsta rap lyrics with a thick and hazy tone, often relying on samples from 1970s P-funk; the best-known proponents of this sound were the breakthrough rappers Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg.|$|E
5|$|German {{literature}} can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages and {{the works}} of writers such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach. Well-known German authors include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Theodor Fontane. The collections of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm popularised German folklore on an international level. The Grimms also gathered and codified regional variants of the German language, grounding their work in historical principles; their Deutsches Wörterbuch, or German Dictionary, sometimes called the Grimm dictionary, was begun in 1838 and the first volumes published in 1854.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activity}} in the lands of modern Bulgaria can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Paleolithic. Animal bones incised with man-made markings from Kozarnika cave {{are assumed to be}} the earliest examples of symbolic behaviour in humans. Organised prehistoric societies in Bulgarian lands include the Neolithic Hamangia culture, Vinča culture and the eneolithic Varna culture (fifth millennium BC). The latter is credited with inventing gold working and exploitation. Some of these first gold smelters produced the coins, weapons and jewellery of the Varna Necropolis treasure, the oldest in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years. This site also offers insights for understanding the social hierarchy of the earliest European societies.|$|E

In 1656 the thyroid received its name, by the anatomist Thomas Wharton. The gland was named thyroid, meaning shield, as its shape resembled the shields commonly used in Ancient Greece. The English name thyroid gland {{is derived from the}} medical Latin used by Wharton – glandula thyreoidea. Glandula means gland in Latin, and thyreoidea can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ancient Greek word θυρεοειδής, meaning shield-like/shield-shaped.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the rulers of Copán before the {{founding}} of a new dynasty with its origins at Tikal in the early 5thcentury AD, although the city's origins can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Preclassic period. After this, Copán {{became one of the}} more powerful Maya city states and was a regional power in the southern Maya region, although it suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of its former vassal state Quirigua in 738, when the long-ruling king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was captured and beheaded by Quirigua's ruler K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat (Cauac Sky). Although this was a major setback, Copán's rulers began to build monumental structures again within a few decades.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{innovations}} attributed to Andriamanelo were not his personal invention. Rather, their origins can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southeastern {{part of the}} island that the Hova had left behind as they migrated into the central highlands. Astrology, for instance, had been introduced early to the island by way of trade contacts between coastal Malagasy communities and Arab seafarers. Similarly, archaeological evidence proves the existence of iron implements in Madagascar at least four centuries prior to the war between Andriamanelo and the Vazimba, suggesting that while the technology was not discovered during his reign, Andriamanelo may have been among the first sovereigns in Imerina to make wide-scale use of it in military campaigns.|$|E
