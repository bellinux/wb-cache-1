5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail {{has a low}} <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>BMR),</b> {{measured}} in 1989 at around 60–68% the rate expected for a bird of its weight. The scientists responsible for the study speculated that the low BMR was not {{as a result of}} flightlessness, which does not have this effect in other bird species, but was instead the result of the rail's island lifestyle. The island lacks predators and other competitors, and as such can be expected to be at full carrying capacity for rails. This in turn would favour energy conservation by the rails, resulting in small body size, low BMR and flightlessness. A comparison of flighted and flightless rails, including the Inaccessible Island rail, found that rails that lose the ability to fly also have low BMRs.|$|E

25|$|As with birds, {{the main}} rule for mammals (with certain exceptions, see below) {{is that they}} have two {{essentially}} different stages of sleep: REM and NREM sleep (see above). Mammals' feeding habits are associated with their sleep length. The daily need for sleep is highest in carnivores, lower in omnivores and lowest in herbivores. Humans sleep less than many other omnivores but otherwise not unusually much or unusually little in comparison with other mammals. Many herbivores, like Ruminantia (such as cattle), spend much of their wake time in a state of drowsiness, which perhaps could partly explain their relatively low need for sleep. In herbivores, an inverse correlation is apparent between body mass and sleep length; big mammals sleep less than smaller ones. This correlation is thought to explain about 25% of the difference in sleep amount between different mammals. Also, the length of a particular sleep cycle is associated with the size of the animal; on average, bigger animals will have sleep cycles of longer durations than smaller animals. Sleep amount is also coupled to factors like basal metabolism, brain mass, and relative brain mass. The duration of sleep among species is also directly related to <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>BMR).</b> Rats, which have a high BMR, sleep for up to 14 hours a day, whereas elephants and giraffes, which have lower BMRs, sleep only 3–4 hours per day.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effect of}} AAS on muscle mass is caused {{in at least}} two ways: first, they {{increase}} the production of proteins; second, they reduce recovery time by blocking the effects of stress hormone cortisol on muscle tissue, so that catabolism of muscle is greatly reduced. It has been hypothesized that this reduction in muscle breakdown may occur through AAS inhibiting the action of other steroid hormones called glucocorticoids that promote the breakdown of muscles. AAS also affect the number of cells that develop into fat-storage cells, by favouring cellular differentiation into muscle cells instead. AAS can also decrease fat by increasing <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>BMR),</b> since an increase in muscle mass increases BMR.|$|E
2500|$|The {{metabolism}} of {{an animal}} is estimated by determining rates of carbon dioxide production (VCO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2) of individual animals, either in a closed or an open-circuit respirometry system. [...] Two measures are typically obtained: standard (SMR) or <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>BMR)</b> and maximal rate (VO2max). [...] SMR is measured while the animal is at rest (but not asleep) under specific laboratory (temperature, hydration) and subject-specific conditions (e.g., size or allometry), age, reproduction status, post-absorptive to avoid thermic effect of food). VO2max is typically determined during aerobic exercise at or near physiological limits. In contrast, field metabolic rate (FMR) refers to the metabolic rate of an unrestrained, active animal in nature. [...] Whole-animal metabolic rates refer to these measures without correction for body mass. [...] If SMR or BMR values are divided by the body mass value for the animal, then the rate is termed mass-specific.

40|$|In endotherms, {{metabolic}} {{performance is}} associated with a wide array of ecological traits, including species distribution. Researchers have suggested that the northern boundaries of North American passerines are limited by their ability to sustain the high <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> required for thermoregulation. Blackcapped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus; BC) are year-round residents in most of Canada and the northern half of the United States, whereas Carolina chickadees (Poecile carolinensis; CA) are found exclusively in the southeastern United States.

The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly {{has one of the}} lowest <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> among mammals.

Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss and conserve energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located {{at the base of the}} tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the dry season, their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.|$|R
40|$|Mountain chickadees and juniper titmice from {{northern}} Utah were examined to determine metabolic and body-composition characteristics associated with seasonal acclimatization. These species use behavioral adaptations and nocturnal hypothermia, which reduce energetic costs.

In addition, these species live at higher altitudes, which may also decrease metabolic acclimatization found in birds. Winter birds tolerated colder test temperatures than summer birds. This improved cold tolerance was associated with an increase in maximal ther-mogenic capacity or summit metabolism (Msum). Winter Msum exceeded summer Msum by 26. 1 % in chickadees and 16. 2 % in titmice. <b>Basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> (<b>BMR)</b> were also significantly higher in winter birds compared with summer birds.

Using a salamander model system in which ecological, genetic and physiological diversity are well characterized, we found strong quantitative relationships of <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> (<b>BMRs)</b> to both macroecological and phylogeographic patterns, with decreasing BMR leading to dispersal limitation (small contemporary ranges with marked phylogeographic structure).

Diet and all continuous-valued traits showed statistically significant phylogenetic signal, with the exception of masscorrected MMR and altitude. Therefore, results of phylogenetic analyses are emphasized. Body mass was not correlated with absolute latitude, but was positively correlated with precipitation in analyses with phylogenetically independent contrasts. Conventional multiple regressions that included body mass indicated that Tmax (best), Tmin, latitude, and diet were significant additional predictors of BMR. However, phylogenetic analyses indicated that latitude was the only significant predictor of mass-adjusted BMR (positive partial regression coefficient, one-tailed P � 0. 0465). Conventional analyses indicated that Tmax, Tmin (best), and altitude explained significant amounts of the variation in mass-adjusted MMR.

40|$|A {{vigorous}} discussion {{surrounds the}} question as to what enables some mammals—including primates and cetaceans—to evolve large brains. We recently published a study suggesting that the radiation of marsupial mammals is highly relevant to this question because of the unique reproductive and metabolic traits within this clade. In particular, we controversially suggested that marsupial brain sizes are not systematically smaller than those of placentals, and that elevated <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> (<b>BMR)</b> are not linked to larger marsupial brains. As our dataset was found to contain some erroneous body size data, derived from a published source, we here use an updated and corrected dataset and employ standard as well as phylogenetically corrected analyses to re-assess and elaborate on our original conclusions. Our proposal that marsupials are not systematically smaller-brained than placentals remains supported, particularly when the unusually large-brained placental clade, Primates, is excluded. Use of the new dataset not only confirms that high <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> are not associated with larger brain size in marsupials, but we additionally find some support for a striking negative correlation between BMR and brain size.

40|$|Life history theory {{suggests}} that species experiencing high extrinsic mortality rates allocate more resources toward reproduction relative to self-maintenance and reach maturity earlier (‘fast pace of life’) than those having greater life expectancy and reproducing at a lower rate (‘slow pace of life’). Among birds, many {{studies have shown that}} tropical species have a slower pace of life than temperate-breeding species. The pace of life has been hypothesized to affect metabolism and, as predicted, tropical birds have lower <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> (<b>BMR)</b> than temperate-breeding birds. However, many temperate-breeding Australian passerines belong to lineages that evolved in Australia and share ‘slow’ life-history traits that are typical of tropical birds. We obtained BMR from 30 of these ‘old-endemics’ and ten sympatric species of more recently arrived passerine lineages (derived from Afro-Asian origins or introduced by Europeans) with ‘faster’ life histories. The BMR of ‘slow’ temperate-breeding old-endemics was indistinguishable from that of new-arrivals and was not lower than the BMR of ‘fast’ temperate-breeding non-Australian passerines. Old-endemics had substantially smaller clutches and longer maximal life spans in the wild than new arrivals, but neither clutch size nor maximum life span was correlated with BMR.

After 5 weeks of exposure to the diets, we measured <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> (<b>BMR),</b> energy intake, glucuronic acid output and digestive and kidney structure. In both species, detoxification capacity expressed as glucuronic acid output was higher in individuals consuming phenol-enriched diets compared to the control diet. However, whereas sparrows increase energy intake and intestinal mass when feeding on phenol-enriched diets, finches had lower intestinal mass and energy intake remains stable. Furthermore, sparrows had higher BMR on phenolenriched diets compared to the control group, whereas in the finches BMR remains unchanged. Interspecific differences in response to phenols intake may be determined by the dietary habits of these species. While both species can feed on moderate phenolic diets for 5 weeks, energy costs may differ due to different responses in food intake and organ structure to counteract the effects of PSM intake...|$|R
