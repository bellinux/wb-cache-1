40|$|Thick <b>bonding</b> <b>wires</b> {{are used}} in modern power modules as {{connectors}} between integrated circuits, carrying current from one circuit to another. They experience high values of current, which generates heat through Joule heating {{and can lead to}} various failure mechanisms. Typically used wire materials in industry are aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), and intermetallic compounds of Cu-Al. They are broadly used because of their strength, high thermal conductivity, and low resistivity. This study reports on the influence of thermal loading on the mechanical behaviour of <b>bonding</b> <b>wires.</b> Experimental techniques are developed and introduced in this thesis to analyze quasi-static and dynamic response of <b>bonding</b> <b>wires</b> 300 µm in diameter. First, an experimental technique is developed to measure the quasi-static displacement of <b>bonding</b> <b>wires</b> carrying DC currents. It is then deployed to measure the displacement, as well as peak temperature, of three types of <b>bonding</b> <b>wires,</b> Al, Cu and Aluminum coated Copper (CuCorAl) to study the response under DC current. Secondly, an experimental technique is established and deployed for modal analysis of <b>bonding</b> <b>wires</b> under thermal loading. Experimental results demonstrate a drop in the natural frequency of <b>bonding</b> <b>wires</b> with increased thermal loads. Moreover, a harmonic analysis technique using thermal excitation is developed and applied to analyze the mode shapes and frequency response of <b>bonding</b> <b>wires.</b> Furthermore, an analytical model and a finite element model are used to analyze static and dynamic responses of <b>bonding</b> <b>wires.</b> Numerical and experimental results are compared in this thesis...|$|R

In this paper, the electrical {{performance of}} various <b>bonding</b> <b>wires</b> between chips and packages is presented. The impact of the length, spacing, height and diameter between the <b>bonding</b> <b>wires</b> was carefully examined. In order to investigate the impacts of <b>bonding</b> <b>wire</b> configuration parameters on signal transmission performance, a design of experiment (DOE) was set up. Based on data of DOE, two parameter equations were obtained to express the Radio Frequency characterization of <b>bonding</b> <b>wires.</b> From these equations, the optimized geometric structure parameters were obtained by optimization design.

50|$|Inside the package, {{the lower}} half has the leads embedded, and {{at the center of}} the package is a {{rectangular}} space, chamber, or void into which the IC die is cemented. The leads of the package extend diagonally inside the package from their positions of emergence along the periphery to points along a rectangular perimeter surrounding the die, tapering as they go to become fine contacts at the die. Ultra-fine bond wires (barely visible to the naked human eye) are welded between these die periphery contacts and bond pads on the die itself, connecting one lead to each bond pad, and making the final connection between the microcircuits and the external DIP leads. The bond wires are not usually taut but loop upward slightly to allow slack for thermal expansion and contraction of the materials; if a single <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> breaks or detaches, the entire IC may become useless. The top of the package covers all of this delicate assemblage without crushing the bond wires, protecting it from contamination by foreign materials.|$|E

50|$|The {{push for}} reduced cost, more compact circuit boards, and added {{customer}} features has providedincentives {{for the inclusion}} of analog functions on primarily digital MOS integrated circuits (ICs) formingmixed-signal ICs. In these systems, the speed of digital circuits is constantly increasing, chips arebecoming more densely packed, interconnect layers are added, and analog resolution is increased. In addition, recent increase in wireless applications and its growing market are introducing a new set of aggressive design goals for realizing mixed-signal systems. Here, the designer integrates radio frequency(RF) analog and base band digital circuitry on a single chip. The goal is to make single-chip radio frequencyintegrated circuits (RFICs) on silicon, where all the blocks are fabricated on the same chip. One of the advantages of this integration is low power dissipation for portability due to a {{reduction in the number of}} package pins and associated <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> capacitance. Another reason that an integrated solution offers lower power consumption is that routing high-frequency signals off-chip often requires a 50Ω impedance match, which can result in higher power dissipation. Other advantages include improved high-frequency performance due to reduced package interconnect parasitics, higher system reliability, smaller package count, and higher integration of RF components with VLSI-compatible digital circuits. In fact, the single-chip transceiver is now a reality.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{multitude}} of advantages <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antennas have over conventional planar antennas (especially onchip planar antennas), they have received much research attention within the last four years. The focus of the contributions made {{so far has been}} on exploiting different configurations of single-element and array <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antennas for short-range applications at RF/microwave frequencies. However, the effects of process tolerances of bond wires on the radiation characteristics of <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antennas have not been studied in published literature. Therefore in this paper, we investigate the impact of up to 20 % fluctuations in the parameters of bond wires on the performance of 42 GHz and 60 GHz <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antennas. Our results reveal that the length and radius of bond wires are the most and least sensitive parameters, respectively. Furthermore, the severity of the impact of process tolerances depends on the impedance bandwidth of the original antenna, before considering the tolerances. For example, a 10 % change in the length of a <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> causes the resonance frequency of a 42 GHz antenna to be shifted out of the specified 3 GHz bandwidth (40. 5 GHz- 43. 5 GHz) required for point-to-point communication. However, although a 10 % change in length of a <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> yields a 2. 5 GHz shift in the resonance frequency of a 60 GHz <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antenna, it doesn't completely detune the antenna because of the original 6 GHz bandwidth available, prior to the fluctuation. Therefore, to prevent the impact of process tolerances from severely degrading the performance <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antennas, these antennas should be designed to have larger bandwidths than specified. For experimental verification, a <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antenna was designed, fabricated and measured. Very good correlation was obtained between measurement and simulation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—During {{manufacture}} of wire bonding in packaged IC products, {{the breaking of}} bond wires and the peeling of bond pads occur frequently. The result is open-circuit failure in IC products. There were several prior methods reported {{to overcome these problems}} by using additional process flows or special materials. In this paper, a layout method is proposed to improve the <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> reliability in general CMOS processes. By changing the layout patterns of bond pads, the reliability of bond wires on bond pads can be improved. A set of different layout patterns of bond pads has been drawn and fabricated in a 0. 6 - m single-poly triple-metal CMOS process for investigation by the <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> reliability tests, the ball shear test and the wire pull test. By im-plementing effective layout patterns on bond pads in packaged IC products, not only the <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> reliability can be improved, but also the bond pad capacitance can be reduced for high frequency application.

40|$|In this contribution, {{the authors}} present a {{systematic}} approach for optimizing the RF performance of bond wires. First of all, a comparative analysis {{between two of}} the most commonly used <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> signal configurations, the two conductor and coplanar configurations, is done. Their results reveal that although the partial self-inductance of the signal wires is the same in both configurations, the partial mutual inductance of the coplanar configuration is higher, resulting in a smaller loop inductance. Consequently, the return and insertion losses are smaller. By reducing the distance between the signal and return currents, they further reduced the loop inductance, and significantly optimized the coplanar configuration. For example, considering a 1 mm long <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> with a diameter of 25 micron, they successfully kept the power lost through the coplanar configuration below 10 % at 15 GHz, in comparison to the 70 % power lost through the two-conductor configuration at the same frequency. However, more than 30 % of the entire power is lost through the optimized coplanar configuration at 40 GHz. At such frequencies where bond wires are unsuitable to be used as transmission lines, they demonstrate that they are very efficient as antennas by designing a half-loop integrated <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antenna having a bandwidth of 3 GHz.
