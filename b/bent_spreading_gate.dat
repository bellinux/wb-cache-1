The GEANT 4. 9. 2 release was used through the GATE platform. We focused on the Pencil Beam Scanning delivery technique, which allows for intensity modulated proton therapy applications. The most relevant options and parameters (range cut, step size, database binning) for the simulation that influence the dose deposition were investigated, in order to determine a robust, accurate and efficient simulation environment. In this perspective, simulations of depth-dose profiles and transverse profiles at different depths and energies between 100 and 230 MeV have been assessed against reference measurements in water and PMMA. These measurements were performed in Essen, Germany, with the IBA dedicated Pencil Beam Scanning system, using Bragg-peak chambers and radiochromic films. GEANT 4 simulations were also compared to the PHITS. 2. 14 and MCNPX. 2. 5. 0 Monte Carlo codes. Depth-dose simulations reached 0. 3 mm range accuracy compared to NIST CSDA ranges, with a dose agreement of about 1 % over a set of five different energies. The transverse profiles simulated using the different Monte Carlo codes showed discrepancies, with up to 15 % difference in beam widening between GEANT 4 and MCNPX in water. A 8 % difference between the GEANT 4 multiple scattering and single scattering algorithms was observed. The simulations showed the inability of reproducing the measured transverse dose spreading with depth in PMMA, corroborating the fact that GEANT 4 underestimates the lateral dose <b>spreading.</b> <b>GATE</b> was found to be a very convenient simulation environment to perform this study. A reference physics-list and an optimized parameters-list have been proposed. Satisfactory agreement against depth-dose profiles measurements was obtained. The simulation of transverse profiles using different Monte Carlo codes showed significant deviations. This point is crucial for Pencil Beam Scanning delivery simulations and suggests that the GEANT 4 multiple scattering algorithm should be revised. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Growing {{trends of}} fear and {{insecurity}} in cities have sparked the re-vis-itation of gating, posing significant problems for citizens and policy makers alike. Gated developments are a global phenomenon occurring in diverse countries in both the developed North and developing South. Metropolitan areas in South Af-rica have also witnessed a rapid {{increase in the number}} and <b>spread</b> of <b>gated</b> de-velopments since the late 1980 s. Development of enclosed neighbourhoods has become increasingly popular, gaining widespread support for their utopic lifestyle and safety features. On the whole, high levels of crime and fear of crime have led to the construction of defensible space, in the form of gated developments, result-ing in elevated levels of segregation. This paper provides a spatial analysis on gated developments in the non-metropolitan setting of Bloemfontein. The pattern and timeframe of gating in this city is shown to be similar to those found elsewhere in South Africa and, indeed, globally. Overall, it is the contention that gating is a trend not only seen in large metropolitan areas, but across the entire urban hi-erarchy of South Africa, and, as a consequence, requires investigation far beyon...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} out-of-equilibrium {{dynamics}} induced by quantum quenches in quadratic Hamiltonians featuring both short- and long-range interactions. The spreading of correlations {{in the presence}} of algebraic decaying interactions, 1 /R^α, is studied for lattice Bose models in arbitrary dimension D. These models are exactly solvable and provide useful insight in the universal description of more complex systems as well as comparisons to the known universal upper bounds for the spreading of correlations. Using analytical calculations of the dominant terms and full numerical integration of all quasi-particle contributions, we identify three distinct dynamical regimes. For strong decay of nteractions, α>D+ 1, we find a causal regime, qualitatively similar to what previously found for short-range interactions. This regime is characterized by ballistic (linear cone) spreading of the correlations with a cone velocity equal to twice the maximum group velocity of the quasi-particles. For weak decay of interactions, α<D, we find instantaneous activation of correlations at arbitrary distance. This signals the breaking of causality, which can be associated with the divergence of the quasi-particle energy spectrum. Finite-size scaling of the activation time precisely confirms this interpretation. For intermediate decay of interactions, D<α<D+ 1, we find a sub-ballistic, algebraic (<b>bent</b> cone) <b>spreading</b> and determine the corresponding exponent as a function of α. These outcomes generalize existing results for one-dimensional systems to arbitrary dimension.

Findings - There is a fast <b>spread</b> of <b>gated</b> communities in the Pearl River Delta and some private shopping centres provide public facilities and entertainment as a public relation method. Research limitations/implications - The transformation of negative externalities into positive ones is the crux to achieve win-win solutions to property management for sustainable development.

40|$|International audienceThe {{worldwide}} <b>spread</b> of <b>gated</b> residential developments (GRDs) reached Southern Africa in {{the late}} 1980 s, {{at a time of}} dramatic political and urban change. Their success has been primarily interpreted as an outcome of the transformations affecting cities, i. e. perceived decreased security and changing racial patterns. Such analyses are embedded in the fragmentation of urban societies and shed light on community or household strategies. Breaking away from this perspective, we argue that, although GRDs fit very well into unequal postcolonial, postwar or post-apartheid societies, they should also be envisioned as polymorphic real estate products tailored to care for the middle classes of the corresponding urban contexts. By focusing on the role of developers, estate agents and international aid networks in spreading this model in Cape Town, Maputo and Windhoek, we highlight the importance of market-related and political processes, as well as the influence of the local urban, political and town planning contexts on the adaptation of this private suburban housing product. The circulation of this model is geographically analysed in terms of scales and local contexts through a comparative approach that allows us to assess how it adapts to or disrupts inherited urban patterns and planning traditions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn potassium-free {{solutions}} {{some types}} of K channels enter a long-lasting nonconducting or “defunct” state. It is known that Shaker K channels must open in K+-free solutions to become defunct. Gating current studies presented here indicate an abnormal conformation in the defunct state that restricts S 4 movement and alters its kinetics. Thus an abnormality initiated in the P region <b>spreads</b> to the <b>gating</b> apparatus. We find that channels most readily become defunct on repolarization to an intermediate voltage, thus prolonging occupancy {{of one of the}} several intermediate closed states. The state dependence of becoming defunct was further dissected by using the gating mutant L 382 A. Simply closing this channel at 0 mV (reversing the last activation step) does not make the mutant channel defunct. Instead, it is necessary to move further left (more fully closed) in the activation sequence. This was confirmed with ShIR experiments showing that channels become defunct only if there is inward gating charge movement. Rapid transit through the intermediate states, achieved at very negative voltage, is relatively ineffective at making channels defunct. Several mutations that removed C-type inactivation also made the channels resistant to becoming defunct. Our results show that normal gating current cannot be stably recorded in the absence of K+...|$|R

40|$|Harnessing random micro-meso scale ambient energy (M 2 SAE), {{which is}} widely {{available}} in human motions, wind driven vibrations, water surface fluctuations, etc., is not only clean and sustainable, but it also enables self-powered sensors and devices to be realized. In my research, I have fabricated a case-encapsulated triboelectric generator (cTENG) based {{on the principles of}} sliding electrification for harvesting M 2 SAE from reciprocating motions. Patterned with multiple sets of grating electrodes and lubricated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) nanoparticles, cTENG generated an average effective output power of 12. 2 mW over a 140 kΩ external load and a power density of 1. 36 W/m 2 at a sliding speed of 1 m/s. The cTENG can also be triggered by direct-applied forces, as well as, inertia forces to effectively capture ambient energy from vibrations of large amplitudes and low frequencies such as those arising in human motions and water surface fluctuations. Based on the success of the patterned cTENG, I have built a self-powered velocity sensor for either rectified linear or rotary motion by sourcing the energy from the triboelectric generator. Employing alternating Kapton-copper strips arranged in a spiral configuration wrapped on the inner and outer surfaces of two concentric cylinders, voltage assays for linear and rotary motions can be measured without the need for an external power source. The triboelectric generated output signals when integrated with a digital circuit and a microcontroller unit can be directly processed into remarkably stable, macro-scale output signals for measurements of (0. 1 - 0. 6) ms- 1 +_ 0. 5 % for linear velocities and (300 - 700) rpm +_ 0. 9 % for rotary velocities. I have also fabricated a self-powered, thin-film motion direction sensor by harvesting the operational energy from a close-proximity triboelectrification of two surfaces in relative reciprocation. The mover made by coating a thin polytetrafluoroethylene film with a 2 -column, specially arranged array of copper electrodes and the stator is made by coating the top and bottom surfaces of a thin polyimide film with a 2 -column aligned array of copper electrodes placed in an alternating pattern. As the mover traverses over the stator, the electrodes in the mover actively generate electric signals of ± 5 V to attain a peak power density of ≥ 65 mW/m 2 at speeds of 0. 3 ms- 1. The prototype can be extend for 2 -D motion direction sensing. The highly pliable sensor can be easily <b>bent</b> to <b>spread</b> over curved and uneven surfaces. Finally, I have demonstrated a quasi-static angular positioning sensor based on 4 -channel encoded pattern on the electrification surface. The sensor consists of a rotator designed with 4 -channel coding Cu foil material and a stator including electrodes covered with FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene) ﬁlm. Due to coupling effect of triboelectriﬁcation and electrostatic induction, the sensor generates electric output signals in response to mechanical rotating motion of an object mounted with the sensor. The sensor can read and remember the absolute angular position regardless being continuously monitored or segmented monitored. Velocity and acceleration can be calculated as well. Under a rotation speed of 100 rad min- 1, the output voltage of the sensor reaches as high as 60 V. Angular resolution of 22. 5 ° is achieved and can be further improved by increasing the number of channels. Triggered by the output voltage signal, the rotating characteristics of the steering wheel can be real-time monitored and mapped by being mounted to the sensor. My work represents the first successful attempt in harvesting M 2 SAE using a patterned triboelectric generator and then, using the harvested ambient energy to drive a kinematic sensor that is integrated with a commercial digital circuit for a dual-mode speed and direction sensing. I believe my pioneering demonstration of the applied triboelectric technology will have a huge impact in the industrial commercialization of self-powered devices and sensors. Ph. D...|$|R
6000|$|Smooth {{life had}} flock and {{shepherd}} in old time, [...] Long springs and tepid winters, {{on the banks}} [...] Of delicate Galesus [P]; and no less [...] 175 [...] Those scattered along Adria's myrtle shores: [Q] [...] Smooth life had herdsman, and his snow-white herd [...] To triumphs and to sacrificial rites [...] Devoted, on the inviolable stream [...] Of rich Clitumnus [R]; and the goat-herd lived [...] 180 [...] As calmly, underneath the pleasant brows [...] Of cool Lucretilis [S], where the pipe was heard [...] Of Pan, Invisible God, thrilling the rocks [...] With tutelary music, from all harm [...] The fold protecting. I myself, mature [...] 185 [...] In manhood then, have seen a pastoral tract [...] Like one of these, where Fancy might run wild, [...] Though under skies less generous, less serene: [...] There, for her own delight had Nature framed [...] A pleasure-ground, diffused a fair expanse [...] 190 [...] Of level pasture, islanded with groves [...] And banked with woody risings; but the Plain [T] [...] Endless, here opening widely out, and there [...] Shut up in lesser lakes or beds of lawn [...] And intricate recesses, creek or bay [...] 195 [...] Sheltered within a shelter, where at large [...] The shepherd strays, a rolling hut his home. [...] Thither he comes with spring-time, there abides [...] All summer, and at sunrise ye may hear [...] His flageolet to liquid notes of love [...] 200 [...] Attuned, or sprightly fife resounding far. [...] Nook is there none, nor tract of that vast space [...] Where passage opens, but the same shall have [...] In turn its visitant, telling there his hours [...] In unlaborious pleasure, with no task [...] 205 [...] More toilsome than to carve a beechen bowl [...] For spring or fountain, which the traveller finds, [...] When through the region he pursues at will [...] His devious course. A glimpse of such sweet life [...] I saw when, from the melancholy walls [...] 210 [...] Of Goslar, once imperial, I renewed [...] My daily walk along that wide champaign, [U] [...] That, reaching to her <b>gates,</b> <b>spreads</b> east and west, [...] And northwards, from beneath the mountainous verge [...] Of the Hercynian forest, [V] Yet, hail to you [...] 215 [...] Moors, mountains, headlands, and ye hollow vales, [...] Ye long deep channels for the Atlantic's voice, [W] [...] Powers of my native region! Ye that seize [...] The heart with firmer grasp! Your snows and streams [...] Ungovernable, and your terrifying winds, [...] 220 [...] That howl so dismally for him who treads [...] Companionless your awful solitudes! [...] There, 'tis the shepherd's task the winter long [...] To wait upon the storms: of their approach [...] Sagacious, into sheltering coves he drives [...] 225 [...] His flock, and thither from the homestead bears [...] A toilsome burden up the craggy ways, [...] And deals it out, their regular nourishment [...] Strewn on the frozen snow. And when the spring [...] Looks out, and all the pastures dance with lambs, [...] 230 [...] And when the flock, with warmer weather, climbs [...] Higher and higher, him his office leads [...] To watch their goings, whatsoever track [...] The wanderers choose. For this he quits his home [...] At day-spring, and no sooner doth the sun [...] 235 [...] Begin to strike him with a fire-like heat, [...] Than he lies down upon some shining rock, [...] And breakfasts with his dog. When they have stolen, [...] As is their wont, a pittance from strict time, [...] For rest not needed or exchange of love, [...] 240 [...] Then from his couch he starts; and now his feet [...] Crush out a livelier fragrance from the flowers [...] Of lowly thyme, by Nature's skill enwrought [...] In the wild turf: the lingering dews of morn [...] Smoke round him, as from hill to hill he hies, [...] 245 [...] His staff protending like a hunter's spear, [...] Or by its aid leaping from crag to crag, [...] And o'er the brawling beds of unbridged streams. [...] Philosophy, methinks, at Fancy's call, [...] Might deign to follow him through what he does [...] 250 [...] Or sees in his day's march; himself he feels, [...] In those vast regions where his service lies, [...] A freeman, wedded to his life of hope [...] And hazard, and hard labour interchanged [...] With that majestic indolence so dear [...] 255 [...] To native man. A rambling school-boy, thus [...] I felt his presence in his own domain, [...] As of a lord and master, or a power, [...] Or genius, under Nature, under God, [...] Presiding; and severest solitude [...] 260 [...] Had more commanding looks when he was there. [...] When up the lonely brooks on rainy days [...] Angling I went, or trod the trackless hills [...] By mists bewildered, [X] suddenly mine eyes [...] Have glanced upon him distant a few steps, [...] 265 [...] In size a giant, stalking through thick fog, [...] His sheep like Greenland bears; or, as he stepped [...] Beyond the boundary line of some hill-shadow, [...] His form hath flashed upon me, glorified [...] By the deep radiance of the setting sun: [...] 270 [...] Or him have I descried in distant sky, [...] A solitary object and sublime, [...] Above all height! like an aerial cross [...] Stationed alone upon a spiry rock [...] Of the Chartreuse, for worship. [Y] Thus was man [...] 275 [...] Ennobled outwardly before my sight, [...] And thus my heart was early introduced [...] To an unconscious love and reverence [...] Of human nature; hence the human form [...] To me became an index of delight, [...] 280 [...] Of grace and honour, power and worthiness. [...] Meanwhile this creature--spiritual almost [...] As those of books, but more exalted far; [...] Far more of an imaginative form [...] Than the gay Corin of the groves, [Z] who lives [...] 285 [...] For his own fancies, or to dance by the hour, [...] In coronal, with Phyllis in the midst--[Z] [...] Was, {{for the purposes of}} kind, a man [...] With the most common; husband, father; learned, [...] Could teach, admonish; suffered with the rest [...] 290 [...] From vice and folly, wretchedness and fear; [...] Of this I little saw, cared less for it, [...] But something must have felt. [...] Call ye these appearances [...] Which I beheld of shepherds in my youth, [...] This sanctity of Nature given to man, [...] 295 [...] A shadow, a delusion? ye who pore [...] On the dead letter, miss the spirit of things; [...] Whose truth is not a motion or a shape [...] Instinct with vital functions, but a block [...] Or waxen image which yourselves have made, [...] 300 [...] And ye adore! But blessed be the God [...] Of Nature and of Man that this was so; [...] That men before my inexperienced eyes [...] Did first present themselves thus purified, [...] Removed, and to a distance that was fit: [...] 305 [...] And so we all of us in some degree [...] Are led to knowledge, wheresoever led, [...] And howsoever; were it otherwise, [...] And we found evil fast as we find good [...] In our first years, or think that it is found, [...] 310 [...] How could the innocent heart bear up and live! [...] But doubly fortunate my lot; not here [...] Alone, that something of a better life [...] Perhaps was round me than it is the privilege [...] Of most to move in, but that first I looked [...] 315 [...] At Man through objects that were great or fair; [...] First communed with him by their help. And thus [...] Was founded a sure safeguard and defence [...] Against the weight of meanness, selfish cares, [...] Coarse manners, vulgar passions, that beat in [...] 320 [...] On all sides from the ordinary world [...] In which we traffic. Starting from this point [...] I had my face turned toward the truth, began [...] With an advantage furnished by that kind [...] Of prepossession, without which the soul [...] 325 [...] Receives no knowledge that can bring forth good, [...] No genuine insight ever comes to her. [...] From the restraint of over-watchful eyes [...] Preserved, I moved about, year after year, [...] Happy, [a] and now most thankful that my walk [...] 330 [...] Was guarded from too early intercourse [...] With the deformities of crowded life, [...] And those ensuing laughters and contempts, [...] Self-pleasing, which, if we would wish to think [...] With a due reverence on earth's rightful lord, [...] 335 [...] Here placed to be the inheritor of heaven, [...] Will not permit us; but pursue the mind, [...] That to devotion willingly would rise, [...] Into the temple and the temple's heart.|$|R
