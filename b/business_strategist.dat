2500|$|In 2005, {{a team of}} {{marketing}} researchers, Barak Libai, Eitan Muller and Renana Peres, found that, contrary to managerial intuition and common assumptions in marketing research, strategies that disperse marketing efforts are generally better strategies. These include 'support the weak', in which the firm focuses its marketing efforts on the remaining market potential, and 'uniform', in which the firm distributes the marketing efforts evenly among its regions. [...] This conclusion is congruent {{with the work of}} Japanese <b>business</b> <b>strategist</b> Kenichi Ohmae, which suggests that the sprinkler business model is superior and recommended to companies wishing to start a seeding program.|$|E

[...] He also stated JD was next on his list to call regarding a major recording contract he was negotiating for the band. In an interview with Confidential on 1 March 2009, Murphy stated [...] "The whole thing has been bizarre – he was basically a contractor and his contract had ended." [...] Speaking with Billboard, Murphy stated that he would rather part ways with the band than work with Fortune. [...] "If the band said to me tomorrow, 'We'd still like you to make that call and talk to him about working on a project,' I'd have to say 'Sorry, I have to go.'" [...] However, JD Fortune toured with INXS as frontman in February 2011.|$|E

40|$|Economic {{activity}} {{requires the}} coordination {{of a variety of}} functions within and between firms. The organization of economic activity and the mechanisms used to coordinate such activity have become increasingly central issues for industrial economists and <b>business</b> <b>strategists.</b> While economists explore the advantages of markets versus hierarchies, <b>business</b> <b>strategists</b> are turning their attention to the notion of the boundaryless firm, and historians are studying the evolution of coordination mechanisms in particular companies and industries (see Williamson 1985; Hirshhorn and Gilmore 1992; papers in this volume). In this regard, geographically concentrated industries, industries in which many or most of the competitors are located in close proximity, provide unique opportunities to examine the organization of economic activity and the nature of coordination both within and among firms. The main reason is that geo-graphic concentration increases the effectiveness of the external coordination mechanisms available to firms, and therefore allows for a wider variety of orga-nizational forms and coordination mechanisms than might otherwise be ob...|$|R
