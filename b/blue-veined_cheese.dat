50|$|Similarly {{to other}} {{varieties}} of cheese, {{the process of}} making blue cheese consists of six standard steps, as well as further additions that give this <b>blue-veined</b> <b>cheese</b> its unique properties. The first step is acidification where a starter culture is added to milk in order to change lactose to lactic acid, thus changing the acidity of the milk and turning it from liquid to solid. The next step is coagulation, where rennet, a mixture of rennin and other material found in the stomach lining of a calf is added to solidify the milk further. Following this, thick curds are cut typically with a knife to encourage the release of liquid or whey. The smaller the curds are cut, the thicker and harder the resulting cheese will become. Salt is then added to provide flavor as well as to act as a preservative so the cheese does not spoil. Next, the cheese is given its form and further pressed with weights if necessary to expel any excess liquid. The final step is ripening the cheese by aging it. The temperature and the level of humidity in the room where the cheese is aging is monitored to ensure the cheese does not spoil or lose its optimal flavor and texture.|$|E

Although mould and yeast populations grew more quickly in the inoculated cheeses, their normally dominant and representative microbial populations were not affected neither was their gross biochemical composition changed. The variations observed were thought to be caused by the uncontrolled environmental conditions of manufacture and ripening. The development of free amino acids and volatile compounds was significantly increased at 30 days in the inoculated cheeses, although the values for both types of cheese were almost identical at 90 days.

Nine selective and/or differential media were used to track the cultivable populations of total and indicator microbial groups. For PCR-DGGE, the V 3 hyper variable region of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene and the eukaryotic D 1 domain of 28 S rDNA were amplified with universal primers, specific for prokaryotes and eukaryotes, respectively. Similarities and differences between the results obtained by the culturing and the molecular method were recorded for some populations. Culturing analysis allows minority microbial groups (coliforms, staphylococci) to be monitored, although in this study PCR-DGGE identified a population of Streptococcus thermophilus that went undetected by culturing.

This method was found to be specific and to show a wide dynamic range, thus allowing the quantification of these tdc+ bacterial groups among the complex microbiota of cheese. tdc qPCR was used to follow the development of tdc+ microbiota during the manufacture of a <b>blue-veined</b> <b>cheese</b> (Cabrales) made from raw milk. In this type of cheese, tdc+ enterococci seem to be responsible for the high concentrations of tyramine detected.

Metagenomic analysis of these communities by high throughput shotgun sequencing is a promising approach to characterize their genomic and functional profiles. Such analyses, however, critically depend {{on the availability of}} appropriate reference genome databases against which the sequencing reads can be aligned. Results: We built a reference genome catalog suitable for short read metagenomic analysis using a low-cost sequencing strategy. We selected 142 bacteria isolated from dairy products belonging to 137 different species and 67 genera, and succeeded to reconstruct the draft genome of 117 of them at a standard or high quality level, including isolates from the genera Kluyvera, Luteococcus and Marinilactibacillus, still missing from public database. To demonstrate the potential of this catalog, we analysed the microbial composition of the surface of two smear cheeses and one <b>blue-veined</b> <b>cheese,</b> and showed that {{a significant part of the}} microbiota of these traditional cheeses was composed of microorganisms newly sequenced in our study. Conclusions: Our study provides data, which combined with publicly available genome references, represents the most expansive catalog to date of cheese-associated bacteria.

A small-scale cheese model was developed to allow examination {{of the effect of}} different microflora on flavour production in a controlled way. Texture analysis, water activity and viable count of the cheese models were compared to commercial cheeses in order to optimise the model. The final model had the hardness of Danish Blue and the water activity of Stilton. The growth of lactic acid bacteria through the cheese making process was monitored and showed a characteristic reduction after salting. Changes in total aerobic count and yeast and moulds after salt addition and handling showed the ease with which the cheese can become contaminated with external flora such as yeasts and moulds even under aseptically manipulated conditions. Solid Phase Microextraction Gas Chromatography Mass-Spectrometry was used to evaluate the flavour volatiles produced when milk and cheese were inoculated with different microorganisms. Some yeast species such as Trichosporon beigleii inhibited the metabolism of P. roqueforti within the models, where as others such as Debaryomyces hansenii aided the metabolism of compounds in the models to develop different flavour volatiles.

40|$|Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a toxic {{metabolite}} {{produced by}} many Penicillium species among which are P. brevicompactum and P. roqueforti. Byssochlamys nivea, a yeast species, {{has also been}} reported to produce MPA. MPA producing fungi are frequently isolated from maize and grass silage (animal feed) for example P. roqueforti. Byssochlamys species are also responsible for spoilage and degradation of fruits and silages. P. brevicompactum has been isolated {{from a wide range}} of human foods. P. roqueforti is used in the production of blue-veined cheeses, thus MPA has been detected in most of this type of cheese. Animals are exposed to MPA through the ingestion of contaminated feeds. MPA or majority of MPA producing fungi have been found in animal feed thus could be carried over to human foods of animal origin. MPA has not been detected in milk so far, but up to 0. 23 mg/kg has been found in sheep muscle tissue. The possibility for MPA occurrence in fruit is high but this has not been extensively studied yet. The major route of for human exposure is therefore dietary. From the available data, exposure of humans and animals to MPA seems to be considerably high (> 0. 1 mg/day for humans, 900 mg/day for cattle and 1. 8 mg/kg body weight for livestock in general). This could have health consequences especially considering that humans and animals are chronically exposed to this compound. The calculated Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for humans is 0. 195 mg and that for cattle is 1. 8 mg. Due to the genotoxic nature of MPA (although results of genotoxicity assays are conflicting), the Margin of Exposure (MOE) of MPA for humans has been calculated which is 1000; thus it is a substance with a high risk for which urgent risk management measures are required. The few clinical studies on animal subjects have also been strictly limited to the acute, rather than chronic, toxin exposure. Chronic exposure studies however will be more relevant to real life situation. Human exposure to MPA has not been extensively studied, thus there are only a few data on its concentration in human food products. The consumption of <b>blue-veined</b> <b>cheese</b> is a major route of human exposure. However, the cumulative exposure from different food sources which should be of health concern has not been studied.

However, an ability to induce recombination is of great economic and fundamental importance, as it would make it possible to transform and improve industrial strains, promoting the creation of novel phenotypes and eliminating the deleterious mutations that accumulate during clonal propagation. We report here, for the first time, the induction of the sexual structures of P. roqueforti — ascogonia, cleistothecia and ascospores. The progeny of the sexual cycle displayed clear evidence of recombi-nation. We also used the recently published genome sequence for this species to develop microsatellite markers for investigating the footprints of recombination and population structure in a large collection of isolates from around the world and from different environments. Indeed, P. roqueforti also occurs in silage, wood and human-related environments other than cheese. We found tremendous genetic diversity within P. roqueforti, even within cheese strains and identified six highly differentiated clusters that probably predate the use of this species for cheese production.

The present work reports a functional metagenomic analysis of the prevalence and evolution of tetracycline resistance determinants in a raw-milk, <b>blue-veined</b> <b>cheese</b> during manufacturing and ripening. For this, the same cheese batch was sampled and analyzed on days 3 and 60 of manufacture. Samples were diluted and grown in the presence of tetracycline on plate count milk agar (PCMA) (non-selective) and de Man Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) agar (selective for lactic acid bacteria, LAB). DNA from the cultured bacteria was then isolated and used to construct four fosmid libraries, named after the medium and sampling time: PCMA- 3 D, PCMA- 60 D, MRS- 3 D, and MRS- 60 D. Clones in the libraries were subjected to restriction enzyme analysis, PCR amplification, and sequencing. Among the 300 fosmid clones analyzed, 268 different EcoRI restriction profiles were encountered. Sequence homology of their extremes clustered the clones into 47 groups. Representative clones of all groups were then screened for the presence of tetracycline resistance genes by PCR, targeting well-recognized genes coding for ribosomal protection proteins and efflux pumps. A single tetracycline resistance gene was detected in each of the clones, with four such resistance genes identified in total: tet(A), tet(L), tet(M), and tet(S). tet(A) was the only gene identified in the PCMA- 3 D library, and tet(L) the only one identified in the PCMA- 60 D and MRS- 60 D libraries. tet(M) and tet(S) were both detected in the MRS- 3 D library and in similar numbers. Six representative clones of the libraries were sequenced and analyzed. Long segments of all clones but one showed extensive homology to plasmids from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. tet(A) was found within a sequence showing strong similarity to plasmids pMAK 2 and pO 26 -Vir from Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli, respectively. All other genes were embedded in, or near to, sequences homologous to those of LAB species. These findings strongly suggest an evolution of tetracycline resistance gene types during cheese ripening, which might reflect the succession of the microbial populations. The location of the tetracycline resistance genes in plasmids, surrounded or directly flanked by open reading frames encoding transposases, invertases or mobilization proteins, suggests they might have a strong capacity for transference. Raw-milk cheeses should therefore be considered reservoirs of tetracycline resistance genes that might be horizontally transferred...|$|E
40|$|Blue Stilton is a <b>blue-veined</b> <b>cheese</b> {{manufactured}} in a restricted {{area of the}} UK, using lactic starter cultures plus a secondary culture of Penicillium roquefotti. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the change in microflora during ripening of the cheese and to investigate potential microbial interactions. Additionally, the volatile compounds present in mature samples of cheeses exhibiting few blue veins were compared with those in good quality cheeses, showing ample blue veining. Experiments on cheeses from a single dairy, monitored during the ripening process, showed that the total Lactobacillus count increased from levels of around 103 cfu g- 1 on day one to around 107 cfu g- 1 after 8 weeks of ripening. This is comparable to values found in other cheeses including both mould-ripened and non mould-ripened varieties. Yeast counts were generally higher than those found in other cheeses and also increased to levels in the region of 107 g- 1. The total viable count (TVC) decreased from around 109 g- 1 initially, reflecting the presence of the starter bacteria, to 107 g. 1, suggesting a decline in the starter bacteria similar to that found in other cheeses. Mature cheeses always exhibited similar numbers of microorganisms although the species varied between cheeses. High quality, mature, cheeses were compared with sub-standard cheeses from the same production site. The predominant species of lactobacilli in good quality cheeses were Lb. plantarum and Lb. curvatus, whereas in poor quality cheeses Lb. brevis predominated. This corresponded to the results of gas chromatography-olfactometry, which indicated the presence of fruity off flavours in poor quality cheeses. Several strains of these species were isolated, as indicated by differing capabilities in utilisation of a range of carbon sources. Yeast species also varied between good and poor quality cheeses with Candida sphaerlca and C. catenulata predominating in good cheeses and C. famata, C. lipolytica and C. catenulata also occurring in both good and poor quality samples. Strain differences were observed by the biochemical profiles and two strains of C. famata demonstrated inhibitory effects against P. roqueforti when incubated under anaerobiosis. It was concluded that these strains may affect the development of blue veins in Stilton cheese when maturation conditions encourage their proliferation. Comparisons were made between samples of cheeses from several Stilton producers and the results suggested that although the levels of the groups of microorganisms tested were similar, the species of lactobacilli and yeasts present were different. This suggests that the indigenous microflora may have a significant impact on the flavour of cheeses from individual production sites. It was concluded that the microflora of Blue Stilton cheese may have a significant impact on the quality of the product both in terms of flavour and the development of the blue veins...|$|E

Phylogenetic tree reconstruction based on nucleotide sequence comparison of the D 1 /D 2 region of the 26 S rRNA gene showed that Pichia terricola and Pichia fermentans are the closest relatives of the unknown species. The name Candida cabralensis sp. nov. is proposed, and the isolate 1 AD 8 T (=CECT 13027 T =CBS 11679 T) is the type strain of this novel taxon. © 2010 IUMS.
