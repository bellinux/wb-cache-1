40|$|Parker and Carlisle (Journal of Advanced Nursing 24, 771 – 778) {{argue that}} there is a {{scarcity}} of empirical research focusing on issues such as supernumerary status and mentorship in Project 2000 courses from the students’ perspective. This paper presents the findings of a longitudinal cohort study using Grounded Theory to discover the effect(s) of mentorship on student nurses following the introduction of the 1992 programme of education leading to a Diploma of Higher Education in Nursing and registration with the United Kingdom Central Council (UKCC). The cohort consisted of 10 students from a large Scottish College of Nursing and Midwifery who were interviewed on five occasions during the three years of their course. Students also kept a diary to record their thoughts and experiences regarding mentorship during their practice placements. In addition, a further seven students volunteered to participate by diary only. Data were analysed with the aid of NUD. IST and subjected to the constant comparative method of analysis. Findings indicate that Diploma students quickly lose their idealistic view of their mentor and over time develop an insight into the qualities they perceive are required of an effective mentor. Students quickly become {{aware of the importance of}} choosing good role models and learning their own mentor’s likes and dislikes as they realize this impinges on the outcome of their assessment.

40|$|Nursing {{education}} has undergone radical change {{during the last}} decade. All nursing programmes are now based in Institutions of Higher Education. While {{many aspects of the}} implications of these changes have been investigated, little research has been published concerning the approaches to learning adopted by student nurses. The Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students (ASSIST) is a tool designed to investigate preferences for different approaches to learning. It was administered to 296 students undertaking the Diploma of Higher Education in Nursing programme of De Montfort University, Leicester.;The responses provided by the students were analysed using the constructs of the original authors (deep, surface and strategic approaches). The data was then subjected to factor analysis. There was found to be a high level of consistency between the original constructs and the factors extracted, and it was thus concluded that the inventory was probably a valid tool for use with the sample population.;The approaches to learning favoured by various subgroups of the population were examined. Thus comparison could be drawn between male and female students, between younger and more mature students, between students with different previous academic qualifications, and between students undertaking different nursing branch programmes.;It was found that deep approaches to learning were most favoured overall, {{and that there was no}} change in approach as the students progressed through the course. Older students showed an increased preference for deep approaches when compared to younger students, and male students showed similar preference when compared to female students.

40|$|Cadherin- 7 (Cad 7) and cadherin- 6 B (Cad 6 B) are {{expressed}} in early and late phases of cranial motoneuron development, respectively. Cad 7 is expressed by cranial motoneurons soon after they are generated, {{as well as in}} the environment through which their axons extend. By contrast, Cad 6 B is expressed by mature cranial motoneurons. We demonstrate in chick that these cadherins play distinct roles in cranial motor axon morphology, branching and projection. Using in vitro approaches, we show that Cad 7 enhances motor axon outgrowth, suppresses the formation of multiple axons and restricts interstitial branching, thus promoting the development of a single unbranched axon characteristic of differentiating motoneurons. Conversely, Cad 6 B in vitro promotes motor axon branching, a characteristic of mature motoneurons. In vivo gain- and loss-of-function experiments for these cadherins yielded phenotypes consistent with this interpretation. In particular, a loss of cadherin-mediated interactions in vivo led to dysregulation of the cranial motoneuron normal <b>branching</b> <b>programme</b> and caused axon navigation defects. We also demonstrate that Cad 6 B functions via the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase pathway.

Both enhanced ureteric expression of Cer 1 and Cer 1 knock out enlarge kidney size, and these changes are associated with an altered three-dimensional structure of the ureteric tree as revealed by optical projection tomography.

These changes may be the reasons for the modified spatial arrangement of the ureteric tree in the kidneys of Cer 1 + embryos.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of post-qualifying {{education}} courses exist for community mental health nurses (CMHNs) working in the UK. ‘Specialist practitioner’ courses emphasize shared learning between CMHNs and members of other community nursing <b>branches.</b> These <b>programmes</b> typically include course content drawing on the social and behavioural sciences, {{as well as on}} material more tailored to the clinical needs of practitioners. Such courses and their predecessors have been subject to criticism, however. Courses have been described as anachronistic, and failing to take account of recent advances in treatment modalities. In addition concerns about the generic focus of some programmes have also been raised. Educational alternatives, such as programmes preparing nurses and other mental health workers to provide ‘psycho-social interventions’ have, correspondingly, become increasingly popular. In this paper we explore some of the debates surrounding the education of CMHNs, and explore the context in which CMHNs work and in which educational programmes are devised. We consider the multidisciplinary environment in which CMHNs practise, the differing client groups with which CMHNs work, the developing policy framework in which mental health care is provided, demands for more user-responsive education, and the relationship between higher educational institutions and health care providers. We conclude the paper with a series of questions for CMHN educators and education commissioners...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{practice}} component of United Kingdom (UK) pre-registration nurse education. In particular, the research has concentrated on one school of health - {{part of a larger}} higher education institution, in the UK and has explored how the institution ensures the quality of the practice component of two of its pre-registration nurse education programmes, the Adult and Mental Health <b>branch</b> <b>programmes.</b> A ‘Major Review’ inspection of these programmes was undertaken in 2005 as part of the requirement of the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) (2001). The research analysed whether the precepts that relate to the practice component of the school’s pre-registration programmes were being implemented, enacted and experienced by those engaged in them. To achieve this Yin’s (2003) qualitative case study approach was adopted, involving interviewing senior lecturers (n= 9), mentors (n= 7) and student nurses (n= 8) and undertaking in depth analysis of relevant documentation. The findings identified that the precepts themselves did not directly influence what the link tutors and mentors did. As a result, the student nurses experienced different levels of support from link tutors and mentors. This prevented students from experiencing a standardised approach to the practice component of the programmes studied. From this it has been concluded that the ethos of the Major Review process has had no long term impact with regards to standardising and quality assuring the practice component of the programmes studied, a finding that has not been formally reported elsewhere. Instead individual values, beliefs and practices dominated {{the way in which the}} players studied operated. The study also highlights how broad and non-descript the precepts themselves are in guiding the school towards a standardised approach to the practice component of the programmes in question. All but one of the precepts ‘Staff Development’ were evidenced as being implemented and/or experienced. Having researched the placement learning precepts (QAA 2001) in their entirety, which has never been done before, it became evident that whilst the content of all of the precepts had been included in the documentary data studied (Clinical Assessment of Practice Documents, School Plan and Pathway Guide), this did not guarantee that all of the precepts were fully implemented and enacted by relevant players. This was because the instruction and guidance within the documents studied were often broad and non specific, to which the design of the precepts allowed. The outcome of this enabled a) link tutors to interpret their roles and responsibilities in different ways; b) theory practice gaps to emerge, which ranged from weak partnership relationships between link tutors and practice placement mangers; c) mentors and link tutors interpreting the CAPD differently and d) mentors mentoring and assessing students in different ways. This resulted in students nursing experiencing different types of learning opportunities and assessment practices that did not always match the learning and development that may be needed in order to practice as a competent and confident registered nurse, at the point of registration. Additionally, there was a lack of understanding by all players about local quality assurance systems and processes. This ranged from none of the participants being familiar with the complaints procedures, or being clear about how placement learning experiences were monitored and evaluated. As a result of these findings the competence of the personnel (link tutors and mentors) studied has been questioned. A phenomenon that highlighted that precept 6 ‘Staff Development’ (which required institutions to ensure that staff who are involved in placement learning are competent to fulfil their role), was not being demonstrably implemented or enacted. A series of recommendations have been designed to meet both the needs of the school studied and others similar. Some of the recommendations relating to the school studied have already been implemented with positive effect. This was evidenced when the researched school was confirmed as having an ‘Outstanding Level of Achievement’ for practice learning following a more recent quality assurance inspection by HLSP on behalf of the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

The study {{is based upon the}} life stories of women participating in a micro finance programme within the Red Cross in Uganda, Entebbe <b>branch.</b> A microfinance <b>programme</b> means giving financial services in the form of small loans for poor people in developing countries. Our purpose is to examine why the women participating in the programme need support to start up their own businesses. Further our emphasis is to examine how the programme affects and changes the life situation of the women participating. Our dissertation is an attempt to an ethnographic study. Empirical findings mainly consist of information gained through conversations with Red Cross workers and women participating in the programme and visits to villages and women groups. A qualitative strategy can further give a description of our methodological approach; we analysed how the women participants themselves described and interpreted their life situation. The study’s results describe how the women’s subordination in relation to men affects to their limited access to resources and vulnerability to poverty. The women’s subordination in the villages is recognized trough situations of exploitation, monopolisation and an acceptance of their marginalised position. Women are by men many times deprived from their benefits in work and excluded from important resources as for example education, because of their allotted labour. The women’s response to their subordination is acceptance, which preserves their situation. The Red Cross micro finance programme improves the women’s life situation in many ways but do not focus on changing their subordination in relation to men, which is the main factor that limits their access to resources and keeps them from rupturing their marginalisation...|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary Context Local and {{national}} concerns regarding competency in newly qualified practitioners provided {{the impetus for}} the undergraduate nursing programme team at Bournemouth University to radically change the practice assessment tool as part of a curriculum rewrite in 2005. Alongside the introduction of the new practice profile, an evaluation strategy was implemented with two stages; Phase One focused on year one of implementation and reported {{at the end of that}} year (2005 - 6). These findings were used to inform mentor education and to amend the tool for new students and those moving into year two. This phase used a qualitative approach to collect data from focus groups with students and mentors (Adult Branch only), and practice/HEI educators concerning their experiences of using the grading practice assessment scheme. Phase Two utilised the qualitative findings to develop a questionnaire survey. Questionnaires were selected as the research tool in order to access greater numbers of students and mentors from across all <b>branch</b> <b>programmes.</b> Education staff was not surveyed in this phase. Purpose and project aim The purpose of the project was to evaluate the impact of the new practice assessment scheme from the perspective of the users and to make suggestions to key stakeholders for quality improvement where necessary. Phase One of the evaluation involved small numbers and only Adult branch students; whilst the findings were informative, it seemed important to test these out on a wider sample. The aim of Phase Two of the grading practice evaluation was to explore: • mentor and student experiences of using the assessment tool across all nursing branches • the impact of quality assurance processes Pertinent literature An overview of the historical and current context of practice assessment for nurses in the UK was provided, including the policy literature from the statutory body. Research on practice assessment in nursing was found to be relatively limited particularly concerning the grading of practice. Key studies include Bondy (1983; 1984) and Hillegas & Valentine (1986) from the USA, Glover et al. (1997) from Australia; from the UK, Burns (1992) and Scammell et al. (2007). All studies had limitations but generally the notion of grading practice was well received by users; however there were concerns about quality assurance processes particularly around reliability as well as issues concerning mentor/practice assessor preparation. In light of an increased national emphasis on nurses’ competency in practice, empirical work that evaluates a new practice assessment initiative is timely. Whilst of value locally in terms of reviewing and improving processes, the findings may also interest colleagues elsewhere. Project design A questionnaire survey of mentors and year two and three nursing students was undertaken to investigate their experiences of using the grading practice assessment tool. All branches of nursing were successfully targeted for inclusion using convenience sampling, but no learning disability students opted to participate. Mentors were accessed via an annual mentor conference; students were accessed via tutor groups. 112 (86 %) of the 130 mentors available, completed and returned the questionnaire. The branch representation was adult nursing (62. 5 %; n= 70), Mental Health (21. 4 %; n= 24), Child Health (17 %; n= 19) and Learning Disability (1. 8 %; n= 2). Questionnaires were distributed to 210 students; 107 were completed (51 % response). The sample comprised Adult branch (72 %; n= 77), Mental Health (19. 6 %; n= 21) and Child Health students (8. 4 %; n= 9). The response rate broadly reflected the proportion of students enrolled within each branch of the targeted cohorts. Most student respondents were undertaking year 3 of their programme (70. 1 %; n= 73); the exception was Child Health where all students were undertaking year 2. As an evaluation study, formal ethical approval was not sought; however permission was granted to conduct the evaluation by the Associate Dean for Nursing, and the educational leads within placement areas. There was a project steering group with representatives of all parties including students and mentors; their role was to oversee the project process and to liase with colleagues within their organisations. Quantitative data was coded and inputted into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS for Windows version 15. 0); where possible chi-square analysis was undertaken to explore whether the results were significant. Qualitative aspects of the questionnaire were transcribed and a content analysis was undertaken. Given the sample size, it is not possible to generalise from this evaluation. Others may judge transferability to other settings. In reviewing the findings, a number of limitations must be acknowledged. The most significant limitations are that no Learning Disability students opted to participate and the response rate generally from students was not as high as anticipated (51 %). This is however a reasonable response rate for a questionnaire survey but if time had permitted, an extension to the convenience sampling may have been beneficial. Other limitations include the fact that findings were generated from reported practice and, as such, may be subject to distortions of memory. Findings Five key areas emerged from the findings: questions around mentor education indicated that participation in updates was high although the sampling process may have introduced some bias. Indeed poor uptake was identified in Phase One, reflecting other studies and anecdotal evidence for the programme team. The findings around support for practice education were mixed; mentors appeared to want more support than was available. Student experience varied according to branch – Mental health students feeling most supported and Child Health the least. However the use of neutral grades was high in both mentor and student groups indicating some cause for concern. Perception on use of the profile in terms of whether it was fit for purpose indicated positive responses overall but some confusion from both students and mentors as to the status of the written sections in comparison with skills performance; the latter was perceived as the top priority. The fourth area focused on how grading ‘worked’ and yielded some valuable perceptions. Generally respondents liked and wanted to grade or be graded in practice. Whilst the majority of mentors claimed to use the descriptors and found them useful, the number who did not use them was of concern. There were mixed perceptions of the appropriate use of second marking, some students perceiving that they were given middle grades due to logistical problems in accessing second markers, although this was not supported by the mentor data. The vast majority of mentors expressed confidence in grading students. However a significant minority responded neutrally or negatively or did not answer the question when asked whether they felt confident to fail a student. This finding is important when considered alongside the neutral response to feeling supported. Finally accountability within the assessment process appeared strong, although at times profiles were signed by staff who had not worked with the student. It is unclear however whether these mentors were primary mentors or those functioning as second markers. Overview of discussion The Phase Two evaluation was broadly supportive of the Phase One findings but extended these to other nursing branches and has provided more useful detail on some of the issues underpinning the grading practice scheme. Quality assurance is a prime issue: the evaluation has shown that reliability of the tool could be improved if the descriptors are clear and robust processes are in place to ensure these are consistently applied. Second marking is another feature of reliability and perceptions varied as to whether this was utilised as much as required and is an issue for programme and placement staff to consider, particularly in the light of inter-branch discrepancies. Students and mentors should be encouraged to constructively make any concerns known. Education around grading and support for mentors was another key area; there perhaps can never be enough support but if any staff have concerns around failing students, this needs to be addressed. The reasons for differing perceptions of support across branches, needs to be explored further. Overall the grading of competency in nursing practice yields far more benefits than problems. It is an innovative scheme, not without challenges; both evaluation phases provide valuable data to focus quality improvement effectively. Conclusion The evaluation captured the views of mentors and students representing all nursing branches, with the exception of Learning Disability students. The issues raised across the branches were broadly similar, notably that the notion of grading practice was welcomed as a means of valuing the practice element of the programme, although implementation was not without challenges. These are reflected in the focus on the quality assurance processes and in fact this is where the branch experience differs most. Mental Health students felt the most supported in placement, were the most likely to receive grades that required to be second marked (indicating full use of the grading range) and were most satisfied that mentor comments matched the grades awarded. In contrast Child Health students were the least satisfied in all these parameters. Adult branch students gave mainly neutral responses which indicate some underlying issues worthy of further investigation. It can be concluded from the mentor data that experience across branches did not differ markedly. The sample accessed updates and most felt confident in grading practice. However almost 18 % did not feel confident about failing students and almost another 20 % gave a neutral response to this question, indicating a need for further staff development in this area as well as a review of processes designed to support mentors in making these judgements. Recommendations • Explore ways of engaging learning disability students in sharing their perspective on the practice assessment tool and processes. • Increase transparency of communication channels between placement providers and the university regarding practice assessment. - Flowcharts or algorithms for mentors and students might be useful - Include these on the back of each practice profile • Review support mechanisms for students within placements. Identify best practice and include minimal standards on the clinical audit documentation to increase parity between placements and branches. • Investigate peer support schemes for students in practice which include preparation and support for those undertaking this role. • Child Health programme team should review support for students with practice partners to identify specific issues for improvement. • Review level descriptors with students, mentors as well as programme teams to ensure clarity of language and processes. • Re-emphasise the use of descriptors in mentor education as well as student preparation for placement • Review criteria and processes for second marking and emphasise within mentor education. • Disseminate HSC audit of practice profiles on a placement provider organisation basis and include a focus on quality of feedback in relation to grade awarded. • Review current practice around preparing and supporting mentors in failing students and develop an action plan for implementation over the next academic year...|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{induction}} of galactosidases by yeasts of genus Cryptococcus growing on lactose medium and relations between this production and growth of yeasts. At the end biotyping using mass spectrometry is described. All tested and relative yeasts, hydrolytic enzymes -, -galactosidase and used analytical methods as UV-VIS spectrophotometry and mass spectometry, especially MALDI-TOF are described in the theoretical part. The experimental part consists of description of instrumentations, preparation of necessary solutions, cultivation of microorganisms, measurement of enzymatic activity spectrophotometrically and biotyping of yeasts by mass spectrometry. Each of the 18 tested yeast strains, including species Cr. canescens (CCY 17 - 3 - 13), Cr. flavescens (CCY 17 - 3 - 6, CCY 17 - 3 - 15, CCY 17 - 3 - 29, CCY 17 - 3 - 31, CCY 17 - 3 - 33, CCY 17 - 3 - 38), Cr. flavus (CCY 17 - 3 - 5), Cr. laurentii (CCY 17 - 3 - 2, CCY 17 - 3 - 9, CCY 17 - 3 - 17, CCY 17 - 3 - 24), Cr. magnus (CCY 17 - 4 - 39, CCY 17 - 4 - 40), Cr. saitoi (CCY 17 - 3 - 18), Cr. victoriae (CCY 17 - 3 - 26) and Bulleromyces albus (CCY 17 - 3 - 35, CCY 17 - 3 - 37) from the Culture Collection of Yeasts, Institute of Chemistry of SAS (CCY), was cultured for 96 hours in a liquid medium with lactose. During cultivation, the quantity of cells was determined as well as enzyme activities of - and -galactosidase in the medium and on the cell surface. Lactose medium was shown not to be suitable culture medium for all Cryptococcus strains, because some of them grew on it very slowly (CCY 17 - 3 - 29, CCY 17 - 3 - 5, CCY 17 - 3 - 26, CCY 17 - 3 - 35), or showed a long adaptation phase (CCY 17 - 3 - 2, CCY 17 - 3 - 6). A comparison of the growth and surface -galactosidase production curves showed that the link between lactose medium and production of this enzyme {{does not exist in}} generally. The results did not confirm neither the expected impact of this enzyme on the growth of strains nor the anticipated induction of -galactosidase by lactose. For instance, the fastest growth on lactose showed the strain Cr. canescens CCY 17 - 3 - 13, which exhibited a very low activity of this enzyme on its surface. Relatively increased production of this enzyme was observed on the surfaces of the type strain Cr. laurentii CCY 17 - 3 - 2, strain Cr. flavescens CCY 17 - 3 - 31 and Cr. flavus CCY 17 - 3 - 5. The production of -galactosidase by capsular yeasts was strain-dependent {{with the exception of the}} members of Cr. flavescens species. Because of this, the expected general influence of this enzyme on the re-building of the protective cryptococcal capsule can be excluded. Only Cr. flavescens strains can be generally considered as producers of lactose-inducible surface -galactosidase. In other cases, the production of this enzyme matters on single strain and not on species, as can be seen in the case of type strain Cr. laurentii and the other Cr. laurentii strains. Similar induction by lactose medium was also observed with non-cryptococcus yeasts and fungi and therefore the link with the capsules can be also excluded. In connection with the selected culture medium, the second aim of this work was to test the suitability of lactose medium for genus Cryptococcus biotyping by mass spectrometry. Normalized spectra showed very low score between strains of the same species and as a consequence, close related strains were included in the different evolutionary <b>branches</b> using Biotyper <b>programme.</b> These findings led to the conclusion that lactose medium is an unsuitable medium...|$|R
