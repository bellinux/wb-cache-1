25|$|The Impact Global Championship of Impact Wrestling, {{formerly}} Total Non-stop Action Wrestling (TNA), {{can also}} be traced <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Heavyweight Wrestling Championship.

25|$|An ogbanje is a reincarnating evil {{spirit that}} would {{deliberately}} plague {{a family with}} misfortune. In folklore, the ogbanje upon being born by the mother, under {{a certain amount of}} time (usually before puberty), would deliberately die and then come back and repeat the cycle, causing the family grief. This time period varies between minutes, hours, days and years. Female circumcision was sometimes thought to get rid of the evil spirit, whereas finding the evil spirits Iyi-uwa, which they have dug somewhere secret, would ensure the ogbanje would never plague the family with misfortune again. The Iyi-uwa is a stone that the ogbanje's way of coming <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and also a way of finding its targeted family. The stone is deep enough to not have been planted physically by a child. The iyi-uwa is dug out by a priest and destroyed. Furthermore, female ogbanje die during pregnancies along with the baby, male ogbanje die before the birth of a wife's baby or the baby dies. The child is confirmed to no longer be an ogbanje after the destruction of the stone or after they successfully give birth to another baby.|$|E
25|$|Spiritism is a Christian {{philosophy}} codified in the 19th {{century by}} the French educator Allan Kardec. Spiritism teaches reincarnation or rebirth into human life after death. This basically distinguishes Spiritism from Spiritualism. According to the Spiritist doctrine, reincarnation explains {{the moral and}} intellectual differences among men. It also provides the path to man's moral and intellectual perfection by amending for his mistakes and increasing his knowledge in successive lives. For this reason Spiritism does not accept rebirth in animals as this would be retrogressive. Reincarnation is the natural method of the perfection process through which the Spirit faces countless different situations, problems and obstacles, and needs {{to learn how to}} deal with them. The central tenet of Spiritist doctrine is the belief in spiritual life. The spirit is eternal, and evolves through a series of incarnations in the material world. The true life is the spiritual one; life in the material world is just a short-termed stage, where the spirit has the opportunity to learn and develop its potentials. Reincarnation is the process where the spirit, once free in the spiritual world, comes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> for further learning.|$|E

[...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order to really get on the same page, I need to show you what this world looks and feels like.

500|$|Armies are {{recruited}} in the cities, {{and their}} maintenance {{contributes to the}} monthly expenditure. [...] Troops consist of infantry, cavalry, and bowmen.

[...] The battle maps differ from the World Map in that each spot has a limit on its number of occupantsa stacking limit. [...] The player and computer take turns to deploy and move their forces. [...] Units move at their standard pace or at a forced march to cover greater distances per turn in battles. [...] Certain terrain gives defensive bonuses to their occupants, reducing the damage they suffer when coming under attack. [...] Offensives {{take the form of}} melee, charges, missiles, and magic.
