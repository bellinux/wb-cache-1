In the resulting skirmish, scores of Jordanian security forces were killed and 125 homes razed. This raid was one of several factors that led to the 1967 Six-Day War.|$|E

5|$|SS Samuel Huntington was an American liberty ship during World War II. She was the 248th liberty ship {{authorized}} by the United States Maritime Commission and was {{named in honor of}} Samuel Huntington, a signer of the American Declaration of Independence. SS Samuel Huntington was launched in 1942 and sailed to ports in the Pacific, South America, Africa, and the United Kingdom. She was one of a select group of liberty ships that were outfitted to carry a limited number of either troops or prisoners of war. As part of a convoy to resupply the Allied troops at Anzio, she sank after a successful German <b>bomb</b> <b>attack</b> in January 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack was}} part of the Provisional IRA's {{campaign}} since 1970 aimed at forcing the British government to withdraw from Northern Ireland. Although Manchester had been the target of IRA bombs before 1996, it had not been subjected to an attack on this scale. In February 1996, the IRA had ended its seventeen-month ceasefire with a large truck <b>bomb</b> <b>attack</b> on London's Canary Wharf financial district, though the 3,300-pound bomb of Manchester was {{three times the size of}} Canary Wharf. The Manchester bombing was condemned by the British and Irish governments and U.S. President Bill Clinton. Five days after the blast, the IRA issued a statement in which it claimed responsibility, but regretted causing injury to civilians.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} of poor health, Suramarit, Sihanouk's father, died on 3April 1960 which Sihanouk blamed upon the shock {{that his father had}} {{received}} from the parcel <b>bomb</b> <b>attack.</b> The following day, the royal throne council met to choose Monireth as regent. Over the next two months, Sihanouk introduced constitutional amendments to create the new post of Head of State of Cambodia, which provided ceremonial powers equivalent to that of the king. A referendum held on 5June 1960 approved Sihanouk's proposals, and Sihanouk was formally appointed Head of State on 14June 1960. As the head of state, Sihanouk took over various ceremonial responsibilities of the king, such as holding public audiences and leading the Royal Ploughing Ceremony. At the same time, he continued to play an active role in politics as Sangkum's leader.|$|E

5|$|After {{the border}} reopened, the British {{government}} reduced the {{military presence in}} Gibraltar by closing the naval dockyard. The RAF presence was also downgraded; although the airport officially remains an RAF base, military aircraft are no longer permanently stationed there. The British garrison, which had been present since 1704, was withdrawn in 1990 following defence cutbacks {{at the end of}} the Cold War. A number of military units continue to be stationed in Gibraltar under the auspices of British Forces Gibraltar; the garrison was replaced with locally recruited units of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, while a Royal Navy presence is continued through the Gibraltar Squadron, responsible for overseeing the security of Gibraltar's territorial waters. In March 1988 a British military operation against members of the Provisional IRA (PIRA) planning a car <b>bomb</b> <b>attack</b> in Gibraltar ended in controversy when the Special Air Service shot and killed all three PIRA members.|$|E
5|$|In December 1958 Ngo Dinh NhuDiem's {{younger brother}} and chief adviserbroached {{the idea of}} {{orchestrating}} a coup to overthrow Sihanouk. Nhu contacted Dap Chhuon, Sihanouk's Interior Minister, who {{was known for his}} pro-American sympathies, to prepare for the coup against his boss. Chhuon received covert financial and military assistance from Thailand, South Vietnam, and the CIA. In January 1959 Sihanouk learned of the coup plans through intermediaries who were in contact with Chhuon. The following month, Sihanouk sent the army to capture Chhuon, who was summarily executed {{as soon as he was}} captured, effectively ending the coup attempt. Sihanouk then accused South Vietnam and the United States of orchestrating the coup attempt. Six months later, on 31August 1959, a small packaged lacquer gift, which was fitted with a parcel bomb, was delivered to the royal palace. Norodom Vakrivan, the chief of protocol, was killed instantly when he opened the package. Sihanouk's parents, Suramarit and Kossamak, who were sitting in another room not far from Vakrivan, narrowly escaped unscathed. An investigation traced the origin of the parcel bomb to an American military base in Saigon. While Sihanouk publicly accused Ngo Dinh Nhu of masterminding the <b>bomb</b> <b>attack,</b> he secretly suspected that the US was also involved. The incident deepened his distrust of the US.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Germanophile mouthpieces, Seara stated {{its support for}} the Central Powers early on, before such financing could occur—even before its patron Cantacuzino decided which side he supported. In the months of strife which preceded the actual war, the Romanian daily published telegrams and concerned commentary {{about the effects of}} nationalism in Central Europe and the Balkans. These accused the Greek Kingdom and Northern Epirote militias of decimating the Aromanian community in Korçë during April 1914, and urged Romanians to express their indignation. A month later, Seara was taking a stand against Romanian irredentism over Transylvania, as analyzed by the Transylvanian Germanophile Ioan Slavici. Slavici's texts scandalized the nationalist press for supporting Vasile Mangra, the pro-Hungarian priest and suspected agent of influence. However, the newspaper was also criticizing the Hungarian authorities for demanding the extradition of university student Măndăchescu. The latter, Seara reported, was wrongly accused of a <b>bomb</b> <b>attack</b> on the Diocese of Hajdúdorog, when the act was more likely attributable to the revolutionist Ilie Cătărău.|$|E

5|$|On 6 June 1944, American, British and Canadian forces {{established}} a western front with the D-Day landings in Normandy. On 20 July 1944, Hitler narrowly survived a <b>bomb</b> <b>attack.</b> He ordered brutal reprisals, resulting in 7,000arrests and {{the execution of}} more than 4,900people. The failed Ardennes Offensive (16 December 1944– 25 January 1945) was the last major German campaign of the war as Soviet forces entered Germany on 27 January. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat and his repeated insistence that the war be fought to the last man led to unnecessary death and destruction in the closing months of the war. Through his Justice Minister Otto Georg Thierack, Hitler ordered that anyone who {{was not prepared to}} fight should be summarily court-martialed and thousands of people were put to death. In many areas, people looked for ways to surrender to the approaching Allies in spite of exhortations of local leaders to continue the struggle. Hitler also ordered the intentional destruction of transport, bridges, industries and other infrastructure—a scorched earth decree—but Armaments Minister Albert Speer was able to keep this order from being fully carried out.|$|E
5|$|The guerrilla bands {{became known}} as the Black Hand (al-kaff al-aswad), an anti-Zionist and anti-British militant organization. The idea for such a group {{appeared}} to have crystallized after the 1929 riots. From the outset, a split occurred in the movement. One faction led by Abu Ibrahim al-Kabir argued for immediate attacks against British and Jewish targets, while the other faction, headed by al-Qassam, thought than an armed revolt was premature and risked exposing the group's preparations. According to Subhi Yasin, a comrade of al-Qassam, the group's attacks in the north were executed by Abu Ibrahim's group in defiance of al-Qassam, though in 1969, Abu Ibrahim denied this allegation. The Black Hand's ensuing campaign began with the ambush and killing of three members of Kibbutz Yagur on 11 April 1931, a failed <b>bomb</b> <b>attack</b> on outlying Jewish homes in Haifa in early 1932, and several operations that killed or wounded four members of northern Jewish settlements. The campaign climaxed with the deaths of a Jewish father and son in Nahalal, from a bomb thrown into their home, on 22 December 1932.|$|E
