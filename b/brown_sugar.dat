5|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>Sugar</b> is {{the debut}} album of American R singer and multi-instrumentalist D'Angelo. It was {{released}} on July 4, 1995, by EMI Music. Recording sessions for the album took place from 1994 to 1995 at Battery Studios and RPM Studios in New York City and at the Pookie Lab in Sacramento. Production, instrumentation, arrangements, and songwriting were primarily handled by D'Angelo, who employed both vintage recording equipment and modern electronic devices. <b>Brown</b> <b>Sugar</b> contains themes of love and romance, and features a fusion of contemporary R and traditional soul music, along with elements of funk, quiet storm, and hip hop music.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of his debut album <b>Brown</b> <b>Sugar</b> (1995), D'Angelo went into a four and a half year absence from the music scene and {{releasing}} solo work. His debut album presented a musical fusion of traditional soul and R influences with hip hop vocal and production elements, serving as fundamental elements for the neo soul sound. With its single-oriented success, <b>Brown</b> <b>Sugar</b> earned considerable sales success and defied the contemporary, producer-driven sound of the time, while earning popularity among mature R audiences and the growing hip hop generation. Prior to its release, neo soul itself was undefined by a major artist or musical work, and was developing during the early 1990s through the work of artists such as Tony! Toni! Toné!, Me'Shell NdegéOcello, and Omar. The album also earned D'Angelo recognition for producing a commercial breakthrough for the genre and giving notice to other neo soul artists, including Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell.|$|E

5|$|As a term, neo {{soul was}} coined by Kedar Massenburg of Motown Records {{in the late}} 1990s as a {{marketing}} category following the commercial breakthroughs of artists such as D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. The success of D'Angelo's 1995 debut album <b>Brown</b> <b>Sugar</b> has been regarded by several writers and music critics as inspiration behind the term's origin. While some artists have ignored the label, others have received the designation with controversy because it may seem contrived to music audiences and imply that soul music had ended {{at some point in}} time. In a 2002 interview for Billboard, Massenburg said that genre classifications are often unpopular because they may be suggestive of a short-lived trend. However, although he said neo soul is still essentially soul music, Massenburg felt there was a need to market artists of the genre for listeners to have an understanding of what they were buying.|$|E
5|$|Born to a Pentecostal-minister father, D'Angelo {{was brought}} up to an early {{appreciation}} of gospel music, while his mother, a jazz enthusiast, {{introduced him to the}} musical complexities of trumpeter Miles Davis and the funk and soul music of the 1970s. In addition to old gospel records, these factors inspired him during the making of <b>Brown</b> <b>Sugar,</b> as D'Angelo drew upon his roots of traditional gospel and soul, and infused the sound of contemporary R and hip hop music to create a stylistically unique and soulful sound for the album. The album has been noted by critics for its classic soul elements and influences, as well as the sound of live instruments and organic grooves, which are reminiscent of the work of Stevie Wonder and Sly & the Family Stone. Its production contrasts the producer-driven and digital approach of contemporary R {{at the time of its}} release.|$|E
