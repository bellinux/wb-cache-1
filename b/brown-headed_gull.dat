25|$|The fauna of Ladakh {{has much}} in common with that of Central Asia in general and that of the Tibetan Plateau in particular. Exceptions to this are the birds, many of which migrate from the warmer parts of India to spend the summer in Ladakh. For such an arid area, Ladakh has a great {{diversity}} of birds— a total of 225 species have been recorded. Many species of finches, robins, redstarts (like the black redstart), and the hoopoe are common in summer. The <b>brown-headed</b> <b>gull</b> is seen in summer on the river Indus and on some lakes of the Changthang. Resident water-birds include the brahminy duck also known as the ruddy sheldrake and the bar-headed goose. The black-necked crane, a rare species found scattered in the Tibetan plateau, is also found in parts of Ladakh. Other birds include the raven, Eurasian magpie, red-billed chough, Tibetan snowcock, and chukar. The lammergeier and the golden eagle are common raptors here specially in Changthang region.|$|E

40|$|The {{movements}} of four species of breeding waterbirds were studied using color marking, radio-tracking, and satellite-tracking at Qinghai Lake between April and September, 2006. Forty five bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) were captured with foot traps, including six individuals tagged with radio transmitters in April and another six birds with satellite transmitters in July. A total of 104 brown-headed gulls (Larus brunnicephalus) were captured with hand nets, and six {{of these were}} radio-tagged in April. Fifty one great black-headed gulls (L. ichthyaetus) were captured with foot traps, including two birds that were radio-tagged in April.

40|$|Brown-headed gulls (Larus brunnicephalus), winter {{visitors}} of Thailand, were {{tracked by}} satellite telemetry during 2008 - 2011 for investigating {{their roles in}} the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H 5 N 1 virus spread. Eight gulls negative for influenza virus infection were marked with solar-powered satellite platform transmitters at Bang Poo study site in Samut Prakarn province, Thailand; their movements were monitored by the Argos satellite tracking system, and locations were mapped. Five gulls completed their migratory cycles, which spanned 7 countries (China, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam) affected by the HPAI H 5 N 1 virus. Gulls migrated from their breeding grounds in China to stay overwinter in Thailand and Cambodia; while Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, and Vietnam were the places of stopovers during migration. Gulls traveled an average distance of about 2400 km between Thailand and China and spent 1 - 2 weeks on migration. Although AI surveillance among gulls was conducted at the study site, no AI virus was isolated and no H 5 N 1 viral genome or specific antibody was detected in the 75 gulls tested, but 6. 6 % of blood samples were positive for pan-influenza A antibody. No AI outbreaks were reported in areas along flyways of gulls in Thailand during the study period. Distance and duration of migration, tolerability of the captive gulls to survive the HPAI H 5 N 1 virus challenge and days at viral shedding after the virus challenging suggested that the <b>Brown-headed</b> <b>gull</b> could be a potential species for AI spread, especially among Southeast Asian countries, the epicenter of H 5 N 1 AI outbreak. 1 U 19 CI 000399 /CI/NCPDCID CDC HHS/United States 23209623 PMC 350915...|$|E
