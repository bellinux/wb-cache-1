40|$|Abstract Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} if various convenient and cost affordable body composition techniques correlate well with more expensive “gold standard ” instruments for measuring body composition in female collegiate athletes. Methods: Thirty-two Division I track and field and basketball female athletes participated in the study. The host university’s Institutional Review Board approved the protocols towards ethical treatment of all subjects before the study commenced. Within one hour, each subject underwent body composition assessments via air displacement plethysmography (ADP), skinfold (SF) measurements, and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Results: No significant differences were found between basketball and track athletes thus data was normalized. No significant difference in calculated percent <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> was noted between ADP and SF (p =. 002), but there was a significant difference between ADP and BIA (p =. 478). Per Pearson correlations, moderate correlations existed between <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> <b>percentages</b> obtained by ADP and SF (r =. 689) as well as between <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> <b>percentages</b> estimated by ADP and BIA (r =. 447).

25|$|In {{contrast}} with clinical tools, one relatively inexpensive {{type of body}} fat meter uses the principle of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) {{in order to determine}} an individual's <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> <b>percentage.</b> To achieve this, the meter passes a small, harmless, electric current through the body and measures the resistance, then uses information on the person's weight, height, age, and sex to calculate an approximate value for the person's <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> <b>percentage.</b> The calculation measures the total volume of water in the body (lean tissue and muscle contain a higher percentage of water than fat), and estimates the percentage of fat based on this information. The result can fluctuate several percentage points depending on what has been eaten and how much water has been drunk before the analysis.|$|E
25|$|The BMI adds roughly 10% {{for a large}} (or tall) {{frame and}} subtracts roughly 10% for a smaller frame (short stature). In other words, persons with small frames would be {{carrying}} more fat than optimal, but their BMI reflects that they are normal. Conversely, large framed (or tall) individuals may be quite healthy, with a fairly low <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> <b>percentage,</b> but be classified as overweight by BMI.|$|E

40|$|Obesity {{has become}} a serious problem in several {{developed}} and developing countries. Three-dimensional photonic scanning (3 DPS) is a useful tool to obtain accurate anthropometric measures and body volume data for body shape quantification. Some traditional models {{have been developed to}} estimate <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> <b>percentages</b> from anthropometric measures or body volume data for body composition classification and obesity quantification. However, these traditional models are very sensitive to the errors in anthropometric measures and body volume data. Small errors in anthropometric measures or body volume data reduces accuracy of <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> <b>percentages</b> estimated from 3 DPS and may lead to misclassifications when quantifying levels of obesity. In this study, pattern recognition techniques, neural networks, were applied to develop a new model which can classify obesity levels from a combination of anthropometric measures and body volume data without estimating <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> <b>percentages.</b> The developed model and the traditional models were applied to determine 2209 male participants’ body composition classes for obesity quantification. The accuracy of the new and the traditional models was determined by comparing the estimated body composition classes with the real body composition classes obtained from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning output. The results showed that the accuracy of the developed model was better than the traditional models.

25|$|Early {{symptoms}} include impulsivity, irritability, and hyperactivity. Atrophy (wasting away) {{of the stomach}} weakens the perception of hunger, since the perception {{is controlled by the}} percentage of the stomach that is empty. Individuals experiencing starvation lose substantial fat (adipose tissue) and muscle mass as the body breaks down these tissues for energy. Catabolysis is the process of a body breaking down its own muscles and other tissues in order to keep vital systems such as the nervous system and heart muscle (myocardium) functioning. The energy deficiency inherent in starvation causes fatigue and renders the victim more apathetic over time. As the starving person becomes too weak to move or even eat, their interaction with the surrounding world diminishes.

40|$|Appropriate {{hydration}} before, during, {{and after}} physical activity {{is an important}} ingredient to healthy and successful sports participation. Weight loss during exercise and other physical activity represents primarily a loss of body water. A loss of just 1 to 2 % of body weight (1. 5 to 3 pounds for a 150 -pound athlete) can negatively impact performance. A loss of 3 % or more of body weight can significantly increase the risk for exertional heat-related illness. If an athlete is already dehydrated prior to beginning activity, these effects will occur even sooner. Athletes should be weighed (in shorts and T-shirt) before and after warm or hot weather practice sessions and contests to assess their hydration status. Athletes with high <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> <b>percentages</b> can become significantly dehydrated and over-heat faster than athletes with lower <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> <b>percentages</b> while working out under the same environmental conditions.

Although different in nature, this approaches the genetic differentiation between men and male chimpanzees or women and female chimpanzees. The genetic difference between sexes contributes to anatomical, hormonal, neural, and physiological differences between men and women, although the exact degree and nature of social and environmental influences on sexes are not completely understood. Males on average are 15% heavier and [...] taller than females. There is a difference between body types, body organs and systems, hormonal levels, sensory systems, and muscle mass between sexes. On average, there is a difference of about 40–50% in upper body strength and 20–30% in lower body strength between men and women. Women generally have a higher <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> <b>percentage</b> than men. Women have lighter skin than men of the same population; this has been explained by a higher need for vitamin D (which is synthesized by sunlight) in females during pregnancy and lactation. As there are chromosomal differences between females and males, some X and Y chromosome related conditions and disorders only affect either men or women. Other conditional differences between males and females are not related to sex chromosomes. Even after allowing for body weight and volume, the male voice is usually an octave deeper than the female voice. Women have a longer life span in almost every population around the world.|$|E

J. Morphol., 29 (4) : 1364 - 1369, 2011. SUMMARY: The rate is assessed as per the <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> <b>percentages</b> (%BF) estimated through anthropometric measurements and manual bioimpedance, according to gender and adiposity rate within the paediatric population. The %BF is assessed by anthropometry using the Slaughter equation for cutaneous skinfolds and manual bioimpedance (Omron model HBF- 306 INTTM) to 321 students (160 females and 161 males) between 10 - 18 years. The association degree among the methods was measured using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). The consistency among methods was analysed through the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and the consistency correlation coefficient of Lin (CCC), grouping the population by gender and adiposity rate. The reference method was the cutaneous skinfolds assessed by the Slaughter equation. Optimum and high adiposity rates were recorded for the studied sample. The r between the bioimpedance and the anthropometry was 0. 689, which corresponds to moderate. However, it decreased according to the gender and adiposity rate (females: optimum 0. 409 and high 0. 610; males: optimum 0. 335 and high 0. 507). The ICC was 0. 668, which also decreased by gender and adiposity rate (females: optimum 0. 323 and high 0. 578; males: optimum 0. 229 and high 0. 506). CCC was poor (< 0. 90) by gender and adiposity rate. The study shows differences for both methods in this age range, which is accentuated by gender and adiposity rate. Therefore, the use of manual bioimpedance as an interchangeable method with the anthropometric measurements in children an...|$|R
