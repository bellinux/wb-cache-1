5|$|In September 1870, Garfield, who {{was then}} {{chairman}} of the House <b>Banking</b> <b>Committee,</b> led {{an investigation into the}} Black Friday Gold Panic scandal. The committee investigation into corruption was thorough, but found no indictable offenses. Garfield blamed the easy availability of fiat money greenbacks for financing the speculation that led to the scandal.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Nixon {{administration}} Mint Director Mary Brooks {{sought the}} reissuance {{of the dollar}} coin. By this time, rising bullion prices threatened the continued use of silver in the Kennedy half dollar, but Brooks hoped to maintain the dollar as a silver coin. Brooks' proposal for a new silver dollar was opposed by {{the chairman of the}} House <b>Banking</b> <b>Committee,</b> Wright Patman, who had been convinced by Nixon's predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, to support the continued use of silver in the half dollar against his better judgment.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota Senator Peter Norbeck also {{introduced}} legislation for a Norse-American medal on February 5, 1925. It {{was referred to}} the Committee on the Library.

Norbeck, on behalf of the <b>Banking</b> <b>Committee,</b> reported the bill favorably and without amendment to the Senate on February 13. It was passed by the Senate without objection or amendment on the 18th.|$|E

5|$|With several {{influential}} committee posts, Neal {{has made}} economic policy {{the focus of}} his career, although his success has been mixed. He served his first two terms on the House <b>Banking</b> <b>Committee,</b> where he served on the Financial Services Subcommittee. As the banking reform law of 1991 was being drafted, he cautioned that President George H.W. Bush's proposal could negatively affect small businesses and minority-owned businesses. He introduced an amendment to require reports on lending to these businesses, which was adopted.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} years, Paul {{served on the}} House <b>Banking</b> <b>Committee,</b> where he blamed the Federal Reserve for {{inflation}} and spoke against the banking mismanagement {{that resulted in the}} savings and loan crisis. Paul argued for a return to the gold standard maintained by the US from 1873–1933, and with Senator Jesse Helms convinced the Congress to study the issue. He spoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to President Jimmy Carter and the majority of his fellow Republican members of Congress.|$|E

5|$|On September 25, 1989, several Republicans from Ohio {{filed an}} ethics {{complaint}} against Glenn, charging {{that he had}} improperly intervened on Keating's behalf. The initial charges against the five Senators were made on October 13, 1989, by Common Cause, a public interest group, who asked for the U.S. Justice Department and the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate {{the actions of the}} senators relative to Lincoln and the contributions received from Keating and whether they violated the rules of the Senate or federal election laws. But the most public attention came from the House <b>Banking</b> <b>Committee,</b> whose new chair Henry B. Gonzalez held 50hours of hearings into the Lincoln failure and associated events.|$|E
5|$|A {{newcomer}} to the Carter administration and to national politics, Goldschmidt traded not only on his experience in transportation planning, but on his political acumen as well; following Carter's unsuccessful bid for re-election, Goldschmidt expressed doubts about the Democratic Party's future if it couldn't learn to cultivate political allies more effectively. Goldschmidt's time in Washington, DC, informed his own understanding of politics, as well. He remained in office through {{the remainder of the}} Carter administration. In late 1979, Republican presidential hopeful John B. Anderson called for Goldschmidt's resignation, and members of the United States Senate <b>Banking</b> <b>Committee</b> later chastised him, for having suggested that he would withhold transportation funds from municipalities, such as Chicago and Philadelphia, whose mayors supported Ted Kennedy in his primary election bid against Carter. Goldschmidt resigned at the conclusion of Carter's term on January 20, 1981.|$|E
5|$|In January 1937, Voorhis's first {{legislative}} initiative was {{to propose a}} dramatic increase in spending for the Works Progress Administration in order to increase employment. While this effort was unsuccessful, Congress, faced with an economic downturn the following year, increased WPA spending beyond the level which Voorhis had sought. While the 75th Congress had in excess of 300Democrats, many of them were conservative, and Voorhis emerged as a leader of a progressive caucus of some 50 representatives. Voorhis advocated the purchase by the Federal Government of the stock in the Federal Reserve Banks, which was held by the member banks, as a way of financing government expenditures and briefly got President Roosevelt to support the measure until the President's advisers caused Roosevelt to change his mind. Voorhis later allied with future House <b>Banking</b> <b>Committee</b> chairman Wright Patman to force Federal Reserve Banks to pay most of the interest they earned on federal securities to the U.S. Government, rather than to the bank stockholders.|$|E

40|$|I {{study the}} policy choices {{of members of}} a central <b>bank</b> <b>committee,</b> who are {{appointed}} by the government. Central bankers balance their desire to protect the Central Bank's reputation against their interest to be reappointed. Committees can be more successful than single central bankers at reducing inflation and insulating policy from government pressures. These gains are only achieved if the turnover rate of committee members is low and the committee is small. The former {{is associated with a}} low risk of being replaced for not supporting the government's preferred policy. The latter, meanwhile, implies high probability that a single vote affects policy, making any individual member more weary of potentially affecting the Central Bank's reputation through his vote.

5|$|One {{proposal}} {{to revive the}} three-cent piece was made in 1911, when Mayors Brand Whitlock of Toledo, Ohio, and Newton D. Baker of Cleveland sent a joint memorial to Congress urging its return. The following year, a subcommittee of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures held a hearing on bills to authorize a copper-nickel three-cent piece and to change {{the composition of the}} cent to copper-nickel. Mint Director George E. Roberts testified and indicated he had no objection to a three-cent piece, as there was at least limited demand for a coin larger than the cent and smaller than the nickel. In 1936, a bill for a three-cent nickel was among various coin legislation considered by the Senate <b>Banking</b> <b>Committee.</b> In 1942, Congress granted the Treasury Secretary the temporary authority to change the composition of the nickel because of wartime metal shortages, and if public demand for the five-cent piece required it, the Mint could strike three-cent pieces. Nothing came of any of the proposals. The three-cent piece was made fully legal tender by the Coinage Act of 1965, which proclaimed all coin and currency of the United States good to any amount for payment of public and private debt. By then, that coin had long since passed from the scene.|$|E
5|$|Payne {{drew up a}} {{compromise}} bill, in which the Resumption Act would be repealed and replaced with a gradual, partial return to gold-backed money. Under the Payne Act, national banks {{would be required to}} build up gold reserves equal to three percent of the value of greenbacks in circulation that year, adding an additional three percent each year until 1885, when they would have gold reserves of thirty percent of the value of circulating greenbacks. At that point, greenbacks would become redeemable in at least thirty percent gold. This compromise was still too much for the Eastern Democrats and Republicans who favored the gold standard, and the <b>Banking</b> <b>Committee</b> refused to approve the bill. Payne contrived to bypass his committee and bring the bill for a vote by the whole House, but it was voted down, 81 to 157. The House later passed a complete repeal of the Resumption Act, 133 to 120, but the Senate declined to take up the matter. Specie resumption remained {{the law of the land}} when the 44th Congress's term expired.|$|E

25|$|This time, the DVLMF {{commemorative}} coin act {{originated in the}} House of Representatives. Representative Dennis Moore (D-Kansas) introduced H.R. 634 in January 2007, and it passed the House 416-to-0 in May. Senator Tim Johnson then introduced companion legislation (S. 2119) in the Senate in October 2007. The DVLMF told members of Congress that the foundation had raised roughly $43 million of the $65 million needed to build the memorial, and that {{commemorative coin}} sales would allow it to complete fundraising in 2008. The Senate <b>Banking</b> <b>Committee</b> favorably reported the legislation on May 20, 2008, with clarifying legislation from Senator Johnson. The Senate adopted the amended bill by a unanimous vote on June 10, and the House adopted the Senate bill on June 18.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, while {{testifying before}} Senator Arlen Specter and the Senate Judiciary Committee about Mack, Pequot Capital and the SEC lack of oversight, {{he warned that}} SEC {{enforcement}} was dangerously lax. He said that the SEC had recovered a mere $110,000 from hedge fund insider trading over one year when the Committee itself had found evidence that over a one-year period, more than 41% of all mergers and acquisitions of over a billion dollars involved insider trading. Aguirre warned that lack of effective oversight of rampant corruption was allowing Wall Street the same unregulated market abuse and leveraging that caused the Wall Street crash of 1929. In 2008, he delivered a similar message at the Sibos conference in Vienna. Just prior {{to the collapse of}} Bear Stearns, he {{wrote a letter to the}} Senate <b>Banking</b> <b>Committee</b> that the nation's banks, and particularly Bear Stearns, were at risk because of subprime debt exposure and credit default swaps. In September 2008, during the debate on the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), Aguirre's projections on the costs of the taxpayer bailout were cited on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E
