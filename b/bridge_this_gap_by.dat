[...] Ghana was separated from Guinea by the countries of the Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone and separated from Mali by the country of Upper Volta. Attempts to <b>bridge</b> <b>this</b> <b>gap</b> <b>by</b> including Upper Volta in the union failed, despite a number of overtures by Nkrumah.

Similarly, although Mali and Guinea share a border, there had been little creation of significant transportation infrastructure between the countries (both of them being more significantly linked to Senegal during the colonial period). Another problem was that the countries had separate linguistic and colonial infrastructures which limited the space for any significant policy unification. In addition, although the parties agreed on many foreign policy goals, they were divided about United Nations Operation in the Congo in 1960 and 1961. Finally, although the agreement was open to all African states, suspicion about Nkrumah and regional politics between the three leaders and Félix Houphouët-Boigny in the Ivory Coast limited the union's expansion.|$|E

50|$|The Hymns for the Use of the Churches, however, only {{provided}} hymntexts, no music. In 1872, Edmund Hart Turpin, organist {{of the central}} church on Gordon Square, helped to <b>bridge</b> <b>this</b> <b>gap</b> <b>by</b> publishing the Hymn Tunes. For each of the 320 hymns in the 1871 edition of the Hymns for the Use of the Churches it contains a tune without the lyrics. Furthermore, it provides four metrical chants, {{one of which was}} written by Edmund Hart Turpin. Most of the hymn tunes were taken from other hymnbooks such as the Hymns Ancient and Modern. In total 39 tunes were newly written by Edmund Hart Turpin. The musical style of the Hymn Tunes is comparable to that of the Hymns Ancient and Modern, the famous hymnal which resulted out of the Oxford Movement in 1861. A comparison of the Hymn tunes with the Hymns for the Use of the Churches shows that most of these new tunes were to support the hymns of Edward Wilton Eddis.|$|E

Regional agglomeration studies emphasize the favourable impact of geographical proximity on performance. However, the firms that constitute those agglomerations largely remain black boxes.

50|$|This text, {{originally}} {{written in}} French as Le Rire de la Méduse in 1975, {{was translated into}} English by Keith and Paula Cohen in 1976. Cixous is issuing her female readers an ultimatum of sorts: either they can read it and choose to stay trapped in their own bodies by a language that does {{not allow them to}} express themselves, or they can use their bodies as a way to communicate. Cixous develops a type rhetoric that has the potential to expand on the purpose of feminist theory as discourse advocating for the rights of women. Écriture feminine is a style of writing that falls outside of the discourse of patriarchal systems and therefore allows women to address their needs and narratives by claiming her identity. This text is situated in a history of feminist rhetoric that separated women in terms of their gender and women in terms of authorship. The “Laugh of the Medusa” works to <b>bridge</b> <b>this</b> <b>gap</b> <b>by</b> placing emphasis on the woman as individual, commanding her to write and use her body as source of power and inspiration. Cixous uses the term the Logic of Antilove to describe her criticism of the systematic oppression by patriarchal figures. She defines the Logic of Antilove as the self-hatred women have, “they have made for women an antinarcissism! A naracissim which loves itself only to be loved by what women haven’t got”, this idea persecutes women by defining them by what misogynistic tradition believes makes the female sex inferior. Cixous commands women to focus on her self as an individual, particularly her body and write to redefine her identity in the context of her history and narrative. She believes writing is a tool women must use to advocate for themselves, in order to acquire the freedom women have historically been denied.|$|E
