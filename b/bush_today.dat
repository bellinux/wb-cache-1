On National Tartan Day, we celebrate the spirit and character of Scottish Americans and recognize their many contributions to our culture and our way of life.Scotland and the United States have long shared ties of family and friendship, and many of our country's most cherished customs and ideals first grew to maturity on Scotland's soil. The Declaration of Arbroath, the Scottish Declaration of Independence signed in 1320, embodied the Scots' strong dedication to liberty, and the Scots brought that tradition of freedom {{with them to the}} New World. Sons and daughters of many Scottish clans were among the first immigrants to settle in America, and their determination and optimism helped build our Nation's character. Several of our Founding Fathers were of Scottish descent, as have been many Presidents and Justices of the United States Supreme Court. Many Scottish Americans, such as Andrew Carnegie, were great philanthropists, founding and supporting numerous scientific, educational, and civic institutions. From the evocative sounds of the bagpipes to the great sport of golf, the Scots have also left an indelible mark on American culture.National Tartan Day is an opportunity to celebrate all Americans who claim Scottish ancestry, and we are especially grateful for the service in our Armed Forces of Scottish Americans who have answered the call to protect our Nation.NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 6, 2008, as National Tartan Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day by celebrating the continued friendship between the people of Scotland and the United States and by recognizing the contributions of Scottish Americans to our Nation.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.GEORGE W.

40|$|Two hundred {{thousand}} acres of wasteland. This land {{known as the}} pakihis stretches intermittently from West Nelson down the coast to South Westland. Flat or gently rolling, a vivid green in colour, it appears to form excellent pasture - yet this land is probably {{some of the most}} unproductive in New Zealand. The extremely leached soil supports a low growth of fern and sedge. Due to impeded drainage the ground is exceedingly wet, often approaching semi-bog conditions. Where it is very flat and low lying considerable stretches of peat may occur. The Maori word pakihi simply means an open clearing in the <b>bush.</b> <b>Today</b> it is not only applied to the vast stretches of open country, but also to poor forest which is gradually giving way to semi-pakihi conditions. In this thesis pakihi is restricted to that land covered by a predominate growth of fern and sedge t and is not applied to those areas of forest which are gradually dying out, nor to out-over land which while carrying a growth of some pakihi species nevertheless also carries a growth of gorse, black-berry and many other weeds. The most extensive area of pakihi is found in the vicinity of Westport - 48, 000 acres occurring in the Buller County alone. Other areas of considerable size are found in the Collingwood and Takaka Counties, Inangahua County, the Maimai plains and areas stretching back from Greymouth and Hokitika.

American missionaries taught local Black children at the Mount Hope and Mount Pleasant schools.

40|$|The war is {{over and}} history is forgotten, says Simon Adams There are things we are not {{supposed}} to mention about the war in Iraq. Like the fact that our troops are participants in the most unpopular war in modern history. Even before a single shot was fired there were massive protests. And since March 20 literally {{millions of people around the}} world have marched against the US-led invasion. The Vietnam War was never this immediately and globally unpopular. Not even after years of napalm, not after My Lai, not ever. While the initial stage of the invasion, with tanks racing across the desert, facilitated a partial boost in approval of the ‘support our troops’ variety, even this has been undermined by the growing death toll of Iraqi civilians and coalition soldiers. The shocking and awful missile barrage of Iraq’s cities, the ongoing ‘pockets of resistance’ which seem much deeper than anyone imagined, and the fact that the most powerful nation in history has so far been mightily unsuccessful in conquering a Third World country, has not helped either. Vietnam must have haunted the dreams of Bush and Rumsfeld in Washington this past week. When Bush the Elder fought the first Gulf War in 1991 he said it shattered forever America’s ‘Vietnam Syndrome’. What then, do we make of the quagmire that his son has now immersed America in? Call it the revenge of history. I’m old enough to remember when Saddam Hussein was our comrade in arms. I lived in America between 1979 and 1983. I recall the yellow ribbons we tied around trees at my school - a ribbon a day, for each of the 444 days the American hostages remained prisoners of fanatical Muslim students in Teheran. Old enough to recall when Ayatollah Khomeini was public enemy number one. Old enough to remember learning that we (meaning the Americans and I, a foreigner) had allies in the Middle East and that one of the greatest of these was the nation of Iraq whose armies were marching against the evil Iranians. When Iraq invaded Iran in 1980 Saddam was considered a potential ally in a treacherous region. His brutal regime was secular and his Ba’ath Party had wiped out the Iraqi Communist Party. Like the Americans, Saddam hated and feared Iran’s Islamic revolution. He seemed like the kind of guy Washington could do business with. The fact that Saddam’s regime brutalised and tortured its own people was a peripheral matter. Bigger issues of geopolitics and American hostages were at stake. In 1982 President Reagan removed Iraq from the US State Department’s list of states that supported terrorism. Throughout the Iran-Iraq War America was openly with Saddam against Iran. The links between Washington and Baghdad extended to the Americans sharing sensitive satellite intelligence with the Iraqi Army so they could wage war more effectively. The US Navy provided armed escorts for Iraqi oil tankers. And in December 1983 US President Ronald Reagan even sent a special envoy - a certain Mr Donald Rumsfeld - to meet Saddam Hussein and establish a closer relationship with the Iraqi dictator. No wonder Rummy claims such insight into the minds of Iraq’s brutal rulers - he’s supped with them as their guest! Not that you’ll hear him mention this on CNN. These days Rummy works for President Bush the Younger as Secretary of Defense. He speaks continually of ‘weapons of mass destruction’ and Saddam’s appalling human rights record. Maybe he really does know something that we don’t. Maybe Saddam took Rummy into his confidence all those years ago in Badghad? After all, the lines between trusted ally and evil tyrant were apparently a lot less clear then than they are <b>today.</b> <b>Bush</b> the Younger, in arguing in favour of an invasion of Iraq, sometimes recalls Iraq’s use of chemical weapons against the Kurds. Like the appalling incident in March 1988 when Iraqi forces gassed over four thousand Kurds in Halabja. Bush has called this an act of attempted genocide. The problem is that none of it is news. The American State Department and CIA were aware of the Iraqi military’s use of chemical weapons throughout the 1980 s while Iraq was a US ally. On 20 March 1984, for instance, US intelligence sources reported that they had ‘incontrovertible evidence that Iraq has used nerve gas in its war with Iran and has almost finished extensive site for mass-producing the lethal chemical agent’. And yet this did not stop the United States from re-establishing full diplomatic ties with Iraq in November that year. Nor did it stop the US from continuing to support Saddam’s war against Iran. Indeed when the US Senate, or the United Nations, attempted to constrain Iraq the Reagan administration intervened. In March 1986, for example, the UN Security Council proposed a declaration against Iraq’s use of chemical weapons. The United States voted against the declaration. Britain and Australia abstained. The war continued. As did the trade, according to a 1994 US Senate Committee Report, of materials used in manufacturing chemical weapons. From 1985 - 1989 about a dozen US companies were involved in exporting biological agents to the Iraqis, assisting them in making, among other things, deadly anthrax. The US Department of Commerce licensed this trade. That is, until the end of the Iran-Iraq War and the Cold War altered the structure of allegiance in the Middle East. The Iran-Iraq War continued until 1988, by which time a million people had been killed. It is now a matter of public record that the Reagan administration secretly traded weapons for hostages with the Iranians in the early 1980 s. What was largely overlooked in the resulting ‘Iran-Contra Scandal’, however, was the fact that Washington had therefore militarily supported both sides of the Iran-Iraq war, possibly prolonging the killing. One million dead. This is only a small part of the history not mentioned on CNN. And certainly not on FoxNews where the disgraced cold warrior Oliver North, the Pentagon’s ‘fallguy’ during the Iran-Contra Scandal, now works as a frontline reporter. This current war in Iraq is an elaborate exercise in political amnesia. No matter how long, or what new twists it takes, it remains morally wrong. As Czech author Milan Kundera once wrote, the struggle for human freedom is the struggle of memory against forgetting. Now more than ever.
