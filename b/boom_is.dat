5|$|Another {{constant}} theme {{which runs}} throughout the Latin American dictator novel, which gained in importance and frequency during the Latin American <b>Boom,</b> <b>is</b> {{the interdependence of}} the Latin American tyrant and United States imperialism. In Mario Vargas Llosa's The Feast of the Goat, for example, Trujillo faces serious opposition shortly after losing his material backing from the CIA, previously held for over 32 years {{in light of his}} anti-communist leanings.|$|E
5|$|Following its sale {{at auction}} {{following}} foreclosure, the Bowers Mansion was abandoned. Eventually purchased by Reno saloon owner Henry Riter, it was renovated and reopened as a resort in 1903. The hot springs were remodeled to feed warm swimming pools, and a spur was built from the Virginia and Truckee Railroad {{to serve the}} property. It continued to operate as a resort until 1946. It is now considered the finest example of the mansion houses built by the millionaire beneficiaries of the Comstock <b>boom,</b> <b>is</b> listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and {{is administered by the}} Washoe County Parks Department.|$|E

5000|$|Electric sensors at {{the ends}} of {{opposing}} <b>booms</b> <b>are</b> used to measure potential differences between separated points, to derive electric fields associated with convection. The method works best at high plasma densities in low Earth orbit; far from Earth long <b>booms</b> <b>are</b> needed, to avoid shielding-out of electric forces.|$|R
25|$|There are {{two common}} types of {{container}} handling gantry crane: high profile, where the <b>boom</b> <b>is</b> hinged at the waterside of the crane structure and lifted {{in the air}} to clear the ships for navigation, and low profile, where the <b>boom</b> <b>is</b> shuttled toward and over the ship to allow the trolley to load and discharge containers. Low-profile cranes are used where they may be in the flight path of aircraft, such as where a container terminal is located close to an airport. The type of crane selected in container terminal design process is determined by the design vessel and local environment.|$|E
25|$|Aktobe has a fast-paced apartment-building boom, {{possibly}} due to {{the expansion}} of the oil industry and immigration from nearby villages. The construction <b>boom</b> <b>is</b> connected with the general economic growth in the region and in Western Kazakhstan.|$|E

25|$|The Super Albatross {{was created}} from a Baby Albatross {{fuselage}} pod and tail boom. The wings used the outer panels of the Senior Albatross.

25|$|Due {{to issue}} with litter, {{both natural and}} man-made, brought to the beach by south-westerly gales, regular litter picks are organised, which {{involves}} volunteers to help alleviate the problem.

25|$|The flying <b>boom</b> <b>is</b> a rigid, {{telescoping}} {{tube with}} movable {{flight control surfaces}} that a boom operator on the tanker aircraft extends and inserts into a receptacle on the receiving aircraft. All boom-equipped tankers (e.g. KC-135 Stratotanker, KC-10 Extender) have a single boom, and can refuel one aircraft at a time with this mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The Ramallah {{construction}} <b>boom</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the most}} obvious signs of West Bank economic growth, estimated {{at an annual rate of}} 8 percent. This has been attributed to relative stability and Western donor support to the Palestinian Authority. Ramallah's buoyant economy continues to draw Palestinians from other West Bank towns where jobs are fewer. The built-up area has grown fivefold since 2002.|$|E

25|$|As it {{has been}} since Aztec times, the state has been a {{favorite}} retreat for those in Mexico City, especially Cuernavaca, due to its warm year-round climate. This has been especially true since the latter 20th century and has spurred a major housing boom which continues to this day. Most of this <b>boom</b> <b>is</b> centered on the city of Cuernavaca but there it also affects Cuautla and some other places as well.|$|E
25|$|When {{a sailor}} falls and must recover to a sailing position, the <b>boom</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} used {{in one of}} the initial steps of performing a waterstart. When the sail is first lifted from the water, it often helps to push the back of the board slightly underwater, and then setting the front of the boom onto the board (near the footstraps). The buoyancy of the board will then push the boom upward, helping to lift the sail out of the water.|$|E

25|$|The Susquehanna <b>Boom</b> <b>was</b> {{a system}} of cribs in the West Branch Susquehanna River {{designed}} to hold timber in the river until it could be processed {{at one of the}} nearly 60 sawmills along the river between Lycoming and Loyalsock creeks in Lycoming County. The <b>boom</b> <b>was</b> constructed in 1846 under the supervision of James H. Perkins.|$|R
50|$|The 7-5's twin <b>booms</b> <b>were</b> {{attached}} to brackets {{on the rear}} corners of the centre-section; the <b>booms</b> <b>were</b> longer than on the 7-4, placing the elevator hinge about 1 m further behind the centre-section trailing edge. Curved, balanced control surfaces replaced the earlier unbalanced ones. Its elevator was elliptical in plan with the straight-edged tailplane projecting forward.|$|R
25|$|The {{frame of}} a <b>boom</b> <b>is</b> usually {{constructed}} from aluminum or carbon fiber. It usually has {{some type of}} padding on its main beams for comfort, and also to help protect itself, the board, and the sailor during falls. A boom can usually be adjusted in length to accommodate different sized sails. The front of the boom (where it attaches to the mast) is usually blunt-shaped, and constructed of a durable plastic. It may also have some padding or rubberized exterior, again to minimize damage in the event it strikes the board or rider during a fall.|$|E
25|$|On his {{paternal}} side, Cha's cousins include Cha Liang-chao (1897–1982), {{a famous}} educator and philanthropist, and Cha Liang-chien (查良鑑; 1904–1994), the Minister of Justice of Taiwan from 1967 to 1970. Distant paternal relatives of Cha include the Hong Kong entrepreneur Cha Chi-ming (1914–2007), the poet Zha Liangzheng (查良錚; 1918–1977), and the xiangsheng actor Zha Liangxie (查良燮; d. 2003). Zha Jiawen (查家雯) from the Taiwanese girl-band Cherry <b>Boom</b> <b>is</b> a paternal grand-niece of Cha. Cha is also distantly {{related to the}} Taiwanese romance novelist Chiung Yao (b. 1938); one of Cha's paternal cousins was a maternal aunt of Chiung Yao.|$|E
25|$|The AS332 Super Puma {{is powered}} by a pair of Turbomeca Makila 1A1 {{turboshaft}} engines which drive the rotorcraft's four-bladed main rotor and five-bladed tail rotor as well two separate hydraulic systems and a pair of electrical alternators. Fuel is housed in six internal fuel tanks, additional auxiliary and external tanks can be equipped for extended flight endurance. For safety, the fuel tanks use a crashworthy plumbing design and fire detection and suppression systems are installed in the engine bay. The monocoque tail <b>boom</b> <b>is</b> fitted with tail rotor strike protection, the forward portion of the boom accommodated a luggage compartment. The retractable tricycle landing gear is designed for high energy absorption qualities.|$|E
