5|$|Back at the office, {{the staff}} have drunk {{multiple}} cups of espresso and experience a caffeine rush {{along with a}} powerful surge in office productivity. As the rush dies down, they all begin to sweat profusely, become highly irritable and argumentative, frantically tear up the office carpet to reveal the hardwood underneath, and try to relocate the copy machine. At five o'clock everybody leaves the office in total disarray. When Pam and Darryl arrive back from Philadelphia, they are <b>bewildered</b> <b>by</b> the sight they encounter.|$|E
5|$|By resubmitting the discredited treaty {{through a}} House-sponsored bill, the Tyler {{administration}} reignited sectional hostilities over Texas admission. Both northern Democratic and southern Whig Congressmen had been <b>bewildered</b> <b>by</b> local political agitation {{in their home}} states during the 1844 presidential campaigns. Now, northern Democrats found themselves vulnerable to charges of appeasement of their southern wing if they capitulated to Tyler's slavery expansion provisions. On the other hand, Manifest Destiny enthusiasm in the north placed politicians under pressure to admit Texas immediately to the Union.|$|E
5|$|The {{recording}} is a freestyle dance-pop song {{in common}} {{time at a}} tempo of 112 beats per minute. In the lyrics, the singer is saddened and <b>bewildered</b> <b>by</b> the departure of her love interest. She tells him how much she {{is in love with}} him, and cannot live without him. The remix version featured on Enamorada de Ti (2012) is a merengue duet with Spanish singer Juan Magan.|$|E

5|$|Although Buffy and {{her friends}} deal with death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are <b>bewildered</b> <b>by</b> the natural death of Joyce Summers, the {{divorced}} mother of Buffy and her sister Dawn and occasionally a mother figure to their friends. They struggle to comprehend what the loss means {{to each of them}} and to the group. Buffy must begin to face her life and her duties as the Slayer without parental support and comfort. The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the Buffy series—and disorienting effects were included to convey the sense of displacement and loss associated with the death of a close family member.|$|E
5|$|Above all, {{he possessed}} a {{resolute}} decision of character, which, however unfortunately {{it may have}} operated under different conditions, appeared to extraordinary advantage at the crisis of continental thrones. <b>Bewildered</b> <b>by</b> the revolutionary din, and oscillating ignominiously between fear and rage, resistance and concession, the clique of crowned heads suffered greatly by contrast with a Sovereign who at least knew his own mind, and was prepared to abide by his opinions. In the European convulsions, therefore, King Ernest maintained the stability of his throne and the tranquillity of his people without damage from revolution or reaction. As Kings, indeed, are computed on the continent, he was an able and even a popular Monarch, and his memory may find, perhaps, in his ancestral dominions a sympathy which it would be vain to bespeak {{for it in the}} scenes of his manhood or the land of his birth.|$|E
5|$|Years later, {{six months}} after the Battle of New York, Stark's {{experiences}} during the alien invasion are giving him panic attacks. Restless, he has built several dozen Iron Man suits, creating friction with his girlfriend Pepper Potts. Meanwhile, a string of bombings by a terrorist known only as the Mandarin has left intelligence agencies <b>bewildered</b> <b>by</b> a lack of forensic evidence. Stark's security chief Happy Hogan is badly injured in a Mandarin attack, causing Stark to issue a televised threat to the Mandarin, who responds by destroying Stark's home with helicopter gunships. Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack along with Potts. Stark escapes in an Iron Man suit, which his artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's experimental armor lacks sufficient power to return to California, and the world believes him dead.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the first}} issue of ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine was published, the editors of the {{magazine}} have hosted reader participation games whose outcome is directly influenced by the people who read the magazine. Strawberry Panic!s origin was in the October 2003 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine where it was announced after the ending of Sakurako Kimino's previous work Sister Princess that a new reader participation project would start the following month. In the November 2003 issue, the first batch of characters from St. Miator were introduced (Nagisa, Shizuma, Tamao, and Chiyo) and it was revealed how readers could participate in the project. The initial system had the three main girls of Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna (given without surnames) who were sisters {{and at the same time}} younger sisters of the readers of the magazine, effectively putting the reader in the position of the elder brother. Each girl entered her respective school and became the main character of that school. It was explained that the coupling of the main characters could be to an upperclassman, a classmate, or an underclassman, but had to stay within the school they attended. For example, Nagisa, who attended Miator could not be coupled with another character from either Spica or Lulim at first. Playing the role of the elder brother, the reader gave advice to the younger sisters who were <b>bewildered</b> <b>by</b> their new lives at each of the schools. Thus, the readers had the ability to influence the coupling formations which would later be written by Kimino as short stories serialized in Dengeki G's Magazine.|$|E
25|$|Horney was <b>bewildered</b> <b>by</b> psychiatrists' {{tendency}} to place so {{much emphasis on}} the male sexual organ. Horney also reworked the Freudian Oedipal complex of the sexual elements, claiming that the clinging to one parent and jealousy of the other was simply the result of anxiety, caused by a disturbance in the parent-child relationship.|$|E
25|$|I am {{sure that}} she was {{frequently}} <b>bewildered</b> <b>by</b> the rapidity and mutability of her own impulses. Possessed, as she was, of an intuitive rather than an analytical intelligence, I doubt that she really understood herself clearly, any more than did {{most of those who}} thought they knew her intimately. An exception in this regard was Daphne du Maurier.|$|E

25|$|<b>Bewildered</b> <b>by</b> his callous {{indifference}} to their separation, Nina sublets their apartment, leaves their beloved cat behind and joins {{her husband in}} India. Upon her arrival he appears deeply unenthusiastic to be reunited and demonstrates neither affection nor sexual interest. A while later, Nina flies to a meeting in New York, where she receives a brief e-mail from her husband telling her that their relationship is over. Sad and alone, she stays in New York, finding comfort in a new cat and her study of the Ramayana.|$|E
25|$|In late 1968 Sun Ra and the Arkestra {{made their}} first {{tour of the}} US West Coast. Reactions were mixed. Hippies {{accustomed}} to long-form psychedelia like the Grateful Dead were often <b>bewildered</b> <b>by</b> the Arkestra. By this time, the performance included 20–30musicians, dancers, singers, fire-eaters, and elaborate lighting. John Burks of Rolling Stone wrote a positive review of a San Jose State College concert. Sun Ra was featured on the April 19, 1969 cover of the magazine, which introduced his inscrutable gaze to millions. During this tour, Damon Choice, then an art student at San Jose, joined the Arkestra and became its vibraphonist.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Urdu novels {{focused on}} urban social life, {{eventually}} widening in scope to include rural social life. They also covered the changing times under the progressive writing movement inspired by Sajjad Zaheer. However, {{the independence of}} Pakistan in 1947 greatly affected the novel, bringing up questions of identity and migration {{as can be seen}} in the major works of Abdullah Hussain and Quratulain Haider. Towards the end of the last century the novel took a serious turn towards the contemporary life and realities of the young generations of India. The most significant novels of the current generation of Indian novelists in Urdu, which demonstrate a new confidence in contemporary life, are Makaan by Paigham Afaqui, Do Gaz Zameen by Abdus Samad, and Pani by Ghazanfer. These works, especially Makaan, brought the Urdu novel out of the prevailing themes of the independence of Pakistan in 1947 and identity issues and took it into the realm of modern-day realities and issues of life in India. Makaan influenced many English writers such as Vikram Seth, who turned to novel writing. These Urdu novels further affected significant works such as Andhere Pag by Sarwat Khan, Numberdar Ka Neela by S M Ashraf and Fire Area by Ilyas Ahmed Gaddi. Paigham Afaqui's second major novel, Paleeta, was published in 2011 and depicts the tension of the political sickening of a common Indian citizen in the six decades after India's independence. <b>Bewildered</b> <b>by</b> the disappointing state of democracy and the transformation of Indian society into a mental desert the central character dies after leaving behind his writings which catch fire.|$|E

500|$|Shaw's {{first play}} of the decade was Too True to be Good, written in 1931 and premiered in Boston in February 1932. The {{reception}} was unenthusiastic. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times commenting that Shaw had [...] "yielded to the impulse to write without having a subject", judged the play a [...] "rambling and indifferently tedious conversation". The correspondent of The New York Herald Tribune said {{that most of the}} play was [...] "discourse, unbelievably long lectures" [...] and that although the audience enjoyed the play it was <b>bewildered</b> <b>by</b> it.|$|E
500|$|In {{later years}} I {{learned that he}} had always liked me and thought I was worth educating, {{and for that reason}} he made an effort on this trip to get to know me. He did it cleverly.

Largely because of Louis' early interpretation of the standards and ethics of the newspaper business, I came to look with interest and confidence on the writing fraternity ...

She is embarrassed and <b>bewildered</b> <b>by</b> {{what has happened to}} him and desperately wants her ordinary life back. The expression of his lost life is seen when he is sculpting a huge model of Devils Tower in his living room, with his family deserting him. Roy's obsession with an idea implanted by an alien intelligence, his construction of the model, and his gradual loss of contact with his wife, mimic the events in the short story [...] "Dulcie and Decorum" [...] (1955) by Damon Knight.|$|E

500|$|Pedro II was {{acclaimed}} {{as the new}} Brazilian Emperor on 9 April. <b>Bewildered</b> <b>by</b> his parents' abandonment {{and frightened}} by the large crowds and thundering artillery salutes, he wept inconsolably as he was taken, with Mariana de Verna at his side, by carriage up to the City Palace. The frightened young Emperor was displayed along with his sisters {{at one of the}} windows of the palace. He stood atop a chair so that he could be seen by the assembled thousands and observe their acclamations. The Brazilians were touched by this [...] "figure of a small orphan who would rule them one day." [...] The entire ordeal, followed by the roar of saluting cannon, was so traumatic to the little emperor that it may account for his noted aversion to ceremonies as an adult.|$|E
500|$|Selling the ZX81 {{over the}} counter was seen as {{something}} of a gamble and Rowland's colleagues were initially unenthusiastic about the scheme. Branch buyers thought that the ZX81 was unlikely to sell more than 10–15 units per branch at launch. Rowland himself thought that the ZX81 would sell about 10,000 units during the first five months of the retail agreement, equivalent to one month's mail order sales by Sinclair. In the event, the ZX81 was a massive success for Smith's, it went on sale for £99 making it the first home PC in the UK to retail for under £100. The [...] "Computer Know-How" [...] sections were swamped with eager customers, overwhelming the 300 staff who had been trained to demonstrate the machines; a Financial Times correspondent wrote of being [...] "dazed and <b>bewildered</b> <b>by</b> the crowds of schoolchildren clustered round the ZX81 in your local branch of W.H. Smith." [...] Within a year, Smith's had sold 350,000 ZX81s, making an estimated net profit of £10 million. Sales of peripherals, software, books and magazines netted even more profit.|$|E
500|$|Slay Tracks was {{recorded}} during a four-hour session on January 17, 1989, at Young's studio. Kannberg, describing {{the studio and}} the recording process, said, [...] "You go into his house and it's stuff everywhere, old dogs lying around, big pot plants everywhere, and Gary tells us that he got all his equipment by selling pot! It was us going in and pretty much just laying down the songs with a glide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and then we'd play drums over the top." [...] Young, though <b>bewildered</b> <b>by</b> the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He recalled, [...] " [...] {{come in and they}} play this weird guitar noise and it just sounds like noise, with no background. My drums were in there so I said, 'Should I drum?' and they said 'Okay.'" [...] Kannberg said, [...] "We did it really fast. We probably spent one day tracking and one day mixing it." [...] The title of the EP had been decided prior to its recording, and the pseudonyms S.M. and Spiral Stairs were used to credit Malkmus and Kannberg respectively.|$|E
