500|$|For {{several more}} days, Davis led {{relatively}} quiet patrols, until November 30, Davis' 22nd combat mission in Korea. Around 16:00, Davis' flight of eight F-86s spotted {{a large group}} of nine Tupolev Tu-2 bombers from the Chinese 8th Bomber Division, escorted by 16 Lavochkin La-11 fighters from the Chinese 2nd Fighter Division near Sahol along the Yalu River. The force was en route to a bombing mission on Taehwado Island in the Pansong archipelago. Davis maneuvered the patrol into position for a firing pass on the bombers. He completed four attack runs on the formation, being continuously attacked by the La-11 fighters, which were unable to hit his aircraft. In spite of being separated from his wingmen, he managed to destroy two of the bombers and cause the crew of a third to bail out. By this time, another group of F-86s arrived to continue the fight, as Davis' aircraft were low on ammunition and fuel. As the flight attempted to withdraw, one of Davis' pilots, Raymond O. Barton, called for help. Davis flew to Barton's aid and found Barton's damaged aircraft under attack from 24 MiG-15s of the Chinese 3rd Fighter Division arriving as reinforcement. As two MiG-15s prepared a final attack on Barton, Davis swooped through their pass and scored direct hits on one, killing the Chinese flight leader who commanded the MiG pack. The second broke off its attack. Davis then escorted Barton's damaged aircraft back to base, landing with only [...] of fuel left in his tanks. For the day's actions, Davis was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. The Taehwado bombing mission forced the Chinese Air Force to end all bombing missions {{for the rest of the}} war, while the [...] "hat-trick" [...] of downing four Chinese aircraft in the fight resulted in raising Davis' confirmed victory count in Korea to six, making him the fifth jet ace of the war and the first ace in the history of the US military to become an ace in two wars. At this point, Davis wrote to his family that he expected to <b>be</b> <b>home</b> <b>by</b> Christmas, but then the Air Force extended his tour of duty.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 June 2011, Obama {{addressed}} {{the nation from}} the White House and announced that 10,000 troops would be withdrawn {{by the end of}} 2011 and an additional 23,000 troops will leave the country by the summer of 2012. He said the drawdown would continue [...] "at a steady pace" [...] until the United States handed over security to the Afghan authorities in 2014. [...] "We are starting this drawdown from a position of strength," [...] Obama said. [...] "Al Qaeda is under more pressure {{than at any time since}} 9/11." [...] Asserting that the country that served as a base for 11 September 2001 attacks no longer represented a terrorist threat to the United States, Obama declared that the [...] "tide of war is receding." [...] The announced drawdown will leave approximately 68,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan by the autumn of 2012 according to The Huffington Post, but Gen. John R. Allen, commander of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), said that 23,000 of the 88,000 U.S. troops currently in Afghanistan will <b>be</b> <b>home</b> <b>by</b> 30 September 2012 and thus 65,000 U.S. troops will remain in Afghanistan after the so-called Phase 2 drawdown.|$|E
