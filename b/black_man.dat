5|$|The video {{begins with}} Madonna {{witnessing}} {{a young woman}} being robbed and murdered {{by a group of}} men, but she is too frozen in fear to protest. A <b>black</b> <b>man</b> walking down the alley also sees the incident and runs to help the woman, but the murderers flee just as the police arrive. The police mistakenly suspect the <b>black</b> <b>man</b> of being the killer and arrest him. The real murderers give a threatening look towards Madonna and leave. She flees the crime scene and escapes to a church. There she sees a caged statue of saint who resembles the <b>black</b> <b>man</b> on the street. As the song starts, she utters a prayer in front of the statue which appears to be crying.|$|E

Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs, he allowed Frederick Douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C. and appointed another <b>black</b> <b>man</b> (James Campbell Matthews, a former New York judge) to replace Douglass upon his resignation.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} mentorship in Black Greek letter fraternities (BGLFs) in resisting cultural and institutional oppression. Based on twenty interviews with black male college students, we build upon the works of others that have sought to examine the functions BGLFs play among <b>black</b> <b>men</b> in college. Through a grounded analysis of interviews and participant observation, we find that peer mentorships produce positive academic and social outcomes for <b>black</b> <b>men</b> in BGLFs. We suggest that BGLF participation offers collegiate <b>black</b> <b>men</b> mentorships with older members who motivate them to succeed personally and academically, support in integrating them into the black student community, and helps develop their professionalism and leadership.

5|$|Madonna {{lies down}} on a pew and has a dream in which she is falling through space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna {{to do what is}} right and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into the <b>black</b> <b>man</b> she had seen earlier. He kisses her forehead and leaves the church as she picks up a knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing wildly in front of burning crosses, erotic scenes between her and the saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that the <b>black</b> <b>man</b> is innocent; the police release him.

While {{researchers}} have explored factors of retention for <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> attending historically White institutions (HWIs), less research explains factors under-lying the success of <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> attending historically <b>Black</b> colleges and universities (HBCUs), particularly those men who are academically unprepared. Eleven <b>Black</b> <b>men,</b> who entered a public, urban HBCU through its pre-college program and persisted to graduation, provided a retrospective view of factors promoting their success.

A recent report from the American Council on Education (ACE, 2006) indicated an increase in the participation rates for African Americans in higher education.

Nine <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> were recruited via community centres in London, interviewed and the transcripts analysed employing Foucauldian discourse analysis.

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (MW)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The {{promotion}} of women's and children's rights excluded {{men from the}} process. The implementation of these rights called for a shift in domestic power relations. Men, especially certain <b>black</b> <b>men,</b> were plunged in predicament as some felt that the changes undermined their cultural and traditional masculine identities and that women and children abused their rights. In many cases the relationships between men, women and children came under pressure. This research is conducted among <b>black</b> <b>men.</b> The aim is to explore and describe black men's experience of their relationship with {{women and children in}} the context of women's and children's rights. An empirical study using a qualitative approach was followed to promote understanding of black men's experiences. In-depth interviews and personal notes/letters were used to collect data. The gist of the findings is that these changes are not important to women and children only, but to men too. The findings produced the following six main categories: <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> view women's and children's rights as good if correctly used; <b>black</b> <b>men</b> experience that women and children abuse their rights; <b>black</b> <b>men</b> feel that children do not honour them as they put their own rights above their father's rights; <b>black</b> <b>men</b> feel marginalised and use fight, flight or passiveness as coping strategies; <b>black</b> <b>men</b> experience women's and children's rights as a major cause of family disorganisation; <b>black</b> <b>men</b> suggest {{that there should be a}} platform for men and women to talk about their differences and types of power.

Once she was, Watros and her twin daughters immediately moved from Los Angeles to Hawaii. Bernard is also introduced in this episode. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and made Bernard white to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only <b>black</b> <b>man</b> in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L.

40|$|Racial {{disparities in}} {{policing}} and recent high-profile incidents {{resulting in the}} deaths of <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> have ignited a national debate on policing policies. Given evidence that both police officers and <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> may be associated with threat, we examined the impact of perceived threat on support for reformed policing policies. Across three studies we found correlational evidence that perceiving police officers as threatening predicts increased support for reformed policing practices (e. g., limiting the use of lethal force and matching police force demographics to those of the community). In contrast, perceiving <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> as threatening predicted reduced support for policing policy reform. Perceived threat also predicted willingness to sign a petition calling for police reform. Experimental evidence indicated that priming participants to associate <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> with threat could also reduce support for policing policy reform, and this effect was moderated by internal motivation to respond without prejudice. Priming participants to associate police officers with threat did not increase support for policing policy reform. Results indicate that resistance to policing policy reform is associated with perceiving <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> as threatening. Moreover, findings suggest that publicizing racially charged police encounters, which may conjure associations between <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> and threat, could reduce support for policing policy reform...|$|R

This population-based retrospective cohort study is the first UK-based investigation of whether access to diagnostic services underlies the association between race and prostate cancer.

Race and factors that may influence prostate cancer diagnosis were assessed by questionnaire and hospital records review. We found that <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> were diagnosed an average of 5. 1 years younger as compared with White men (P< 0. 001).
