25|$|Teebo (Voiced by Eric Peterson then James Cranna) - Wicket's {{best friend}} and the older child of Warok and Batcheela. Fascinated by tales of sorcery and magic becomes his Master Logray's Apprentice. He {{is a bit of}} a dreamer, and {{sometimes}} a little clumsy. Teebo often lacks discipline, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> he learns to master over time from Logray, and eventually becomes a respectful young Ewok. Has ochre fur and he wears a tan, baggy hood with a feather.|$|E
500|$|In early 2001, Spears {{said that}} she had plans to make her film debut. She and her team then created a concept for it, which was later {{developed}} by Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rimes. Spears commented that she [...] "talked to [...] and told her what I wanted the movie to be about and she elaborated on it. It was my little project. When you do a movie, I {{think you have to be}} really passionate about it. I was having a lot of offers, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> my heart was into." [...] A press conference was held during the Marché International du Disque et de l'Edition Musicale (MIDEM) in Cannes, France, on January 19, 2002, where Spears also premiered the film.|$|E
500|$|In early 2001, Spears and {{her team}} {{developed}} a script for a movie where the singer could be the main role. [...] "I talked to [...] and told her what I wanted the movie to be about and she elaborated on it," [...] Spears said. [...] "It was my little project. When you do a movie, I {{think you have to}} be really passionate about it. I was having a lot of offers, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> my heart was into." [...] After finishing the script, the movie, which was later titled Crossroads, had the working titles of What Are Friends For and Not a Girl. [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman", written by Dido, Max Martin and Rami, was originally intended to be included on the movie's soundtrack, but after JIVE Records decided not to release a soundtrack, Spears later decided to use it on her third studio album, Britney (2001).|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s Democratic {{candidates}} for governor won the county, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> of an anomaly. The last Democratic candidate for Governor {{to win the}} county was Booth Gardner in 1984.|$|R
5000|$|In the San-yūtei Enchō of {{classical}} rakugo, {{there was a}} programme titled [...] "Shinigami", <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that <b>was</b> not thought of independently in Japan, but rather from adaptions of the Italian opera the Crispino e la comare and the Grimm Fairy Tale [...] "Godfather Death".|$|R
2500|$|The Fabian Society {{considers}} the term to be offensive and regards it as [...] "sneering and patronising" [...] to a largely voiceless group. On describing {{those who use}} the word, the society stated that [...] "we all know their old serviette/napkin, lounge/living room, settee/sofa tricks. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> new. This is middle class hatred of the white working class, pure and simple." [...] The Fabian Society have been {{highly critical of the}} BBC in using the term in broadcasts. Use of the term 'chav' was reported in The Guardian in 2011 as [...] "class abuse by people asserting superiority".|$|E
2500|$|The group {{developed}} a reputation for exciting and polished live performances that enabled them to work even {{without the benefit of}} best-selling records. Choreographer Atkins designed [...] "fast-stepping" [...] dance routines that became a signature of the Pips' stage presentation; Atkins later described his working and personal relationship with the group in his autobiography, Class Act: The Jazz Life of Choreographer Cholly Atkins: [...] "The one thing that I was pleased about was a stipulation in my contract that allowed me to keep working with Gladys Knight & the Pips as personal clients even though I would be an employee of Motown Records. To tell the truth, Gordy wasn't too happy about it at first, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that I would not compromise under any circumstances. By that time, Gladys and the guys were like my own children!" [...] The group was a touring standout during this period with Knight's contralto lead vocals and the Pips' impeccable choreography and characteristic background vocals becoming highlights.|$|E
60|$|DOOLITTLE. I shouldn't mind if it {{had only}} {{happened}} to me: anything might happen to anybody and nobody to blame but Providence, as you might say. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that you done to me: yes, you, Henry Higgins.|$|E
60|$|The spurt of {{red blood}} brought a shrill cry of delight from Teeka. Ah, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> worth while! She glanced {{about to see}} if others had {{witnessed}} this evidence of her popularity. Helen of Troy was never one whit more proud than was Teeka at that moment.|$|R
60|$|Montgomery {{had become}} {{accustomed}} to the brutal frankness of the Northern worker. At first it had enraged him, but after a time he had grown callous to it, and accepted it as it <b>was</b> meant. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> different. It <b>was</b> insolence--brutal, overbearing insolence, with physical menace behind it.|$|R
2500|$|The {{reason for}} [...] {{was that there}} was no visual {{material}} [...] that was out there really. The studio albums had been put out in many different shapes and forms, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that <b>was</b> sorely missing because [...] Zeppelin built its material on live performances. So that had to be done.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is well I do know it. I {{thought it}} {{unsatisfactory}} {{to hear of}} no profit, after all the talk there has been about his books. I feared it was an empty trade: <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> like. Five thousand! He is a clever fellow after all!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Laura! You {{ought to}} know me better than that," [...] he {{answered}} somewhat shortly. [...] "I never run any bills unless I am able to pay them. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> different. It {{is in the same}} line with the one I got from Mr. Wecks. I didn't get his shoes, and I haven't gotten anything from Mr. Dickley for a long time, and nothing at all that I haven't paid for." ...|$|E
50|$|The KDE-Edu {{project is}} {{available}} for Unix, BSD and Linux, currently {{can be used in}} Microsoft Windows, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that is in beta.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course a}} young lady will stand up for her lover, but you will really have to drop him. I'm not a hard sort of man, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that the world will not stand. When he thought {{the man had been}} murdered he didn't say {{anything}} about it for fear they should tax him with it. And then he swore he had never seen him. It <b>was</b> <b>something</b> of that sort." ...|$|R
5000|$|A clubman version, the Rocket Gold Star, was {{produced}} with rearsets (i.e. footrests moved rearward {{from the standard}} position to cause the rider to lean further forward into a more aerodynamic posture), clip-on handlebars and a tuned engine, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> of a special and {{was produced}} from 1961-1963 based on modifications to the Super Rocket by Eddie Dow {{at the same time}} as the [...] "Big Valve" [...] Super Rocket.|$|R
5000|$|Though well-received with Love's fans, Tim Teeman of The Times criticised the documentary's {{content and}} director, noting that it [...] "wasn't painful viewing {{for the reasons}} its subject {{intended}} ... but for the cowed awe of Will Yapp, the film's writer, director and producer. It's one thing to ingratiate oneself with a subject to elicit their secrets, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> else. Yapp {{seemed to want to}} be Love's friend, not her inquisitor." ...|$|R
5000|$|The core of The Electones is Jens Petter Nilsen and Hallvard Wennersberg Hagen. You {{may know}} them as Xploding Plastix, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> quite different. Following {{the release of}} two 12"-ers as The Electones on the UK label Inertia in 2002 and 2003, they {{received}} {{their fair share of}} nice reviews: ...|$|E
5000|$|It {{is hardly}} {{necessary}} to record that both Learning {{and the military}} arts are the Way of the Warrior, for it is an ancient law that one should have Learning {{on the left and}} the martial arts on the right. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that will not be obtainable if one has not prepared for it beforehand." ...|$|E
5000|$|Insulting Kevin Federline {{appearing}} {{in a video}} where he displays his new song - [...] "I gotta say like, I.. I respect artists, don't get me wrong, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> anybody could whip up in 10 minutes with GarageBand. And watch as the moron at the mixing board, like just loved his pathetic little track. Yeah, exactly." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bret Harte and Clemens had by {{this time}} quit the Californian, [...] expecting to {{contribute}} to Eastern periodicals. Clemens, however, [...] was not yet through with Coast journalism. There was much interest [...] just {{at this time in}} the Sandwich Islands, and he was selected by [...] the foremost Sacramento paper to spy out the islands and report [...] aspects and conditions there. His letters home were still [...] infrequent, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> worth writing.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, really, Ginger, I {{know you}} would do {{anything}} you could, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> just <b>something</b> I must worry through by myself. When do you go down to this place?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Kummer's {{profile of}} Courtney Love, in particular, struck Hoetzel as too outlandish to be true. [...] "That {{did it for}} me. We all know Courtney Love <b>is</b> far out, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> else. <b>This</b> woman has <b>been</b> so {{controlling}} about all press and all interviews were conducted under extremely restrictive circumstances. And yet this guy seemed to have this incredible access." [...] Hoetzel translated Kummer's profile of Love {{and sent it to}} her publicist, which began the cascade of denials from publicists who insisted their clients had never even met Kummer.|$|R
5000|$|... "We are all mystified - {{that is to}} say, fooled, duped, {{treated as}} of no account. I {{had the good fortune}} to have been taught to see through the {{trickery}} in my youth. In La Regle du Jeu, I passed on what I knew to the public. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that people do not like; the truth makes them feel uncomfortable."— Jean Renoir, from his autobiography ...|$|E

5000|$|From a young age, Stirling had {{a fascination}} for dance, and desired to take both dancing and violin lessons. In an {{interview}} with NewMediaRockstars, she said, [...] "...ever since I was a kid, I've always wished that I could dance, but my parents said, 'You can choose violin or you can choose dance, but we can't afford both', and I chose violin. So {{this is kind of}} a fulfillment - it's funny to say, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> I've always wanted to do." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{metabolic}} rift captures [...] "the material estrangement {{of human beings}} within capitalist society from the natural conditions which {{formed the basis for}} their existence." [...] However, Marx also emphasizes the importance of historical change. It was both necessary and possible to rationally govern human metabolism with nature, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> [...] "completely beyond the capabilities of bourgeois society." [...] In a future society of freely associated producers, however, humans could govern their relations with nature via collective control, rather than through the blind power of market relations. In Capital, volume 3, Marx states: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not asking}} it of the BANK," [...] said Barker, with a smile, [...] "for I {{could have gone}} to the bank for it. <b>But</b> as <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> between us, I am asking you, Stacy, as my old partner." ...|$|R
50|$|In the spring, {{the twelve}} {{brothers}} arrived at Uppsala and Hjorvard asked for Ingeborg's hand, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> Hjalmar would not tolerate. Hjalmar stepped forth {{and said that}} he deserved the princess more than a strange berserker. The king who was uncomfortable with having twelve infamous berserkers in his hall declared that he could not possibly choose between two so great men, and thus he preferred to let Ingeborg make the choice herself. Naturally, Ingeborg chose Hjalmar and this vexed Hjorvard who challenged the happy Hjalmar to a duel on Samsø, and reminded that Hjalmar would be niðingr, if he did not turn up.|$|R
5000|$|While {{playing for}} Alfreton Town in 2011 Arnold took a barbering course. Within months of playing {{full-time}} football with Grimsby Town in 2014, {{he started a}} barber career and works in a hairdressers based in Grimsby, he also runs his own mobile barber business. [...] "Football always comes first, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> I can fall back on as I get older and it's something I really enjoy doing." [...] Nathan Arnold, speaking to the Grimsby Telegraph in November 2014.|$|E
50|$|The principal's elder 18-year-old twin daughter; Yi Zhen (recognised by {{her long}} hair) {{is the more}} extroverted sister and stands up for herself {{as well as her}} sister, taking {{injustice}} personally. Yi Zhen has a phobia of water which stems from her memories of her throwing her sister (and consequently falling in herself) into a swimming pool when they were 6. She hangs out after class with Jia Wei. She wants to appear perfect to everyone, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> only her sister knows.|$|E
5000|$|Hirsch opposed Measure B, a {{law passed}} in Los Angeles County on November 5, 2012 that {{requires}} all performers in adult films to wear condoms when filming sex scenes. Hirsch expressed {{confidence that the}} law, which was passed by 56 percent of voters, would be overturned {{on the grounds that}} it violates filmmakers' First Amendment rights, but stated that failing this, Vivid would move production out of Los Angeles County to survive, commenting, [...] "There have been obscenity prosecutions, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> on a whole different level." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There you are! You've hit {{it first}} barrel. It {{seems to me}} that there's no other {{explanation}} which will cover the facts. At some period in his life the little Doctor has gone astray. Humanum est errare. I have even done it myself. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> serious, and the other man got a hold of it and has never let go. That's the truth. Blackmail is at the bottom of it. But he had no hold over me, and there was no reason why I should stand his insolence, so I came away--and I very much expect to see you do the same." ...|$|R
5000|$|Zola's {{preference}} {{to use of}} metals in her architectural designs is explained by her as: [...] "Our buildings are made of metal <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not <b>something</b> that many people would think about; metals are the real building blocks of architecture".|$|R
5000|$|Jaron told Technorati {{that the}} song [...] "wasn't started or pushed by some major label or organization. I {{would love to}} take the credit for its success, <b>but</b> {{honestly}} <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> fans want {{and they are the}} ones calling radio to have them play it." ...|$|R
