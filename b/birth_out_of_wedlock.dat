Father Brinkley's first marriage was annulled because he was underage. After he reached adulthood, he married four more times, and outlived each of his young wives. In 1870, at the age of 42, he married Sarah T. Mingus. Later, the 24-year-old niece of Mingus moved into the house: Sarah Candice Burnett. The family called Brinkley's wife [...] "Sally" [...] to differentiate between the two Sarahs. Sarah Burnett gave <b>birth</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>wedlock</b> to John Romulus Brinkley in the town of Beta, in Jackson County, North Carolina, naming her son after his father, and after Romulus, the mythical twin suckled by wolves. Sarah Burnett died of pneumonia and tuberculosis when Brinkley was five. Sarah T.

John Richard Brinkley died when his son was ten years old. Young Brinkley attended a one-room log cabin school in the Tuckasegee area, held each year during three or four months of winter. There, Brinkley met Sally Margaret Wike, the daughter of a well-off school board member. When Brinkley was 13, the school term was lengthened, and a better teacher engaged.

40|$|Demographic {{change has}} affected, and {{continues}} to affect, all age groups and generations, {{as well as their}} interdependencies and mutual relationships. The long term, sweeping demographic trend in Europe and {{in other parts of the}} world is population ageing. As pointed out in a Green Paper by the European Commission, population ageing calls for new and enhanced forms of solidarity between the generations (European Commission 2005). This need for solidarity does not only apply to the needs of the elderly and of young, dependent children; the needs for solidarity is also felt by adults who, for example, try to combine paid work with family roles. At the same time, there are a number of socio-demographic trends that are often perceived as posing a potential threat to intergenerational solidarity (Daatland, Slagsvold & Lima 2009). These trends include increasing divorce rates, rising unmarried cohabitation, and a growing number <b>of</b> <b>births</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>wedlock.</b> Within the theoretical framework of the so-called Second Demographic Transition, these trends are interpreted to reflect growing individualism, as opposed to the familialistic altruism supposedly driving the so-called First Demographic Transition (Lesthaeghe 1995; van de Kaa 1987; 2003).

On the one hand, changes in the family are not regressing, marking the decline in the traditional pattern of two parents and one breadwinner. On the other hand, there has been a wide variety of changes in the behaviour of young people. Some indicators show more or less continuous improvement in the welfare of young people (proportion with secondary school qualifications) while others show a deterioration now curbed (access to higher education, alcohol and drug consumption, etc.) while yet others are a sign of continuous deterioration (murder, suicide, illegitimate births). The latter are thus the only ones that could demonstrate a correlation with family transformations. But one should be careful even in such cases since women are less affected than men and the situation of blacks and whites sometimes moves in opposite directions. Overall, the general idea of the harmful effects of changes in the family on the welfare of children should be treated with the strongest reservations...|$|R
