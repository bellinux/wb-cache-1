50|$|<b>Buff</b> <b>weka</b> {{are also}} present on Pig Island, having been {{transferred}} there from Stevensons Island in Lake Wanaka in 2006.|$|E
50|$|<b>Buff</b> <b>weka</b> were {{introduced}} to Stevensons Island in 2002 from the Chatham Islands.In 2009 they were removed due to a rabbit outbreak that attracted predators which killed four birds. They were then reintroduced in 2013.|$|E
50|$|Native New Zealand {{birds that}} can be found on Pigeon Island are: tui, wood pigeon, bellbird, brown creeper and yellow-crowned parakeet. <b>Buff</b> <b>weka</b> were {{translocated}} from Stevensons Island in 2006 and are now commonly seen.|$|E
50|$|<b>Buff</b> <b>weka</b> can {{be found}} on the island and are predators of much of the native {{wildlife}} including mountain stone weta, cave weta, and Southern Alps geckos. For this reason students of the local Mount Aspiring College built 40 small wooden motels for these animals to safely live in.|$|E
50|$|In 1962, {{the centre}} was {{established}} to breed and release endangered native birds on these 55 hectares. Takahe (a very rare bird, thought extinct, but rediscovered in Fiordland) were the first species introduced. In the same decade, {{a large number of}} brown teal, <b>buff</b> <b>weka</b> and kākāriki were released.|$|E
50|$|Numerous small islands (notably Ruby Island, Stevensons Island and Harwich Island) are to {{be found}} at the {{southern}} end of the lake, with some now serving as ecological sanctuaries, for example for <b>buff</b> <b>weka</b> in case of Stevensons Island. The only flat land around the lake is also to be found here, surrounding the outflow into the Clutha River. The towns of Wanaka and Albert Town are situated here.|$|E
50|$|The Wakatipu Islands Reforestation Trust {{was set up}} in 1999 to replant native {{trees on}} the Lake Wakatipu Islands concentrating on Pigeon Island mainly. Many volunteers have made the trip to the island since this time to replant trees such as rimu, kahikatea and beech. The aim is to restore the islands to their natural state without {{introduced}} predators such as stoats and rats, including the reintroduction of bird and insects, the most successful so far being the <b>buff</b> <b>weka</b> translocation programme.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>buff</b> <b>weka</b> (Gallirallus australis hectori) {{formerly}} {{inhabited the}} eastern districts of the South Island {{but is now}} confined to Chatham Island and Pitt Island to which it {{was introduced in the}} early 1900s, and where they are widely hunted and eaten, being considered 'introduced'. Reintroduction into Canterbury has been unsuccessful so far but introductions to Mao Waho Island (in Lake Wanaka in 2004) and from there to Pigeon and Pig Island (in Lake Wakatipu in 2005/2006) have been much more successful. It has a lighter overall colouring than the other subspecies. The North Island weka (Gallirallus australis greyi) [...] is represented by original populations in Northland and Poverty Bay, and by liberations elsewhere from that stock. This subspecies differs in its greyer underparts, and brown rather than reddish coloured legs.|$|E
