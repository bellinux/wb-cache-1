He angrily {{declares}} that her absence is to blame for the current state of his life, declaring that he is the reason Phil has left due to his homosexuality, but Kathy tells him that she and Phil knew that he was gay before he even started school, and that they have always loved him. Ian later decides to rebuild his relationship with his mother and allows Kathy to move into his house. Gavin meets Kathy in Walford and reveals that he has kidnapped Phil and threatens to kill him if she does not follow his instructions and give him money. Kathy and Ben reluctantly agree to give into Gavin's demands, but after trying to steal Ian's safe, Kathy decides not to do so. Ian later tells Kathy that her grandson Bobby Beale (Elliot Carrington) killed Lucy. Kathy, after seeing Ben drunk and angry at her, confesses to Ian that she is still on the run and she and Ben were planning to con him as Gavin has kidnapped Phil, so Ian throws her out, thinking she cares more about Phil than him. Jane is horrified that he told Kathy about Bobby, but Ian is confident she will not say anything to the police. Kathy then goes to the police station to report the kidnapping, while Ben tells Ian what Gavin has done. Ian contacts Gavin, telling him he knows what he has <b>been</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>It</b> is subsequently revealed that he has been keeping Phil locked in his closet, but by the time Kathy and the police come to his house looking for him, he is not there although a fresh blood stain is found in the kitchen. Kathy later tells the Beales what she has done, and Sharon is incensed when she finds out the truth, insisting none of it would have happened if Kathy had not returned. Phil returns home severely injured and Ian allows Kathy to move back into his house. Gavin later holds Kathy, Ben and Phil hostage in their house and when Sharon confronts him, he reveals himself as her father before fleeing. Kathy is given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to fraud.|$|E

She explained that the cast had to learn all of the ballroom dances from scratch and they spent a week going over them {{to make sure they}} were right. She explained, [...] "But what happens is as soon as you put the dialogue in, the dancing just goes to pot! So it's all about putting the movement and the dialogue together and remembering what your character is supposed to be thinking at the same time – that's quite tricky!" [...] Jones praised Mythen and said the teacher often reminded the actors to relax into the dance and remember that their character would have <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> for years, as they would have learnt at an early age.

500|$|Construction of the {{monument}} began in 1848 with the excavation of the site, the laying of the cornerstone on the prepared bed, and laying the original foundation around {{and on top of}} the cornerstone, before the construction of its massive walls began the next year. Even though slave labor is not mentioned, no paid laborers whatsoever are listed among the small paid labor force of 21 used to construct the foundation in 1848, which included 14 stonemasons and 2 stonecutters. In contrast, the maximum work force during the second phase was 170, including 100 stonecutters, with laborers second in number. Washington Monument Historian John Steele Gordon stated [...] "I can’t say for certain, but the stonemasonry was pretty highly skilled, so it’s unlikely that slaves would’ve <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> The stones were cut by stonecutters, which is highly skilled work; and the stones were hoisted by means of steam engines, so you’d need a skilled engineer and foreman for stuff like that. Tending the steam engine, building the cast-iron staircase inside — that wasn’t grunt work." [...] According to historian Jesse Holland, it is very likely that African-American slaves were among the construction workers, given that slavery prevailed in Washington and its surrounding states at that time, and slaves were commonly used in public and private construction.|$|E
500|$|Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime: Nimoy reprises {{the role}} of the older Spock from the {{original}} Star Trek timeline, credited as [...] "Spock Prime". He was a longtime friend of Abrams' parents, but became better acquainted with Abrams during filming. Although Quinto watched some episodes of the show during breaks in filming, Nimoy was his main resource in playing Spock. Abrams and the writers met Nimoy at his house; writer Roberto Orci recalled that the actor gave a Who are you guys and what are you up to?' vibe" [...] before being told how important he was to them. He was silent, and Nimoy's wife Susan Bay told the creative team he had remained in his chair after their conversation, emotionally overwhelmed by his decision after turning down many opportunities to revisit the role. Had Nimoy disliked the script, production would have been delayed for it to be rewritten. Nimoy later said, [...] "This is the first and only time I ever had a filmmaker say, 'We cannot make this film without you and we won't make it without you'". He was [...] "genuinely excited" [...] by the script's scope and its detailing of the characters' backstories, saying, [...] "We have dealt with , but never with quite the overview that this script has of the entire history of the character, the growth of the character, the beginnings of the character and the arrival of the character into the Enterprise crew."

500|$|Erica Hahn was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} minor character, and occasional guest-star rival of Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). The character first appeared in three episodes of the show's second season, followed by another two episodes of the show's third season. Discussing whether she thought Hahn might become a main character after her season three appearance, Smith has stated that at the time: [...] "I didn't really {{think it was going}} to work out", joking that [...] "After every time I would hope that they would call and also hope not too– kind of like when I used to be single." [...] However, following Washington's departure from the show, Hahn was brought back as a main character in the show's fourth season, replacing Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Smith has said that she was not expecting her character to be introduced to the show full-time, as she [...] "didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't happen." [...] She has stated that a deciding factor in her return was the opportunity it presented to explore the character in greater depth, explaining: [...] "When I work on something that has a beginning, middle and end, I can create an arc. With Dr. Hahn, I need to figure out who she is". Researching the role, Smith watched a heart surgery performed, and liaised with the surgical nurses employed by Grey's Anatomy producers to maintain realism in the show's operating room. She dubbed this research stressful, stating that [...] "I got very neurotic about the fact that I didn’t go to medical school. I’m not actually a doctor", explaining; [...] "I {{have no idea what it}} really is to be a surgeon and yet I have to act like I am really good at it. I have to look like I’ve <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> a long time".|$|E

500|$|De Boer {{felt that}} the {{producers}} {{did a good job}} with involving Ezri {{over the course of the}} seventh season, but not to the extent that it detracted from the more established members of the main cast. However, there was one part of the season where she was concerned that the fans would suffer from [...] "Ezri overload". But she {{felt that the}} character had a real story arc and character evolution as the season went by. She said that she did not want Ezri to remain the same [...] "young and confused" [...] person that she was in her first appearances, which was something that the writers and producers agreed with. She said that [...] "As time went on, you saw that Ezri was intelligent, that she was endearing and a good person. She became a more complicated character than you might have thought in her first few episodes." [...] She praised specific episodes which evolved the character, such as [...] "The Siege of AR-558" [...] which required Ezri to draw upon Dax's past experiences, as otherwise she would have been completely out of her element. De Boer also enjoyed [...] "" [...] as the episode showed the change in Ezri from before she was joined with the Dax symbiont, and she thought that the events portrayed in [...] "" [...] were [...] "fascinating". As she approached the end of Deep Space Nine, de Boer addressed the rumors of her joining , saying that [...] "My first instinct would be to say no. I would need to feel there was a reason for Ezri to be on Voyager". She was interviewed at the series wrap party after completing filming on the final episode, [...] "What You Leave Behind", and said, [...] "The last episode was very emotional, especially on the last day... I couldn't believe that a season had gone by already. I realized all the people I'd grown close to must be feeling it much more because they'd <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> 7 years.

500|$|Davies had {{suspected}} that Renwick {{would one day}} revive Jonathan Creek, explaining that Jonathan's fate had been left open, unlike Renwick's other famous character - One Foot In The Graves Victor Meldrew, {{who was killed in}} a hit and run in the show's last episode. When the production of [...] "The Grinning Man" [...] was announced in June 2008, Davies commented: [...] "For the last five years whenever I've passed a locked room I've thought there might be a mystery lurking behind it, so I'm very happy to return to Jonathan Creek and to have something to actually solve." [...] He stated that reprising the role after such a lengthy hiatus was initially strange, and that: [...] "I couldn't remember my lines on the first day. I'd sort of forgotten how precise you have to be when you work on a Jonathan Creek episode." [...] He praised co-star Sheridan Smith in comparison, describing how: [...] "Sheridan is extremely good at all that stuff, which works in a similar way to the script, in that she's a very bright, sharp character and Creek's a bit rusty and hasn't really <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> for a while. So sure enough, on the first day, she knows all her lines and makes her mark. And I'm going, 'Hang on a minute, stop showing off'". Upon receiving the episode's script, Davies had gained a stone in weight since last playing Jonathan Creek, almost five years previously. Renwick suggested that they include Davies' weight gain in the plot, presenting the character as having [...] "gone to seed". Davies, however, did not want to play a [...] "fat Creek", and lost weight before filming began, stating: [...] "it was my choice not to let him go too much". The actor discussed with Renwick how Jonathan may have developed in the intervening five years: [...] "We talked about whether he’d have changed, whether he’d have done any investigating in the meantime. He probably didn’t. He still does the same job and is locked in the same relationship with Klaus and feeling a bit put upon – that hasn’t changed at all... and he still lives in a windmill". In a change from the original, Cobstone Windmill was used for the exterior shots, replacing Shipley Windmill, which had been used for all other episodes. Davies grew his hair out again for the role, and wore his own duffel coat throughout the episode. The coat had become the character's trademark in the show's first series, with Davies explaining that: [...] "After we did the first series, I could never wear it off screen again, because people started doing the Danse Macabre [...] music everywhere I went. So it's just been in the wardrobe for 12 years." ...|$|E
