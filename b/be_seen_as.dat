5|$|Mirrors reflect Marion as she packs, {{her eyes}} as she checks the {{rear-view}} mirror, her face in the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.|$|E

5|$|Peada's {{conversion}} {{and the introduction}} of priests into Middle Anglia could <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> evidence of Penda's tolerance of Christianity, given the absence of evidence that he sought to interfere. On the other hand, an interpretation is also possible whereby the marriage and conversion could <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> corresponding to a successful attempt on Oswiu's part to expand Bernician influence at Penda's expense; Higham saw Peada's conversion more in terms of political manoeuvring on both sides than religious zeal.|$|E

5|$|Although {{conclusive}} evidence might be wanting either way for whether Hebrew Law allowed for impalement, or just hanging, the Neo-Assyrian method of impalement {{as seen in}} the carvings could, perhaps, equally easily <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a form of hanging upon a pole, rather than focusing upon the stake's actual penetration of the body.|$|E
