2500|$|A single unfluted tablet {{or part of}} a tablet, {{cut into}} pieces and {{assembled}} into a snuff box, 71 × 46–47 × 26–28mm. It is variously said to be made from foreign driftwood or Pacific rosewood. The glyphs that remain, though crudely carved with a steel blade, are in excellent condition, except {{in the center of}} the <b>bottom</b> <b>piece</b> where they have been worn down. There are no glyphs on the inside, as the tablet was planed down to a thickness 4–5mm before being cut into pieces (Fischer 1997:497).|$|E
2500|$|In modern times, {{when there}} is no paschal lamb, some Ashkenazi Jews have adopted the {{practice}} of emulating Hillel's example by making a sandwich of matzo and maror (the [...] "bitter herbs": either lettuce, endive, or horseradish). The maror, if lettuce or endive, is dipped in the meal's traditional charoset (a finely chopped sweet mixture of fruits and nuts, typically apples, walnuts, red wine, cinnamon, and honey) just before the sandwich is made. [...] In Ashkenazi families where grated horseradish is used for the maror instead of lettuce or endive, the maror cannot be dipped in the charoset, so it is the custom to spread the <b>bottom</b> <b>piece</b> of matzah with horseradish maror, cover it with a pile of charoset, and top it with another piece of matzah to make a hot-sweet sandwich.|$|E
50|$|A wrap is a {{variation}} of a sandwich: a sandwich has two distinct layers which are the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>pieces</b> of bread. A wrap, on the other hand, is one piece that completely surrounds {{the content of the}} wrap.|$|R

2500|$|Bikini Science {{identifies}} 30 {{different types}} of bikini bottoms that vary in style, cut {{and the amount of}} rear coverage they offer. The coverage ranges from full, {{as in the case of}} more modest <b>bottom</b> <b>pieces</b> like briefs, shorts, or briefs with a small skirt-panel attached, to [...] full butt exposure, as in the case of the thong bikini. Skimpier styles have narrow sides, including V-cut (in front), French cut (with high-cut sides) and low-cut string (with string sides).|$|R
60|$|While {{the front}} {{part of the}} lime which you saw here was so highly ignited, I could at any moment touch {{the back of it}} without feeling any {{annoyance}} from the heat So, by having a chamber of lime of this sort, he is able to get a vessel to contain these metals with scarcely any loss of heat. He puts the blowpipes through these apertures, and sends down these gases upon the metals, which are gradually melted. He then puts in more metal through a hole at the top. The results of the combustion issue out of the aperture which you see represented. If there be strips of platinum, he pushes them through the mouth out of which the heated current is coming, and there they get red-hot and white-hot before they get into the bath of platinum. So he is able to fuse a large body of platinum in this manner. When the platinum is melted, he takes off the top and pours out from the <b>bottom</b> <b>piece,</b> like a crucible, and makes his cast. This is the furnace by which he fuses his forty pounds or fifty pounds of platinum at once. The metal is raised to a heat that no eye can bear. There is no light and shadow, no chiaro-oscuro there; all is the same intensity of glow. You look in, and you cannot see where the metal or the lime is; it is all as one. We have, therefore, a platform with a handle, which turns upon an axis, that coincides with the gutter that is formed for the pouring of the metal; and when all is known to be ready, by means of dark glasses, the workmen take off the top piece and lift up the handle, and the mould being then placed in a proper position, he knows that the issue of the metal will be exactly in the line of the axis. No injury has ever happened from the use of this plan. You know with what care it is necessary to carry such a vessel of mercury as we have here, for fear of turning it over on one side or the other; but if it be a vessel of melted platinum, the very greatest care must be used, because the substance is twice as heavy: yet no injury has been done to any of the workmen in this operation.|$|E
50|$|The {{balancing}} perch pole {{consists of}} a tall steel pole (about 25 feet high and weighing about 50 pounds) with interchangeable top and bottom pieces, which are designed for variations of the act. The standard <b>bottom</b> <b>piece</b> is designed {{for a person to}} balance the pole on his shoulders and contains grips for holding the pole with his hands, while a substitute <b>bottom</b> <b>piece</b> may be used for a performer who wishes to balance the pole on his head.|$|E

5000|$|Each of {{the twelve}} panels {{comprises}} six joined pieces of paper, but the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>pieces</b> are half the usual size. Some aspects of the screens suggest the screen may be a preparatory work: unusually, the sizes of paper used in each screen are slightly different, and the joins between the sheets are not completely regular; and the seals for the artists names [...] "Hasegawa" [...] and [...] "Tōhaku" [...] do not use the usual forms. The trees {{on the far right}} of the right panel are cropped, suggesting that the order of the panels may have been altered or that some may have been replaced.|$|R

5000|$|This {{game has}} been {{analyzed}} by P. Straffin, who {{showed that it}} is a draw so long as both players can see 2-ply ahead, i.e. see the results of their move and of what their opponent would do in response. In particular, any win in Pong Hau K'i must go through the position shown on the left (or a symmetrically equivalent position). In this position, with Red to move, they have two choices: (1) They can move their top piece West along the top edge; or (2) They can move their <b>bottom</b> <b>piece</b> North along the left edge. In case (1), the game continues. But in case (2), the game will almost surely end quickly. If Blue then moves their <b>bottom</b> <b>piece</b> to the left, they win. If they are foolish enough to move their center piece instead, then Red wins by moving their top-right piece to the center. Thus with [...] "2-ply lookahead", player Red can see the result of their (bad) move of the <b>bottom</b> <b>piece</b> (the first ply), realize that Blue then has a winning move (the second ply), and hence Red will choose to not make that move.|$|E
50|$|Wooden drawers {{are often}} {{designed}} so that the front face is complete and the end grain from the side pieces does not show. The corners may be dovetailed for additional strength or for aesthetics, and a half-blind dovetail joint {{may be used for}} the front corners to hide the joint. To attach the <b>bottom</b> <b>piece</b> of the drawer, a groove may be cut in the four vertical pieces to insert the bottom of the drawer.|$|E

50|$|Rolled pleats create tubular pleats which run {{the length}} of the fabric from top to <b>bottom.</b> A <b>piece</b> of the fabric to be pleated is pinched and then rolled until it is flat against the rest of the fabric, forming a tube. A {{variation}} on the rolled pleat is the stacked pleat, which is rolled similarly and requires at least five inches of fabric per finished pleat. Both types of pleating create a bulky seam.|$|R

Taking his knife from his pocket, he cut off an inch from {{the lower end of}} the stick, and then shook out on to the table a number of slips of paper tightly rolled together.|$|R
50|$|The Large Glass {{consists}} of two glass panels, suspended vertically and measuring 109.25 x 69.25 in. The entire composition is shattered, but it rests sandwiched between two pieces of glass, set in a metal frame with a wooden base. The top rectangle of glass {{is known as the}} Bride's Domain; the <b>bottom</b> <b>piece</b> is the Bachelors' Apparatus.

5000|$|The case {{is usually}} {{constructed}} of hardcover or wood, {{and has a}} hinged lid connected to its base. Both lid and bottom sections of the box have three fixed side sections or [...] "lips"; the lid is slightly larger so that the side pieces [...] "nest" [...] when the case is closed. The fourth [...] "spine" [...] side has flexible joints where it joins the main top and <b>bottom</b> <b>pieces</b> and so goes flat onto the surface where the box is opened. The front-edge of the case often contains a clasp for closure. The exterior is covered with heavy paper, fabric or leather, and its interior may be lined with padded paper or felt, especially if made for a book. All materials should be acid-free for conservation. The depth of the box is normally about five inches, {{if it is not}} made for a specific object, and various standard sizes are made, with traditional names including [...] "royal", [...] "imperial", [...] "elephant" [...] and others. Ones for very old books will typically be custom made to an exact size. The boxes are stored flat, and are strong enough to be kept in small stacks.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two classes}} of pieces: men and kings. Men are single pieces. Kings consist of two men of the same colour, stacked {{one on top of}} the other. The <b>bottom</b> <b>piece</b> is {{referred}} to as crowned (or kinged in the U.S.). Some sets have pieces with a crown molded, engraved or painted on one side, allowing the player to simply turn the piece over or to place the crown-side up on the crowned man, further differentiating kings from men. Pieces are often manufactured with indentations to aid stacking.|$|E

[...] (The <b>bottom</b> <b>piece</b> of bread is the background to the first problem, the second piece of bread is both the historical solution to the first problem and the background to the second problem, and the third piece of bread is the historical solution to the second problem.) Similarly, a decision-forcing case for which the historical solution is not provided (and is thus a case with but one narrative element) is an [...] "open-face" [...] or [...] "smørrebrød" [...] case.|$|E
5000|$|Channel {{trucks are}} common on mountainboards, and {{are made up}} of an axles mounted to the truck <b>bottom</b> <b>piece,</b> which is {{suspended}} from a top hanger by a kingpin. They are mounted to the deck using nuts and bolts through the hanger part, on an angle, (usually 35°). When the board is tilted laterally the axles turn together to angle the wheels {{in the direction of the}} turn. Two polyurethane dampers sometimes known as [...] "egg shocks" [...] are mounted between the hanger and the axle housing on each truck to provide resistance to the lean of the rider during turning. Springs are mounted in the same place with the dampers inside them.|$|E
50|$|The {{pieces are}} ranked, forming a {{hierarchy}} {{with the general}} {{at the top and}} soldiers at the <b>bottom.</b> Only <b>pieces</b> of equal or lower rank may be captured, with one exception. For instance, a chariot may capture a horse, and the general may capture either, but a horse cannot capture a chariot, and neither can capture the general. The one exception concerns generals and soldiers: the general cannot capture soldiers, and soldiers can capture the general. This reversal is reminiscent of Stratego.|$|R

5000|$|The Boston Shaker: A two-piece shaker {{consisting}} of a [...] metal bottom and traditionally a [...] glass or plastic mixing glass. The mixing container and bottom are inserted into each other for shaking or used separately for stirring or muddling. A separate strainer, such as a Hawthorne or Julep strainer, are required for this type shaker if crushed ice is used. Without such a strainer, some bartenders may instead strain by narrowly separating the two pieces after shaking and pouring the drink through the resulting gap. The market offers now [...] and [...] container versions too. Beginning in the late 1870s and early 1880s, versions of the Boston Shaker appeared with the metal <b>bottom</b> <b>piece</b> containing integral strainer mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|There are two shafts {{belonging}} to two spiral crosses, both are carved from white sandstone and each in two parts. One is 1.15 metres high and 40 centimetres wide. The top piece has plait-work in sham double strands; with bosses in every available place. The <b>bottom</b> <b>piece</b> holds a carved swastika. The {{two parts of}} the other slab are together 92 centimetres high and 38 centimetres wide and 15 centimetres thick. There is evidently a portion missing between the two. Two broad lateral bands passing round bosses, haze a central scroll at the top, whilst in the lower part are the body and legs of a man, with the swastika below. This has been taken as representing the crucifixion of Jesus. In all there are nine slabs in the vestry.|$|E

5000|$|When {{foreign trade}} {{introduced}} into China new herbal aromatics in the 2nd century BC, a unique incense burner was designed. [...] The boshanlu stemmed cup was {{topped by a}} perforated lid {{in the shape of}} one of the sacred mountains/islands, such as Mount Penglai - focus of a strong contemporary belief - often with the images of mythical persons and beasts throughout the hillsides. Smaller versions of the pen dish were sometimes used as <b>bottom</b> <b>pieces</b> either to catch hot embers or to be filled with water to represent the ocean out of which the sacred mountains/islands arose. Originally made out of bronze, ceramic, or talc stone, some later versions were believed to be actual interestingly-shaped stones which occasionally were partly covered with moss and lichens to further heighten the miniature representation. [...] Since at least the 1st century AD, Daoist mysticism has included the recreating of magical sites in miniature to focus and increase the properties found in the full-size sites. The various schools of Buddhism introduced from India after the mid-2nd century included the meditative dhyana sect, whose translations of Sanscrit texts sometimes used Daoist terminology to convey non-physical concepts. Also, floral altar decorations were introduced and floral designs started to become a dominant force in Chinese art. Five centuries later the Chán school of Buddhism was established, in which renewed Indian dhyana Buddhist teachings were merged with native Chinese Daoism. Chán maintained its more active, vital spirit even as other Buddhist sects were becoming more rigidly formalized.|$|R
