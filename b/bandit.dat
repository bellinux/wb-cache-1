5|$|Himmler set the SS and SD {{to work on}} {{developing}} additional anti-partisan tactics and launched a propaganda campaign. Sometime in June 1943, Himmler issued the Bandenbekämpfung (<b>bandit</b> fighting) order, simultaneously announcing {{the existence of the}} Bandenkampfverbände (<b>bandit</b> fighting formations), with SS-Obergruppenführer Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski as its chief. Employing troops primarily from the SS police and Waffen-SS, the Bandenkampfverbände had four principal operational components: propaganda, centralized control and coordination of security operations, training of troops, and battle operations. Once the Wehrmacht had secured territorial objectives, the Bandenkampfverbände first secured communications facilities, roads, railways, and waterways. Thereafter, they secured rural communities and economic installations such as factories and administrative buildings. An additional priority was securing agricultural and forestry resources. The SS oversaw the collection of the harvest, which was deemed critical to strategic operations. Any Jews in the area were rounded up and killed. Communists and people of Asiatic descent were killed presumptively under the assumption that they were Soviet agents.|$|E

50|$|Southwestern China {{had been}} long plagued by <b>bandits</b> that had {{continuously}} existed for centuries. By the time the Nationalist government had lost control in {{the region in the}} face of the advancing Communist army, there were over half a million <b>bandits</b> active in the region. In Sichuan alone, there were over three hundred bands of <b>bandits.</b> In Yunnan, there were a hundred forty - eight bands of <b>bandits.</b> In Guizhou, there were five hundred forty - one bands of <b>bandits.</b> In addition large numbers of <b>bandits</b> were also active in Xikang. The number of <b>bandits</b> soon would more than double to more than a million, encouraged by the Nationalist government, which previously had attempted to eradicate them. After the Chengdu Campaign concluded in December 1949, many retreating Nationalist military units joined forces with local <b>bandits</b> to continue their struggle against the Communists, but the alliance was a fragile one, and still allowed the Communists to defeat them separately.|$|R
5|$|Peng {{remained}} behind to guard Jinggangshan {{with a force}} of 800 soldiers, but withdrew from the area when it was attacked by a Hunanese Kuomintang force of 25,000 soldiers, joining Zhu and Mao in Ruijin in March. Although he had saved his force from destruction, he was criticized by Mao for withdrawing. Peng returned to Jinggangshan with a force of 1,000 men later that year, occupying the area after the Kuomintang withdrew. In mid-1929 Peng's forces merged with the forces of two local <b>bandit</b> groups, but conflicts arose over supplies and the command structure, and the two groups rebelled against Peng in July 1929. One of the <b>bandit</b> leaders was captured and executed by Peng, and the other committed suicide. The remaining forces were incorporated into Peng's unit, bringing its strength up to 2,000 men. Peng then organized a series of increasingly ambitious raids into southern Hunan throughout 1929 and 1930, capturing an increasing amount of supplies and attracting more recruits.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{stories to}} Si Ronda's include those of Si Jampang and Si Pitung; these stage plays centred on {{extraordinary}} men (referred to as jago) who, though living outside the law, generally {{fought for the}} common populace. Adaptations of the genre, manifested as <b>bandit</b> films, became popular in domestic cinema following the release of Si Tjonat by Batavia Motion Picture in 1929. This release {{was followed by the}} Wong brothers' Rampok Preanger (also 1929), and an adaptation of the Si Pitung stories in 1931. Not all films in this genre, which consisted of a quarter of all domestic releases for 1929–1931, maintained the heroic qualities of the central character: the Wongs' adaptation of Si Pitung, for instance, portrayed him as a simple <b>bandit</b> and not the Robin Hood figure of stage.|$|E
