2500|$|Following {{the end of}} the {{lockdown}} of the temple, {{the junta}} stated authorities will look for Luang Por Dhammajayo elsewhere. However, investigations against the temple continued. Just days after {{the end of the}} lockdown, additional charges were filed against Wat Phra Dhammakaya, this time against the deputy abbot, Luang Por Dattajivo, for allegedly using the Klongchan Credit Union money to <b>buy</b> <b>stocks</b> and illegal land, something the temple dubbed [...] "fake news". Some Thai news outlets, such as Khao Sod English, became critical of the new charges, stating that weeks after the accusations were made neither the junta nor DSI have produced any form of evidence supporting the alleged trading of stocks, describing the accusations as [...] "a new invention, followed by silence".|$|E
2500|$|Speculative {{economic}} bubbles are {{an obvious}} anomaly, {{in that the}} market often appears {{to be driven by}} buyers operating on escalating market sentiment/ [...] irrational exuberance, who take little notice of underlying value. These bubbles are typically followed by an overreaction of frantic selling, allowing shrewd investors to <b>buy</b> <b>stocks</b> at bargain prices. Rational investors have difficulty profiting by shorting irrational bubbles because, {{in the words of a}} famous saying attributed to John Maynard Keynes, [...] "Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent." [...] Sudden market crashes as happened on Black Monday in 1987 are mysterious from the perspective of efficient markets, but allowed as a rare statistical event under the weak-form of EMH. Benoit Mandelbrot has argued that market bubbles are not anomalous but rather characteristic of price dynamics described by power laws such as Pareto, Zipf [...] or Tracy-Widom [...] combined with persistence in price change trends.|$|E
2500|$|During the New Deal {{years as}} well as the 1940s, there was much less focus on Wall Street and finance. The {{government}} clamped down on the practice of buying equities based only on credit, but these policies began to ease. From 1946 to 1947, stocks could not be purchased [...] "on margin", meaning that an investor had to pay 100% of a stock's cost without taking on any loans. But this margin requirement was reduced four times before 1960, each time stimulating a mini-rally and boosting volume, and when the Federal Reserve reduced the margin requirements from 90% to 70%. These changes made it somewhat easier for investors to <b>buy</b> <b>stocks</b> on credit. The growing national economy and prosperity led to a recovery during the 1960s, with some down years during the early 1970s {{in the aftermath of the}} Vietnam War. Trading volumes climbed; in 1967, according to Time Magazine, volume hit 7.5 million shares a day which caused a [...] "traffic jam" [...] of paper with [...] "batteries of clerks" [...] working overtime to [...] "clear transactions and update customer accounts".|$|E

50|$|When {{it comes}} to {{financing}} a purchase of stocks there are two ways: purchasing stock with money that is currently in the buyer's ownership, or by <b>buying</b> <b>stock</b> on margin. <b>Buying</b> <b>stock</b> on margin means <b>buying</b> <b>stock</b> with money borrowed against the value of stocks in the same account. These stocks, or collateral, guarantee that the buyer can repay the loan; otherwise, the stockbroker {{has the right to}} sell the stock (collateral) to repay the borrowed money. He can sell if the share price drops below the margin requirement, at least 50% {{of the value of the}} stocks in the account. Buying on margin works the same way as borrowing money to buy a car or a house, using a car or house as collateral. Moreover, borrowing is not free; the broker usually charges 8-10% interest.|$|R

40|$|We {{relate the}} {{performance}} of mutual fund trades to their motivation. A fund manager who <b>buys</b> <b>stocks</b> when there are heavy investor outflows {{is likely to be}} motivated by the belief that the stocks are significantly undervalued. In contrast, when there are heavy inflows, the manager is likely to be motivated to work off excess liquidity by <b>buying</b> <b>stocks.</b> Our analysis reveals that managers making purely valuation-motivated purchases substantially beat the market but are unable to do so when compelled to invest excess cash from investor inflows. A similar, but weaker, pattern is found for stocks that are sold. (JEL G 11, G 29) Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} ways of <b>buying</b> <b>stock</b> besides through a broker. One way is {{directly}} from the company itself.

However, the initial share of stock in the company {{will have to be}} obtained through a regular stock broker. Another way to <b>buy</b> <b>stock</b> in companies is through Direct Public Offerings which are usually sold by the company itself. A direct public offering is an initial public offering in which the stock is purchased directly from the company, usually without the aid of brokers.|$|R
5000|$|Claims {{about the}} Working Group {{generally}} propose {{that it is}} an orchestrated mechanism that attempts to manipulate U.S. stock markets {{in the event of a}} market crash by using government funds to <b>buy</b> <b>stocks,</b> or other instruments such as stock index futures—acts which are forbidden by law.
