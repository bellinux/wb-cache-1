40|$|The enantiomers of two acylamine {{fungicides}} (metalaxyl and <b>benalaxyl)</b> {{were separated}} by EKC using CDs as chiral selectors. The use of 15 mM succinyl [...] CD for metalaxyl and 5 mM succinyl [...] CD for <b>benalaxyl</b> dissolved in a 50 mM 2 -morpholinoethanesulfonic acid buffer (pH 6. 5), enabled the chiral separation of metalaxyl enantiomers in 11. 5 min with a resolution of 3. 1 and the enantiomeric separation of <b>benalaxyl</b> in 7. 5 min with a resolution close to 15. Under these conditions, the two enantiomers {{of each of the}} chiral compound studied were also separated from folpet, very commonly present in fungicide formulations containing metalaxyl or <b>benalaxyl.</b> The analytical characteristics of the two developed methods were studied in terms of precision, linearity, selectivity, limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantitation (LOQs) showing their suitability for the determination of these compounds in commercial agrochemical formulations. Finally, the development of an in-capillary preconcentration strategy allowed the detection of enantiomeric impurities up to 1. 2 % in commercial products labeled as enantiomerically pure in metalaxyl-M...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} decline of the residues of <b>benalaxyl,</b> chlorothalonil and methomyl in a variety of processing tomato grown in open field. Tomato plants were subjected to a single chemical treatment, when fruits were close to ripeness, by applying pesticides at the doses recommended by the manufacturers. Fruit samples were periodically taken {{until the end of the}} preharvest interval (p. i.). The pesticide residues were extracted using acetone and dichloromethane as solvents and determined by gas (<b>benalaxyl</b> and chlorothalonil) and liquid (methomyl) chromatography. The results obtained showed that all the active ingredients had a degradation of first-order kinetics. The residual concentrations after the p. i. were below the legal limits, nevertheless, the value for <b>benalaxyl</b> seemed to be rather high. This finding indicates the need for careful control of the spraying doses of this fungicide, in particular on varieties of tomato which are used fresh...|$|E
40|$|The {{fate of the}} {{residues}} of <b>benalaxyl,</b> dimethoate, iprodione, metalaxyl, phosalone, procymidone, and vinclozolin {{in sunlight}} and oven raisin processing was studied. The drying process caused a fruit concentration factor of 4, while the decreases in residue with the two drying processes were different for the different pesticides. In sunlight-drying the residue level in the raisins was identical {{to that in the}} fresh fruits for <b>benalaxyl,</b> metalaxyl, and phosalone, whereas it was higher for iprodione (1. 6) and lower for vinclozolin and dimethoate (one-third and one-fifth, respectively). The oven-drying process was preceded by washing, which caused residue decreases for iprodione and procymidone of 57 and 41 %, respectively, whereas no decrease was observed in all of the other pesticides. During oven-drying pesticide residues in raisins with respect to fresh fruits showed an increase of 2. 7 for phosalone, the same values for <b>benalaxyl,</b> metalaxyl, and procymidone, and lower values for vinclozolin and dimethoate. Sunlight-drying was more effective for phosalone and vinclozolin, whereas oven-drying was more effective for iprodione and procymidone, which was due to the washing effect rather than to dehydration. The experiments carried out with a model system showed that the decrease in dimethoate is attributable to heat, whereas in <b>benalaxyl,</b> procymidone, and phosalone it is due to codistillation and in iprodione and metalaxyl to the combined action of heat and codistillation...|$|E
40|$|In this diploma thesis, a {{preliminary}} {{study on the}} applicability of EKC-PF (with CD as chiral selector) to the separation of chiral pesticides was performed. In introduction, theoretical informations are presented concerning electrophoresis instrumentation and theory as well as different electrophoresis modes. Then, enantiomeric separation is introduced through cyclodextrins and possibilities of partial filling mode to finally terminate with a definition of chiral pesticides and some information about their enantioseparation. Concretely, in the experimental part, the evaluation of enantioresolution of several chiral pesticides (trichlorphon, cyproconazole, hexaconazole, imazalil, myclobutanil, penconazole, tebuconazole, propiconazole, and <b>benalaxyl)</b> using CM-β-CD as chiral selector was performed. First of all, a univariate optimization of variables (CM-β-CD injection time, voltage, temperature, pH, and buffer nature and concentration) was carried out for <b>benalaxyl.</b> Finally a screening, involving {{the effect of the}} CM-β-CD injection time, was performed for the other pesticides to check the potential of this CD as chiral selector...|$|E
40|$|Aspergillus fumigatus {{is a human}} {{pathogen}} {{but it is also}} a widespread filamentous fungus in the environment. A. fumigatus can therefore be exposed to antifungals used in medical and agricultural environments. Only the class of azoles is used in both of these environments (i. e., voriconazole and itraconazole in medicine; prochloraz, propiconazole or imazalil in agriculture). Exposure to azoles provides the potential for the development of resistance. Several clinical itraconazole-resistant isolates have been reported in A. fumigatus and their resistance mechanisms have been partially resolved. Since limited data exist on the susceptibility of A. fumigatus to both medical and agricultural antifungals, we undertook a drug susceptibility study including clinical (400) and agricultural (150) A. fumigatus isolates (Swiss origin). We tested azoles and also compounds of major antifungal classes used in agriculture (i. e., azoxystrobin, iprodione, <b>benalaxyl</b> or cyprodinil). The results showed that all A. fumigatus isolates were intrinsically resistant to iprodione, <b>benalaxyl</b> or cyprodinil (MIC 90 > 32 µg. ml− 1) and that azoxystrobin minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) showed a wide range (0. 06 to 32 µg. ml− 1). MIC ranges of azoles were compound-dependent. MIC 90 for voriconazole, itraconazole, imazalil and prochloraz were within a range of 0. 125 to 1 µg. ml− 1 and similar between clinical and environmental isolates, whereas propiconazole was the least active compound (MIC 90 : 4 - 8 µg. ml− 1). Ten clinical and 36 environmental isolates with high itraconazole MIC (≥ 2 µg. ml− 1) were detected. In clinical isolates, no cross-resistance was observed between itraconazole and all others azoles tested. Several patterns of azole MICs for were, however, observed in the environmental isolates. Unexpectedly, a single environmental isolate was voriconazole-resistant (MIC of 16 µg. ml− 1) but still susceptible to itraconazole (MIC of 2 µg. ml− 1). Taken together, our results demonstrate the absence of susceptibility of A. fumigatus isolates to non-azole agricultural agents and that there is little impact of azole resistance in both clinical and environmental isolates. When detected, azole resistance was compound-specifi...|$|E
40|$|FgABC 1 (FGSG_ 04580) is {{predicted}} to encode a pleiotropic drug resistance class ABC transporter in Fusarium graminearum, a globally important pathogen of wheat. Deletion mutants of FgABC 1 showed reduced virulence towards wheat in crown and root infection assays but were unaltered in infectivity on barley. Expression of FgABC 1 during head blight and crown rot disease increases during the necrotrophic phases of infection suggestive of a role for FgABC 1 in late infection stages in different tissue types. Deletion of FgABC 1 also led to increased sensitivity of the fungus to the antifungal compound <b>benalaxyl</b> in culture, but the response to known cereal defence compounds, gramine, 2 -benzoxazalinone and tryptamine was unaltered. FgABC 1 {{appears to have a}} role in protecting the fungus from antifungal compounds and is likely to help combat as yet unidentified wheat defence compounds during disease development.

40|$|The {{residual}} {{behavior of}} four dicarboximidic and three acylanilidic fungicides was studied in greenhouse grown tomatoes. In different experiments tomatoes underwent single spraying and five sprayings with an interval of 21 days, at rates of application of 380 and 760 g/ha (acylanilides) and 1500 and 3000 g/ha (dicarboximides). The harvesting {{was carried out}} weekly. Residues recovered after repeated sprayings confirmed the well-known trend of the four dicarboximidic fungicides: toxically significant accumulation in fruits several days after recommended preharvest times. Among acylanilides, only furalaxyl and <b>benalaxyl</b> showed the accumulation of residues but always at concentrations lower than legal limits, even before the fixed preharvest times. The possible need is raised to revise preharvest times for both categories of fungicide. When tomatoes were single sprayed, the fungicide disappearance from fruits showed pseudo-first-order rate dependence only for dicarboximides; degradation products of the latter, found in a different matrix (wine), were not detected. ...|$|E
40|$|The fate {{of eight}} {{fungicides}} (<b>benalaxyl,</b> fenarimol, iprodione, metalaxyl, myclobutanil, procymidone, triadimefon, and vinclozolin) and five insecticides (dimethoate, fenthion, methidathion, parathion methyl, and quinalphos) in wine and its byproducts (cake and lees) during {{the production of}} distilled spirits was studied. Among the pesticides studied, only fenthion, quinalphos, and vinclozolin residues {{were present in the}} distilled spirits. During wine distillation, respectively 13 % and 5 % of the initial residues of fenthion and vinclozolin were transferred to the distilled spirit. Low percentages (2 % for fenthion and 0. 1 % for vinclozolin) of these active ingredients (AI) also passed from the lees to the final-distilled spirit, when samples were fortified at 10. 1 and 26. 1 ppm for fenthion and vinclozolin, respectively. Quinalphos passed only from the lees to the final-distilled spirit in percentages lower than 1 % when samples were fortified at the highest concentration (4. 6 ppm) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{enantioselective}} {{environmental behavior}} of the chiral fungicides benalaxy and furalaxyl in agricultural soils in China was studied. Although sorption onto soils was non-enantioselective, the leaching of benalaxy and furalaxyl was enantioselective in soil columns. The concentrations of the S-enantiomers of both fungicides in the leachates were higher than the R-enantiomers. This {{can be attributed to}} enantioselective degradation of the two fungicides in the soil column. Enantioselective degradation of the two fungicides was verified by soil dissipation experiments, and the R-enantiomers degraded faster than the S-enantiomers in partial soils. The half-life was 27. 7 - 57. 8 days for S-benalaxyl, 20. 4 - 53. 3 days for R-benalaxyl, 19. 3 - 49. 5 days for S-furalaxyl and 11. 434. 7 days for R-furalaxyl. The degradation process of the two fungicide enantiomers followed the first-order kinetics (R- 2 > 0. 96). Compared to furalaxyl, <b>benalaxyl</b> degraded more slowly and degradation was less enantioselective. These results are attributed to the influence of soil physicochemical properties, soil microorganisms, and environmental factors...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The present {{studies were}} {{conducted}} {{to better understand the}} etiology, epidemiology and potential control of the Phytophthora stem root rot as it occurs in apple stool beds. Symptoms of Phytophthora root and stem rot occurred as early as May and continued to develop throughout the growing season. Sunken brown-black lesions were visible on shoots, some of which wilted, or exhibited rust-brown or purplish bronzed leaves. Infected roots were red-brown. Some stem lesions were yellow-brown with narrow dark brown margins forming concentric, wavy-margined rings up the stem. Phytophthora cactorum and P. cambivora were both recovered from the stool beds and identified as the probable causal agents of the disease. P. cactorum was more frequently isolated with peak recovery in early September. P. cambivora recovery peaked in mid summer. Both species were pathogenic at either 15 or 24 °C, but P. cactorum was more virulent than P. cambivora at both temperatures and is probably the more active of the two species in the field as well. Fosetyl-Al and metalaxyl applied to apple rootstocks in the field reduced the severity of disease subsequently induced by P. cactorum in an excised stem assay. These field treatments also reduced the development of disease in trees graded as healthy and held in cold storage for 3 to 9 months. Root dipping pre-, post-, or pre- and post-cold storage of trees graded either as healthy or mildly infected, with the chemicals <b>benalaxyl,</b> etridiazol, fosetyl-Al or metalaxyl gave variable results. Any chemical dip treatment reduced disease development compared to the untreated controls, but fosetyl-Al and metalaxyl at 12000 or 4000 ppm, respectively, applied pre-cold storage gave the best disease control over all. The development in apple stool beds of stem and root rot caused by P. cactorum and P. cambivora was reduced in the field by applications of fosetyl-Al and/or metalaxyl applied to trees during the growing season, and reduced further by a root dip before cold storage...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pesticides {{are used}} to control pests and {{diseases}} in modern agriculture but unfortunately their residues {{can be found on}} agricultural crops, and in the human’s dietary. Although the best way to decrease the risk associated with the presence of pesticides on agro-food is following organic farming techniques, most farmers may not avoid the use of chemicals in pest management strategies. A good approach to the problem should therefore guarantee good agricultural yields and low pesticide residues allowing the use of environmental safety pesticides on crops, so joining consumer’s safeness with farmer’s necessity. Results: The behaviour of various pesticides used in IPM strategies on grapes and tomatoes were studied. All the analytical methods showed good recoveries, and good separation of the molecules. Repeatability and intermediate precision showed good results, and LODs and LOQs were far below the MRLs set by EU for these pesticides in tomatoes and grapes. The analysis of pesticide residues on tomatoes showed that cv. with little berries accounted for higher residue levels than cv. with big berries. They also showed an high persistence of azoxystrobin, cyproconazole, cyprodinil, penconazole, tolclofos-methyl, mepanipyrim, pyrimethanil, famoxadone fenamidone, fenhexamid, iprodione, and a rapid degradation of triadimenol, cymoxanil, iprovalicarb, fenarimol, and fludioxonil. On grapes, the behaviour in field and the transfer to wine during winemaking of iprovalicarb, indoxacarb, and boscalid, was studied. The residue levels found in grapes were far below the MRLs set for grapes in EU, accounting at harvest time 0. 81, 0. 43, and 4. 23 mg/kg for iprovalicarb, indoxacarb, and boscalid, respectively. The residue levels in the samples treated with boscalid may have residual problems (due to an accumulation effect) if repeated field treatments will be performed. Winemaking experiments showed a complete transfer of all pesticide from grapes to the must, while in wine the residues were low or negligible due to the adsorbing effect of lees and pomace. The clarification experiments showed a good removal of pesticide residues from the wine media, for all pesticides. The data obtained in two years survey of pesticide residues on wines following IPM strategies, showed residues less than maximum residue limits (MRLs). The most pesticides present a residue absent, some (<b>benalaxyl,</b> metalaxyl, iprovalicarb, penconazole, cymoxanil and thiophanate-metyl) showed a residual below the minimum limit of detection (LOD). No residues were found above the LOQ (0, 01 mg/kg). Conclusions: The obtained data showed the possibility to get tomatoes and wine at "zero residue" or, at least, with residues below the limit of quantification (LOQ). The data collected on tomato have also shown the difference in initial deposition of pesticide joined {{to the size of the}} berries in order to obtain products with lower pesticide residues, paying more attention to chemical treatments for the defense of cultivars with small berries. ...|$|E
