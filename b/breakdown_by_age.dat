40|$|Purpose: To examine smoking {{behaviours}} in Taiwan {{and compare}} those behaviours {{to those in}} the USA. Methods: Using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) of Taiwan (2001), a survey of over 20 000 participants, frequencies were calculated for smoking, ex-smoking, quantity smoked, and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). <b>Breakdowns</b> <b>by</b> <b>age,</b> sex, and socioeconomic status were also calculated. Results: The ratio of male to female smoking rates was 10. 9 to 1 among adults (46. 8 %/ 4. 3 %), but 3. 6 to 1 among underage teenagers (14. 3 %/ 4. 0 %). The proportion of underage to adult smokers was three times higher for girls than for boys. Smoking prevalence substantially increased during and after high school years, and peaked in those aged 30 – 39 years. Smoking rates of high school age adolescents increased more than threefold if they did not attend school or if they finished their education after high school. Low income and less educated smokers smoked at nearly twice the rate of high income and better educated smokers. The smoker/ex-smoker ratio was close to 7. Male daily smokers smoked on average 17 cigarettes/day, and females, 11. Half of the total population, especially infants and women of childbearing age, were exposed to ETS at home.

40|$|Dengue {{presents}} a formidable and growing global economic and disease burden, with around half the world's population {{estimated to be}} at risk of infection. There is wide variation and substantial uncertainty in current estimates of dengue disease burden and, consequently, on economic burden estimates. Dengue disease varies across time, geography and persons affected. Variations in the transmission of four different viruses and interactions among vector density and host's immune status, age, pre-existing medical conditions, all contribute to the disease's complexity. This systematic review aims to identify and examine estimates of dengue disease burden and costs, discuss major sources of uncertainty, and suggest next steps to improve estimates. Economic analysis of dengue is mainly concerned with costs of illness, particularly in estimating total episodes of symptomatic dengue. However, national dengue disease reporting systems show a great diversity in design and implementation, hindering accurate global estimates of dengue episodes and country comparisons. A combination of immediate, short-, and long-term strategies could substantially improve estimates of disease and, consequently, of economic burden of dengue. Suggestions for immediate implementation include refining analysis of currently available data to adjust reported episodes and expanding data collection in empirical studies, such as documenting the number of ambulatory visits before and after hospitalization and including <b>breakdowns</b> <b>by</b> <b>age.</b> Short-term recommendations include merging multiple data sources, such as cohort and surveillance data to evaluate the accuracy of reporting rates (by health sector, treatment, severity, etc.), and using covariates to extrapolate dengue incidence to locations with no or limited reporting. Long-term efforts aim at strengthening capacity to document dengue transmission using serological methods to systematically analyze and relate to epidemiologic data. As promising tools for diagnosis, vaccination, vector control, and treatment are being developed, these recommended steps should improve objective, systematic measures of dengue burden to strengthen health policy decisions...|$|R

South African Medical Journal, 104 (2) : 124 - 126, doi: 10. 7196 /SAMJ. 7310. The original publication is available at [URL] A helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) was established in 2005 in Richards Bay, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, to provide primary response and inter-facility transfers to a largely rural area {{with a population of}} 3. 4 million people. Objective. To describe the first 5 years of operation of the HEMS. Methods. A chart review of all flights from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2010 was conducted. Results. A total of 1 429 flights were undertaken; 3 were excluded from analysis (missing folders). Most flights (88. 4 %) were inter-facility transfers (IFTs). Almost 10 % were cancelled after takeoff. The <b>breakdown</b> <b>by</b> <b>age</b> was 61. 9 % adult, 15. 1 % paediatric and 21. 6 % neonate. The main indications for IFTs were obstetrics (34. 5 %), paediatrics (27. 9 %) and trauma (15. 9 %). For primary response most cases were trauma (72. 9 %) and obstetrics (11. 3 %). The median on-scene time for neonates was significantly longer (48 min, interquartile range (IQR) 35 - 64 min) than that for adults (36 min, IQR 26 - 48; p< 0. 001) and paediatrics (36 min, IQR 25 - 51; p< 0. 02). On-scene times for doctor-paramedic crews (45 min, IQR 27 - 50) were significantly longer than for paramedic-only crews (38 min, IQR 27 - 57; p< 0. 001). Conclusion. The low flight-to-population ratio and primary response rate may indicate under-utilisation of the air medical service in an area with a shortage of advanced life support crews and long transport distances. Further studies on HEMSs in rural Africa are needed, particularly with regard to cost-benefit analyses, optimal activation criteria and triage systems. [URL] versio...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{known for a long time}} that many traffic {{accidents}} are not known to the police, but are dealt with by the health service. Because of this, the official statistics concerning persons injured in traffic, which are based on accidents known to the police, are misleading. In this study, data from the in-patient records of the Swedish Board of Health and Welfare concerning treatment episodes terminated during the period 1998 - 2004 were therefore examined. In this way it is possible to give an augmented account of the number of in-patient injuries in road traffic accidents, and the development in the number of accidents to pedestrians in a street/road environment, without the involvement of vehicles, can also be observed. On average, more than 12, 000 persons annually were hospitalised in 1998 - 2004 as a result of road traffic accidents. The average number is slightly higher in the years after the turn of the century. <b>Breakdown</b> <b>by</b> <b>age</b> among injuries in road traffic accidents has been fairly stable. The injury index "number of in-patient injuries per thousand population" has shown a tendency to increase slightly during the period. The 15 - 24 age group consistently has a higher injury index than other ages. Among the injuries, the proportions of motorists and motoryclists/moped riders have increased. Motorists account for 44 per cent of in-patient injuries in both 2003 and 2004, motorcyclists/moped riders for over 18 per cent. On comparing these statistics with the official statistics concerning persons severely injured in road traffic accidents, it is found that the number of injured cyclists according to in-patient data is 6 - 10 times higher. For all road users, the number of injuries according to in-patient data is about three times higher than the number of severe injuries according to police reports. Pedestrians have the longest average treatment periods; this applies to almost all age classes. The principal diagnosis made at the time of initial hospitalisation is given in this report. Fractures account for more than one third of injuries and for almost one half of the treatment period. For the seven-year period 1998 - 2004, the report also shows an average of about 2, 200 in-patient injuries annually caused by pedestrians falling in a street/road environment without the involvement of a vehicle. The most common cause is "fall in the same plane" due to slipping/tripping/stumbling in the absence of ice/snow.

40|$|Session - OP 19 - 6 D: Symposium: Men and Suicide: Addressing the Gender GapBACKGROUND: Self-harm is {{expected}} to be 10 to 20 times more frequent than suicide. Traditionally, it has been more common among females than males, but some recent studies showed similar rates across genders and even higher rates among males. In Hong Kong, 12 -month prevalence rate of suicide attempts also revealed no gender difference among adolescents. AIM: To investigate the trend of gender-specific incidence rates of self-harm presenting to public hospitals in Hong Kong METHOD: 32, 308 records of emergency presentation and 36, 411 records of inpatient admission as a result of self-harm between 2002 and 2011 were obtained. 9, 246 overlapping records were identified, resulting in 59, 473 distinct episodes of self-harm by 48, 460 patients. Capture-recapture approach was employed to estimate the number of undercount in the two data sources. Multinomial logit model was carried out to model the heterogeneous capture probabilities by including gender, age, method of self-harm and year of incidence as covariates. Annual incidence rates of self-harm were then calculated based on these estimated number of episodes after incompleteness adjustment. RESULTS: The average annual incidence rate of self-harm was 116. 0 (95 % C. I. = 115. 2 - 116. 9) per 100, 000 in Hong Kong for the period 2002 - 2011. Incidence rate of males (121. 1 per 100, 000) was a little bit higher than that for females (111. 5 per 100, 000). The usual gender pattern sharply reversed in 2003, since when the annual rates for men have remained persistently higher than for women. This gender gap gradually widened since 2007, and self-harm by males has become 16 - 21 % more frequent than among females in later years. Breakdown by method of self-harm suggested that the changing gender pattern was attributed to self-poisoning. Self-poisoning among females was fairly stable across the study period, but that among males experienced extraordinary increase in each of the years 2003 and 2007. Further <b>breakdown</b> <b>by</b> <b>age</b> group revealed that such increase could mainly be observed from working-age males. CONCLUSION: The traditional gender pattern of self-harm might have changed in Hong Kong during the past decade. Such transformation was primarily accounted for by the increased popularity of self-poisoning among men. The elevated rate of self-poisoning in 2003 and 2007 remained high afterwards and did not return to its original level. This suggests {{the emergence of a new}} cohort of male self-harming patients, and/or probably a change in their help-seeking behavior...|$|E

The economic cost of spina bifida and its prevention using folic acid have never been estimated in Italy. This {{study was conducted to}} define the cost of illness of SB in Italy. Methods: A retrospective multicenter observational study on the social cost of patients with SB was carried out in three SB centers in Italy. Cost data were collected relating to the 12 months preceding the enrollment time (T 0), and subsequently 3 months after the T 0 time (± 20 days) through a case report form designed to collect the relevant information on the costs incurred during the period considered. The data for all patients were analyzed through multivariate analysis on the main parameters. Results: We enrolled 128 patients equally divided between males and females, {{with a mean age of}} 13 years (minimum, 0; maximum, 29). Diagnosis was mostly postnatal, with 64 cases diagnosed at birth and 33 cases diagnosed subsequently. The lesion severity levels, as defined in the inclusion criteria, were walking (52 patients); walking with simple orthoses (33 patients); walking with complex orthoses (16 patients); and nonwalking, (25 patients). The anatomic type identified is open SB in most cases (84 patients), followed by closed SB (37 patients) and SB occulta (3 patients). The most significant cost per year was for assistive devices, for a total of 4307. 00 €, followed by hospitalization (907. 00 €), examinations (592. 00 €), and drug therapy (328. 00 €). Cost <b>breakdown</b> <b>by</b> <b>age</b> range shows that the highest costs are incurred in the 0 – 4 age range. The highest cost was for cases of open SB (12, 103. 00 €). The cost/degree of severity ratio showed that the highest cost was for nonwalking patients (14, 323. 00 €), followed by patients walking with complex orthoses (13, 799. 00 €). Conclusion: The data from this study show that the mean total cost for a patient with SB was 11, 351. 00 € per year. Based on data provided by the Italian Institute of Health, we can estimate a total annual social cost of about 60 million Euros per year for SB in Italy.

30|$|The {{questionnaire}} was answered by 300 people from Greater Sydney area in Australia. The age range {{included in the}} sample was between under 18 s and over 65 s. Initial data collection provided too high a proportion of older people and for analysis, {{a random sample of}} the older people was made to ensure that the final proportion of older people was proportional to the number of persons over 65, as shown by the census data [25]. This was done to better represent the population by being more representative of people in each age category. The final sample size was 219 respondents with a gender split of 52.97 % females, 46.58 % males and 0.45 % of respondents (1 person) who preferred not to answer the gender question. A <b>breakdown</b> of respondents <b>by</b> <b>age</b> and sex showed roughly equal male and female respondents in all age groups except 40 – 45  years old where there were more females than males and in the 50 – 55 and 60 – 65 age groups where there were more males than females, especially in the 60 – 65 age group.|$|R
40|$|U razdoblju od 1990. do 2009. godine Higijensko epidemiološkom odjelu Novi Zagreb prijavljeno je 58. 268 zaraznih bolesti. Prijavljeno je 4. 492 salmoneloza što čini 8 %. Prosječna incidencija je 179 oboljelih na 100. 000 stanovnika. Najviša incidencija je u djece do prve godine života (880 / 100. 000). Najčešće izolirani serotip je Salmonella enteritidis (84 %), zatim slijedi Salmonella typhimurium (7 %), Salmonella virchow (3 %) te Salmonella hadar (2 %). Žene obolijevaju nešto češće od muškaraca. Odnos oboljelih žena i muškaraca je 1, 2 : 1. Akutno kliconoštvo zabilježeno je kod 2. 557 (57 %) osoba, dok je kronično kliconoštvo bilo prisutno u 139 (3 %) osoba. Za vrijeme trajanja kliconoštva obrađeno je 22. 460 uzoraka stolica, što je u prosjeku 5 stolica po jednoj oboljeloj osobi. Hospitalizirano je 1. 033 (23 %) osoba, u prosjeku 7 dana, dok je 359 (8 %) osoba boravilo u dnevnoj bolnici. Prijavljene su 3. 592 osobe (88, 4 %) sa simptomima bolesti, u 413 (9, 3 %) salmonela je otkrivena u obradi kontakata, a kod pregleda za sanitarnu knjižicu dokazano je kliconoštvo salmonele u 127 (2, 3 %) osoba. U 90 % salmoneloza radilo se o sporadičnom obolijevanju, a u 10 % se radilo o manjim epidemijama. Najčešći vehikulumi kod alimentarnih infekcija salmonelama su jaja (32 %), kolači (10 %) te piletina (10 %). In Croatia, {{salmonellosis}} is {{the leading}} cause of bacterial foodborne diseases. The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of the disease, patient <b>breakdown</b> <b>by</b> <b>age</b> and sex, the most frequently isolated Salmonella serotypes, the length of carriership, and the most frequent source of infection. It was a retrospective analysis, and the sources of data were reports and epidemiological questionnaires administered to those affected with the disease. During the 1990 - 2009 period, 4492 cases of salmonellosis were reported in the New Zagreb area. The average incidence was 179 / 100, 000. From 2004 onwards, salmonellosis has been on a decrease in Western Europe countries and the USA, whereas in Croatia it is still the leading cause of bacterial food poisoning. The highest incidence is recorded in children up to the age of 1 year (880 / 100, 000), due to low immunity and a lower infective dose. In the observed period (1990 - 2009), the most frequently isolated serotype was Salmonella enteritidis (84 %), followed by Salmonella typhimurium (7 %), Salmonella virchow (3 %) and Salmonella hadar (2 %). There was a slight female predominance (F:M ratio 1. 2 : 1) in salmonellosis cases. All persons affected with the disease are placed under sanitary surveillance including bacteriological control of the stool. Acute carriership was recorded in 2557 (57 %) subjects, whereas stool excretion of Salmonella for more than 90 days (chronic carriership) was present in 139 subjects. In nine (0. 2 %) subjects, chronic carriership was observed for more than a year. During carriership, 22, 460 stool samples were examined, i. e. 5 samples per patient on an average. A total of 1033 (23 %) subjects were hospitalized for 7 days on an average, whereas 359 persons stayed in day hospital (1 - 2 days). Out of 3592 (88. 4 %) subjects with symptoms of the disease reported on their own, Salmonella was detected by the examination of contacts in 413 (9. 3 %) and carriership proven in 127 (2. 3 %) subjects examined for sanitary certificate (persons under sanitary surveillance due to the work with food). There were 90 % of sporadic cases and 10 % of small outbreaks. The most common source of infection were eggs (32 %), poultry (10 %) and pastry (10 %). The outbreaks were mostly confined to the families. Salmonellosis is a major public health and economic problem, as well as an issue pertaining to veterinary and human medicine. The best and most efficient way to prevent the spread of infection by food is reduction of salmonellosis in animal population...|$|E
40|$|The {{policy has}} failed, writes Lesley Russell. Here 2 ̆ 7 s {{what needs to}} be done to fix it AS THE EVIDENCE mounts that efforts to “Close the Gap” in Indigenous {{disadvantage}} are faltering, and with the recognition that much more is needed to tackle the health care needs across all Indigenous communities, we are confronted with evidence that a key mechanism for uncovering and addressing health problems is ineffectual. Health assessment or health check items – under which Medicare will reimburse for preventive health services to Indigenous patients – were introduced in 1999, when a Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) item for an annual health check for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples aged 55 years and older was implemented. In 2004 a new item was introduced for biennial health assessments among adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 15 to 54 years. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Health Check for children under 15 years of age has been in place since May 2006. In comparison with other MBS preventive services, these items were well reimbursed, generally offering a GP between 175 and 200. Nevertheless, the uptake of these items, especially if considered in light of the acknowledged need and the loudly voiced support of doctors’ groups for Indigenous health, has been shamefully low. As a consequence, the lives of children are blighted by preventable infectious diseases, young adults remain ignorant of their risk of diabetes and the harm from substance abuse, and elders die far too young from the consequences of undiagnosed and untreated chronic conditions. These facts are as true for the Indigenous populations of Perth and inner Sydney as they are for those in country towns in New South Wales and Victoria and for the remote communities in central Australia. In May 2010, under the rubric of easing red tape and paperwork for doctors, a number of changes were made to the Medicare Benefits Schedule. As part of these changes, a single item number was introduced for health assessments for Indigenous Australians. It appears that all references to the older items have disappeared from the Medicare Australia website. But it is still possible to track services delivered under these items by looking at the <b>breakdown</b> <b>by</b> <b>age,</b> sex and state for each time period, although it’s a time-consuming exercise, and deriving some data is no longer possible for the outside researcher. Every year over 400, 000 Indigenous Australians are entitled to receive a Medicare heath check. In 2009 – 10 less than 12 per cent of the eligible population got such a check. And despite the emphasis placed on children’s health and the ongoing Northern Territory Emergency Response (NTER), data show that in the Northern Territory in 2009 – 10 only 12. 7 per cent of children aged under 15 got a health check. On top of this, there are no measures in place to ensure that health problems uncovered in the course of health checks are addressed in a timely fashion. There is very little information about this follow-up, but published data suggests that about 80 per cent of health checks show health problems that need treatment or referrals. Even in the NTER communities, with allocated funding for the purpose, the delivery of follow-up care has lagged. The federal government must move quickly to implement and fund an improved program for health assessments across all age groups, including a system to ensure that all health problems found as a consequence of a health check are appropriately addressed and resolved. Serious consideration should be given to a requirement in law that the federal government funds and ensures the delivery of these needed services. A good model is the Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment component of the United States’ Medicaid program. At the very least there should be a requirement that all follow-up services are documented through to resolution. Finally it is imperative that resources are provided for the independent, transparent monitoring and evaluation of this new program. The current situation where the Department of Health and Ageing exhibits no interest in regularly assessing the effectiveness of its own programs and the publicly available data are increasingly limited, means that problems remain hidden and good money is thrown after bad on programs that do not work. Time is ticking away in the government’s self-imposed timeframes on the commitments made in 2008 to closing the life expectancy gap within a generation and halving the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five within a decade. No one – least of all our Indigenous citizens – can afford a major health care policy that is not working. •   A detailed analysis of the use of Indigenous health checks is available here.
