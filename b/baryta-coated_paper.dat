Available in many varieties and different grades and produced by a great number of large and small manufacturers in many countries of the world, this type of photographic paper was the medium for millions of art, technical, and documentary photographs now preserved in museums, historical collections and archives. As a very chemically complex material object, a photograph might harbor some important material clues to support its provenancing and authentication. Scientific investigations conducted at the GCI have identified a number of chemical and physical markers, or signatures, of <b>baryta-coated</b> B&W photographic <b>paper</b> {{that could be used in}} provenancing, authenticating, and in some cases even dating of photographic material and photographs. The X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) analysis of a large number of 20 th century photographs and photographic paper from the GCI’s and Paul Messier’s reference collections has shown that photographs and photographic papers contain—in addition to silver—several other chemical elements such as barium, strontium and calcium. These elements were introduced in different stages of the photographic paper manufacturin...|$|R
