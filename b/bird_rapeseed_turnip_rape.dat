We used long-term yield datasets of FAO for Finland (1960 s to date) and MTT Agrifood Research Finland (MTT) Official Variety Trial datasets on yield and quality of major field crops in Finland since the 1970 s. Yield variability was exceptionally high in the 1980 s and 1990 s, but previously and subsequently national yields were clearly more stable. No progressive increase in yield variability was recorded. No marked and systematic changes in variability of quality traits were recorded, except for rapeseed, which exhibited reduced variability in seed chlorophyll content. This may at least partly attribute to the differences in intensity of input use and thereby responsiveness of the crops before and after 1980 and 1990 decades. We also noted that in the 2000 s average temperatures were higher than in earlier decades and this was the case for all months of the growing season except June, which represents, however, the most critical phase for yield determination in most of the field crops in Finland. Also in the 2000 s precipitation increased {{in the first three months}} of the growing season and thereafter decreased, but without signs of significantly increased numbers of heavy showers (extreme rain events). Hence, in general constant, increased average temperatures during the growing seasons of the 2000 s were identified, but with reduced yield variability, which was partly attributable to the diminished use of inputs, especially fertilisers. ...|$|R

This issue may be solved by including a catch crop in a crop rotation. For instance, winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> is a potential N catch crop for cold climates. Here, we studied winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> as a catch crop from 2009 to 2011 in Finland. Winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> was either undersown with barley in May or sown after harvesting barley in late July. In two reference treatments, the barley stubble was either left over the winter or ploughed into the soil in autumn. We collected samples from topsoil, 0 - 20  cm, and subsoil, 30 - 50  cm, in early autumn, before snowfall and in the following spring. We measured soil ammonium-N and nitrate-N, and the N content of winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> plants. Results show that undersown winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> did not change the yield and quality of barley. Winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> decreased nitrate-N in the subsoil by 83  % in 2009 and by 61  % in 2010, compared to ploughed barley. By the end of October 2009, winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> undersown in May took up 74  kg N/ha, whereas the crop sown after barley in July took up 57  kg N/ha.

The trait was, however, unstable in subsequent generations. The physical localization of the radish chromosomal region carrying the Rfk 1 gene was investigated using 8 GISH (genomic in situ hybridization) and BAC-FISH (bacterial artificial chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization) methods. The metaphase chromosomes were hybridized using radish DNA as the genomic probe and BAC 64 probe, which is linked with Rfo gene. Both probes showed a signal in the chromosome spreads of the restorer line 4021 - 2 Rfk of <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> {{but not in the}} negative control line 4021 B. The GISH analyses clearly showed that the <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> restorer plants were either monosomic (2 n= 2 x= 20 + 1 R) or disomic (2 n= 2 x= 20 + 2 R) addition lines with one or two copies of a single alien chromosome region originating from radish. In the BAC-FISH analysis, double dot signals were detected in sub-terminal parts of the radish chromosome arms showing that the fertility restorer gene Rfk 1 was located in this additional radish chromosome.

40|$|Factors {{limiting}} barley yield {{have been}} reduced since the Green Revolution globally. Nevertheless, higher yields are pursued with the pressure to feed the increasing human population and domestic animals. However, sustainability can be impaired by the cereal monocultures, in particular, cereal-specific pathogen inocula can increase {{at the cost of}} diversity of soil microfauna. Use of pesticides has selected for resistance in weeds and pathogens. Use of mineral fertilizers has resulted in waste of resources and pollution. In Finland, about half of the arable land is used for continuous cereal production, and barley (Hordeum vulgare), as an important source for food and feed, is the most cultivated cereal crop. In this dissertation, research focused on evaluating the effects of various rotation crops on weeds, pathogenic fungi, soil fertility and yield of subsequent barley. The competitive ability of six crops, namely buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), caraway (Carum carvi), faba bean (Vicia faba), hemp (Cannabis sativa), common vetch (Vicia sativa) and white lupin (Lupinus albus) with weeds was evaluated in glasshouse and field experiments. In the glasshouse experiment, couch grass (Elymus repens) grown with buckwheat accumulated the least dry matter. Activated charcoal was used to exclude the effect of root exudates from donor crops. The results indicated that activated charcoal incorporated in the soil deactivated buckwheat root exudates that apparently inhibited the growth of couch grass. In the field experiment, buckwheat s fast growth and formation of effective leaf area inhibited growth of weeds most effectively among the crops tested. The effect of <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> [Brassica rapa L. ssp. oleifera (DC.) Metzg. ] on several soil pathogenic fungi was evaluated in a field trial in two growing seasons involving five different cultivation regimes: mixed culture of barley and <b>turnip</b> <b>rape,</b> <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> sown after barley, and <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> incorporated as green manure either in autumn or in spring, with continuous barley monoculture as a control. Soil fungal community structure was monitored with capillary-based LH PCR of the ITS region using primers ITS 1 F/ITS 4. The mixed culture and sowing <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> after barley did not significantly decrease the relative abundance of Fusarium spp. Incorporation of <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> plants into the soil, as a source of organic matter and nutrients, was associated with a low relative abundance of Fusarium spp. Fungal diversity was the lowest and the relative abundance of Fusarium spp. the highest in continuous barley. Higher fertilizer application and organic matter incorporation, leading to high fungal diversity, seemed more important in affecting Fusarium spp. than the allelochemicals of <b>turnip</b> <b>rape,</b> as <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> extracts did not detectably inhibit the growth of F. culmorum in an in vitro test. In growth media of different nutrient levels, 10 g soil were suspended in 100 mL sterile water, then 400 μL of the suspended solution was spread on the media of each nutrient level with four replicates. The number of fungal colonies was counted. The soil Fusarium CFU count was higher on nutrient-poor growth medium than on rich medium, supporting the results of field experiments. Results of sequencing indicated that Penicillium spp. might also tolerate low nutrient availability. In two experiments that ran 2010 - 2012 and 2011 - 2013, faba bean, <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> and barley were sown as first crops and their residues were tilled into the soil after harvest in blocks in the first year. In the following year, barley, buckwheat, caraway, faba bean, hemp and white lupin were sown in each block and incorporated either at flowering stage (except barley) or after harvest. Barley yield and grain protein concentration were determined. Mineral N concentrations in the plough layer two months after incorporation of crops and before sowing barley in the following spring were determined. In the third year, all the plots were sown with barley. The beneficial effect of faba bean and <b>turnip</b> <b>rape,</b> as first crops, on yields and grain protein concentration of barley was still detectable in the third year. Barley yields after white lupin, faba bean and hemp, as second crops, were higher than in continuous barley. Barley grain protein concentration was increased after faba bean. In contrast, barley yield and grain protein concentration were not improved after buckwheat and caraway. Incorporation of plants at flowering stage posed a risk of increased N leaching, suggesting that incorporation of plants should be delayed or catch crops should be used during winter to reduce N leaching. The response of barley yields to increased mineralized N from green manure or residues after harvest of rotation crops was significant only in the first experiment conducted in 2010 - 2012 suggesting that increased mineral N in the plough layer has minor influence on barley yield. Thus, rotation with faba bean, white lupin and hemp was beneficial to barley grain yield. In addition, barley grain protein concentration was increased after rotation with faba bean. Weed growth was most strongly suppressed by buckwheat as a complement to current weed management regime, but, rotation with buckwheat and incorporation of its residues did not improve the yield of the successive barley. The effect of glucosinolates of <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> on soil-borne pathogens was outweighed by high fungal bio-diversity suggesting that allelochemicals released from plants sown at a realizable density in the field are unlikely to control pathogens. Maintaining high microbial diversity through sufficient nutrient input is crucial to control pathogenic Fusarium spp. populations.

Lisäksi ohran jyvän proteiinipitoisuus kasvoi viljeltynä härkäpavun jälkeen.

40|$|In organic {{systems in}} France, the yields of WOSR {{are known to}} be low and {{variable}} {{due to the lack of}} references on suitable crop management. The aim of our study was to assess four different crop management strategies for organic WOSR in geo-graphically broad network of farmer’s fields. Theses strategies were built in order to limit the impacts of the main limiting factors, i. e nitrogen / weeds and insects. Experiments comparing the four strategies were performed on a network of farm fields in four contrasted regions over 2 years. This study investi-gated also the potential use of <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> trap crop to control insect pests on organic winter oilseed rape during the third year. The cropping strategies differed in sowing date, crop density and row spacing, in order to use mechanical weeding. Decision rules concerning the utilisation of mechanical harrow were tested. Hypothesis on the effects of each crop management strategy on crop growth, on pests and environmental conditions were formalized and tested. An early sow-ing date decreased the attack of autumn insects and slugs and blackleg incidence. The smothering effect of oilseed rape on weeds depended on the interaction between the sowing date, the amount of available soil nitrogen at crop emergence, the crop density and the soil management. Attack of blossom pollen beetle were more important on <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> than on WOSR but in some cases the trap effect was not sufficient enough to limit pollen beetle damage in WOS...|$|R

40|$|Rotation with {{dicotyledonous}} {{crops to}} break cereal monoculture {{has proven to}} be beneficial to successive cereals. In two fields where the soil had been subjected to prolonged, continuous cereal production, two 3 -year rotation trials were established. In the first year, faba bean, <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> and barley were grown, as first crops, in large blocks and their residues tilled into the soil after harvest. In the following year, barley, buckwheat, caraway, faba bean, hemp and white lupin were sown, as second crops, in each block and incorporated either at flowering stage (except barley) or after harvest. In the third year, barley was grown in all plots and its yield and grain protein concentration were determined. Mineral N in the plough layer was determined two months after incorporation of crops and again before sowing barley in the following year. The effect of faba bean and <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> on improving barley yields and grain protein concentration was still detectable two years after they were grown. The yield response of barley was not sensitive to the growth stage of second crops when they were incorporated, but was to different second crops, showing clear benefits averaging 6 - 7 % after white lupin, faba bean and hemp but no benefit from caraway or buckwheat. The effect of increased N in the plough layer derived from rotation crops on barley yields was minor. Incorporation of plants at flowering stage slightly increased third-year barley grain protein concentration but posed a great potential for N loss compared with incorporation of crop residues after harvest, showing the value of either delayed incorporation or using catch crops...|$|R
50|$|Bagrada hilaris is {{a species}} of shield bug known by the common names bagrada bug and painted bug (See a short video at YouTube). It could be mistaken for or erroneously {{referred}} to as harlequin bug. It is native to Asia. It is known elsewhere as an introduced species, including California and Arizona, where {{it was first reported}} in 2008. It is a major pest insect of Brassica oleracea crops (including cabbage, kale, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli), and related crucifers such as <b>turnips,</b> <b>rape,</b> and mustard. The adult and nymph of the species suck sap from the leaves of the plants, causing wilting, yellowing, and stunting of growth. Besides crucifers, the bugs are known on papaya, sorghum, maize, potato, cotton, caper, pearl millet, and some legumes. Large numbers of the bug congregate on the plants and cause extensive damage.|$|R

No. 21 (Brassica rapa, early type), cv. Husanohana (B. rapa, late type) and cv. Norin No. 20 (B. napus) were investigated using HPLC analysis. Ten GSLs including glucoraphanin, sinigrin, glucoalyssin, napoleiferin, gluconapin, 4 -hydroxyglucobrassicin, glucobrassicanapin, glucobrassicin, and gluconasturtiin were detected. Differences in individual and total GSL contents were found between two plant varieties, which are also depending on various developmental stages. Among the GSLs, gluconapin (mean 23. 11  μmole/g dry weight (DW) and glucobrassicanapin (mean 13. 41  μmole/g DW) documented the most abundant compounds and contributed average 39 and 27 % of the total GSLs, but indolyl and aromatic GSLs together accounted > 10 % of the total GSLs. The presence of significant quantities of gluconapin in the cultivars should be studied more extensively, since the GSL is mainly responsible for the bitter taste...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{represents}} {{an overview of}} cold hardiness research conducted on agricultural and horticultural crops, {{as well as on}} amenity plants in Finland. Inadequate freezing tolerance and/or winter hardiness often prevents introduction of new species and cultivars to Finland. Field observations on winter hardiness and more recently the results from laboratory freezing tests, have assisted breeders to select hardy genotypes. Research approaches for agricultural crops have evolved from observations on winter and frost damage to studies on molecular mechanisms of cold acclimation and freezing injury. The results of experiments on survival of winter cereals, grasses and clovers and frost tolerance of potato and <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> are discussed. The studies conducted on horticultural crops, including apple, strawberry, raspberry, currants, blueberry, sea buckthorn, perennial herbs as well as on ornamental trees and shrubs have included field evaluations of cultivars, or selections for winter hardiness, and studies on the effects of cultural management practices on winter survival. During the last decade detailed studies including controlled freezing tests have provided tools to assist in explanation of the underlying mechanisms of cold hardiness also in horticultural plants. ...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{manuring}} {{is suggested}} {{to be necessary}} in sweet corn cultivation. It is not always possible to use farmyard manure due to economic, production or technical reasons. Catch crops used as green manures can be an alternative source of organic matter. The experiment {{was carried out in}} central-east Poland (52 ° 06 ’N, 22 ° 55 ’E), in years 2008 – 2011. The successive effect of winter catch crops (hairy vetch, white clover, winter rye, Italian ryegrass, winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape)</b> and the type of weed control on the growth and yielding of sweet corn was examined. The catch crops were sown in early September, incorporated in early May. The effect of the winter catch crops on yield was compared to the effect of FYM at a rate of 30 t·ha - 1 and the control without organic manuring. The sweet corn was grown directly after organic fertilization. Three methods of weed control was used: Hw – hand weeding, twice during the growing period, GCM – herbicide Guardian CompleteMix 664 SE, immediately after sowing the seed corn, Z+T – a mixture of herbicides Zeagran 340 SE + Titus 25 WG, in the 3 – 4 leaf stage sweet corn. The highest yields of biomass were found for winter rye (35. 5 t·ha - 1 FM and 7. 3 t·ha - 1 DM), the most of macroelements accumulated winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> (480. 2 kg N+P+K+Ca+Mg·ha- 1). Generally, leguminous catch crops had similar to the FYM and better than non-leguminous catch crops yield-forming effect. The highest yield of marketable ears of sweet corn was obtained after FYM (14. 4 t·ha - 1) and after hairy vetch catch crop (14. 0 t·ha - 1). A similar yield-forming effect also had white clover and Italian ryegrass. The most of ears from 1 ha was achieved after white clover catch crop (59. 3 tausend), similar after FYM and hairy vetch catch crop. The highest kernel yields were found after FYM (10. 7 t·ha - 1). The yields of kernel after hairy vetch and white clover catch crops were significantly higher than after non-leguminous catch crops.

40|$|One way {{to reduce}} {{greenhouse}} gas emissions from the transportation sector is to replace fossil fuels by biofuels. However, production of biofuels also generates greenhouse gas emissions. Energy and greenhouse gas balances of transportation biofuels suitable for large-scale production in Finland have been assessed in this paper. In addition, the use of raw materials in electricity and/or heat production has been considered. The overall auxiliary energy input per energy content of fuel in biofuel production was 3 - 5 -fold {{compared to that of}} fossil fuels. The results indicated that greenhouse gas emissions from the production and use of barley-based ethanol or biodiesel from <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> are very probably higher compared to fossil fuels. Second generation biofuels produced using forestry residues or reed canary grass as raw materials seem to be more favourable in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the use of raw materials in electricity and/or heat production is even more favourable. Significant uncertainties are involved in the results mainly due to the uncertainty of N 2 O emissions from fertilisation and emissions from the production of the electricity consumed or replaced.

40|$|Plants of {{the genus}} Brassica {{comprise}} a remarkably diverse group of crops and encompass varieties that are grown as oilseeds, vegetables, condiment mustards and forages. One of the basic requirements for developing hybrid varieties in oilseed Brassica is the availability of proven heterosis. The development of hybrid cultivars {{has been successful in}} many Brassica spp. Midparent heterosis and high-parent heterosis (heterobeltiosis) have extensively been explored and utilized for boosting various quantity and quality traits in rapeseed. Heterosis is commercially exploited in rapeseed and its potential use has been demonstrated in <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> (B. rapa L.) and Indian mustard (B. juncea L.) for seed yield and most of the agronomic traits. The oilseed rape plant, B. napus, possesses two endogenous male sterile cytoplasms, nap and pol. Ogura type of cytoplasmic male sterility was first discovered in Japanese wild radish and other male-sterile Brassicas (Ogura bearing cytoplasm) derived from interspecific crosses. Information concerning the allelic frequencies of restorers can be useful in trying to understand their evolutionary origins. The ogu, pol and nap cytoplasms of B. napus induce sterility in all, some, and only a few cultivars, respectively.

40|$|Variables for the {{accelerated}} ageing (AA) test, methods for reducing fungal contamination during the AA test, using the conductivity test as a vigour test, {{the effect of}} seed size on seed vigour {{and the relationship between}} laboratory test results and field perfonnance in selected Brassica spp were investigated. In the first experiment, three seed lots of <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> hybrid (B. rapa x campestris), turnip (B. campestris) and forage rape (B. napus); and seven seed lots of Asian rape (B. napus), six seed lots of Asian kale (B. oleraceae var. alboglabra L.) and five seed lots of choisum (B. rapa var. pekinensis) with germinations above 90 % were aged at two different temperatures (41 and 42 °C ± 0. 3 °C) and three ageing times (24, 48 and 72 ± 15 minutes). The second experiment was divided into three sections. In the first, the same seed lots and species were aged at one temperature (41 °C) and time (72 h), but either 40 ml of saturated salts; KCl (83 %RH), NaCl (76 %RH), NaBr (55 %RH); or distilled water (96 %RH) were used as the ageing solutions. In the second, one <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> hyprid seed lot was aged at three temperatures (41, 42 and 45 °C) and two times (72 and 96 h), again using the three saturated salts and distilled water as ageing solutions. In the third, three <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> hybrid seed lots and three Asian kale seed lots were surface sterilised (1 % sodium hypochlorite) prior to ageing at one temperature (41 °C) and time (72 h). In the third experiment, the same species and seed lots used in experiment one at their original seed moisture content (SMC) were tested for conductivity after soaking in deionised water for 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h. They were then re-tested after the SMC had been adjusted to 8. 5 %. In the fourth experiment, three seed lots of forage rape and three seed lots of Asian kale were graded into three seed size categories; large (retained on a 2. 0 mm screen), medium (retained on a 1. 7 mm screen) and small (passed through a 1. 7 mm screen). Graded seeds were then tested for standard germination, AA (41 °C/ 48 h) and conductivity (measured at 16 and 24 h). In the final experiment, the relationships between laboratory tests for the six species (each consisting of three seed lots), field emergence from three sowings, and cold room emergence were evaluated. Both time and temperature influenced post-AA germination. Increasing the ageing period from 48 to 72 hours at 41 °C, and 24 to 48 hours at 42 °C resulted in decreased mean germination percentage for all species but not always clear separation of seed lots. While there were sometimes few differences between ageing at 41 °C and 42 °C, the former is preferred because it is already the temperature used for other species. For Asian <b>rape,</b> choisum and <b>turnip,</b> the previously recommended testing conditions of 41 °C/ 72 h provided good seed lot separation, but for Asian kale and <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> hybrid, AA testing at 41 °C/ 48 h provided better results. Seed moisture content after ageing ranged from 29 - 37 % depending on species. Fungal growth on seeds during the ageing period appeared to reduce post-ageing germination in some seed lots. Substituting saturated salts for distilled water did not stress seed lots in the AA test, due to the lowered RH%, the exception being seed lots 1210 and 1296. For forage and Asian species, seed lot germination mostly remained above 90 % when aged for 72 h at lowered RH%. Increasing the ageing duration from 72 to 96 hours resulted in some decreases in post-AA germination but no clear separation of seed lots. Surface sterilising the seeds prior to the AA test resulted in a lower incidence of contaminant fungi which was associated with a lower percentage of abnormal seedlings. The conductivity test was mostly able to identify vigour differences among forage and Asian vegetable brassica seed lots. Differences in conductivity readings were observed among seed lots in all species. Increasing the period of imbibition resulted in increased conductivity from most seed lots but radicle emergence occurred after 16 - 20 h of imbibition. Variation was observed in the time to reach 95 % maximum of the imbibition curve for most species. Conductivity readings at 16 h would avoid possible influences of radicle emergence on results. Adjusting the SMC to 8. 5 % resulted in reduced variation in conductivity among replicates of seed lots, due to a reduction in imbibition damage. Seed size had a significant effect on both post-AA germination and conductivity results. In forage rape, large size seeds had higher post-AA germination cf. medium cf. small size seeds. In Asian kale, large size seeds had higher post-AA germination compared with small size seeds. For both forage rape and Asian kale, large size seeds had lower conductivity readings cf. small size seeds. The correlation analyses demonstrated significant relationships between AA testing and field emergence parameters (percentage emergence, emergence index and emergence rate). Significant relationships were also observed between conductivity testing and these field emergence parameters. Based on the correlation analysis, AA testing at 41 °C/ 48 hand/or 42 °C/ 48 h could be recommended to be used as an AA test for turnip and Asian rape; and 41 °C/ 48 hand/or 41 °C/ 72 h for Asian kale and choisum. Based on the correlation analysis, conductivity testing at 16 h can be used to predict the field emergence potential of forage and Asian vegetable seed lots. Vigour tests were consistently able to provide better indicators of field perfonnance than the standard germination test, although these relationships did vary with the different field sowings...|$|R

S-metolachlor and its metabolites are commonly found in surface and groundwater close to fields where this molecule is applied. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of crop residues on the interception, retention, degradation and mineralisation of 14 C-S-metolachlor. One bare soil modality, four modalities with cover crop residues from one single species such as winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> (Brassica rapa L. subsp. oleifera), oat (Avena Sativa), red clover (Trifolium rubens L.) and phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifoli L.), one modality with four months aged maize residues (Zea mays L.), and one modality with a mix of residues of four species were used in this study. The crop residues were efficient in intercepting 14 C-S-metolachlor and enhancing its degradation. The fresh cover crop residues were also fixing a large amount of 14 C-S-metolachlor residues under the form of bond residues. This suggests that the presence of cover crops residues could potentially have a beneficial effect and reduce the environmental impact of the S-metolachlor used in agriculture. However, further investigation in the field would be necessary to validate the founding of this study. EI Purpan, INRA Grigno...|$|R
