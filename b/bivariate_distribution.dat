Correlations equal to 1 or −1 correspond to data points lying exactly on a line (in the case of the sample correlation), or to a <b>bivariate</b> <b>distribution</b> entirely supported on a line (in the case of the population correlation).

5000|$|In {{the study}} of probability, given at least two random {{variables}} X, Y, ..., that are defined on a probability space, the joint probability distribution for X, Y, ... is a probability distribution that gives the probability that each of X, Y, ... falls in any particular range or discrete set of values specified for that variable. In the case of only two random variables, {{this is called a}} <b>bivariate</b> <b>distribution,</b> but the concept generalizes to any number of random variables, giving a multivariate distribution.|$|E
5000|$|The {{conditions}} under which regression toward the mean occurs depend {{on the way the}} term is mathematically defined. Sir Francis Galton first observed the phenomenon in the context of simple linear regression of data points. Galton developed the following model: pellets fall through a quincunx forming a normal distribution centered directly under their entrance point. These pellets could then be released down into a second gallery corresponding to a second measurement occasion. Galton then asked the reverse question, [...] "From where did these pellets come?" [...] The answer was not on average directly above. Rather it was on average, more towards the middle, {{for the simple reason that}} there were more pellets above it towards the middle that could wander left than there were in the left extreme that could wander to the right, inwardsA less restrictive approach is possible. Regression towards the mean can be defined for any <b>bivariate</b> <b>distribution</b> with identical marginal distributions. Two such definitions exist. One definition accords closely with the common usage of the term “regression towards the mean”. Not all such bivariate distributions show regression towards the mean under this definition. However, all such bivariate distributions show regression towards the mean under the other definition.|$|E

In this paper we employ copulas and quasi-copulas to find similar best-possible bounds on arbitrary sets of <b>bivariate</b> <b>distribution</b> functions with given margins. As an application, we discuss bounds for a <b>bivariate</b> <b>distribution</b> function H with given margins F and G when {{the values of}} H are known at quartiles of X and Y...|$|E

However, performance is not the only element to con-sider in the selection of a distribution.
