500|$|Three {{distinct}} construction phases {{are evident}} {{on the exterior}} of this pyramid. The first version of this pyramid {{was built in the}} latter half of the 3rd century AD; it was built in a forerunner of the talud-tablero style and had three levels. It stood [...] tall with sides that measured [...] at the base. It featured vertical unframed tableros that were painted black and a stairway flanked by balustrades. The stairway rose at an angle of 49° and projected [...] from the pyramid base. Three more construction phases took place in the Early Classic between AD 300 and 550; none of these three phases supported a masonry superstructure. Each of these phases was very similar, consisting mainly in an increase in the size of the building. Phase 2 had a <b>basal</b> <b>surface</b> area of the base of the third phase covered an area of , this increased to [...] in the fourth construction phase. The second phase of construction took place in the 4th century in a local variation of the talud-tablero style that only included framed tableros on the front of the pyramid, except for the upper level where the tableros extend around all four faces of the structure; it had four stepped levels. The third phase of construction maintained the previous versions talud-tablero variant and had five stepped levels. The fourth version of the pyramid once again had four stepped levels. The fifth phase of construction of this building took place between AD 550 and 700 and involved the construction of a new stairway on top of the previous version, although the older four-level stepped pyramid with talud-tablero sides was retained. The pyramid base now measured [...] on each side. The stairway was widened by covering the balustrades and the pyramid was heightened by [...] by the addition of two more talud-tablero-style levels. This resulted in a base height of a new summit shrine was built upon this, possessing three vaulted rooms and an elaborate roof comb. This construction phase took place around the same time that Temple V was built, the first of the major temples of Tikal, or slightly earlier. The shrine, in its final version, had three access doorways to the first chamber, which was [...] wide.|$|E

The nucleus is wanting. The upper whorls are eroded, the lower ones each contain three spiral lirae, of which the upper one runs at a little distance from the shallow but distinct suture, which is slightly undulate. From the first liration to the second, the shell is slightly convex, this latter liration is strong, prominent and divides the whorls in two subequal parts. Below this liration the shell is concave towards the basal or peripheral liration, which in the upper whorls, runs just in the suture {{and in the last}} one borders the <b>basal</b> <b>surface.</b> These lirations are slightly spinous. Distinct undulating plications run {{from one to the other}} of the lower lirae, with the convex side towards the aperture On the upper part they are directed in an opposite way, being less distinct about halfway the interspace between the upper and median liration. Moreover, the whole shell is covered with much weaker striae, having the character of growth striae and traces of more remote spiral striae. The basal face of the shell is subconvex, but quite flat in the centre, with a shallow groove between the peripheral keel and the first of the basal lirae, this space is rather smooth, though crossed by plicae running from the peripheral spipes in an oblique direction. The outermost of the basal lirae, which is not broad, is followed by two similar ones, about as strong as their interstices, the central ones, five in number, increasing in breadth towards the centre, (one of them nearly double) being larger than the interstices These lirae are connected by small radiating riblets in the interstices. The umbilicus is bordered by a liration, consisting of a row of subquadrate beads This umbilicus is pervious and funnel-shaped. Its wall is radiately striated and has one faint spiral rib. The aperture is rounded-subquadrate. Its right margin is incomplete, its columellar margin is curved, with a denticle in the basal part. It is slightly reflected over the umbilicus. The interior of the shell is nacreous, (the nacreous texture of the inner layers is clearly visible on some of the exterior ...|$|E

The upward curved or stepped margins of <b>basal</b> shear <b>surfaces,</b> here called shear wings, exhibit variable length (ca. 5 ? 30 m long) and inclination. The <b>basal</b> shear <b>surfaces</b> were probably initiated along a bedding-parallel weak horizon, but propagated upward at some point where downslope driving stresses decreased or resisting forces increased. Considering the dimension (ca. 5 ? 30 m long) of the shear wings, the multiple, adjacent concave-up <b>basal</b> shear <b>surfaces</b> {{can be seen as}} a single basal shear plane in most high-resolution subbottom and seismic images because of the limit of acoustic resolution. The multiple contiguous, concave-up <b>basal</b> shear <b>surfaces</b> in each lobe suggest that a submarine landslide lobe probably moved downslope as several sub-blocks in transverse section, rather than as a single unified one. The boundary of the sub-blocks where concave-up <b>basal</b> shear <b>surfaces</b> nearly intersect or overlap with their neighbors marks a zone of differential movement between the sub-blocks, each probably showing very subtle differences in magnitude or speed of downslope movement.

40|$|The <b>basal</b> sliding <b>surfaces</b> {{in large}} rockslides are often {{composed}} of several surfaces and possess a complex geometry. The exact morphology and location {{in three dimensions}} of the sliding surface remains generally unknown, in spite of extensive field and subsurface investigations, such as those at the Åknes rockslide (western Norway). This knowledge is crucial for volume estimations, failure mechanisms, and numerical slope stability modeling. This paper focuses on the geomorphologic characterization of the <b>basal</b> sliding <b>surface</b> of a postglacial rockslide scar {{in the vicinity of}} Åknes. This scar displays a stepped <b>basal</b> sliding <b>surface</b> formed by dip slopes of the gneiss foliation linked together by steeply dipping fractures.

We reacted PbC 12 solution with freshly cleaved muscovite surfaces and found that PbC 12 precipitates were formed on the <b>basal</b> <b>surfaces,</b> steps and edges. It was observed that PbC 12 precipitated preferentially along the steps compared to the <b>basal</b> <b>surfaces</b> and that PbC 12 precipitates at multiple-layer edges were needle-shaped and oriented in different directions. One of the muscovite samples we cleaved had muscovite fragments sitting on the freshly cleaved surfaces. These fragments resulted from previously formed cracks. Thus, {{we were able to}} compare the {{reactivity of}} the weathered surfaces with that of freshly cleaved surfaces. It was found that PbC 12 was not precipitated along the edges of previously cracked muscovite fragments. These results clearly demonstrated that the edges of freshly cleaved muscovite are the most reactive surface sites, whereas the edges of weathered muscovite are not as reactive. We believe that the surface reactivity of the edges of freshly cleaved muscovite is likely due to terminal A 1 -OH~/ 2 ~ or A 1 -OH 1 / 2 [...] groups on these crystalline surfaces, which favor adsorption of Pb 2 + ions and the subsequent nucleation and precipitation reactions. We also investigated the effect of drying rate on the morphology of the surface precipitates.

40|$|As every {{beginning}} {{student of}} histology learns, epithelial cells {{can be classified}} by their shape: columnar cells are tall and nar-row, and cuboidal cells are roughly as tall as they are wide, whereas squamous cells are wide and flat. These polarized cells have distinct apical surfaces (facing the outside world or lumen of an internal cavity or tube), lateral surfaces (facing adjacent cells), and <b>basal</b> <b>surfaces</b> (facing the underlying basement membrane). The relative sizes of these surfaces differ in colum-nar, cuboidal, and squamous cells. For instance, squamous cells have large apical and <b>basal</b> <b>surfaces</b> but small lateral surfaces. Columnar cells are opposite, with large lateral surfaces but small apical and <b>basal</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Though we have {{learned a great deal}} about how epithelial cells develop polarity and their three surfaces, we know very little about how these relative surface areas and the corresponding shapes of the cells are determined. In this issue of The Journal of Cell Biology, Gomez et al. have studied the morphogenesis of the follicular epithelium overly-ing the Drosophila melanogaster ovary. They show that endo-cytosis of the immunoglobulin superfamily cell–cell adhesion protein Fasciclin 2 from the lateral surface is required for cuboi-dal to squamous cell shape transition. The serine/threonine kinase Tao promotes the removal of Fasciclin 2 from the lateral surface and thereby causes the shortening of the lateral surface. In short, Tao is rising as a regulator of cell height. In the lateral surface, there are many cell adhesion mole-cules, such as Fasciclin 2, which form homophilic interactions. Fasciclin 2 was discovered as a molecule critical for growth cone guidance and neural recognition in insects (Bastiani et al., 1987; Harrelson and Goodman, 1988; Snow et al., 1988), and its clustering, internalization, and integration into the synaptic membrane are crucial for synapse remodeling and plasticity.
