5000|$|Multiple basing {{points is}} a method of {{regional}} pricing in milk marketing orders that would allow more than one <b>basing</b> <b>point,</b> or surplus area, to be used. Surplus areas are administratively defined as areas with low Class I utilization, meaning that a relatively {{small percentage of the}} milk produced in an area is used in that area as Class I (fluid) milk. In a multiple <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> system, the order used as the <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> has the smallest Class I differential (the difference between the Class I price and the Class III price). The Class I differential for other orders is then based on transportation costs to the nearest <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> plus the minimum differential.

5000|$|A <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> is a {{geographical}} site {{used to establish}} minimum fluid milk prices for federal milk marketing orders. Generally, minimum fluid farm milk prices increase according to {{the distance from the}} <b>basing</b> <b>point.</b> When federal milk marketing orders began in the 1930s, Eau Claire, Wisconsin was viewed as the principal surplus milk production region in the nation and hence served as the <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> for most milk priced under federal milk marketing orders. Generally, the further a region is from the Upper Midwest, the higher that region’s minimum price for fluid farm milk. Some have argued that there currently are other surplus production regions in the country (e.g., in the northeast and southwest) which should serve as basing points. An attempt by USDA to establish a pricing structure using multiple basing points was thwarted by legislation in 1999.|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of iron in America {{began in a}} limited area east of the Aleghenies, centered around Philadelphia, which was also a principal port of entry for foreign iron. As early as 1750, pricing was done on a rudimentary <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> structure. Apparently, all prices on domestic iron were quoted on a Philadelphia base and {{were higher in the}} outlying territory where the iron was actually made. The manufacturers absorbed freight in order to move their iron to the central market, where it competed with foreign iron. This study will be confined to a discussion of the possible implications of the abandonment of the <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> system of pricing by the steel industry in Utah. For purposes of comparison, a rather detailed discussion of the <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> system will be included, and to clarify the present legal status of delivered pricing, some court history will be summarized. Without doubt, a new pricing policy in the steel industry will have some rather far reaching effects, both on other industries and upon the economy of this region. These possible effects will be discussed. The abandonment of the <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> system of pricing by the steel industry creates many problems as to the adjustments which will be necessary under the new pricing systems. It will be the aim of this sutdy to ascertain the possible nature and extent of these adjustments, and their effect, both upon the Utah steel industry and upon the economy of this area. Since the abandonment of <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> pricing is a rather recent development, this thesis, of necessity, will be in the nature of a prediction as to some of the possible economic implications of this action...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston University, 1950 The Supreme Court {{rendered}} the famous or infamous Cement Decision in June 1948. To many American businessmen {{it was like}} the shot heard around the world. Dislocation of industry was one of the mildest results pictured. 	Time, money and the efforts of many individuals has been spent to inquire into the regional impact on location of the <b>Basing</b> <b>Point</b> Decision. In this thesis I have attempted to examine several regions, namely, New York, New England, Maryland, Cleveland, Chicago, and Pacific Northwest. Feeling that the sum of the whole is equal to its parts, I have attempted to draw conclusions from these rather limited facts. It has been felt that thes give the inquirer a very good sample from which to draw his predictions and conclusions. At all time the following limitations have to be considered: 1. The limitation of time. A problem of this nature needs at least ten years to develop the whole picture. 2. The size of the problem. It is entirely too big to be handled in a master's thesis. The above limitation of time is the only possible excuse, that it can be handled in a master's thesis. 3. The development of the problem has been retarded because of the abnormal market situation with demand being ahead of supply. 	The <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> system is of course an integral part of this problem. What it is and how it came about is explained in Chapters I and II. What the people who make it their business to delve in the realm of theory think is also and integral part of the question. As usual Hegel's dialectic must enter into any theoretical argument. It perhaps took place a little faster than he anticipated it ever doing so. This is an attempt at the third step. The amazing part of the theory seems to be that the two warring camps are not opposed. Rather they seem to agree in their conclusions. The major point of difference is that one feels that relocation is bad for the country, while the other feels {{that in the long run}} it will be good for the country. Those that feel it will be good also feel that centralization will take place and then decentralization, thus creating local monopolies. Those who favor the <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> system feel that these local monopolies will harm and hinder the development of the country in the long run. 	The results of the survey indicate that the overall picture will not be too bad, because the majority of the industry does not work on the <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> system. Those that do have to move, but it seems that the movement will be toward the market rather than away from it. All feel that if there is compulsory f. o. b. mill pricing that it will help their regions. 	From the surveys and the chapter on theory we are able to draw definite conclusions. 	There is a great deal of confusion that is harming the country. It should be cleared up by one of the agencies of the government, that is responsible. 	The results of this so called movement will hamper the small businessman instead of helping him. Instead of increasing competition it will be apt to lessen it. 	There will not be a great shift as was freely predicted. There are numerous reasons for this. The abnormal market situation is holding the shift back. The location fo industry has something more back of it then pricing policy. It is also a combination of various factors of cost. The industry will not locate where delivered costs are cheaper, but where the average costs it the lowest. There is apt to be a shift in the way of establishing brach plants, warehouses etc. There will not be the great building boom predicted because of the required shift in pricing policy. Some regions are apt to be hurt, mainly those that are uneconomic locations in the first place...|$|E
5000|$|In many localities, {{addresses}} often {{increase by}} 100 for each cross street, {{so that the}} building numbers in each block vary {{only in the last}} two digits. In some cities they are consecutive within each block, so that a block where one side is numbered 501, 503, 505, 507, 509, 511 is followed by a block beginning with 601. Generally, within a single city there is a single <b>base</b> <b>point</b> used for all addresses; numbering of all streets therefore reflects its distance from that <b>base</b> <b>point,</b> and directionals (north, south, east, west) are used to refer to buildings on streets which run in that direction and are in that direction from the <b>base</b> <b>point.</b> The numbering system thus resembles a Cartesian coordinate system. Most cities start their numbering from the <b>base</b> <b>point</b> in either single-digits or at 100. For example, if an address is located six blocks north of a city's <b>base</b> <b>point,</b> it would likely be numbered in either the 600 or 700 range and often the designator [...] "north" [...] added to the street name. This is often omitted if the street does not cross beyond the <b>base</b> <b>point</b> or changes names when doing so.|$|R

2500|$|Once a metric {{is given}} on a surface and a <b>base</b> <b>point</b> is fixed, {{there is a}} unique {{geodesic}} connecting the <b>base</b> <b>point</b> to each sufficiently nearby point. The direction of the geodesic at the <b>base</b> <b>point</b> and the distance uniquely determine the other endpoint. These two bits of data, a direction and a magnitude, thus determine a tangent vector at the <b>base</b> <b>point.</b> The map from tangent vectors to endpoints smoothly sweeps out a neighbourhood of the <b>base</b> <b>point</b> and defines {{what is called the}} [...] "exponential map", defining a local coordinate chart at that <b>base</b> <b>point.</b> The neighbourhood swept out has similar properties to balls in Euclidean space, namely any two points in it are joined by a unique geodesic. This property is called [...] "geodesic convexity" [...] and the coordinates are called [...] "normal coordinates". The explicit calculation of normal coordinates can be accomplished by considering the differential equation satisfied by geodesics. The convexity properties are consequences of Gauss's lemma and its generalisations. Roughly speaking this lemma states that geodesics starting at the <b>base</b> <b>point</b> must cut the spheres of fixed radius centred on the <b>base</b> <b>point</b> at right angles. Geodesic polar coordinates are obtained by combining the exponential map with polar coordinates on tangent vectors at the <b>base</b> <b>point.</b> The Gaussian curvature of the surface is then given by the second order deviation of the metric at the point from the Euclidean metric. In particular the Gaussian curvature is an invariant of the metric, Gauss's celebrated Theorema Egregium. A convenient way to understand the curvature comes from an ordinary differential equation, first considered by Gauss and later generalized by Jacobi, arising from the change of normal coordinates about two different points. The GaussJacobi equation provides another way of computing the Gaussian curvature. Geometrically it explains what happens to geodesics from a fixed <b>base</b> <b>point</b> as the endpoint varies along a small curve segment through data recorded in the Jacobi field, a vector field along the geodesic. One and a quarter centuries after Gauss and Jacobi, Marston Morse gave a more conceptual interpretation of the Jacobi field in terms of second derivatives of the energy function on the infinite-dimensional Hilbert manifold of paths.|$|R

This dissertation {{is comprised of}} three essays, the first {{two of which are}} coauthored with Kevin R. Williams. In the first chapter, we develop new empirical methodology to estimate consumer demand and across-market consumer demand heterogeneity when faced with products that have zero sales at the local market level, but have positive sales at the aggregate (national) market level. The absence of sales is a common problem among data sets with a large number of products and this problem is exacerbated when markets are narrowly defined. Observing zero sales creates two major empirical issues. First, standard estimation techniques rely on the Law of Large Numbers in sales. When the Law of Large Numbers does not apply, mechanically forcing the estimation will result in biased demand estimates. Second, failing to account for small sample sizes may create spurious heterogeneity. That is, the randomness generated by small sample sizes may overstate the degree to which demand differs across locations. Alternatively, aggregating over markets to obtain a large sample size will obscure the heterogeneity across local markets. We propose a modification to Berry (1994) and Berry, Levinsohn, Pakes (1995), where both local and aggregate level sales information are used to recover geographically varying demand. This new estimation approach is easy to implement and we will show, using Monte Carlos exercises, that it fits the data well. In the second chapter, we apply this new methodology to examine the welfare benefit of the increased access to variety from online retail. The proliferation of online retail has greatly increased consumers' access to variety. The value of this additional variety depends crucially {{on the extent to which}} local demand can be captured by local retailers. The existing literature has found huge welfare benefits from online variety, but these studies have been limited by national level data. As a result, they are unable to speak to the differences in demand across locations. Using an original data set of online shoe sales, we show that failing to account for across-market heterogeneity can greatly overstate the consumer welfare gain from increases in product variety. In the third chapter, I develop a theory of non-collusive basing-point pricing under Bertrand competition. Basing-point pricing occurs when the delivered prices faced by a consumer is determined by the consumer's distance from a common location, known as the <b>basing</b> <b>point.</b> That is, the price faced by the consumer is equal to the price charged by firms at the <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> plus the cost of transportation from the <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> to the consumer's location regardless of the actual location of the selling firm. The existing non-collusive theories of basing-point pricing rely on the exploitation of market power by non-basing point firms to obtain the basing-point result. I show that basing-point pricing is consistent with Bertrand competition by non-basing point firms when these firms face increasing marginal costs of production or capacity constraints...|$|E

40|$|Economic {{authors have}} {{underlined}} the deep inroads of economic thinking into competition ( EU ) and antitrust ( US ) policies. Analysing the 70 s and 80 s, some have {{gone so far}} as to refer to this phenomenon as a ?revolution? (Kwoka & White [1989] ; Dumez [1990]). Prima facie, they cannot be dismissed. The economics vocabulary and concepts, even when used as rhetoric (McCloskey [1994]), has pervaded in competition and antitrust literature. The various economic criteria set forward in guidance or consultative documents such as ?greenpapers? in the EU or ?guidelines? in the US is another example. Yet a fair deal of renowned microeconomists remain skeptical. They stress that microeconomics develops according to its own academic agenda, increasingly losing touch with the practicalities of the markets. The academic analytical tools become more and more complex and do not provide with straight answers. But what could really be said about the status of economics in the antitrust decision making process? What can economists claim from their involvement in such matters? To tackle these issues, some distance with the current debates is necessary. Only an historical approach will provide the means to put into perspective the impact of antitrust economic analysis and controversies on the dynamic of markets. Also, concentrating on a particular industry will enable to avoid generalities. The paper selects the cement industry as an empirical material. The focus is made on two important topics in industrial economics: pricing, with the <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> system antitrust case which has arisen in the US in the late 30 s and along the 40 s (Supreme Court decision, 1948); and industry structure, with the antitrust case on vertical integration which has run along the 60 s (?Statement of general policy enforcement?, Federal Trade Commission [1967]).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} performance of the Liberian iron ore industry from 1950 - 1985 and its viability in global markets, assuming stagnation (World Bank) and expansionist (Leontief et al.) expectations. It examines past trends in trade and investment patterns in the light of equilibrium allocations which imply the existence of efficient transportation links. This model assumes that given world sources and sinks as constrained by the supply and demand structure of the ore industry, each individual region acts as a <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> to maximize net social payoff from its ore trade. The model is validated on recent (1984) industry data and "explains" 91 % of actual demands and 79 % of actual trade flows. Price discrimination is evidenced in the form both of monopsony power exercised by some buyers in the Pacific Basin over intra-regional (e. g., Australian) and extra-regional (e. g., Brazilian, Liberian) producers and monopoly power permitting modest rents to be collected by some producers in Africa, including Liberia, from the European markets. In North America, rents appear for some domestic producers in some simulations. These results confirm quantitatively the descriptive results of others while postulating a much more competitive environment for producers. The model assumes world trade doubles through year 2000 or stagnates. Liberia fares poorly in either case, losing significant portions of its U. S. and of its EEC markets to Canada and Brazil respectively despite the maintenance of some resource rents globally. This analysis quantifies {{for the first time the}} claims of earlier studies that price discrimination exists, but indicates actual prices may be closer to long-run competitive prices than has generally been assumed by others. Thus, realistic ways for Liberia to increase its market shares require not only an expansion of the industrialized countries' steel industries but an aggressive willingness to absorb transport and other costs by foregoing rents and lowering costs. Removing diseconomies of small transport scale, absorbing freight, and lower U. S. exchange rates combined with world steel expansion could increase Liberian annual shipments by as much as 50 million tonnes per year or $ 1 billion annually...|$|E
40|$|This book is {{an essay}} in deconstruction, the point {{of which is to}} explain how it is that {{concepts}} of public debt that that are relevant for monarchical regimes are not relevant for democratic regimes. While our analysis incorporates several analytical tools not found in other works on political economy and public debt, it also recurs to some significant, mainly Italian forerunners. For one thing, our distinction between mythical and realistic thinking recurs to James Burnham’s (1943) examination of several seminal thinkers in The Machiavellians. Those thinkers started with Niccolo Machiavelli and included such Italian thinkers from the early 20 th century as Gaetano Mosca, Roberto Michels, and Vilfredo Pareto, all of whom treated politics realistically as a struggle for power, in contrast to treating politics idealistically and mythically as promoting some abstract notion of universal interest. In addition to the authors Burnham examined, we give special attention to some Italian theorists of public finance from the late- 19 th and early 20 th centuries, particularly Antonio de Viti de Marco. De Viti in particular set forth a framework for political economy and public debt that avoided both of flaws that have infected contemporary thinking about public debt and political economy. Indeed, this book mostly entails our revisiting de Viti’s body of work while integrating some contemporary analytical contributions and formulations into de Viti’s analytical framework. What results is the different understanding of public debt and political economy that we set forth here. We develop our analysis in six chapters. Chapter 1 sets forth the conventional macro-theoretic framework within which fiscal policy and public debt is typically presented. There are significant points of controversy among macro theorists, as illustrated by controversy among Keynesians and monetarists. All the same, those theorists all work within the same framework of aggregative economics to develop their claims about macroeconomic guidance. Chapter 2 explores questions regarding just who it is that supplies the macro guidance that is envisioned in the macro theories. The answer to this question is highly relevant for a political economy of public debt. At one analytical extreme, guidance is provided by some anointed individual, perhaps a macro czar. At the other extreme, guidance is provided by “the people,” as a democratic platitude. In between those extremes lie the Machiavellian-inspired theories where the few dominate and guide the many. Chapter 3 asks the reader to think about whether an aggregate economy is better construed as an engine or as an ecological system. By treating it as an engine, economists can pretend to be mechanics. Once an economy is recognized to be a complex ecological system, the mythology of global governance gives way to the reality of multiple sources of local governance. For democracies there is no person who can reasonably be described as making choices for the regime. Instead, choices emerge out of processes of interaction among collections of people. Chapter 4 establishes an analytical benchmark of a democratic system in which political outcomes reflect genuine consensus among the participants. This benchmark traces to de Viti, and should be regarded as a benchmark or <b>basing</b> <b>point</b> and not a description of reality. De Viti recognized that democratic regimes were not passive reflectors of individual preference orderings because they entailed relationships of domination-and-subordination. Chapter 5 thus moves from the benchmark condition of a cooperative democracy to a realistic treatment of democracy where there exist islands of political power within a relatively passive sea of generally modest democratic participation. This chapter explains that descriptions of democracy as entailing self-governance are typically mythical or ideological formulations that promote the purposes of those who work with such notions. Chapter 6 closes the book by exploring how public debt is a troubling practice for republican and democratic regimes because of its ability to corrupt the language and practice of political economy. For instance, the idea of contract is a perfectly good and sensible concept to apply to the private ordering of economic interaction. When that term is extended to public ordering outside the hypothetical construction of a cooperative state, it becomes a piece of ideology that obscures the role of public debt in promoting the interests of politically dominant groups within society. This chapter concludes by giving brief consideration to some implications of our analysis for democratic reform, though our primary interest in this book lies in analysis and not in reform...|$|E
