25|$|For two days, {{her crew}} labored to restore her to order {{and make the}} {{necessary}} repairs. Having done everything within his means to restore Tunny to normal operating condition, her commanding officer found her still short of combat readiness. Her bow planes, despite all efforts, were still inoperative; her bow <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tank</b> unusable; and various other problems, {{which could not be}} remedied at sea, remained. Thus, on 29 August 1943, she departed her patrol area leaving these hunting grounds to other submarines in better condition. The war-scarred submarine moored at Pearl Harbor on 8 September.|$|E
500|$|Built by the Kawasaki Dockyard Co. {{at their}} {{shipyard}} in Kobe, I-179 was laid down on 21 August 1941 {{under the name}} of Submarine No. 157 and renamed I-179 on 1 November 1941. The boat was launched on 16 July 1942 and completed on 18 June 1943. While conducting her sea trials in the Inland Sea on 14 July, she sank with the loss of all 85 officers and crewmen. Her wreck was located four days later at a depth of [...] at [...] with several hatches and her bow <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tank</b> vent valve open. I-179 was struck from the Navy List on 15 April 1944. Her wreck was salvaged from April 1956 to 1 March 1957 and scrapped at Kure.|$|E
2500|$|Weightlessness {{can also}} be {{simulated}} by creating the condition of neutral buoyancy, in which human subjects and equipment are placed in a water environment and weighted or buoyed until they hover in place. [...] NASA uses neutral buoyancy to prepare for extra-vehicular activity (EVA) at its Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory. [...] Neutral buoyancy is also used for EVA research at the University of Maryland's Space Systems Laboratory, which operates the only neutral <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tank</b> at a college or university.|$|E
50|$|After {{the well}} is drilled, {{the water is}} pumped out of the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tanks</b> and the vessel is re-floated and towed to the next location.|$|R
60|$|The flier reeled half over; {{the engine}} stopped; as one, the patched <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tanks</b> burst, and we plunged, headforemost, {{to the ground}} twenty feet beneath.|$|R
50|$|An Adventuress is solidly {{constructed}} of GRP. The bilge keels are formed {{as an integral}} part of the hull, and create dynamic and directional stability - they do not contain ballast. The hull and deck mouldings are complemented by inner mouldings that create built-in <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tanks</b> at bow and stern and along each side. Originally these <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tanks</b> had no external access, although some owners will have added hatches and bungs to make these accessible for stowage and to help the hull breathe when in storage.|$|R
2500|$|Pisces III, a Canadian {{commercial}} submersible, {{was used}} to lay transatlantic telephone cable on the sea bottom off Ireland in 1973. When a <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tank</b> was inadvertently flooded, it sank {{to the bottom of}} the ocean with its two-man crew, Britons Roger Mallinson and Roger Chapman, stranded at a depth of [...] and 72 hours of available life support, which they were able to extend to 76 hours by careful conservation. Initial rescue efforts by Pisces III sister submersibles were unsuccessful. Through an international effort of the United States, Canada, and England, CURV-III was deployed within 24 hours 6,000 miles from its home base. Deployment of CURV-III from CCGS John Cabot was hampered by heavy sea conditions. Rapid repairs were made when CURV-III’s gyroscope failed and electronics shorted-out after green water came aboard the Cabot. Assisted by the submersibles Pisces II and Pisces V, CURV-III was able to attach lines to the Pisces III hatch. The Cabot raised CURV-III at [...] per minute until their lines entangled. [...] The lines were cut, CURV-III was abandoned, and Pisces III was floated to [...] where scuba divers were able to attach lines that were used to lift Pisces III the rest of the way to the surface. CURV-III performed the deepest underwater rescue in history when Pisces III’s two-man crew was rescued after 76 hours with just minutes of air remaining.|$|E
5000|$|In SDC Verifier it is {{possible}} to apply complicated loads: <b>buoyancy,</b> <b>tank</b> ballast and wind.|$|E
50|$|The unusual {{configuration}} of the bow <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tank</b> creates a generous amount of stowage space under the foredeck for paddles, buckets, fishing gear, etc.|$|E
60|$|The Heliumite now {{gave his}} {{attention}} to his injured craft. A close examination revealed {{the fact that one}} of the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tanks</b> had been punctured, but the engine itself was uninjured.|$|R
60|$|The black's next {{shot was}} more accurate, {{striking}} my flier full upon the prow and exploding with the instant of contact, ripping wide open the bow <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tanks</b> and disabling the engine.|$|R
50|$|Piccard's second bathyscaphe was {{actually}} a third vessel Trieste, which was purchased by the United States Navy from Italy in 1957. It had two water ballast <b>tanks</b> and eleven <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tanks</b> holding 120,000 litres of gasoline.|$|R
50|$|This GRP {{model was}} {{introduced}} in 1987, combining the structural improvements of the Mark II with greater storage space in the bow. A horizontal bulkhead divides the bow <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tank,</b> and both {{the upper and lower}} sections have large access hatches creating secure stowage spaces.|$|E
50|$|A neutral {{buoyancy}} pool or neutral <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tank</b> is {{a pool of}} water in which {{neutral buoyancy}} is used to train astronauts for extravehicular activity and the development of procedures. These pools began {{to be used in the}} 1960s and were initially just recreational swimming pools; dedicated facilities would be built later.|$|E
50|$|Kabalega was a train ferry. Her cook, George Saka, {{reported}} that at about 0300 hrs. Kaawa struck Kabalegas bow, dislodging the railway wagons that were secured to Kabalegas deck into the water. Saka told Uganda's New Vision newspaper that the collision tore open Kabalegas bow and also ruptured her #8 <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tank</b> and water also rapidly entered the #9 tank.|$|E
60|$|Her stern <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tanks</b> {{prevented}} her dropping {{with great}} rapidity; but Thurid was firing rapidly now {{in an attempt}} to burst these also, that I might be dashed to death in the swift fall that would instantly follow a successful shot.|$|R
60|$|The flier upon whose deck Dejah Thoris and I found {{ourselves}} after twelve {{long years of}} separation proved entirely useless. Her <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tanks</b> leaked badly. Her engine would not start. We were helpless there in mid air above the arctic ice.|$|R
60|$|But {{even this}} meagre {{satisfaction}} {{was soon to}} be denied him, for presently the flier commenced to sag toward the port and by the bow. The damage to the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tanks</b> had evidently been more grievous than he had at first believed.|$|R
50|$|The amphibious {{excavator}} {{can walk}} or work in water, because the chassis crawler floats on sealed pontoons. It may swing or even roll over when excavating with no support underneath. It moves using a dual-body boat form <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tank.</b> A reducer drives the crawler chain, allowing free and smooth movement. Its upper structure is a modified excavator that allows 360° full rotation and hydraulic operation.|$|E
50|$|The Saunders-Roe SR.N4 (Saunders-Roe Nautical 4), {{otherwise}} known as the Mountbatten-class, was the biggest hovercraft to have been completed upon its introduction. Its primary structure comprised a large modular <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tank,</b> the internal structure of which being divided into 24 watertight compartments. It had an identical platform shape to the smaller SR.N5, being rectangular with a semi-circular bow and a length-to-beam ratio of 1:1.66.|$|E
50|$|Neutral {{buoyancy}} is {{used extensively}} in training astronauts {{in preparation for}} working in the microgravity environment of space. NASA and the Russian space program maintain facilities in which suited astronaut trainees interact with mock-up space hardware, {{with the assistance of}} scuba divers. At the University of Maryland's Space Systems Laboratory, a neutral <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tank</b> is similarly used to evaluate the performance of prototype space robots.|$|E
50|$|The 470 is {{a strict}} one-design class, and its builder must be {{approved}} a Licensed Builder by World Sailing. The class design may evolve, but its intent is to use proven, economical, and environmentally sound materials, currently fibreglass with integral <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tanks</b> for the hull.|$|R
50|$|The Illusion is a one-design, single-handed keelboat {{based on}} {{the lines of a}} 12-metre yacht. Its {{features}} include foot pedal steering, genoa roller reefing, full trimming facilities, large <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tanks,</b> and car-top mounting. It was designed by Jo Richards and Neil Graham in 1981.|$|R
60|$|Thurid was {{the first}} to reach it, and with the agility of a monkey clambered swiftly to the boat's deck, where a touch of the button {{controlling}} the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tanks</b> sent the craft slowly upward, though not with the speed that marks the well-conditioned flier.|$|R

50|$|Much of the {{wreckage}} found was washed ashore near Port Burwell, Ontario, including one intact unused lifeboat, and the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tanks</b> from a second lifeboat. The last lifeboat {{was found in the}} Spring of 1910, broken in two on the rocks of the Buffalo harbor breakwater.|$|R
50|$|The {{variants}} in {{the design}} of the coypu depend on the builder. The hull is normally glass-reinforced plastic construction, with <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tanks</b> on front, sides, and rear. The centreboard is metal, and the rudder is removable, either fixed (i.e. does not have a downhaul) or with a moveable blade.|$|R
50|$|The Saunders-Roe SR.N1 ("Saunders-Roe Nautical 1"), {{initially}} {{known as}} the Model A, was the world's first full-sized hovercraft. It was controlled from a small cab placed just forward of the cylindrical center piece set {{into the middle of}} the deck which contained the craft's engine and horizontally mounted fan. For aerodynamic efficiency, the fan and the wall of the center piece had very little clearance, while the exterior wall of the center piece itself was heavily reinforced so that the crew would be protected in the event of a catastrophic engine failure. The core of the vehicle was a rivetted aircraft-grade aluminium alloy sheet <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tank,</b> which had been coated with a thin layer of pure aluminium to protect against corrosion.|$|E
5000|$|The Lake design, S-2, was a {{modified}} double hull type, with ballast tanks {{wrapped around the}} inner pressure hull. The stern ended in a flat [...] "shovel" [...] shape which gave the stern needed buoyancy. The rudder was mounted beneath the stern and the pivot structure also supported the stern diving planes. To gain surface buoyancy, the superstructure atop the boat was partially watertight. Sea trials showed that the bow tended to burrow into the waves so Lake added a <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tank</b> to the bow, which gave it a humped appearance. This boat suffered from poor maneuverability and was overcomplicated. It proved to be unreliable and was not well liked by its crew. The Navy did not choose it for mass production and no further boats were produced to this design.|$|E
50|$|The Space Systems Laboratory (SSL) {{is part of}} the Aerospace Engineering Department and A. James Clark School of Engineering at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland. The Space Systems Laboratory is {{centered}} on the Neutral Buoyancy Research Facility, a 50 ft, 25 ft neutral buoyancy pool used to simulate the microgravity environment of space. The only such facility housed at a university, Maryland's neutral <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tank</b> is used for undergraduate and graduate research at the Space Systems Lab. Research in Space Systems emphasizes space robotics, human factors, applications of artificial intelligence and the underlying fundamentals of space simulation. There are currently five robots being tested, including Ranger, a four-armed satellite repair robot, and SCAMP, a six-degree of freedom free-flying underwater camera platform. Ranger was funded by NASA starting in 1992, and was to be a technological demonstration of orbital satellite servicing. NASA was never able to manifest it for launch and the program was defunded circa 2006. For example, Ranger development work at the SSL continues, albeit at a slower pace; Ranger was used to demonstrate robotic servicing techniques for NASA's proposed robotic Hubble Servicing Mission.|$|E
50|$|Early boats, wooden and GRP, used {{buoyancy}} bags fixed {{under the}} benches and thwarts for internal buoyancy but nowadays foam reinforced plastic boats have built in <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tanks</b> improving stiffness and removing {{much of the}} maintenance associated with air-filled bags. Wooden boats still tend to have buoyancy bags to the rear and a forward bulkhead.|$|R
2500|$|The J/22 has a {{comfortable}} self-bailing cockpit with 7ft. long seats and room for 4 {{people in the}} cabin to escape the rain or cold. [...] J/22 is built for safety with <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tanks</b> and offshore hatches. Her 700lb. lead keel lowers the center of gravity, creating nearly 1700 foot pounds of righting moment at 90 degrees of heel.|$|R
2500|$|Fort Worth {{includes}} additional stability improvements {{over the}} original Freedom design; the stern transom was lengthened and <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tanks</b> {{were added to}} the stern to increase weight service and enhance stability. [...] The ship will also feature automated sensors to allow [...] "conditions-based maintenance" [...] and reduce crew overwork and fatigue issues that Freedom had on her first deployment.|$|R
