5|$|At {{this time}} the 12th Light Horse Regiment was in the Judean Hills {{on the front line}} near Kuddis, where the {{disposition}} of the Ottoman defenders was static and quiet, but observant. From 12 December the regiment was working to extend a sangar and enjoyed fresh meat, bread, vegetables, and rum. On 17 December bivouac sheets and blankets arrived. The weather continued cold and showery, but the good rations and extra <b>blankets</b> <b>and</b> bivouac shelters lifted morale.|$|E
5|$|Bilis and its {{associated}} flooding left over 400,000people homeless, and over 2million more had to be evacuated {{in the face of}} rising waters. Following the storm, the Red Cross Society of China provided food, <b>blankets,</b> <b>and</b> water purification kits to over 100,000 Hunan residents in mass evacuation shelters. The relief effort was complicated by an earthquake in Yunnan, as well as three more tropical cyclones: Typhoon Kaemi, Typhoon Prapiroon, and Typhoon Saomai. All of the storms were stronger than Bilis, and exacerbated flooding and other problems in the region.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{structurally}} efficient configurations for wing-type solar arrays are {{developed by a}} combination of deepening the planform of the <b>blanket</b> <b>and</b> structure and by partitioning the <b>blanket</b> with battens <b>and</b> frequent attachments to the support structure. This technique reduces the tension required to avoid a low natural frequency for the <b>blanket,</b> <b>and</b> the load reduction results in a lighter structure. The use of three different structures are investigated: the Astromast, the Extendible Support Structure (ESS), and a new beam called the STACBEAM (Stacking Triangular Articulated Compact Beam) and their relative performances are compared. The investigation of the STACBEAM is emphasized because its sequential deployment is more reliable for very long systems, and its linear deployment facilitates local attachments to the <b>blanket</b> <b>and</b> the development of a low mass deployer...|$|R

5|$|On May 11, {{two days}} after the cyclone had hit, the Indian Government {{launched}} a massive relief and rescue operation. The Indian Army and Naval helicopters took surveys of areas affected by the cyclone, and also dropped food packets. Although the Indian Government did not request international assistance, the Red Cross provided food, oil, medicines and water tanks for the affected families; the wcc/cicarws issued an appeal for $ (1990USD) so they could provide immediate needs with World Vision providing $ (1990USD) for food <b>blankets</b> <b>and</b> utensils.|$|E
5|$|The floods {{also hit}} the Church of England primary school, with the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service {{evacuating}} pupils and staff {{from the school}} in life rafts. The evacuation used four rafts, rescuing pupils and teachers from the school through windows. The 165 people (140 pupils and 25 members of staff) were taken uphill to the parish hall, where <b>blankets</b> <b>and</b> sleeping bags had been provided.|$|E

5|$|Vehicle {{camouflage}} techniques {{begin with}} paint, which offers at best only limited effectiveness. Other methods for stationary land vehicles include covering with improvised {{materials such as}} <b>blankets</b> <b>and</b> vegetation, and erecting nets, screens and soft covers which may suitably reflect, scatter or absorb near infrared and radar waves. Some military textiles and vehicle camouflage paints also reflect infrared to help provide concealment from night vision devices.|$|E
5|$|As a leader, Patton {{was known}} to be highly critical, {{correcting}} subordinates mercilessly for the slightest infractions, but also being quick to praise their accomplishments. Although he garnered a reputation as a general who was both impatient and impulsive and had little tolerance for officers who had failed to succeed, he fired only one general during World War II, Orlando Ward, and only after two warnings, whereas Bradley sacked several generals during the war. Patton reportedly had the utmost respect for the men serving in his command, particularly the wounded. Many of his directives showed special trouble to care for the enlisted men under his command, and he was well known for arranging extra supplies for battlefield soldiers, including <b>blankets</b> <b>and</b> extra socks, galoshes, and other items normally in short supply at the front.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} kept as pets, cats are also used in the {{international}} fur and leather industries for making coats, hats, <b>blankets</b> <b>and</b> stuffed toys; and shoes, gloves and musical instruments respectively (about 24 cats are {{needed to make a}} cat fur coat). This use has now been outlawed in the United States, Australia, and the European Union. Cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practise of witchcraft, and are still made into blankets in Switzerland as folk remedies believed to help rheumatism. In the Western intellectual tradition, the idea of cats as everyday objects have served to illustrate problems of quantum mechanics in the SchrÃ¶dinger's cat thought experiment.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of all four cyclones, the Cook Islands {{requested}} international assistance. Funding to repair damages from the storms reached $7.87million. The Red Cross provided relief items, such as <b>blankets</b> <b>and</b> lanterns worth $35,200; the Pacific Forum provided food, fuel, and logistical support worth $32,000; the Government of China donated $19,200 in post-disaster funds; $32,000 in funding {{was provided by the}} United Nations Development Programme; contributions from the Australian Agency for International Development and the New Zealand Agency for International Development amounted to $862,570, consisting of fuel, shelter, relief items, and disaster funds; the Government of Australia provided $128,000 wort of fuel and equipment; lastly, the Government of France deployed military teams with recovery supplies and tents. The European Union also supplied Â£200,000 ($280,000) in relief funds.|$|E
5|$|Landing safely on the Moon, {{the astronomers}} {{get out of}} the capsule (without the need of space suits) and watch the Earth rise in the distance. Exhausted by their journey, they unroll their <b>blankets</b> <b>and</b> sleep. As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star, old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a {{snowfall}} that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella; it promptly takes root and turns into a giant mushroom itself.|$|E
5|$|Navajo {{textiles}} {{were originally}} utilitarian blankets {{for use as}} cloaks, dresses, saddle <b>blankets,</b> <b>and</b> similar purposes. Toward {{the end of the}} 19th century, weavers began to make rugs for tourism and export. Typical Navajo textiles have strong geometric patterns. They are a flat tapestry-woven textile produced in a fashion similar to kilims of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, but with some notable differences. In Navajo weaving, the slit weave technique common in kilims is not used, and the warp is one continuous length of yarn, not extending beyond the weaving as fringe. Traders from the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged adoption of some kilim motifs into Navajo designs.|$|E
