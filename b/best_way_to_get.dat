Nao concluded that the tunnel would provide the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{in and out of}} the American area, but using it also presented challenges. The sewerage tunnel contained both wastes and toxic oils which could cause blindness, so Nao and his men would have to close their eyes as they move through the tunnel, in order to avoid blindness. Furthermore, Nao and his men must wash their bodies to get rid of the deadly odours to avoid detection, and probably arrest, by South Vietnamese authorities. After Nao had surveyed the tunnels which lead into the port, he presented his plan of attack to the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters. Nao decided to utilise high explosives, enough to sink a ship, and detonate it using a timer so that his men could get away safely. Nao’s superiors approved the plan, and they ordered him to launch the attack before sunrise to avoid killing local Vietnamese civilians.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} factors that promote {{circular}} migration. Modern forms of transport and communication, increased social networks, {{and the growth}} of international corporations all contribute to the growing phenomena. Advances in transportation have reduced the time and money necessary to travel between locations, making it easier for migrants to return home more frequently {{and in the case of}} an emergency. New methods of communication facilitate closer connections with the migrants’ homes than before. Border-crossing social networks are especially important to the success of migrants. Through these networks, migrants are able to help each other by providing information about where to go, the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> jobs, where to live, etc., helping them to overcome many of the costs and barriers of entry. Furthermore, through these social networks, workers are able to keep up with families, economic activities, political interests, and individual cultures. This also contributes to the self-perpetuating nature of circular migration. With each return visit, migrants learn more about work, housing, and the process of migration itself. These social relationships and experiences, referred to as “migration-specific capital”, lower the risk and costs of moving and improve the changes of success.|$|E

500|$|When Alberta and Saskatchewan {{were made}} provinces in 1905, the federal {{government}} retained control over their lands and natural resources, which made the new provinces unique in Canada. [...] The Rutherford government acquiesced to this state of affairs; because the terms of confederation had been drawn up by the Liberal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, it was natural for the provincial Liberal Party to cast itself as their defender.

500|$|Writing about Lee's {{style and}} use of humor in a tragic story, scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin states: [...] "Laughter... the {{gangrene}} under the beautiful surface but also by demeaning it; one can hardly... be controlled by what one is able to laugh at." [...] Scout's precocious observations about her neighbors and behavior inspired National Endowment of the Arts director David Kipen to call her [...] "hysterically funny". To address complex issues, however, Tavernier-Courbin notes that Lee uses parody, satire, and irony effectively by using a child's perspective. After Dill promises to marry her, then spends too much time with Jem, Scout reasons the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him {{to pay attention to}} her is to beat him up, which she does several times. Scout's first day in school is a satirical treatment of education; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write, and forbids Atticus from teaching her further. Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony, however, as Jem and Scout try to understand how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society. [...] Satire and irony are used {{to such an extent that}} Tavernier-Courbin suggests one interpretation for the book's title: Lee is doing the mocking—of education, the justice system, and her own society—by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval.|$|E

[...] Johnny Dee of Classic Rock expressed, [...] "The later material here sounds formulaic, however, new song [...] "Tell Me Where It Hurts" [...] adds strings to the dynamic and sits well alongside their peerless early material".

[...] Kerrang! magazine's Tom Byrant also felt that Garbage's work had dated, expounding, [...] "Something that was once {{so much a part of}} the Zeitgeist has remained rooted to the era it marked, untranslatable across the millennial divide. Still, songs like 'Stupid Girl' and 'Only Happy When It Rains' [...] maintain an urgency and spite that sees their intent remain intact." [...] Billboard writer Kerri Mason praised the choice of remixes on the special edition: [...] "the band continually brought the best of dance's best producers, not one of the thirteen tracks is a throwaway." [...] Ben Hogwood of musicOMH called the compilation a [...] "deserved retrospective", further noting that [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to know Garbage is through their albums, which demonstrate their strength in depth.

The CCD-based spectrometer device with the wavelength range of 400 - 550 nm is used to detection the spectrum emitted from the plasma.
