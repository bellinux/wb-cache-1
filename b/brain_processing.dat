25|$|Lesions rarely are {{localized}} and {{can affect}} {{large areas of}} the <b>brain.</b> <b>Processing</b> in the brain is generally not localized and requires many areas of the brain to process. Furthermore, lesioning may interfere with pathways that span the lesion site. Thus, lesions are not always a good way to determine what specific brain areas do. Therefore, a degree of skepticism should be kept in mind when viewing lateralization data from lesion studies.|$|E

Likewise, some modern compatibilists in psychology have tried to revive traditionally accepted struggles of free will with the formation of character. Compatibilist free will has also been attributed to our natural sense of agency, where one must believe they are an agent in order to function and develop a theory of mind.|$|E
40|$|Speech and {{language}} are largely lateralized {{to the left}} cerebral hemisphere, while pragmatic competence appears to require an intact right hemisphere. Speech {{is known to be}} decoded in the brain by mechanisms engaging cortical areas within the left hemisphere, yet language experience may influence which brain circuitry is employed in processing auditory cues. The <b>brains</b> <b>processing</b> of information involves simultaneous activation of widely distributed neural networks. These networks allow large-scale parallel processing but also include points of convergence and sequential routing. The distribution and the time course of the momentary brain electric field topography offer a unique possibility to obtain insights into important features of the <b>brains</b> <b>processing</b> of information. The sequence of brain electric field topography represents the shift {{of the state of the}} brain from a representation of the input to a representation of the output...|$|R

25|$|The time {{resolution}} needed depends on <b>brain</b> <b>processing</b> time for various events. An {{example of the}} broad range here is given by the visual processing system. What the eye sees is registered on the photoreceptors of the retina within a millisecond or so. These signals get to the primary visual cortex via the thalamus in tens of milliseconds. Neuronal activity related to the act of seeing lasts for more than 100ms. A fast reaction, such as swerving to avoid a car crash, takes around 200ms. By about half-a-second, awareness and reflection of the incident sets in. Remembering a similar event may take a few seconds, and emotional or physiological changes such as fear arousal may last minutes or hours. Learned changes, such as recognizing faces or scenes, may last days, months, or years. Most fMRI experiments study brain processes lasting a few seconds, with the study conducted over some tens of minutes. Subjects may move their heads during that time, and this head motion needs to be corrected for. So does drift in the baseline signal over time. Boredom and learning may modify both subject behavior and cognitive processes.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{of the eye}} {{movements}} in “rapid eye movement” sleep are in fact less rapid than those normally exhibited by waking humans. They are also shorter in duration {{and more likely to}} loop back to their starting point. About seven of such loops take place over one minute of REM sleep. In slow-wave sleep the eyes can drift apart; however, the eyes of the paradoxical sleeper move in tandem. These eye movements follow the ponto-geniculo-occipital waves originating in the brain stem. The eye movements themselves may relate to the sense of vision experienced in the dream, but a direct relationship remains to be clearly established. Congenitally blind people, who do not typically have visual imagery in their dreams, [...] still move their eyes in REM sleep. An alternative explanation suggests that the functional purpose of REM sleep is for procedural memory processing, and the rapid eye movement is only a side effect of the <b>brain</b> <b>processing</b> the eye-related procedural memory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCIs) {{provide a}} non-muscular channel to {{communicate}} with the outside world by means of brain activity. A crucial step for efficient BCI operation is <b>brain</b> signal <b>processing</b> methods. Most BCI systems for humans use scalp recorded electroencephalographic activity, whereas Electrocorticography (ECoG) is a minimally-invasive alternative to electroencephalogram (EEG), providing higher and superior signal characteristics allowing rapid user training and faster communication. Its efficiency is based on <b>brain</b> signal <b>processing</b> methods that classify brain signal patterns in different tasks accurately. Artifacts in raw brain signal make it necessary to pre-process signals for feature extraction.

Studying the vast literature considering the various aspects of <b>brain</b> information <b>processing,</b> I was surprised to learn that the respected scholarly discussion is totally indifferent to the basic keynote question: "What is information?" in general or "What is visual information?" in particular.

Why was it overlooked in <b>brain</b> information <b>processing</b> research remains a conundrum. In this paper, I am trying to find a remedy for this bizarre situation.

In addition, the processing occurring around these dendritic trees can influence that occurring in those trees of nearby neurons whose dendrites are entangled but not in direct contact. In this way, processing in the brain can occur in a non-localized manner.
