2500|$|The first F-107A (s/n 55-5118) with North American's chief {{test pilot}} Bob Baker at the controls, made its initial flight on 10 September 1956, {{attaining}} Mach1.03. Although successfully carrying out its flight, the <b>brake</b> <b>chute</b> did not deploy, {{which resulted in}} a [...] "hot" [...] landing with the nose gear strut breaking. The aircraft first achieved Mach2 in tests on 3 November 1956.|$|E
5000|$|A related {{problem was}} that the aircraft's engines would have to be {{throttled}} down on landing approach. Since it could take as long as 20 seconds to throttle them back up to full power, the big bomber could not easily do a [...] "touch and go" [...] momentary landing. A 16-foot [...] "approach chute" [...] (drogue parachute) provided aerodynamic drag so that the aircraft could be flown at approach speeds with the engines throttled at ready-to-spool-up medium power. On the ground, the pilots used the 32-foot [...] "brake chute". The <b>brake</b> <b>chute</b> could be deployed to stop the aircraft from [...] "porpoising", or bouncing, after a hard landing on the front nose gear. Training typically included an hour of dragging this chute around the landing pattern for multiple practice landings.|$|E
50|$|On 6 September 2014 Chuk Williams of Steam Speed America {{attempted}} {{to break the}} current world record in their steam-powered streamliner. The car reached 147 mph on its first run, but flipped and crashed when its <b>braking</b> <b>chutes</b> failed to open, Williams was injured in the accident and the car severely damaged.|$|R
50|$|Some light tanks, {{such as the}} M551 Sheridan armored {{reconnaissance}} vehicle, {{could be}} rigged for low-velocity airdrops from cargo aircraft. With this method the tank is {{pulled out of the}} aircraft by <b>brake</b> <b>chutes</b> and skids to a stop. The crew does not ride in the tank during extraction, but parachutes from another plane. Upon landing, they go to their tank, release the lines, and drive it away.|$|R
50|$|The New Mexico State Police later send {{a report}} that a Mexican farmer spotted a parachute, {{attached}} {{to some sort of}} aircraft, land near his farm, 10 miles south of Alvarado, New Mexico. Chief Wilson (Bill Nagy) meets with Commander Prescott, showing him the wreckage. Tests later show that the automatic escape mechanism and <b>braking</b> <b>chute</b> operated perfectly. The tests also reveal an unknown rock-like material encased on the aircraft's hull; further testing shows this material is completely impervious to X-rays, infrared and ultraviolet light.|$|R
30|$|After {{assembly}} of the bogie, {{the upper end of}} the lever-type damper fits closely with one side of the bolster. In application, the lever-type damper rotates by a slight angle around the pivot because of irregularities in the track, and thus only requires a small space for installation. In practice, cracks in the side frame mainly occur on the top of the side frame pedestal and the <b>brake</b> <b>chutes</b> [18]. The lever-type damper is located on the side-frame spring seat, which, whilst it would slightly decrease the static strength of the spring seat, would not significantly weaken the fatigue strength of the side frame.|$|R
50|$|The Sheridan can be rigged for low-velocity airdrop from C-130 (42,000 lb max load), C-141 {{aircraft}} (38,500 lb max load), and the C-5. Many films exist {{showing the}} Sheridan being {{pulled out of}} a C-130 Hercules transport by <b>brake</b> <b>chutes</b> and skidding to a stop. The Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System (LAPES) is a somewhat risky maneuver that allows accurate delivery onto a field when landing is not possible, and the practice was stopped in the late 1990s. The tank is strapped down to a special pallet which absorbs most of the landing impact. The crew does not ride in the tank during extraction, but parachutes from another plane. On landing, they go to their tank, release the lines, and drive it away.|$|R
5000|$|In early Su-24 ("Fencer A" [...] {{according}} to NATO) aircraft these intakes had variable ramps, allowing a maximum speed of 2320 km/h, Mach 2.18, at altitude and a ceiling of 17500 m. Because the Su-24 is used almost exclusively for low-level missions, the actuators for the variable intakes were deleted to reduce weight and maintenance. This {{has no effect}} on low-level performance, but absolute maximum speed and altitude are cut to Mach 1.35 and 11000 m. The earliest Su-24 had a box-like rear fuselage, which was soon changed in production to a rear exhaust shroud more closely shaped around the engines in order to reduce drag. The revised aircraft also gained three side-by-side antenna fairings in the nose, a repositioned <b>braking</b> <b>chute,</b> and a new ram-air inlet {{at the base of the}} tail fin. The revised aircraft were dubbed [...] "Fencer-B" [...] by NATO, but did not merit a new Soviet designation.The Su-24's fixed armament is a single fast-firing GSh-6-23 cannon with 500 rounds of ammunition, mounted in the fuselage underside. The gun is covered with an eyelid shutter when not in use. The armament includes various nuclear weapons. Two or four R-60 (NATO AA-8 'Aphid') infrared missiles are usually carried for self-defence by the Su-24M/24MK.|$|R
2500|$|Electricity was {{provided}} via a bleed air-driven turbine {{housed in the}} rear fuselage, which in turn drove an AC alternator and DC generator; the approach was considered unusual at the time due to most aircraft using driveshaft-driven generators/alternators for electrical energy. A 28V DC battery provided emergency backup power. Aviation author Kev Darling stated of the Lightning: [...] "Never before had a fighter been so dependent upon electronics". Each engine was equipped {{with a pair of}} hydraulic pumps, one of which would provide pressure for the flight-control systems and the other, pressure for the undercarriage, flaps, and airbrakes; switchable hydraulic circuits were used for redundancy {{in the event of a}} leak or other failure. A combination of Dunlop Maxaret anti-skid brakes on the main wheels and an Irvin Air <b>Chute</b> <b>braking</b> parachute slowed the aircraft during landing; a tailhook was also fitted. Accumulators on the wheel brakes performed as backups to the hydraulics, providing minimal braking. Above a certain airspeed a stopped engine would 'windmill', i.e., continue to be rotated by the air flowing through it in a similar manner to a ram air turbine, sufficiently to still generate adequate hydraulic power for the powered controls during flight.|$|R

The radar had a limited range and no track while scanning capability, and it could detect targets only in a fairly narrow (40 degree) arc. While an automatic collision course attack system was developed and successfully demonstrated by English Electric, it was not adopted due to cost concerns. Plans were mooted to supplement or replace the obsolete Red Top and Firestreak missiles with modern AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles to help rectify some of the obsolescence, but these ambitions were never realised due to lack of funding. An alternative to the modernization of existing aircraft would have been the development of more advanced variants; a proposed Variable-sweep wing Lightning would have likely involved the adoption of a new powerplant and radar and was believed by BAC to significantly increase performance, but ultimately was not pursued.|$|R
