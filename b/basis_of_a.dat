In 1097, William II began the building of Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. The hall became the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new Palace of Westminster.|$|E

5|$|Ferugliotheriids {{are known}} {{from a few}} dozen {{isolated}} teeth and a questionably allocated jaw fragment. Most fossils are referred to Ferugliotherium; Trapalcotherium and Argentodites were each described on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single tooth. Their precise dental formula is unknown, but incisors, premolars, and molariform teeth have been identified. Gurovich suggested that Ferugliotherium had one incisor (possibly two in the upper jaw), no canines, one or two premolars, and two molars {{on each side of}} the lower and upper jaws.|$|E
5|$|Ferugliotherium is a genus {{of fossil}} mammals from the Campanian and/or Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous, around 70 million years ago) of Argentina {{in the family}} Ferugliotheriidae. It {{contains}} a single species, Ferugliotherium windhauseni, which was first described in 1986. Originally interpreted {{as a member of}} Multituberculata, an extinct group of small, rodent-like mammals, on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single brachydont (low-crowned) molar, it was recognized as related to the hypsodont (high-crowned) Sudamericidae after the discovery of additional material in the early 1990s. After a jaw of the sudamericid Sudamerica was described in 1999, these animals (collectively known as Gondwanatheria) were no longer considered to be multituberculates and a few fossils that were previously considered to be Ferugliotherium were assigned to unspecified multituberculates instead. Since 2005, a relationship between gondwanatheres and multituberculates has again received support. A closely related animal, Trapalcotherium, was described in 2009 on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single tooth.|$|E
5|$|In 1829, Richard Harlan {{renamed the}} turtle Emys muhlenbergii. The species was {{subsequently}} renamed to Calemys muhlenbergii by Louis Agassiz in 1857, and to Clemmys muhlenbergii by Henry Watson Fowler in 1906. Synonyms include Emys biguttata, named in 1824 by Thomas Say on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> turtle from {{the vicinity of}} Philadelphia, and Clemmys nuchalis, described by Dunn in 1917 from near Linville, North Carolina. Today, there are various names for the bog turtle, including mud turtle, marsh turtle, yellowhead, and snapper.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, racial, political, and {{personal}} tensions led to Singapore seceding from Malaysia and becoming an independent country. With {{the end of}} the confrontation, the last Vbombers were withdrawn in 1966. The following year, the British government announced its intention to withdraw its forces from East of Suez. The Singapore Naval Base was handed over to the government of Singapore on 8 December 1968, and Sembawang Shipyard subsequently became the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successful ship repair industry. The Red Beards were returned to the UK via the US in 1971.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{based on}} remains {{collected}} by Louis Etienne Thirioux {{in the early}} 20th century, the English ornithologist Daniel T. Holyoak placed a small subfossil Mauritian parrot in the same genus as the broad-billed parrot and named it Lophopsittacus bensoni. In 2007, on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> comparison of subfossils, correlated with 17th and 18th century descriptions of small grey parrots, Hume reclassified it as a species in the genus Psittacula and called it Thirioux's grey parrot. In 1967, James Greenway had speculated that reports of grey Mauritian parrots referred to the broad-billed parrot.|$|E
