25|$|The optimum {{size of a}} bench {{depends on}} the work to be done, space considerations, and budget. In general, <b>bigger</b> <b>is</b> better - though most woodworkers find that most work is done on the front few inches of the top, and then mostly in the front vise or right around the tail vise. So a smaller, narrow bench isn't {{as much of a}} {{drawback}} as might be expected - and it is far better than no bench at all. Tage Frid's classic bench is relatively small and {{it is one of the}} most copied designs. A big disadvantage of a smaller bench is that they are usually too light to resist heavy work without skidding around - but this problem can be overcome by attaching the bench to the floor.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] {{are related to}} third-wave {{feminism}} and self-empowerment. It confronts society's standards and stereotypes with regard to female beauty. The song opens with a recorded snippet of a beauty pageant judge questioning Beyoncé on her life aspirations, to which she replies, [...] "My aspiration in life would be... to be happy". The sample is used to frame the song {{in the context of}} the singer's childhood. According to Michael Cragg from The Guardian, the snippets were used to question the singer's [...] "drive and desire that's got her to where she is today, and whether the struggle was entirely worth it". The song then transcends into a depiction of Beyoncé as a beauty pageant contest awaiting judgment in the lyrics, [...] "Mama said, 'You're a pretty girl, what's in your head, it doesn't matter. Brush your hair, fix your teeth. What you wear is all that matters". The second verse of [...] "Pretty Hurts"—"Blonder hair, flat chest/ TV says <b>bigger</b> <b>is</b> better/ South Beach, sugar free/ Vogue says thinner is better"—serve as an analysis of female body image and society's obsession with physical perfection.|$|E

2500|$|According to Billboard, {{the album}} {{in its first}} week of release sold 54,000 copies in the US, debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 chart and at {{number one on the}} Independent Albums chart—making it the band's seventh top 10 album to date. The album has {{received}} generally positive reviews, with many reviewers finding Oceania to be a return to form for Corgan. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received thus far an average score of 72, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". RedEye gave the album three stars out of four, saying [...] "Oceania, the first full-length Pumpkins album since 2007's Zeitgeist, is the best thing Corgan and Co. have produced in quite some time. Longtime fans will hear hints of the grungy, vicious band of the Gish era and also the mellow, almost pop Adore era. It's a mix that works." [...] Antiquiet gave album four out of five stars and called it [...] "best Corgan work in a decade". Gigwise gave the album four stars out of five and praised its production and themes. Toronto Sun gave the album four stars out of five, saying [...] "With Billy Corgan, <b>bigger</b> <b>is</b> better. And his latest project—the ongoing 44-song Teargarden by Kaleidyscope—is his most ambitious since 2000's Machina. In keeping, this 'album-within-an-album' bears all the classic Pumpkins hallmarks: Searing guitars and busy drums, epic songs and complex arrangements, wistful romanticism and bombastic grandeur. His best work in years." ...|$|E

60|$|And if too big an army {{is likely}} to be a mere {{encumbrance}} in war, it is perhaps even a still graver blunder to maintain one during that conflict of preparation which is at present the European substitute for actual hostilities. It consumes. It produces nothing. It not only eats and drinks and wears out its clothes and withdraws men from industry, but under the stress of invention it needs constantly to be re-armed and freshly equipped at an expenditure proportionate to its size. So long as the conflict of preparation goes on, then the bigger the army your adversary maintains under arms the <b>bigger</b> <b>is</b> his expenditure and the less his earning power. The less the force you employ to keep your adversary over-armed, and the longer you remain at peace with him while he is over-armed, the greater is your advantage. There is only one profitable use for any army, and that is victorious conflict. Every army that is not engaged in victorious conflict is an organ of national expenditure, an exhausting growth in the national body. And for Great Britain an attempt to create a conscript army would involve the very maximum of moral and material exhaustion with the minimum of military efficiency. It would be a disastrous waste of resources that we need most urgently for other things.|$|E
