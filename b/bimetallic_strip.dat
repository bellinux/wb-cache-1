25|$|A direct {{indicating}} {{dial thermometer}} (such as a patio thermometer or a meat thermometer) uses a <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> wrapped into a coil. One {{end of the}} coil is fixed to the housing of the device and the other drives an indicating needle. A <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> is also used in a recording thermometer. Breguet's thermometer consists of a tri-metallic helix.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> wound into a coil. The {{center of}} the coil is {{attached}} to a rotating post attached to lever (1). As the coil gets colder the moving end carrying (4) moves clockwise.|$|E
25|$|In the {{regulation}} of heating and cooling, thermostats that operate {{over a wide range}} of temperatures are used. In these, one end of the <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> is mechanically fixed and attached to an electrical power source, while the other (moving) end carries an electrical contact. In adjustable thermostats another contact is positioned with a regulating knob or lever. The position so set controls the regulated temperature, called the set point.|$|E
50|$|Thermostats {{have used}} <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strips</b> but digital {{thermistors}} have since become popular.|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} for augmenting vibration damping characteristics in space structures with large panels is presented. It {{is based on}} generation of bending moments rather than forces. The moments are generated using <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strips,</b> suitably mounted at selected stations {{on both sides of}} the large panels, under the influence of differential solar heating, giving rise to thermal gradients and stresses. The collocated angular velocity sensors are utilized in conjunction with mini-servos to regulate the control moments by flipping the <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strips.</b> A simple computation of the rate of dissipation of vibrational energy is undertaken to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R
50|$|The {{force to}} open the vent is {{provided}} a number of ways, the most common being through thermal expansion and by electric motors. Thermal expansion based actuators use either the differential expansion rate of different materials (<b>bimetallic</b> <b>strips)</b> or special fluids with large {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} in pistons. This approach is cheap, reliable and passive (requires no external energy).|$|R
25|$|Mechanical clock {{mechanisms}} {{are sensitive to}} temperature changes which lead to errors in time keeping. A <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> is used to compensate for this in some mechanisms. The most common method {{is to use a}} bimetallic construction for the circular rim of the balance wheel. As the spring controlling the balance becomes weaker with increasing temperature, so the balance becomes smaller in diameter to keep the period of oscillation (and hence timekeeping) constant.|$|E
25|$|A <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> is used {{to convert}} a {{temperature}} change into mechanical displacement. The strip consists of two strips of different metals which expand at different rates as they are heated, usually steel and copper, {{or in some cases}} steel and brass. The strips are joined together throughout their length by riveting, brazing or welding. The different expansions force the flat strip to bend one way if heated, and in the opposite direction if cooled below its initial temperature. The metal with the higher coefficient of thermal expansion is on the outer side of the curve when the strip is heated and on the inner side when cooled.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{magnetic}} circuit breakers, {{which are the}} type found in most distribution boards, incorporate both techniques with the electromagnet responding instantaneously to large surges in current (short circuits) and the <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> responding to less extreme but longer-term over-current conditions. The thermal portion of the circuit breaker provides a time response feature, that trips the circuit breaker sooner for larger overcurrents but allows smaller overloads to persist for a longer time. This allows short current spikes such as are produced when a motor or other non-resistive load is switched on. With very large over-currents during a short-circuit, the magnetic element trips the circuit breaker with no intentional additional delay.|$|E
5000|$|Older devices, such as <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strips,</b> {{were used}} in {{conjunction}} with pilot lights. The pilot light is no longer used in new devices, but may still be encountered on old appliances still in service. Pilot lights were withdrawn because their continual small flame represented a waste of fuel. [...] Pilot lights required their own FSD, typically a thermocouple which held the valve open. [...] Regular testing of FSD is a part of routine maintenance for gas appliances.|$|R
30|$|The experiment-based {{solar tracker}} is {{presented}} and passively activated by aluminum/steel <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strips.</b> The efficiency {{is up to}} 23 % over fixed solar panels. The results show the excellent agreement with the computer model (Clifford and Eastwood 2004). A design, modeling and testing of an active single-axis solar tracker are presented. The smart tracker system operates at different modes to provide flexibility to accommodate different weather conditions by using light-dependent resister (LDR). Moreover, an experimental analysis shows {{an agreement with the}} performance of MATLAB/Simulink model (Chin et al. 2011; Chin 2012).|$|R
2500|$|Further {{experimentation}} and invention by Arnold {{led to a}} breakthrough in the late 1770s. He redesigned the compensation balance and developed two designs that showed promise. Known as the [...] "T" [...] and [...] "S" [...] balances, and marked as such in Arnold's 1782 patent (probably because of their appearance), both employed <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strips</b> of brass and steel with weights attached, which changed the radius of gyration with change in temperature. Although these probably needed a lot of adjustment, {{they appear to have}} worked well compared to his previous attempts at a compensation balance.|$|R
25|$|The balance {{consisted}} of a circular steel balance wheel with two bimetallic strips attached diametrically. Each <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> terminated with a screw thread mounted with a weight or balance nut. The further along the strip this nut was screwed, the greater the compensating effect. Another part of the patent concerned an addition to {{the form of the}} balance springâ€”a coil of smaller radius {{at each end of the}} helical spring, which offered increasing resistance to the rotating balance as it turned towards the end of each vibration. This was an important invention, as it largely eliminated the problem of the positional adjustment of balance controlled watches. This device, known as the Overcoil balance spring is still used today in most precision mechanical watches.|$|E
500|$|Nautical {{chronometers}} were {{of great}} importance in the 18th and 19th centuries as aids to navigation. [...] Accurate measurement of time was needed for the determination of longitude. [...] Earnshaw {{was not the first}} to make such chronometers, but {{he was one of the}} first to make them cheaply enough that they started to become essential equipment for a ship at sea. [...] By the time the Beagle set sail it was being reported in The Nautical Magazine that the price of chronometers was dropping rapidly while the same quality was being maintained. [...] Earnshaws' chronometer had a novel escapement mechanism, the spring detent escapement, and a <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> for temperature compensation so that it would continue to maintain accuracy in all climates around the world.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bimetallic</b> <b>strips</b> and disks, which {{convert a}} {{temperature}} change into mechanical displacement, {{are the most}} recognized bimetallic objects due to their name. However, there are other common bimetallic objects. For example, tin cans consist of steel covered with tin. The tin prevents the can from rusting. To cut costs and prevent people from melting them down for their metal, coins are often composed of a cheap metal covered with a more expensive metal. For example, the United States penny was changed from 95% copper to 95% zinc, with a thin copper plating to retain its appearance. A common type of trimetallic object (before the all-aluminium can) was a tin-plated steel can with an aluminum lid with a pull tab. Making the lid out of aluminum allowed it to be pulled off by hand instead of using a can opener, but these cans proved difficult to recycle owing to their mix of metals.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: Quality of life (QoL) {{for elderly}} {{residents}} {{of care and}} attention (C&A) homes has become an important consideration given the increasingly aging population. Due {{to the number of}} hours such residents spend indoors, the quality of the facilities can contribute to their day to day QoL. This study investigates the effect of facilities management (FM) on the QoL of Chinese elderly people living in C&A homes. Design/Methodology/Approach: A survey of perceived satisfaction with the components of FM and QoL was carried out with a sample of residents. A total of 18 FM components and five QoL domains, including physical health, independence, psychological health, social relationships and living environment, as well as overall QoL were identified. Findings: The findings show that; (1) physical health is influenced by accessibility, doors and windows and signage; (2) independence can be improved by enhancing accessibility, water supply, lighting and ventilation; (3) accessibility, water supply, distance and doors and windows all predict psychological health; (4) social relationships are improved by lighting and ventilation; (5) distance impacts positively on living environment and (6) overall QoL is predicted by lighting, ventilation, accessibility, doors and windows, handrails, recreation and signage. Originality/Value: The study recommends that designers and facilities managers review the micro-climate settings to harness available natural lighting and ventilation, introduce <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strips</b> to the heating systems to maintain a suitable water temperature and install large, easy to understand and graphic signage for straightforward wayfinding in C&A homes...|$|R
25|$|This {{surviving}} watch {{dates from}} around 1769-1770, and is signed Arnold No. 1 Invenit et Fecit. The movement, which indicates centre seconds, has a steel balance with a <b>bimetallic</b> temperature compensation <b>strip</b> that acts {{on the flat}} balance spring. Though now altered, the original escapement was Arnold's horizontal pivoted detent as fitted to the larger timekeepers, which was it seems not entirely successful and needed improvements.|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> {{was made}} by the eighteenth-century clockmaker John Harrison who is generally credited with its invention. He made it for his third marine chronometer (H3) of 1759 [...] to compensate for temperature-induced changes in the balance spring. It {{should not be confused with}} the bimetallic mechanism for correcting for thermal expansion in his gridiron pendulum. His earliest examples had two individual metal strips joined by rivets but he also invented the later technique of directly fusing molten brass onto a steel substrate. A strip of this type was fitted to his last timekeeper, H5. Harrison's invention is recognized in the memorial to him in Westminster Abbey, England.|$|E
2500|$|This {{machine was}} {{completely}} different from Harrison's watch. It was a mahogany box of approximately [...] that housed a movement that, though relatively simple, {{was close to the}} same size as Harrison's, with a balance of a similar diameter. The radical difference, however, was a newly designed escapement that featured a horizontally placed pivoted detent that allowed the balance to vibrate freely, except when impulsed by the escape wheel. The spiral balance spring also had a temperature compensation device similar to those in Arnold's watches, and based on Harrison's <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> of brass and steel. Arnold proposed manufacture of these timekeepers at 60 guineas each.|$|E
2500|$|Thermostats use {{different}} types of sensors to measure the temperature. In one form, the mechanical thermostat, a <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> {{in the form of}} a coil directly operates electrical contacts that control the heating or cooling source. Electronic thermostats, instead, use a thermistor or other semiconductor sensor that requires amplification and processing to control the heating or cooling equipment (or even both, through the use of relays). A thermostat is an example of a [...] "bang-bang controller" [...] as the heating or cooling equipment output is not proportional to the difference between actual temperature and the temperature setpoint. Instead, the heating or cooling equipment runs at full capacity until the set temperature is reached, then shuts off. Increasing the difference between the thermostat setting and the desired temperature therefore does not change the time to achieve the desired temperature. The rate at which the target system temperature can change is determined both by the capacity of the heating or cooling equipment to respectively add or remove heat to or from a target system and the capacity of the target system to store heat.|$|E
50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motorâ€™s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal overload protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strips</b> will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motorâ€™s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motorâ€™s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motorâ€™s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motorâ€™s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|R

50|$|This {{duration}} {{is controlled}} by the thermotime switch, which is a <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> based device placed in the water jacket {{or in the case of}} an air-cooled engine, in the engine/timing case. When an engine first starts, the coolant temperature is cold and the <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> is closed, which in turn supplies the cold start injector with current.|$|E
5000|$|Within the device, {{the very}} small {{electric}} heating element heats a <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip.</b> After some time, the <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> bends to open a set of switch contacts, thus interrupting the electric current to the heating element. At the same time, another (more robust) set of spring-loaded switch contacts, mounted in parallel with the former, also open, cutting off the heavy current to the [...] "burner". Both the small heating element and the [...] "burner" [...] now begin to cool off. At some point the <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> will be sufficiently straight to trigger both sets of switch contacts to close, thus causing both the small heating element and the [...] "burner" [...] to recommence the above heating cycle.|$|E
50|$|In modern designs, {{once the}} water has reached boiling point, the kettle {{automatically}} deactivates, preventing the water from boiling away and damaging the heating element. A <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> thermostat is commonly used as the automatic shut-off mechanism. The thermostat is isolated from {{the water in the}} kettle and is instead heated by the steam created when the water boils, which is directed through a duct onto the <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip.</b> This allows the thermostat to be coarsely calibrated, which in turn allows the kettle to function normally at a wide range of altitudes. A consequence of this design is that the kettle may fail to deactivate if the lid is left open, due to an insufficient amount of steam being ducted onto the <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip.</b>|$|E
50|$|A glow switch starter {{is a type}} of preheat starter {{used with}} {{fluorescent}} lamp. It is commonly filled with neon gas or argon gas and contains a <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> and a stationary electrode. The operating principle is simple, when current is applied, the gas inside ionizes and heats a <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> which in turn bends toward the stationary electrode thus shorting the starter between the electrodes of the fluorescent lamp After a second the starter's <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> will cool and open the circuit between the electrodes and the process repeats until the lamp has lit. One disadvantage of glow switch starters is that when the lamp {{is at the end of}} its life it will continuously blink on and off until the glow switch starter wears out or an electrode on the fluorescent lamp burns out.|$|E

50|$|A small {{heater coil}} {{is built into}} the thermotime switch, which {{effectively}} gives a timed output to the cold start injector with the timing duration dependent on the temperature of the engine.

50|$|In {{electrical}} switches, including <b>bimetallic</b> <b>strip</b> based thermostats, {{the switch}} usually has hysteresis in the switching action.
