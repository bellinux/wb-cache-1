But the rumours that had been spread demonising Hazlitt, along with the vilifications of the Tory press, not only hurt his pride <b>but</b> <b>seriously</b> obstructed his ability to earn a living. Income from his lectures had also proved insufficient to keep him afloat.|$|E

Hinckley did not try to flee and was arrested at the scene. All of the shooting victims survived. Brady was hit in the right side of the head, and endured a long recuperation period, remaining paralyzed on the left side of his body until his death on August 4, 2014. Brady's death was ruled a homicide 33 years after the shooting.|$|E
25|$|Set {{against a}} {{backdrop}} of rapid economic development and social changes in post-Mao China, the protests reflected anxieties about the country's future in the popular consciousness and among the political elite. The reforms of the 1980s had led to a nascent market economy which benefitted some people <b>but</b> <b>seriously</b> disaffected others; the one-party political system also faced a challenge of legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy, and restrictions on political participation. The students called for democracy, greater accountability, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech, though they were loosely organized and their goals varied. At the height of the protests, about a million people assembled in the Square.|$|E

25|$|The above {{primary sources}} of {{influence}} on women of Islam do {{not deal with}} every conceivable situation over time. This {{led to the development}} of jurisprudence and religious schools with Islamic scholars that referred to resources such as identifying authentic documents, internal discussions and establishing a consensus to find the correct religiously approved course of action for Muslims. These formed the secondary sources of influence for women. Among them are ijma, qiya, ijtihad and others depending on sect and the school of Islamic law. Included in secondary sources are fatwas, which are often widely distributed, orally or in writing by Muslim clerics, to the masses, in local language and describe behavior, roles and rights of women that conforms with religious requirements. Fatwas are theoretically non-binding, <b>but</b> <b>seriously</b> considered and have often been practiced by most Muslim believers. The secondary sources typically fall into five types of influence: the declared role or behavior for Muslims, both women and men, is considered obligatory, commendable, permissible, despised or prohibited. There is considerable controversy, change over time, and conflict between the secondary sources.|$|E

500|$|According to Mark Wilson of About.com, Amanda Tapping was {{enthusiastic}} {{about creating a}} radically different character after eleven years playing Samantha Carter in Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis, and expended tremendous effort to separate Helen from Carter as successfully as possible. Tapping was able to successfully portray a woman who's experienced {{a century and a}} half of isolation, strangeness, and relentless compassion. Rick Bentley from McClatchy Newspapers commented Tapping's role as Dr. Magnus was a way for the actor to make a name of herself outside the Stargate universe as Carter. Magnus is also described as a [...] "non-glib, female Jack Harkness;" [...] Jack Harkness being the main character from the British science fiction show Torchwood. Hilary Rothing of UGO said that [...] "Dr. Helen Magnus is intelligent, alluring and has one of those tasty British accents – Victorian era to be exact. That's because she's a 157 years old. <b>But</b> <b>seriously,</b> she doesn't look a day over 35." [...] She also added that Tapping is [...] "right at home" [...] taking the lead for the show. Alex Walker of Den of Geek believed Magnus was [...] "typical for an English character in an American TV show, with a liking for tea and a cut-glass elocution betraying no hint of a regional accent". Helen Magnus has been listed number ten in TV Squad's [...] "Ten Most mysterious characters on television".|$|E
500|$|While {{reviewing}} the album, Shirley Shipin of Rolling Stone opined that [...] "Breakaway" [...] was {{the highlight of}} the album where Clarkson sounded [...] "more Avril than Ashlee". Rhonda Lynn of Florida Entertainment Scene praised the acoustic guitar in the song which is instrumental in holding the whole structure together. Tammy La Gorce of Amazon.com thought that the song would not wear out due to its [...] "rock-friendly thumps, dips, and rolls." [...] In a different perspective, Joan Anderman of Boston.com remarked that [...] "Breakaway" [...] is not new or exciting-sounding but he admitted that the [...] "hit single accomplishes the rare feat of being thoroughly middle-of-the-road without sacrificing grace or intelligence". Chuck Taylor of Billboard felt that the song was a weak choice as a single compared to Clarkson's previous hits, writing Breakaway' sounds more like an Irish folk song propped up with pop production than the anthemic material with which Clarkson has won over legions of fans." [...] Kathi Kamen Goldmark of Disney Family.com felt that the song was tedious, simultaneously dull and so emotionally overwrought that it almost sounds like a parody of itself. Michael Wood of The Village Voice described the song as [...] "a swoony acoustic folk-pop that Goo Goo Doll Johnny Rzeznik would trade his hair gel for". Jill Salama of Oprah.com listed [...] "Breakaway" [...] as one of her nine favourite Idol singles of all time, writing [...] "There is nothing that gets us more than a song about a girl going out on her own. Making a wish, making a change and, of course, breaking away. <b>But</b> <b>seriously,</b> this song {{is more than just a}} high school graduation anthem." ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{career began}} in the East Indies, where he served aboard the frigate [...] with two fellow youths Horatio Nelson and Thomas Troubridge who he would remain in contact with as they each rose through the ranks in the navy. He {{eventually}} {{spent most of his}} youth serving in the West Indies and off the American coasts during the American War of Independence, seeing action in a number of battles with the French. He was a commander {{by the end of the}} war, but peace left him without a ship or promotion prospects. He married during the period of peace, taking the surname Bertie in accordance with his father-in-law's will, and also used his time ashore to carry out experiments that led to the introduction of lifebuoys to the navy. Returning to active service during the wars with revolutionary France, Bertie commanded a number of ships, often in the North Sea or the English Channel. His experience led to him being assigned to the expedition to the Baltic with Sir Hyde Parker and his old friend Horatio Nelson. Bertie was involved in the fierce fighting during the Battle of Copenhagen, and received Nelson's praise for his actions. This was the start of Bertie's long association with the Baltic, both as a captain, and after his promotion to rear-admiral. His good service led to a knighthood and an appointment to the Swedish Order of the Sword, <b>but</b> <b>seriously</b> weakened his health.
