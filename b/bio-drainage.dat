40|$|Years of {{intensive}} irrigated farming in the inland valleys of northern Israel have caused secondary salinity in vast areas. Soil salinity/sodicity surveys, conducted after {{the problem was}} recognised, showed relatively high levels of sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) in the active soil layers. In a sample of 7 affected fields, 92. 5 % of the 1584 SAR measurements on cored soil samples had values> 5, and 39 % had values> 15. Two ameliorative approaches were conceived to reverse the evident salinity/sodicity trends in the Yizre’el Valley: (a) a gravitational, newly engineered, subsurface drainage system; and (b) <b>bio-drainage,</b> using eucalypts {{as a means to}} control the high water tables. Both approaches were very successful according to the chosen criteria. The drainage system, comprising 3 drain components, effectively controlled excess water from 3 sources: direct infiltration, lateral subsurface flow, and a deep, presumably upward-seeping, artesian aquifer. The groundwater table response to the installation of the applied drainage system was immediate. In the next rainy season, there was an associated and appreciable deep leaching of Cl – and somewhat less of Na+. More than 3000 ha of land has been drained in this way in the past 10 years in the northern, salinity-prone, inland valleys. The <b>bio-drainage</b> approach, tested in 5 different waterlogged and salinity-affected sites in the Yizre’e...|$|E
40|$|Years of {{intensive}} irrigated farming in the Oasis area of Xinjiang in north-western China has caused secondary salinization of vast areas of land {{since the mid}} 1980 s. Soil salinity/sodicity surveys in the area, conducted after the problem surfaced, showed relatively high levels of the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) in the upper soil layers. In one. study, 92 % of cored soil samples of the affected fields showed SAR values above 5, while 42 % had values above 15. One ameliorative approach, <b>bio-drainage</b> using different desert vegetations, was used to control the high water-tables and reverse the observed salinity/sodicity trends in the border area of the Manas Alluvial Fan. The ground-water table dropped to below 2. 28 m {{in the summer of}} the fifth year, which was sufficient to prevent secondary salinization. A related plot study showed that Lycium barbarum and Puccinellia Chinamponsis consumed large amounts of soil water while leaving most of the salts behind. The salt contents of leaves and young branches were different for different vegetation. Soil profile salt distributions for the deep-rooted and shallow-rooted systems were different in two of the three years after planting. Commercial forestry of L. barbarum and other timber products under current conditions, and without irrigation, appears a viable agricultural alternative that could bring higher returns than for wheat or cotton. Results {{of this study indicate that}} both conventional and biological drainage are attractive options for controlling the local hydrology and limiting or diminishing salinity-sodicity trends.
