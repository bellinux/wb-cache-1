It is unclear how many Native Americans were killed by foreign diseases after the arrival of Columbus in the Americas, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> have been estimated {{to be close to}} 70% of the indigenous population. The damage done by this disease significantly aided European attempts to displace and conquer the native population.|$|E
5|$|The Ayyubids {{generally}} employed Kurds, Turks, {{and people}} from the Caucasus for the higher-ranking posts {{of the military and}} bureaucratic fields. Not much is known about the foot soldiers of the Ayyubid army, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of cavalrymen are known to have fluctuated between 8,500 and 12,000. The cavalry was largely composed of free-born Kurds, Turks, and Turkomans whom Ayyubid emirs and sultans purchased as slaves (mamluks). In addition, there existed Arab auxiliaries, former Fatimid units such as the Nubians, and separate Arab contingents—notably from the Kinaniyya tribe, who were largely devoted to the defense of Egypt. Rivalry between Kurdish and Turkish troops occurred occasionally when leading positions were at stake and towards the end of Ayyubid rule, Turks outnumbered Kurds in the army. Despite their Kurdish background, the sultans remained impartial to both groups.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} days of the war, enthusiasm for the Southern cause was high, and many ship owners responded to the appeal by {{applying}} for letters of marque. Not all of those who gained authorization actually went to sea, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of privateers were high enough to be a major concern for US Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles. Many ships of the Union Navy were diverted from blockade duty in efforts to capture privateers. Most of the privateers managed to remain free, but enough were caught that the owners and crew had to consider the risk seriously. The capture of the privateers Savannah and Jefferson Davis resulted in important court cases that did much to define the nature of the Civil War itself.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who were}} rescued first {{were taken to}} another {{building}} for treatment, as the ambulances were trapped inside the collapsed tower. The hospital {{did not have an}} emergency plan but nonetheless, surviving hospital workers and neighbors quickly improvised, under the management of the hospital, setting up aid stations and scavenging supplies. Rescue workers soon arrived to start digging through the rubble. A second quake made rescue work slower, because of fear of further collapse. Most bodies were identified by personal effects, some by dental records and some were so mangled that they wound up being cremated without ever being identified, {{due to the lack of}} morgue facilities. 561 bodies were found and 188 were never identified. 266 were hospital workers and 44 were medical residents. The majority who were rescued were found in the first five days. The number of bodies recovered was high during those first days as well <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> dramatically increased between days 17 and 31.|$|E

25|$|Viewer {{ratings for}} Gilmore Girls were not large, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> were a {{relative}} {{success for the}} small WB network and it became one of their flagship series. For its first season the show aired in the tough Thursday 8pm/7pm Central time slot dominated by Friends on NBC and Survivor on CBS. Critical acclaim encouraged the network to move it to Tuesday evenings, {{as part of a}} push to promote the series and due to the move of Tuesday stalwart Buffy the Vampire Slayer to UPN in the same timeslot. During season 2, ratings for Gilmore Girls surpassed Buffy and it became The WB's third-highest-rated show, with viewer numbers that grew by double digits in all major demographics. For seasons 4–7, Gilmore Girls was up against the US's top-rated show American Idol, which led to a drop in viewers, but with Season 5 it became The WB's second-most-watched prime time show. The series was often in the top 3 most-viewed shows in its timeslot for women under 35.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} man the force, Murad II {{developed}} the devşirme system of recruiting {{youths in the}} form of taxes from Christians in the empire. Murad used the strength of the kapikulus and played them off against the nobility, forcing them to pay taxes or land so that the treasury could obtain the money it needed to maintain the Kapikulu army. The janissaries comprised infantry units that formed the Ottoman sultan's household troops and bodyguard. The first janissary units comprised war captives and slaves. After the 1380s Sultan Mehmet I filled their ranks with the results of taxation in human form called devshirmeh: the Sultan's men conscripted a number of non-Muslim, usually Christian, boysat first at random, later, by strict selectionto be trained. Initially they favored Greeks, Albanians (who also supplied many gendarmes), usually selecting about one in five boys of ages seven to fourteen <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> could be changed to correspond with the need for soldiers. Next the devshirmeh was extended to also include Serbs, Bosnians and other Balkan countries, later especially Ukraine and southern Russia.|$|E
25|$|Wise begged Richmond to {{send him}} some guns, as had Hill before him, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> that were {{actually}} sent were inadequate. They were distributed into several nominal forts: facing Croatan Sound were twelve guns in Fort Huger, at Weir's Point, the northwestern corner of the island; four guns in Fort Blanchard, about a mile (1.6km) to the southeast; and nine guns in Fort Bartow, at the romantically-named Pork Point, {{about a quarter of}} the way down the island. Across the sound, at Redstone Point opposite Fort Huger, two old canal barges had been pushed up onto the mud, protected by sandbags and cotton bales, armed with seven guns, and named Fort Forrest. These were all the guns that would bear on the sound; the southern half of the island, nearest Pamlico Sound, in the direction from which the attack would come, was unprotected. Five other guns did not face Croatan Sound: a battery of two guns on the eastern side of the island protected against possible assault across Roanoke Sound, and three others occupied an earthwork near the geometric center of the island.|$|E

In 1995 there were 4 million visitors but by 2005 this had risen to 5.3 million. In 2007 69% of visitors to the resort were day visitors, compared to 58% in 2005. The 2005 survey showed that day visitors stay in Weston-super-Mare for an average of six hours whilst overnight visitors stay for an average of five nights. The largest percentage of visitors (22%) were from the West Midlands. Weston was found to attract two distinct groups: [...] "grey tourists" [...] over the age of 60 and families with young children.|$|E
500|$|Filming began {{during the}} second week of August 1967. Three {{temporary}} sets and a portion of corridor were constructed for specific use in this episode, which included the large trading post set. The chairs in that set were a problem, as the set designers wanted 24 matching chairs and decided that folding ones would not do. John M. Dwyer sourced them from a local company, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> required meant that they had to be pulled out of showrooms from all over the county. When it came to the fight scene in the episode, Dwyer warned director Joseph Pevney not to damage the chairs. That scene was filmed twice after a cameraman with a handheld camera wandered onto the set. The scene where Kirk is covered with tribbles in the grain container needed to be filmed eight times, using all five hundred sewn tribbles. Gerrold had expected that scene to be cut at some point during production, as he thought that William Shatner would not agree to it. He said that Shatner was the [...] "consummate professional and I believe he was eager to show off his comic abilities".|$|E

This fragment measured [...] high by [...] wide and was [...] thick. Five stela fragments were left where they had fallen, they contained parts of the frame and of the feathered headdress.
