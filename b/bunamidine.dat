40|$|Results are {{reported}} from 26 trials of various drugs {{for the treatment}} of canine echinococcosis. In all, 613 dogs were employed. Arecoline hydrobromide and Anthelin, in single trials of each, failed to remove even half the E. granulosus worms in 50 % of the dogs treated with these compounds. A total of 24 trials were carried out with a series of 8 naphthalene derivatives and compounds of this series were effective in eliminating E. granulosus; at least one of them, <b>bunamidine</b> hydrochloride, seems to show sufficient promise as an improved method of treatment for field application and evaluation trials to be made...|$|E
40|$|The protoscolices {{and free}} cysts of Echinococcus multilocularis were {{incubated}} {{for ten days}} in three kinds of media to which different kinds of the drugs were added at the rates of 10, 40 and 100 Î³ per ml. The main medium, which consists essentially of medium 199 with calf serum in proportion of 20 per cent, {{was used for the}} drugs soluble in water. Most drugs insoluble or slightly soluble in water were added to the main medium as a solution in 2 mg per ml of propylene glycol. To observe the effect of propylene glycol, the scolicidal effect of <b>bunamidine</b> hydrochloride suspended in the medium containing 0. 3 % methylcellulose were compared with that in the medium with propylene glycol. The survival rates of protoscolices and free cysts with each drug were compared to each other together with those tested in the preceding report (SAKAMOTO et al., 1965). The derivatives of halogenized salicylanilide manifested the highest scolicidal effect, and the derivatives of halogenized bisphenol ranked next. <b>Bunamidine</b> hydrochloride and cyanine dyes gave a comparatively high scolicidal effect. The intensity of scolicidal action in halogenized derivatives of salicylanilide and bisphenol increased with the increase of the number of halogen atoms, such as chlorine and bromine, in their phenol rings. The presence of propylene glycol in the medium shows a tendency to increase the intensity of scolicidal action of drugs insoluble in water...|$|E
