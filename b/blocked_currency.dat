40|$|During its 13 year history, {{the euro}} area {{experienced}} {{the most severe}} economic downturn in the late 2000 s {{as a result of}} the 2007 financial-economic crisis stemming from the US banking sector. The crisis in the monetary union, besides posting a significant economic and social cost, revealed several weaknesses not just of the <b>currency</b> <b>block</b> as a whole, but also of its constituting members, which were masked by the prosperous economic environment characteristic for the 2000 s. These conditions have put to the test the solidarity among the euro zone members, or in other words the existence of the <b>currency</b> <b>block.</b> One important problem of the <b>currency</b> <b>block</b> is the lack of harmony between the fiscal and economic policies of the member states, creating several and occasionally very divergent parts of the <b>currency</b> <b>block.</b> The aim of this research is to enhance the Maastricht convergence criteriaâ€™s and the Stability and Growth Pactâ€™s role as a monitoring mechanism, allowing them to become more informative tools for the policy makers. For this, based on the relevant literature, we propose new potential explanatory variables which could enhance the role of the Maastricht convergence criteria and the Stability and Growth Pact. Some of the studied variables, like indebtedness of the private sector, capital flow compared to the size of the economy, government revenue compared to total public debt and current account balance help in enforcing the nominal convergence, while others (real labour productivity) contribute to the real convergence. The explanatory power of the proposed variables are investigated in the case of France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain for the period comprised between 2000 Q 1 - 2011 Q 4. Results of the research show that with the exception of government revenue compared to total public debt, all proposed variables have significant explanatory power regarding the evolution of the state of the economy in all seven countries analyzed. France and Germany, characterized by healthy fiscal and economic policies is also exposed to risks stemming from the evolution of the private debt. In case of Greece, Ireland and Spain the high current account deficit represented a significant explanatory variable, while the outstanding loans to the private sector proved to be significant in the case of Ireland, Italy and Portugal. The significance of real labour productivity for Greece and Italy proves that real convergence should also be obtained beside nominal convergence by economies in the <b>currency</b> <b>block.</b> All significant variables had explanatory power through their lagged value, hence counterbalancing policies can be elaborated in a timely manner in order to stabilize the economy if signs indicate a potentially unsustainable economic path...|$|R

40|$|Summary Like the European {{economic}} crises {{of the nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries, the crisis in East Asia is essentially an overproduction crisis. As in other such episodes, the East Asian case was characterised by large current account deficits prior to the crisis. Capital flows were channelled into investment projects, yet the region's underdeveloped banking systems served to exacerbate liquidity fluctuations rather than limit them. IMF resources and demand management are essential for crisis management. In the long run, <b>currency</b> <b>blocks</b> may produce more stable currency arrangements...|$|R
40|$|Tiny {{changes in}} the American {{monetary}} policy can have dramatic effects {{on the rest of}} the world because of dollar's double role of national and international currency. This is the Triffin dilemma. The paper shows how it works through three examples: price of commodities, dollarization, and the international financial position of the US. And it makes a proposal to solve these issues, creating a more stable monetary system. In particular, it suggests the creation of an international monetary system of <b>block</b> regional <b>currencies.</b> Globalization and regionalization should be the two forces leading towards the new monetary system. The US and Europe should consider to adopt the same currency through a system of fixed exchange rates (global currency). This currency should perform its duty of anchor of the system, reducing global imbalances and gyrations in price of commodities. Developing countries, by contrast, should create regional monetary unions (regional currencies), preserving the real exchange rate as shock absorber, but gaining in terms of time consistency and credibility.

The linearity of the monetary model and heavy tail distributed fundamentals are sufficient conditions for fundamentals-based repeated joint currency crises.

40|$|The current paper {{analyses}} {{the similarities}} between the Bretton Woods system (BWS) and the Eurozone and looks into the future of the world monetary system. The gold standard, the Keynes Plan and the White Plan are identified as the most important sources of ideas that formed the BWS. Although Keynes was not particularly successful in Bretton Woods, his plan played a decisive role later on in the critique of the BWS {{as well as in the}} design of the European Monetary System. Either system was based on the concept of fixed exchange rates which were seen as more apt for international economic relations than flexible rates. In the BWS, fixed rates were seen to be achieved by coordinating economic policies of member states and by sporadic realignments of exchange rates. In the Eurozone, only policy coordination is available to fulfil this function. The favourable experience made so far with the euro may be utilised for monetary integration in other parts of the world. The Eurozone is also considered good practice for any reform of the international monetary system. Given the diverging political and economic goals of the major <b>currency</b> <b>blocks,</b> it may be questioned, however, whether the success of the euro also furthers the idea of developing a single world currency.

40|$|The {{collection}} contains {{the records of}} the Jewish Agricultural Settlement Corporation (JASC), the American branch of the Juedische Landarbeit GmbH, an organization that sought to resettle German-Jewish farmers to Brazil during the 1930 s. The files mostly concern the legal and financial maintenance of the organization, but there are also some documents about the settlements and the settlers, particularly from 1939 to 1941. The documents after 1946 concern refunds and the legal administration of JASC aimed to dissolve the corporation. People and organizations most frequently mentioned are:Frederic Borchardt, Franz Wolf, Fritz Schwarzschild, Hermann Simon, Dr. J. L. Seligsohn (Reichsvertretung), James Rosenberg (JDC), Ludwig Grunebaum, the Joint Distribution Committee, and the Jewish Colonization Association. The Jewish Agricultural Settlement Corporation (JASC) was the American branch of the Juedische Landarbeit GmbH, an organization that sought to resettle German-Jewish farmers to Brazil, {{and to a lesser extent}} to the Dominican Republic, during the 1930 s. The Juedische Landarbeit GmbH (JLA) was founded 1930 by Martin Gerson as a Halutzim organization for teaching German Jews agricultural skills. In cooperation with the Reichsvertretung der Deutschen Juden, in the late 1930 s the organization sought to resettle German-Jewish farmers, primarily in Paraná, Brazil. The financial arrangement involved the German-Jewish farmers donating their <b>blocked</b> German <b>currency</b> to the Juedische Landarbeit GmbH, which in turn purchased the land and organized the settlements. Some of the settlers were to own the land, and others to farm the land as tenants. Each settlement was to be based on small groups of 40 people, ideally around ten families of four members each. As of 1940, nearly 170 people had signed up, and capital of 150, 000 Reichsmark had been collected. In 1939 the Juedische Landarbeit GmbH found it necessary to form a legal entity in the United States, and the Jewish Agricultural Settlement Corporation (JASC) was founded in New York. Its stated purpose was to regulate the relationship between the land owners and tenants, and complete the responsibility of providing the paid-up capital to the settlers. The initial corporation stockholders and administrators in New York were Frederic Borchardt, Franz Wolf, and Fritz Schwarzschild. Hermann Simon quickly took over for Borchardt. The settlement plan came closest to success in Paraná, Brazil. In 1938, Heinrich Kaphan and Frankfurt attorney Max Hermann Maier moved to Paraná, Brazil, and began making arrangements for the settlers. However, due to difficulties with the Brazilian government, the proposed settlement was never founded. JASC examined other sites in Ecuador and the Dominican Republic, but was unable to found a settlement before the outbreak of war. It became clear around 1941 that creating a settlement in the near future was unlikely. JASC began returning invested funds, and at the request of its investors also shifted them to other organizations such as the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) and the Jewish Colonization Association (JCA, an Argentine settlement organization). However, due to wartime restriction on accounts, full-scale returns were not initiated until 1946. Until its dissolution in 1980, JASC focused on refunding the invested money to the survivors and relatives of those who had invested with the Juedische Landarbeit GmbH. It is not entirely clear from the collection, but it appears that many of the prospective settlers were unable to escape Germany and perished in the Holocaust. In 1947, JASC asked the JDC to take over its accounts, but was not successful. In 1961, the Leo Baeck Institute took over the trust. LBI paid out the last of the claims, and in 1980 JASC was dissolved. In 1961, the trustees were Max Kreutzberger, Max Gruenewald, and Fred W. Lessing. Processeddigitize...|$|R
40|$|Real GDP in {{the industrialized}} {{countries}} is projected to expand by 2 ¾ percent in both 1995 and 1996. Recovery in Europe is set to continue at a healthy pace without gaining further momentum. Overall output growth {{is unlikely to be}} strong enough as to make substantial inroads into the generally high level of unemployment. High interest rates and fiscal retrenchment dampen activity in the countries with weaker currencies; in the strong-currency area, the recent exchange rate shifts constitute a severe test for these countries' external competitiveness. The international business cycle recovery, which became firmly established in 1994, continues. GDP growth in 1995 is projected at 3 percent for both the U. S. and OECD Europe. The U. S. economy has entered a period of slowing activity, caused by endogenous cyclical factors as well as monetary restriction, and the further course of the cycle is not quite clear. The persistent weakness of the dollar vis-à-vis the DM and the yen has been accompanied by exchange rate turbulence within Europe. The <b>block</b> of hard <b>currencies</b> which has emerged since 1992, has appreciated by some 10 percent in real-effective terms against the weaker currencies. Nevertheless, the rate of economic growth is virtually identical for both groups of countries. It is true that the sizeable devaluations have largely contributed towards pulling the weak-currency countries out of the 1992 - 93 recession and that growth continues to be export-driven to a higher degree than in the hard-currency area. However, domestic demand is considerably dampened by high interest rates and the restrictive stance of fiscal policy. The largely productivity-enhancing export growth and weak domestic demand leave little scope for employment gains. Relatively stronger is the performance of domestic demand in the hard-currency countries, thereby partly offsetting the effects of appreciation on activity. Employment, having fallen markedly less than in the weak-currency countries during the recession, increased steadily, if only moderately, in the early upswing, due to firm domestic demand. Price cuts for imports and the slowdown in domestic inflation contribute towards greater price stability in the hard-currency countries. In the weak-currency area inflationary tendencies, which have so far been reined back by the effects of the past recession, are now becoming increasingly apparent.
