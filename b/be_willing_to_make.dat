5|$|Finn and Jake {{venture to}} Tree Trunks's (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) house to acquire apple pie. While there, they {{discover}} that Tree Trunks has {{entered into a}} relationship with Mr. Pig (voiced by Ron Lynch). Finn asks Tree Trunks if she would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> apple pie for Princess Bubblegum's musical concert, to which she agrees. Later at the concert, however, Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig arrive, sans apple pie. During the performance, Mr. Pig and Tree Trunks begin to passionately kiss, which makes the entire audience feel uncomfortable.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} negotiations, {{there was still}} no {{resolution}} within the Kennedy Administration of the question of whether to pursue a comprehensive or partial ban. In an effort to achieve the former, Britain proposed reducing the number of mandated inspections to allay Soviet concerns, but Harriman believed such a reduction would have to be paired with other concessions that Khrushchev would be able to show off within the Soviet Union and to China. Withdrawing PGM-19 Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey would have been an option, had they not already been removed {{in the wake of the}} Cuban Missile Crisis. In meetings prior to the negotiations, Kennedy informed Harriman that he would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> concessions on the Berlin question.|$|E
25|$|In late November 2009 Stephen Harper {{decided that}} he would attend the climate change conference in Copenhagen, where a new {{agreement}} to replace the Kyoto Protocol will be negotiated. Minister of the Environment Jim Prentice will be attending along with leaders of some opposition parties. Harper has claimed that Canada will, despite heavy criticism, not commit to any further emissions reductions and will stick to the current plan of 20% below 2006 levels by 2020, however Harper also said that the government would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> minor changes to the plan. Where the changes would be made is currently unknown.|$|E

25|$|By day 63, Horne was deaf in one ear, {{blind in}} one eye, his liver was failing, {{and he was}} in {{considerable}} pain. A meeting was arranged for day 66 at noon with his supporters to show him the documents that were being faxed through by the Home Office regarding offers the government might <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make.</b> It was agreed that, if there was any substance to them, Horne would call off the strike. Early on the morning of 10 December 1998, the 66th day of his hunger strike, Horne was moved out of hospital and back to Full Sutton Prison. The Home Office said that, because he was refusing treatment, {{there was no need for}} him to be in hospital. By now, Horne was hallucinating and could no longer remember why he was on hunger strike.|$|E
500|$|Hill did {{not want}} an {{extensive}} tour because of obligations to her family and the difficulties she experienced touring with the Fugees in 1996, which she found desensitizing and isolating. According to Hill biographer Chris Nickson in 1999, [...] "there was the possibility of more dates being added... but {{it was unlikely that}} Lauryn would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the tour more grueling and draining. She'd come to know that there was much more to life than a career." ...|$|E
500|$|Baronius' {{exclusion}} by Avila {{led to a}} {{clash with}} Aldobrandini. Both cardinals began raising their voices [...] at each other, stating that they would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the conclave last over a year in order to elect their respective candidates. Avila and Aldobrandini fought a second time, which led to shouting and pushing; the crowds outside took this {{as a sign of}} election by acclamation and opened the doors of the conclave while it was still in session.|$|E

2500|$|He duped Mr. Davis {{with the}} belief that President Lincoln {{regarded}} the condition of Mexico with more concern than the war; that he would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a suspension of hostilities under some sort of collusive contract, and to unite Southern and Northern troops on the Rio Grande for the invasion of Mexico, and that after matters were assured in Mexico affairs might be adjusted here. This was the business at Hampton Roads. I was incredulous, Mr. Hunter did not have faith. Mr. Stephens supposed Blair to be [...] "the mentor of the Administration and Republican party." ...|$|E
2500|$|Künneth {{understood}} that the dogmatic theologian, [...] "of all people", had to <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his views on the Resurrection event precisely and definitively known (p95). For him, the empty tomb was a sign, interpreted by the ophthe to the apostles. The empty tomb expresses Resurrection's [...] "face towards history" [...] (p97), proof that its power touches the vale of tears of matter undergoing history. Yet, God's power is not bound to or by the substratum of Creation. The Resurrection touches history, and lives within it, but is not conditioned by it. In this, he concurs with Bultmann, although he disagrees with Emil Brunner that one cannot make dogmatic, plausible, and adequate statements {{about what happened in}} the Resurrection Ur-Wunder. [...] "It will no longer do to speak vaguely and obscurely about it, as Albert Scweitzer rightly accuses theology of doing" [...] (p95).|$|E
2500|$|The next week, in episodes {{broadcast}} from 9 to 13 July 2012, Jack and Max both witness Kat dancing sexily with Ray, {{and they are}} judgemental of her, which Inside Soap said could be because {{one of them is}} jealous, and Jack keeps [...] "making eyes" [...] at Kat, which could be more revealing than Kat's own actions. They later said that Kat would probably not dance with Ray like that if she was trying to keep an affair with him secret, especially in front of Kim, and said she could have been trying to make either Max or Jack jealous. All About Soap also thought Jack might be jealous, and when he asks Ray if any [...] "hot women" [...] are going to his party, Jack looks at Kat, which they thought could be because Jack hopes Kat will be there. The [...] "sexy dance" [...] between Ray and Kat was interpreted to be either evidence or a red herring, but Inside Soap noted that Kat seems keen to be around Ray. The fact she dances so close to Ray in front of Kim could mean Ray is not her secret lover, but she enjoys danger so may <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a show of herself despite the risk. Kat also tells Kim she is [...] "lucky to have found her prince", which All About Soap thought might mean Kat is jealous, and made him their favourite suspect of the fortnight.|$|E
