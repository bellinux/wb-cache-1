40|$|A {{study of}} 1458 {{patients}} who had undergone <b>breast</b> <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> was conducted to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the technique. The effect of tumour histology and size on the unsatisfactory aspirate and false negative rate was examined. Seven hundred and thirty one patients (50 %) had histological diagnoses. The sensitivity of aspiration cytology for malignancy was 64 % for the first aspiration, but was 91 % in {{patients who had}} had 3 aspirates. The specificity was 56 %, this low figure was almost entirely due to inadequate or unsatisfactory cytological preparations. The positive and negative predictive values of aspiration cytology were 99. 4 % and 85 % respectively demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy given a satisfactory aspirate. Invasive lobular carcinoma yielded a significantly higher unsatisfactory rate than invasive ductal carcinoma (P less than 0. 001) and fibroadenoma yielded a significantly lower unsatisfactory rate than fibroadenosis (P less than 0. 001). Mass size influenced the unsatisfactory rate for invasive ductal carcinoma (P less than 0. 05) and fibroadenoma, but not for invasive lobular carcinoma or fibroadenosis. Only 2 of the 32 false negatives were due to misinterpretation, the remainder resulted from the aspiration needle missing the mass. We conclude that aspiration cytology is an accurate preoperative diagnostic procedure {{for the evaluation of}} breast masses. Unsatisfactory or negative aspirates should be regarded as 'non-results' if there is clinical or radiological suspicion of malignancy...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} "gray zone" in <b>breast</b> fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> {{in which an}} unequivocal {{diagnosis}} cannot be reached with fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> findings. STUDY DESIGN: This study compared cytology and histopathology of 72 breast lesions in which an initial cytologic diagnosis of atypia was given. RESULTS: There were 36 benign (50 %) and 36 malignant (50 %) histologic biopsy cases in the cytologic atypia group. Anisonucleosis, chromatin and nuclear membrane irregularity, and presence of myoepithelial cells were significantly different in benign and malignant cases. CONCLUSION: The gray zone in <b>breast</b> fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> is a broad spectrum that changes from proliferative fibrocystic disease to sclerosing adenosis to malignancy. Diagnosing gray zone pathology as atypical in fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> causes no delay in treatment as excisional biopsy is recommended for all equivocal cases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Primary breast {{lymphoma}} {{is a rare}} condition, and distinguishing it {{from breast}} cancer is important because their treatments differ radically. Moreover, a recent report showed that mastectomy offered no benefit {{in the treatment of}} primary breast lymphoma. Case presentation A 59 -year-old woman was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and local radiation after surgery for left breast cancer. She presented with a rapidly growing mass in the right breast at 20 months after surgery. Mammography and computed tomography revealed a massive tumour. She was diagnosed with primary <b>breast</b> lymphoma by <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology,</b> and surgery was performed. Histopathological and immunohistochemical findings confirmed a diffuse large B-cell type primary breast lymphoma.

40|$|<b>Breast</b> Fine Needle <b>Aspiration</b> <b>Cytology</b> (FNAC) {{represents}} {{first choice}} diagnostic tool to determine mammographic lesions and clinically palpable breast nodules. FNAC is affected anyway {{by a certain}} degree of subjectiveness, that is more evident with the so- called “grey zone” cases (the ones not clearly benign or not clearly malignant) and when there are some doubts about material adequacy. These situations may create some misunderstandings between clinicians and pathologists with possible over or undertreatment for patients. The need for clear communication is extremely important, but it becomes a priority in senology because of the multidisciplinary aspects of the field. For this reasons a breast cytology reporting system has been proposed since 1993 within a U. K. mammographic breast screening programme. From our experience we think only a cytological exam with well demonstrated and well documented quality which satisfies those criteria suggested by guidelines will be able to {{play a key role in}} patients’ clinical management. It will allow reducing as much as possible diagnostic biopsies on benign lesions and frozen sections to confirm malignant lesions.

40|$|Background: Pure mucinous {{carcinoma}} {{is a rare}} histologic type of mammary neoplasm and may exist as mixed mucinous-ductal carcinoma. This study aims to describe fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> features of {{mucinous carcinoma}} of breast diagnosed in Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Nepal over the period of 2 years and to correlate with histological findings. Materials and Methods: There were a total of 8 cases of mucinous carcinoma of breast, diagnosed on fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> in TUTH {{during the period from}} April 2010 to March 2012. The patient’s age, laterality of involvement, fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> features, gross and histological findings, type of surgery performed and tumor size were evaluated. Fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> smears were evaluated for cellularity, amount of mucin, chicken-wire vasculature and nuclear atypia. Results: Fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> provided a pre-operative diagnosis of mucinous carcinoma in 5 cases and mixed mucinous carcinoma-invasive ductal carcinoma in 3 cases. Histological examination showed pure mucinous carcinoma in 3 cases, mixed mucinous carcinoma-invasive ductal carcinoma in 4 cases and mixed cribriform carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in 1 case. Conclusion: Mucinous carcinoma may appear clinically and radiologically benign and fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> plays important role in the correct pre-operative diagnosis. Significant nuclear pleomorphism and necrosis, in addition to extracellular mucin suggests mixed mucinous carcinomainvasive ductal carcinoma.

40|$|Background: Fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> {{has been}} shown to be simple, safe, cost {{effective}} and quick to perform procedure with excellent patient compliance. It is a well established technique for preoperative investigation of thyroid gland swellings with high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> of thyroid swellings performed at our institution. Materials and Methods: This study was carried out at Kathmandu Medical College and Teaching hospital, department of Pathology over a period of 3 years (January 2010 to December 2012). Two hundred and seventy three patients of all age groups and both sexes who underwent fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> for thyroid swelling were evaluated. Out of 273 patients, histopathological diagnosis was available in 45 patients. Results: Fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> result revealed 245 cases (89. 7 %) as non-neoplastic, 21 cases (7. 7 %) as neoplastic and 7 cases (2. 6 %) inadequate due to lack of cellularity. The commonest lesion in the thyroid gland was colloid goiter. Among the malignant neoplasms the commonest was papillary carcinoma. Out of 273 patients, histopathological diagnosis was available in 45 patients. Statistical analysis of our data shows the diagnostic accuracy of fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> to be 95. 7 %.

Factors affecting the reliability of fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> were evaluated by comparing the cytological and biopsy diagnoses and using the clinical parameters in the diagnosis of breast lesions. Result: In our series, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> were 77 %, 99 %, 95 %, 93 %, and 95 %, respectively. The falsenegative diagnosis rate was 4 % and the false-positive diagnosis rate was 1 %. Conclusion: Sampling errors and erroneous interpretation of cellular monomorphism are the most important reasons for false-negative diagnosis results in the evaluation of breast lesions with fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology.</b> Increased cellularity and reactive cell atypia in benign proliferative breast lesions are the most frequent reasons for false-positive diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Fibromatosis-like {{metaplastic}} carcinoma is a newly described metaplastic breast tumor, {{literature on}} {{which is still}} evolving. Case presentation A 77 -year-old lady presented with a 2 × 2 cm mass with irregular margins in the upper and outer quadrant of left <b>breast.</b> Fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> (FNAC) from the lump was inconclusive. A lumpectomy was performed and sent for frozen section, which revealed presence of spindle cells showing mild atypia in a sclerotic stroma. The tumor cells revealed prominent infiltration into the adjacent fat. A differential diagnosis of a low-grade sarcoma vs. a metaplastic carcinoma, favoring the former, was offered. Final histology sections revealed an infiltrating tumor with predominant spindle cells in a collagenous background, simulating a fibromatosis. Adjacent to the tumor were foci of benign ductal hyperplasia and a micropapilloma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed diffuse co-expression of epithelial markers i. e. cytokeratins (CK, HMWCK, CK 7) and EMA along with a mesenchymal marker i. e. vimentin in the tumor cells. Myoepithelial markers (SMA and p 63) showed focal positivity. A diagnosis of a low-grade fibromatosis-like carcinoma breast associated with a micropapilloma was formed. Conclusion Fibromatosis-like carcinoma is a rare form of a metaplastic breast tumor. This diagnosis requires an index of suspicion while dealing with spindle cell breast tumors. The importance of making this diagnosis to facilitate an intra operative surgical planning is marred by diagnostic difficulties. In such cases, IHC is imperative in forming an objective diagnosis. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: A thyroid nodule is {{a common}} {{presentation}} of thyroid disease; the estimated incidence of solitary palpable thyroid nodules in the adult population of the United States varies between 1 % and 10 %. Fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> (FNAC) is the first line diagnostic tool in both solitary and dominant thyroid nodules. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the role of FNAC in diagnosing malignancy in solitary thyroid nodule. Methododology: This descriptive pro and retrospective study {{about the role of}} fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> examination in the diagnosis of solitary thyroid nodule and it`s co-relation with the final histopathological results. The study was carried out during the period June 2009 -August 2010, in the three main histopathology laboratories in Khartoum. Fifty cases of thyroid nodules were studied, thirty eight of them were retrospective and twelve were prospective. Sensitivity, specificity and efficiency of the fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> in diagnosing malignancy were determined. Results: The age of the patients ranged between 18 - 84 years with a mean of 47. 56 years. The commonest age group was 30 – 40 years (24 %). The M: F ratio was 1 : 2. The fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> results were malignant in 64 % while histopathology results were malignant in 76 % with 78 % results showing co-relation. In addition to that, cell block results showing 100 % correlation with histopathology results. Fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> sensitivity was 78. 3 %, specificity 84 %, efficiency 80 %. The study showed that follicular carcinoma was the most common III diagnosis by fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology,</b> it accounts for 32 % followed by papillary carcinoma 24 %. The histopathology results were 24 % and 22 % for follicular and papillary carcinoma respectively. Conclusion: When all the findings in the study were compared together, the efficiency, sensitivity and specificity of the fine needle <b>aspiration</b> <b>cytology</b> tend to be comparable with other studies, in Sudan and elsewhere...|$|R
