5|$|Cerium(IV) aqueous {{solutions}} may {{be prepared}} by reacting cerium(III) solutions {{with the strong}} oxidising agents peroxodisulfate or <b>bismuthate.</b> The value of E⦵(Ce4+/Ce3+) varies widely depending on conditions due to the relative ease of complexation and hydrolysis with various anions, though +1.72V is a usually representative value; that for E⦵(Ce3+/Ce) is −2.34V. Cerium is the only lanthanide which has important aqueous and coordination chemistry in the +4 oxidation state. Due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer, aqueous cerium(IV) ions are orange-yellow. Aqueous cerium(IV) is metastable in water and is a strong oxidising agent that oxidizes hydrochloric acid to give chlorine gas. For example, ceric ammonium nitrate is a common oxidising agent in organic chemistry, releasing organic ligands from metal carbonyls. In the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, cerium oscillates between the +4 and +3 oxidation states to catalyse the reaction. Cerium(IV) salts, especially cerium(IV) sulfate, are often used as standard reagents for volumetric analysis in cerimetric titrations.|$|E

Lead <b>bismuthate</b> glass has a density {{in the range of}} 7.639-7.699 g/cm3 and refractive index within the range of 2.47-2.9. But most importantly lead <b>bismuthate</b> glass has a uniquely large transmitting window, containing wavelengths in the infrared (IR) and UV-visible wavelengths. [...] Due to this, lead <b>bismuthate</b> can be used in spectral devices, such as optical switches and photoionic devices, detection systems based on sensitivity to infrared (IR) and heat radiation, laser materials, optical waveguides, and crystal free fiber drawings. Though unfortunately, lead <b>bismuthate</b> glass cannot form on its own and is rather difficult to make. ¬¬As lead <b>bismuthate</b> melts in the glass forming process, it becomes less stable and tends to crystallize as the temperature decreases, creating a less translucent and glossy product. Lead <b>bismuthate</b> has a high paramagnetic ion content. Thus the lead <b>bismuthate</b> in conjunction with increasing concentrations of metal cation or oxide adducts such as Fe2O3, MnO or Gd2O3 increases the stabilization effect and transmission window of the lead <b>bismuthate</b> resulting in the crystallization of the glass structure. For example, varying the mole percent of Li2O in the lead <b>bismuthate</b> glass with the formula Li2O-Bi2O3-PbO can increase the transmission range to wavelengths beyond 10-15 micrometers in the IR spectra and 420-450 nm in the UV-Vis spectra. Researchers are working to improve lead <b>bismuthate</b> by expanding the transmitting window to fit even more optical applications. Specifically, research has shown that if sufficient amounts of barium and zinc oxides are used simultaneously for the stabilization of lead <b>bismuthate</b> glasses, the decrease in the infrared transmission becomes insignificant compared to the stability of the glass. However, these oxides are not equal and cannot be entirely substituted by each other. Hence, both of them should be available and utilized together to minimize the crystallization and improve the glass stabilization so that there is only a slight decrease is the infrared transmission.|$|E

A major characteristic of these ``edge'' modes is that their energy is essentially insensitive to the doping level, while their intensity increases with the density of interfaces (and thus doping level).

If this procedure would be correct then the standard Eliashberg theory makes any bosonic mechanism of pairing irrelevant. As a consequence we are confronted with a trilemma: (1) to abandon the "Fermi-Bose" division-procedure Kordyuk; (2) to abandon the Eliashberg theory; (3) to abandon the interpretation of ARPES data within the three-step model, where the ARPES intensity is proportional to the quasiparticle spectral function A(k,ω).

40|$|In this {{critical}} review {{we consider the}} large literature that has accumulated in the past 5 - 10 years concerning solution-mediated crystallisation of complex oxide materials using hydrothermal, or more generally solvothermal, reaction conditions. The aim is {{to show how the}} synthesis of dense, mixed-metal oxide materials, usually prepared using the high temperatures associated with solid-chemistry, is perfectly feasible from solution in one step reactions, typically at temperatures as low as 200 degrees C, and that important families of oxide materials have now been reported to crystallise using such synthetic approaches. We will focus on two common structures seen in oxide chemistry, ABO(3) perovskites and A(2) B(2) O(6) O' pyrochlores, and include a systematic survey of the variety of chemical elements now included in these two prototypical structure types, from transition metals, in families of materials that include titanates, niobates, manganites and ferrites, to main-group elements in stannates, plumbates and <b>bismuthates.</b> The significant advantages of solution-mediated crystallisation are well illustrated by the recent literature: examples are provided of elegant control of crystal form from the nanometre to the micron length scale to give thin films, anisotropic crystal morphologies, or hierarchical structures of materials with properties desirable for many important contemporary applications. In addition, new metastable materials have been reported, not stable once high temperatures and pressures are applied and hence not amenable using conventional synthesis. We critically discuss the possible control offered by solvothermal synthesis from crystal chemistry to crystal form and how the discovery of new materials may be achieved. Computer simulation, combinatorial synthesis approaches and in situ methods to follow crystallisation will be vital in providing the predictability in synthesis that is needed for rational design of new materials (232 references). ...|$|R

They {{may be used for}} inferring the heat capacities of ionic solids for which values are unavailable and for checking reported values, thus complementing our independent method of estimation from formula unit volumes (termed volume-based thermodynamics, VBT). Analysis of the reported heat-capacity data presented here provides a new self-consistent set of heat capacities for both cations and anions that is compatible (and thus may be combined) with an extensive set developed by Spencer. The addition of a large range of silicate species permits the estimation of the heat capacities of many silicate minerals. The single-ion heat capacities of individual silicate anions are observed to be strictly proportional to the total number of atoms (Si plus O), n, contained within the silicate anion complex itself (e. g., for the anion Si 2 O 72 –, n = 9, for SiO 42 –, n = 5), Cp(silicate anion) /J K– 1 mol– 1 = 13. 8 n, in a new rule that is an extension of the Neumann–Kopp relationship. The same linear relationship applies to other homologous anion series (for example, oxygenated heavy-metal anion complexes such as niobates, <b>bismuthates,</b> and tantalates), although with a different proportionality constant. A similar proportionality, Cp(complex anion) /J K– 1 mol– 1 ≈ 17. 5 n, which may be regarded as a convenient “rule of thumb”, also applies, although less strictly, to complex anions in general. The proportionality constants reflect the rigidity of the complex anion, being always less than the Dulong–Petit value of 25 J K– 1 mol– 1.

40|$|In this thesis, {{techniques}} of functional integration {{are applied to}} the construction of effective field theories for models of strongly correlated electrons. This is accomplished by means of the Hubbard-Stratonovic transformation which maps a system of interacting fermions onto one of free fermions interacting, not with each other, but with bosonic fields representing the collective modes of the system. Different choices of transformation are investigated throughout the thesis. It is shown that there exists a new group of discrete symmetries and transformations of the Hubbard model. Using this new group, the problem of choosing a Hubbard-Stratonovic decomposition of the Hubbard interaction term is solved. In the context of the exotic doped barium <b>bismuthates,</b> an extended Hubbard model with on-site attraction and nearest neighbour repulsion is studied. Mean field and renormalisation group analyses show a 'pseudospin-flop' from charge density wave to superconductivity as a function of filling. The nearest neighbour attractive Hubbard model on a quasi- 2 D lattice is studied as a simple phenomenological model for the high-T_c cuprates. Mean field theory shows a transition from pure d-wave to pure s-wave superconductivity, via a mixed symmetry s + id state. Using Gaussian fluctuations, the BCS-Bose crossover is examined and suggestions are made about the origin of the angle dependence of the pseudogap. The continuum delta-shell potential model is introduced for anisotropic superconductors. Its mean field phases are studied and found to have some unusual properties. The BCS-Bose crossover is examined and the results are compared with those of the lattice model. Quasi- 2 D (highly anisotropic 3 D) systems are considered. The critical properties of a Bose gas are investigated as the degree of anisotropy is varied. A new 2 D Bose condensate state is found. A renormalisation group analysis is used to investigate the crossover from 2 D to 3 D.
