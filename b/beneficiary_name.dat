50|$|The {{following}} {{information on}} the beneficiary was usually recorded in the diploma: beneficiary's regiment, regimental commander's name, beneficiary's military rank, name of <b>beneficiary,</b> <b>name</b> of beneficiary's father and origin (nation, tribe or city); name of beneficiary's wife and name of her father and origin; and names of children granted citizenship.|$|E
5000|$|The PPA {{provides}} a new mechanism for an IRA {{to be passed}} on to a non-spouse beneficiary. Transferring an IRA account this way can allow better control over when to withdraw (and pay taxes on) the IRA funds. An IRA account can only be passed on once, and it is not directly transferred into the beneficiary's account. Instead, a special IRA account with the heading [...] " [...] Deceased Name For the Benefit of <b>Beneficiary</b> <b>Name</b> [...] " [...] is made to keep the transfer.|$|E
50|$|Notable metal {{documents}} are Roman military diplomas. A diploma was a bronze tablet issued, between c. AD 50 and 212 (when all free {{inhabitants of the}} empire were granted Roman citizenship) to an auxiliary soldier on completion of his 25-year term of service to prove the award of citizenship to the holder and his family. A particular advantage of diplomas for historians {{is that they are}} accurately datable. Diplomas also normally list the names of several auxiliary units which served in the same province at the same time, critical data on the deployment of auxiliary units in the various provinces of the Empire at different times. Also usually recorded are: beneficiary's regiment, regimental commander's name, beneficiary's military rank, name of <b>beneficiary,</b> <b>name</b> of beneficiary's father and origin (nation, tribe or city); name of beneficiary's wife and name of her father and origin; and names of children granted citizenship. Over 800 diplomas have been recovered, although most in a fragmentary state. (Even these, however, represent an infinitesimal fraction of {{the hundreds of thousands of}} diplomas which must have been issued. Apart from natural corrosion, the main reason for this low recovery rate is that, prior due to the late 19th century, when their historical value was recognised, diplomas were almost invariably melted down when found in order to recover their copper content - indeed most were probably melted down in the period following 212).|$|E
50|$|If a <b>beneficiary</b> is <b>named,</b> the {{segregated}} fund investment may {{be exempt from}} probate and executor’s fees and pass directly to the <b>beneficiary.</b> If the <b>named</b> <b>beneficiary</b> is a family member (such as a spouse, child, or parent), the investment may also be secure from creditors in case of bankruptcy. These protections apply to both registered and non-registered investments.|$|R
5000|$|The National Visa Center {{adds the}} <b>beneficiary's</b> <b>name</b> to a queue of people {{awaiting}} immigrant visas. After a wait time (that varies {{based on the}} category), the beneficiary is granted a visa number. Note that IR visas {{are not subject to}} numerical limits, whereas F visas are, but both go through the NVC.|$|R
5000|$|If a {{testator}} leaves {{property in}} a will to several beneficiaries [...] "jointly" [...] {{and one or}} more of those <b>named</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> dies before the will takes effect, then the survivors of those <b>named</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> will inherit the whole property on a joint tenancy basis. But if these <b>named</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> had been bequeathed the property on a tenancy in common basis, but died before the will took effect, then those beneficiaries' heirs would in turn inherit their share immediately (the <b>named</b> <b>beneficiary</b> being deceased).|$|R
30|$|The HC’s {{descriptive}} and spatial information is organised in a property- centred base, thus search {{can be done}} either by the property’s National Cadastre Code Number (KAEK) which is unique to each property, the address or the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E
50|$|A 1997 {{study by}} O'Laoire {{measured}} {{the effects on}} the agents performing daily prayers and reported benefits {{not only for the}} beneficiaries, but also for the agents, and the benefit levels correlated with the belief levels of agents and beneficiaries in some cases. The study measured anxiety and depression. This study used <b>beneficiary</b> <b>names</b> as well as photographs.|$|R
5000|$|Two-step filing (allowed for all categories): The {{petitioner}} files Form I-130, {{and after}} it is approved, the <b>beneficiary's</b> <b>name</b> is added to a queue of people awaiting immigrant visas. After a wait time (that depends on the category), the beneficiary's adjustment of status application {{is ready to be}} processed and the beneficiary files Form I-485 to adjust status to that of a Permanent Resident.|$|R
50|$|Ademption by {{satisfaction}}, {{also known}} as satisfaction of legacies, is a common law doctrine that determines the disposition of property under a will when the testator has made lifetime gifts to <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>named</b> in the will. Under the doctrine, a gift that the maker of the will (the testator) gives during his lifetime to a <b>named</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of the will is treated as an advance payment of that beneficiary's inheritance. If the probate court determines that the testator intended the lifetime gift to satisfy a bequest under the will, {{the amount of the}} lifetime gift is deducted from the amount that the beneficiary would have received under the will.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to {{get a copy of}} the notice of record for an appeal made to AAO by submitting a Freedom of Information Act request to USCIS. However, this {{is not part of the}} appeal timeline, so an appellant cannot use delay in processing of the FOIA to explain delay in submitting any necessary documents. The FOIA can be made by anybody (not necessarily the petitioner or beneficiary); however, key identifying information, including the petitioner's and <b>beneficiary's</b> <b>name,</b> are often redacted.|$|R
50|$|After Elvis Presley's {{death on}} August 16, 1977 at Graceland, his will {{appointed}} his father, Vernon Presley, as executor and trustee. The {{beneficiaries of the}} trust were Vernon, Elvis' grandmother Minnie Mae Presley, and his nine-year-old daughter Lisa Marie Presley. After Vernon's death in 1979, Elvis' ex-wife Priscilla Presley, as Lisa Marie's legal guardian, began comanaging the trust along with the National Bank of Commerce in Memphis, which was the bank Elvis and Vernon had done business with, and Joseph Hanks, who had been Elvis and Vernon's accountant {{for a number of}} years, and formed EPE in 1979. With Minnie Mae's passing in 1980, Lisa Marie became the only surviving <b>beneficiary</b> <b>named</b> in Elvis's will.|$|R
50|$|After Elvis's {{death at}} Graceland on August 16, 1977, his will {{appointed}} his father, Vernon Presley, executor and trustee. His fortune had dwindled to $5 million. The {{beneficiaries of the}} trust were Vernon, Elvis's grandmother Minnie Mae Presley, and his nine-year-old daughter Lisa Marie Presley, whose inheritance was {{to be held in}} trust until her 25th birthday. After Vernon's death in 1979, Elvis's ex-wife Priscilla Presley was named as one of three trustees in his will; the others being the National Bank of Commerce in Memphis, and Joseph Hanks, who had been Elvis and Vernon's accountant. With Minnie Mae's passing in 1980, Lisa Marie became the only surviving <b>beneficiary</b> <b>named</b> in Elvis's will.|$|R
50|$|When {{a person}} dies, the funds in their HSA are {{transferred}} to the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>named</b> for the account. If the beneficiary is a surviving spouse, the transfer is tax-free. If the beneficiary is not a spouse, the account stops being an HSA, and the fair {{market value of the}} HSA (less any unreimbursed qualified medical expenses of the decedent paid within the 1 year anniversary of his death) becomes taxable to the beneficiary in the year in which the HSA owner dies. There is no stretch provision for non-spouse beneficiaries unlike for IRAs and 401ks: when the non-spouse beneficiary inherits, the person pays income tax on the whole amount that year, with no stretching out.|$|R
5000|$|Formerly a {{plaintiff}} had to disavow any {{claim to the}} res in order to avail himself of the interpleader remedy, but this requirement has also been relaxed or abolished in most jurisdictions by there being a Bill in the Nature of Interpleader rather than a strict bill of interpleader. [...] A plaintiff may now argue that neither of the claimants {{has a right to}} the property at issue. For example, a person dies with a life insurance policy that excludes coverage for suicide. Two people come forward claiming to be the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>named</b> in the policy. The insurance company believes that the deceased committed suicide, but the claimants believe the death was by accident. The insurance company could interplead the two claimants and simultaneously deny the claims.|$|R

5000|$|Distributions {{after death}} {{must be made}} to the <b>named</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of the decedent's IRA or {{qualified}} plan. Legislation passed in 2006 allows qualified retirement plans to be amended to offer a [...] "nonspouse rollover." [...] If the rollover is available, the beneficiary may make a direct transfer of the funds to an inherited IRA, which must be {{in the name of the}} decedent for the benefit of the <b>named</b> <b>beneficiary.</b> This became effective beginning in 2007.|$|R
50|$|A second common {{omnibus clause}} {{is used in}} wills. The clause {{distributes}} to the <b>named</b> <b>beneficiary</b> all unnamed assets included in the decedent's estate.|$|R
5000|$|Unimed is a Brazilian medical work {{cooperative}} {{and health insurance}} operator. It is considered the largest {{of its kind in}} the world, with more than 105,000 affiliated physicians, 386 branches and more than 15 million <b>beneficiaries.</b> Its <b>name</b> is a composite of união and médicos (Portuguese for [...] "union" [...] and [...] "physicians").|$|R
5000|$|The {{distinction}} that creates an intended beneficiary {{is that one}} party—the [...] "promisee"—makes an agreement to provide some consideration to a second party—the [...] "promisor"—in exchange for the promisor's agreement to provide some product or service to the third-party <b>beneficiary</b> <b>named</b> in the contract. The promisee must have an intention to benefit the third party (though this requirement has an unusual meaning under the law). Although there is a presumption that the promisor intends to promote {{the interests of the}} third party in this way, if Andrew contracts with Bethany to have a thousand killer bees delivered to the home of Andrew's worst enemy Charlie, then Charlie is still considered to be the intended beneficiary of that contract. (This would be illegal if the intent was to scare his enemy; contracts are voided based on criminality.) ...|$|R
50|$|Countries whose {{legal systems}} {{evolved from the}} British common law system, like the United States, {{typically}} use the probate system for distributing property at death. Probate is a process where 1) the decedent's purported will, if any, is entered in court, 2) after hearing evidence from {{the representative of the}} estate, the court decides if the will is valid, 3) a personal representative is appointed by the court as a fiduciary to gather and take control of the estate's assets, 4) known and unknown creditors are notified (through direct notice or publication in the media) to file any claims against the estate, 5) claims are paid out (if funds remain) in the order or priority governed by state statute, 6) remaining funds are distributed to <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>named</b> in the will, or heirs (next-of-kin) if there is no will, and 7) the probate judge closes out the estate.|$|R

50|$|Step-1 : Customer fills an {{application}} form providing {{details of the}} <b>beneficiary</b> (like <b>name,</b> bank, branch name, IFSC, account type and account number) and the amount to be remitted. The remitter authorizes his/her bank branch to debit his account and remit the specified amount to the beneficiary. This facility is also available through online banking and some banks offer the NEFT facility even through the ATMs.|$|R
50|$|There are exceptions. When {{a spouse}} is the <b>named</b> <b>beneficiary,</b> the account continues, without {{triggering}} taxes, {{in the name}} of the spouse. There are also provisions for the tax-free transfer of assets to minor children, grandchildren and dependents.|$|R
50|$|Personal injury trusts usually carry no UK tax advantages. Compensated {{people need}} {{access to their}} award via their chosen trustees. Thus it is {{essential}} that they retain an interest as a <b>named</b> <b>beneficiary</b> in the award which they settle to form the trust fund.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{modification}} to {{the common}} law of lapse is {{the elimination of the}} [...] "no residue of a residue" [...] rule where multiple <b>beneficiaries</b> are <b>named</b> to inherit the residue. The modern view is that where a beneficiary was intended to inherit part of the residuary estate who predeceases the testator, and that beneficiary is not covered by the anti-lapse statute, then that beneficiary's inheritance will return to the residuary estate, to be inherited by the other beneficiaries to whom the residue has been willed.|$|R

In addition to these major sources of funding, Sepsis Alliance is a <b>named</b> <b>beneficiary</b> from several annual fundraisers, and also generates income from sepsis-related materials purchased by hospitals for use with patients.|$|R
50|$|In Ex parte Stephens' Estate, an {{important}} {{case in the}} South African law of succession, the deceased disposed of his estate in terms of fractions, but only provided for nine tenths of the estate. One tenth, therefore, was not provided for. It was argued {{that it should be}} divided among the <b>named</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> in the will.|$|R
5000|$|Second, {{the donor}} {{maintains}} {{control of the}} account. With few exceptions, the <b>named</b> <b>beneficiary</b> has no rights to the funds. Most plans even allow you to reclaim the funds for yourself any time you desire, no questions asked. However, if a [...] "non-qualified" [...] withdrawal is made, the earnings portion {{will be subject to}} income tax and an additional 10% penalty tax.|$|R
2500|$|A {{trust is}} created by a settlor, who {{transfers}} title to {{some or all of}} his or her property to a trustee, who then holds title to that property in trust {{for the benefit of the}} beneficiaries. The trust is governed by the terms under which it was created. In most jurisdictions, this requires a contractual trust agreement or deed. It is possible for a single individual to assume the role of more than one of these parties, and for multiple individuals to share a single role. [...] For example, in a living trust it is common for the grantor to be both a trustee and a lifetime <b>beneficiary</b> while <b>naming</b> other contingent <b>beneficiaries.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Executory {{interests}} {{are subject to}} the rule against perpetuities, which disqualifies any interest that can vest more than twenty-one years after the death of every party who was living at the time the interest was created. However, if all of the potential vesting <b>beneficiaries</b> are <b>named,</b> the rule will never be violated. Thus, a property can not be conveyed [...] "to A and her heirs, but if alcohol is consumed on the property, to B and his heirs". Because A's heirs may hew to the condition for generations, causing a violation centuries after the condition was set down and creating chaos in efforts to shift title to the appropriate heirs of B.|$|R
