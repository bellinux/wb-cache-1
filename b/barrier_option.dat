Because of the the barrier condition and discreteness of these models the convergence to Black-Scholes model sometimes is slow.

40|$|International audienceDouble <b>barrier</b> <b>options</b> {{have been}} traded {{for a long}} time in the markets and they are {{embedded}} in a variety of popular structured products. However, in their standard form, they lack flexibility inasmuch as they feature a constant barrier level during the entire option life. Step double <b>barrier</b> <b>options</b> overcome this limitation by allowing investors to set the knock-out or knock-in levels they want at the time of their choosing rather than by imposing an arbitrary mathematical form upon the time-varying double barrier. Although step double <b>barrier</b> <b>options</b> are actively traded, no analytical formula is known for their valuation and hedging. In this paper, not only regular step double <b>barrier</b> <b>options</b> are analytically valued, but also more exotic contracts combining periods with and without active barriers as well as step double <b>barrier</b> <b>options</b> written on several assets.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} a {{high-order}} accurate implicit finite-difference approach to the pricing of <b>barrier</b> <b>options.</b> In this way various types of <b>barrier</b> <b>options</b> are priced, including <b>barrier</b> <b>options</b> paying rebates, and options on dividend-paying-stocks. Moreover, the barriers may be monitored either continuously or discretely. In addition to the high-order accuracy of the scheme, and the stretching effect of the coordinate transformation, the main feature of this approach lies on a probability-based optimal determination of boundary conditions. This leads to much faster and accurate results when compared with similar pricing approaches. The strength of the present scheme is particularly demonstrated in the valuation of discretely monitored <b>barrier</b> <b>options</b> where it yields values closest to those obtained from the only semi-analytical valuation method available. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{stochastic}} Dirichlet problem computes values {{within a}} domain of certain functions with known values at {{the boundary of}} the domain. When applied to valuing <b>barrier</b> <b>options,</b> solutions are expressed as expected discounted payo¤s achieved at hitting times to the boundary of the domain. We construct a lattice solution to the stochastic Dirichlet problem. In between time steps on the lattice, the lattice process is assumed to have the bridge distribution of the underlying stochastic process. We apply the Dirichlet lattice to valuing <b>barrier</b> <b>options.</b> A plain simple scheme converges very slowly. We …nd that the Dirichlet lattice is considerably faster than a plain lattice scheme, converging to 2 decimal places in only several hundred time steps. The Dirichlet lattice can directly value knock-in <b>barrier</b> <b>options,</b> including knock-in Bermudan <b>barrier</b> <b>options</b> which cannot normally be priced by a plain lattice method. It values Bermudan <b>barrier</b> <b>options</b> and <b>barrier</b> <b>options</b> with non-linear <b>barriers</b> equally quickly. We present results demonstrating {{the superiority of the}} Dirichlet lattice over both a plain lattice method and a conditional Monte Carlo method.
