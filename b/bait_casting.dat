25|$|Traditionally rods {{are made}} from bamboo, while {{contemporary}} rods are usually made from fibreglass or carbon fibre. In contrast with nets, which are usually used in subsistence and commercial fishing, fishing rods are more often used in recreational fishing and competitive casting. Fishing rods come in many sizes, actions, lengths and configurations depending on whether {{they are to be}} used for small, medium or large fish or in different fresh or salt water situations. Various types of fishing rods are designed for specific types of fishing. Fly rods are used to cast artificial flies, spinning rods and <b>bait</b> <b>casting</b> rods are designed to cast baits or lures. Ice fishing rods are designed to fish through small holes in ice covered lakes. Trolling rods are designed to drag bait or lures behind moving boats.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of sea rods are for surf casting. Surf casting rods {{resemble}} oversized spinning or <b>bait</b> <b>casting</b> rods with long grip handles intended for two-handed casting techniques. Generally between 10 and 14 feet (3–4m) in length, surf casting rods need to be longer in order for the user cast the lure or bait beyond the breaking surf where fish tend to congregate, and sturdy enough to cast heavy weighted lures or bait needed to hold the bottom in rough water. They are almost always used in shore fishing (sea fishing from the shoreline) from the beach, rocks or other shore feature. Some surfcasters use powerful rods to cast up to six ounces or more of lead weight, artificial lures, and/or bait over one hundred yards.|$|E

50|$|As {{with many}} inshore gamefish like {{bluefish}} and striped bass, schools of little tunny are usually indicated by flocks of birds diving in coastal waters. Fishermen targeting them often troll <b>bait,</b> <b>cast</b> lures, and float fish. When trolling for Little Tunny, fishermen often use small lures baited with either mullet or ballyhoo or lures dressed with colored feathers. When float fishing, popular baits are Spot, Bluefish, or Pinfish. Popular lures include deadly dicks, maria jigs, and other slender-profiled, brightly colored metal lures {{that can be}} cast far and retrieved quickly that imitate the small baitfish the little tunny are often feeding on. Some anglers use little tunny for strip bait to catch other species, but most fish are released as the Little Tunny is not commonly {{thought of as a}} food fish. There is little regulation of the fishery, no size or bag limits, and no closed season. The flesh of the Little Tunny is coarse in texture, strong in flavor, and dark in color if compared to bluefin or yellowfin tuna.|$|R

Vom Hofe was a machinist, fishing-tackle builder and noted big-game angler who outfitted the famous anglers of his generation.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, bass fishing had been well {{established}} as a sport with its own following.

2500|$|Spool {{tension on}} most modern baitcasting reels can be {{adjusted}} with adjustable spool tension, a centrifugal brake, or a magnetic [...] "cast control." [...] This reduces spool overrun during a cast and the resultant line snare, known as backlash, colloquially called a [...] "bird's nest" [...] or [...] "birdie". This backlash {{is a result of}} the angular momentum of the spool and line which is not present with a fixed spool or spinning reel. [...] Each time a lure of a different weight is attached, the cast control must be adjusted for the difference in weight.

2500|$|The Baitcasting reel or revolving-spool reel, {{like the}} {{conventional}} reel, is a multiplying reel – {{that is to}} say that the line is stored on a bearing-supported revolving spool that is geared so that a single revolution of the crank handle results in multiple revolutions of the spool. [...] The <b>bait</b> <b>casting</b> reel is mounted above the rod, hence its other name given to it in New Zealand and Australia, the overhead reel. [...] The baitcasting reel dates from at least the mid-17th century, but came into wide use by amateur anglers during the 1870s. [...] Early <b>bait</b> <b>casting</b> reels were often constructed with brass or iron gears, with casings and spools made of brass, German silver, or hard rubber. [...] Featuring multiplying gears ranging from 2:1 to 4:1, these early reels had no drag mechanism, and anglers used their thumb on the spool to provide resistance to runs by a fish. [...] As early as the 1870s, some models used bearings to mount the spool; as the free-spinning spool tended to cause backlash with strong pulls on the line, manufacturers soon incorporated a clicking pawl mechanism. [...] This 'clicker' mechanism was never intended as a drag, but used solely to keep the spool from overrunning, much like a fly reel. [...] Baitcasting reel users soon discovered that the clicking noise of the pawls provided valuable warning that a fish had taken the live bait, allowing the rod and reel to be left in a rod holder while awaiting a strike by a fish.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{variations}} of the revolving spool <b>bait</b> <b>casting</b> reel are the conventional surf fishing reel and the big game reel. These are very large and robust fishing reels, designed and built for heavy saltwater species such as tuna, marlin, sailfish and sharks. [...] Surf fishing reels are normally mounted to long, two-handed rods; these reels frequently omit level-wind and braking mechanisms {{in order to achieve}} extremely long casting distances. [...] Big game reels are not designed for casting, but are instead used for trolling or fishing set baits and lures; they are ideal for fighting large and heavy fish off a pier or boat. [...] These reels normally use sophisticated star or lever drags in order to play out huge saltwater gamefish.|$|E
2500|$|To cast a baitcasting rod and reel, {{the reel}} {{is turned on}} its side, the [...] "free spool" [...] feature engaged, and the thumb placed on the spool to hold the lure in position.

[...] Smallmouth bass are taken for the table, with filets of white, firm flesh when cooked. [...] Today, many fishermen practice catch-and-release fishing to improve fish populations.|$|E
2500|$|Spin casting rods are rods {{designed}} to hold a spin casting reel, which are normally mounted above the handle. Spin casting rods also have small eyes and, frequently, a forefinger grip trigger. They {{are very similar to}} <b>bait</b> <b>casting</b> rods, to the point where either type of reel may be used on a particular rod. While rods were at one time offered as specific [...] "spin casting" [...] or [...] "bait casting" [...] rods, this has become uncommon, as the rod design is suited to either fishing style, and today they are generally called simply [...] "casting rods", and are usually offered with no distinction as to which style they are best suited for in use. Casting rods are typically viewed as somewhat more powerful than their spinning rod counterparts – they can use heavier line and can handle heavier cover.|$|E
2500|$|Spinning reels, {{also called}} fixed spool reels, were {{in use in}} North America {{as early as the}} 1870s. [...] They were {{originally}} developed to allow the use of artificial flies, or other lures for trout or salmon, that were too light in weight to be easily cast by <b>bait</b> <b>casting</b> reels. [...] Fixed-spool or spinning reels are normally mounted below the rod; this positioning conforms to gravity, requiring no wrist strength to maintain the reel in position. [...] For right-handed persons, the spinning rod is held and cast by the strong right hand, leaving the left hand free to operate the crank handle mounted {{on the left side of}} the reel. [...] Invention of the fixed-spool or spinning reel solved the problem of backlash, since the reel had no rotating spool capable of overrunning and fouling the line.|$|E
2500|$|Many of today's baitcasting reels are {{constructed}} using aluminum, stainless steel, and/or synthetic composite materials. [...] They typically include a level-wind mechanism to prevent the line from being trapped under itself on the spool during rewind and interfering with subsequent casts. [...] Many are also fitted with anti-reverse handles and drags designed to slow runs by large and powerful game fish. [...] Because the baitcasting reel uses the weight and momentum of the lure to pull the line from the rotating spool, it normally requires lures weighing 1/4 oz. or more in order to cast a significant distance. [...] Recent developments have seen <b>bait</b> <b>casting</b> reels with gear ratios as high as 7.1/1. [...] Higher gear ratios allow much faster retrieval of line, but sacrifice some amount of strength in exchange, since the additional gear teeth required reduces torque {{as well as the}} strength of the gear train. [...] This could be a factor when fighting a large and powerful fish.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{fishing reels}} are {{suspended}} {{from the bottom of}} the rod, since this position requires no wrist strength to overcome gravity while enabling the angler to cast and retrieve without changing hands. [...] The baitcasting reel's unusual mounting position atop the rod is an accident of history. [...] Baitcasting reels were originally designed to be cast when positioned atop the rod, then rotated upside-down in order to operate the crank handle while playing a fish or retrieving line. [...] However, in practice most anglers preferred to keep the reel atop the rod for both cast and retrieve by simply transferring the rod to the left hand for the retrieve, then reverse-winding the crank handle. [...] Because of this preference, mounting the crank handle on the right side of a <b>bait</b> <b>casting</b> reel (with standard clockwise crank handle rotation) has become customary, though models with left-hand retrieve have gained in popularity in recent years thanks to user familiarity with the spinning reel.|$|E
2500|$|Spinning rods {{are made}} from {{graphite}} or fiberglass with a cork or PVC foam handle, and tend to be between 5 and 8.5 feet (1.5–2.6 m) in length. Typically, spinning rods have anywhere from 5-8 guides arranged along {{the underside of the}} rod to help control the line. The eyes decrease in size from the handle to the tip, with the one nearest the handle usually much larger than the rest to allow less friction as the coiled line comes off the reel, and to gather the very large loops of line that come off the spinning reel's spool. Unlike <b>bait</b> <b>casting</b> and spin casting reels, the spinning reel hangs beneath the rod rather than sitting on top, and is held in place with a sliding or locking reel seat. The fisherman's second and third fingers straddle the [...] "leg" [...] of the reel where it is attached to the reel seat on the rod, and the weight of the reel hangs beneath the rod, which makes for a more comfortable way to fish for extended periods. This also allows the rod to be held in the fisherman's dominant hand (the handle on most modern spinning reels is reversible) which greatly increases control and nuance applied to the rod itself. Spinning rods and reels are widely used in fishing for popular North American sport fish including bass, trout, pike and walleye. Popular targets for spinning in the UK and European continent are pike, perch, eel and zander (walleye). Longer spinning rods with elongated grip handles for two-handed casting are frequently employed for saltwater or steelhead and salmon fishing. Spinning rods are also widely used for trolling and still fishing with live bait.|$|E
