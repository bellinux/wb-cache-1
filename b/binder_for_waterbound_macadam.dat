40|$|<b>Waterbound</b> <b>Macadam</b> (WM) layers {{were used}} {{extensively}} {{during the first}} half of the previous century and have been reintroduced in the 1980 ’s, focusing on re-engineering labour-intensive construction techniques during the 1990 ’s. In 1994 and 1995 the former Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council (TMC) in consultation with AFRICON and the University of the Witwatersrand constructed two pilot projects in Johannesburg with a labour-based method utilising WM base courses. The design and construction of various WM roads in Soweto followed in 1996. The construction processes were monitored throughout and data collected to investigate certain technical issues; among them the in-situ WM properties, the construction tolerances and expected performance. Since that time, a number of WM projects followed towards the development of sound guidelines for the design and construction of these pavements. A case study was conducted in 2001 on eight of these <b>waterbound</b> <b>macadam</b> pavements to assess the in-service short-term performance, and re-visiting the expected structural capacity by applying state of the art techniques in the analysis of these layers.

40|$|The present chapter {{focuses on}} locks {{and their impact}} on (inland) waterbound logistics. Examples of lock systems are given, and the main {{characteristics}} of the serial lock scheduling problem discussed. Locks are often scheduled manually and, despite constituting a complex combinatorial problem, academia has given little attention to optimizing lock operations. Two measures can be suggested to considerably improve the competitiveness of inland waterway transportation within the supply chain: increasing the scheduling horizon of locks and treating series of locks as a single system, instead of operating them individually. A decision support system for the ship placement problem is introduced. The system is analysed both from the algorithmic and operational side, and some implementation difficulties are highlighted. Transferring ships through a series of locks based on their requested time of arrival at a destination, has potential to generate a green wave <b>for</b> <b>waterbound</b> logistics. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Bitumen (asphalt) is viscoelastic, {{rheological}} and {{non-magnetic material}} composed of heavy hydrocarbons with low dielectric constant (e'). It is {{a by-product of}} petroleum oil refinery. Though it {{is used as a}} <b>binder</b> <b>for</b> flexible pavement all over the world, it has severe environmental impacts. Bitumen is non-hazardous at room temperature but when heated at 165 - 200 °C, it becomes toxic. Consequences, such as environmental degradation, depleting petroleum reserves and price-spiking, led researchers to explore alternative sources of obtaining <b>binder</b> <b>for</b> pavement. This paper provides an overview of the probable materials that could be used as an alternative binder. The materials obtained from bio-based sources, such as bio-oil, polymer, plastic, rubber and waste cooking oil and retrieved from waste material show promise and discussed. Further research is needed to make them satisfactory replacement of bitumen on an industrial scale, and be a sustainable source of <b>binder</b> <b>for</b> flexible pavement...|$|R
