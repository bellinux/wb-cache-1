40|$|A {{complete}} {{homologous series}} of fluorescent phosphatidylethanolamines (diCnPE), labelled {{at the head}} group with a 7 -nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazo- 4 -yl(NBD) fluorophore and inserted in 1 -palmitoyl, 2 -oleoyl-snglycero- 3 -phosphocholine (POPC) bilayers, was studied using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The longer-chained derivatives of NBD-diCnPE, with n = 14, 16, and 18, are commercially available, and widely used as fluorescent membrane probes. Properties such as location of atomic groups and acyl chain order parameters of both POPC and NBD-diCnPE, fluorophore orientation and hydrogen <b>bonding,</b> <b>membrane</b> electrostatic potential and lateral diffusion were calculated for all derivatives in the series. Most of these probes induce local disordering of POPC acyl chains, {{which is on the}} whole counterbalanced by ordering resulting from binding of sodium ions to lipid carbonyl/glycerol oxygen atoms. An exception is found for NBD-diC 16 PE, which displays optimal matching with POPC acyl chain length and induces a slight local ordering of phospholipid acyl chains. Compared to previously studied fatty amines, acyl chain-labelled phosphatidylcholines, and sterols bearing the same fluorescent tag, the chromophore in NBD-diCnPE locates in a similar region of the membrane (near the glycerol backbone/carbonyl region) but adopts a different orientation (with the NO 2 group facing the interior of the bilayer). This modification leads to an inverted orientation of the P–N axis in the labelled lipid, which affects the interface properties, such as the membrane electrostatic potential and hydrogen bonding to lipid head group atoms. The implications of this study for the interpretation of the photophysical properties of NBD-diCnPE (complex fluorescence emission kinetics, differences with other NBD lipid probes) are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Immobilized {{artificial}} membranes (IAMs) emulate biological membranes and {{are currently}} being exploited to (i) predict the passive transport of drugs through cell membranes and (ii) purify membrane proteins. ^ IAMs are prepared by <b>bonding</b> <b>membrane</b> lipids containing an ω-carboxyl group on the hydrocarbon chain to solid surfaces with the lipid correctly oriented after bonding. IAM surfaces with two acyl chains were prepared by immobilizing analogs of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) onto silica propylamine. PLs that require protection/deprotection during the preparation were enzymatically synthesized using phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) and phospholipase D (PLD). The IAM surfaces made are designated as esterIAMs. Single chain ether phospholipids containing ω-carboxyl groups in the alkyl chain were also immobilized to prepare etherIAMs. Both FTIR spectroscopy and elemental analysis indicated that the bonding densities for the immobilized PLs {{are very close to}} the density of phospholipids found in fluid liposome membranes. ^ Studies elucidating the affinity of IAMs for proteins utilized PLA 2 as a model protein. The elution conditions common to conventional chromatographic methods were evaluated for their ability to selectively purify PLA 2. Elution conditions tested included (i) detergent gradients, (ii) salt gradients, (iii) acetonitrile gradients, and (iv) a two step gradient consisting of a detergent gradient followed by an acetonitrile gradient. PLA 2 from Sigma was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity with a 417 -fold increase in specific activity in one step and PLA 2 from a freshly prepared mixture was purified in one step with a 660 -fold increase in specific activity. A key implication from this work is that IAMs may have particularly good utility in purifying peripheral membrane proteins. ^ Aside from PLA 2, N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine synthase (NAPES) was purified using IAMs. NAPES is a membrane bound enzyme present in cotton seedlings at trace concentrations, and it catalyzes acylation of the amino group of membrane PE. NAPES was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity in a single chromatographic step using etherIAM PECC 10 /C 3. Dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE), the natural substrate, was required in the mobile phase for elution of optimum functional activity. DMPE functions as both a surfactant-type affinity displacing ligand effecting protein elution and a stabilizing factor of NAPES functional activity during chromatography. This one step IAM purification of NAPES resulted in a 3940 -fold increase in NAPES specific activity. The molecular weight of the purified NAPES protein is 64, 000. ^ In summary, new IAM surfaces are being synthesized that allow solving several biological problems which include protein purifications. ...|$|E

40|$|We present two {{transfer}} bonding {{schemes for}} incorporating fragile nanoporous inorganic membranes into microdevices. Such membranes are finding increasing use in microfluidics, {{due to their}} precisely controllable nanostructure. Both schemes rely on a novel dual-cure dry adhesive bonding method, enabled by a new polymer formulation: OSTE(+), which can form bonds at room temperature. OSTE(+) is a novel dual-cure ternary monomer system containing epoxy. After the first cure, the OSTE(+) is soft and suitable for bonding, while during the second cure it stiffens and obtains a Young's modulus of 1. 2 GPa. The ability of the epoxy to react with almost any dry surface provides a very versatile fabrication method. We demonstrate the transfer bonding of porous silicon and porous alumina membranes to polymeric microfluidic chips molded into OSTE(+), and of porous alumina membranes to microstructured silicon wafers, by using the OSTE(+) as a thin bonding layer. We discuss the OSTE(+) dual-cure mechanism, describe the device fabrication and evaluate the <b>bond</b> strength and <b>membrane</b> flow properties after <b>bonding.</b> The <b>membranes</b> <b>bonded</b> to OSTE(+) chips delaminate at 520 kPa, and the <b>membranes</b> <b>bonded</b> to silicon delaminate at 750 kPa, well above typical maximum pressures applied to microfluidic circuits.

40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to draw a profile of {{adenosine}} triphosphate (ATP) and to project its many actions. The amazing versatility of its participation {{in a number of}} synthetic reactions lies in the oligophosphate structure. Many proteins that use ATP have conserved binding 'P-loop' but this gives no clue what makes it so special. The energy transducing reactions leading to synthesis of the terminal phosphodiester had at least three strategies.

FMC is a desirable acquisition mode for automated scanning of complex geometries, as it allows compensation for surface shape in post processing and application of the total focusing method. However, automating the delivery of such FMC inspection remains a significant challenge for real industrial processes due to the high data overhead associated with the ultrasonic acquisition. The benefits of NDE delivery using six-axis industrial robots are well versed when considering complex inspection geometries, but such an approach brings additional challenges to scanning speed and positional accuracy when combined with FMC inspection.
