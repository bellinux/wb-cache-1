25|$|However several {{attempts}} were made to combat commercial poaching of animals.

25|$|The genre took a huge dip in {{popularity}} {{with the emergence}} of Arabesque music. However, with Aksu backing emerging stars such as Sertab and Tarkan in the early 1990s, Turkish pop came <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink.</b> In particular, Tarkan's song Şımarık, which was both written and composed by Aksu, was a hit in Europe and Latin America in 1999.|$|E
50|$|In 1948, a U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} forced {{movie studios}} to divest themselves of their profitable theater chains. The loss of these theaters and the competitive pressure of television caused significant financial distress for many American motion picture studios. In 1952 {{the launch of}} Cinerama was a public sensation and suggested {{a way to bring}} studios <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> financial <b>brink,</b> but <b>the</b> cameras were heavy, bulky, and difficult to use. Installing Cinerama in a theater was no simple matter either, as the system required three projectors, each in its own projection booth, as well as an elaborate 7-channel sound system and a special large, deeply curved, screen.|$|R
25|$|Apollo {{carried the}} baby to the centaur Chiron who raised Asclepius and {{instructed}} him {{in the art of}} medicine. It is said that in return for some kindness rendered by Asclepius, a snake licked Asclepius's ears clean and taught him secret knowledge (to the Greeks snakes were sacred beings of wisdom, healing, and resurrection). Asclepius bore a rod wreathed with a snake, which became associated with healing. A species of non-venomous pan-Mediterranean serpent, the Aesculapian snake (Zamenis longissimus) is named for the god.Asclepius became so proficient as a healer that he surpassed both Chiron and his father, Apollo. Asclepius was therefore able to evade death and to bring others <b>back</b> to life <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of death and beyond. This caused an influx of human beings and Zeus resorted to killing him to maintain balance in the numbers of the human population.|$|R
50|$|The {{species was}} thought to have {{disappeared}} from Cambodia until it was rediscovered in 2001. Conservationists eventually began tagging the animals with tracking devices and monitoring their nests, and King Norodom Sihamoni personally ordered their protection.Its eggs were a delicacy of the royal cuisine of Cambodia; In 2005, it was designated the national reptile of the Cambodia {{in an effort to}} bring awareness and conservation for this species. In July 2015, conservationists in Cambodia cautiously stated that efforts to bring <b>back</b> <b>the</b> species <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of extinction were having some success. A number of turtles, including breeding pairs, have been moved from enclosed areas into their intended home, the rivers and shores of Koh Kong where, it is hoped - with the ongoing monitoring and protection of locals and conservationists - they will begin to flourish.|$|R
25|$|The zoo {{was among}} the first zoos in the world to breed white tigers and the common {{reticulated}} giraffe. While it has successfully bred some megafauna, its rate of breeding rare species had not been very successful, often due to lack of initiative and funding. One notable exception is the breeding programme of the Manipur brow-antlered deer, or thamin which has been brought <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of extinction by the breeding program at the Alipore Zoo.|$|E
25|$|Political leaders {{soon began}} to use the annual meeting as a neutral platform. The Davos Declaration was signed in 1988 by Greece and Turkey, helping them turn <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of war. In 1992, South African President F. W. de Klerk met with Nelson Mandela and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi at the annual meeting, their first joint {{appearance}} outside South Africa. At the 1994 annual meeting, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat reached a draft agreement on Gaza and Jericho.|$|E
25|$|Chief Waramaug watched sadly as {{once more}} his daughter's health began to fail and her usually happy {{disposition}} to turn morose under mounting waves of despondency. Perhaps, he thought, he might bring her <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of deep depression {{if he could}} only interest her in a young man of her own race. So, unknown to Lillinonah, Waramaug arranged a marriage for her with Eagle Feather, one of the brightest, most promising braves in the Pootatuck tribe. Surely, such a fine youth as he, could give Lillinonah something to live for.|$|E
40|$|The Great Financial Crisis {{has been}} touted {{to be the}} worst crisis since the Great Depression of 1930; its effect has {{profound}} ramifications on the global economy. The nature and the severity of the crisis provoked an unprecedented policy response from policy makers at both global and domestic levels. To address the rampaging crisis, the Bank of England implemented a number of conventional and unconventional policy measures to curtail the economic rot and to stimulate economic growth. There is a broad consensus in the empirical literature and other evidence found in this paper that a number of the policies implemented in the United Kingdom {{played a significant role in}} re-directing and stimulating the economy. This paper reviews the various policy measures adopted by the Bank of England <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inception of the financial crisis in 2008 and assesses their effectiveness in bringing <b>back</b> <b>the</b> economy <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of collapse. Our review shows that quantitative easing (QE) policy and the expansionary fiscal policy adopted by the Bank of England were effective policy tools used in stimulating economic growth, stemming the effect and shortening the duration of the crisis in the United Kingdom </p...|$|R
40|$|As Ireland {{heads for}} 21 years of social partnership, new {{questions}} {{are being asked}} {{about the role of}} social partnership in transforming Ireland from an economic basket case to a model of economic development and full employment. "Saving the Future: How Social Partnership Shaped Ireland's Economic Success" tells - for the first time - the inside story of this unique period {{through the eyes of the}} men and women who made it happen. Drawing on new insights from ministers, business leaders, top civil servants and trade union leaders, it charts the background to the first national agreement in 1987 and the acceptance among these diverse groups of a deceptively simple economic formula and new articles of faith, which brought Ireland <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> economic <b>brink.</b> It's a book for people who want to fully understand the success of the Irish economy, and the contribution of the unique social partnership model to that success. The book does not claim that social partnership was solely responsible for the Irish economic miracle. Rather it suggests that it is now part of the fabric of our political, economic and social life and it has made a significant contribution to shaping modern Ireland. "Saving the Future" seeks to fill a significant gap in the discourse about our recent economic and social history, which often ignores or downplays the importance of social partnership <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mid- 1980 s to the present day. Written by the leading industrial journalists who tracked the ups and downs of the period, the book describes the most dynamic years of Ireland's economic development through the eyes of those who helped to shape it. The authors uncovered a rich seam of material as they interviewed 40 of the top politicians, business leaders, civil servants, and trade unionists who conceived and developed Irish social partnership. The authors' focus has inevitably been on the economy, especially pay, employment, living standards and industrial relations. They tell the story of social partnership <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inside, providing insight into key development and themes that marked the period...|$|R

In the 1980s, Nawat had about 200 speakers. By 2009, 3,000 people were participating in Nawat language learning programs, the vast majority being young people, giving rise to hopes that the language might be pulled <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of extinction.|$|E
25|$|In April 1921 the Cabinet decided, against Wilson’ advice, to {{withdraw}} 4 of Macready’s 51 battalions, {{to meet the}} possible Triple Alliance strike. Wilson drew up plans to send an extra 30 battalions to suppress Ireland once the strike and the Irish elections {{were out of the}} way, not least as troops would otherwise need to be replaced after the strain of guerrilla war. In the event 17 battalions were sent (bringing British strength up to 60,000) in June and July, but the politicians drew <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> and began secret talks with James Craig and Éamon de Valera.|$|E

Henry's preceding speech to Suffolk, where he demands Suffolk not look at him, and then immediately demands {{that he wants to}} look into Suffolk's eyes was played by Alan Howard {{in such a way as}} to suggest that Henry was losing his grip on reality, and in response to this, Mirren played the speech in such a way as to engage Henry's mind in the here and now, focus his thoughts and prevent them drifting away.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the war had}} {{severely}} exhausted the Dutch finances, the pacification of Java {{enabled the}} colonial government of Dutch East Indies to implement Cultuurstelsel ("The Culture System") in Java, without any local opposition. Implemented in 1830 by the new governor general, Johannes van den Bosch, this cultivation system requires 20% of village land had to be devoted to government crops for export or, alternatively, peasants had to work in government-owned plantations for 60 days of the year. The policy brought the Dutch and their native allies enormous wealth through the export of cash crops. It brought the Netherlands <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of bankruptcy, and made the Dutch East Indies a self-sufficient and profitable colony.|$|E
25|$|Habitats and biota do {{frequently}} change. Therefore, {{it follows}} that the process of adaptation is never finally complete. Over time, it may happen that the environment changes little, and the species comes to fit its surroundings better and better. On the other hand, it may happen that changes in the environment occur relatively rapidly, and then the species becomes less and less well adapted. Seen like this, adaptation is a genetic tracking process, which goes on all the time to some extent, but especially when the population cannot or does not move to another, less hostile area. Given enough genetic change, as well as specific demographic conditions, an adaptation may be enough to bring a population <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of extinction in a process called evolutionary rescue. It should be noted that adaptation does affect, to some extent, every species in a particular ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July 1980, Vysotsky gave a {{performance}} at a suburban Moscow concert hall. One {{of the stage}} managers recalls that he looked visibly unhealthy ("gray-faced", as she puts it) and complained of not feeling too good, while another says she was surprised by his request for champagne {{before the start of}} the show, as he had always been known for completely abstaining from drink before his concerts. On 16 July Vysotsky gave his last public concert in Kaliningrad. On 18 July, Vysotsky played Hamlet for the last time at the Taganka Theatre. From around 21 July, several of his close friends were on a round-the-clock watch at his apartment, carefully monitoring his alcohol intake and hoping against all odds that his drug dependency would soon be overcome and they would then be able to bring him <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink.</b> The effects of drug withdrawal were clearly getting the better of him, as he got increasingly restless, moaned and screamed in pain, and at times fell into memory lapses, failing to recognize at first some of his visitors, including his son Arkadiy. At one point, Vysostsky's personal physician A. Fedotov (the same doctor who had brought him back from clinical death a year earlier in Uzbekistan) attempted to sedate him, inadvertently causing an asphyxiation from which he was barely saved. On 24 July, Vysotsky told his mother that he thought he was going to die that day, and then made similar remarks to a few of the friends present at the apartment, who begged him to stop such talk and keep his spirits up. But soon thereafter, Oksana Afanasyeva saw him clench his chest several times, which led her to suspect that he was genuinely suffering from a cardiovascular condition. She informed Fedotov of this, but was told not to worry, as he was going to monitor Vysotsky's condition all night. In the evening, after drinking relatively small amounts of alcohol, the moaning and groaning Vysotsky was sedated by Fedotov, who then sat down on the couch next to him but fell asleep. Fedotov awoke in the early hours of 25 July to an unusual silence, and found Vysotsky dead in his bed with his eyes wide open, apparently of a myocardial infarction, as he later certified. This was contradicted by Fedotov's colleagues, Sklifosovsky Emergency Medical Institute physicians L. Sul'povar and S. Scherbakov (who had demanded the actor's instant hospitalization on 23 July, but were, allegedly, defied by Fedotov), who insisted that Fedotov's incompetent sedation combined with alcohol was what killed Vysotsky. An autopsy was prevented by Vysotsky's parents (who were eager to have their son's drug addiction remain secret), so the true cause of death remains unknown.|$|E

500|$|In 212, {{during the}} reign of Caracalla, Roman {{citizenship}} was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire. But despite this gesture of universality, the Severan dynasty was tumultuous—an emperor's reign was ended routinely by his murder or execution—and, following its collapse, the Roman Empire was engulfed by the Crisis of the Third Century, a period of invasions, civil strife, economic disorder, and plague. In defining historical epochs, this crisis is sometimes viewed as marking the transition from Classical Antiquity to Late Antiquity. Aurelian (reigned 270–275) brought the empire <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> and stabilized it. Diocletian completed the work of fully restoring the empire, but declined the role of princeps and became the first emperor to be addressed regularly as domine, [...] "master" [...] or [...] "lord".

500|$|There are {{multiple}} endings {{based on whether}} the player caused high chaos by indiscriminate murder, or achieved low chaos by refraining from taking lives. In the High Chaos ending, the player is faced with the choice of freeing Emily / Corvo from petrification or leaving them that way forever. If Emily is not left in stone, she becomes a vengeful empress and brutally purges Delilah's supporters, with Corvo by her side {{in one form or}} another. If Corvo leaves Emily petrified, he takes the throne for himself and becomes a brutal tyrant known as Emperor Corvo [...] "the Black". Meanwhile, Karnaca is either ruled by a new tyrant or collapses completely into anarchy and, if still alive, Sokolov becomes a broken man after having borne witness to the perversion of his work and is exiled to his home country. In the Low Chaos ending, the player frees Emily / Corvo from their imprisonment. A council of representatives takes charge in Karnaca and brings the city <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink.</b> Emily becomes a fair and just ruler, reuniting the Empire with Corvo by her side.
