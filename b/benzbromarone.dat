50|$|<b>Benzbromarone</b> (INN) is a {{uricosuric}} agent and non-competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase {{used in the}} treatment of gout, especially when allopurinol, a first-line treatment, fails or produces intolerable adverse effects.

5000|$|In general, {{uricosuric}} drugs act on {{the proximal}} tubules in the kidneys, where they interfere with the absorption of uric acid from the kidney back into the blood. Several uricosurics are known to act in vitro by blocking the function of a protein encoded by the gene SLC22A12, also known as urate transporter 1 or URAT1. URAT1 is the central mediator in the transport of uric acid from the kidney into the blood. In some persons with loss-of-function mutations of URAT1, the uricosurics <b>benzbromarone</b> and losartan had no effect, suggesting these drugs act on URAT1 in vivo. [...] Thus, uricosuric drugs may be candidates for management in a personalized medicine model.|$|E
40|$|Sporadic {{reports of}} mild hepatic {{dysfunction}} as an adverse reaction of <b>Benzbromarone</b> {{have appeared in}} recent years, and in some cases, fulminant hepatitis has developed. We first investigated metabolites of <b>Benzbromarone,</b> using LC/MS, and identified the metabolites of <b>Benzbromarone</b> in vitro. Results showed that human liver S 9 metabolites of <b>Benzbromarone</b> consist of two hydroxy bodies, two monohydroxy bodies and five 1 ’-ketone bodies; previous reports (except that debromination products were not detected) suggest that Benzarone (possibly related to hepatotoxicity) is not formed in humans. We also identified CYP molecular species related to the metabolism of <b>Benzbromarone,</b> by use of a human P 450 -expressing microsome system. We found that <b>Benzbromarone</b> is metabolized by CYP 2 C 9 * 1 and 2 C 9 * 2, and the main metabolite is 6 -hydroxylbenzbromarone. A study of the inhibitory action of <b>Benzbromarone</b> on human P 450 molecular species showed that <b>Benzbromarone</b> has especially potent inhibitory action on CYP 2 C 8 / 9. Therefore, {{it was clear that}} <b>Benzbromarone</b> is metabolized by CYP 2 C 9 and inhibits CYP 2 C 8 and CYP 2 C 9. Deaths caused by fulminant hepatitis in patients given the antidiabetic troglitazone (Noscal), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) -γ agonist, have recently been reported. It has also been reported that the mechanism of onset is by the induction of hepatocellular apoptosis by excessive increase of PPAR-γ activity. Because <b>Benzbromarone</b> has long been considered to be a peroxisome proliferating agent, we studied the action of <b>Benzbromarone</b> on PPAR-α and PPAR-γ. The results indicated that <b>Benzbromarone</b> is a ligand of PPAR-α. Our results suggest that the hepatic dysfunction associated with <b>Benzbromarone</b> is not caused by apoptosis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Benzbromarone,</b> a {{uricosuric}} drug, reportedly causes hepatic hypertrophy {{accompanied by}} proliferation of peroxisomes in rats. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying induction of peroxisome proliferation by <b>benzbromarone,</b> we examined binding affinity for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ÃŽÂ± (PPARÃŽÂ±) and ÃŽÂ³ (PPARÃŽÂ³), and {{effects on the}} binding activity of PPARs with peroxisome proliferation-responsive element (PPRE) and expression of the PPARs target protein. Binding affinity of <b>benzbromarone</b> for PPARÃŽÂ± and PPARÃŽÂ³ was examined by reporter gene assay. Binding activity of PPARs with PPRE was determined by electric mobility shift assay, and expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) by Western blot method. <b>Benzbromarone</b> displayed affinity for PPARÃŽÂ± and PPARÃŽÂ³, and promoted binding of PPARs to PPRE. Furthermore, cultured cells with <b>benzbromarone</b> added showed upregulated expression of LPL and ACS.

40|$|The {{tyrosine}} {{phosphatase activity}} of the phosphatase-transactivator protein Eyes Absent (EYA) is angiogenic through its roles in endothelial cell migration and tube formation. <b>Benzbromarone,</b> a known anti-gout agent, was previously identified as an inhibitor of EYA with anti-angiogenic properties. Here we show that the major metabolite of BBR, 6 -hydroxy <b>benzbromarone,</b> is a significantly more potent inhibitor of cell migration, tubulogenesis and angiogenic sprouting. In contrast, other postulated metabolites of BBR such as 5 -hydroxy benzbromaorne and 1 ’-hydroxy <b>benzbromarone</b> are less potent inhibitors of EYA tyrosine phosphatase activity {{as well as being}} less effective in cellular assays for endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. Longer substituents at the 2 position of the benzofuran ring promoted EYA 3 binding and inhibition, but were less effective in cellular assays, likely reflecting non-specific protein binding and a resulting reduction in free, bio-available inhibitor. The observed potency of 6 -hydroxy <b>benzbromarone</b> is relevant {{in the context of the}} potential re-purposing of <b>benzbromarone</b> and its derivatives as anti-angiogenic agents. 6 -hydroxy <b>benzbromarone</b> represents a metabolite with a longer half-life and greater pharmacological potency than the parent compound, suggesting that biotransformation of <b>benzbromarone</b> could contribute to its therapeutic activity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Benzbromarone</b> is an {{uricosuric}} structurally {{related to}} amiodarone and a known mitochondrial toxicant. The {{aim of the}} current study was to improve our understanding in the molecular mechanisms of benzbromarone-associated hepatic mitochondrial toxicity. In HepG 2 cells and primary human hepatocytes, ATP levels started to decrease in the presence of 25 - 50 μM <b>benzbromarone</b> for 24 - 48 h, whereas cytotoxicity was observed only at 100 μM. In HepG 2 cells, <b>benzbromarone</b> decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential starting at 50 μM following incubation for 24 h. Additionally, in HepG 2 cells, 50 μM <b>benzbromarone</b> for 24 h induced mitochondrial uncoupling,and decreased mitochondrial ATP turnover and maximal respiration. This was accompanied by an increased lactate concentration in the cell culture supernatant, reflecting increased glycolysis as a compensatory mechanism to maintain cellular ATP. Investigation of the electron transport chain revealed a decreased activity of all relevant enzyme complexes. Furthermore, treatment with <b>benzbromarone</b> was associated with increased cellular ROS production, which could be located specifically to mitochondria. In HepG 2 cells and in isolated mouse liver mitochondria, <b>benzbromarone</b> also reduced palmitic acid metabolism due to an inhibition of the long-chain acyl CoA synthetase. In HepG 2 cells, <b>benzbromarone</b> disrupted the mitochondrial network, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and a decreased mitochondrial volume per cell. Cell death occurred by both apoptosis and necrosis. The study demonstrates that <b>benzbromarone</b> not only affects the function of mitochondria in HepG 2 cells and human hepatocytes, but is also associated with profound changes in mitochondrial structure which may be associated with apoptosis...|$|E

Since Benzbromaronef selectively inhibits tubular reabsorption of secreted urate, the maximum uricosuria induced by this drug can be equated with the minimal secretory rate. Furthermore, a signif icant relationship was noted in normal controls betw een urate secretion and the plasma urate concentration (r = 0. 956, p < 0. 005). Using the <b>Benzbromarone</b> response {{as a measure of}} tubular secretion, gouty patients with normal production hyperuricemia had a significantly lower secretory rate by comparison to patients with overproduction of uric acid.

40|$|Introduction Numerous {{publications}} identify that gout {{management is}} often sub-optimal, despite detailed {{understanding of the}} pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder, the ability to establish the diagnosis with certainty, and the likely effectiveness of lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Barriers to successful gout management include diagnostic inaccuracy, a paucity of guidelines, sub-optimal patient education and patient adherence, co-morbidities and drug-drug interferences that complicate treatment of gout, and limited urate-lowering alternatives. Furthermore, a lack of information exists on the risk-benefit ratios of antihyperuricemic drugs for gout treatment. This thesis studies the clinical pharmacology of antihyperuricemic dugs {{in the treatment of}} gout in clinical practice, with focus on efficacy and tolerability. Studies and reviews of this thesis focus on: management of gout, outcome research with antihyperuricemic drugs, therapeutic drug monitoring of allopurinol, and rasburicase for treatment of gout. Management of gout In chapter 2. 1, we reviewed the literature on management of gout and presented a therapeutic strategy. Limited information on drugs indicated for the treatment of gout is available, making it difficult for physicians to make informed treatment decisions. The current therapeutic strategy is often based on clinical experience. Lifestyle advice is of limited value in the prevention of gout, particularly with regard to restricting alcohol, losing weight in cases of obesity, ensuring adequate diuresis and adhering to a low-purine diet, as most patients are reluctant to make such changes. Therefore, the condition is often treated with pharmacological therapies. Presently, oral colchicine and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-choice agents for systemic treatment of acute gout. In the absence of contra-indications, NSAIDs are a convenient and well-accepted option for treatment of acute gout. In case of tophaceous or recurrent gout, the use of urate-lowering drugs is recommended. Allopurinol is currently the first choice drug despite its AE profile at the population level. Many of the currently available treatment options for gout have unwanted side effects highlighting the importance of emerging therapeutics for the treatment of the disease. <b>Benzbromarone</b> (chapter 2. 2) is an old, but very potent urate-lowering drug, and possesses some distinct, recently discovered pharmacological features, which are important for effective and safe use in treatment of gout. Although <b>benzbromarone</b> is on the market for several decades, its place in treatment of gout compared to allopurinol is unclear, because of insufficient trials of good quality. The toxicity of <b>benzbromarone</b> is generally limited, but serious benzbromarone-induced hepatic failure is reported in rare cases. The underlying mechanism has not yet been fully explained, but formation of reactive metabolites by CYP 2 C 9 resulting in mitochondrial toxicity, and CYP 2 C 9 allelic variants might play a role. Important drug-drug interactions may occur with CYP 2 C 9 -substrate drugs, but clinical data are lacking up until now. Outcome research with antihyperuricemic drugs In chapter 3, several studies concerning the efficacy and tolerability of antihyperuricemic drugs in the treatment of gout in clinical rheumatologic practice are presented. In 2003, <b>benzbromarone</b> was withdrawn from the global market. In the Netherlands, suggested alternative treatments were allopurinol (in standard dosage) or probenecid. We studied the market withdrawal of <b>benzbromarone</b> in gout patients in chapter 3. 1, and investigated the efficacy of two alternative treatment strategies: allopurinol (standard dosage) and allopurinol-probenecid combination therapy. A prospective, open study was carried out in 51 patients. Patients were given 200 - 300 mg allopurinol (stage 1); when allopurinol failed to attain the target serum urate concentration, sUr ≤ 0. 30 mmol/l (5. 0 mg/dl), probenecid 1, 000 mg/day was added (stage 2). We found that previous treatment with <b>benzbromarone</b> monotherapy (mean dosage 138 mg/day) resulted in 92 % of patients reaching target levels sUr ≤ 0. 30 mmol/l with a mean sUr decrease of 61 % compared to baseline. In stage 1, 32 patients completed treatment with allopurinol monotherapy (mean dosage 256 mg/day), which resulted in 25 % of patients attaining sUr target levels. Decrease in sUr levels was 36 %, which was significantly less compared to treatment with <b>benzbromarone.</b> In stage 2, 14 patients received allopurinol-probenecid combination therapy, which resulted in 86 % of patients attaining target sUr levels (after failure on allopurinol monotherapy), which was comparable to previous treatment with <b>benzbromarone.</b> Decrease in sUr levels was 53 %, which was a non-significant difference compared to previous treatment with <b>benzbromarone.</b> From the results, it was concluded that <b>benzbromarone</b> is a very effective sUr-lowering drug. Allopurinol in standard dosage was shown to be a less potent alternative for most selected patients to attain target sUr levels. In patients failing on allopurinol monotherapy, the addition of probenecid proves to be an effective treatment strategy for attaining sUr target levels. The results of this study stress the need for effective, evidence-based treatment strategies for lowering of serum urate in gout patients. In The Netherlands, the use of <b>benzbromarone</b> is restricted to gout patients allergic to allopurinol, or otherwise not treatable with this drug. The Dutch general practitioners’ guideline also includes patients who cannot be treated sufficiently with allopurinol. In chapter 3. 2, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of allopurinol (standard dosage) as first-choice antihyperuricemic treatment for gout, and compared the efficacy and tolerability of <b>benzbromarone</b> and probenecid as second-choice treatment. A multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial was carried out in 96 gout patients with a calculated creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min who were prescribed 300 mg allopurinol daily for 2 months (stage 1). In 82 eligible patients, 24 % attained target sUr ≤ 0. 30 mmol/l, and sUr concentrations decreased 36 % from baseline; 11 % stopped allopurinol because of adverse drug reactions. Then, 62 patients failing on allopurinol were randomised to <b>benzbromarone</b> 200 mg/day or probenecid 2, 000 mg/day (stage 2). After 2 months, 22 out of 24 patients (92 %) were treated successfully with <b>benzbromarone,</b> with a sUr decrease of 64 % on average. Treatment success with probenecid was 20 out of 31 patients (65 %), with a sUr decrease of 50 %. This study showed a poor efficacy and tolerability profile of allopurinol 300 mg/day to attain a biochemical predefined target level of sUr ≤ 0. 30 mmol/l after 2 -months treatment. Whether higher doses of allopurinol would increase treatment success, remains subject of further research (chapter 3. 4). In patients failing on allopurinol 300 mg/day, <b>benzbromarone</b> 200 mg/day is significantly more effective and better tolerated than probenecid 2, 000 mg/day. Serum urate is a well-accepted surrogate parameter for short-term evaluation of gout treatment. Furthermore, information on clinical outcomes, such as prevention of recurrent gout attacks and diminishment of tophi, is essential. A lack of long-term, good-quality, prospective data exists addressing the efficacy of serum urate (sUr) lowering treatment to prevent these clinical symptoms. We conducted an observational follow-up study (chapter 3. 3) to assess the rate of recurrent gouty arthritis in 50 patients with a history of recurrent gouty attacks, normal renal function, using antihyperuricemic treatment, and who completed a randomised controlled trial. After 10. 6 months on average, incidence of gout attacks was largely reduced compared to baseline rates: 74 % of patients were free of gouty attacks (100 % reduction), and 18 % of patients had 50 - 99 % reduction of gouty attacks. Serum urate concentrations were 0. 28 [± 0. 08] mmol/l. We found a high reduction in incidence of gout attacks, that was better than obtained in most previous studies. This might be explained by the good control of serum urate in this study. No correlation was found between reduction of gout attacks and sUr or study drug used, due to lack of power. We concluded that antihyperuricemic therapy is highly effective in reducing and preventing gout attacks in gout patients with normal renal function. In chapter 3. 4, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of allopurinol 300 - 600 mg/day versus <b>benzbromarone</b> 100 - 200 mg/day to attain a target sUr ≤ 0. 30 mmol/l. A multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial was carried out in 65 patients recently diagnosed with gout, who were randomised to allopurinol 300 mg/day or <b>benzbromarone</b> 100 mg/day (stage 1). When the target sUr was not reached, the dosage was doubled. After stage 1 treatment success was 8 out of 31 (26 %) with allopurinol 300 mg/day, and 13 out of 25 (52 %) with <b>benzbromarone</b> 100 mg/day. Overall treatment success with allopurinol 300 - 600 mg/day was 21 out of 27 (78 %), and with <b>benzbromarone</b> 100 - 200 mg/day was 18 out of 23 (78 %), a non-significant difference. In this study, dosage increase of allopurinol and <b>benzbromarone</b> did not affect tolerability. This study showed that efficacy of allopurinol (and to a lesser extent <b>benzbromarone)</b> in gout patients can be markedly increased with increasing dosage. The overall efficacy of allopurinol and <b>benzbromarone</b> was not significantly different. Therapeutic drug monitoring of allopurinol Chapter 4 concerns the therapeutic drug monitoring of allopurinol treatment. From previous studies it is known that antihyperuricemic efficacy of allopurinol is related to the serum concentration of oxipurinol, the active metabolite of allopurinol. Reference values of oxipurinol 5 - 15 mg/l (trough) are suggested, but poorly investigated. Given the poor efficacy results of allopurinol in literature and clinical practice, optimisation of allopurinol therapy is warranted. Therapeutic drug monitoring of allopurinol might be particularly useful in case of patients with renal impairment, oxipurinol-lowering drug-drug interactions, or suspected poor adherence. In chapter 4. 1, a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method with UV-detection (HPLC-UV) to obtain a method for the quantification of allopurinol and oxipurinol in human serum, was validated technically and clinically. The method showed acceptable performance on all major aspects of the validation (linearity, intra- and inter-day precision, accuracy, specificity, and lower/upper limits of quantification). For clinical validation, the serum allopurinol and oxipurinol concentrations in 66 gout patients were determined using this HPLC-UV method. Measured serum allopurinol and oxipurinol concentrations in clinical practice showed large variability with a range of < 0. 5 - 4. 3 mg/l for allopurinol and < 1. 0 - 39. 2 mg/l for oxipurinol, respectively. From these results, we concluded that the proposed method could be employed for the assay of allopurinol and oxipurinol in gout patients. Uricase for gout treatment Recently, a new class of powerful urate-lowering drugs has become available with rasburicase, recombinant uricase. Rasburicase is developed for the treatment and prevention of tumour-lysis syndrome. In chapter 5, the potential role of rasburicase in treatment of severe, treatment-resistant gout was reviewed, and explored in two cases. Future perspectives From the chapters 2. 1, 2. 2, and 3. 1, we conclude that a need for more evidence and education on treatment of gout exists, although the pathogenesis of the disease is well understood and antihyperuricemic therapies are available for decades. Indeed, (only) very recently two important guidelines have been developed: the EULAR recommendations on gout (2006) and the British guideline (2007). The - in some countries temporarily - withdrawal of <b>benzbromarone</b> made clear that this was not in the benefit of gout patients in general, because of scarcity of drugs for antihyperuricemic treatment. The benefit-risk evaluations of alternative drugs might not have been addressed properly, and better efforts might have been done for vigilance and understanding of the hepatotoxicity. Since allopurinol is the only drug currently available worldwide, {{it is very important to}} know how to use this drug safely and effectively. Chapter 3. 2, 3. 4 and 4, show that at least in patients with normal renal function, allopurinol often is inadequately dosed and that target serum urate concentrations can be reached with good tolerability by increase of allopurinol dosage and by optimising serum oxipurinol trough concentrations. In the end, good control of serum urate is associated with good control of gout symptoms (chapter 3. 3). Subject of further research is to what extent these findings can be generalised to patients with renal dysfunction, a large group in gout. This is important, because uricosuric drugs are likely to be less effective in renal dysfunction, and a need for optimisation of allopurinol dosage regimens according to renal function exists. Currently, new antihyperuricemic drugs have been developed for gout treatment: febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, and pegloticase, a pegylated form of uricase. New drugs for treatment of gout are welcomed. However, the benefit-risk profiles of these drugs are not undisputed, since febuxostat is associated with liver enzyme elevations, and pegloticase with antibody formation. These new drugs might help management of gout, but more issues require attention to bridge the gap between clinical practice and potential treatment possibilities, such as optimisation of current treatment regimens, evidence of benefit of long-term treatment of gout on clinical outcomes, and patient’s adherence. ...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A 26 -year-old {{woman was}} found to have an {{abnormally}} sensitive excretory response to a rise in plasma urate with a markedly increased ratio of uric acid to creatinine clearance (exceeding 35 %). Uric acid was studied before and after administration of pyrazinamide and <b>benzbromarone.</b> In the presence of pyrazinamide urinary uric acid decreased markedly just as in normal subjects. The uricosuric response to <b>benzbromarone</b> was reduced. No other renal tubular or metabolic abnormalities were found. It appears that the abnormality is related to an isolated defect in post-secretory reabsorption of urate. In the previous paper we give evidence for 4 com-ponents in the renal handling of uric acid in man (Levinson and Sorensen, 1979). According to that formulation 2 reabsorptive sites for urate reab-sorption exist within the nephron, 1 proximal to and 1 distal to the secretory locus. Recent reports of defects in urate reabsorption in man lend credence to the proposed scheme for renal handling of urate...|$|E
40|$|Ganoderma applanatum (G. applanatum) dispels wind to {{eliminate}} dampness and exhibited nephron- and liver-protective effects {{as noted in}} Chinese herbal classic literature; it might also affect hyperuricemia. Therefore, we examined the hypouricemia effects and mechanisms underlying G. applanatum on chemical-induced hyperuricemia in mice. Ethanol (GAE) and water (GAW) extracts were prepared by extracting G. applanatum in ethanol (GAE), followed by bathing the remains in water to yield GAW. GAE and GAW were administered orally at different doses to hyperuricemia mice, while allopurinol and <b>benzbromarone</b> served as positive controls. Both GAE and GAW showed remarkable hypouricemia activities, rendering a substantial decline in the SUA (serum uric acid) level in hyperuricemia control (P < 0. 01). Moreover, the urine uric acid (UUA) levels were enhanced by GAE and GAW. In contrast to the evident renal toxicity of allopurinol, GAE and GAW did not show a distinct renal toxicity. Almost no suppressing effect was observed on the XOD activities. However, compared to the hyperuricemia control, OAT 1 was elevated remarkably in mice drugged with GAE and GAW, while GLUT 9 was significantly decreased. Similar to <b>benzbromarone,</b> GAE decreased the URAT 1 protein levels significantly (P < 0. 01), while GAW did not display a similar effect. GAE and GAW downregulated the level of CNT 2 proteins in the gastrointestinal tract of hyperuricemia mice. Thus, G. applanatum produced outstanding hypouricemic effects, mediated by renal OAT 1, GLUT 9, and URAT 1 and gastrointestinal CNT 2 that might elevate urine uric secretions and decline in the absorption of purine in the gastrointestinal tracts. G. applanatum showed little negative influence on inner organs. By docking screening, four top-ranked compounds were identified that necessitated further investigation. Compounds: potassium oxonate, hypoxanthine, allopurinol, <b>benzbromarone...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractHyperuricemia {{has been}} shown to be {{associated}} with ventricular arrhythmias. However, the mechanisms remained unknown. We assessed whether different urate-lowering agents can attenuate arrhythmias through lowering urate itself or inhibiting xanthenes oxidize (XO) activity in infarcted rats. Male Wistar rats after ligating coronary artery were randomized to either allopurinol, or febuxostat, chemically unrelated inhibitors of XO, <b>benzbromarone</b> or vehicle for 4 weeks. Post-infarction was associated with increased oxidant stress, as measured by myocardial superoxide, isoprostane, XO activity and dihydroethidine fluorescence staining. Measurement of myocardial norepinephrine levels revealed a significant elevation in vehicle-treated infarcted rats compared with sham-operated rats. Sympathetic hyperinnervation was blunted after administering both XO inhibitors, assessed by immunofluorescent analysis, Western blotting and real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Besides, the XO inhibitors-attenuated nerve growth factor levels were reversed in the presence of peroxynitrite generator. Arrhythmic scores in the XO inhibitors-treated infarcted rats were significantly lower than that in vehicle. For similar levels of urate lowering, the uricosuric agent <b>benzbromarone</b> had no beneficial effects on oxidative stress, sympathetic hyperinnervation or arrhythmia vulnerability. Chronic use of XO inhibitors, but not uricosuric agent, down-regulated sympathetic innervation probably through a superoxide-dependent pathway and plays a role in the beneficial effect on arrhythmogenic response...|$|E
40|$|Intense {{inflammatory}} pain {{caused by}} urate crystals in joints and other tissues is amajor symptom of gout. Among therapy drugs that lower urate, <b>benzbromarone</b> (BBR), an inhibitor of urate transporters, {{is widely used}} because it is well tolerated and highly effective. We demonstrate that BBR is also an activator of voltage-gated KCNQ potassium channels. In cultured recombinant cells, BBR exhibited significant potentiation effects on KCNQ channels comparable to previously reported classical activators. In native dorsal root ganglion neurons, BBR effectively overcame the suppression of KCNQ currents, and the resultant neuronal hyperexcitability caused by inflammatory mediators, such as bradykinin (BK). <b>Benzbromarone</b> consistently attenuates BK-, formalin-, or monosodium urate–induced inflammatory pain in rat and mouse models. Notably, the analgesic effects of BBR are largely mediated through peripheral and not through central KCNQ channels, an observation supported both by pharmacokinetic studies and in vivo experiments. Moreover, multiple residues in the superficial part of the voltage sensing domain of KCNQ channels were identified critical for the potentiation activity of BBR by a molecular determinant investigation. Our data indicate that activation of peripheral KCNQ channels mediates the pain relief effects of BBR, potentially providing a new strategy {{for the development of}} more effective therapies for gout...|$|E
