5|$|Although {{they grow}} {{naturally}} on deep sandy soils, the species has proved adaptable to other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage. Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in full sun, although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts. Heavy pruning after flowering reinvigorates {{the plants and}} promotes more profuse flowering in the next season. Waratah <b>blooms</b> are highly susceptible to damage from wind, and benefit from some protection from prevailing winds. Waratah <b>blooms</b> attract birds to the garden. The species is readily propagated from fresh seed, but cultivars must be reproduced from cuttings to remain true-to-type.|$|E
5|$|Damming of the Canning caused {{dramatic}} flow reductions {{that significantly}} altered downstream aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. The {{lack of water}} flow has also resulted in a poor flushing effect below the dam wall. An excessive amount of nutrients from fertilizers and animal waste has caused algal <b>blooms</b> and eutrophication.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{look into}} {{relationship}} between some xylophyte species <b>blooming</b> time and temperature, {{this study was}} researched <b>blooming</b> time of year 2010 and 2011 and investigated the correlation between <b>blooming</b> time and temperature. The species with low <b>blooming</b> time, year day index and warmth index <b>bloomed</b> early. Warmth index was calculated in two ways, TN and TL. The result of correlation between <b>blooming</b> time and temperature showed that the species that <b>bloom</b> in spring had positive correlation between <b>blooming</b> time and temperature while purple <b>bloom</b> maple had no correlation between the two. More climate data and monitoring data are necessary for comparative analysis on correlation between <b>blooming</b> time and temperature...|$|R

5|$|In {{a species}} of marine green algae Ulvaria obscura, a major {{component}} of some algal <b>blooms,</b> dopamine is present in very high concentrations, estimated at 4.4% of dry weight. There is evidence that this dopamine functions as an anti-herbivore defense, reducing consumption by snails and isopods.|$|E
5|$|In {{some areas}} where {{narcissi}} are prevalent, their blooming in spring is celebrated in festivals.

5|$|Inflorescence : Usually {{indeterminate}} (lacking terminal flower) as a raceme (Lilium); sometimes {{reduced to}} a single terminal flower (Tulipa). When pluriflor (multiple <b>blooms),</b> the flowers are arranged in a cluster or rarely are subumbellate (Gagea) or a thyrse (spike).|$|E
50|$|While {{the most}} common is fat <b>bloom,</b> sugar <b>bloom</b> also occurs and is not {{necessarily}} distinguishable from the fat <b>bloom</b> by appearance. In freshly sugar <b>bloomed</b> samples, it is often easy to feel the surface difference; sugar <b>bloom</b> feels dry and does not melt to the touch, while fat <b>bloom</b> feels slick and melts. One can often see the difference by touching a small droplet of water to the surface. With fat <b>bloom,</b> the droplet simply beads up. With sugar <b>bloom,</b> the droplet quickly flattens and spreads, as the water dissolves the microscopic sugar particles on the surface (Seguine, 2001). Alternatively, gentle warming of the surface (with a hairdryer, for example) will cause the crystals of fat <b>bloom</b> to melt, removing the appearance of <b>bloom,</b> while leaving sugar <b>bloom</b> unchanged.|$|R

40|$|Almonds {{are one of}} {{the first}} {{commercial}} nut trees to <b>bloom</b> in early spring and thus are susceptible to temperature patterns prior to and during <b>bloom</b> which affect <b>bloom</b> timing, <b>bloom</b> length, pollination and nut set. Data used in this project include yearly dates of 90 % <b>bloom</b> from 1996 - 2006, <b>bloom</b> length in days and final crop yields in pounds per tree for Nonpareil and Mission varieties. Data were collected from the University of California Cooperative Extension reports on the 1993 - 2006 Regional Almond Variety Trials in Butte, San Joaquin and Kern Counties. Temperature pattern models in the form of Chill Hours (Chill Hour Model), Chill Units (Chill Unit Model), Chill Portions (Chill Portion Model) and Growing Degree Hours (GDH°) (Heat Model) prior to <b>bloom</b> were used to predict the date of 90 % <b>bloom</b> for each variety, site and year. Temperature model results were compared to averaged actual dates of 90 % <b>bloom</b> by site and variety used to predict <b>bloom</b> timing (Calendar Model). The relationship between <b>bloom</b> length in days and GDH° during <b>bloom</b> and the relationship between <b>bloom</b> length, GDH° during <b>bloom</b> and final crop yields were also evaluated. The average error in predicting the 90 % <b>bloom</b> date for both Nonpareil and Mission was smaller using the Calendar Model compared to the four temperature pattern models. The Chill Portion model did not have significantly higher average error in predicting the date of 90 % <b>bloom</b> than the Calendar model in Nonpareil. The Chill Unit and Chill Portion models had smaller errors in predicting 90 % <b>bloom</b> date than the Chill Hour or GDH° model in Mission. GDH° during <b>bloom</b> was positively correlated with <b>bloom</b> length. GDH° during the first four days of Nonpareil <b>bloom</b> was significantly correlated with crop yields, with each additional GDH° during <b>bloom</b> correlated with a 0. 4 lbs. /tree increase in crop yield. Further research is needed on specific temperature thresholds and their relationship to physiological changes during almond <b>bloom</b> and pollination. The practice of monitoring chilling and heat accumulation will allow growers to anticipate <b>bloom,</b> prepare to optimize bee activity during <b>bloom,</b> and plan for possible crop yield variations due to adverse weather conditions during <b>bloom</b> in almonds...|$|R

5|$|The {{alternative}} {{train of}} thought {{is that it was}} simply not advantageous to be large until the appearance of the Ediacarans: the environment favoured the small over the large. Examples of such scenarios today include plankton, whose small size allows them to reproduce rapidly to take advantage of ephemerally abundant nutrients in algal <b>blooms.</b> But for large size never to be favourable, the environment would have to be very different indeed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A <b>Bloom</b> filter is {{a compact}} data {{structure}} that supports membership queries on a set, allowing false positives. The simplicity and the excellent {{performance of a}} <b>Bloom</b> filter make it a standard data structure of great use in many network applications. In reducing the false positive rate of a <b>Bloom</b> filter, {{it is well known}} that the size of a <b>Bloom</b> filter and accordingly the number of hash indices should be increased. In this paper, we propose a new architecture reducing the false positive rate of a <b>Bloom</b> filter more efficiently. The proposed architecture uses cross-checking <b>Bloom</b> filters that are queried in case of positives of a main <b>Bloom</b> filter to cross-check the results. If every cross-checking <b>Bloom</b> filters produce negatives, the positive of the main <b>Bloom</b> filter can be determined as a false positive. The main <b>Bloom</b> filter is not necessarily large to reduce the false positive rate, since more numbers of the false positives of the main <b>Bloom</b> filter are identified by cross-checking <b>Bloom</b> filters. Simulation results show that the false positive of the proposed scheme converges to zero faster, while requiring the total memory size for <b>Bloom</b> filters smaller, than that of a single <b>Bloom</b> filter architecture...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{uncover the}} <b>Bloom</b> paradox in <b>Bloom</b> filters: sometimes, {{it is better}} to {{disregard}} the query results of <b>Bloom</b> filters, and in fact not to even query them, thus making them useless. We first analyze conditions under which the <b>Bloom</b> paradox occurs in a <b>Bloom</b> filter, and demonstrate that it depends on the a priori probability that a given element belongs to the represented set. We show that the <b>Bloom</b> paradox also applies to Counting <b>Bloom</b> Filters (CBFs), and depends on the product of the hashed counters of each element. In addition, both for <b>Bloom</b> filters and CBFs, we suggest improved architectures that deal with the <b>Bloom</b> paradox. We also provide fundamental memory lower bounds required to support element queries with limited false-positive and false-negative rates. Last, using simulations, we verify our theoretical results, and show that our improved schemes can lead to a significant improvement in the performance of <b>Bloom</b> filters and CBFs. A.

5|$|Although many natural toxins are {{secondary}} metabolites, these poisons {{also include}} peptides and proteins. An {{example of a}} toxic peptide is alpha-amanitin, which is found in relatives of the death cap mushroom. This is a potent enzyme inhibitor, in this case preventing the RNA polymerase II enzyme from transcribing DNA. The algal toxin microcystin is also a peptide and is an inhibitor of protein phosphatases. This toxin can contaminate water supplies after algal <b>blooms</b> and is a known carcinogen that can also cause acute liver hemorrhage and death at higher doses.|$|E
5|$|Coral {{reefs and}} shallow marine environments are threatened, {{not only by}} natural events and {{increased}} sea temperatures, but also by such man-made problems as pollution, sedimentation and destructive fishing practices.

30|$|The <b>Bloom</b> filter is a space-efficient data structure. Here, {{the space}} {{applies to the}} network resources, which usually {{directly}} affects the protocol efficiency. The price paid for this space efficiency is the probabilistic ambiguity inherent to the <b>Bloom</b> filter: it {{tells us that the}} element either definitely is not in the set or may be in the set. This space efficiency enables the <b>Bloom</b> filter to be utilized in many network-related applications, some representative examples are summarized in [24]. Our previous work [7] shows that the OFDM-based <b>Bloom</b> filter implementation is practically feasible in real Wi-Fi networks. It mainly deals with the ambiguity problem raised from the use of <b>Bloom</b> filter and addresses the problem.
