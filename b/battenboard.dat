40|$|Snowboarding {{as one of}} {{the fastest}} {{developing}} sports nowadays forces manufacturers to improve equipment for this sport or to introduce other innovations that would enhance pleasure of the ride. The most important and expensive part of the equipment is the snowboard itself. So far, the high-quality snowboards with the best ride properties include wood core. Every year a competition called Good Wood is organized for the best snowboard models of the season. This thesis deals with design and assessment of the new innovative composition of snowboard cores using different combinations of wood and other structural solutions. These compositions were compared with an already time-proven composition currently used by Hackboards Ltd. company. By using the stress simulation with the finite element method in SolidWorks Simulation program the stress progress and the deflection size of designed cores and the reference core were found out. Part of this thesis was also determining some of the physical and mechanical properties of native wood types according to relevant norms. Measured values were used to verify possibilities of using data of appropriate wood type from literatur efor simulation. Designed composition of the wood core formed by <b>battenboard</b> combining by poplar and beech reached very similar values as the reference composition formed by <b>battenboard</b> made of poplar and ash. The composition of combined laminated poplar and beech veneers showed a little worse properties. The composition formed by beech <b>battenboard</b> and the composition of laminated beech veneers showed worse properties in comparison with the reference composition...|$|E
