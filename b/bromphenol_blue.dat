Kinetic analysis of <b>bromphenol</b> <b>blue</b> as a substrate for squash nitrate reductase yielded apparent Km values of 60 micromolar for <b>bromphenol</b> <b>blue</b> at 10 millimolar nitrate and 500 micromolar for nitrate at 0. 2 millimolar <b>bromphenol</b> <b>blue.</b> With the same preparation of enzyme the apparent Km values were 9 micromolar for NADH at 10 millimolar nitrate and 50 micromolar nitrate at 0. 1 millimolar NADH. <b>Bromphenol</b> <b>blue</b> {{was found to be}} a noncompetitive inhibitor versus NADH with a Ki of 0. 3 millimolar. When squash NADH:nitrate reductase activity was inactivated with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate or denatured by heating at 40 °C, the <b>bromphenol</b> <b>blue</b> nitrate reductase activity was not lost.

Methods. Сhemiluminescent and histochemical technique (with <b>bromphenol</b> <b>blue</b> on ‘acidic’ and ‘basic’ proteins according to Mikel Calvo) was applied. Results. The intensity of nitro peroxides glow in chorioamnionitis and basal deciduitis increased in comparison with the samples of physiological and iron deficient anaemia gestation. At the same time in chorioamnionitis the glow intensity is higher than in basal deciduitis. Due to the results of immune histochemical technique held while analysing the samples, together with chorioamnionitis and basal deciduitis the R/B increases and in basal deciduitis the rate, is probably, higher, than in chorioamnionitis.

Adding 0. 1 % gelatin to the buffer solution used to soak {{the paper is the}} simplest way to reduce tailing, and allows the conventional <b>bromphenol</b> <b>blue</b> stain to be used to locate the protein. A protein as nearly identical to the sample as possible eliminates tailing more completely than gelatin, and can be used if the sample can be located in a background of the other protein. Making the sample fluorescent under ultraviolet light by coupling 1 -dimethylaminonaphthlalene- 5 -sulfonyl chloride to it before electrophoresis is an effective way to locate the sample in the presence of otherwise identical proteins. Oxidation of the paper with nitrogen dioxide to reduce tailing has been attempted, but the method has not been refined to a practical degree of effectiveness. Paper electrophoresis of BSA-rabbit anti-BSA complexes shows two zones attributed to the Ag 2 Ab and Ag 3 Ab 2 complexes, in qualitative agreement with moving boundary electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation by Singer and Campbell. As a supplementary argument as to the identity of the complexes, a simple statistical theory is developed to show the relative proportions of different complexes to be expected from antigens and antibodies of given valences, or to show the valences of antigens and antibodies from the quantities of the different complexes formed. Using the ultracentrifugal data of Singer and Campbell in the theoretical equations limits the valence of the antibodies to a value close to two, and the valence of the BSA antigen to a value around five...|$|E
40|$|The author {{succeeded in}} the {{extraction}} of a substance from the skeletal muscle of rabbit designated as "muscle cornin", that markedly inhibits of sea urchin eggs. This substance is dialysable and can be separated into three fractions by DEAE-cellulose column. It {{has been found that}} fraction Ⅰ has no inhibitory action on mitosis, while fraction Ⅱ and Ⅲ has marked antimitotic effect, its minimum effective dose are 10 (- 8) g/ml. The fraction Ⅱ is a nucleoprotein with hypoxanthine or xanthine as the ba se and has the maximum absorbance of ultraviolet spectrum at 249 mμ. The fraction Ⅲ is a polypeptide that has no specific maximum absorbancy of ultraviolet spectrum. The muscle cornin not only shows a typical protein wave in polarography but it also proves to be positive to ninhydrin and Liebermann reactions, <b>bromphenol</b> <b>blue</b> stain, and precipitation by trichloroacetic acid. However, it is negative to Biuret, xanthoprotein, Sakaguchi and Molish reactions. As for its sugar reaction, it is also positive to Seliwanoff and phloroglucinol reactions, but is negative to other reactions. Therefore, it has chemical properties that are partially different from those of "corneal cornin". The muscle cornin has no effect whatever on catalase activity and oxygen consumption of tissues. In addition, differing from the corneal cornin, it dose not effect the P/O ratio of rat liver mitochondria. However, just as with the corneal cornin, it dose inhibit the incorporation of (32) p into nucleic acids, especially into DNA and r-RNA of regenerating rat liver, and also it inhibits DNA synthesis. But it shows no effect on RNA synthesis. The discussion was also made on the difference in the properties of muscle cornin from those of other inhibitorsof mitosis, extracted from living tissues...|$|E
30|$|All the {{implements}} must be precooled at − 20  °C {{before the}} tests. The membrane protein (MP) was prepared with Bacterial Membrane Extraction Kit (BestBio, Shanghai, China) {{according to the}} instructions with minor modification. The working cultures of S. putrefaciens with different treatments at 180  min were centrifuged at 10, 000 g for 5  min at 0  °C, then washed with PBS buffer (0.1  M, pH 7.0) for two times. The extraction buffer A (500  μL, combined with 2  μL Protease inhibitor) {{was added to the}} sediments (20  mg), then put on ice for 2 – 3  h with shaking for 30  s with every 30  min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 12, 000 g for 5  min at 0  °C, the supernatant was collected, and then 10  μL. Extraction buffer B was added to the supernatant, then kept at 37  °C for 10  min. The mixture was centrifuged at 1000 g for 5  min at 37  °C. The under layer samples were the membrane protein (MP). MP concentration was measured with enhanced bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples may need to be diluted further to same concentration with appropriate volume of membrane protein dissolution buffer in the kit. The loaded concentration of different treatments’ MP was adjusted to 1  mg/mL. 20  μL of protein lysates was then mixed with 5  μL 5 × SDS gel-loading buffer (60  mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 14.4  mM dithiothreitol, 2 % SDS, 25 % glycerol, and 0.1 % <b>bromphenol</b> <b>blue),</b> boiled at 100  °C for 5 – 10  min before use or stored at − 20  °C until use. The loaded volume was 15  μL. Sodium-dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to measure the molecular weight changes of MP, using 12 % separating gel and a 5 % stacking gel. The running buffer was 25  mM Tris- 192  mM glycin- 0.1 % SDS, pH 8.3. The power supply was settled at 80  V during the stacking of the proteins, then at 120  V. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250 and destained with a solution of methanol and acetic acid to visualize proteins (Carraro and Catani 1983).|$|E

Background. The {{accumulation}} of toxic effluent components {{is a considerable}} hazard to water resources potential of the country. It particularly relates to waste water pollutants belonging to II?IV hazard classes such as organic dyes and diluents. Objective. The goal {{of this research was}} to investigate the main principles of <b>Bromphenol</b> <b>Blue</b> remediation from water by solvent sublation technique and to determine optimum process conditions. Methods. Bromophenol blue (BB), an anionic dye, was removed from aqueous solution by solvent sublation of a BB ? hexadecylpyridium complex (sublate) into isopentanol. The pH of the solution was determined by potentiometric method. Dye concentrations of the sample solutions were measured with the use of absorption spectroscopy. Results. The effects of the following parameters on the solvent sublation were experimentally studied: the molar ratio of hexadecylpyridium chloride (HPC) to BB, pH of the aqueous phase, the removal process duration, type of organic solvent, the size of bubbles generated in the sparger and the addition of electrolytes (like KCl) and nonhydrophobic organic compounds (like ethanol). By making central composite orthogonal design and deriving second order mathematical model with the aid of MS Excel 2003 {{it was found that the}} maximum efficiency of depicted process can be attained in a case of carrying it out under the following optimum conditions: temperature 10 ?C, surfactant/dye molar ratio 1. 94 : 1; process duration ? 15. 3 min. Conclusions. Within this research the main principles of Bromophenol Blue removal from water by solvent sublation were investigated. The second order experiment statistical model was derived with the use of central composite orthogonal design. The maximum relative standard deviation was equal to 4, 7 %. Optimum conditions were determined: According to obtained results the highest level of BB elimination reached within the experiment was equal to 97. 5 % and the residual dye content didn?t exceed the maximum allowable concentration (the M.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to clarify the {{absorption}} mechanism of a drug from the kidney surface membrane in rats. We studied the absorption characteristics of phenolsulfonphthalein (PSP) and other compounds with different molecular weights after their application to the rat kidney surface in vivo, employing a cylindrical diffusion cell (i. d. 6 mm, area 0. 28 cm 2). The time course of free PSP amounts remaining in the diffusion cell obeyed first-order kinetics at a dose of 1 mg, and its rate constant ka was calculated to be 0. 0137 min? 1. Absorption ratios of PSP in 4 h were calculated (from the amount recovered from the diffusion cell) to be 91. 4, 96. 4 and 97. 7 % at doses of 0. 5, 1 and 1. 5 mg, respectively. The area under the curve for the plasma concentration profile of free PSP was proportional to the application dose. It is thus suggested that the absorption process of PSP from the rat kidney surface does not approach saturation at a dose of 1. 5 mg. Also, no significant difference was seen in the ka values within the dose range of 0. 5 ? 1. 5 mg, which were estimated by curve-fitting the plasma concentration profiles of free PSP in a two-compartment model with first-order absorption. Furthermore, we examined the importance of molecular weight on the absorption from the kidney surface using fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextrans (FDs) with molecular weights of 4400 (FD- 4), 11, 000 (FD- 10), 40, 500 (FD- 40) or 69, 000 (FD- 70), including the organic anions <b>bromphenol</b> <b>blue</b> and bromosulfonphthalein. The absorption ratios of FDs from the rat kidney surface in 6 h decreased with an increase in the molecular weight (76. 1 % for FD- 4, 54. 4 % for FD- 10, 11. 5 % for FD- 40 and 3. 9 % for FD- 70). A linear relationship was observed between ka and the reciprocal value of z the square root of the molecular weight of these compounds. The limit of absorption from the rat kidney surface was extrapolated to be at a molecular weight of approximately 130, 000...|$|E
