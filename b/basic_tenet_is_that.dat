40|$|This article {{draws on}} data from a three-year Australian Research Council-funded study that {{examined}} {{the ways in which}} young children become numerate in the twenty-first century. We were interested in the authentic problem-solving contexts <b>that</b> we believe <b>are</b> required to create meaningful learning. This being so, our <b>basic</b> <b>tenet</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> such experiences should involve the use of information and communications technologies (ICT) where relevant, but not in tokenistic ways. This article highlights learning conditions in which young children can become numerate in contemporary times.

40|$|The {{failure of}} the {{development}} of commercially viable traditional crop insurance products and innovations in financial markers has fed a renewed interest in the search for alternatives to help producers in developing countries manage their risk exposure. Salient among these is the proposal of several index insurance schemes against weather events. Among the <b>basic</b> <b>tenets</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> the presence of index insurance allows producers to intensify their operations and reduce the risks of default and hence may induce creditors to offer loans at affordable rates. The two factors combined are touted as key to help producers in developing countries escape poverty traps. Improvements in seasonal climate forecasts create challenges for the design and effective functioning of the insurance against climate risks. However, very little is known about potential synergies or conflicting impacts of these two institutions, and the interactions between them and input management decisions by producers. We find that insurance and forecast may have synergistic or conflicting effects on input decisions. In the presence of (state contingent) actuarially fair insurance, producers may prefer the forecast information not to be available, especially if the management options available do not result in sufficient changes in profitability. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that forecast information may induce producers {{to increase the amount of}} insurance purchased.

A number of e-learning studies have used the TAM model. For example, Park (2009) attempted to predict students’ intention to use the e-learning system in a Korean university. The researcher found that the TAM constructs were effective determinants of e-learning acceptance. Park reported that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use had strong relationships with attitude, and at the same time, e-learning self-efficacy and subjective norm were strong predictors of intention to use e-learning.|$|E
40|$|The Department of Education and Skills {{operates}} a programme of inspection {{to evaluate the}} quality of education provision in schools and to contribute to school improvement. The whole-school evaluation (WSE) process is designed “to monitor and assess the quality, economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the education system provided in the state by recognised schools and centres for education” (Education Act 1998, section 7 (2) (b)). This study set out to hear directly from principals, teachers, parents and students how they had experienced a whole-school evaluation and their perceptions of its usefulness for the school. The research approach adopted was qualitative, rooted in social constructivism. A <b>basic</b> <b>tenet</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the same WSE experience could be understood from multiple perspectives, each equally valid and worth engaging with. The data set emerged from the talk of the principals, teachers, students and parents who participated in seven focus group discussions. By examining the way that these groups talk about WSE, the study identifies themes Purposiveness and Relationships that shape the participants’ perceptions of WSE. Two additional themes, specific to particular groups of respondents, were also uncovered. The Implementation theme arose from the principals’ talk and Disenfranchisement from the discussions of parents and students. The study confirmed much of what is already known about how principals and teachers perceive school evaluation. However, while recent changes to school inspection address some of the concerns expressed by the participants, this research indicates that further work needs to be done by the Inspectorate to adequately engage with parents and students particularly. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} role of urban green {{infrastructure}} (GI) in maintaining integrity of built-space. The latter is considered as a lateral ecosystem function, worth including in future assessments of integrated ecosystem services. The <b>basic</b> <b>tenet</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> integrated green–grey infrastructures (GGIs) would have three influences on built-spaces: (i) reduced wind withering from flow deviation; (ii) reduced material corrosion/degeneration from pollution removal; and (iii) act as a biophysical buffer in altering the micro-climate. A case study is presented, combining the features of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in micro-environmental modelling with the emerging science on interactions of GGIs. The coupled seasonal dynamics of the above three effects are assessed for two building materials (limestone and steel) using the following three scenarios: (i) business as usual (BAU), (ii) summer (REGEN-S), and (iii) winter (REGEN-W). Apparently, integrated ecosystem service from green–grey interaction, as scoped in this paper, has strong seasonal dependence.

40|$|Two major {{learning}} {{theories have}} dominated recent literature on optimizing knowledge acquisition: constructivism and cognitive load theory. Constructivism, {{on the one}} hand, gives preeminent value {{to the development of}} students’ self-regulated process of constructing mathematical concepts. Its <b>basic</b> <b>tenet</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> students acquire their own mathematical understanding by constructing them from the inside rather than by internalizing them from the outside. Cognitive load theory, on the other hand, suggests that the free exploration of a highly complex environment may cause a heavy working memory load and led to poorer learning. Advocates of this view further argue that constructivist strategies provide learners with information that exceeds their working memory capacity, and thus fail to efficiently guide learners’ acquisition of mathematical knowledge. The current study describes the elements of constructivism theory and their cognitive basis and show how they can be aligned with the structures that constitute human cognitive architecture. More specifically, we present several ways in which cognitive load can be managed by these elements and so facilitate mathematical learning...|$|E

40|$|In {{this special}} issue {{different}} metatheories are proposed, including evolutionary psychology (Ploeger, 2010), developmental systems theory (Antley, 2010), and advaita philosophy (Poonamallee, 2010). Evolutionary psychology is psychology that is informed by theory and research of evolutionary biology, {{with the idea that}} knowledge about the evolutionary background of psychological phenomena will contribute to the understanding of these phenomena (Cosmides, Tooby, & Barkow, 1992). Systems theory can be defined as a holistic theory about complex systems in nature. When applied to development, this theory is often called dynamic systems theory, 2 which states that developmental outcomes are the result of the spontaneous emergence of higher-order forms, which are the result of interactions among lower-level components. This process is called self-organization (Lewis, 2000). Advaita philosophy is another holistic theory that presumes non-dualism, i. e., the reality of an individual is identical to that of the world and cosmos.

40|$|At the University of Worcester we are {{continually}} striving {{to find new}} approaches to the learning and teaching of programming, {{to improve the quality}} of learning and the student experience. Over the past three years we have used the contexts of robotics, computer games, and most recently a study of Abstract Art to this end. This paper discusses our motivation for using Abstract Art as a context, details our principles and methodology, and reports on an evaluation of the student experience. Our <b>basic</b> <b>tenet</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> one can view the works of artists such as Kandinsky, Klee and Malevich as Object-Oriented (OO) constructions. Discussion of these works can therefore be used to introduce OO principles, to explore the meaning of classes, methods and attributes and finally to synthesize new works of art through Java code.

40|$|Pain is an {{unpleasant}} sensory and emotional experience urging {{the individual to}} take action to restore the integrity of the body. The transition from a common episode of acute pain to a state of intermittent or chronic pain has been a constant preoccupation of researchers and clinicians alike. In this review, we approach chronic pain from a modern learning perspective that incorporates cognitive, affective, behavioral and motivational aspects. We view pain as a biologically hard-wired signal of bodily harm that competes with other demands in the person’s environment. The <b>basic</b> <b>tenet</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> pain urges people to interrupt ongoing activity, elicits protective responses that paradoxically increase interference with daily activities, and compromises the sense of self. Here we briefly summarize existing evidence showing how pain captures attention, and how attention for pain can be controlled. We also consider pain as a strong motivator for learning, and review the recent evidence on the acquisition and generalization of pain-related fear and avoidance behavior, which are likely to interfere with daily life activities. We highlight the paradoxical effects of pain avoidance behavior, and review treatment effects of exposure in vivo. A generally neglected area of research is the detrimental consequences of repeated interference by pain with daily activities on one’s sense of “self”. We end this review with a plea for the implementation of single-case experimental designs as a means to help customize and develop novel cognitive-behavioral treatments for individuals for chronic pain aimed at reducing the suffering of this large group of individuals...|$|E

This thesis explores the dimorphic niche of ecological conditions hypothesis as the selective force behind secondary sexual dimorphism in Salix glauca, a dioecious willow shrub. The dimorphic niche hypothesis predicts trait difference between male and female plants based on sexual allocation theory. Sexual allocation's theory <b>basic</b> <b>tenet</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> each sex has unique reproductive demands and females allocate more resources overall to reproduction than males. I address this idea by first examining the main assumption of sexual allocation theory in a comparison of nutrient costs of male and female organs. Then, I examine possible divergence in traits related to a species fundamental niche: resource acquisition and tolerance of abiotic stress at two size stages, mature adults and small vegetative daughter clones. I investigated secondary sexual dimorphism in physiological traits over several years in a mosaic of mesic and xeric habitat patches at timberline in the Colorado Rocky Mountains (USA). Results support the view that gas exchange rates of female plants are maintained despite drought to support greater costs of reproduction whereas physiological plasticity allows male plants to occupy more arid environments. Finally, I examine whether sex morphs have diverged in defensive traits that are related to the realized niche in the presence of insect herbivores. I found little support for the idea that antagonist-related selection has resulted in intrasexual dimorphism, as predicted under the vigor hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|Innovation Platforms {{are fast}} {{becoming}} part of the mantra of agricultural research for development projects and programmes. Their <b>basic</b> <b>tenet</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> stakeholders depend on one another to achieve agricultural development outcomes, and hence need a space where they can learn, negotiate, and coordinate to overcome challenges and capture opportunities through a facilitated innovation process. This important publication provides a critical analysis of Innovation Platforms, their defining features, key functions, and what they can and – as importantly – cannot do. It will be invaluable reading both for those who fund development projects and programmes and would like to understand when Innovation Platforms are the approach of choice, and for those practitioners who implement and facilitate Innovation Platforms and would like to understand better their design principles and practical implementation issues. Because Innovation Platforms have been successful in addressing agricultural challenges, there is a risk that they will be promoted as a panacea for all problems in the agricultural sector. As the authors make clear, however, not all constraints will require Innovation Platforms and, if there is a simpler and cheaper alternative, that should be the first choice. It is essential to think more critically about when, how, and in what form Innovation Platforms can contribute meaningfully to Agricultural development impacts. The document was developed through a learning collaboration between CGIAR research centres and other academic and more applied research centres. Eleven of the 15 CGIAR centres participated and contributed their expertise and experiences across multiple agricultural systems, geographies, and types of complex constraint. The booklet provides information grounded in a rich practical experience of key design and implementation principles, and the financial and human resources that need to be made available, and it makes suggestions for more effective monitoring, evaluation, and learning. It also lists reference materials, answers frequently asked questions, and provides a decision support tool for research, development, and funding agencies. All in all, this publication offers a lot for those who aspire to make sensible use of Innovation Platforms in pursuing agricultural development...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{integration}} of eco-epidemiology {{in the concept}} of one-health, the success achieved by systems approach in other science areas (e. g. rodent pest control, conservation biology, etc.) and the fact that disease transmission is increasingly thought {{to be the result of}} the (socio-eco) systemic {{integration of}} links between the health of all species and that of their environment, the difficult definition of "health" as a general concept, leave open a very fertile field of research.

The life-cycle of those metazoan parasites ranges from merely sylvatic to merely domestic and offers unique opportunities to understand, in a systems approach, how anthropogenic human disturbance of ecosystems leads to transmission re-enforcement, sustained stability or to extinction in various conditions. • Wildlife ecology and ecosystem health. Here we focus on (1) wildlife human conflicts such as those triggered by small mammal population surges (potentially resulting in increased parasite transmission) as a consequence of landscape and agricultural practice alterations, (2) conservation of the black and white snub-nosed monkey in a context of global warming and increasing agricultural encroachment in high altitude forests (3) management of increasing populations of wild Asian elephants in a mosaic of forest and intensive agriculture. • Permanent workshop on adaptive monitoring, data management and modelling.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} meta-study was to establish a foundation {{for the implementation of}} Service-Learning as a pedagogy into MBA programmes in South Africa. Three major interrelated contexts underpinned the study; a) the business sector, with its deep need for appropriately skilled managers and leaders, b) the social sector within which is situated a considerable number of currently or potentially economically active community organisations, and c) higher education, particularly with reference to its legislated transformation imperative. Service-Learning as a pedagogy has never been implemented in MBA programmes in South Africa, yet the literature suggests <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> {{one of the most effective}} management development tools available to educators. The mixed methodological approach taken in this study was based on the published perceptual shift from that of analysis to one of synthesis. In this paradigm, the <b>basic</b> <b>tenet</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of investigating several constructs from different perspectives (the meta-study format) with the intention of combining them into a new coherent framework to offer the field of management education. Within this framework, data were gathered from several relevant populations, including business leaders and managers, MBA students, Service-Learning practitioners and community organisations. Through triangulation and aggregation of findings from the different sources, it <b>was</b> established <b>that</b> MBA students acting in a consultant capacity experienced real workplace learning in an authentic context, where the outputs of the work that they conducted via their academic assignments were utilised productively by the community organisations with which they worked. They were able to address at least some pressing social needs whilst meeting their academic objectives, measured using Bloom’s taxonomy of cognitive outcomes. They also reported a high level of personal growth and increased awareness of the socio-economic fabric of the country. Although the findings from this research cannot necessarily be generalised to all MBA programmes in South Africa, they do suggest that Service-Learning has an important role to play in educating South African managers, whilst addressing social, economic and educational transformation needs. This research has established <b>that</b> MBA Service-Learning <b>is</b> a worthwhile pedagogy on which to conduct further research and implementation in South African business schools...|$|R

Here, we use a multivariate nearest-neighbor framework to examine multiple North American localities spanning 3 million years to determine whether community assembly is consistent through time and four modern localities {{around the world to}} assess the effects of habitat. Additionally, we examined how trait patterns differ among families and how family-level evolutionary effects affect them. We found some broadly consistent patterns, although differences are more pronounced than similarities. Diet is more affected by evolutionary constraints than by time or place. Locomotion is most affected by habitat, and the ability to partition niches is related to habitat heterogeneity. Mass is influenced by family, but also by habitat and the mass-selective extinction events at the end-Pleistocene. These findings indicate <b>that</b> assembly patterns <b>are</b> not largely determined by within-community interactions but instead show <b>that</b> each community <b>is</b> a product of its independent variables...|$|R
