50|$|The {{original}} breed club is the Club français du Basset Artésien Normand & du Chien d'Artois, and {{the breed}} is recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale as breed number 34 in Group 6, Scenthounds. It is also recognised by the United Kennel Club (US) in the Scenthound Group. The breed {{may also be}} recognised {{by any of the}} various minor kennel clubs and internet based dog registry businesses, as well as hunting dog registries and clubs. As the breed is few in number outside France it is also promoted by rare breed <b>breeder</b> <b>organisations</b> for puppy buyers seeking an unusual pet.|$|R
5000|$|They {{vary from}} medium to medium-large in size. A longer {{name of the}} formal breed is Siberian Forest Cat, but it is usually {{referred}} to as the Siberian or the Siberian cat. [...] Another name for the formal breed is the Moscow Semi-Longhair. The cat is an ancient breed that is now believed to be ancestral to all modern long-haired cats. [...] The cat has similarities with the Norwegian Forest Cat, to which it is likely closely related. [...] It is a natural breed of Siberia and the national cat of Russia. While it began as a landrace, it is selectively bred and pedigreed today in at least seven major cat fancier and <b>breeder</b> <b>organisations.</b> The colorpoint variant of the breed is called the Neva Masquerade by some registries, including Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFé).|$|R
40|$|The Sella Italiano stallions are {{selected}} by 100 -day perfomance test, but many <b>breeders</b> <b>organisations</b> use station test of shorter length. In twelve editions, 17, 394 ten-point scores both for character and gaits, and 6291 scores for jumping {{were assigned to}} 314 candidate stallions. By means of the comparison of univariate EBVs, calculated from the complete dataset or from the reduced subsets, a dataset lasting only from 33 rd day to 78 th day of the training period was selected: it included less than 70 % of the original data. The subset was validated by 3 -trait AM BLUP: there were no evident effects on the estimates of variance component or ratio, and the aggregated selection index for the three traits showed a 99 % rank correlation with the official index. These findings demonstrate that the training period could be reduced without affecting the genetic progress in the Sella Italiano breed...|$|R
40|$|Ragdoll <b>breeder</b> <b>organisations</b> often forewarn Ragdoll cat owners that renal {{problems}} may develop {{as a result}} of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), chronic interstitial nephritis, familial renal dysplasia or nephrocalcinosis. Healthy Ragdoll and non-Ragdoll cats were prospectively evaluated by measuring serum creatinine and urea concentrations, routine urinalysis and abdominal ultrasonography. All Ragdoll cats also underwent genetic PKD testing. One hundred and thirty-three Ragdoll and 62 control cats were included. Ragdoll cats had significantly lower serum urea concentrations and higher urinary specific gravity. However, median creatinine concentration, median urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio, and the proportion of cats with serum creatinine or urea concentration exceeding the reference interval did not differ. One or more renal ultrasonographical changes were detected in 66 / 133 (49. 6 %) Ragdoll and in 25 / 62 (40 %) control cats. Ragdoll cats showed significantly more frequent segmental cortical lesions (7. 5 % versus 0 %), abnormal renal capsule (19. 5 % versus 8 %) and echogenic urine (51. 9 % versus 25. 8 %). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was ultrasonographically suspected in 7 / 133 (5. 3 %) Ragdoll and in none of the control cats, which approached significance. Laboratory parameters confirmed kidney dysfunction only in 1 / 7 of these Ragdoll cats. All Ragdoll cats were PKD negative. In conclusion, first, breed-specific serum creatinine reference intervals are not likely required for Ragdoll cats. Second, renal ultrasonographical abnormalities are common, both in Ragdoll and non-Ragdoll cats. Third, healthy young Ragdoll cats are uncommonly affected by PKD and CKD, but an increased susceptibility of Ragdoll cats to develop CKD cannot be excluded. Finally, Ragdoll cats are predisposed to segmental cortical lesions, which may indicate renal infarction or cortical scarring...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{quantitative}} and qualitative traits of semen were studied in seven rams of different breeds (Prolific Merino, Cokanski Tsigai, Barbados Blackbelly, Bábolna Tetra, Awassi, Ile de France and Suffolk), bred in Hungary. The semen parameters (density, volume, pH, mass motility, % motility, thawing and heat resistance), freezability of semen and the factors influencing these parameters were evaluated with respect to breed and season. The fresh and post-thawing quality of semen varied greatly with the breed and the season. The postthawing motility of semen cells was outstandingly high for Awassi rams in three seasons. During the test period, the smallest scrotal circumference was measured for Barbados Blackbelly, except for the summer when it increased by 12. 5 cm. The reintroduction of artificial insemination {{could lead to a}} significant advancement of the sheep sector in Hungary. To promote this, we have provided useful and new information for <b>breeders</b> and <b>organisations...</b>|$|R
500|$|The Norwegian Forest cat {{is adapted}} to survive Norway's cold weather. Its {{ancestors}} may include black and white shorthair cats brought to Norway from Great Britain some time after 1000 AD by the Vikings, and longhaired cats brought to Norway by Crusaders. These cats could have reproduced with farm and feral stock and may have eventually evolved into the modern-day Norwegian Forest breed. The Siberian and the Turkish Angora, longhaired cats from Russia and Turkey, respectively, are also possible ancestors of the breed. Norse legends refer to the skogkatt as a [...] "mountain-dwelling fairy cat with an ability to climb sheer rock faces that other cats could not manage." [...] Since the Norwegian Forest cat is a very adept climber, author Claire Bessant believes that the skogkatt folktale could be about the ancestor of the modern Norwegian Forest breed. [...] The name Norse skogkatt is used by some <b>breeder</b> and fancier <b>organisations</b> for the modern breed.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of lactation stage, parity, lambing season, and herd on fat and protein content in Pag sheep. Data included 21. 033 test-day records of 2. 332 ewes lambed between November 2003 and May 2008. Research was conducted in 32 herds (23 of them were reared in the south-western and 9 in the northeastern part of the Pag Island). Daily milk yield and milk components were recorded using AT 4 method in the routine milk recording scheme. The stage of lactation, described by Ali and Schaeffer lactation curve nested within rearing area, had significant effect (P< 0. 0001) on fat and protein content. The lowest fat and protein content was between the 20 th (north-eastern part) and 30 th day of lactation (southwestern part) and increased towards the end of lactation. Parity also affected differences (P< 0. 0001) in milk components. The lowest estimated value was observed in the first and the highest in the eighth parity for both traits. Differences in fat and protein content as a result of lambing season were also observed (P< 0. 0001). Pag ewes lambed in December 2003 had the highest milk fat content, while the lowest value was observed in milk from ewes lambed in February 2004. Winter lambing ewes (December 2004) had the highest, while ewes lambed in December 2005 had the lowest estimated protein content. Flock nested within rearing area affected fat and protein content ignificantly (P< 0. 0001). Ewes reared in herds from north-eastern part of Pag Island had wider range of fat and protein content compared to ewes reared in herds from south-western part of Pag Island. The knowledge about effects that have influence on milk components in Pag sheep provides useful information to <b>breeders</b> in production <b>organisation</b> on their farms...|$|R
