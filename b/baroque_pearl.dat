50|$|<b>Baroque</b> <b>pearls</b> are pearls with an {{irregular}} non-spherical shape. Shapes {{can range from}} minor aberrations to distinctly ovoid, curved, pinch, or lumpy shapes. Most cultured freshwater <b>pearls</b> are <b>baroque</b> because freshwater <b>pearls</b> are mantle-tissue nucleated instead of bead nucleated. Cultured saltwater pearls can also be baroque, but {{tend to be more}} teardrop-shaped due to the use of a spherical nucleation bead.|$|R
50|$|Drop and {{pear shaped}} pearls are {{sometimes}} referred to as teardrop pearls and are most often seen in earrings, pendants, or as a center pearl in a necklace. <b>Baroque</b> <b>pearls</b> have a different appeal; they are often highly irregular with unique and interesting shapes. They are also commonly seen in necklaces. Circled pearls are characterized by concentric ridges, or rings, around the body of the pearl.|$|R
5000|$|Keshi pearls, {{although}} they often occur by chance, {{are not considered}} natural. They are a byproduct of the culturing process, and hence do not happen without human intervention. They are quite small, typically only a few millimeters. Keshi pearls are produced by {{many different types of}} marine mollusks and freshwater mussels in China. Keshi pearls are actually a mistake in the cultured pearl seeding process. In seeding the cultured pearl, a piece of mantle muscle from a sacrificed oyster is placed with a bead of mother of pearl within the oyster. If the piece of mantle should slip off the bead, a pearl forms of baroque shape about the mantle piece which is entirely nacre. Therefore, a Keshi pearl could be considered superior to cultured pearls with a mother of pearl bead center. In the cultured pearl industry, the resources used to create a mistaken all nacre <b>baroque</b> <b>pearl</b> is a drain on the production of round cultured pearls. Therefore, they are trying to improve culturing technique so that keshi pearls do not occur. All nacre pearls may one day be limited to natural found pearls. Today many [...] "keshi" [...] pearls are actually intentional, with post-harvest shells returned to the water to regenerate a pearl in the existing pearl sac.|$|E

50|$|A pearl is a {{hard object}} {{produced}} within the soft tissue (specifically the mantle) of a living shelled mollusk or another animal, such as a conulariid. Just like the shell of a mollusk, a pearl is composed of calcium carbonate (mainly aragonite or a mixture of aragonite and calcite) in minute crystalline form, which has been deposited in concentric layers. The ideal pearl is perfectly round and smooth, but many other shapes, known as <b>baroque</b> <b>pearls,</b> can occur. The finest quality natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and objects of beauty for many centuries. Because of this, pearl has become a metaphor for something rare, fine, admirable and valuable.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{observed}} {{the relation between}} gonad maturity and pearl-sac formation of the pearl-oysters (Pinctada martensii Dunker) at a pearl-farm in Sasebo Bay, Nagasaki Prefecture from August (average water temperature 27. 7 ℃) to September (average water temperature 26. 5 ℃) 1955. The results obtained are as follows: 1. When the operation is done on the gonad tissues in its mature stage or spawning stage, many of the mature gamates make themselves free from the follicles around the wound cavity, but the immature gamates (gonium. gonocyte) that stay on the follicular epidermis do not make themselves free so easily. 2. Much blood, gamates or organic substances which made themselves free into the wound cavity {{at the time of}} the operation, hinder the increase of the pearl-sac cells and pearl-sac formation. At the same time those substances in the pearl-sac gradually get rotten and become the cause of forming baroque pearls or stained pearls. 3. After the operation on the gonad tissues, the follicular cells around the wounded cavity increase actively, so the cut surface is completely cured two days after. The outer epidermis of the mantle piece, also, increase rapidly along the follicular epidermal cells, forming the pearl-sac. 4. The outer epidermis of the mantle piece forms the pearl-sac, being much increased after the operation. The epidermal cells of the pearl-sac become quite flat 22 days after the operation and change into thin layers with small shallow cup-shaped glandular cells. The nacre secretion is observed on this thin layers. 5. With the small pearl-sac (seed pearl), the formation is completed about 2 days after the operation; with the pearl-sac whose nucleus is about 2 - 5 mm in diameter, it takes about 4 or 5 days for the complete formation; and with much larger pearl-sac, it take﻿ about six or seven days. Yet great difference does not be observed in the rate of the pearl-sac formation studied from the point of gonad maturity. 6. As for the secretion from the pearl-sac in each stage, periostracal substance secretion of the outer epidermis of the mantle piece is seen sometime on the third day after the operation. After some seventh day, the periostracal substance secretion of the epidermis of the pearl-sac is observed. Those pearls in their follicular stage prove to have the secretion of the prismatic substance. After the operation of those in each stage, it takes about 20 days for some pearls to show the nacre secretion, about 22 days for 50 % of them and more than 30 days for the rest. 7. Every part of the pearl-sac is different in quantity of secretion. Those parts that were once the outer epidermis of the mantle piece and those epidermal cells that have excellent connective tissues around the pearl-sac have taller epidermal cells and much more secretion. On the contrary, those parts that have close attachment of the gonad cells around the pearl-sac and those epidermal cells that have poor connective tissues are likely to have lower epidermal cells and less secretion. Such difference in the quantity of secretion in every part of the pearl-sac can be the cause of <b>baroque</b> <b>pearl</b> formation. 8. The inner epidermis of the mantle piece begins to degenerate after the operation, and it takes about three days to be fused to the gonad tissues around. On the fourth day is seen the complete fusion. But those parts near the retractor muscle show incomplete fusion. After the 14 th day, most inner epidermis of the mantle piece disappears and no trace of it can be observed. The cut surface of the mantle piece fuses mostly on the second day, and on the 3 rd day is seen its complete fusion to the gonad tissues. 9. Most muscle tissues of the mantle piece scatter and disappear 14 days after the operation, but in some parts they remain even 22 days after the operation. All of them disappear completely about 30 days after, and only the connective tissues remain as a part of the tissues around the pearl-sac. 10. There is a tendency that the spawning of the gonad is done earlier at the follicules near the outer portion than at the follicules near the inner part of the body...|$|E

40|$|International audiencen French Polynesia, the {{aquaculture}} of Pinctada margaritifera {{is carried}} out in numerous grow-out sites, located over three archipelagos (Gambier, Society and Tuamotu). To evaluate the impact of macro-geographical effects of these growing sites on pearl quality traits, five hatcheries produced families were used as homogeneous donor oysters in an experimental graft. The molluscs were then reared in two commercial locations: Tahaa Island (Society) and Rangiroa atoll (Tuamotu). At harvest, eight pearl quality traits were recorded and compared: surface defects, lustre, grade, circles, shape categories, darkness level, body and secondary colour and visual colour categories. Overall inter-site comparison revealed that: (1) all traits were affected by grow-out location except for lustre and round shape, and (2) a higher mean rate of valuable pearls was produced in Rangiroa. Indeed, for pearl grade, Rangiroa showed twice as many A-B and less reject samples than Tahaa. This {{was related to the}} number of surface defects (grade component) : in Rangiroa, twice as many pearls had no defects and less pearls had up to 10 defects. Concerning pearl shape, more circled and <b>baroque</b> <b>pearls</b> were found in Tahaa (+ 10 %). For colour variation, 10 % more pearls have an attractive green overtone in Rangiroa than in Tahaa, where more grey body colour were harvested.

40|$|For {{two months}} from August to September, 1955, {{on the coast}} of Sakibe, Sasebo Bay, Nagasaki Prefecture, we {{observed}} histologically the effect on the pearl-sac formation after the operation had been done to the inner and outer epidermis of the mantle piece of the pearl-oyster (Pinctada martensii), giving an artificial injury of applying 5 % solution of AgNO 3 for 1, 3, 5 and 10 minutes. The results obtained are as follows:- 1. When we observe the relation between the time and stage required for the injury done with 5 % AgNO₃, we find that it takes the inner and outer epidermal cells of the piece about 10 minutes to have almost perfect injury, but as the surface of the mantle piece is uneven it is quite difficult to give perfectly even injury to the outer surface. 2. After we have done an operation giving an injury to the outer epidermal cells of the mantle piece, we find that these cells will grow to be high columnar pearl-sac outer ones recovering from the injury and increasing themselves greatly in number. The outer epidermal cells {{on the surface of the}} mantle piece will be the highest from the period of the secretion of periostracal substance to the early period of prismatic substance. After these periods are over, they will gradually decrease in height and become low and flat, but if they are severely injured, you can see, within 2 or 4 days after this, the formation of the outer epidermal cells of the mantle piece even on the surface of the muscle bundle of the mantle piece. 3. The more we give injury to the inner and outer cells of the mantle piece, especially when severer injury is given to the latter, the slower the pearl-sac formation will become and the weaker the secrtory activity, especially nacreous secretion. The crystal of secretion has the tendency to form uneven granular layer: the kind or the quantity of the secretion will also have the tendency to be irregular in the different parts of the same one pearl sac. To sum up, it can be said that the above mentioned tendencies will likely be the cause of forming <b>baroque</b> <b>pearls...</b>|$|R
40|$|Production of larger, rounder, {{high-quality}} {{cultured pearls}} with fewer circles {{is one of}} the main challenges of Pinctada margaritifera aquaculture faced by every pearl farm in French Polynesia. Although bigger pearl sizes can be achieved through surgreffe operations (implantation of a second nucleus following pearl harvest), control of the development of pearl circles and shapes still remains unclear, as illustrated by grafter’s empirical rules, where often the surgreffe process is only performed after production of uncircled and round pearl shapes. The present study was designed with a real pearl by pearl traceability to reveal for the first time the development of circles and shapes from graft and surgreffe, in relation to the size of the pearl sac. This was indirectly assessed by measuring the differences in diameter (DD) and weight (DW) between standardized surgreffe nuclei and the pearl that had been harvested following the initial graft. An experimental graft and surgreffe experiment was designed using the same criteria: grafter, location, nuclei brand and size for graft and surgreffe, and donor oysters from 10 bi-parental families produced in a hatchery system. We studied the differences between pearls harvested following graft and surgreffe on the same recipient oysters (N = 295 for both graft and surgreffe) in relation to three classes of DD and DW in which the surgreffe nuclei, were: 1) bigger / heavier, 2) equivalent to or 3) smaller/lighter than the harvested pearl. Results revealed that to increase the rate of uncircled pearls following surgreffe, insertion of a nucleus larger than the harvested pearl may be advisable. Indeed, the formation of uncircled pearls following surgreffe was enhanced by inserting bigger / heavier second nucleus, both in animals that had produced a uncircled pearl after the initial graft and in those that had produced a circled pearl. For pearl shape, significantly more round shape pearls were produced after surgreffe, following initial oval and baroque samples from graft, by inserting smaller/lighter and bigger/heavier second nucleus, respectively. Inserting a larger second nucleus will significantly increase the rate of both uncircled and round-shaped pearls. This finding has important implications for surgreffe practices, where recipient oysters with undesirable circle or <b>baroque</b> <b>pearls</b> could now be used in this second stage of production...|$|R

The results obtained from the experiments are as follows. 1) The black pigment of the organic matter which has been packed between the component layer and {{the nucleus of the}} pearl was considered to be melanin-like pigment from its property on solvent and on oxidizer and from the absorption spectrum of it (Fig. 3). 2) The tyrosinase of the crude enzyme solution extracted from the internal organs was inactive, and it was activated by the addition of Cu [...] (Fig. 1). Fe [...] and Ni [...] could be substituted for Cu [...] to some degree (Table 1). The black pigment formation was largest in pH 7. 5 to 8. 0 (Fig. 2). 3) When the whole suspension of internal organs was stored in the temperature range from 0 °to 5 ℃, its tyrosinase became inactive in 4 days and was again activated after 5 to 8 days.
