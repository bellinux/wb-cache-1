25|$|A Nielsen {{study shows}} {{consumers}} want {{a more personal}} connection {{in the way they}} gather information. Our brains are far more engaged by storytelling than by cold, hard facts. When reading straight data, only the language parts of our brains work to decode the meaning. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> read a story, not only do the language parts of our brains light up, but any other part of the brain that we would use if we were actually experiencing what we're reading about becomes activated as well. This means it's far easier for us to remember stories than hard facts.|$|E
25|$|It will {{hardly be}} disputed, I suppose, that the {{department}} of literature in which the Eastern writers stand highest is poetry. And I certainly never met with any orientalist who ventured to maintain that the Arabic and Sanscrit poetry could be compared to that of the great European nations. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> pass from works of imagination to works in which facts are recorded and general principles investigated, the superiority of the Europeans becomes absolutely immeasurable. It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in the Sanscrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgments used at preparatory schools in England. In every branch of physical or moral philosophy, the relative position of the two nations is nearly the same.|$|E
25|$|The {{more closely}} we look into history, the more clearly shall we {{perceive}} {{that the system}} of chivalry is an invention almost entirely poetical. It is impossible to distinguish the countries {{in which it is}} said to have prevailed. It is always represented as distant from us both in time and place, and whilst the contemporary historians give us a clear, detailed, and complete account of the vices of the court and the great, of the ferocity or corruption of the nobles, and of the servility of the people, we are astonished to find the poets, after a long lapse of time, adorning the very same ages with the most splendid fictions of grace, virtue, and loyalty. The Romance writers of the twelfth century placed the age of chivalry in the time of Charlemagne. The period when these writers existed, is the time pointed out by Francis I. At the present day , we imagine we can still see chivalry flourishing in the persons of Du Guesclin and Bayard, under Charles V and Francis I. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> come to examine either the one period or the other, although we find in each some heroic spirits, we are forced to confess {{that it is necessary to}} antedate the age of chivalry, at least three or four centuries before any period of authentic history.|$|E

The band's frontman J Mascis explained, [...] "We recorded it for a compilation album, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> finished it we {{liked it so much}} we didn't want to give it to them." [...] Smith said, [...] "J Mascis sent me a cassette, and it was so passionate. It was fantastic.

500|$|... "Hunting Trip" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel J. Goor and {{directed}} by series co-creator Greg Daniels. The episode introduced a romantic subplot between the characters Andy and April which continued throughout the second season and into the third. Series co-creator Michael Schur said the pairing was not previously planned, but grew when it was discovered during the filming of [...] "Hunting Trip" [...] that actors Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt had strong comedic chemistry together. However, Schur also said the idea to pair them together in [...] "Hunting Trip" [...] stemmed in part from a line Plaza improvised in the first season finale [...] "Rock Show", when Andy explained his style of music and April replied that she completely understood him. Schur said, [...] "At the time, it was this little nothing, throwaway thing, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> watched it, we thought {{there might be something}} there." ...|$|E
500|$|The role of Frank, the suicidal Proust scholar, was {{originally}} written for Bill Murray, {{and there was}} also studio pressure for Robin Williams. The directing duo chose Steve Carell for the role a few months before filming began, and in an interview revealed: [...] "When we met with Steve Carell, we didn't know he could do this based upon what he had done. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> met with him and talked to him about the character, the tone of the movie and the way we were approaching it, he was right on the same page with us". Although known to Comedy Central viewers for many years as a correspondent on the highly rated satirical news program The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, at the time Carell was cast for Little Miss Sunshine, he was relatively unknown in Hollywood. Producers of the film were worried that he was not a big enough star and did not have much acting experience.|$|E

A version {{featuring}} an extended introduction {{was performed on the}} closing nights of the third leg of The Joshua Tree tour, again in Tempe, Arizona, on December 19 & 20, 1987, and footage from the performance was featured in the Rattle and Hum film. [...] The song has since been played at nearly every full-length concert that U2 has headlined, totaling upwards of 900 performances [...] The song is widely {{regarded as one of the}} group's most popular live songs. Bono said of it, [...] "We can be in the middle of the worst gig in our lives, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> go into that song, everything changes.

500|$|The Ludys {{argue that}} one's love {{life should be}} both guided by and {{subordinate}} to one's relationship with God. They suggest that, [...] "if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the person you will one day marry... is alive and wandering the earth" [...] and that this knowledge should encourage people to act {{in such a way}} that their future spouses would be pleased. The Ludys contest the definition of [...] "true love" [...] as an emotion; instead, they define [...] "true love" [...] as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that [...] "there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied... <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others... our deepest needs are met as well!" ...|$|E
500|$|To prevent Channel Orange from leaking {{onto the}} Internet, Ocean planned {{to release it}} {{digitally}} one week earlier than its publicly announced date. He was inspired by Jay-Z and Kanye West, who prevented their 2011 album Watch the Throne from leaking by announcing several misleading release dates. On June 8, Ocean announced a July 17 release date and released a trailer for the album directed by Nabil Elderkin. On July 9, he made his television debut on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and performed [...] "Bad Religion" [...] with backing from the show's house band The Roots and a strings section. The show announced the album's actual release date and vendor, Universal Music Group, who made it available on July 10 as a digital download on iTunes. Ocean said at the time, [...] "I haven't even held one in my hands ... The [...] are done, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> sent them in, they were locked down at the manufacturer. They haven't left.

500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Wild Night", {{a hybrid of}} R, soul and country music influences, which {{utilizes}} a moderate 4/4 time signature and features the lead guitar playing of Ronnie Montrose. The song's intro was created, according to Montrose, [...] when [...] "One afternoon I was messing around with {{what is now the}} intro on the record, [...] stopped me and ... said ' ... that thing you just played ... that's the intro, don't forget it'". This guitar driven intro in Clinton Heylin's opinion made it one of Morrison's most memorable singles. [...] "Wild Night", which has been described by biographer Ken Brooks as [...] "a great start to the album", was first recorded after the Astral Weeks sessions in Autumn 1968 and was re-recorded numerous times before its eventual release on Tupelo Honey. Morrison recalled during an interview that the song was originally [...] "a much slower number, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> got to fooling around with it in the studio, we ended up doing it in a faster tempo." ...|$|E
500|$|Rising {{standards}} of achievement at Dartington enabled Imogen to organise performances of more demanding works, such as Bach's Mass in B minor in July 1950 to honour the 200th anniversary of Bach's death. Three years in preparation, this endeavour brought a tribute {{from one of}} the audience: [...] "I don't know, and can't imagine what the music of heaven is like. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> all get there, please God, if any conducting is still necessary I hope your services will be required and that I will be in the chorus". By the middle of 1950 Imogen's professional focus was changing. She had attended the first two Aldeburgh Festivals in 1948 and [...] 1949, and in 1950 accepted a commission [...] to provide a choral work for performance at the 1951 festival. Sensing {{that it was time to}} leave Dartington, she gave a year's notice, part of which was spent on sabbatical, studying Indian music at Rabindranath Tagore's university in West Bengal. A fruit of this visit was her Ten Indian Folk Tunes for recorder. On 21 July 1951 her one-act opera, Benedick and Beatrice, was performed at Dartington, to mark her departure.|$|E
500|$|Beginning on 1 June, {{the first}} track to be {{recorded}} was [...] "Us and Them", followed six days later by [...] "Money". [...] Waters had created effects loops from recordings of various money-related objects, including coins thrown into a food-mixing bowl taken from his wife's pottery studio, and these were later re-recorded {{to take advantage of}} the band's decision to record a quadraphonic mix of the album (Parsons has since expressed dissatisfaction with the result of this mix, attributed to a lack of time and the paucity of available multi-track tape recorders). [...] "Time" [...] and [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky" [...] were the next pieces {{to be recorded}}, followed by a two-month break, during which the band spent time with their families and prepared for an upcoming tour of the US. [...] The recording sessions suffered regular interruptions; Waters, a supporter of Arsenal F.C., would often break to see his team compete, and the band would occasionally stop work to watch Monty Python's Flying Circus on the television, leaving Parsons to work on material recorded up to that point. [...] Gilmour has, however, disputed this claim; in an interview in 2003 he said: [...] "We would sometimes watch them <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were on a roll, we would get on." ...|$|E

500|$|.....a {{great number}} of citizens, {{in various parts of}} the United States, are preparing, and many have {{actually}} emigrated to this Territory, to get free from a Government which does tolerate slavery ...

The toleration of slavery is either right or wrong; and if Congress should think, with us, that it is wrong, that it is inconsistent with the principles upon which our future constitution is to be formed, your memorialists will rest satisfied that, at least, this subject will not be by them taken up until the constitutional number of the citizens of this Territory shall assume that right.|$|E
500|$|The Indians {{played against}} the New York Giants in the 1954 World Series, {{but unlike the}} 1948 Series, Feller did not make an appearance. The Indians were swept in four games by the Giants. Indians manager Al López said of not {{starting}} Feller, [...] "I know Feller wanted to start one of the games in the 1954 World Series (when the Indians were swept by the New York Giants), though we never really talked about it ... If we had won {{the first or second}} game in New York, I was going to start Feller in Cleveland in the fourth game. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> didn't (win either game in New York), why in the hell was I going to pitch Feller? He was the fifth starter on the club at that time, and wasn't the Feller he'd been (earlier in his career)." [...] In 1955, Feller spent part of the season as a starter, then was moved to the bullpen later in the season. He won and lost four games each in 25 appearances. During the offseason, he became chairman of the Ohio March of Dimes and served as player representative for the American League. He worked with National League representative Robin Roberts throughout the offseason, discussing the possibility of player arbitration and pensions with baseball owners; he then became president of the Baseball Players' Association.|$|E
500|$|During a {{scene when}} Andy {{describes}} {{his style of}} music, April responds that she completely understands him, although the other characters seemingly do not. That line was improvised by Aubrey Plaza, and later helped inspire the writing staff to place the April and Andy characters into a romantic relationship. Schur said of this, [...] "At the time, it was this little nothing, throwaway thing, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> watched it, we thought {{there might be something}} there." [...] The scene with Mark making a pass at Ann at the rock show, and Ann's angry reaction to the attempt, were a last-minute addition to the episode. Although Mark and Ann would develop a romantic relationship in the second season, the Parks and Recreation writers had not decided what would happen between the developing romantic plotlines between Leslie and Mark, or Leslie and Ann, at time [...] "Rock Show" [...] aired. In the original pilot script, Mark helped Leslie solely because he was attracted to Ann and felt that green-lighting Leslie's project would give him an excuse {{to spend more time with}} her; the shooting version was retooled to make Leslie less pathetic and Mark less unlikable, by having him won over by Leslie's determination to fight against the odds. Immediately after [...] "Rock Show" [...] was originally broadcast, NBC set up an official website for [...] "Scarecrow Boat", Andy's band featured in the episode. The site, at scarecrowboat.com, included ringtones, band posters, songs for download and photos.|$|E
