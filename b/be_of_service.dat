5|$|Vaughan Williams {{was born}} to a well-to-do family with strong moral views and a {{progressive}} social outlook. Throughout his life he sought to <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> to his fellow citizens, and believed in making music as available as possible to everybody. He wrote many works for amateur and student performance. He was musically a late developer, not finding his true voice until his late thirties; his studies in 1907–08 with the French composer Maurice Ravel helped him clarify the textures of his music.|$|E
5|$|Bessell, {{anxious to}} <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> to his party's highest-profile figure, flew to Dublin in April 1965. He found that Josiffe was being advised by a {{sympathetic}} Jesuit priest, Father Sweetman, {{who believed that}} at least some of Josiffe's allegations might be true; otherwise, he asked Bessell, why had he flown all the way from London to deal with them? Bessell warned Josiffe of the consequences of attempting to blackmail a public figure, but in a more conciliatory vein promised to help recover the missing luggage and insurance card. He also hinted at the possibility of an equestrian job in America. Bessell's intervention appeared to contain the problem, particularly as Josiffe's suitcase was recovered shortly afterwards—although, according to Josiffe, letters implicating Thorpe had been removed. For most of the following two years Josiffe remained largely quiescent in Ireland, attempting to establish himself in various careers; part of this time was spent in a monastery. It was during this period that he formally adopted the name of Scott.|$|E

25|$|The {{publication}} of the book was the means of putting Booth at once into communication with the author and his wife, who begged her to visit them in Switzerland; and it subsequently brought about a correspondence with most of those European sympathizers with the North who handled a pen, such as Augustin Cochin, Edouard Laboulaye, Henri Martin, Edmond de Pressense, Conte du Montalembert, Monseigneur Dupanloup, and others, — men of all shades of religious and political belief at home, but united in the hatred of slavery, and in sympathy for the cause in whose success its extinction was involved. These gentlemen vied {{with each other in}} sending her advance-sheets of their boots, and numerous articles, letters, and pamphlets to meet the question of the day, which she swiftly translated, publishing them without money and without price, in the daily journals, and through the avenues afforded by the Union League Club. In return, she kept these noble Frenchmen accurately informed of the progress of events, and sent them such publications as could <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E

[...] This journal contains Strang's musings on a variety of topics, including his desire to [...] "rival Caesar or Napoleon" [...] and his regret that by age nineteen, he had not yet become a general or member of the state legislature, which he saw as being essential by that point in his life to his quest to be someone of importance. [...] However, Strang's diary equally reveals a heartfelt desire to <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> to his fellow man, together with agonized frustration at not knowing how he might do so as a penniless, unknown youth from upstate New York.|$|E

500|$|It is also {{possible}} the Sydney punchbowls may have had other purposes – to promote the fledgling settlement and to encourage new settlers. In 1820, artist John William Lewin's patron, merchant Alexander Riley, {{looking for ways to}} promote the New South Wales colony, stated: [...] "It has long been a subject of our consideration in this Country that a Panorama exhibited in London of the Town of Sydney and surrounding scenery would create much public interest and ultimately <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> to the Colony". This purpose is clearly set forth even in the title of William Charles Wentworth's tome on New South Wales, which contained the engraving of Lewin's Sydney Cove painting. The full title ends [...] "...With a Particular Enumeration of the Advantages Which These Colonies Offer for Emigration, and Their Superiority in Many Respects Over Those Possessed by the United States of America". The punchbowls were also an opportunity to present the art of topographical panoramas {{in the form of a}} high status object and to portray the new colony in a more glamorous way than that of simply a remote convict colony as perceived at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{only are}} gossip and slander {{held to be}} covered by the commandment against false witness, Catholic {{teaching}} also holds that “every word or attitude is forbidden which by flattery, adulation, or complaisance encourages and confirms another in malicious acts and perverse conduct. Adulation is a grave fault if it makes one an accomplice in another's vices or grave sins. Neither the desire to <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> nor friendship justifies duplicitous speech.” [...] Furthermore, boasting and bragging are viewed as offenses against truth.

Senators Schumer (D-NY), Feinstein (D-CA), and Specter (R-PA) replied that the resignation was entirely attributable to the excessive politicization of the Attorney General's office by Gonzales, whose credibility with Congress, they asserted, was nonexistent.|$|E

The two forces {{met on the}} banks of the Spey at Enzie, where the road from Aberdeen to Inverness forded the waters of the River Spey, the eastern edge of the province of Moray. There is no surviving account of the ensuing confrontation, but it appears that it replayed Moray's earlier 'dance' with the Countess of Ross. An extremely ambiguous account of events was subsequently sent from Inverness to King Edward by Bishop Cheyne on 25 August, relates that after some discussion, Moray and his rebel army withdrew into very great stronghold of bog and wood [...] no horseman could <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> This was a highly uninventive explanation when one considers the Comyn family pacified the province of Moray in the early 13th century. It appears more likely that neither side wished to fight men that they did not consider their enemies and they simply went their separate ways.
