40|$|The {{results of}} the already {{published}} three reports and this paper are summarized as follows (ref. the summarized table) : 1. The 48 groups of lymph nodes were distinguished by their positions in the cat. Out of them, 9 groups : Lnn. subinguinales profundi, Lnn. epigastrici craniales, Ln. femoralis lateralis, Ln. prefemoralis, Lnn. intestinales, Lnn. sacrales laterales, Ln. mediastinalis ventralis, Lnn. mediastinales dorsales and Ln. diaphragmaticus, as lymph nodes in the cat, are herein described {{for the first time}} on the basis of the writers' observations. Furthermore, in 13 groups (^* mark) some revisions have become necessary in detailed descriptions. 2. Each group of lymph nodes was placed in either the constant (100 %), nearly constant (less than 100 %, over 80 %) or inconstant (less than 80 %) group determined by that occurrence ratio. The inconstant group, it showed a specific feature in that it consists of small nodes, generally less than 6 mm in the longest diameter. 3. In regard to the numbers of lymph nodes, some remarkable individual variations were noted in the abdominal cavity only, but not in other areas. No definite variations were found by sexes or between the right and left sides of the body. 4. The afferent and efferent lymphatic vessels of the above groups of lymph nodes have been described in the writers' series of reports. 5. In addition, three kinds of specific lymph streams were distinguished and discussed, as follows : 1) The branch lymph streams of the thoracic duct and jugular trunks were detected in some cases. Some branches of the thoracic duct passed through Lnn. mediastinales craniales, Lnn. tracheobronchiales craniales dextri, as has already been stated in respect to the cat. The writers, furthermore, found for the first time some branches of the thoracic duct which passed through Lnn. mediastinales dorsales, Lnn. tracheobronchiales craniales sinistri, Lnn. tracheobronchiales caudales and Ln. infraclacicularis, and some branches of the jugular trunk which passed through Lnn. anguli <b>brachiocephalici.</b> In the thoracic duct of the cat, the network formation surrounded Aa. intercostales in all cases. 2) Some peripheral lymphatic vessels, originating from the trachea, esophagus, thyroid gland, thymus, diaphragm, costal pleura, testis and ovary, empty directly into the jugular trunk, thoracic duct, lumbar trunk or cisterna chyli without the lymph passing through a node and then pour into the venous angles. The appearance of such lymphatic vessels is related intimately with the degree of occurrence of the special fixed nodes in accordance with the peripheral areas of their origin. It was suggested that such lymphatic vessels maintain an undifferentiated state without developing any appropriate node. 3) The writers found lymphatic communications by which lymph streams reversely among lymph nodes. The communications are divided into three types as follows : type A-connection by which lymph is able to stream reversely through a valveless-like vessel; type B-connection whose lymphatic vessels with single flowing direction alternate with each other among nodes; type C-connection by lymphatic networks with valves at various places. To the matter of this finding, no attention has been paid particularly until now. The occurrences of such communications are more numerous in the body surface than those in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. From the obtained results and from consideration of the development of the lymphatics, it seems that such communications derive from a remainder of a lymphatic plexus which appeared in the course of the developmental process. The third type is C, an original form, which may be changed from type B to type A, a more advanced one. A lymph stream by way of such communications among nodes may flow from the periphery towards the body center in the normal living state. But if the tissue pressure in the peripheral areas is made higher by some conditions, such flow can clearly be reversed. The three kinds of specific lymph vessels should be noted in pathology and physiology to act as a specific pathway of the lymph. 6. The writers divided lymph nodes into three types of Z, T and ZT, and made macroscopic observations with considerations of the structural differences among the nodes of each type. The node of type Z receives only peripheral lymph, that of type T receives only lymph which has passed through other nodes and that of type ZT receives both sorts of lymph. The occurrences of each type differed among the groups of lymph nodes which were determined by their locations. As a rule, no definite differences were macroscopically detected between types Z and ZT, but only type T showed a specific feature; type T is small node, approximately 1 mm in diameter, which does not join into groups at a definite position but appears as an accessory one accompanying types Z and ZT without exception. 7. From the ratio of occurrences, types classified by appearances of afferent vessels and sizes of lymph nodes, the writers suggest, at least, that there is something of structural difference among nodes of 3 groups as follows : 1. nodes of types Z and ZT in the writers' constant and nearly constant groups, 2. nodes of types Z and ZT in the writers' inconstant group, 3. nodes of type T, without falling into groups classified with relation to their ratio of occurrence. The suggestion should be followed up by microscopical observations. 8. In this observation, Neoprene latex was used in an attempt to find whether it was applicable for demonstration of lymphatic vessels. Neoprene latex is within the range of possibility of use as an injection material for comparatively larger vessels, but more advanced study is necessary before it can be recommended for injection into the peripheral lymphatic vessels...|$|R
5000|$|The masseter, or cheek muscle, {{opens and}} closes the jaw and allows chewing. The <b>Brachiocephalicus</b> is a wide {{strap-like}} muscle that begins {{at the base of}} the skull behind the jaw and ends below the point of the shoulder to the humerus. This muscle moves the head from side to side, pulls the scapula forward, raises it in collection, and swings the foreleg forward. It is well developed for good movement, and too strong a rein contact inhibits free forward movement. The Sternocephalic begins at the jowl and ends at the sternum. This muscle moves the head and neck. In ewe-necked or bull-necked horses, this muscle is overdeveloped, and is difficult to get into a relaxed shape. The Rhomboideus begins at the Nuchal ligament and ends at the scapula. It lifts the shoulder and forehand, and pulls the scapula forward. The Splenius begins behind the poll and ends at the beginning of the Trapezius. This muscle turns and extends the neck, and makes up the topline if well developed. The Trapezius is a flat, sheet-like muscle that begins at the Occipital bone and ends at the spines of the 7th cervical and all the thoracic vertebrae. It lifts the shoulder and forehand, and if this muscle is well developed, the horse will work in a good outline. The Nuchal ligament begins at the poll and ends at the withers, and helps the muscles in the neck support the head. The deltoid begins at the scapula and ends at the humerus. The deltoid flexes the shoulder joint, and will load the shoulder if overdeveloped. The Supraspinatus begins below the trapezius and ends at the point of the shoulder; it maintains the shoulder in extension. The Latissimus dorsi begins at the lower thoracic vertebrae and ends at the back of the humerus; it flexes the shoulder and pulls the foreleg back. The Triceps flex the shoulder and extend the elbow; the Biceps flex the elbow and extend the shoulder. The pectoral muscles help pull the foreleg forward. The Triceps Brachii extend the elbow joint; the Biceps Brachii flex the elbow joint. The Extensor carpus extends the knee. The Flexor carpus flexes the knee. The Digital extensor extends the toe and knee. The digital flexor flexes the toe and knee and extends the elbow.|$|E
40|$|Thirteen Najdi male camels {{representing}} two feeding regimens (feedlot vs. grazing) were slaughtered, {{then the}} carcasses were subsequently {{placed in a}} 10 ˚C cooler until 36 h postmortem. The biceps femoris, triceps brachii and <b>brachiocephalicus</b> muscle temperatures and pH were monitored periodically during the 36 -h postmortem period. The muscle temperatures for the feedlot group was slightly (P> 0. 01) higher than the muscles from the grazing group. However, the triceps brachii and biceps femoris muscles had higher (P< 0. 01) temperatures and slower rates of temperature decline than the <b>brachiocephalicus</b> muscle throughout the 36 -h period. The muscle pH values were consistently higher (P< 0. 01) for the grazing group than for the feedlot camels. The differences in pH between muscle types were not significant during the first 8 -h postmortem, thereafter, the <b>brachiocephalicus</b> muscle maintained a significantly (P< 0. 01) higher pH than the biceps femoris and triceps brachii muscles...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the effects of Kinesio Taping on the trajectory of the forelimb and the muscle activity of the M. <b>brachiocephalicus</b> and the M. extensor carpi radialis in horses. 19 horses and ponies of different breeds (body weight: 496 ± 117 kg), gender (8 mares, 10 geldings and 3 stallions) and ages (14. 9 ± 6. 9 years old) were analysed without Kinesio Tape ("no tape"), with Kinesio Tape (muscle facilitation application on both muscles of both sides, "with tape") and immediately after Kinesio Taping ("post tape") through kinematic motion analysis and surface electromyography on a treadmill at the walk (speed: 1. 5 ± 0. 1 m/s) and trot (speed: 3. 1 ± 0. 3 m/s). The results of the surface electromyography (maximum muscle activity at the walk and trot) and the kinematic motion analysis (maximum stride length and maximum height of the forelimbs flight arc at the walk and trot) showed {{that there were no}} significant differences between "no tape", "with tape" and "post tape". To sum up, Kinesio Taping on the M. <b>brachiocephalicus</b> and the M. extensor carpi radialis does not affect (in a positive or negative manner) the trajectory of the forelimb or the muscle activity of the M. <b>brachiocephalicus</b> and the M. extensor carpi radialis in horses...|$|E

40|$|Os ramos do arco aórtico (Arcus aortae) em bubalinos foram investigados neste trabalho. Assim, foram dissecadas as artérias oriundas desse arco previamente injetadas com solução corada de látex Neoprene 650 â (Du Pont do Brasil S.

Em 80 % dos casos, observou-se que o tronco braquiocefálico (Truncus <b>brachiocephalicus)</b> emite a artéria subclávia (Arteria subclavia) esquerda, artérias carótidas comuns (Arteria carotis communis) esquerda e direita, sem caracterizar tronco bicarotídeo (Truncus bicaroticus), e a artéria subclávia direita. As artérias subclávias direita e esquerda originam em comum o tronco costo{{cervical}} (Truncus costocervicalis), a artéria cervical superficial (Arteria cervicalis superficialis), artérias axilares (Arteria axillaris) e artéria torácica interna (Arteria thoracica interna). Em 20 % dos casos, o tronco braquiocefálico origina a artéria subclávia esquerda em comum ao tronco costocervical esquerdo; em seguida, emite a artéria carótida comum esquerda e termina trifurcando-se em artéria carótida comum direita, artéria subclávia direita e tronco costocervical direito, sendo que as artérias subclávias direita e esquerda têm origem comum com as artérias cervical superficial, axilar e torácica interna, com a presença do tronco bicarotídeo, característico dos bovinos. The {{branches of}} the aortic arch (Arcus aortae) of buffaoes were investigated in this study. Therefore, dissections were procedeed in previously injected arteries (using coloured Neoprene latex 650 â - Du Pont do Brasil S.

In 80 % of the cases {{it was observed that}} the brachiocephalic trunk (Truncus <b>brachiocephalicus)</b> gives off the left subclavian artery, (Arteria subclavia) the right and left common carotid arteries (Arteria carotis communis) - being absent the bicarotid trunk (Truncus bicaroticus) - and the right subclavian artery. The right and left subclavian arteries originate in commom the costocervical trunk (Truncus costocervicalis), the cervical superficial artery (Arteria cervicalis superficialis), axillary artery (Arteria axillaris) and internal thoracic artery (Arteria thoracica interna). In 20 % of the cases the brachiocephalic trunk originates the left subclavian artery in common with the left costocervical trunk, and after it does originate the left common carotid artery. It ends spliting up in three vessels: the right commom carotid artery, the right subclavian artery and the right costocervical trunk, remembering that the right and left subclavian arteries have their origin commonly to the superficial cervical artery, the axillary artery and the internal thoracic artery, with the presence of the bicarotid trunk, which is characteristic of bovines...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Congenital {{anomalies}} of the aortic arch, although {{numerous and}} heterogeneous, occur {{in less than}} 1 % of individuals at autopsies. Left aortic arch with an aberrant right subclavian artery, also called arteria lusoria dextra, {{is the most common}} anomaly of the aortic arch, occurring in 0. 5 - 2. 5 % of individuals. Case Outline. We report the case of a 48 -year-old man suffering from acute inferoposterior-wall ST elevation myocardial infarction successfully treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Ten years ago, the patient had undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery with the implantation of two arterial grafts - left and right internal mammary arteries on both left anterior descending and right coronary artery. After several attempts to canulate truncus <b>brachiocephalicus,</b> angiogram revealed the left aortic arch with the aberrant right subclavian artery. To our knowledge, this is the first described case of primary percutaneous coronary intervention via the aberrant right subclavian artery and right internal mammary artery graft with stent implantation in the infarct related lesion of the distal segment of right coronary artery. Subsequent 64 -multidetector computed tomography confirmed the angiographic findings. Conclusion. Early recognition of congenital anomalies of the aortic arch and its great vessels, even before coronary artery bypass graft surgery, could be crucial for the urgent and successful treatment of patients with life-threatening conditions, such as ST segment elevation myocardial infarction...|$|E
40|$|The morphometric {{properties}} and the anatomical relationships {{of the entire}} musculature of the canine cervical spine are reported herein. These data {{were obtained from the}} dissection of cadavers of six dogs. Total muscle length, muscle weight, fascicle length and angles of pennation were recorded for each muscle comprising the canine cervical spine. Based upon these properties, physiological cross-section area (PCSA) and architectural index were estimated. When scaled by whole body mass, the values of each of these parameters were found to be similar between all dogs. Muscles that course from the cranial neck to the shoulder girdle or the rib cage (e. g. <b>brachiocephalicus</b> and rhomboideus capitis) were found to have relatively long fascicles and low PCSA values and thus appear to be designed for rapid excursions. By contrast, muscles that primarily support the neck and shoulder against gravitational forces (e. g. serratus ventralis and trapezius) were found to have relatively high PCSA values and short fascicle lengths, and thus have the capacity to generate large forces. Differences of morphometry as well as nomenclature were found between the canine and human neck musculature. Nevertheless, many similarities exist; in particular, both species have similar muscles adapted to force generation or large excursions. We thus conclude that the canine neck may be used as a modelling tool for biomechanical investigations of the human cervical region as long as the differences listed are borne in mind...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Reference {{values for}} {{quantitative}} electromyography (QEMG) in neck muscles of Royal Dutch Sport horses are lacking. OBJECTIVE: Determine normative data on quantitative motor unit action potential (QMUP) analysis of serratus ventralis cervicis (SV) and <b>brachiocephalicus</b> (BC) muscle. ANIMALS: Seven adult normal horses (mean age 9. 5 standard deviation [SD] +/- 2. 3 years, mean height 1. 64 SD +/- 4. 5 cm, and mean rectal temperature 37. 6 SD +/- 0. 3 degrees C). METHODS: An observational study on QMUP analysis in 6 segments of each muscle was performed with commercial electromyography equipment. Measurements were made according to formerly published methods. Natural logarithm transformed data were tested with ANOVA and posthoc testing according to Bonferroni. RESULTS: Mean duration, amplitude, phases, turns, area, and size index (SI) {{did not differ}} significantly among the 6 segments in each muscle. Mean amplitude, number of phases, and SI were significantly (P <. 002) higher in SV than BC, 520 versus 448 muV, 3. 0 versus 2. 8 muV, and 0. 48 versus 0. 30 muV, respectively. In SV 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for amplitude, duration, number of phases, turns, polyphasia area, and SI were 488 - 551 muV, 4. 3 - 4. 6 ms, 2. 9 - 3. 0, 2. 4 - 2. 6, 7 - 12 %, 382 - 448, and 0. 26 - 0. 70, respectively; in BC this was 412 - 483 muV, 4. 3 - 4. 7 ms, 2. 7 - 2. 8, 2. 4 - 2. 6, 4 - 7 %, 393 - 469, and 0. 27 - 0. 34, respectively. Maximal voluntary activity expressed by turns/second {{did not differ significantly}} between SV and BC with a 95 % CI of 132 - 173 and 137 - 198, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The establishment of normative data makes objective QEMG of paraspinal muscles in horses suspected of cervical neurogenic disorders possible. Differences between muscles should be taken into account...|$|E
