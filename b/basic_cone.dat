40|$|The {{classical}} {{perceptron algorithm}} is an elementary row-action/relaxation algorithm for solving a homogeneous linear inequal-ity system Ax> 0. A natural condition measure {{associated with this}} algorithm is the Euclidean width of the cone of feasible solutions, and the iteration complexity of the perceptron algorithm is bounded by 1 / 2 [see Rosenblatt, F. 1962. Princi-ples of Neurodynamics. Spartan Books, Washington, DC]. Dunagan and Vempala [Dunagan, J., S. Vempala. 2007. A simple polynomial-time rescaling algorithm for solving linear programs. Math. Programming 114 (1) 101 – 114] have developed a rescaled version of the perceptron algorithm with an improved complexity of On ln 1 / iterations (with high probability), which is theoretically efficient in and, in particular, is polynomial time in the bit-length model. We explore extensions of the concepts of these perceptron methods to the general homogeneous conic system Ax ∈ intK, where K is a regular convex cone. We provide a conic extension of the rescaled perceptron algorithm based {{on the notion of}} a deep-separation oracle of a cone, which essentially computes a certificate of strong separation. We show that the rescaled perceptron algorithm is theoretically efficient if an efficient deep-separation oracle is available for the feasible region. Furthermore, when K is the cross-product of <b>basic</b> <b>cones</b> that are either half-spaces or second-order cones, then a deep-separation oracle is available and, hence, the rescaled perceptron algorithm is theoretically efficient. When the <b>basic</b> <b>cones</b> of K include semidefinite cones, then a probabilistic deep-separation oracle for K can be constructed that also yields a theoretically efficient version of the rescaled perceptron algorithm...|$|R

40|$|The {{stratigraphy}} of Esja {{is described}} and the chronology of the succession established {{by means of}} the geomagnetic time scale. The Esja volcanic succession is about 2. 4 km thick, and comprises olivine tholeiites (25 %), tholeiites (68 %), basaltic andesites (5 %), icelandites and rhyolites (2 %). Volcanism was active in the Esja region for just over one million years, and during this time span,. at least ten glaciations occurred in the region. The stratigraphic succession is therefore characterized by sequences of lava flows intercalated, at intervals, by thick subglacial hyaloclastite units. Two central volcanoes were active in the Esja region; the Kjalarnes volcano was active for about 0. 6 million years and was succeeded after a short interval by the Stardalur volcano, which remained active for about 0. 3 million years. Flood-basalt volcanism was concomitant with the central volcanism, and most of the olivine tholeiites are considered to have been erupted in fissures and shield volcanoes unrelated to the central volcanoes. Igneous activity apparently migrated eastwards with time, reflecting the westward crustal drift away from the active volcanic zone, which is a subaerial extension of the mid-Atlantic ridge. The volcanics are tilted and downfaulted towards the east. The irregular topography created by the glaciations in Esja repeatedly prevented lavas erupted in the active volcanic zone from spreading over the tectonically less active neighbour- hood, thus producing angular unconformities in the stratigraphic succession from which the tectonic history of the region can be read. The Esja evidence suggests that tectonic activity is chiefly restricted to the active volcanic zone, and that the crust becomes tectonically inactive soon after it has drifted away from the active zone. Intrusive activity in Esja can be divided into three phases. The oldest dykes in the region trend N 25 Â°E and contemporaneous sheets dip towards the Kjalarnes peninsula, where the intrusive activity culminated in the formation of a multiple dolerite sheet. This intrusion may have been preceded by a caldera collapse in the Kjalarnes area. After the intrusion of the Kjalarnes dolerites the regional trend of dykes changed to N 40 Â°E, and a narrow dyke swarm (representing up to 20 % dilation) cut across the Kjalarnes central volcano. The dyke swarm was succeeded by cone sheets focussing to the south of Leidhamrar, and the second phase culminated in the intrusion of large dolerite sheets in Ãverfell and LauganÃ­pa. Following a brief interval, during which flood-basalt volcanism was dominant in Esja, the Stardalur central volcano became active and, during its life span, minor intrusions were predominantly in sheet form. Caldera collapse in the Stardalur volcano was followed by the intrusion of <b>basic</b> <b>cone</b> sheets, large dolerite sheets, a sill and finally a laccolith within the caldera. Long after the caldera had been filled the caldera fault zone dominated over the regional fault pattern at depth so that basic and acid volcanics alike were erupted concentrically with and parasitically to the Stardalur caldera. Large dolerite intrusions in Esja are found chiefly within or at the boundaries of the thick hyaloclastite units, and there is evidence of dykes cutting straight through lava successions, but spreading out laterally to form sill-like bodies once they enter the less coherent hyaloclastites. A survey of the literature shows that the majority of large basic intrusions. in Iceland are accommodated in relatively soft and "structureless" host rocks, such as tuffaceous hyaloclastites, sediments, vent and caldera agglomerates, hydrothermally propylitized lavas, and "hot" and still partly liquid acid intrusive material. The majority of the large intrusions are in the form of inclined sheets, but sills and laccoliths are formed when the intrusions are emplaced at shallow levels (perhaps less than 1 km) in the crust. The coincidence of central volcanoes having a great bulk of shallow level intrusions, with positive gravity anomalies, and the sites of shallow depth to layer 3 in Iceland strongly suggests that crustal layer 3 consists mostly of basic intrusions. A comparison of the densities of primary and secondary minerals of tholeiitic rocks suggests that infilling of vesicles of porous basalt lavas by secondary minerals will not make the rock as dense as a non-porous rock of the same composition. The estimated density difference of 0. 2 g/cm 3 between crustal layers 2 and 3 can apparently not be ascribed to secondary alteration of subaerial lavas, but can readily be explained by a transition from altered lavas to non-porous intrusives. It is proposed that the sharp boundary between layers 2 and 3 results from the lavas at the base of layer 2 reaching a degree of alteration at which the rock becomes sufficiently incoherent to accommodate large basic intrusions. The "metamorphic boundary" proposed by PÃ¡lmason (1971) to explain the correlation between the thermal gradient and depth to layer 3 in Iceland is not therefore primarily a density boundary, but a boundary at which the lavas loose their strength as a result of alteration and host voluminous dense intrusives. The large scale features of crustal layer 3 in Iceland can be explained within the framework of this model. There is a complete range in composition from olivine tholeiites to rhyolites in the Esja volcanic succession, and the majority of the rocks contain some phenocrysts. Crystal fractionation appears to be a feasible mechanism to explain the chemical variation within at least the basaltic rocks in Esja, but whether the intermediate and acid rocks are formed by extensive fractionation or by partial melting of crustal material cannot be answered. The apparent coincidence in time of the emplacement of large basic intrusives and the commencement of intermediate and acid volcanism in eastern Esja may suggest that the rise of voluminous basic magmas has raised the thermal gradient sufficiently to produce the intermediate and acid rocks by partial melting {{at the base of the}} crust. Positive gravity anomalies associated with the Kjalarnes and Stardalur central volcanoes are attributed to high level intrusives in the core regions of the two centres. Specific gravity measurements of the chemically analysed rocks from Esja show a range of densities from about 2. 5 (rhyolite) to about 3. 15 g/cm 3 (olivine tholeiite). Local gravity anomalies commonly found associated with central volcanoes are probably due both to local concentrations of rocks of different chemistry and to a high percentage of intrusives. A comparison of the average density of the crust in eastern Iceland and that of the crust on the Iceland-Faeroe ridge suggests that a considerable part of the negative Bouguer gravity anomaly of Iceland (Einarsson 1954) can be explained in terms of geochemical differences between the volcanics of Iceland and those of the surrounding areas. The similarity of the gravity profiles from the aseismic Iceland-Faeroe ridge and from the active Reykjanes ridge to the centre of Iceland suggests that, if a hot spot contributes to the bowl-shaped gravity anomaly of Iceland (Bott et al 1971), then it is not connected with layer 4 under the Reykjanes ridge. A positive magnetic anomaly associated with the Stardalur caldera is explained in terms of a thick pile of normal polarity eruptives within the caldera being surrounded essentially by reverse polarity eruptives. The combined effects of a high magnetite content (which may be caused by unusually high partial pressure of oxygen in the melt) and a high palaeofield strength may cause the very high magnetic intensity of lavas, which give rise to a sharp maximum within the Stardalur magnetic anomaly. Assuming a common cause for three other strong magnetic anomalies, which, with Stardalur, lie on a straight line and are separated regularly in space and time, the possibility of a mantle controlled "high partial pressure of oxygen spot" migrating at half the spreading speed along the spreading axis is discussed. </p...|$|E

There has been relatively little work done on gross morphology and comparative biology of these snails. Recent work has shown a novel mechanism in their proboscis that uses a harpoon to inject toxin into a prey item. Their rapid evolution and specialization has produced three <b>basic</b> groups of <b>cone</b> snails; vermivores, piscivores and molluscivores.

Through an integrated approach we have discovered ciliated sensory organs (?sensory papillae?) near the distal tip of this proboscis. Scanning electron microscopy has shown these structures to be similar within species {{of at least two}} of the three groups. Confocal and fluorescent microscopy was used to see extensive innervation within the proboscis leading up to the sensory papillae. Additional studies using fluorescent microscopy, light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that these complex sensory structures can regenerate after the tip of the proboscis has been ablated, which happens in the wild as well as in lab settings.

40|$|The main {{geological}} {{feature of}} the research area is a Tertiary flood basalt pile, about 2. 7 km thick, within which are three Tertiary central volcanoes. The "basement" consists of faulted and tilted basalts, probably about 12 - 13 m. y. old. These basalts were overlain by the Hredavatn sedimentary horizon, 7 m. y. ago, followed by lavas of the Hallarrauli central volcano which was active from 6. 7 to 6. 0 m. y, ago. The time sequence of the volcanism was of acid ignimbrites, then intermediate flows, and finally thin tholeiite flows. The volcano did not evolve the structural or geothermal characteristics usually associated with central volcanoes. The Reykjadalur central volcano became active about 5. 8 m. y. ago and is situated {{on a series of}} thick tholeiite flows which overlie unconformably the Hallarrauli central volcano. Voluminous acidic and some intermediate rocks formed first and were succeeded by thin tholeiite flows. A collapse caldera, 10 km in diameter, then formed and was filled with volcanics. After the formation of the caldera, a <b>basic</b> to acid <b>cone</b> sheet swarm, about 20 km in diameter and concentric to the caldera, intruded the country rocks. About 4. 3 - 4. 4 m. y, ago, soon before the volcano became extinct, a massive icecap covered the volcano and its environs; the Holtavorduheidi sedimentary horizon covered the area east and southeast of the volcano at this time. The Laugardalur central volcano consists of a caldera and its volcanic filling; it may be parasitic to the Reykjadalur central volcano. Later, 3. 4 m. y, ago, acid tephra was erupted from the Litla Baula vent and the Baula acid intrusion was emplacedat this time. Volcanic activity was renewed about 2 m. y. ago, represented by the Snjofjoll series and a few more recent volcanics. The Tertiary basalts are tholeiitic. The rocks from the central volcanoes show a trimodal volume distribution, with basalts and rhyolites more abundant than rocks of intermediate compositions. Three distinct breaks occur in the chemical properties : between the olivine tholeiites and the quartz tholeiites; between the quartz tholeiites and the basaltic icelandites; and within the dacites. The basalts were derived from the Upper Mantle, olivine tholeiites being produced by a greater degree of partial melting and/or at greater depths than the quartz tholeiites. On volume and time relations and on geocheraical grounds, the acid and intermediate volcanics are considered to be derived by two-stage melting of the Icelandic lower crust. The acid magmas were generated first, followed by intermediate magmas from partially melting the residuum at a higher temperature. Although this process is fuelled by basaltic intrusions within the lower crust, the late appearance of basalts in the central, volcanoes is attributed to the density-depth relations between the crust and the rising magma...|$|R
