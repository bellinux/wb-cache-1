The DSPBV was sized to process 10 gal/hr of hazardous waste at up to 399 {degree}C (750 {degree}F) and 5000 psia (34. 5 MPa) with a residence time of 10 min. The first prototype reactor is a certified ASME pressure vessel. It was purchased by Innotek Corporation (licensee) and shipped to Pacific Northwest Laboratory for testing.

40|$|Case StudyDuring the startup {{of one of}} the {{compression}} trains of an offshore platform, in August/ 2006, excessively high vibrations were observed at the high pressure compressor. The same problem was also verified one week later, during the preliminary tests of the String Test for the compressors of other two offshore platforms, which were supplied by the same vendor. The vibration records showed that the high vibration was due to the synchronous vibration component (1 X vibration) and that it increased with the gas temperature. The Vendor?s previous experience with this problem, which was designated as Thermal Induced Unbalance Vibration, indicated that this could happen when there were mounted components secured to the shaft through two interference fits. This was true for the <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> of the high pressure compressor of P- 50. The design of this component, with a cylindrical shape, was not usual, but was employed because of the small diameter of the component. The same design was repeated on the HP compressors of P- 53 and P- 54. After modifying the <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> of the HP compressor at the test bed, a high level of vibration has been again observed in the following pre-test. The analysis of the vibration records showed that now the problem was more related to pressurization, rather than to a thermal effect.

40|$|The {{design of}} the gas seals used in {{centrifugal}} compressors and axial turbines requires to consider not only their aptitude to reduce leakage, but also their contribution to the overall dynamics of the machine. Honeycomb and hole pattern annular seals are often employed in compressors for the end <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> seal or as the central <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> seal in a back-to-back arrangement. In contrast to labyrinth seals, they show a beneficial damping effect. In order to obtain an effective tool for predicting the leakage and the dynamic response of honeycomb seals, a bulk flow model has been devised in the past and, implemented in numerical codes, it is presently used in the design process. This kind of codes, however, require simplifying assumptions: in particular, one reference code available to the authors adopts the hypothesis of isothermal process. As the required level of confidence in seal design is increasing, an experimental validation and possibly some refinement are needed. In this work, the bulk flow model was reviewed and the sensitivity to different hypotheses was explored.

40|$|The {{high-pressure}} oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP) {{consists of}} two centrifugal pumps, on a common shaft, that are directly driven by a hot-gas turbine. Pump shaft axial thrust is balanced in that the double-entry main inducer/impeller is inherently balanced and the thrusts of the preburner pump and turbine are nearly equal but opposite. Residual shaft thrust is controlled by a self-compensating, non-rubbing, <b>balance</b> <b>piston.</b> Shaft hang-up must be avoided if the <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> is to perform properly.

40|$|LecturePg. 9 - 20 This paper {{discusses}} the rotordynamic instability problems experienced with two separate centrifugal compressors. While {{the root causes}} of the instabilities are very different, the analysis methodology of reconciling the rotordynamic model with measured vibration data was the same. The first problem occurred with a propylene compressor in a Gulf Coast chemical plant that had experienced high journal bearing temperatures for several years. A modified bearing was installed to alleviate the temperature problem; however, a large subsynchronous vibration appeared after the new bearings were installed. A lateral stability analysis shows that the compressor with the modified bearings was very stable with the aerodynamic destabilizing effect predicted by the Alford and/or Wachel equation. A comparison analysis was made of the stability predicted with the original bearings (which were stable) as well as the modified bearings (which were not). This allowed the user to determine the magnitude of the destabilizing forces present in the compressor and design a new bearing that was both stable and would operate at an acceptable temperature. The new bearing was installed and the compressor has operated without the subsynchronous vibration for {{the past year and a}} half. The second problem occurred with a very similar ethylene compressor in a Midwest ethylene plant. The compressor had operated for over two years after an overhaul with low vibration. Then a subsynchronous vibration appeared that was very erratic, but was slowly increasing in amplitude over time. To solve the problem, a rotordynamic analysis was performed that suggested that replacing the bearing would solve the stability problem However, comparison between the measure field vibration and the rotordynamic model did not agree on all points. A more indepth look at the compressor revealed that the increase in subsynchronous vibration was tracking very closely with the balance line differential pressure. This fact, along with the characteristics of the <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> seal, suggested that a bearing change alone may not completely address the problem A new <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> seal was designed to reduce its destabilizing effects on the rotor. The compressor was inspected during the next scheduled downtime to determine the cause of the high vibration and install the new <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> seal and bearings. Examination of the internals revealed a large seal rub in the compressor, but at the dry gas seals, not the <b>balance</b> <b>piston.</b> The rub was addressed and the subsynchronous vibration was eliminated. While the exact source of the destabilizing force was not correctly ?guessed? before disassembly, the indepth rotordynamic analysis did reveal that there was a large destabilizing force in the compressor, and a bearing change alone would not eliminate the vibration. The compressor has been operating without the subsynchronous problem for the past year since the modification...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 41 - 50 The {{cause and}} effects of a large subsynchronous {{vibration}} (3. 5 mils at 3490 cpm) in an FCC wet gas compressor are examined. The compressor is driven at 7850 rpm by a 6000 hp electric motor, through a speed-increasing gearbox, and compresses hydrocarbon gases from 20 psig to 235 psig. A rotordynarnic analysis of the compressor determined {{that even though the}} compressor had a long history (approximately 25 years) of smooth operation (overall amplitudes less than 0. 5 mils), it had a very low margin of stability. This lack of stability was caused by a high bearing to shaft stiffness ratio as well as destabilizing forces in the <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> and shaft seals. The pressure dam bearing design is not destabilizing to the rotor system because the journal is very heavily loaded; however, the high direct stiffness that is produced reduces the effective damping of the system. Labyrinth and oil seals are usually not considered to have large effects on a compressor with such low pressures. However, the atmospheric side of the oil seal was determined to contribute the largest destabilizing effect. The effective length to diameter (LID) ratio of the oil seal was reduced by 50 percent to lower the amount of cross-coupled stiffness the seal produces. This modification reduced the subsynchronous vibration from 3. 5 mils to 0. 1 mils. The rotordynarnic analysis also identified other modifications to the bearing and <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> design that should be made to increase the rotor's margin of stability.

These high-level stability analyses include predictions of impeller and seal rotordynamic forces and even extra effort on design and analysis of special damping devices as a backup, such as damper bearings and seals. Several moderate-pressure compressors were selected here to discuss the use of stability screening diagrams and the proposed API screening criteria. These compressors are operating successfully {{with or without a}} deswirl mechanism. However, most of them fail to pass the proposed new API screening. Furthermore, rotor aerodynamic logarithmic-decrements (log-decrements or log-dec) were predicted by implementing equivalent aerodynamic destabilizing forces that were calculated using Wachel?s equation, the API proposed equation, and the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) empirical method, respectively. In practice, shunt injection and swirl-brakes are standard tools to enhance rotor stability if the predicted log-decrement is relatively low. When adopted with <b>balance</b> <b>pistons</b> or center seals, the swirl brakes are typically installed behind the impeller and outside the labyrinth seal. However, the deswirl effect of the swirl brake is sometimes limited due to its locations away from the entrance of the <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> or center labyrinth seal. Meanwhile, the implantation of the swirl brake would change the flow pattern behind the final stage impeller backwall. A unique antiswirl brake device was developed to integrate with typical labyrinth seals for improving high-performance compressor stability. The effectiveness of the antiswirl brake mechanism was experimentally investigated when used with the labyrinth seals on a rotating test rig.

Unfortunately, hammering is inherent to conventional two-cylinder piston-driven steam locomotives {{and that is one of}} the several reasons they have been retired from service.|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 25 - 34 The American Petroleum Institute (API) has {{recently}} implemented new rotordynamic stability specifications for centrifugal compressors. The specifications {{consist of a}} Level I analysis that approximates the destabilizing effect of the labyrinth seals and aerodynamic excitations. A modified Alford?s equation is used to approximate the destabilizing effects. If the compressor fails the Level I specifications, a more sophisticated Level II analysis is required that includes a detailed labyrinth seal analysis. Five modern high-pressure example centrifugal compressors are considered along with a classic instability case, Kaybob. After applying API Level I and Level II stability analyses and reviewing the results, design changes are made to stabilize the compressors, if necessary. For these cases, the API stability specifications are used to identify the component with {{the greatest impact on}} rotor stability. Specifically, the <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> seal and impeller eye seals are analyzed. The suitability of applying the modified Alford?s equation to compressors with multiple process stages is examined and compared to the full labyrinth seal analysis. Important aspects of labyrinth seal analyses are discussed, such as seal clearance effects, inlet swirl effects, and converging, diverging clearance effects. Finally, a modal approach to applying the labyrinth seal calculated cross-coupled forces is presented., For all five example compressors, the modified Alford?s force was determined to produce the worst case stability level compared to labyrinth calculated forces...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 21 - 30 A {{high speed}} (15, 200 rpm) {{refrigeration}} centrifugal recycle compressor was experiencing severe reliability problems resulting in short run times between major overhauls. Typical run times were one to 12 weeks. The symptoms identified {{at the start}} of the project included oil foaming in the closed loop oil sump on the end of the compressor, sudden and severe damage to the <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> and interstage seals shortly after startup, high thrust bearing oil drain temperature (due to high <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> leakage), and high levels of process contaminant fouling on the impellers during operation. A solution was pursued using a systems approach including review of repair practices, hardware installation, operating practices, lubrication system design, and rotordynamic analysis of the rotorbearing system. Review of casing vibration during a startup cycle of the compressor was found to include evidence of surging, and generally high amplitude casing vibration even though the casing to rotor weight ration was very large (~ 40 : 1). Inspection and review of the lubrication system indicated that the system had previously been modified on several occasions from the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) design in various attempt to improve the compressor reliability. In addition, several grades of oil including synthetic were used at various times. However, the oil sump continued to exhibit heavy foaming not just during startup but under normal continuous operation. Although the rotor design appeared to be consistent over the life of the machine, the journal bearings were reported to have been changed to several different styles, including pressure dam bearings, fixed lobe, and with various bearing materials of construction. Oil foaming problems under continuous operating conditions were eliminated by repair of clogged oil mist coalescing elements in the oil sump, and improving the oil/refrigerant flow paths into the oil sump. A complete lateral rotordynamics study found that the existing bearings were not a good choice and that the rotor was operating on the first critical speed. New bearings were optimized and a ?dummy? impeller was added to the rotor to reduce the critical speed to well below operating speed. The results of the bearing and rotor modifications reduced the amplification factor from 19 to less than 2. 5 at the first critical speed, and predicted a 90 percent reduction in center-span operating speed vibration amplitudes for a given level of rotor unbalance, greatly reducing the risk for internal rubs. The tremendous success of this project emphasizes the clear requirement to address problems of this sort using a systematic, engineered approach as opposed to a trial and error solution strategy. The charge of the reliability improvement team was to identify positive changes that could be reasonably implemented to lengthen run time to repair. The final solution included some rather simple maintenance modifications (oil system) as well as some very sophisticated hardware modifications (bearing and rotor design changes). However, review of the whole system was necessary to identify the key components that would lead to rapid success in the plant...|$|R
