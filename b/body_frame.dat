As of September 3, 2011, Akiyama has stated he will move down a weight class, allowing {{him to stay in}} the UFC.

25|$|Precession, nutation, and {{intrinsic}} rotation (spin) {{are defined}} as the movements obtained by changing one of the Euler angles while leaving the other two constant. These motions are not {{expressed in terms of}} the external frame, or in terms of the co-moving rotated <b>body</b> <b>frame,</b> but in a mixture. They constitute a mixed axes of rotation system, where the first angle moves the line of nodes around the external axis z, the second rotates around the line of nodes and the third one is an intrinsic rotation around an axis fixed in the body that moves.|$|E

They constitute a mixed axes of rotation system, where the first angle moves the line of nodes around the external axis z, the second rotates around the line of nodes and the third one is an intrinsic rotation around an axis fixed in the body that moves.|$|E
25|$|K 177: Hamilton, Victoria. Following {{withdrawal}} from service, this locomotive {{was sold to}} the Langhi Morgala Museum in Ararat and placed on display. It was subsequently acquired by the Mornington Railway Preservation Society and transferred to Moorooduc. Further inspection revealed a number of parts beyond restoration, so a complex deal was worked out with other organisations over the late 1990s. The end result was that the frame of K 177 was placed at Hamilton, Victoria, along with its own coupled wheels, motion gear and smoke deflectors. K 159 donated the tender <b>body,</b> <b>frame</b> and bogies, and K 174 provided the boiler, smokebox, funnel and pony truck. The engine is currently un-numbered, but during the transition process it was alternately known as the Hamilton Exchange Locomotive or K 193.|$|E
500|$|Mature rams (males) weigh about , while ewes (females) weigh about [...] The <b>body</b> <b>frame</b> is long, with a {{straight}} back and a rump that slopes toward {{the base of the}} tail. The rams have short scrotums free of wool which hold the testicles closer to the body than those of modern breeds, while the ewes have small udders free of wool that are also held closer to the body than those of modern breeds. The head is slender and triangular, and clear of wool forward of the horns and on the cheeks. The tail is long and woolly, extending almost to the hock if it has not been docked. Jacob owners do not usually dock the tail completely, even for market sheep, but instead leave several inches (several centimetres) to cover the anus and vulva. The legs are medium-length, slender, free of wool below the knees, and preferably white with or without coloured patches. The hooves are black or striped. It is not unusual for Jacobs to be cow-hocked. They provide a lean carcass with little external fat, with a high yield of meat compared to more improved breeds.|$|E

Approximately twenty of these chassis were built, although only three were purchased as a kit with the fiberglass bodyshell that Wilkinson had originally selected; these three cars used an RGS Atalanta body manufactured by special builder Richard G. Shattock. With the Atalanta body included in the kit, the car was named the [...] "TVR Sports Saloon". The kit was first offered for sale in 1954 for Â£650. It was with this car that TVR first produced a brochure to advertise a product: it quoted some figures, such as the car's 1400lb weight and 0-60mph time of 13 seconds. It was also on the Sports Saloon that the first incarnation of TVR's badge appeared, designed by a young art student and Wilkinson's friend, John Cookson.|$|E
