In the analog versions of these experiments, horizontal layers of sand are pulled along a lower surface into a <b>back</b> <b>stop,</b> which results in realistic-looking patterns of faulting {{and the growth of}} a critically tapered (all angles remain the same) orogenic wedge. Numerical models work {{in the same way as}} these analog models, though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt.

2500|$|He has {{the ability}} to play the Dilscoop (which was invented by Sri Lankan Tillakaratne Dilshan or {{precisely}} the ramp shot, which involves the batsman squatting down and scooping deliveries back over the wicketkeeper's area. The two shots has its own distinction, where Dilscoop is played right above the wicket-keeper's head, but ramp shot can be played in sideways of the wicket-keeper as well. Playing this ramp shot in a Twenty20 International match on 28 February 2010 in Lancaster Park, against Australia, he managed to hit Shaun Tait for two sixes in an over back over Brad Haddin's head, forcing Australia to set a <b>back</b> <b>stop</b> (the fielder near the boundary behind the wicketkeeper or first slip) in his final test match. [...] He can also execute reverse sweep well. He also likes to cut, cover drive, or advance the wicket to punch the ball up for boundaries from a batting stance standing on or outside leg stump.|$|E
2500|$|While {{installation}} of a new cycle track in the city decreases the number of accidents along the cycle track itself beyond the expected number of accidents, a study of newly installed bicycle tracks in Copenhagen actually showed, taking into account correction factors for crash trends, traffic volumes and regression-to-the-mean, {{that the number of}} accidents increased by 9% compared to the expected number of accidents [...] (without new cycle path). There was a significant increase of accidents in intersections following the {{installation of}} cycle tracks at intersections. However, since the number of bicyclists increased by 18-20% following installation of the cycle tracks, individual accident rates actually dropped when bicycle infrastructure was added. Since its publication, the city has used the conclusions of the report to improve safety in intersections. Notable improvements include rebuilding dangerous intersections, pulling <b>back</b> <b>stop</b> lines for cars to improve visibility of cyclists, and expanding the use of bicycle traffic lights, to give pre-greens for cyclists. Overall there were 92 cyclists involved serious injury and 3 deaths in 2010, down from 252 incidents in 1996, when the city began a concerted effort to bring down the number of injuries. A cyclist will now on average cycle [...] before being involved in a serious accident.|$|E

If I had turned round, and if Laura had seen my face at that moment----Thank God, she was absorbed over her drawing! They soon parted. The man from the Asylum went one way, and the Count the other. I began to hope they were in the street by chance, till I saw the Count come <b>back,</b> <b>stop</b> opposite to us again, take out his card-case and pencil, write something, and then cross the road to the shop below us. I ran past Laura before she could see me, and said I had forgotten something upstairs. As soon as I was out of the room I went down to the first landing and waited--I was determined to stop him if he tried to come upstairs. He made no such attempt. The girl from the shop came through the door into the passage, with his card in her hand--a large gilt card with his name, and a coronet above it, and these lines underneath in pencil: 'Dear lady' (yes! the villain could address me in that way still)--'dear lady, one word, I implore you, on a matter serious to us both.' If one can think at all, in serious difficulties, one thinks quick. I felt directly that it might be a fatal mistake to leave myself and to leave you in the dark, where such a man as the Count was concerned. I felt that the doubt of what he might do, in your absence, would be ten times more trying to me if I declined to see him than if I consented. 'Ask the gentleman to wait in the shop,' I said. 'I will be with him in a moment.' I ran upstairs for my bonnet, being determined not to let him speak to me indoors. I knew his deep ringing voice, and I was afraid Laura might hear it, even in the shop. In less than a minute I was down again in the passage, and had opened the door into the street. He came round to meet me from the shop. There he was in deep mourning, with his smooth bow and his deadly smile, and some idle boys and women near him, staring at his great size, his fine black clothes, and his large cane with the gold knob to it. All the horrible time at Blackwater came back to me the moment I set eyes on him. All the old loathing crept and crawled through me, when he took off his hat with a flourish and spoke to me, as if we had parted on the friendliest terms hardly a day since." ...|$|E

50|$|In fast pitch, {{the batter}} has {{a wall or}} fence as a <b>back</b> <b>stop.</b> A {{rectangle}} is drawn on the artificial backstop {{in order to create}} a strike zone. The rectangle is chalked. If the batter does not swing and any part of the ball has chalk on it when it bounces back to the pitcher, the result is a called strike. If there is no chalk on the ball, the result is a ball. This type of play is most commonly seen in schoolyards throughout South Philadelphia, North Philadelphia, Staten Island, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Long Island. It is played to a lesser extent in Queens and Jersey City, New Jersey. In some variants, an additional dot is drawn on the backstop approximately two feet away from the main strike zone to create a further, somewhat random, location where a pitch will be considered a strike.|$|E
