50|$|As {{the wealthiest}} country in Latin America and an OPEC member, Venezuela {{has been more}} {{frequently}} a donor than a recipient of foreign assistance. The United States stopped providing aid to Venezuela in the mid-1960s; nor did any <b>bilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>agency</b> give Venezuela assistance. Instead, Venezuela's bilateral economic relations were characterized by technical cooperation agreements, student exchange programs, or commercial accords similar to those signed by the major industrial nations. Its oil wealth in the 1970s, however, did allow the country to become a major provider of bilateral and multilateral financing. From 1974 to 1981, the nation contributed US$7.3 billion to international development, 64 percent of which went to multilateral sources, such as the United Nations Special Fund, the Andean Reserve Fund, the OPEC Fund, the Coffee Stabilization Fund, the Caribbean Development Bank, and the Central American Bank for Integration, among others. In addition, Caracas was {{the headquarters of the}} affiliates or institutes of many regional and international organizations. Total annual contributions in the late 1970s averaged 1.88 percent of GDP, above the 1 percent level suggested by the United Nations for developed countries. Most bilateral assistance, funneled through the FIV, went to Andean nations, Central America, and the Caribbean. Venezuela used this oil wealth to enlarge its profile in regional and international affairs, a prestige it aggressively sought.|$|E
40|$|The {{strengthening}} of women's participation in all spheres of life {{has become a}} major issue in the discourse of economic and social development in the last decades. Virtually every international and <b>bilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>agency</b> has proclaimed policies to integrate women better into economic and social processes. The promotion of women in politics, however, especially if {{it is supposed to be}} implemented through affirmative action is still contested. This is in spite of the fact that women, who form around 50 % of total world population, share a considerably lower presence in elected political bodies: Women made up only 11. 6 % of MPs in 176 parliaments in 1995 (IDEA 2002). Apparently universal franchise is inadequate to overcome structural constraints that impede female presence in political offices. Thus, despite their numerical strength, women are still a minority in respect to political power and positions occupied. Interestingly enough India is one of the countries where a women's quota of 33 % was introduced at least at the local level. The same strategy for the State Assemblies and the National Parliament is still highly contested and the so-called "Women's Bill" failed thrice to be passed so far. At the same time, some readers might be astonished that India has realised a women's quota at all, since India is often portrayed as backward in regard to women's position in society. News on dowry deaths, widow burning, and the abortion of female foetuses still dominate the rather undifferentiated public image of India. Nevertheless, in 1992 the 73 rd Amendment to the Indian Constitution laid down new rules for the establishment and design of rural local government (called Panchayati Raj). This Amendment also stipulates that at least 33 % of the seats and positions have to be filled by women. Proponents of this measure believe that the quota for women will lead to their empowerment, whereas critics claim that those women will be mere "proxies" for influential males and will be mainly drawn from the elite. The opponents furthermore point out that women in rural India are not equipped for participating in politics, since they lack basic qualifications. Indeed, India's rural social structure can still be characterized as being predominantly patriarchal. Women face restricted mobility in the public space; yet, this differs with respect to caste, class, religion as well as age and family status. As already mentioned, treating women as a political group with common concerns provokes the question in how far gender actually transcends caste, class or ethnic affiliation. Which interests should the elected women represent - those of other women, of their caste, clan or religious community? How can rural women, who are initially without doubt less equipped for political office (lower formal education, less political experience, less public exposure etc.), overcome these inhibitions? And how do male colleagues, officials and the village communities react if they are forced to elect and deal with female representatives? In order to pay tribute to the contextual nature of empowerment this study was conducted in a single State of the Indian Union. Orissa was selected because it is in one of the most "backward" States in the Indian Union and thus presents an environment that is not very conducive for women's empowerment to begin with. If one can prove that empowerment happens in such a setting, it is fair to assume that it should definitely take place in a location which provides better conditions, like, e. g. in a State like Kerala. Therefore, the selection of a "worst-case scenario" permits to draw more general conclusions. A quantitative survey was conducted with 105 women and 80 men mainly at the gram panchayat and few at the panchayat samiti level during the first field trip in 1998 / 99. In the second round in 1999 / 2000, selected female representatives, male panchayat members, officials, villagers and women's groups were interviewed in intensive semi-structured interviews...|$|E

Development theorists have utilised various theoretical perspectives to understand and explain the complex nature of the region&# 039;s underdevelopment. To date, optimism has faded into pessimism as many of the social indicators for Sub-Sahara Africa continue to deteriorate, raising more questions than answers regarding such a disparity. This article critically examines the reasons why Sub-Sahara Africa&# 039;s development continues to lag behind. Employing "Alternative development", "Alternatives to development", and Post-development" theories we explain why the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) alone are no panacea to poverty alleviation but rather a blueprint. We contend that Sub-Sahara Africa&# 039;s problems transcend the simplistic development views of western epistemology. Rather they reflect the tension that exists between externally driven and/or imposed development agendas and the indigenous ways of social development. In addition, Sub-Sahara Africa&# 039;s development challenges are structurally induced. As such, achieving the MDGs will require a multifarious approach to addressing poverty...|$|R

In contrast to the wide normative use of the concept as quasi-self-implementing, this article surveys the institutional development of the water sector in the industrialised and developing countries in comparison to the standards of IWRM. It finds changes towards the integration in a number of countries, but to a limited extent as result of the new policy consensus. These changes on the national level have international implications beyond their demonstration value, as they form the institutional basis for the management of transboundary water resources. Here, a change can be identified, as the regimes of transboundary rivers have changed to a considerable extent to broaden towards a more integrated manner.

The middle-income designation {{implied that the}} government of Moldova was not eligible for concessionary lending from the World Bank and IMF, and would not receive concessionary finance from the major <b>bilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>agencies.</b> After demonstrating that assigning middle-income status to Moldova was a mistake, which was implicitly conceded by the World Bank in 1997, this Country Study investigates the consequences. It uses a simple procedure for calculating counterfactual scenarios based on assigning Moldova low-income status in the early 1990 s. The counterfactual scenarios suggest that the development and welfare costs of the mistake were extremely high: a much greater fall in income per capita than would otherwise have been the case, with an associated increase in headcount poverty and lower life expectancy. There is a cruel irony associated with this mistake. Had Moldova been designated a low-income country in the early 1990 s, it would have been by the mid- 2000 s a middle-income country instead of remaining the poorest country in Europe. Thus, there is a strong case for multilateral compensation. Moldova; Income; Human Development Costs; Poverty...|$|R

Chinese foreign direct investments (FDI) in the resource sector have soared since the mid- 2000 s in parallel to its increased dependency on overseas resources. As a result of booming resource markets, Africa, among other resource-rich regions, has benefitted from a surge in global FDI flows including from China. In this context, the African Union formalised its resource -based development and industrialisation strategy embodied in the African Mining Vision (2009). The initiative is supported by international and <b>bilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>agencies</b> but thus far has not echoed into China’s Africa policy discourses and cooperation frameworks.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} main {{challenges}} and opportunities for incorporating mixed method approaches into research and evaluation on the effectiveness and impacts of international development. It draws on the authors’ experience over several decades working in both academia and {{with a wide range}} of multilateral and <b>bilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>agencies,</b> non-profit organisations and developing country governments on the evaluation of the effectiveness and impacts of development interventions. Development research is informed by current research trends in Northern countries, but it is often conducted within very distinct economic, political, cultural and organisational contexts. While certainly not unique to the international context, many development evaluations are subject to a range of budget, time, data, political and organisational constraints that tend to be more severe than those faced by researchers working in industrialised nations. Moreover, due to the more limited opportunities to conduct research in developing countries, individual studies or evaluations are often required to address a broader set of questions. So while a researcher in the US may be able to focus exclusively on a rigorous summative evaluation designed to address a limited range of questions on quantitative impacts, the same researcher evaluating a major development intervention in Latin America, Africa or Asia may be asked to address a wider range of summative and formative questions. We argue that the demand for multi-purpose evaluations in developing countries opens up opportunities for a broader application of mixed method approaches than is usually the case in ‘mainstream’ mixed method research.

Active private sector participation {{has been an important}} factor driving change. Many agencies have been involved in this work. The authors find that their roles have been consistent with their comparative advantages. As to how the international community can best support continued progress, the authors conclude in favor of a cautious approach to the imposition of new WTO obligations in the area of trade facilitation. On the whole, this is the approach the WTO has taken, for example, by limiting its negotiations on trade facilitation to several specific provisions of the GATT. The WTO can continue to function as a catalyst for reform. It is perhaps uniquely placed to relate the trade facilitation agenda to the overall trade agenda. On design and construction of the relevant infrastructures and capacities to spur development, the <b>development</b> institutions, including <b>bilateral</b> <b>agencies,</b> should continue to lead. The authors find little evidence to support the need for a comprehensive new"platform"or mechanism to channel trade-related aid as part of implementation of any new agreement at the WTO on trade facilitation. They recommend, however, that an innovative approach to using the well established, but under utilized Trade Policy Review Mechanism be considered to increase transparency on where new aid is going over time and to expand understanding of where and how country-based progress has been achieved.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{contributes}} to the ongoing debate regarding extraterritorial human rights obligations with a specific focus on development cooperation. Various international human rights instruments enshrine the obligation to take steps through international assistance and cooperation towards the realisation of economic, social and cultural rights, yet the legal standing of the obligation remains contested, {{and a number of}} gaps remain as regards our understanding and application of the obligation. This study first considers the legal foundations of the obligation of international assistance and cooperation, reaffirming its existence as a legal duty, not just a moral one. With reference to the output of treaty bodies, reports of UN Special Procedures and relevant academic commentary, the various aspects the obligation are clarified and placed within the context of international development cooperation. Specific extraterritorial duties in relation to the rights to education and health are also. identified. In order to provide contextual description of the obligation and means of its implementation, examination and comparison of development activities of American and British <b>bilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>agencies</b> in Ghana is undertaken.

40|$|Human rights-based {{approaches}} (RBA) {{have become}} {{an important factor in}} international development policy, endorsed and adopted by leading non-governmental organizations working in <b>development</b> (<b>development</b> NGOs), <b>bilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>agencies,</b> and UN agencies such as UNICEF, UNDP, and WHO. This research assesses the significance of the RBA trend by examining the reasons for RBA adoption, NGOs' interpretation of the RBA, organizational changes after adoption, and implementation. The RBA is a conceptual framework with potentially radical and powerful implications for development practice. But this radical concept is found to lose much of its power as the new paradigm is transformed in practice through the interpretation of the RBA, organizational changes, and implementation. The full potential of RBA is diminished because NGOs interpret the RBA in ways that fit their organizational backgrounds and expertise. Three variants of the RBA are identified: popular, equity, and classical, emphasizing grassroots organizing, global advocacy, and international human rights standards, respectively. Organizational dynamics further limit the RBA's impact, as NGOs adopting the RBA have tended to manage change by modifying existing methods, rather than organizational transformation. Finally, the RBA is compromised in implementation at the country level. NGOs are found to have difficulty implementing strategies that change power relations, strengthen accountability, promote non-discrimination, and strengthen partnerships among NGOs. Six factors are found to affect the likelihood that an NGO will adopt a RBA: the percentage of annual revenue from governments, the number of NGO members in an international federation or family, the NGOs' host country, the NGO's association with other organizations, its working methods, and the issue areas in which it works. Leadership also plays important roles in adoption. The study is based on statistical analysis of the factors affecting RBA adoption in the thirty largest international development NGOs; analysis of NGOs' interpretation of the RBA and organizational change in three cases, ActionAid UK, Oxfam GB, and Save the Children Sweden; and a case study of implementation by the same three NGOs in Vietnam...|$|R

Economic activity has greatly increased since a United Nations-sponsored ceasefire agreement was signed with Morocco in 1991, which resulted in the demobilization of Polisario troops who moved into the camps and began to re-engage in livestock husbandry, seasonal nomadism and trade.|$|R
40|$|Poverty {{reduction}} {{is now a}} prime concern of global policy makers. Renewed global efforts for poverty reduction are presented as the Post-Washington Consensus. In this context, I identify an emerging Global Development Architecture that entails new patterns of inter-linkages between the WTO, IMF, World Bank, Regional <b>Development</b> Banks and <b>Bilateral</b> and Multilateral <b>Development</b> <b>Agencies.</b> Using the example of microcredit and poverty reduction I address the political economic implications of the emerging Global Development Architecture. I argue that microcredit (i) facilitates financial sector liberalisation and the global trade in financial services; (ii) functions as a political safety-net, containing or dampening resistance at the community level to liberalisation policies and economic austerity measures. Through a critical review of the Global Development Architecture the article reveals how global and local political economies are being linked via the poverty reduction agenda. Normative discourses underpinning the Post-Washington Consensus are argued to be instrumental to efforts to consolidate constitutionally what {{continues to be the}} Washington Consensus...|$|R
40|$|At the moment, {{a lack of}} {{integration}} and coordination characterizes {{the relationship between the}} agriculture and health sectors. Traditionally, agricultural and health policies address specific goals within those sectors. Agricultural policies address conservation of the natural resource base, protection of farmers' livelihoods, basic needs of the poor including food security, and the context for regulations on, among other things, food safety and the sound use of pesticides. National public health policies are also sectorally driven and reflect the dichotomy in the health sector between preventive action and curative care [...] . [A] conducive policy framework is essential for effective agriculture-health collaboration. This framework should be comprehensive, focus on strategic issues, be periodically reviewed and updated, and maintain criteria that recognize the bidirectional nature of the links. Not only are these policies important at the national level, but they should also be introduced at the level of international organizations and <b>bilateral</b> and multilateral <b>development</b> <b>agencies.</b> " From textLivelihoods, food security, Food safety, pesticides, Public health, Agriculture-health linkages,...|$|R
40|$|Both {{multilateral}} and <b>bilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>agencies</b> {{provide financial}} {{and technical assistance}} to developing countries, for development projects. However, aid effectiveness, {{the impact on the}} economy and the effect on institutional capacity is widely debated. The role of Project Management Units (PMUs) as an implementation mechanism is a key topic in these discussions, on effective delivery of development aid. The relationship between the PMU, a temporary organization, and the parent organization is critical to existing organizational capacity, efficient project implementation and the subsequent institutionalization of project outcomes. This issue has not been given sufficient attention in the literature on the subject of project based organizations, which does not attempt to evaluate the PMU's level of integration within the main organization, and the effect of this relationship on project implementation and institutional capacity and sustainability of project outcomes. This research a) explores the literature and develops a model to analyze the relationship between project management units and their parent organizations in terms of the level of integration, and b) analyzes the perception of Project Directors of donor-funded projects to asses the impact of this integration on efficient project implementation, institutionalization of project outcomes, and the capacity of the parent organization. The methodology includes a literature review on project organizations, project structure and international donor- funded projects and a semi-structured questionnaire survey administered to selected Project Directors. The research concludes that there are different degrees of integration of PMUs, of ongoing donor-funded projects, with the main organization. The differences in the integration arise from {{the way in which the}} PMU is structured and where it is located, recruitment of the Project Director and PMU staff internally or externally, and the extra benefits enjoyed by the PMU staff. It confirms that PMUs with low integration contribute to efficient project implementation because it gives the Project Director required autonomy in decision-making to overcome the bureaucracy of the government structures. However, it dilutes the existing institution's capacity as the PMU work substitutes the parent organization's work and there is a low level of interaction between parent organization and PMU staff. Also, low integrated PMUs create problems in institutionalizing project outcomes, as there are conflicting views on how the project is implemented. Research recommends further studies on this subject as disbursement figures contradict with Project Directors' perceptions of the implementation efficiency. Low integrated PMUs are reported to have low efficiency in terms of disbursements against the time elapsed for the loan period to that of a highly integrated PMU...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} beneficiary {{participation as}} a recent innovation {{in the evolution of}} international development assistance. International development assistance provided to less developed countries has its origins in the Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of post World War II Europe. The success of this aid led to its application, though the World Bank and other specialist international and <b>bilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>agencies,</b> directed at economic development rather than reconstruction. The results of adapting development approaches, to require participation of beneficiaries in planning and management, remain controversial, in terms of the additional time, costs, and development outcomes. Although the trend towards participation is gathering pace, even proponents do not agree precisely on the form of participation most appropriate to different situations. This research examines participation in agricultural development in Vietnam in the context of project preparation for a <b>development</b> <b>agency.</b> Two case studies were considered, in which a similar form of participation had been used in initial planning some two years apart, and had continued into implementation of the project in the earlier case. It compared both cases to determine variations in planning approaches and development outcomes that could have been associated with longer exposure to the participatory process in the first case. Although the initial planning ideas expressed by participants were similar in both cases, their ideas differed two and five years apart with iteration of the participatory planning process. It was found that the level of participation achieved in the initial planning was less significant in terms of Arnstein 's ladder than anticipated at the outset and this impacted on the plans made and their achievability over the plan period. Over the following five years, beneficiary participation evolved into a deeper level in the Arnstein (1969) sense when planning was allowed by the recipient Government authorities to result in action. This increasing confidence of beneficiaries, development agents and government officials, informed subsequent cycles of planning and positively impacted on the development outcome. The deeper level of participation was also associated with increased personal and group accountabilities and the increased availability of discretionary government budget for project activities. It was concluded that different perceptions of the purpose of the participation existed both within the external <b>development</b> <b>agency</b> and between it and the recipient Government staff and community leaders. These perceptions resulted from fundamental philosophical differences about the role of community participation in economic development. The research indicates that differing perceptions may be made more congruent and produce a more effective development outcome through use of participatory planning processes. It suggests that lengthy participatory planning in the absence of development action may not result in better development outcomes. In addition it corroborates other findings that projects having repeat phases {{are likely to be more}} effective than single phase projects. In terms of practical contribution to development planning the research suggests that it is worth initiating participatory planning processes early in the project cycle, during preparation, to introduce the concepts but the most effective participation is likely to occur during implementation when experience can inform the participatory planning process through participatory monitoring and evaluation. It further suggests that conditional commitment to subsequent phases of projects is desirable from the outset is good development outcomes are to be expected in complex situations such as is the case with opium growers in the hills of Vietnam.
