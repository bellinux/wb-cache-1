The campaign used nonviolent but intentionally confrontational tactics, developed in part by Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker. <b>Black</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Birmingham, organizing with the SCLC, occupied public spaces with marches and sit-ins, openly violating laws that they considered unjust.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Shepard, Ominsky, and Finnerty {{were all}} reelected to the legislature. The {{following}} year, {{he was appointed}} to a commission charged with drafting a new city charter for Philadelphia, but the resulting document {{was rejected by the}} voters at the polls that November. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1938, but in 1940 he ran again and was elected along with Finnerty and Samuel Rose. After that term ended, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Shepard recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C., a position he held until 1951. At that time, Shepard and Mary McLeod Bethune were the only two <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> government service in the nation's capital.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Australian arm of KFC {{was accused}} of racial {{insensitivity}} over a television commercial showing an outnumbered white cricket fan handing out pieces of fried chicken to appease a dancing, drumming and singing group of black West Indies supporters.

5|$|Wentworth Arthur Matthew {{founded the}} Commandment Keepers Congregation in Harlem in 1919. Matthew was {{influenced}} by the non-black Jews he met as well as by Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League. Garvey used the Biblical Jews in exile as a metaphor for <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> North America. One of the accomplishments of Garvey's movement was to strengthen the connection between black Americans and Africa, Ethiopia in particular. When Matthew later learned about the Beta Israel—Ethiopian Jews—he identified with them.|$|E
5|$|On June 4, 1972, the Dodgers retired {{his uniform}} number, 42, {{alongside}} those of Roy Campanella (39) and Sandy Koufax (32). From 1957 to 1964, Robinson was {{the vice president}} for personnel at Chock full o'Nuts; he was the first black person to serve as vice president of a major American corporation. Robinson always considered his business career as advancing the cause of <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> commerce and industry. Robinson also chaired the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's (NAACP) million-dollar Freedom Fund Drive in 1957, and served on the organization's board until 1967. In 1964, he helped found, with Harlem businessman Dunbar McLaurin, Freedom National Bank—a black-owned and operated commercial bank based in Harlem. He also served as the bank's first chairman of the board. In 1970, Robinson established the Jackie Robinson Construction Company to build housing for low-income families.|$|E
5|$|She {{used her}} access {{to form a}} {{coalition}} of leaders from black organizations called the Federal Council of Negro Affairs, but which {{came to be known}} as the Black Cabinet. It served as an advisory board to the Roosevelt administration on issues facing <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> America. It was composed of numerous talented blacks, mostly men, who had been appointed to positions in federal agencies. This was the first collective of black people working in higher positions in government. It suggested to voters that the Roosevelt administration cared about black concerns. The group gathered in Bethune's office or apartment and met informally, rarely keeping minutes. Although as advisers they did not directly create public policy, they were a respected leadership among black voters; they influenced political appointments and disbursement of funds to organizations that would benefit black people.|$|E

5|$|In February 1836 Edwards landed 170 <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Texas, taking {{advantage}} of the confusion surrounding the end of the Texas Revolution and the establishment of the independent Republic of Texas, which had not yet outlawed the importation of slaves. William Fisher, the customs collector on the Brazos River, wrote to the Texas Constitutional Convention that Edwards did not report the importation to the authorities, and Fisher went to Edwards' plantation to confront Edwards. Because of uncertainty about the legality of importing slaves, Fisher did not seize the slaves but referred the issue to the newly formed Texas Government after securing a monetary bond from Edwards. Although the new Texas Republic eventually outlawed the importation of slaves from anywhere but the United States, Edwards' landing of slaves from Cuba in early 1836 was never prosecuted. After this, Edwards also established a slave market on Galveston Bay, near present-day San Leon. In 1837, he was sued by Robert Peebles for fraud involving the sale of a slave with tuberculosis to Peebles. Peebles won the case.|$|E

25|$|Utah was {{the only}} western state or {{territory}} that had slaves in 1850, but slavery was never important economically in Utah, and there were fewer than 100 slaves in the territory.

When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Utah sided with the Union, and slavery ended in 1862 when the United States Congress abolished slavery in the Utah Territory.|$|E

25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of war, thousands of enslaved blacks gained freedom during the Revolution. Enslaved persons during these years found their freedom through military service, petitions for freedom, and manumissions by colonists who believed that “every man is created equal” and manumitted their slaves. By {{the end of the}} war, more than 5,000 enslaved African Americans had survived their military service with the Continental Army and joined the new America as free men, vastly increasing the number of free <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the newly formed states.|$|E
25|$|The {{internment}} camps already {{opened by}} the Third Republic were immediately put to new use, ultimately becoming transit camps {{for the implementation}} of the Holocaust and the extermination of all undesirables, including the Romani people (who refer to the extermination of the Romani as Porrajmos). A Vichy law of 4 October 1940 authorized internments of foreign Jews on the sole basis of a prefectoral order, and the first raids took place in May 1941. Vichy imposed no restrictions on <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the Unoccupied Zone; the regime even had a mulatto cabinet minister, the Martinique-born lawyer Henry Lémery.|$|E
25|$|Gordimer's early {{interest}} in racial and economic inequality in South Africa was shaped {{in part by}} her parents. Her father's experience as a refugee in tsarist Russia helped form Gordimer's political identity, but he was neither an activist nor particularly sympathetic toward the experiences of black people under apartheid. Conversely, Gordimer saw activism by her mother, whose concern about the poverty and discrimination faced by <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> South Africa ostensibly led her to found a crèche for black children. Gordimer also witnessed government repression first-hand as a teenager; the police raided her family home, confiscating letters and diaries from a servant's room.|$|E
