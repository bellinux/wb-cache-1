5|$|The {{wetlands}} at {{the headwaters}} of Spring Brook are home to boreal forest trees. These include <b>black</b> <b>spruce,</b> paper birch, and tamarack. Huckleberry, lady's slipper, leather leaf, mountain laurel, pitcher plant, and rhododendron plants inhabit bogs in the area.|$|E
5|$|Coniferous trees such as <b>black</b> <b>spruce,</b> white spruce, and {{balsam fir}} {{dominate}} the native vegetation. The largest deciduous tree is white birch; species of lesser stature include alder, cherry and mountain ash. Of introduced tree species, sycamore maple is most abundant and Norway maple is common. Blue spruce, common horsechestnut, European beech and littleleaf linden {{are among the}} other non-native species grown.|$|E
5|$|Forests make {{up about}} , or 48 percent, of the province's land area. The forests consist of pines (Jack Pine, Red Pine, Eastern White Pine), spruces (White Spruce, <b>Black</b> <b>Spruce),</b> Balsam Fir, Tamarack (larch), poplars (Trembling Aspen, Balsam Poplar), birches (White Birch, Swamp Birch) and small pockets of Eastern White Cedar.|$|E

50|$|The {{boreal forest}} zone {{consists}} of closed-crown conifer forests with a conspicuous deciduous element (Ritchie 1987). The {{proportions of the}} dominant conifers (white and <b>black</b> <b>spruces,</b> jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), tamarack, and balsam fir) vary greatly in response to interactions among climate, topography, soil, fire, pests, and perhaps other factors.|$|R

5|$|When {{exploiting}} distant {{food sources}} found in clearings, grey jays were observed temporarily concentrating their caches in an arboreal site {{along the edge}} of a <b>black</b> <b>spruce</b> forest in interior Alaska. This allowed a high rate of caching in the short term and reduced the jay's risk of predation. A subsequent recaching stage occurred, and food items were transferred to widely scattered sites to reduce theft.|$|E
5|$|Boreal {{forest trees}} such as <b>black</b> <b>spruce,</b> paper birch, and {{tamarack}} inhabit wetlands in the watershed of Roaring Brook. Plants such as mountain laurel, leather leaf, pitcher plant, rhododendron, huckleberry, and lady's slipper inhabit bogs in these wetlands. Old-growth forests containing oak, pine, and hemlock trees are {{also present in}} the Nay Aug Gorge. Upstream of Ridge Row, the stream's riparian buffer is wooded with some rock outcrops. Upstream of Nay Aug, the riparian canopy is mostly intact. Some hemlock trees in the Nay Aug Gorge {{have been affected by}} hemlock wooly adelgid.|$|E
5|$|Ascocoryne sarcoides is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Helotiaceae. The species name {{is derived from the}} Greek sarkodes (fleshy). Formerly known as Coryne sarcoides, its taxonomical history has been {{complicated}} by the fact that it may adopt both sexual and asexual forms. Colloquially known as jelly drops or the purple jellydisc, this common fungus appears as a gelatinous mass of pinkish or purple-colored discs. Distributed widely in North America, Europe and Asia, A.sarcoides is a saprobic fungus and grows in clusters on the trunks and branches of a variety of dead woods. Field studies suggest that colonization by A.sarcoides of the heartwood of <b>black</b> <b>spruce</b> confers some resistance to further infection by rot-causing fungi. A.sarcoides contains the antibiotic compound ascocorynin, shown in the laboratory to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
50|$|In the Prairie Provinces, the spruce cone maggot (Delia anthracina Czerny), which Rose and Lindquist {{designated}} as Hylemya anthracina (Czerny), attacks cones of white, Engelmann, and <b>black</b> <b>spruces,</b> {{and in some}} years may destroy the entire seed crop. The spruce cone-axis midge (Dasineura rachiphaga) and cone maggots (Pegohylemia) were also found to be damaging white spruce cones and seed near Fairbanks.|$|R
50|$|Lodgepole pine is {{the most}} common {{associate}} of interior spruce in the SBS. Subalpine fir is abundant in cooler, moister subzones. Trembling aspen and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) are often found with spruce on warmer, drier, more southerly subzones. Black cottonwood is the main associate of interior spruce on active floodplain sites, and mixtures of white and <b>black</b> <b>spruces</b> are common on wetlands.|$|R
50|$|Pokemouche {{is located}} in the east {{lowlands}} ecoregion, more precisely in the Caraquet ecodistrict. The long history of colonisation and disruption of the forest led to the prevalence of red maple, white poplar and gray birch. The hollows of the valleys and areas of coarse soil are covered with <b>black</b> <b>spruces</b> and jack pines, which is evidence of a high frequency of fires. There is also hemlock, cedar and tamarack larch growing in some places.|$|R
5|$|Southern Labrador {{is mostly}} taiga. It is {{characterized}} by low winter temperatures, a longer growing season, and more precipitation than the tundra. Soils are typically lacking important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The taiga is dominated by coniferous trees, notably balsam fir and <b>black</b> <b>spruce,</b> though the deciduous white birch, trembling aspen and mountain ash are also present. The most common animals are the moose, American black bear, Canada lynx, red fox, pine marten, short-tailed weasel, and American mink. Beavers, muskrats, and river otters thrive in the many rivers, streams, and wetlands. Willow ptarmigan, common raven, and blackpoll warbler inhabit the forests of southern Labrador while golden eagles, rough-legged hawks and peregrine falcons nest on steep cliffs.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of grey jays live {{where there is a}} strong presence of <b>black</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea mariana), white spruce (P. glauca), Engelmann spruce (P. engelmanni), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), or lodgepole pine (P. contorta). Grey jays do not inhabit the snowy, coniferous, and therefore seemingly appropriate Sierra Nevada of California where no spruce occur. Nor do grey jays live in lower elevations of coastal Alaska or British Columbia dominated by Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). The key habitat requirements may be sufficiently cold temperatures to ensure successful storage of perishable food and tree bark with sufficiently pliable scales arranged in a shingle-like configuration that allows grey jays to wedge food items easily up into dry, concealed storage locations. Storage may also be assisted by the antibacterial properties of the bark and foliage of boreal tree species. An exception to this general picture may be the well-marked subspecies P. c. obscurus. It lives right down to the coast from Washington to northern California in the absence of cold temperatures or the putatively necessary tree species.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} field studies {{conducted}} in the boreal forest region of Northern Ontario (Canada) showed that A.sarcoides {{was found to be}} frequently associated with various deciduous and coniferous tree hosts that had been affected by the fungal disease known as heart rot; this discovery was noted as unusual, as most fungal tree infections are known to be caused by Basidiomycetes, not Ascomycetes. In the case of the commercially valuable tree species <b>black</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea mariana), it was determined that prior colonization by A.sarcoides reduces the incidence of subsequent infection by common fungal pathogens, such as Fomes pini and Scytinostroma galactina; furthermore, A.sarcoides can exist in the wood with no noticeable harmful effects on the host. A similar relationship was shown later to exist with jack pine trees (species Pinus banksiana), whereby A.sarcoides inhibited Peniophora pseudopini, but had little effect on the subsequent growth of Fomes pini. The study also showed that A.sarcoides is isolated more frequently from defective wood as the age of the tree increases (trees examined in the study were over 80 years old), and that it can infect both uninfected heartwood as well as previously decayed wood; in the latter case it usually coexists with the causal fungi.|$|E
40|$|While old {{trees have}} long been of interest, their {{significant}} role in responding to climate change at northern tree lines has been overlooked. Long-lived <b>black</b> <b>spruces</b> at the tree line in Labrador show a radial growth response that is synchronous with recent climate warming. The ability of individuals to persist with suppressed radial growth rates during adverse growing conditions may have significant implications for {{the rate at which}} these trees are able to respond when conditions become favourable...|$|R

25|$|Boreal {{forests of}} the {{southern}} part of the province have extensive <b>black</b> <b>spruce</b> and white spruce forests. The tundra region of northern Manitoba exhibits more sparse <b>black</b> <b>spruce</b> forests whose tree heights are limited by the thin soils, permafrost underlayer and generally cold climate. In this region polar bears are found, denning in the Wapusk National Park and migrating to hunt for seals when pack ice forms on Hudson Bay.|$|E
25|$|Named for its open marshy grassland, the park's peat bogs and marshes include sedges and <b>black</b> <b>spruce,</b> tamarack, {{and white}} cedar. Uplands host a mixed {{hardwood}} and conifer forest of maple, oak, poplar, birch, white pine, and red pine.|$|E
25|$|The {{mixedwood}} forest wetlands consist {{mainly of}} bogs, fens and marshes. <b>Black</b> <b>spruce,</b> tamarack, willow and bog and sphagnum mosses {{are the major}} vegetation types found in these lowlands. Dwarf birch and sedges cover large, wet areas with jack pine occurring on the sandy ridges.|$|E

50|$|The forest {{contains}} about 30 species of woody plants, labeled and planted in a park-like setting, including Scots Pine, Ponderosa Pine, Siberian Larch, <b>Black</b> Hills <b>Spruce,</b> Elaeagnus, and Rocky Mountain Juniper. Wildlife includes deer, wild turkeys, porcupines, elk, and sometimes moose. The forest is also popular with birdwatchers.|$|R
25|$|Some of {{the plant}} species found are Arctic <b>black</b> <b>spruce,</b> Arctic willow, cottongrass, crustose lichens, kobresia, moss species, wood rush, wire rush, purple saxifrage, Dryas species, sedges, Diapensia lapponica, Arctic poppy, {{mountain}} avens, mountain sorrel, river beauty, moss campion, bilberry, and Arctic white heather.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the 14 <b>black</b> <b>spruce</b> trees {{located in}} the batter's eye were removed, {{following}} hitters' complaints that the trees interfered {{with the ability to}} see pitches as they would sometimes sway in the wind. The batter's eye wall itself was covered in a black material designed to reduce glare.|$|E
25|$|<b>Black</b> <b>spruce,</b> jack pine, {{trembling}} aspen, white birch, white spruce, balsam poplar, and {{balsam fir}} are the dominant {{trees in the}} area. A prominent forest form {{in this part of}} the <b>black</b> <b>spruce</b> distribution is the black spruce/feathermoss climax forest, which characteristically exhibits moderately dense canopy and features a forest floor of feathermosses. Moose, beaver, muskrat, snowshoe hare, as well as numerous predators roam this area, including marten, ermine, fisher, otter, black bear, wolf, and lynx. The many wetlands and lakes support a diversity of bird species, such as great blue herons, ducks, geese, and that symbol of the north, the common loon. Ground and tree dwelling birds are also plentiful, including grouse, partridge, robins, blue jays, and gray jays as well as birds of prey such as hawks.|$|E
60|$|Mara {{had often}} rambled for whole solitary days in this lonely wood, and knew all its rocks and dells the whole three {{miles to the}} long bridge {{at the other end}} of the island. But she had never before seen it under the solemn stillness of midnight moonlight, which gives to the most {{familiar}} objects such a strange, ghostly charm. After they had gone a mile into the forest, she could see through the <b>black</b> <b>spruces</b> silver gleams of the sea, and hear, amid the whirr and sway of the pine-tops, the dash of the ever restless tide which pushed up the long cove. It was at the full, as she could discern with a rapid glance of her practiced eye, expertly versed in the knowledge of every change of the solitary nature around.|$|R
25|$|Picea glauca, {{the white}} spruce, is {{a species of}} spruce native to the {{northern}} temperate and boreal forests in North America. Picea glauca was originally native from central Alaska all through the east, across southern/central Canada to the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland. It now has become naturalized southward into the far northern United States border states like Montana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine; {{there is also an}} isolated population in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming. It is also known as Canadian spruce, skunk <b>spruce,</b> cat <b>spruce,</b> <b>Black</b> Hills <b>spruce,</b> western white spruce, Alberta white spruce, and Porsild spruce.|$|R
50|$|Conifers can include: Jack pines (Pinus banksiana); <b>Black</b> and White <b>spruces</b> (Picea mariana and Picea glauca); Balsam firs (Abies balsamea), and EasternRed junipers (Juniperus virginiana).|$|R
25|$|The arctic or {{northern}} timberline in North America forms a broad {{transition zone}} from Labrador to northern Alaska. In Labrador, white spruce is not abundant and constitutes less than 5% of the forest, {{with a range}} that coincides very closely with that of <b>black</b> <b>spruce</b> but extending slightly further north (Wilton 1964).|$|E
25|$|Tree species {{native to}} Whitchurch–Stouffville include: American Mountain Ash, Balsam Fir, Bitternut Hickory, Black Cherry, <b>Black</b> <b>Spruce,</b> Bur Oak, Eastern Hemlock, Eastern White Cedar, Peachleaf Willow, Pin Cherry, Red Oak, Red Maple, Red Pine, Shagbark Hickory, Silver Maple, Sugar Maple, Tamarack, Trembling Aspen, White Birch, White Oak, White Pine and White Spruce. In 2012, Whitchurch–Stouffville's forest cover was 28.9%.|$|E
25|$|Nearly 60 {{percent of}} the park is covered with {{northern}} hardwood forest. Above 2600 feet (790 m) conditions are too poor for hardwoods to thrive, and these trees become mixed with or replaced by balsam fir and red spruce. Above 3500 feet (1000 m) <b>black</b> <b>spruce</b> replace red. Higher still only trees short enough to be covered in snow during the winter can survive.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{of cooling}} {{has been shown to}} {{influence}} the frost resistance of tissues, but the actual rate of freezing will depend not only on the cooling rate, but also on the degree of supercooling and the properties of the tissue. Sakai (1979a) demonstrated ice segregation in shoot primordia of Alaskan white and <b>black</b> <b>spruces</b> when cooled slowly to 30nbsp&°C to -40nbsp&°C. These freeze-dehydrated buds survived immersion in liquid nitrogen when slowly rewarmed. Floral primordia responded similarly. Extraorgan freezing in the primordia accounts for the ability of the hardiest of the boreal conifers to survive winters in regions when air temperatures often fall to -50nbsp&°C or lower. The hardiness of the winter buds of such conifers is enhanced by the smallness of the buds, by the evolution of faster translocation of water, and an ability to tolerate intensive freeze dehydration. In boreal species of Picea and Pinus, the frost resistance of 1-year-old seedlings is on a par with mature plants, given similar states of dormancy.|$|R
50|$|Forests cover about 80.2% of {{the park}} area, or 17,461 hectares. Varieties of beech {{constitute}} the largest portion of the forest, at 65%. Other deciduous trees include oaks, water locust, birch hornbeam, linden, elm, acacia, aspen, maple, ash, wild cherry, holly, rowan, birch and others. Coniferous trees found in the park include white and <b>black</b> pine, <b>spruce,</b> fir, white fir and others. Gymnosperm plants covers about 0.6 ha.|$|R
