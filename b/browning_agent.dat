30|$|While the {{metabolic}} benefits of browning in humans {{remain to be}} fully established, safety is a concern that must first be addressed regarding any method used to induce browning. Cold exposure is a classic and efficient way to induce browning, but its obvious discomfort, together with risks of hypothermia, makes it impractical for clinical use. Therefore, <b>browning</b> <b>agents,</b> either endogenous or exogenous, provide an attractive alternative for improving metabolic diseases. Here we discuss a few commonly used <b>browning</b> <b>agents</b> {{to draw attention to}} the safety concern of inducing WAT browning.|$|R
40|$|Igniting {{thermogenesis}} within white {{adipose tissue}} (i. e., promoting expression and {{activity of the}} uncoupling protein UCP 1) has attracted much interest. Numerous “browning agents” have now been described (gene ablations, transgenes, food components, drugs, environments, etc.). The implied action of <b>browning</b> <b>agents</b> is that they increase UCP 1, through this heat production, leading to slimming. Here, we particularly point {{to the possibility that}} cause and effect may on occasion be the reverse: <b>browning</b> <b>agents</b> may disrupt, for example, the fur, leading to increased heat loss, increased thermogenic demand to counteract this heat loss, and thus, through sympathetic nervous system activation, to enhanced UCP 1 expression in white (and brown) adipose tissues...|$|R
30|$|The {{induction}} of brown-like adipocyte {{development in}} white adipose tissue (WAT) confers numerous metabolic benefits by decreasing adiposity and increasing energy expenditure. Therefore, WAT browning has gained considerable attention for {{its potential to}} reverse obesity and its associated co-morbidities. However, this perspective has been tainted by recent studies identifying the detrimental effects of inducing WAT browning. This review aims to highlight the adverse outcomes of both overactive and underactive browning activity, the harmful side effects of <b>browning</b> <b>agents,</b> {{as well as the}} molecular brake-switch system that has been proposed to regulate this process. Developing novel strategies that both sustain the metabolic improvements of WAT browning and attenuate the related adverse side effects is therefore essential for unlocking the therapeutic potential of <b>browning</b> <b>agents</b> in the treatment of metabolic diseases.|$|R
30|$|One {{significant}} limitation {{to the use}} of FGF 21 as a <b>browning</b> <b>agent</b> is {{the occurrence}} of severe bone loss. Wei et al. demonstrated that genetic Fgf 21 gain-of-function, as well as pharmacological FGF 21 treatment, in diet-induced obese mice reduced the number and area of osteoblasts and osteoclasts while increasing that of bone marrow adipocytes (Wei et al. 2012). In addition, chronic exposure to FGF 21 has been linked to growth retardation in mice based on the development of growth hormone (GH) resistance in Fgf 21 -transgenic mice (Inagaki et al. 2008). Overexpression of Fgf 21 has also been shown to cause infertility in female but not in male mice (Inagaki et al. 2007). Moreover, FGF 21 reduces physical activity and promotes torpor in Fgf 21 transgenic mice: a favorable adaptive response to starvation, but an undesirable outcome in the context of obesity (Inagaki et al. 2007). Hence, despite the beneficial effects of FGF 21 in terms of improving insulin resistance and inducing browning, its severe side effects will have to be overcome for long-term clinical administration.|$|E
30|$|VEGF-A is {{the master}} angiogenic factor and has been {{demonstrated}} to regulate the expansion and homeostasis of fat tissue (Sun et al. 2012; Elias et al. 2012; Lu et al. 2012; Sung et al. 2013). Using an inducible adipocyte-specific VEGF-A overexpression model, Sun et al. demonstrated that the local up-regulation of VEGF-A in adipocytes improved vascularization {{and led to the}} browning of WAT, with massive up-regulation of UCP 1 and PGC- 1 α (Sun et al. 2012). This was accompanied by an increase in energy expenditure and resistance to high fat diet-mediated metabolic dysfunction (Sun et al. 2012). On the contrary, loss of VEGF-A in adipose tissue elicits browning of WAT (Lu et al. 2012). However, the consequences of the proangiogenic activity of VEGF-A may not always be beneficial. During adipose tissue expansion, VEGF-A evidently serves a protective role for the metabolically challenged adipose tissue by facilitating browning. In contrast, under conditions of preexisting adipose tissue dysfunction, the stimulation of angiogenesis and fat pad expansion would likely have the opposite—and therefore detrimental effect. For instance, anti-VEGF-A therapies have been applied to treat cancer and eye diseases (Ferrara and Adamis 2016). Thus, the nature of its proangiogenic properties and the related tumorigenic potential impedes the utilization of VEGF-A as a therapeutic <b>browning</b> <b>agent</b> in obesity and diabetes treatment.|$|E

40|$|Objective of this {{research}} is to find and explain how chemical prevents enzymatic browning to occur. There are three stages in the experiment for {{this research}}, first is obtain the oil palm sap and let it react with air and observe the changes of the color of oil palm sap. Second stage is obtain the oil palm sap sample and test it with selected chemical which is Ascobic Acid (AA), Citric Acid (CA), L-cystien (LC), Sodium Chlorite (SC) and Catechol (CAT). The last stages {{of this research}} is analysis the oil palm sap, observation in color changes of the sap for 12 hour and 24 hour, measures absorbance from the UV range of the oil palm sap and using FTIR. Since browning reaction initiated by the enzymatic oxidation of Monophenol to 0 -Diphenol than Quinines, non enzymatic browning polymerization of Quinines lead to the formation of the pigmen that cause change in color of the sap. Result of the first stages of the experiment show the enzymatic browning occurs to oil palm sap with change of color of sap within 24 hour. For second stage of the experiment show AA, CA and LC show the positive result which the lowest concentration of selected chemical give change of sap color and high concentration of selected chemical does not change the original color of the sap after 24 hour. CAT and SC show the negative result which the highest concentration of CAT changes the sap color darker and highest concentration of SC change the actual sap color to another color. Result from the analysis using FTIR and Uv- Vis analysis show there are possibility all of the sample have phenolic compound that can cause the enzymatic browning. When comparing result with control measure of FTIR with FTIR of the inhibitor, result of ascorbic acid is most preferable to be inhibition of <b>browning</b> <b>agent</b> for oil palm sap...|$|E
40|$|Stabilization of mango slices (var. Arka anmol) in pre-cut {{form was}} {{achieved}} by using additive based minimal processing and modified atmosphere storage. The pre-treatments included use of firming agents {{in the form of}} calcium salt (1 %), antimicrobials such as benzoate and sorbate (0. 045 %), ascorbic acid as anti <b>browning</b> <b>agent</b> (0. 02 %), mild acidification (0. 4 % citric acid) and UV conditioning (2. 5 kJ m - 2). The pre-treated mango slices were subjected to different Modified Atmospheric (MA) conditions i. e., active with gas mixture flushing (4 % O 2 + 6 % CO 2 + 90 % N 2) in polythene pouches; passive MA with air in polythene pouches; passive MA in PET bottles with silicone membrane window (2. 25 cm 2) and passive MA in plastic trays, over wrapped with cling film. The pre-treated produce was also subjected to storage under controlled atmosphere (CA) in a continuous gas mixture flushing system (3 % O 2 + 8 % CO 2 + 89 % N 2) at 8 ± 1 °C. The pre-treated samples in combination with MAP or CA showed significant (p<= 0. 05) physical, physiological and microbiological stability in terms of respiratory drift without anaerobiosis and retention of ascorbic acid as well as carotenoids. The kinetic model for L, a, b colour coordinates and shear strength followed first order linear model during storage of the product at low temperature (8 ± 1 °C) with high correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 824 to 0. 987 and 0. 942 to 0. 993 for tristimulus colour and shear force values, respectively. Microbial safety was also ascertained in terms of SPC, Coliforms, yeast and molds during storage. Shelf life of 14 - 46 days was obtained for pre-treated mango slices stored in the MA/CA at 8 ± 1 °C. The control samples without pre-treatment kept under similar storage conditions showed restricted shelf life (8 - 12 days) at 8 ± 1 °C. The study highlights synergistic effect of physical conditioning in combination with additives based minimal processing and MA/CA storage conditions to give longer shelf life and suitability of the mango variety for minimal processing and MA/CA storage in pre-cut form...|$|E

30|$|In {{recently}} years, {{significant progress}} has been made in identifying stimuli and signaling pathways that can induce browning of WAT and trigger adaptive thermogenesis. These advancements in knowledge have garnered great support in exploiting adipose tissue plasticity together with <b>browning</b> <b>agents</b> as therapeutic tools for obesity, albeit with side effects as discussed above. The revelation of the two sides of the coin regarding the browning of WAT—namely, that it mitigates the metabolic consequences of obesity but propagates a hypermetabolic state in other pathologic conditions—suggests that browning “wastes energy” and thus is not a favorable physiological state. Therefore, we hypothesized that the body needs to tightly regulate this browning process via a “brake-switch” system to prevent the negative outcomes of both hyper- and hypo-activation of browning activity (Ferrannini et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{functional}} {{conversion of}} white adipose tissue (WAT) into a tissue with brown adipose tissue (BAT) -like activity, {{often referred to}} as “browning,” represents an intriguing strategy for combating obesity and metabolic disease. We demonstrate that thyroid hormone receptor (TR) activation by a synthetic agonist markedly induces a program of adaptive thermogenesis in subcutaneous WAT that coincides with a restoration of cold tolerance to cold-intolerant mice. Distinct from most other <b>browning</b> <b>agents,</b> pharmacological TR activation dissociates the browning of WAT from activation of classical BAT. TR agonism also induces the browning of white adipocytes in vitro, indicating that TR-mediated browning is cell autonomous. These data establish TR agonists as a class of browning agents, implicate the TRs in the browning of WAT, and suggest a profound pharmacological potential of this action...|$|R

30|$|Thyroid hormones (THs) T 4 (thyroxine) and T 3 (triiodothyronine) are key {{regulators}} of {{metabolism and}} energy homeostasis, {{and have been}} shown to induce WAT browning (Mullur et al. 2014). Low doses of the T 3 metabolite, triiodothyracetic acid (TRIAC), induced ectopic expression of UCP 1 in rat abdominal WAT (Medina-Gomez et al. 2008). Consistently, chronic administration of GC- 1, a thyroid hormone receptor β-specific agonist, to obese mice markedly increased browning of subcutaneous WAT with a significant increase in core body temperature and whole body energy expenditure (Lin et al. 2015). Similar safety concerns for the use of β 3 -AR agonists have been raised for THs in terms of heart risks, hyperthermia, and weight loss (Moolman 2002; Mullur et al. 2014). THs have also been linked to an increased risk of fractures in postmenopausal women with lower serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (Bauer et al. 2001), which directly affects bone turnover (Murphy and Williams 2004). This further emphasizes the need for <b>browning</b> <b>agents</b> to be carefully designed and controlled in order to ensure its safe metabolic benefits.|$|R
