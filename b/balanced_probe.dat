40|$|AbstractLaser-ultrasonics is an {{attractive}} and powerful tool for the non-destructive testing and evaluation (NDT&E) of composite materials. Current systems for non-contact detection of ultrasound have relatively low sensitivity compared to contact peizotransducers. They are also expensive, difficult to adjust, and strongly influenced by environmental noise. Moreover, laser-ultrasound (LU) systems typically launch only about 50 firings per second, much slower than the kHz level pulse repetition rate of conventional systems. As demonstrated here, most of these drawbacks can be eliminated by combining {{a new generation of}} compact, inexpensive, high repetition rate nanosecond fiber lasers with new developments in fiber telecommunication optics and an optimally designed <b>balanced</b> <b>probe</b> beam detector. In particular, a modified fiber-optic balanced Sagnac interferometer is presented as part of a LU pump–probe system for NDT&E of aircraft composites.

The probes required for profiling, however, can cause an unacceptable performance overhead for users. In previous work {{we have shown}} that significant overhead reduction can be achieved, with limited information loss, through the distribution of probes across deployed instances. However, existing strategies for probe distribution do not account for several relevant factors: acceptable overheads may vary, the distributions to be deployed may be limited, profiled events may have different likelihoods, and the user pool composition may be unknown. This paper evaluates strategies for probe distribution while manipulating these factors through an empirical study. Our findings indicate that for tight overhead bounds: 1) deploying numerous versions with complementary probe distributions can compensate for the reduction of probes per deployed instance, and 2) techniques that <b>balance</b> <b>probe</b> allocation, consider groupings and prior-allocations, can generate distributions that retain significantly more field information...|$|R

40|$|For {{designing}} oligonucleotide tiling arrays popular, current methods still rely on simple criteria like Hamming distance or longest common factors, neglecting base stacking effects which strongly {{contribute to}} binding energies. Consequently, probes are often prone to cross-hybridization which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio and complicates downstream analysis. We propose the first computationally efficient method using hybridization energy to identify specific oligonucleotide probes. Our Cross-Hybridization Potential (CHP) is computed with a Nearest Neighbor Alignment, which efficiently estimates a lower {{bound for the}} Gibbs free energy of the duplex formed by two DNA sequences of bounded length. It is derived from our simplified reformulation of t-gap insertion-deletion-like metrics. The computations are accelerated by a filter using weighted ungapped q-grams to arrive at seeds. The computation of the CHP is implemented in our software OSProbes, available under the GPL, which computes sets of viable probe candidates. The user can choose a trade-off between running time and quality of probes selected. We obtain very favorable results in comparison with prior approaches with respect to specificity and sensitivity for cross-hybridization and genome coverage with high-specificity probes.

Although the effects of water stresses on the cropdevelopment are known, few reliable methodologies used for its characterizations basedon parameters directly related to the plants exist, aiming to maintain good productivitylevels and to increase the tolerance to water deficiency, mainly due to the difficulties ofenvironmental control of water factor. Based on this focus, the objective of this workwas to characterize the water stress of two maize (Zea mays L.) inbred lines by means ofautomatic sap flow (F) measurements with energy <b>balance</b> <b>probes,</b> installed on segmentsof plants stems. The probes are composed of heating electric resistance (thermal jacket) and registering sensors of heat and temperature flow. The thermal jacket supplied aconstant rate of heat to the stem segment. Thermocouples of copper-constantan wereused as sensors to detect the losses of heat from the thermal jacket to the air surroundingthe stem and the temperature differences in the stem segment studied. The automaticacquisition data system involved a datalogger, sensors, a portable computer, a solar paneland rechargeable batteries. A program was used for readings in the probes sensors andcalculations of the sap flow rates. An equation, expressing the plants water stress index(PWSI) and involving terms of the measured F rates under two water regime conditions(non stressed and stressed), was used in the water stress characterization. The resultsindicated that the probes were sensible to detect variation of sap flow and the PWSI wasan appropriate methodology for water stress characterization of the two maize inbredlines investigated; the total leaf area of the two studied inbred lines was reduced by thewater stress condition; the maize inbred line L 1170 presented smaller values of sap flowand was more sensible (larger values) to the PWSI studied, the maize inbred line L 13. 1. 2 presented larger values of sap flow and was more tolerant to PWSI (smaller values) ...|$|R

High sensitivity is achieved by using a torsion balance that has a long torsional period, strong magnetic damping of all vibrational motions and a feedback system that employs an optical lever. In torsion balance experiments, the distance fluctuations during measurements and the accuracy to which the absolute distance is determined are crucial for determining {{the sensitivity of the}} balance to a macroscopic force in the sub-micrometre range. We have estimated the root mean square amplitude of the distance fluctuation to be 18 nm by considering the effects due to seismic motions, tilt motions, residual angular fluctuations and thermal fluctuations.

In this study, a novel splice array approach was developed, including the design of a high-density oligonucleotide array, a labeling procedure, and an algorithm to identify splice events. Results The array consisted of exon <b>probes</b> and thermodynamically <b>balanced</b> junction <b>probes.</b> Suboptimal probes were tagged and considered in the final analysis. An unbiased labeling protocol was developed using random primers. The algorithm used to distinguish changes in expression from changes in splicing was calibrated using internal non-spliced control sequences. The performance of this splice array was validated with artificial constructs for CDC 6, VEGF, and PCBP 4 isoforms. The platform was then applied to the analysis of differential splice forms in lung cancer samples compared to matched normal lung tissue. Overexpression of splice isoforms was identified for genes encoding CEACAM 1, FHL- 1, MLPH, and SUSD 2. None of these splicing isoforms had been previously associated with lung cancer.

The transport was characterized by means of apparent convection-dispersion parameters that were derived from breakthrough curves (BTCs) at different lateral scales: the ERT voxel scale, the sampling volume of TDR, and the cross-section of the column. We validated the ERT-derived data by means of mass <b>balance,</b> TDR <b>probes,</b> and the effluent BTC. We observed an excellent mass recovery by ERT. The ERT-derived transport velocities exhibited minimal bias and high precision at {{the scale of the}} TDR measurements. On average the ERT-derived column-scale transport velocities were also not biased; however, the spatial variability of the voxel-scale velocities within the column's cross-sections underestimated the true velocity variability. In contrast to the transport velocities, the ERT-derived dispersivities exhibited a large bias and low precision and were sensitive to temporal smoothing. Unlike previous studies, we did not find evidence that the ERT-derived voxel-scale dispersivities increase with decreasing ERT sensitivity. Although ERT provided unprecedented information about transport processes, resolution and uncertainty analyses remain important issues requiring further investigation. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe inland, mountainous {{marginal}} areas (land abandoned by farming and colonised by shrubs) of the Iberian Peninsular, Spain, generally receive a higher rainfall than the coastal areas (Lazaro and Rey, 1991) and may store water after cold season (autumn and winter) rainfall. By measuring runoff, change of soil water content and rainfall, this study tests {{the hypothesis that}} two shrubs on two sites on abandoned land do not use all the water available after cold season rainfall. One site was on an upper alluvial slope dominated by Anthyllis cytisoides {{and the other on}} a lower alluvial slope dominated by Retama sphaerocarpa. The root systems of A. cytisoides and R. sphaerocarpa penetrate to 3 m and 20 m, respectively. A. cytisoides senesces during the dry season and R. sphaerocarpa is evergreen. The water balance is dominated by high actual evapotranspiration (ET), which is limited by rainfall. Reference evapotranspiration was high; runoff was low and soil water storage occurred above 2 m depth. ET and water storage were highest under A. cytisoides shrubs. Runoff was lower on the ?Anthyllis' site. The spatial variability of soil water is high and the problems of its measurement are discussed. The quantity of rainfall infiltrated was greater under shrubs than grass-areas, suggesting that shrub roots facilitated preferential flow. The growing season of A. cytisoides began when water was available in the upper soil layers and senescence occurred when the upper soil layers dried to less than 4 % water content. A. cytisoides, therefore, relies on water from these layers. The main growth of R. sphaerocarpa occurred when the upper soil layers were relatively dry, so that R. sphaerocarpa must extract water from deeper layers. Results suggest that A. cytisoides accumulates rainfall and runoff and directs water to lower layers for later use, while R. sphaerocarpa extracts water from deeper soil layers. By mid-summer both shrubs had extracted all the available water accumulated in the upper soil layers from cold season rainfall.

40|$|Hashing is {{fundamental}} to many algorithms and data structures widely used in practice. For theoretical analysis of hashing, {{there have been two}} main approaches. First, one can assume that the hash function is truly random, mapping each data item independently and uniformly to the range. This idealized model is unrealistic because a truly random hash function requires an exponential number of bits to describe. Alternatively, one can provide rigorous bounds on performance when explicit families of hash functions are used, such as 2 -universal or O(1) -wise independent families. For such families, performance guarantees are often noticeably weaker than for ideal hashing. In practice, however, it is commonly observed that simple hash functions, including 2 -universal hash functions, perform as predicted by the idealized analysis for truly random hash functions. In this paper, we try to explain this phenomenon. We demonstrate that the strong performance of universal hash functions in practice can arise naturally from a combination of the randomness of the hash function and the data. Specifically, following the large body of literature on random sources and randomness extraction, we model the data as coming from a “block source, ” whereby each new data item has some “entropy ” given the previous ones. As long as the (Renyi) entropy per data item is sufficiently large, {{it turns out that the}} performance when choosing a hash function from a 2 -universal family is essentially the same as for a truly random hash function.

The amelioration of salinized land {{must be based}} on large amount of water content and salinity data. Plastic coated TDR has been designed to measure water content accurately in highly saline soil, but the soil bulk electrical conductivity cannot be measured due to the coated materials. In order to measure the volumetric water content and bulk electrical conductivity in highly saline soils at the same time, a parallel three-wire TDR probe with central rod coated which was used to measure water content and a triangle three-wire TDR probe which was used to measure electrical conductivity were integrated in one probe with four rods and one slide switch. Materials and methods: The influence of angle in triangle three-wire TDR probe and the non-working rod on water content or electrical conductivity measurement were fully discussed through HFSS simulation and NaCl solution test. In the soil column experiment, four levels of salinity, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, and 1. 0 % were set, the soil water content decreased from 30 % in mass through the evaporation and measured by TDR and electronic <b>balance.</b> Then the <b>probe</b> was calibrated by model of Topp and Evett with these data. Results and discussion: The results show that probe has the largest EPA (polarization degree index) in angle from 97 ° to 138 °; the non-working rod will enhance the EPA during this angle range and the four-wire probe with angle of 120 ° is optimal; the PVC is a better insulated material which can improve the effective salinity scope; the Evett model could improve the water content measurement greatly especially in soil with higher salinity.

This thesis examines the characteristics of time stability, the reliability and representativeness of snow probing locations, and the scope for reducing the snow measurement surveys at two glaciers. The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate s (NVE) long-term snow distribution archives at Hellstugubreen and Gråsubreen cover 48 and 44 years respectively, and provide {{a unique opportunity to}} investigate snow distributions on two proximate glaciers, allowing inter-comparisons. Throughout, data years are categorised into quarters, thus exposing variable snow spatial distribution patterns relative to overall precipitation levels. Stability maps and statistics are computed on a cell-by-cell basis. Results find strong spatial heterogeneity in snow distributions, and increasing time stability with snow levels at both glaciers. Good time stability is also found at low precipitation levels at Gråsubreen. Overall, Hellstugubreen is more time stable than Gråsubreen. Reliability maps of representative probing locations are used to reduce survey designs, allowing resampling and reconstructions of winter balances. One index site for glacier-wide winter <b>balance</b> and one <b>probing</b> location per 50 m elevation interval are used. These calculations are done for all compiled data years, or combined quarters of data years. Winter balance reconstructions produce records within < 0. 10 m w. e. and < 0. 15 m w. e. of official winter balances at Hellstugubreen and Gråsubreen. Mean percentage errors are < 6. 2 % and < 13. 7 % respectively. The most accurate winter balance reconstructions use one probing per 50 m elevation interval, and quartered data years. Using centreline only probings underestimates winter balance, most dramatically at Hellstugubreen. Several strongly irregular snow spatial distribution years are found, creating inconsistent results. These years are considered to be affected by localised irregular wind conditions...|$|R

Such a system would provide the capability of access to the internal condition of the cartilage matrix and thus extend the vision-based arthroscopy that is currently used beyond the subjective evaluation of surgeons. The system required must be able to non-destructively probe the entire thickness of the cartilage and its immediate subchondral bone layer. In this thesis, near infrared spectroscopy is investigated for the purpose mentioned above. The aim is to relate it to the structure and load bearing properties of the cartilage matrix to the near infrared absorption spectrum and establish functional relationships that will provide objective, quantitative and repeatable categorization of cartilage condition outside the area of visible degradation in a joint. Based on results from traditional mechanical testing, their innovative interpretation and relationship with spectroscopic data, new parameters were developed. These were then evaluated for their consistency in discriminating between healthy viable and degraded cartilage. The mechanical and physico-chemical properties were related to specific regions of the near infrared absorption spectrum that were identified as part of the research conducted for this thesis. The relationships between the tissue's near infrared spectral response and the new parameters were modeled using multivariate statistical techniques based on partial least squares regression (PLSR). With significantly high levels of statistical correlation, the modeled relationships were demonstrated to possess considerable potential in predicting the properties of unknown tissue samples in a quick and non-destructive manner. In order to adapt near infrared spectroscopy for clinical applications, a <b>balance</b> between <b>probe</b> diameter and the number of active transmit-receive optic fibres must be optimized. This was achieved {{in the course of this}} research, resulting in an optimal probe configuration that could be adapted for joint tissue evaluation. Furthermore, as a proof-of-concept, a protocol for obtaining the new parameters from the near infrared absorption spectra of cartilage was developed and implemented in a graphical user interface (GUI) -based software, and used to assess cartilage-on-bone samples in vitro. This conceptual implementation has been demonstrated, in part by the individual parametric relationship with the near infrared absorption spectrum, the capacity of the proposed system to facilitate real-time, non-destructive evaluation of cartilage matrix integrity. In summary, the potential of the optical near infrared spectroscopy for evaluating articular cartilage and bone laminate has been demonstrated in this thesis. The approach could have a spin-off for other soft tissues and organs of the body. It builds on the earlier work of the group at QUT, enhancing the near infrared component of the ongoing research on developing a tool for cartilage evaluation that goes beyond visual and subjective methods...|$|R
40|$|On Taku Glacier, Alaska a {{combination}} of field observations of snow water equivalent (SWE) from snowpits and probing {{in the vicinity of}} the transient snowline (TSL) are used to quantify the mass balance gradient. The balance gradient derived from the TSL and SWE measured in snowpits at 1000 m from 1998 – 2010 ranges from 2. 6 – 3. 8 mm m− 1 . Probing transects from 950 m– 1100 m directly measure SWE and yield a slightly higher balance gradient of 3. 3 – 3. 8 mm m− 1 . The TSL on Taku Glacier is identified in MODIS and Landsat 4 and 7 Thematic Mapper images for 31 dates during the 2004 – 2010 period to assess the consistency of its rate of rise and reliability in assessing ablation for mass balance assessment. For example, in 2010, the TSL was 750 m on 28 July, 800 m on 5 August, 875 m on 14 August, 925 m on 30 August, and 975 m on 20 September. The mean observed <b>probing</b> <b>balance</b> gradient was 3. 3 mm m− 1 , combined with the TSL rise of 3. 7 m day− 1 yields an ablation rate of 12. 2 mm day− 1 from mid-July to mid-Sept, 2010. The TSL rise in the region from 750 – 1100 m on Taku Glacier during eleven periods each covering more than 14 days during the ablation season indicates a mean TSL rise of 3. 7 m day− 1 , the rate of rise is relatively consistent ranging from 3. 1 to 4. 4 m day− 1 . This rate is useful for ascertaining the final ELA if images or observations are not available near the end of the ablation season. The mean ablation from 750 – 1100 m during the July–September period determined from the TSL rise and the observed balance gradient is 11 – 13 mm day− 1 on Taku Glacier during the 2004 – 2010 period. The potential for providing an estimate of bn from TSL observations late in the melt season from satellite images combined with the frequent availability of such images provides a means for efficient mass balance assessment in many years and on many glaciers...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the water consumption and the crop coefficients (Kc) for the potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), in Seropédica, Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Brazil, under organic management, and to simulate the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) using the Kc obtained in the field and the ones recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The water consumption was obtained through soil water <b>balance,</b> using TDR <b>probes</b> installed at 0. 15 m and 0. 30 m deep. At the different stages of development, the Kc was determined by the ratio of ETc and reference evapotranspiration, obtained by Penman-Monteith FAO 56. The crop coefficients obtained were 0. 35, 0. 45, 1. 29 and 0. 63. The accumulated ETc obtained in the field was 109. 6 mm, while the ETc accumulated from FAO's Kc were 142. 2 and 138 mm, respectively, considering the classical values and the values adjusted to the local climatic conditions. The simulation of water consumption based on meteorological data of historical series from 1961 to 2007 provided higher value of ETc when compared with the one obtained in the field. From the meteorological data of historical series, it was observed that the use of Kc recommended by FAO may overestimate the amount of irrigation water by 9 %, over the same growing season. O trabalho foi desenvolvido visando a quantificar, sob manejo agroecológico, o consumo hídrico e os kcs para a cultura da batata (Solanum tuberosum L.), em Seropédica (RJ), e a simular a evapotranspiração da cultura (ETc), utilizando os kcs obtidos e os kcs preconizados pela FAO. O consumo hídrico foi obtido por meio do balanço hídrico do solo, utilizando sondas de TDR instaladas a 0, 15 e 0, 30 m de profundidade. Nas diferentes fases de desenvolvimento, o kc foi determinado pela razão entre a ETc e a evapotranspiração de referência, obtida por Penman-Monteith FAO 56. Os kcs obtidos foram 0, 35; 0, 45; 1, 29 e 0, 63. A ETc acumulada obtida em campo foi de 109, 6 mm, enquanto as ETcs acumuladas a partir dos kcs FAO foram de 142, 2 e 138, 0 mm, respectivamente, considerando os valores clássicos e os corrigidos para as condições climáticas locais. A simulação do consumo hídrico com base nos dados meteorológicos da série histórica de 1961 a 2007 proporcionou valor maior de ETc quando comparado ao obtido em campo. A partir dos dados meteorológicos obtidos na série histórica, observou-se que a utilização de kcs preconizados pela FAO pode superestimar a quantidade de água na irrigação em 9 %, considerando o mesmo período de cultivo...|$|R
40|$|Hearing {{parents of}} deaf {{children}} who are reliant on Sign Language {{need to learn to}} sign to ensure communication mode-match with their children. Signing is vital for parent-child interaction, and has implications for the socio-emotional well-being and educational outcomes of the child. However, poor signing skills of parents is repeatedly reported in the literature, with the majority of children in signing educational programmes reported not to be exposed to signing in the home. Teaching parents to sign therefore appears a priority, with sign teaching strategies being debated in the literature. The learning of Sign Language as a second language by hearing parents of deaf children within the bilingual educational approach, which regards Sign Language as the first language of deaf children, raises the challenges of cross-modality language learning for hearing parents. Reports on teaching methods are mainly anecdotal with only a few studies addressing sign learning by hearing individuals. While the use of graphic representations of signs is a common practice in teaching signs, there is no empirical data on their influence on the learning of signs. This study explored the contribution of graphic representations of signs in sign teaching. The main aim {{of the study was to}} describe the impact of sign illustrations on the teaching of signs to hearing mothers. Two sub-aims were formulated to compare the conditions of sign learning with and without the use of sign illustrations in graphic displays in terms of (a) sign reception and sign production, and (b) the amount and nature of assistance required in learning signs. An Adapted Alternating Treatments Design (AATD), with four theme-based sign sets, and <b>probes</b> <b>balanced</b> for equivalence, was developed and used. Four biological mothers of three boys and a girl in a Grade Three class at a day school for the deaf in an urban area of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa took part in the study. The results revealed no significant differences between the two training strategies for sign acquisition, in terms of sign reception and sign production post-training. There were however, significant differences between the two training strategies with regard to assistance required while learning signs. The graphics strategy required significantly less trainer assistance (p< 0. 05). In addition, there were significant differences in the nature of assistance provided with the use of graphic representations. Significantly fewer repeated demonstrations of signs were required by the participants during self practice (p< 0. 01). There was a significantly higher number of corrections with the graphics strategy (p< 0. 01) initially, and this decreased over time, unlike with the signing-only strategy. It would appear that the sign illustrations were redundant during the initial stages of sign learning using a multimodal approach, but that they were relied on to trigger recall of signs during the self practice phase. Thus, the study confirmed the supportive role of sign illustrations in sign learning. The use of theme-based graphic displays of sign illustrations emerged as a viable method in teaching signs. The implications of these results and recommendations for future research are discussed. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009.
