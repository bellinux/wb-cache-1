50|$|A <b>tank</b> <b>container,</b> {{also known}} as ISO tank, is a {{specialized}} type of container designed to carry bulk liquids, such as chemicals, liquid hydrogen, gases and foodgrade products. Both hazardous and non hazardous products can be shipped <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> <b>containers.</b> A standard <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> is 20 ft long, 8 ft high and 8 ft wide. The tank, which is made from stainless steel, is held within a box-shaped frame with the same shape as an intermodal container. This allows it to be carried on multiple modes of transport, such as truck, rail and ship.|$|R
50|$|Jacob Stolt-Nielsen, Jr. (12 May 1931 - 15 February 2015) was a Norwegian entrepreneur. The {{founder of}} Stolt-Nielsen Limited, he is widely {{credited}} as {{the creator of}} the parcel tanker concept. He also pioneered and built successful businesses <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> <b>containers,</b> offshore oilfield services and aquaculture. He served as a director on the board of Stolt-Nielsen Limited, where his son, Niels Gregers Stolt-Nielsen, is chief executive officer.|$|R
50|$|Cargo ships {{transport}} dry {{and liquid}} cargo. Dry cargo can be transported in bulk by bulk carriers, packed directly onto a {{general cargo ship}} in break-bulk, packed in intermodal containers as aboard a container ship, or driven aboard as in roll-on roll-off ships. Liquid cargo is generally carried in bulk aboard tankers, such as oil tankers which may include both crude and finished products of oil, chemical tankers which may also carry vegetable oils other than chemicals and LPG/LNG tankers, although smaller shipments may be carried on <b>container</b> ships <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> <b>containers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the product}} many ISO <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> {{operators}} argue that Flexi Bags can be more costly and less environmentally sound. This is generally the case for higher value products and/or environmentally dangerous products, because the transport protection offered by a Flexi-bag is less {{and the level of}} product that is left in the flexi-bag (2 to 5%) is higher than the amount left <b>in</b> a <b>tank</b> <b>container.</b>|$|R
40|$|Two new {{air quality}} rules affect {{facilities}} that manage liquid wastes containing VOCs <b>in</b> <b>tanks,</b> <b>containers</b> and surface impoundments. Several traditional treatment processes {{can reduce the}} volatile organic content of the wastes before they reach downstream <b>tanks</b> or storage <b>containers,</b> thus helping facility owners avoid air emission compliance requirements. W hile the Clinton Administration and Congress face off over proposed revisions to the nation’s ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter, the EPA’s Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards is busy on other air quality fronts. It continues to churn out contentious new rules to control hazardous air pollutants. Two of EPA’s recent new rules-one promulgated under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the other under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) -are aimed directly at controlling volatile organic ai...|$|R
50|$|For on-site {{burning of}} used oil, the oil must be stored <b>in</b> <b>tanks</b> or <b>{{containers}},</b> above or underground.

40|$|Lured by {{the promise}} of bigger sales, {{companies}} are increasingly looking to raise the volume of international trade. Consequently, the amount of bulk products carried in containers and transported overseas exploded because of the flexibility and reliability of this type of transportation. However, minimizing the logistics costs arising from the container flow management across different terminals has emerged asa major problem that companies and affiliated third-party logistics firms face routinely. The empty tankcontainer allocation problem occurs in the context of intermodal distribution systems management and transportation operations carried out by logistic service provider companies. This paper considers the time-evolving supply chain system of an international logistic service provider company that transports bulk products loaded <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> via road, rail and sea. In such system, unbalanced movements of loaded <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> forces the company to reposition empty <b>tank</b> <b>containers.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to develop a mathematical model that supports tactical decisions for flow management of empty <b>tank</b> <b>containers.</b> The problem involves dispatching empty <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> of various types to the meet on-time delivery requirements and repositioning the other <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> to storage facilities, depots and cleaning stations. To this aim, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) multiperiod optimization model is developed. The model is analyzed and developed step by step, and its functionality is demonstrated by conducting experiments on the network from our case study problem, within the boarders of Europe. The case study constitutes three different scenarios of empty <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> allocation. The computational experiments show that the model finds good quality solutions, and demonstrate that cost and modality improvements can be achieved in the network The sensitivity analysis employs a set of data from our case study and randomly selected data to highlight certain features of the model and provide some insights regarding the model’s behavior...|$|R
50|$|Disease cures {{are almost}} always more {{expensive}} and less effective than simple prevention measures. Often precautions involve maintaining a stable aquarium that is adjusted for the specific species of fish that are kept and not over-crowding a tank or over-feeding the fish. Common preventive strategies include avoiding the introduction of infected fish, invertebrates or plants by quarantining new additions before adding them to an established tank, and discarding water from external sources rather than mixing it with clean water. Similarly, foods for herbivorous fish such as lettuce or cucumbers should be washed before being placed <b>in</b> the <b>tank.</b> <b>Containers</b> {{that do not have}} water filters or pumps to circulate water can also increase stress to fish. Other stresses on fish and tanks can include certain chemicals, soaps and detergents, and impacts to tank walls causing shock waves that can damage fish.|$|R
50|$|Though <b>in</b> the USA <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> are {{typically}} the same dimensions (20 * 8 * 8.5 ft). {{as a standard}} ISO ocean <b>container,</b> <b>tank</b> chassis are much longer than the typical 20 ft <b>container</b> chassis. <b>Tank</b> chassis typically measure 40 - 43 ft in length by 8 x 4 ft wide x tall. This chassis has a standard drop-frame design providing a lower center of gravity than conventional trailers and an overall length suitable to legally scale most tanks. Twistlocks provide a secure mounting mechanism for the tanks and {{eliminate the need for}} straps or chains. The lower center of gravity is crucial for reducing the chances of a roll over with the constant shifting weight of the liquid cargo. These chassis can also be fitted with additional accessories including: lift kits to facilitate product discharge, hose tubes, and hi/lo kits to carry two empty tanks.|$|R
50|$|In 1982, another {{industry}} caught Jaco|b’s attention. Stolt <b>Tank</b> <b>Containers</b> {{was established}} after {{the purchase of}} United <b>Tank</b> <b>Containers.</b> Starting out with only 400 <b>tank</b> <b>containers,</b> STC is today the world’s largest provider of door-to-door transportation services for bulk-liquid chemicals and food-grade products, with the total count of containers approaching 30,000.|$|R
50|$|Jacob Stolt-Nielsen helped {{establish}} United <b>Tank</b> <b>Containers</b> <b>in</b> 1978, starting small {{with only a}} few units. The outfit was eventually renamed Stolt <b>Tank</b> <b>Containers</b> (STC). It currently operates the world’s largest fleet of stainless steel ISO <b>tank</b> <b>containers,</b> with more than 31,000 units in service. The fleet is supported by a global network of 24 offices and 15 tank maintenance, repair and cleaning depots in locations worldwide.|$|R
50|$|A <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> is {{a vessel}} of {{stainless}} steel surrounded by an insulation and protective layer of usually polyurethane and aluminum. The vessel {{is in the middle}} of a steel frame. The frame is made according to ISO standards and is 19.8556 ft long, 7.874 ft wide and 7.874 ft or 8.374 ft high. The contents of the tank range from 17500 to 26000 L. There are both smaller and larger <b>tank</b> <b>containers,</b> which usually have a size different from the ISO standard sizes. For example, there are some 27000 L and above litre <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> <b>in</b> the European swap body fleets in Europe but they are not used on international business only on intra European traffic.The trade organization @TCO estimates that at the end of 2012 the global fleet of <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> was between 340,000 and 380,000. Most of these <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> are owned by operators and leasing companies.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Nanoparticles {{and carbon}} nanotubes-containing {{composites}} were deposited {{on a metal}} substrate by a micro-arc oxidizing technique. The nanocomposites were developed for their applied researches <b>in</b> fuel <b>tanks</b> and <b>containers</b> of space shuttles. Carbon-nanotube-reinforced composite materials are relatively new class of materials that require extensive investigations in emerging ap-plications at low (cryogenic) and high temperature environments. Two types of nanoparticle-reinforced polymeric composites were studied at flexural tests and thermal cycling between 200 °C and- 80 °C temperature with no visual cracks for two and half times more than a matrix. The poly-mer type and the curing process control the thermal cycle response and ultimate durability of the composites in extreme temperature environments. To validate {{the use of the}} simplified two-dimensional models, a comparison is made with three-dimensional calculations...|$|R
50|$|The <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> {{concept was}} also {{employed}} in Europe by Bob Fossey, an engineer {{who worked for}} Williams Fairclough in London. They improved on the 1950s framed American elliptical <b>container</b> <b>tanks,</b> oft noted carrying specified USA engine oils for the UK’s MoD aircraft built in Preston, Lancashire. In 1964 Fairclough made a swap body tank for combined transport by truck and train, but not yet constructed according to ISO standards. In 1966, commercial production began and one year later the first <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> to ISO dimensions was developed. The first mass-produced <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> were purchased by Trafpak, a part of Pakhoed.|$|R

50|$|A <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> can {{be loaded}} and {{unloaded}} {{from the top}} and the bottom. On a standard <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> there is a manhole {{and at least one}} valve on the top, and there is a valve at the bottom. Loading and unloading is done by connecting hoses of the loading and unloading facility to the valves of the tank. The loading or unloading is often done using a pump. Depending on the installation and regulation of certain products, it is determined how the <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> should be loaded or unloaded.|$|R

50|$|<b>Tank</b> <b>container</b> chassis, also {{referred}} to as tank chassis, drop frame chassis or tank trailers, are a form of intermodal transportation for portable bulk liquid <b>containers</b> or ISO <b>tank</b> <b>containers.</b> They are characteristically longer and have lower deck height ideal for transporting constantly shifting payloads. The invention of the <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> revolutionized the way bulk liquids were transported, stored, and handled worldwide. It has improved safety, reduced costs and brought with it the benefits of convenience and efficiency associated with a multi-modal transport system. Invariably the invention of the drop frame chassis followed soon after to accommodate this new type of intermodal container.|$|R

25|$|Most filling {{stations}} are {{built in a}} similar manner, {{with most of the}} fueling installation underground, pump machines in the forecourt and a point of service inside a building. Single or multiple fuel tanks are usually deployed underground. Local regulations and environmental concerns may require a different method, with some stations storing their fuel <b>in</b> <b>container</b> <b>tanks,</b> entrenched surface tanks or unprotected fuel tanks deployed on the surface. Fuel is usually offloaded from a tanker truck into the tanks through a separate valve, located on the filling station's perimeter. Fuel from the tanks travels to the dispenser pumps through underground pipes. For every fuel tank, direct access must be available at all times. Most tanks can be accessed through a service canal directly from the forecourt.|$|R

40|$|Effective {{logistics}} {{is the key}} {{to improving}} supply chain performance. <b>Tank</b> <b>containers</b> are attractive from the viewpoints of safety, cost, and environment, and are widely used for transporting fluid chemicals. Minimizing the logistics costs arising from the container flow imbalances across the globe and container cleaning is a major issue that chemical companies and affiliated third-party logistics firms face routinely. In contrast to dry containers, this important problem of managing <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> <b>in</b> global chemical logistics has received no attention. An innovative, event-based, pull approach is presented for the minimum-cost or the maximum-profit scheduling of the transport and cleaning of multiproduct <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> (loaded and empty) given a set of projected shipment orders. A novel linear programming formulation is developed and illustrated through examples that successfully solves large, industrially relevant problems with key practical considerations such as alternate ship schedules, delivery time windows, and intermodal transport routes.
