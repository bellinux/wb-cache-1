This forces companies to cut their cost through organisational restructuring, closing down of mines and cost-saving technologies. All of these result in job losses in the mining sector. However, the companies do have a social responsibility to help uplift and create jobs in the mining areas and labour-sending regions. The study reviews examples of corporate-social-development projects of mines that relate to agriculture. Furthermore, the study looks at projects stemming from the government’s desire for land reform and rural social-economic upliftment of previously disadvantaged communities. In this context contract farming is an ideal way to tackle comprehensively the re-employment challenges. Against that background, which combines literature review and <b>brief</b> <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>case</b> studies, the dissertation reviews contract farming as an approach towards agricultural development and job creation. The lessons from the socio-economic development projects, rural-reforms and contract-farming projects are used as inputs to evolve a framework for the local approach to contract farming, related to mining areas. This includes considerations of implementation challenges likely to be experienced...|$|R

40|$|Somatic {{embryogenesis}} (SE) {{technology is}} expected to {{play a significant role}} in future forest tree improvement programs. Methods for efficient SE propagation in softwood species based on bioreactors are underway [1]. Furthermore, genetic transformation through SE is also the most promising approach to generate and propagate elite recalcitrant genotypes of forest trees [2], or clonal propagation of selected endangered high-value forest trees [3, 4]. Somatic embryogenesis induction was first reported for the genus Eucalyptus in 1980. Mass production of SE plants however remains difficult although procedures designed for plant regeneration have been reported for E. citriodora, E. grandis, E. tereticornis[5]. Recent data on E. globulus are promising and show the potential of this technology for application in clonal forestry [6, 7]. A service platform for routine transformation of forest trees has been established at the Berzelii Center at Umeå Plant Science Centre using Norway spruce as the primary model species for gene function analyses. Other target species for future studies include hardwood species such as Poplar and Eucalyptus. We present here a <b>brief</b> <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> a <b>case</b> study for introduction of a recalcitrant forest species to the platform as demonstrated by the establishment of the SE technology for E. globulus following protocol previously established in Portugal [6, 7] and preliminary results aiming to improve the induction of SE.

40|$|Solla is {{noteworthy}} not merely {{in light of}} the baleful effects of its ruling, but because of its reasoning: it is categorically wrong. The decision wholly elides a cornerstone and settled principle of New York welfare law, namely, that in the administration of public assistance, the municipalities act as the agents of the State, while blatantly violating the most fundamental of agency principles, namely, that a principal is vicariously liable for the actions of its agent acting within the scope of its authority. Indeed, this principal/agent relationship is established both by statute and by decades of uniform state and federal rulings, specifically with regard to public assistance and the EAJA statute. This includes, ironically, Court of Appeals decisions directly on point, as we shall see. In the realm of public welfare law, it is difficult to overstate the enormity, and the clarity, of the court’s error. This article provides an overview of the relevant social services law. Section II. A. discusses the established principle that municipalities act as the agents of the State of New York in the administration of public assistance benefits. Section II.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this article is whether it is ethical for {{physicians}} to participate in the evaluation or treatment of condemned prisoners who are incompetent. According to Ward, this may be the 2 ̆ 2 ultimate question, faced by psychiatrists who are asked to deal with execution competency. This article is not intended to offer an answer to this question. Rather, it seeks to (1) elucidate issues connected to the 2 ̆ 2 ultimate question 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 resolution, (2) articulate a set of premises within which psychiatrists should evaluate their relationship to institutions whose purposes include punishing criminals, and (3) suggest that, if the death penalty itself is just, then there are no coherent ethical objections to psychiatric participation.

Particular attention is given to those issues that might trouble psychiatrists contemplating evaluation or treatment of the potentially incompetent condemned.

40|$|We {{describe}} the <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> five patients having a syndrome of chronic abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss, and features of intestinal pseudo-obstruction associated with prolonged use or abuse of narcotic analgesics. In each patient, abdominal complaints were originally attributed to either mechanical bowel obstruction or an underlying gastrointestinal disorder often involving prior abdominal surgery. Symptoms resolved rapidly in all patients when narcotic administration was stopped. Clonidine therapy {{was used to}} alleviate symptoms of narcotic analgesic withdrawal. The narcotic bowel syndrome is a clinically important and frequently unrecognized cause of chronic abdominal pain. O P I A T E COMPOUNDS have wide-ranging effects on gas-trointestinal function (1 - 3). Prolonged or excessive use of narcotic analgesics may produce symptoms and signs of anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and profound constipation associated with marked delays in gastric emptying and intestinal transit (4 - 7). Despite these known effects, narcotic-induced gut alterations are typi-cally overlooked as a potential cause of chronic abdominal pain in patients using or abusing opiates. In fact, larger doses of narcotic analgesics are frequently ad-ministered at shorter dosing intervals to control worsen-ing abdominal pain. This approach may result in an esca-lating cycle of pain, followed by narcotic administration, followed by more pain. We {{describe the}} <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> five patients who were taking large doses of opiate analgesics to control abdominal pain. The essential role of narcotics in establishing and perpetuating the cycle of pain was shown by the complete and long-term resolution of symptoms in all patients after therapy with opiate analgesics was discontinued.

METHODS The methods used in {{the determination of the}} total pulmonary capacity and its subdivisions, the nomenclature adopted, and the normal findings, both in males and in females, have been fully presented in previous papers (1), (2). The only modification in the technique previously described is that the determinations were made with the patients in the sitting posture, because some were disturbed by severe orthopnea. In five cases the pul-monary capacity was determined during the acute respiratory distress of the asthmatic attack, and again a few minutes after the subcutaneous ad-ministration of epinephrine, when the paroxysm had been relieved. In a sixth case the second determination was made two days later, after the acute symptoms had subsided; in this case no epinephrine had been ad-ministered.

40|$|As online {{shopping}} has been depriving market share {{from the traditional}} retailers, the importance of keywords used in online searching has also increased. Companies selling their products or services online might wish to maximise their visibility by using as many keywords as possible {{to draw attention to}} their merchandise, including also keywords that correspond to a competitor’s trademark. The brand-conscious trademark owners have felt unfairly biased by such marketing strategies and have tried to sue not only the advertisers but the internet intermediaries. This paper firstly explains what keyword advertising is and why it is used before providing a <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> trademark legislation in EU and explaining that the justification for trademark protection is increasing information to the consumers and hence lowering their search costs. A <b>brief</b> <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> the previous <b>case</b> law <b>of</b> the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “CJEU”) in connection with comparative advertising is provided as that serves as the backdrop for the keyword cases. Then a thorough examination of how the courts in the EU have interpreted the liability of the advertisers and the internet intermediaries for keyword advertising. The potential liability of online market places is also discussed. Based on the case law, this thesis argues that the CJEU has lost sight of the consumer benefit as an original justifications for trademark regulation and have interpreted the infringement provisions so widely that trademarks have become very close to proprietary rights potentially posing risks for the fundamental freedoms. This trend started with comparative advertising, which was the predecessor to keyword advertising and has created problems for the courts in subsequent cases. As a result <b>of</b> earlier <b>case</b> law in the area of comparative advertising, the CJEU has had to utilise various assumptions and circular arguments to ensure that the risk of confusion {{is one of the main}} elements to determining liability for the purchase of someone else’s trademark as keyword. This paper provides also a critical analysis of the various elements of determining confusion, focussing on the initial interest confusion doctrine and the concept of average internet user. Further, this paper suggests that, as a result of the extended functions of the trademarks introduced by the CJEU, the exact borders of finding confusion have not been clearly set for the national courts. With the help of comparisons to United States case law, this paper makes some suggestions for amending the law to ensure that original aim of better information for consumers is better served. Finally some analysis on how the intermediaries and advertisers might avoid confusion in practice is provided...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} said that Filártiga v. Pena-Irala is the Brown v. Board of Education of human rights litigation. Like Brown, Filártiga {{presents}} one of those rare breakthrough moments in law. In Filártiga, the Second Circuit confirmed that victims of human rights abuses abroad could seek legal redress in United States courts under the then-obscure Alien Tort Statute (ATS). Filártiga thus inaugurated a steady line <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> in U. S. courts invoking the ATS and related statutes to adjudicate international human rights claims. For a variety of reasons, including the very existence of these statutes, civil litigation has emerged as a prominent means for the promotion of international human rights norms in the United States. Beyond the shared status <b>of</b> the two <b>cases</b> as legal watersheds, the analogy between these cases merits greater scrutiny. Accordingly, this essay meditates on the way in which Filártiga and its progeny simultaneously fit within, and diverge from, the model of public impact litigation inaugurated - or at least exemplified - by Brown. A <b>brief</b> <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> these <b>cases</b> reveals that in some respects, ATCA-style litigation is a more modest enterprise, akin to personal injury or mass tort suits involving individual victims seeking redress for violations of international norms. That said, human rights advocates share the ambitions of practitioners of public impact litigation in using judicial processes to transcend the dispute between individual litigants, advance a particular political cause or agenda, and produce lasting and systemic changes in countries where human rights violations occur. At the same time, these cases are no longer exclusively a tactic of human rights lawyers. Members of the plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 bar, who are perhaps motivated more by the potential high stakes promised by these cases than by ideological or reform goals, are increasingly initiating such suits. Thus the diversification of human rights litigation in terms of actors, desired outcomes, and motivations resists classification as any one litigation model. This Essay then discusses the various impacts ATS-style litigation in United States can have on plaintiffs, their communities, defendants, potential defendants, the human rights movement, and other processes of social change in target countries. A necessarily impressionistic survey of the results <b>of</b> ATS-style <b>cases</b> filed to date reveals that these impacts are most salient with respect to the parties involved and their immediate communities. The broader impact of human rights litigation is more speculative, as it remains difficult to measure to what degree ATS-style litigation has contributed to the deterrence of perpetrators and ultimately the reform of states 2 ̆ 7 treatment of their citizens and others within their jurisdiction and control. This Article argues that because confirmed first order effects remain worthy of praise and replication, this lack of empirical proof of broader second order effects does not undermine this effort. Indeed, practitioners of ATS-style litigation should be wary of espousing an overabundance of objectives for this litigation, because doing so may undermine or overshadow what these cases do accomplish for individual victims of human rights abuses. Likewise, it is argued that human rights advocates should not pin their hopes on achieving these broader impacts at the expense of their clients and their clients 2 ̆ 7 experience with the litigation process. In any case, notwithstanding the first and second order effects that have been achieved, this Essay cautions that such litigation should not replace other forms of human rights advocacy. An over-reliance on adversarial litigation, as opposed to other processes of social change, raises some of the same concerns that surface in the civil rights context about the efficacy of resorting to law and the judicial process to promote durable social change and the ability of the judicial process to address major social and economic problems...|$|R
