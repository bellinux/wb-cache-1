40|$|This paper {{presents}} a conventional approach for assessing highway visibility {{at night in}} foggy weather, based on the Visibility Level (VL) concept. The method is adapted from a nighttime visibility assessment method published earlier. First, we recall the basics of the VL concept and the associated target visibility computation model. We also recall the conventional obstacle collision scenario which serves to estimate the nighttime visibility distance {{as a function of}} pavement retroreflectivity for a given headlamp beam pattern, using the <b>basic</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>photometry.</b> Then we introduce the visibility impairing effects of fog. The first effect is the exponential attenuation of luminance with distance, described by Beer-Lambert law. The second effect is the veiling luminance generated by the backscattering of headlight, for which we propose an empirical model based on physically-based simulations. We apply the presented approach to low-beam and high-beam patterns in different fog conditions, and we bring quantitative proof for the need to dip the headlamps in dense fog. Finally, we discuss the potential benefits of the presented approach for road operation as well as for automotive front-lighting and advanced driver aiding system design...|$|R

The method is adapted from a nighttime visibility assessment method published earlier. First, we recall the basics of the VL concept and the associated target visibility computation model.

40|$|The {{value of}} {{absorption}} of light energy {{is dependent on}} the number of molecules present in absorbing material and the thickness of the medium. Thus, intensity of light energy leaving the absorbing substance is used as an indication of concentration of that particular substance. If the thickness i. e. path length of the light energy in the sample holder, normally the flow through cell and intensity of incident light energy are kept constant, then the amount of light energy transmitted out of the absorbing media is proportional to the concentration of the media. Usually the transmitted light energy and concentration are related to Lambert’s and Beer’s <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>photometry.</b> However, the Lambert’s and Beer’s <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>photometry</b> is valid or linear up to the optical density of 2. 0. In the presented work, it is proposed to facilitate the Lambert’s and Beer’s <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>photometry</b> to go beyond optical density of 2. 0 and measure the concentrations of sample at high value...|$|R
