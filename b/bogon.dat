5|$|Following their {{previous}} adventure, after saving the galaxy and defeating Chairman Drek, Ratchet and Clank become celebrities, though their lives remain otherwise uneventful. After giving {{an interview for}} the holovision show Behind the Hero, the pair suddenly find themselves teleported to the <b>Bogon</b> galaxy by Abercrombie Fizzwidget, the founder and CEO of MegaCorp, the galaxy's largest maker of consumer goods and electronics, who requests Ratchet's help to recover a stolen biological experiment from a masked thief, while offering Clank employment in the company, both of whom agree to the opportunities offered. Upon completing an extensive training regime, Ratchet is tasked to travel to a flying laboratory on planet Aranos where the experiment was last seen, but before he can retrieve it, the thief manages to escape with it. Reporting back to Fizzwidget, Ratchet soon begins pursuing the thief, only to receive a video message showing that the culprit has captured Clank.|$|E
5|$|Convinced that Fizzwidget is {{unaware of}} the Protopet's flaws, Ratchet goes to warn him during a promotionary event being held on planet Boldan, only to {{discover}} {{it to be a}} trap by the Thugs-4-Less boss, after cancelling their contract with Angela to work with MegaCorp. Captured, the pair find themselves transported to Aranos and aboard the same vessel, now being used as a remote prison, but manage to escape confinement. Discovering that Angela was captured by them, the pair track the mercenaries to their hideout on planet Snivelak, defeating their boss and saving Angela. Intent on stopping Fizzwidget, the group head for MegaCrop's Headquarters, only to discover that the CEO is none other than disgraced hero Captain Qwark. In a bid to restore his reputation, Qwark took over MegaCorp as Fizzwidget, with the intention of unleashing the Protopet upon the galaxy, so he can use a device created by Angela to defeat the creatures and make himself famous again. When he demonstrates the device, however, it malfunctions and transforms the original Protopet into a gigantic beast that devours him. While Angela goes to rescue the real Fizzwidget, Ratchet subdues the Protopet and saves Qwark's life. With Clank's help, Angela fixes the device and broadcasts a signal through MegaCorp's TV transponders, neutralizing the Protopets and restoring peace to the <b>Bogon</b> galaxy.|$|E
25|$|Most {{switches}} {{have some}} rate-limiting and ACL capability. Some switches provide automatic and/or system-wide rate limiting, traffic shaping, delayed binding (TCP splicing), deep packet inspection and <b>Bogon</b> filtering (bogus IP filtering) {{to detect and}} remediate DoS attacks through automatic rate filtering and WAN Link failover and balancing.|$|E
50|$|Many ISPs and {{end-user}} firewalls {{filter and}} block <b>bogons,</b> {{because they have}} no legitimate use, and usually are the result of accidental or malicious misconfiguration. <b>Bogons</b> can be filtered by using router access control lists (ACLs), or by BGP blackholing.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bogons</b> {{also include}} {{reserved}} private address and link-local address ranges, {{such as those}} in , , , and , which are reserved for private networks, sometimes also known as Martian packets.|$|R
5000|$|For example, {{addresses}} in [...] {{were not}} allocated prior to August 2010, but are now used by APNIC. As time goes on, the IPv4 address exhaustion will {{mean there are}} fewer and fewer IPv4 <b>bogons.</b>|$|R
25|$|These schemes {{will work}} {{as long as}} the DoS attacks can be {{prevented}} by using them. For example, SYN flood can be prevented using delayed binding or TCP splicing. Similarly content based DoS may be prevented using deep packet inspection. Attacks originating from dark addresses or going to dark addresses can be prevented using <b>bogon</b> filtering. Automatic rate filtering can work as long as set rate-thresholds have been set correctly. Wan-link failover will work as long as both links have DoS/DDoS prevention mechanism.|$|E

50|$|The term <b>bogon</b> {{stems from}} hacker jargon, {{where it is}} defined as the quantum of bogosity, or the {{property}} of being bogus. A <b>bogon</b> packet is frequently bogus both in the conventional sense of being forged for illegitimate purposes, and in the hackish sense of being incorrect, absurd, and useless.|$|E

This allowed gamma and neutron radiation to pass uninhibited to an unmanned detection station housed in a bunker on <b>Bogon.</b>|$|E
50|$|IP {{addresses}} {{that are}} currently in the <b>bogon</b> space may not be bogons {{at a later date}} because IANA and other registries frequently assign new address space to ISPs. Announcements of new assignments are often published on network operators' mailing lists (such as NANOG) to ensure that operators have a chance to remove <b>bogon</b> filtering for addresses that have become legitimate.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bogon</b> {{filtering}} is {{the practice}} of filtering bogons, which are bogus (fake) IP addresses of a computer network. Bogons include IP packets on the public Internet that contain addresses {{that are not in}} any range allocated or delegated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) or a delegated regional Internet registry (RIR) and allowed for public internet use. The areas of unallocated address space are called the <b>bogon</b> space.|$|E

50|$|In ingress filtering, packets {{coming into}} the network are {{filtered}} if the network sending it should not send packets from the originating IP address(es).

50|$|The game {{takes place}} in a {{different}} setting than the first installment, this time in the <b>Bogon</b> Galaxy. In Going Commando, Ratchet is able to compete in hoverbike races and engages in spaceship battles. This game introduces the leveling system for weapons that appears in every succeeding game; using a given weapon enough - and thus gaining enough experience - causes it to evolve into a more powerful version with upgraded stats and new abilities. Ratchet's experience-based health upgrade system is also introduced in this installment, as well as the ability to strafe for greater shooting accuracy during combat.|$|E

50|$|Trapped {{and alone}} on the dark {{continent}} of Eigo, Bazil and Relkin learn to fight and live off the dinosaurian wildlife that inhabits the land. During their journey of survival they encounter Lumbee, a female member of the tailed Ardu race. When they find her tribe, Relkin discovers he {{is in love with}} the tailed woman, a state that causes great distress to the members of her tribe. He is betrayed by the Ardu and sold to slavers who carry him off to the city of the Elf Lords, Mirchaz. To save his dragonboy, Bazil leads the Ardu in an attack on the slaver’s base, then marches on Mirchaz itself. Relkin has been trapped in a dream world created by an evil Elf Lord. When Bazil comes to the dragonboy’s rescue the pair manages to bring down the Great Game that occupies the Elf Lords and end their rule of Mirchaz. After their victory they return to Argonath from Og <b>Bogon</b> bearing much treasure from an appreciative king.|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{discovery}} of key defects {{in one of his}} bogus Gadgetron products, the Personal Hygenator, Qwark was revealed to be a fraud and was eventually arrested. After escaping during the events of the second game, Qwark travelled to the <b>Bogon</b> Galaxy and re-adopted his alias as Steve McQwark before continuing to sell more of his bogus products. Determined to recover his identity as a hero, Qwark kidnapped Megacorp founder Abercrombie Fizzwidget and disguised himself as Fizzwidget in order to hire Ratchet to recover the Protopet, which had been stolen by Angela Cross so she could destroy it. After recovering the Protopet, Qwark intended to neutralise the Protopet's destructive tendencies and blame these on Ratchet and Clank; his plan failed after the Helixamorph gadget he had taken from Angela amplified the Protopet's tendencies, causing it to eat Qwark. After Ratchet defeated the Protopet, Angela fixed the Helixamorph and used it to neutralise the Protopets; as punishment, Qwark joined Megacorp as a test subject including on a new device, the [...] "Crotchitizer".|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} factor in the robustness of the interdomain routing system is whether the routers in autonomous systems (ASes) filter routes for “bogon ” address space—i. e., private address space and address space that has not been allocated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). This paper presents an empirical study of <b>bogon</b> route announcements, as observed at eight vantage points on the Internet. On average, we observe several <b>bogon</b> routes leaked every few days; a small number of ASes also temporarily leak hundreds of <b>bogon</b> routes. About 40 % of these <b>bogon</b> routes are not withdrawn for at least a day. We observed 110 different ASes originating routes for <b>bogon</b> prefixes and a few ASes that were responsible for advertising a disproportionate number of these routes. We also find that some ASes that do filter unallocated prefixes continue to filter them for as long as five months after they have been allocated, mistakenly filtering valid routes. Both of these types of delinquencies have serious implications: the failure to filter valid prefixes can could make nefarious activities such as denial of service attacks difficult to trace; failure to update filters when new prefixes are allocated prevents legitimate routes from being globally visible...|$|E
