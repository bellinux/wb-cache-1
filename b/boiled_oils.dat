50|$|Linseed oil is {{extracted}} from {{the seeds of the}} flax plant, already extensively grown for the production of linen. The raw oil may be used, but it cures poorly and leaves a sticky surface. Normally boiled linseed oil is used. This has been prepared beforehand by boiling with lead, in the form of lead oxide, or with manganese salts. Modern <b>boiled</b> <b>oils</b> use a lead-free metallic drier added cold, such as cobalt resinate. Old linseed oil finishes yellow with age, owing to oxidation with the air. Linseed oil was also widely used for the production of oilcloth, a waterproof covering and rainwear material, formed by coating linen or cotton fabrics with the boiled oil.|$|E

25|$|Whole Peking Ducks can {{be ordered}} as takeaways. The ducks can be reheated at home with an oven, grill or <b>boiling</b> <b>oil.</b> When an oven is used, the duck is heated at a {{temperature}} of 150°C (300°F) for 20 minutes, and then at 160°C (325°F) for another 10 minutes. The grilling method involves filling the duck with boiling water before placing it on a griddle, 70cm (28in) above the cooking fire. The boiling water is replaced every 3–4 minutes until the duck's skin is piping hot.

50|$|A murder hole or meurtrière is {{a hole in}} {{the ceiling}} of a gateway or {{passageway}} in a fortification through which the defenders could fire, throw or pour harmful substances or objects, such as rocks, arrows, scalding water, hot sand, quicklime, tar, or <b>boiling</b> <b>oil,</b> down on attackers. <b>Boiling</b> <b>oil</b> was rarely used because of its cost. Similar holes, called machicolations, were often located in the curtain walls of castles, fortified manor houses, and city walls. The parapet would project over corbels so that holes would be located over the exterior face of the wall, allowing the defenders to target attackers {{at the base of the}} wall. At a later date people were hanged from these holes and then executed and the blood was dribbled down.|$|R
