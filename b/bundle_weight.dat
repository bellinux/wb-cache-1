40|$|Increases {{in protein}} {{production}} per unit land area for cereals (protein yield) generally have resulted from selection for high grain yield while maintaining or decreasing protein percentage. However, recent research showing grain yield and protein percentage may be inherited independently suggests that both of these traits can be utilized to enhance protein yield. In this study, three selection strategies were imposed upon different oat (Avena sativa L.) populations (i. e., lines of descent). The strategies were (a) protein yield selection per se (HGP); (b) selection for high protein yield due to high grain yield (HG); and (c) selection for high protein yield due {{to high levels of}} both protein content and grain yield (HP). S(, 1) line recurrent selection was the breeding method employed, and each cycle took one year to complete;Gains in groat-protein yield were significant and similar in all lines of descent, ranging from 21 kg ha(2 ̆ 7 - 1) in HG and HGP to 27 kg ha(2 ̆ 7 - 1) in HP. Correlated increases in groat yield were 147 kg ha(2 ̆ 7 - 1) in HG, 95 kg ha(2 ̆ 7 - 1) in HP, and 112 kg ha(2 ̆ 7 - 1) in HGP. Groat-protein content increased significantly in HP (3. 1 g kg(2 ̆ 7 - 1)), decreased in HG (- 1. 5 g kg(2 ̆ 7 - 1)), and remained constant in HGP. In all lines of descent, heritabilities for groat-protein yield, groat yield, and groat-protein content were moderately high ((GREATERTHEQ) 0. 41), and genetic variances generally were high and unchanged from C 0 to C 3, indicating the potential for continued progress from selection for single or multiple traits;Favorable correlated responses occurred for harvest index and <b>bundle</b> <b>weight,</b> whereas response in seed weight was dependent upon line of descent. Mild selection for heading date and plant height caused favorable response or no change for these traits, but reductions occurred for test weight and groat percentages in two lines of descent;These results indicate that groat yield and protein content can be increased concurrently in oats provided the proper germplasm source, selection pressure, and breeding methodology are applied. Further, S(, 1) line recurrent selection can be effective in rapidly improving an oat population for the trait under selection without losses in performance for other traits...|$|E

Divided edge bundling separates antiparallel edges into emergent “traffic lanes”, enabling inspection of network asymmetries, {{such as the}} connections between Berlin and London. (235 nodes, 2101 edges; 18. 1 seconds to bundle) Abstract—The node-link diagram is an intuitive and venerable way to depict a graph. To reduce clutter and improve the readability of node-link views, Holten & van Wijk’s force-directed edge bundling employs a physical simulation to spatially group graph edges. While both useful and aesthetic, this technique has shortcomings: it bundles spatially proximal edges regardless of direction, weight, or graph connectivity. As a result, high-level directional edge patterns are obscured. We present divided edge bundling to tackle these shortcomings. By modifying the forces in the physical simulation, directional lanes appear as an emergent property of edge direction. By considering graph topology, we only bundle edges related by graph structure. Finally, we aggregate edge <b>weights</b> in <b>bundles</b> to enable more accurate visualization of total <b>bundle</b> <b>weights.</b> We compare visualizations created using our technique to standard force-directed edge bundling, matrix diagrams, and clustered graphs; we find that divided edge bundling leads to visualizations that are easier to interpret and reveal both familiar and previously obscured patterns.

Merr.) were tested for variation in performance of quantitatively inherited traits and to estimate rates of spontaneous mutation in these species. Barley varities used were 2 ̆ 7 Larker, 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 7 Manker, 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Morex 2 ̆ 7 and soybean varieties were 2 ̆ 7 AP 27, 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 7 Coles, 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 7 HP 20 - 20, 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Wells. 2 ̆ 7 Sublines within each variety (family) represented six successive generations of progeny in a dichotomous scheme, beginning with a single, self-fertilized, homozygous seed. All sources of genetic contamination were controlled so that only mutation would contribute to the genetic variance among sublines within a family. Detailed measurements were made for quantitatively inherited traits in each family in replicated field experiments, and analyses of variance of subline means were used to detect genetic variation due to mutation. An L. S. D., calculated from the experimental error variance of a trait, was used to detect occurrences of mutational events which were summed and used to calculate rates of spontaneous mutations;The average spontaneous mutation rate for a trait in barley was 2. 0 /trait/ 100 gametes and for soybeans was 2. 3 /trait/ 100 gametes. Based on numbers of mutations, Manker and Morex were equal but more mutable than Larker, and AP 27 ranked more mutable than Coles, HP 20 - 20, and Wells. In barley, heading date, number of spikes per plot, <b>bundle</b> <b>weight,</b> and grain weight were the most mutable traits followed by flag leaf length, number of kernels per spike, plant height, and 100 seed weight. Harvest index was the least mutable. In soybeans, flowering date and number of nodes per plant were slightly more mutable than seed protein and seed oil percentage. Of the 27 trait-variety combinations in barley and 16 in soybeans, only two in barley and one in soybeans showed significant linear trends of generation means over the six generations. It was concluded that the rates of spontaneous mutation measured in these experiments would not pose a significant problem in the maintenance of varietal stability of performance in a seed certification program...|$|E
40|$|Spring oats (Avena sativa L.) are {{typically}} harvested in Iowa before mid-summer. Oats are a cool season crop, and their grain yield is frequently reduced {{by exposure to}} high temperatures during grain filling. Major emphasis has long been placed on selection for earlier maturity in oat breeding in Iowa because early varieties tend to escape severe heat stress. Often, unavoidable delays in planting or the early occurrence of hot weather in some seasons cause heat damage to be an all-too-frequent problem even with the earliest varieties available. Continued selection for earlier maturity likely would reduce the yield potential of oats by reducing the time available for photosynthesis and assimilation;My objective {{was to investigate the}} potential for breeding for increased tolerance to high temperatures and late planting in oats. Four date-of-planting treatments were used to compare the responses of genotypes from two populations of unselected experimental lines and a diverse set of oat varieties as checks;Grain yields were reduced in the three late planted treatments relative to the first or normal planting date treatment. There was a significant genotype-by-treatment interaction for <b>bundle</b> <b>weight,</b> grain yield, harvest index, straw yield, and vegetative growth duration in both populations and for seed number and vegetative growth rate in the population derived from the introgression of Avena sterilis L. germplasm into A. sativa. This population had a greater genetic variance for response to the treatments, but the other population, derived from crosses of lines adapted to Iowa, had a much better mean response. The checks did not vary in their grain yield response, and their mean response was not nearly as good as that of the latter population;The effect of late planting on grain yield was largely attributable to its influence on harvest index [...] the growth rates and total biological yields of oats in the later treatments were generally high. Lines that possessed good grain yield response to delayed planting generally were poor grain yielders in the first treatment, but a majority of the highest yielding genotypes in the late treatments also had high yields in the first treatment;The general conclusion was that, although there seemed to be genetic variability for tolerance to the stresses associated with late planting, the heritability of this trait was so low that progress from selection would be difficult...|$|E

Expressed on dry matter basis, the mean total ash content was 19. 2 %, crude protein content 26. 1 % and the crude fiber content 14. 7 %. The mean ascorbic acid content was 627 mg/ 100 g, zinc content 5. 5 m g/ 100 g and iron content 18 mg/ 100 g. The men nitrate content was 732. 5 mg/ 100 g, total oxalates 5830 mg/ 100 g and soluble oxalates 3650 mg/ 100 g, while the lead content averaged 1. 03 mg/ 100 g. The study concludes that vegetable amaranth has potential as popular vegetable in the diets of Kenyans to significantly contribute to provision of micronutrients, particularly iron and zinc...|$|R
40|$|Aim of the study: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate recent technological improvements to forest bundlers: a new cutting device with shears and a mechanism which allows the bundling pressure to be changed by the driver. Area of study: eucalyptus plantations in Northern Spain. Material and Methods: Several time studies were performed in order to compare and calculate productivity depending on the machine: John Deere bundler working with the traditional chainsaw and Monra bundler equipped with the technological improvements of shears and adjustable bundling pressure. Research highlights: Significant differences were found between cutting devices (shears and chainsaw) and between the Monra working at maximum pressure and at lower pressure. Shears were shown to be a more robust and reliable cutting device, with 1. 02 cutting attempts per bundle compared to 1. 55 with chain saw. The use of shears made the loading more efficient as it eliminates the need to shake the residues before feeding the bundler. A great advantage of this technological improvement is that it can be incorporated into other machines and thus improve bundling efficiency. In spite of this, working at standard bundling pressure, the productivity of the Monra bundler is only 3. 2 per cent higher than that of the John Deere due to the fact that in the latter bundling is faster and it produces bundles with significantly more dry mass. For the Monra bundler, the option of producing lighter bundles further reduced productivity compared to when standard <b>weight</b> <b>bundles</b> are produced. However, it would be of interest to study the effect of the machine working at various pressures in order to optimize the work system. It is possible that working at higher pressures would have advantages in terms of increasing transport efficiency...|$|R
