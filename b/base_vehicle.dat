The 25GT-X was only available as a sedan and had optional extras over the 25GT and 25GT-T such as tinted rear windows and pop-up LCD display that replaced the triple cluster on the turbo models.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of its operation, the BMD-1 had no analogues abroad. Its main {{armament}} was a 73mm smoothbore gun with a coaxial 7.62mm PKT machine gun. It also had a launcher rail for the 9M14 Malyutka. Additional armaments include two bow-mounted 7.62mm PKT machine guns in the front part of the vehicle, in addition to one ball joint firing port on either side and cover of the rear hatch to fire from individual weapons. The vehicle also featured a hydropneumatic suspension system capable of changing its ground clearance. A low weight of 7.5 t allowed it to be light enough to parachute from any types of military-transport aircraft. This airborne infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) also possessed one of the highest power-to-weight ratios at 32hp/tonne. The BMD-1 was the first domestically produced vehicle equipped with aluminum armor to ensure its light weight. The engineering incorporated in the BMD-1 allowed it {{to be used as a}} <b>base</b> <b>vehicle</b> for multiple variants including the BMD-1K and the BTR-D.|$|E
500|$|Development of The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man at Islands of Adventure {{began in}} 1996. Allen Ambrosini from At The Park Magazine stated theme park guests {{in the late}} 1990s were {{becoming}} more sophisticated, desiring rides that combined theming and thrills into a single immersive experience. As a result, the ride's creators set out to develop a ride which would take the motion simulation elements of , and combine them with a 3D film {{similar to that used}} on [...] The result was a prototype ride system combining a track-mounted motion <b>base</b> <b>vehicle</b> with 3D projections and other special effects, with the aim of immersing guests inside a comic book. To develop the attraction, Universal Creative brought together a number of companies including the Oceaneering Entertainment Systems division of Oceaneering International, Birket Engineering, Moog, Soundelux, Kleizer Walczak, and Rinehart Manufacturing.|$|E
40|$|A {{reusable}} {{space flight}} launch system is configured to eliminate complex descent and landing systems {{from the space}} flight hardware and move them to maneuverable ground based systems. Precision landing of the reusable space flight hardware is enabled using a simple, light weight aerodynamic device on board the flight hardware such as a parachute, and one or more translating ground <b>based</b> <b>vehicles</b> such as a hovercraft that include active speed, orientation and directional control. The ground <b>based</b> <b>vehicle</b> maneuvers itself into position beneath the descending flight hardware, matching its speed and direction and captures the flight hardware. The ground <b>based</b> <b>vehicle</b> will contain propulsion, command and GN&C functionality as well as space flight hardware landing cushioning and retaining hardware.

50|$|A normal car on tires {{has very}} limited {{capability}} for Antarctic conditions. Scientific bases are often built on snow free areas (oases) close to theocean. Around these stations {{and on a}} hard packed snow or ice, tire <b>based</b> <b>vehicles</b> can drive but on deeper and softer snow, a normal tire <b>based</b> <b>vehicle</b> cannot travel. Due to these limitation vehicles on belts have been the preferred option in Antarctica. In 1997 two specialized cars with very large tires running tire pressure as low as 1.5psi/0.1bar travelled onto the high Antarctica Plateau, giving strong indication that tire <b>based</b> <b>vehicles</b> could be an option for efficient travelling in Antarctica.|$|R

Traditional shallow model <b>based</b> <b>vehicle</b> detection algorithm still cannot meet the requirement of accurate vehicle detection in these applications. In this work, a novel deep learning <b>based</b> <b>vehicle</b> detection algorithm with 2 D deep belief network (2 D-DBN) is proposed. In the algorithm, the proposed 2 D-DBN architecture uses second-order planes instead of first-order vector as input and uses bilinear projection for retaining discriminative information so as to determine the size of the deep architecture which enhances the success rate of vehicle detection. On-road experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm performs better than state-of-the-art vehicle detection algorithm in testing data sets...|$|R
