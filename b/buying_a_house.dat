5|$|In 1957, Haefliger's extramarital affair, {{which had}} lasted {{for over a}} decade, came to an end. Bellette and Haefliger left Australia {{intending}} to divorce quietly, but were reconciled. After a year in Paris they settled in Majorca, living first in Deià before <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> in the hamlet of C'an Baxu. Bellette painted landscapes and still lifes that reflected a Spanish influence, and showed periodically in Australia through the 1960s. The year she moved to Majorca {{turned out to be}} the last year in which she exhibited work outside Australia. The couple visited in 1970 and 1975, and Bellette returned once more in 1983.|$|E
5|$|By December 1974, Lennon and Pang {{considered}} <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> together, and {{he refused}} to accept Ono's phone calls. The next month, Lennon agreed to meet with Ono, {{who claimed to have}} found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable, because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment with Pang; he was stupefied and confused {{to such an extent that}} Pang believed he had been brainwashed. He told her that his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.|$|E
5|$|A Book of Mediterranean Food was {{successful}} enough for Lehmann to commission David {{to write a}} sequel, to show the dishes of rural France. This was French Country Cooking, which David finished writing in October 1950. Minton was employed to illustrate the work, and David gave him detailed instructions about the type of drawings; she was more pleased with them than those for her first work. Despite their difficult relationship, David dedicated the book to her mother. Before the book was published, David left England to live {{for a short time}} in France. She was motivated by a desire to gain a wider knowledge of life in the French countryside, and to put distance between her and her husband. She left London in March 1951 for Ménerbes, Provence. She spent three months in Provence; although the weather was initially cold and wet, it soon turned warmer and she enjoyed herself so much that she considered <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> there. In June 1951 she left Ménerbes and travelled to the island of Capri to visit Norman Douglas. When she left in late August, she toured briefly around the Italian Riviera researching for an article for Go, before returning to London.|$|E

5|$|Prior {{to moving}} its {{headquarters}} to Chicago, aerospace manufacturer Boeing (#30) {{was the largest}} company based in Seattle. Its largest division is still headquartered in nearby Renton, and the company has large aircraft manufacturing plants in Everett and Renton, so it remains the largest private employer in the Seattle metropolitan area. Former Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels announced a desire to spark a new economic boom driven by the biotechnology industry in 2006. Major redevelopment of the South Lake Union neighborhood is underway, {{in an effort to}} attract new and established biotech companies to the city, joining biotech companies Corixa (acquired by GlaxoSmithKline), Immunex (now part of Amgen), Trubion, and ZymoGenetics. Vulcan Inc., the holding company of billionaire Paul Allen, is behind most of the development projects in the region. While some see the new development as an economic boon, others have criticized Nickels and the Seattle City Council for pandering to Allen's interests at taxpayers' expense. Also in 2006, Expansion Magazine ranked Seattle among the top 10 metropolitan areas in the nation for climates favorable to business expansion. In 2005, Forbes ranked Seattle as the most expensive American city for <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> based on the local income levels. In 2013, however, the magazine ranked Seattle No. 9 on its list of the Best Places for Business and Careers.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{evidence}} shows that because homeowners would allegedly keep their homes for longer, young households often rent for longer before <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>house.</b> Because Proposition 13 could be a disincentive to sell, there is less turnover among owners near the older downtown areas, resulting in an upward pressure on price appreciation in these areas.|$|E
25|$|Baker {{married for}} a third time in 1986, this time to Sue Jerrard, who had been an {{assistant}} editor on Doctor Who. They moved to the Bell House, a converted school in Boughton Malherbe, Kent, where they kept several cats before moving to France in January 2003. They sold the property to Vic Reeves shortly after Baker had worked with him on the BBC revival (2000–2001) of Randall and Hopkirk. In November 2006, Baker returned to live in England, initially <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, before later moving to East Sussex.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s {{private housing}} was {{developed}} in Docklands which with some minor exceptions {{were the first to}} be built in the area. Soon many people from outside the area saw the opportunity of <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> close to the city at what appeared to be cheap prices. On many of the developments, local council tenants were given first opportunities to buy at discounted prices, but this led to a number of abuses. Then again in the late 1990s, London had a huge house-price boom. By encouraging the development of attractive waterside apartments along the River Thames and the old docks, the LDDC brought new, middle-class residents into the area, closely followed by shops, restaurants and bars.|$|E
25|$|After a brief {{visit to}} London, the couple {{returned}} to Paris in September, <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> in a courtyard development off the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne (now Avenue Foch) where Debussy resided {{for the rest}} of his life. Their daughter (the composer's only child) Claude-Emma was born there on 30 October. Her parents eventually married in 1908, their troubled union enduring until Debussy's death in 1918. Claude-Emma, more affectionately known as 'Chouchou', was a great musical inspiration to the composer (she was the dedicatee of his Children's Corner suite). Claude-Emma outlived her father by scarcely a year, succumbing to the diphtheria epidemic of 1919 after her doctor administered the wrong treatment.|$|E
25|$|The family {{returned}} to Sydney in 1972, <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> in Belrose near the Northern Beaches when Michael was 12 years old. Michael attended Davidson High School, {{where he met}} Andrew Farriss and they became good friends. Around this time, Hutchence and Farriss {{spent a lot of}} time jamming in the garage with Andrew's brothers. Farriss then convinced Hutchence to join his band, Doctor Dolphin, alongside two classmates, Kent Kerny and Neil Sanders. From nearby Forest High School, bass guitarist Garry Beers and Geoff Kennelly on drums filled out the line-up. The boys transferred to Davidson High School where they became serious about the idea of starting a proper band. Hutchence's parents separated when he was 15; in 1976 for a short time, he lived with his mother and half-sister Tina in California. Hutchence later {{returned to}} Sydney with his mother.|$|E

25|$|There is one {{additional}} theory {{that explains the}} occurrence of the reminiscence bump: the life script account. A life script refers to the series of culturally important transitional events {{that are expected to}} occur in a certain order at various points during the life span. During early adulthood one starts to make important decisions and have influencing experiences on his or her identity. The memories during this time period are therefore more significantly remembered because they are what has essentially determined and influenced their life script (Habernas & Bluck, 2000). A life script typically has the majority of expected transitional experiences occur during early adulthood (Gluck & Bluck, 2007), and usually include includes positive experiences such as marriage, the birth of a baby, or <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>house.</b> Events that deviate from the life script are typically sad and traumatic. These events, such as the death of a child, are not culturally expected and often do not show a peak of recall at any specific point during the life span. Life scripts act as a way to structure memory and lead to the expectation that the happiest and the most important life events form the reminiscence bump. Contrary to the recall of happy events, the recall of sad events remains stable across the life span and does not exhibit a bump in recall.|$|E
25|$|He {{reached the}} Easter Cup final at Shelbourne {{and won the}} Spring Cup final at Harold's Cross Stadium and National Cup final at Shelbourne before {{travelling}} to England for the first time. In a solo trial prior to the 1929 English Greyhound Derby on 25 July, Mick broke the track record, reducing his odds from an initial 25–1 to becoming the 4–7 favorite to win {{by the time of}} the final, despite still being new off the board from Ireland. He was housed at the kennels of Paddy McEllistrim for the duration of the Derby. In the first round, Mick pulled away down the back straight, beating Captured Half by eight lengths and setting a time of 29.82, a new world record over that length. Father Browne sold Mick for £800, plus any prize money that the dog would win on the night, which at the time was more than the cost of <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> in nearby Shepherd's Bush. By 8:45pm, when the final took place, some 40,000 spectators were in the ground. The lineup was four dogs; in trap one was Beadsman at 20–1; trap two was Palatinus at 3–1; trap three was Entomb at 9–2, and finally Mick the Miller in trap four, wearing the black jacket. Palatinus made the best start, at the first bend both Mick and Entomb attempted to move inside to the rail, but Beadsman collided with both of them, sending all three dogs sprawling. The no–race klaxon went off, and the race had to be restarted. None of the dogs was allowed to leave the track with until the race was re–run at 9:15pm, the only comfort given to Mick on a particularly hot summer's evening was a handkerchief soaked in cold water.|$|E

2500|$|The {{real estate}} {{business}} practice of [...] "blockbusting" [...] was a for-profit catalyst for white flight and a means to control non-white migration. By subterfuge, real estate agents would facilitate black people <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> in a white neighborhood, either by buying the house themselves, or via a white proxy buyer, and then re-selling it to the black family. The remaining white inhabitants (alarmed by real estate agents and the local newsmedia), fearing devalued residential property, would quickly sell, usually at a loss. Losses happened when they sold en masse, and would sell the properties to the incoming black families, profiting from price arbitrage and the sales commissions from both the blacks and the whites. By such tactics, the racial composition of a neighborhood population often changed completely in a few years.|$|E
2500|$|Around this time, Alice {{caused a}} new {{sensation}} {{when it was}} revealed she had resumed her love affair with de Trafford, the man she had almost killed. A rumor that the couple would soon have a quiet wedding in Paris was first circulated in May 1927, then in September of that same year and later in January 1928. Alice's lawyer denied any such plans, and no wedding took place. The rumor surfaced again in April 1930. Ultimately, the couple married on 22 February 1932 in Neuilly-sur-Seine and spoke of <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> in London. Alice commented on her affair with de Trafford: [...] "We were deeply in love.

As he told a journalist 20 years later, [...] "Dr. Donald Cameron left his university office, drove to the village of D'Escousse, stepped into a phone booth and emerged as the award-winning author and playwright Silver Donald Cameron." [...] (He added the name [...] "Silver" [...] to set himself apart from the multitudes of other Camerons. Folk-singer Tom Gallant suggested the name because Cameron's head of prematurely grey hair was his most striking feature.) Cameron settled in D'Escousse after <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> he describes as [...] "composed of two tiny ancient buildings pushed together to make one comfortable home."
