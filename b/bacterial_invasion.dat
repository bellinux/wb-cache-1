5|$|Scientists {{initially}} {{hypothesized that}} acne represented {{a disease of}} the skin's hair follicle, and occurred due to blockage of the pore by sebum. During the 1880s, bacteria were observed by microscopy in skin samples affected by acne and were regarded as the causal agents of comedones, sebum production, and ultimately acne. During the mid-twentieth century, dermatologists realized that no single hypothesized factor (sebum, bacteria, or excess keratin) could completely explain the disease. This led to the current understanding that acne {{could be explained by}} a sequence of related events, beginning with blockage of the skin follicle by excessive dead skin cells, followed by <b>bacterial</b> <b>invasion</b> of the hair follicle pore, changes in sebum production, and inflammation.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{earliest}} challenges for ecologists has been to study the impact of invasive species on microbial communities. Although bacteria are fundamental in biological processes, current knowledge on invasion effects by aquatic nonpathogenic bacteria is still limited. Using pure cultures of diverse planktonic bacteria as model organisms at two different carbon concentration levels, we tested the response of an assembled community to the invasion by Limnohabitans planktonicus, an opportunistic bacterium, successful in freshwaters. The invader, introduced at the early stationary growth phase of the resident community, caused a strong decrement of the abundance of the dominant species. This was due to competition for nutrients and a potential allelopathic interaction. Simultaneously, resident species formerly unable to successfully compete within the community, thus potentially exposed to competitive exclusion, increased their abundances. The overall result of the invasion was preservation of species diversity, the higher the lower was the substrate content available.

40|$|Excessive {{neutrophil}} activation is a {{major component}} in septic lung injury. Neutrophil-derived DNA may form extracellular traps in response to <b>bacterial</b> <b>invasions.</b> The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the potential role of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in septic lung injury. Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice were treated with rhDNAse (5 mg/kg) after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Extracellular DNA was stained by Sytox green and NET formation was quantified by confocal microscopy and cell-free DNA in plasma, peritoneal cavity and lung. Blood, peritoneal fluid and lung tissue were harvested for analysis of neutrophil infiltration, NET levels, tissue injury as well as CXC chemokine and cytokine formation. We observed that CLP caused increased formation of NETs in the plasma, peritoneal cavity and lung. Administration of rhDNAse not only eliminated NET formation in the plasma, peritoneal cavity and bronchoalveolar space but also reduced lung edema and tissue damage 24 h after CLP induction. Moreover, treatment with rhDNAse decreased CLP-induced formation of CXC chemokines, IL- 6 and HMGB 1 in the plasma as well as CXC chemokines and IL- 6 in the lung. In vitro, we found that neutrophil-derived NETs had the capacity to stimulate secretion of CXCL 2, TNF-α and HMGB 1 from alveolar macrophages. Taken together, our findings show that NETs regulate pulmonary infiltration of neutrophils and tissue injury via formation of pro-inflammatory compounds in abdominal sepsis. Thus, we conclude that NETs exert a pro-inflammatory role in septic lung injury...|$|R
40|$|Fibronectin (Fn) is an {{important}} mediator of <b>bacterial</b> <b>invasions</b> and of persistent infections like that of Staphylococcus epidermis. Similar to many other types of cell-protein adhesion, the binding between Fn and S. epidermidis takes place under physiological shear rates. We investigated {{the dynamics of the}} interaction between individual living S. epidermidis cells and single Fn molecules under mechanical force by using the scanning force microscope. The mechanical strength of this interaction and the binding site in the Fn molecule were determined. The energy landscape of the binding/unbinding process was mapped, and the force spectrum and the association and dissociation rate constants of the binding pair were measured. The interaction between S. epidermidis cells and Fn molecules is compared with those of two other protein/ligand pairs known to mediate different dynamic states of adhesion of cells under a hydrodynamic flow: the firm adhesion mediated by biotin/avidin interactions, and the rolling adhesion, mediated by L-selectin/P-selectin glycoprotein ligand- 1 interactions. The inner barrier in the energy landscape of the Fn case characterizes a high-energy binding mode that can sustain larger deformations and for significantly longer times than the correspondent high-strength L-selectin/P-selectin glycoprotein ligand- 1 binding mode. The association kinetics of the former interaction is much slower to settle than the latter. On this basis, the observations made at the macroscopic scale by other authors of a strong lability of the bacterial adhesions mediated by Fn under high turbulent flow are rationalized at the molecular level...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Substantial {{amounts of}} data on cell signaling, metabolic, gene {{regulatory}} and other biological pathways have been accumulated in literature and electronic databases. Conventionally, this information is stored {{in the form of}} pathway diagrams and can be characterized as highly "compartmental" (i. e. individual pathways are not connected into more general networks). Current approaches for representing pathways are limited in their capacity to model molecular interactions in their spatial and temporal context. Moreover, the critical knowledge of cause-effect relationships among signaling events is not reflected by most conventional approaches for manipulating pathways. Results We have applied a semantic network (SN) approach to develop and implement a model for cell signaling pathways. The semantic model has mapped biological concepts to a set of semantic agents and relationships, and characterized cell signaling events and their participants in the hierarchical and spatial context. In particular, the available information on the behaviors and interactions of the PI 3 K enzyme family has been integrated into the SN environment and a cell signaling network in human macrophages has been constructed. A SN-application has been developed to manipulate the locations and the states of molecules and to observe their actions under different biological scenarios. The approach allowed qualitative simulation of cell signaling events involving PI 3 Ks and identified pathways of molecular interactions that led to known cellular responses as well as other potential responses during <b>bacterial</b> <b>invasions</b> in macrophages. Conclusions We concluded from our results that the semantic network is an effective method to model cell signaling pathways. The semantic model allows proper representation and integration of information on biological structures and their interactions at different levels. The reconstruction of the cell signaling network in the macrophage allowed detailed investigation of connections among various essential molecules and reflected the cause-effect relationships among signaling events. The simulation demonstrated the dynamics of the semantic network, where a change of states on a molecule can alter its function and potentially cause a chain-reaction effect in the system. </p...|$|R
