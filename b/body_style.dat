5|$|Three {{individual}} models, or grades, {{were available}} on the car's release in 2006; S, M, and G, in ascending order of price. They all shared the same five-door hatchback <b>body</b> <b>style</b> and turbocharged engine, but offered differing levels of options and standard equipment. In 2007 the base S model was given the new naturally aspirated powerplant, and was positioned below the two new grades, L and LX, whose engine it shared.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{introduced}} {{as a single}} sedan <b>body</b> <b>style,</b> the range expanded in 1979 to include a station wagon. From 1984, Holden began branding the flagship Commodore model as Holden Calais, with the Commodore Berlina introduced in 1984 gaining independent Holden Berlina nomenclature in 1988. Long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice derivatives and Commodore utility body variants followed in 1990. The third generation architecture spawned the most body styles, with a new Holden utility launched in 2000 (now officially as the Holden Ute), reborn Monaro coupé in 2001, four-door Holden Crewman utility and all-wheel drive (AWD) Holden Adventra crossover in 2003. Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) in 1987 began official modification of high performance variants of the Commodore and its derivatives, under its own nameplate.|$|E
5|$|Production reached 7128 cars {{over three}} {{distinct}} series. The factory only ever designated two, the Mark I and Mark II, {{but as the}} official Mark I production spanned the change in <b>body</b> <b>style</b> from the Series IV Alpine panels to the Series V panels, the later Mark I cars are generally designated Mark IA by Sunbeam Tiger enthusiasts. The Mark II Tiger, fitted with the larger Ford , was intended exclusively for export to America and was never marketed in the UK, although six right-hand drive models were sold to the Metropolitan Police for use in traffic patrols and high-speed pursuits; four more went to the owners of important Rootes dealerships.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 40) The {{influence of}} lateral visibility from the vehicle cabin on safety was evaluated {{by examining the}} differences in lane-change crashes of four-door and two-door <b>body</b> <b>styles</b> of the same vehicle models. These two vehicle styles were used because B-pillars on four-door models are farther forward, and thus nearer the fore-aft position of the driver. (Furthermore, the B-pillars on two-door models can be narrower, and some two-door models have no B-pillars at all.) To control for driver differences between these two <b>body</b> <b>styles,</b> going-straight-ahead crashes were used for comparison. The analysis used 2000 - 2003 North Carolina crash data, and considered the crash experience of four-door and two-door <b>body</b> <b>styles</b> for the same 10 vehicles for model years 1995 and newer. The main finding is that four-door <b>body</b> <b>styles</b> {{are more likely to}} be involved in lanechange crashes than are two-door <b>body</b> <b>styles</b> of the same vehicle models. This finding suggests that lateral visibility out of the vehicle cabin affects safety...|$|R

5|$|The Talbot Samba {{is a city}} car {{manufactured}} by the PSA Group in the former Simca factory in Poissy, France, and marketed under the short-lived modern-day Talbot brand from 1981 to 1986. Based on the Peugeot 104, {{it was the only}} Talbot not inherited from Chrysler Europe, engineered by PSA alone. It was also the last new Talbot to be launched, and the last in production. Its demise in 1986 was effectively the end of the Talbot brand for passenger cars. Launched initially as a three-door hatchback, it was also for some time the only small car available in a factory-ordered cabrio <b>body</b> <b>style,</b> and the most economical car in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Lexus {{production}} models are named alphanumerically using two-letter designations followed by three digits. The first letter indicates relative {{status in the}} Lexus model range (ranking), and the second letter refers to car <b>body</b> <b>style</b> or type (e.g. LS for 'luxury sedan'). The three digits indicate engine displacement in liters multiplied {{by a factor of}} one hundred (e.g. 350 for a 3.5 L engine). A space is used between the letters and numbers. The same letter may be used differently depending on the model; 'S' can refer to 'sedan' or 'sport' (e.g. in LS and SC), while 'X' refers to 'luxury utility vehicle' or SUV. On hybrids, the three digits refer to the combined gasoline-electric output. For certain models, a lower case letter placed after the alphanumeric designation indicates powerplant type ('h' for hybrid, 'd' for diesel, 't' for turbocharged), while capital letter(s) placed at the end indicates a class subtype (e.g. 'L' for long-wheelbase, 'C' for coupe, 'AWD' for all-wheel drive). On F marque models, the two-letter designation and the letter 'F' are used with no numbers or hyphens (e.g. IS F).|$|E
5|$|The LS 430 {{first went}} on sale in the U.S. with an initial base price of US$55,000, ranging up to US$70,000 when fully equipped. At the high end, the LS 430's pricing encroached on European rivals as Lexus became {{increasingly}} able to command higher price premiums for its vehicles. Sales for the LS 430 surpassed the previous generation, and production exceeded 140,000 units. The LS 430 was produced until July 2006, marking the last occasion the Lexus flagship was produced in a single <b>body</b> <b>style.</b> In Japan, the equivalent Toyota Celsior was also sold from August 2000 until March 2006, when the long-awaited introduction of Lexus Japan saw the arrival of new generation Lexus models. XF30 design patents were filed by Toyota in domestic Japan, on 8 March 1999 at the Japan Patent Office under patent number 1080448.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced in Japan in September 1978, the T130 series Corona {{adopted a}} boxier design over the {{outgoing}} T100/110/120 series.

The T130 series {{was available in}} a wide range of <b>body</b> <b>styles</b> across various markets including a four-door Sedan, two-door hardtop coupe, four-door wagon and new five-door liftback, which featured a 40:60 split fold rear seat.

5|$|Though the {{instrument}} had been originally {{designed for use}} in a church, Hammond realized that the amateur home market was a far more lucrative business, and started manufacturing spinet organs in the late 1940s. Outside of the United States, they were manufactured in greater numbers than the consoles, and hence were more widely used. Several different types of M series instruments were produced between 1948 and 1964; they contained two 44-note manuals with one set of drawbars each, and a 12-note pedalboard. The M model was produced from 1948 to 1951, the M-2 from 1951 to 1955, and the M-3 from 1955 to 1964. The M series was replaced by the M-100 series in 1961, which used a numbering system to identify the <b>body</b> <b>style</b> and finish as used on earlier console series. It included the same manuals as the M, but increased the pedalboard size to 13 notes, stretching a full octave, and included a number of presets.|$|E
