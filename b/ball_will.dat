5|$|The {{special teams}} unit is {{responsible}} for all kicking plays. The special teams unit of the team {{in control of the}} <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> try and execute field goal (FG) attempts, punts and kickoffs, while the opposing team's unit will aim to block or return them.|$|E
5|$|In March 2017 it was {{announced}} by the MCC that the law on handled the ball would be completely removed and subsumed into the law on obstructing the field. This means {{that the act of}} handling the <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> still result in the batsman's dismissal, but will now always be recorded as obstructing the field. The new law is due to come into effect on 1 October 2017.|$|E
5|$|Goalkeepers {{should be}} wary of dummying, lob shots and skip or bounce shots. Dummying is where players fake shots, leading keepers {{to come out of}} the water too early. This can cause the goalkeeper to come up too early and have to go back down for energy. The lob shot is where a field player {{attempts}} to put the ball over where the goalkeeper's hands can reach. This usually happens either if the goalkeeper is out of position from the dummies or if they are too far out from the goal. The goalkeeper should swim back to try to block it, as it is nowhere near as fast as the power shot. The bounce or skip shot is where a player propels the ball at the water with enough force to make it bounce or skim along the water. It can take the goalkeeper by surprise as they cannot predict the direction the <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> go.|$|E
50|$|Wide <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> {{be called}} as with {{orthodox}} cricket rules.|$|R
5000|$|Flies {{further than}} other <b>balls,</b> these <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> {{typically}} fly the furthest.|$|R
5000|$|Less run {{than other}} <b>balls,</b> these <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> {{typically}} {{have the highest}} accuracy.|$|R
25|$|The {{rules for}} the tournament deviate {{from those in the}} laws of cricket where any no <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> be {{followed}} by a free hit.|$|E
25|$|The upper {{panel in}} the image at right shows a ball in {{circular}} motion on a banked curve. The curve is banked at an angle θ from the horizontal, and {{the surface of the}} road is considered to be slippery. The objective is to find what angle the bank must have so the ball does not slide off the road. Intuition tells us that, on a flat curve with no banking at all, the <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> simply slide off the road; while with a very steep banking, the <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> slide to the center unless it travels the curve rapidly.|$|E
25|$|In reality, due to inelastic collisions, {{the tennis}} <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> {{increase}} its velocity and rebound height by a smaller factor, but still will bounce faster and {{higher than it}} would have on its own.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> be 2+1/2 to 2+5/8 in in {{diameter}} and 1+3/4 oz in weight.|$|R
60|$|LINA. [coming down] Not in the least. But billiard <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> {{do quite}} as well.|$|R
50|$|Starting no {{earlier than}} June 2016, all {{lacrosse}} <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> {{have to meet}} the new NOCSAE Standard.|$|R
25|$|Tacklers' {{rights to}} the <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> be {{restricted}} to 180 degrees, instead of 360 as in the current laws. This makes it nearly impossible for a defender to steal the ball while making a tackle.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, the {{corridor}} of uncertainty {{is an area where}} a cricket ball can pitch during a delivery: a narrow line on and just outside a batsman's off stump. The name is derived from the opinion that this is the area in which a batsman struggles most to determine whether to play forward or back, or to leave the delivery. If a batsman leaves the ball, there's a chance the <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> turn inward and either bowl him or hit him with an increased chance of leg before wicket. If a batsman plays the ball, there's a chance the <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> go to the outside instead, leading to an outside edge that can be easily caught.|$|E
25|$|The scroll <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> {{eventually}} become clogged with dirt and require cleaning. While there are methods {{to clean the}} ball without dismantling the mouse some users have complained that the Mighty Mouse is difficult to clean because the scroll ball mechanism is hard to take apart.|$|E
5000|$|Finitely {{generated}} {{groups of}} subexponential growth are amenable. A suitable subsequence of <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> provide a Følner sequence.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> {{fly out of}} {{the playing}} surface. These balls are out for that round {{and can not be}} {{replaced}} while the top is still spinning.|$|R
50|$|Step 1: 1 ball of pot 2 {{is drawn}} to pot 1 and two balls of pot 2 are drawn to pot 3 (the <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> not be opened).|$|R
25|$|Sixes and fours are automatic, {{there is}} no need to run if they deem the <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> surely touch or go past the {{boundary}} rope. If the batsmen decide to run, they will be cancelled off, and four/six runs will be added to the score.|$|E
25|$|Swing bowling {{can also}} be roughly {{categorised}} as early swing or late swing, corresponding to when in the trajectory the <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> change direction – the later the ball swings, the less chance the batter has of adjusting his/her shot {{to account for the}} swing.|$|E
25|$|If the {{cue ball}} hits an object ball {{at an angle}} and has follow on it, the cue <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> first travel on the tangent line and then parabolically arc forward from the tangent line in the {{direction}} of cue ball travel. By the same token, when such impact is made and the cue ball has draw on it, the cue <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> first travel on the tangent line and then parabolically arc backward from the tangent line in the opposite direction of cue ball travel. Whether follow or draw is on the cue ball, the faster the cue ball is traveling at the moment of impact, the farther it will travel on the tangent line before arcing forward or backward.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{began with}} a prologue as the narrator {{explains}} to the viewers about how the Dragon Balls, seven orange balls with different number of red stars on each one, were forged and scattered throughout the Earth. It is said that when all seven are gathered together, the Eternal Dragon named Shenron; custodian of the Dragon <b>Balls,</b> <b>will</b> rise from his fiery lair and grant whoever summoned him any one wish. Afterwards, the Dragon <b>Balls</b> <b>will</b> again scatter {{all over the world}} while Shenron returns to his lair until another [...] "brave or foolish soul" [...] will find and reunite these magical balls.|$|R

5000|$|The scoring can be {{expressed}} in the formula [...] "Y=X(X-1)". X represents the number of balls grouped together, Y is the resulting score. For example an elimination of 16 <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> result in 240 points (240=16(16-1)).|$|R
25|$|Reverse swing is a {{phenomenon}} that makes the ball swing {{in the opposite direction}} to that usually produced by the orientation of the shiny and rough sides of the ball. When the ball is reverse swinging, the <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> swing towards the shiny side. Balls that reverse swing move much later and much more sharply than those swinging conventionally, both factors increasing the difficulty the batsman will have in trying to hit the ball. At speeds of over 90mph a <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> always exhibit reverse swing, but as roughness increases on the leading side, the speed at which reverse swing occurs decreases. This means that an older ball {{is more likely to be}} delivered with reverse swing as its surface will have been roughened through use.|$|E
25|$|If {{the ball}} is moving much more rapidly than it was spinning, {{translational}} friction will dominate. The ball's angular velocity will be increased after impact, but its horizontal velocity will be decreased. The <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> not exceed its original height and will keep spinning in the same direction.|$|E
25|$|Newton's third law {{of action}} and {{reaction}} states that if the string exerts an inward centripetal force on the ball, the <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> exert an equal but outward reaction upon the string, shown in the free body diagram of the string (lower panel) as the reactive centrifugal force.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I am {{what you}} would call a fine shot," [...] said Attwater. [...] "It is faith; I believe my <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> go true; if I were to miss once, it would spoil me for nine months." ...|$|R
5000|$|The stunt was {{intended}} {{to draw attention to}} the struggles of the Karen people. [...] "I am leaving for Burma, these <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> help the Karen people," [...] he said as he walked down the steps with balls bouncing around him.|$|R
3000|$|... {{the case}} of a general SOLA can be treated {{adapting}} the arguments valid for the energy case along the lines described in Sect.  14.4 for Theorem  15. In the rest of the proof all the <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> be centred at the point [...]...|$|R
25|$|A caged metal ball may be {{arranged}} {{at the edge}} of an orifice. Upon seismic shock, the <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> roll into the orifice, sealing it to prevent gas flow. The ball may later be reset by the use of an external magnet. This device will respond only to ground motion.|$|E
25|$|If a {{delivery}} satisfies {{the criteria for}} both a No Ball and a Wide, the call and penalty of No <b>Ball</b> <b>will</b> take precedence. Like with No Ball, a batsman may attempt to score runs off the delivery which will be assessed {{in addition to the}} penalty run as wides and extras.|$|E
25|$|If {{the ball}} is {{spinning}} much more rapidly than it was moving, rotational friction will dominate. The ball's angular velocity will be reduced after impact, but its horizontal velocity will be increased. The <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> be propelled forward but will not exceed its original height, and will keep spinning in the same direction.|$|E
2500|$|René {{blames the}} {{susceptibility}} {{of people to}} religious dogma with a return to prudishness {{and the proliferation of}} special interest groups, and jokes that censorship has succeeded in making people so stupid that [...] "bowling <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> soon be printed with the instructions For External Use Only".|$|R
25|$|In the {{previous}} tournament, {{the first three}} WODIs counted towards qualification. However, for this tournament, the International Cricket Council (ICC) requested that additional matches are played as Women's Twenty20 Internationals (WT20Is). Inline with the updated ICC rules, two <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> {{be used for the}} first time in WODI matches.|$|R
50|$|Bricks and bowling <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> {{float on}} the surface of mercury thanks to it having a density 13.5 times that of water. Equally, a solid mercury bowling ball would weigh around 50 pounds and, if it could be kept cold enough, would float {{on the surface}} of liquid gold.|$|R
