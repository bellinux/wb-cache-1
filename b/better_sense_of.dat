Many groups {{retained}} primitive characteristics, such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups, including modern birds (Aves). While the earliest forms, such as Archaeopteryx and Jeholornis, retained the long bony tails of their ancestors, the tails of more advanced avialans were shortened {{with the advent of the}} pygostyle bone in the group Pygostylia. In the late Cretaceous, around 95 million years ago, the ancestor of all modern birds also evolved a <b>better</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{are similar}} in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong {{flexible}} body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a <b>better</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes {{the use of a}} variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.|$|E

The colors were made richer and bolder, the spider emblem was given more elegant lines and enlarged, the eye-lenses were somewhat smaller, and the muscle suit underneath {{was made into}} pieces, to give a <b>better</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> movement. The helmet Maguire wore under his mask was also improved, with better movement for the false jaw and magnetic eye pieces, which were easier to remove.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} {{youth of}} this field {{means there is}} still much progress to be made in characterizing all modifications to the transcriptome and elucidating their mechanisms of action. Once these questions are answered and biologists have a <b>better</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the amount of variation in RNA modification, the focus will turn to each modification’s biological function. This has already been investigated in a select few proteins such as adenosine deaminase, which acts on RNA (ADAR). ADAR has been shown to affect antibody production and the innate immune system as well as transcripts encoding important receptors for the central nervous system. This plurality in function has caused some scientists to speculate that the epitransciptome may be even more expansive than the better defined epigenome.|$|E

40|$|Distributed Gesture {{recognition}} {{rather than}} centralized processing is of importance in distributed sensor arrays embedded within networked systems. We have implemented a gesture recognition algorithm on a smart wall system with distributed sensing using capacitive touch sensors. Each node records a sense event and shares {{it with other}} nodes in the network. Then each node builds up a chain vector array and compares it with a reference gestures {{to find out the}} alphabet drawn on the wall. We studied the effect of gesture speed and number of vectors on gesture recognition and found that as the number of vectors in a gesture increases, the recognition becomes more reliable. A slower gesture speed allows for <b>better</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> touch and hence also leads to better gesture recognition. We also implemented a Hardware abstraction Architecture based on the TinyOS operating system to achieve the goal of making the program platform independent...|$|R

25|$|The 2000s saw {{the growth}} of digital {{distribution}} {{and the arrival of}} smart phones and tablet computers, with touch-screen interfaces well-suited to point-and-click adventure games. The introduction of larger and more powerful touch screen devices like the iPad allowed for more detailed graphics, more precise controls, and a <b>better</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> immersion and interactivity compared to personal computer or console versions. In gaming hardware, the handheld Nintendo DS and subsequent units included a touch-screen, and the Nintendo Wii console with its Wii Remote allowed players to control a cursor through motion control. These new platforms helped decrease the cost of bringing an adventure game to market, providing an avenue to re-release older, less graphically advanced games The Secret of Monkey Island, King's Quest and Space Quest and attracting a new audience to adventure games.|$|E
25|$|A {{black bear}} has better {{eyesight}} and a <b>better</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> hearing compared to humans. Their keenest sense {{is the sense}} of smell, which is about seven times greater than a dog's. Black bears are excellent and strong swimmers, doing so for pleasure and to feed (largely on fish). They regularly climb trees to feed, escape enemies, and hibernate. Half of bear species are habitually arboreal (the most arboreal species, the American and Asian black bears and the sun bear, being fairly closely related). Their arboreal abilities tend to decline with age. Black bears may be active at any time of the day or night although they mainly forage by night. Bears living near human habitations tend to be more extensively nocturnal, and bears living near brown bears tend to be more extensively diurnal. Their social behavior is somewhat similar to that of canids.|$|E

25|$|The {{striped hyena}} competes with the gray wolf in the Middle East and central Asia. In the latter area, a great {{portion of the}} hyena's diet stems from wolf-killed carcasses. The striped hyena is {{dominant}} over the wolf on a one-to-one basis, though wolves in packs can displace single hyenas from carcasses. Both species {{have been known to}} share dens on occasion. On rare occasions, Striped Hyenas are also known to travel with and live amongst wolf packs, with each doing the other no harm. Both predators may benefit from this unusual alliance, as the hyenas have <b>better</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> smell and greater strength, and the wolves may be better at tracking large prey. Red foxes may compete with striped hyenas on large carcasses. Red foxes may give way to hyenas on unopened carcasses, as the latter's stronger jaws can easily tear open flesh which is too tough for foxes. Foxes may harass hyenas, using their smaller size and greater speed to avoid the hyena's attacks. Sometimes, foxes seem to deliberately torment hyenas even when there is no food at stake. Some foxes may mistime their attacks, and are killed.|$|R

500|$|Overall, the MediEvil {{series has}} {{received}} positive to mixed reviews from critics. MediEvil and MediEvil 2 were mostly praised upon release, with the atmosphere, visuals and music of both games being the prominently commended aspects. Chris Roper of IGN praised the game's sense of humour and unique presentation, but was sceptical concerning the game's [...] "sloppy" [...] controls, [...] "disjointed" [...] level designs {{and noted that}} the game's graphics did not age well over time, {{in comparison to the}} graphically superior PSP remake. Joe Fielder of GameSpot credited the first MediEvil for its original look and number of unique puzzles, but criticised the camera work. Reviewing MediEvil 2, Doug Perry of IGN praised the graphical advancements of the game, noticing that the sharper detail brings out a more [...] "sophisticated feel" [...] to the story and the new addition of cutscenes create a <b>better</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> continuity and story. Shawn Sparks of Game Revolution similarly praised the improved graphics of the second game, noting that smooth frame rate and sharper graphics brought out the original PlayStation's power despite nearing the end of its lifespan.

500|$|For the game's artistic style, {{the team}} drew {{on a variety}} of influences: the work of film {{directors}} David Cronenberg, David Fincher, David Lynch and Alfred Hitchcock, along with films similar to the 1990 psychological thriller/horror film Jacob's Ladder, and painters such as Francis Bacon, Rembrandt and Andrew Wyeth. Early in the project, they studied the 1996 video game Tomb Raiders creation of 3D environments. Other influences on the game included the 1992 survival horror video game Alone in the Dark, the first Silent Hill game, and the Japanese comic Whirr by Morohashi. While working on the character designs, Sato and his team sketched human faces and various expressions. To gain a <b>better</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the characters' facial structures, they drew the characters' profiles from various angles, before creating wire-frame models, each consisting of six thousand polygons; they then completed the model with textures. Data for the character animation was taken through motion capture, and using Softimage, they animated the characters. Masahiro Ito designed the monsters in Silent Hill 2; [...] "soured flesh" [...] was the concept behind their appearance. The monsters were also to incorporate [...] "an element of humanity". For the most part, the monsters reflect the protagonist's subconscious. For example, the monster Pyramid Head was based on the executioners of the town's fictional history and is intended to be a punisher for James. Two exceptions to this theme are the [...] "Abstract Daddy", a reflection of Angela's subconscious and memories, and the [...] "Creepers", which are also seen in the first game.|$|E

But given the context, Here We Go Again is certainly enjoyable to some scale." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album 3 stars out of five, saying [...] "Lovato has chops and spunk akin to a fellow Texas pop singer, though her voice doesn't churn with Kelly Clarkson's gutsy heart yet." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{moving picture}} (TV) {{the number of}} frames scanned per second {{is known as the}} frame rate. The higher the frame rate, the <b>better</b> the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> motion. But again, {{increasing}} the frame rate introduces technical difficulties. So the frame rate is fixed at 25 (System B/G) or 29.97 (System M). To increase the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> motion it is customary to scan the very same frame in two consecutive phases. In each phase only half of the lines are scanned; only the lines with odd numbers in the first phase and only the lines with even numbers in the second phase. Each scan is known as a field. So the field rate is two times the frame rate.|$|R
