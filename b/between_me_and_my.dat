500|$|Kiedis' {{feelings}} of alienation from his bandmates {{led him to}} feel that the city of Los Angeles was his only companion: [...] "I felt an unspoken bond <b>between</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." [...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city I live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter how sad or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison." [...] The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: [...] "I don't ever want to feel / Like I did that day / Take me to the place I love", [...] "the place" [...] meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.|$|E
500|$|In {{hopes of}} averting the lean years that troubled most {{expansion}} teams, George Imlach, the Sabres first coach and General Manager, attempted {{to build a}} high-scoring club to excite the local hockey fans. Perreault {{was regarded as a}} smooth skater and tremendous stickhandler. [...] Perreault was chosen to be the franchise player around which a team could be built and succeed. [...] Although Martin and Perreault had played two years together with the Montreal Junior Canadiens (Perreault even lived with Martin's family during the 1969–70 season), they had never played on the same line before being paired in Buffalo. [...] Since Martin {{was one of the few}} who could keep up with Perreault as a skater they were paired together after the Sabres drafted Martin. [...] It was very clear during the 1971–72 season that Perreault and Martin were a natural pairing. [...] Sabres coach Joe Crozier felt the two just needed a third player who would stay high and check. [...] Sabres coach quickly teamed Robert with Perreault and Martin after the trade. [...] The two players complemented Perreault and became a dynamic combination that dazzled fans. [...] They were dubbed the French Connection by writer Lee Coppola as a reference to the Academy Award-winning film and their heritage via the Buffalo Auditorium message board. [...] The pair played together as a regular line through the 1974–75 season. [...] At times, they were split up during the last four seasons. [...] When they played together they often faced the opposition's top defensive lineups. [...] Since the trio were tremendous skating scoring threats these opponents would concentrate on checking them and staying on top of them. [...] For example, against the Montreal Canadiens Bob Gainey's line would oppose them. [...] Rick Martin once said about this line [...] "I had Jimmy Roberts <b>between</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> shadow." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lorde focused her {{discussion}} of difference {{not only on}} differences between groups of women but between conflicting differences within the individual. [...] "I am defined as other in every group I'm part of," [...] she declared. [...] "The outsider, both strength and weakness. Yet without community there is certainly no liberation, no future, only the most vulnerable and temporary armistice <b>between</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> oppression".

Such a display is illegal in Germany, and CNBC fired Layfield {{as a result of the}} controversy.
