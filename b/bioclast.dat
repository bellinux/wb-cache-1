40|$|Introduction According to {{different}} paleontological and paleomagnetic studies, Iran {{was part of}} the Gondwana during the Permian. The Permian lithostratigraphic units in the Alborz-Azerbaijan are introduced as Doroud, Ruteh and Nesen Formations. The Ruteh Formation, the second depositional cycle of the Permian in the Alborz Basin, have been studied at two stratigraphic sections in the Central Alborz. The Sangsar section located on the south flank of the Central Alborz, 1 km northwest of Mahdishahr city and the Makaroud section located on the north flank of the Central Alborz, about 37 km south of Chalous city. The thickness of the Ruteh Formation at the Sangsar section is 106 m and at the Makaroud section is 222 m. At the Sangsar section the Ruteh Formation is underlain by the Doroud Formation with gradual contact and is overlain by a lateritic horizon. At the Makaroud section the Ruteh Formation disconformably overlies the Doroud Formation and the upper boundary is faulted and the Chalous Formation overlies the Ruteh Formation at this section. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analysis microfacies, interpret depositional environments and delineate relative sea level changes of the Ruteh Formation. Other researchers studied the Ruteh Formation at different sections in the Alborz Basin believe that the carbonate sediments of this formation have been deposited in a homoclinal carbonate ramp and consist of two-three 3 rd order depositional sequences. But no sedimentological studies have been done at the selected sections in this study.   Material & Methods Two stratigraphic sections of the Ruteh Formation have been selected, measuted and sampled. One hundred sixty three samples (fifty seven samples from Sangsar and one hundred six samples from Makaroud section)  were collected and thin sections were prepared from all samples. Afew samples were collected from lower and upper formations. Thin sections were stained with potassium ferricyanide and alizarin-red S solution according to Dickson (1965) method. The grain and matrix percentages were estimated using visual percentage charts of Bacelle and Bosellini (1965). Dunham (1962) classiﬁcation were used for carbonate facies nomenclature. Based on lithological and textural characteristics, fossil content, abiotic allochems, facies succession and their comparision with well studied environments by Flugel (2010), microfacies and their subenvironments have been identified. In this study investigation of relative sea level changes is on the basis of field observations and facies analysis. Based on the vertical succession of microfacies and sedimentary paleoenvironmental features, Systems tracts and sedimentary sequences have been recognized. Discussion of Results & Conclusions Field and petrographic studies at the Sangsar and Makaroud sections, indicate that the Ruteh Formation sediments consist of 19 carbonate microfacies and one siliciclastic petrofacies that during the Middle Permian times deposited in tidal flat to open marine facies belts of a bioclastic homoclinal carbonate ramp on the southern passive margin of the Paleotethys located on the northern Gondwana Supercontinent in a tropical region. Tidal flat facies belt includes: Dolomitic mudstone, lime mudstone to sandy lime mudstone, pelloid intraclast packstone and one quartzarenite siliciclastic petrofacies. Lagoon facies belt includes: <b>bioclast</b> mudstone, dasycladacea wackestone, foraminifera pelloid wackestone, <b>bioclast</b> pelloid wackestone,  bioclast tubiphytes wackestone, <b>bioclast</b> algal wackestone/packstone. Shoal facies belt includes: ooid pelloid packstone/grainstone, <b>bioclast</b> pelloid packstone/grainstone, pelloid <b>bioclast</b> grainstone and algal packstone/grainstone. Open marine facies belt includes: tubiphytes gymnocodiacea wackestone, gymnocodiacea packstone, <b>bioclast</b> gymnocodiacea wackestone, sponge spicule <b>bioclast</b> wackestone, crinoid mudstone/wackestone and <b>bioclast</b> mudstone.   The Ruteh Formation at both sections deposited mainly in inner ramp environment but thickness of the sediments deposited in open marine facies belt at the Sangsar section is more than the Makaroud section. The main sediments constituents including algae, foraminifera and metazoans show different distribution in the various subenvironments of the carbonate platform. This studies resulted in identifying two low rank sequences at the Sangsar section and three low rank sequences at the Makaroud section. Sequence boundaries are identified by disconformities, volcanics, paleosol horizons, emergence of tidal flat microfacies and microfacies that are indicative of maximum sea level fall in each sequence. The deepest microfacies are also regarded as maximum flooding surfaces. Deposits of the Ruteh Formation at both sections is part of the Transpecos Supercycle (Absaroka II Subsequence). The most deepening of the sea water occurs in the middle parts of the Ruteh Formation and general trend of the sea level changes in this formation is accordant with the global sea level changes during the Permian...|$|E

The biogenic accumulation with high content of organic matter and phosphorous was a prime source of the phosphate which formed the phosphate deposits of the Mazıdağ—Derik area. Commonly, currents transported the phosphatic sediments laterally, forming parallel and low angle cross laminations. In some cases, the sea floor was uplifted after upwelling periods. Conse-quently, some phosphate beds underwent karstification, giving rise to phoscretes and silcretes. Ground water percoalating into the karstic realm caused phosphate replacement of many carbonate grains of the shallow water limestone facies. These complex events resulted in the formation of three basic phosphate peloid types in the Mazıdağ-Derik phosphate sequence, which are classified to the following origin of peloids: (1) in situ precipitation; (2) abrasion of phosphatized intraclast and <b>bioclast</b> and (3) phosphate micri-tization of fish bones.

The transgressive systems tracts mainly comprises of open marine facies including sponge spicule, oligosteginid, echinoid and benthic foraminifera, while the highstand systems tracts mainly consists of shoal facies rich in <b>bioclast,</b> and restricted and semi-restricted lagoon facies rich in porcellaneous and hyaline benthic foraminifera and peloid.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Raine Island {{is a small}} vegetated coral cay that is {{capped by}} recent insular {{phosphate}} rock. On the northeastern shore, phos-phate rock also extends into the intertidal zone, where it is juxtaposed against calcareous beachrock. A petrological and isotopic study was carried out on the phosphate rock in order to clarify some of the un-certainties concerning the genesis of insular phosphate rocks in general and on Raine Island in particular. The main phosphate mineral is dahllite (carbonate hydroxyapatite), which occurs as microlaminated grain coatings and as a <b>bioclast</b> replacement. Minor pore-filling whit-lockite (b tricalcium phosphate) was recorded in one sample. Organic carbon is intimately associated with phosphate cement and accounts for color variations between microlaminae. Phosphate d 18 Op (SMOW) values range from 14. 4 to 16. 6 ‰, indicating that phosphatic porewa-ters were entirely fresh and had not undergone evaporative 18 O en-richment. Phosphate cement records the passage of both downward-percolating near-surface porewater and seaward-moving groundwater at or close to the freshwater–saltwater interface. Intertidal phosphatic rock on the northeastern shore is a rare example of a lithified, inter-tidal tropical beach sand deposit with a definite fresh-water origin...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCoquina beachrock, with a {{thickness}} of 10 m and an exposed surface area covering 3. 4 km 2, is well developed {{along the southern}} coast of Haishan Island {{on the east coast}} of Guangdong Province, South China. Part of the deposit not treated in this study also extends under the surface of the sea. The coquina beachrock was deposited in a large embayment semi-enclosed by palaeocoastal hills and islands, but with good marine circulation. Holocene strata on Haishan Island demonstrate a mixed carbonate/siliciclastic regime in a series of fining- and deepening-upward shelly limestone successions. Mass accumulations of whole and fragmented mollusc shells are the most remarkable features expressed throughout the series. Coralline red algae are commonly found overgrowing the bivalve <b>bioclasts.</b> Other <b>bioclasts</b> include gastropods, coralline red algae, bryozoans, foraminifera, and scleractinian coral. Cement is well developed within the interstices formed by the <b>bioclasts,</b> showing two or three generations of development. On both a qualitative and quantitative basis, the consecutive coquina series document an overall shallowing-upward pattern of beachrock deposition, which was strongly influenced by marine transgression on Haishan Island. Dating by AMS 14 C indicates an age in the Middle to early Late Holocene for these coquina beachrock deposits. Siliciclasts incorporated within the beachrock deposits mainly consist of quartz grains. Not fully hardened, the binding cement is high in calcium carbonate, including aragonite mud, fibrous aragonite and granular calcite. Such carbonate deposits dominated by mollusc <b>bioclasts</b> with quartz grains indicate a pattern of littoral sedimentation. The massive coquina beachrock on the southern coast of Haishan Island formed during Middle to early Late Holocene time, and represents a highstand of sea level from 4000 BP to 2800 BP with short-lived and rapid sea level fall...|$|R
