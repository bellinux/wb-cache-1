500|$|McKinsey & Company's founder, James O. McKinsey, {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} budget planning as a management framework in his fifth book <b>Budgetary</b> <b>Control</b> in 1922.

It was {{also known as the}} Banker's Survey, because McKinsey's clients who used it in the 1930s were predominantly banks. After the Wagner Act gave certain rights to employees to organize into unions in 1935, McKinsey started consulting corporations on employee relations.

500|$|Given {{that the}} ZWZ focused on {{military}} {{aspects of the}} struggle, its civilian dimension was less clearly defined and developed more slowly—a situation exacerbated by the complex political discussions that were then unfolding between politicians in occupied Poland and the government in exile (first located in Paris, and {{after the fall of}} France, in London). Sikorski's government opted for a much more democratic procedure then the less democratic prewar Sanacja regime. The National Council (Rada Narodowa) was formed by the government in exile in December 1939, including representatives from different Polish political factions. Meanwhile, in occupied Poland, a major step toward the development of the organization's civilian structure was taken in late February 1940, when the ZWZ established its local version of the National Council, the Political Consultative Committee (Polityczny Komitet Porozumiewawczy, PKP). The structures in occupied Poland maintained close communication with the government in exile, through radio communications and [...] "hundreds, if not thousands" [...] of couriers, such as Jan Karski. One of the most significant developments of 1940 was the creation of the office of Government Delegation for Poland (Delegatura Rządu na Kraj), with Cyryl Ratajski (nominated on 3 December) as the first Delegate; this event marked the official beginning of the Underground State (Ratajski would be followed by Jan Piekałkiewicz, Jan Stanisław Jankowski and Stefan Korboński). The post of the Delegate could be seen as equivalent to that of a Deputy Prime Minister (particularly since the legislation of 1944). Unlike the GRP and PKP, which operated alongside the military structures but had no influence over them, the Delegation had <b>budgetary</b> <b>control</b> over the military. The Delegation was to oversee the military, and recreate the civilian administration.|$|E

40|$|Recent work [e. g. Simons, R., 1995. Levers of Control: How Managers use Innovative Control Systems to Drive Strategic Renewal. Harvard Business School Press; Simons, R., 1999. Performance Measurement and Control Systems for Implementing Strategy. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ] {{suggests}} that traditional management control {{systems such as}} <b>budgetary</b> <b>controls</b> are being 'embedded' within a wider control framework which top management may use to influence and support both the formation and implementation of strategy. A further stream of literature points to significant changes in current organizational arrangements and management practices, involving boundary-spanning activities and the greater use of multi-functional project teams, which problematise notions of cybernetics, individual-level controllability and management-by-exception on which traditional approaches to management control are based [Ansari, S. L., 1979. Towards an open systems approach to budgeting. Acc. Organ. Society 4 (3), 149 - 161]. Consequently, managers increasingly find themselves having to balance their continued exposure to traditional <b>budgetary</b> <b>controls</b> and imperatives which measure progress towards predetermined financial targets, with the more broadly based but no less intense demands imposed {{by the need to}} pursue strategic initiatives. Drawing on evidence garnered from an intensive case study of a multinational organization, this paper explores the ways in which these potentially incompatible roles are reconciled within a framework of management control. Findings indicate that, while elements of the formal control structure, in particular <b>budgetary</b> <b>controls,</b> remain wedded to notions of cybernetics, individual-level accountability and management-by-exception, managers in attempts to pursue their strategic forcing roles become involved in interdependencies and team working which blur line responsibilities and accountabilities. The study {{suggests that}} the resulting tensions and issues created by these competing concepts tend to be managed through formally directed procedures, and informal channels of social interaction, both hierarchically and horizontally. In particular, the study highlights how managers appear able to address, through reference to the company's broad framework of control, the accepted lack of controllability by a variety of 'negotiated' arrangements for 'sharing' the discharge of individual accountabilities...|$|R

50|$|Even {{though the}} {{computers}} are recognised as “change agents” in Stage I, Nolan acknowledged that many users become alienated by computing. Because of this, Stage II is characterised by a managerial {{need to explain}} the potential of computer applications to alienated users. This leads {{to the adoption of}} computers in a range of different areas. A problem that arises in Stage II is that project and <b>budgetary</b> <b>controls</b> are not developed. Unavoidably, this leads to a saturation of existing computer capacity and more sophisticated computer systems being obtained. System sophistication requires employing specialised professionals. Due to the shortage of qualified individuals, implementing these employees results in high salaries. The budget for computer organisation rises significantly and causes concern for management. Although the price of Stage II is high, it is evident that planning and control of computer systems is necessary.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This chapter {{reviews and}} critiques {{quantitative}} research {{that focuses on}} the relation between management control systems (MCS) and strategy. This quantitative research typically relies on survey evidence, and to a lesser extent, interviews and archival data. The focus of research up to the late 1990 s was on the fit between the design of MCS and strategy. Controls included cost <b>controls,</b> <b>budgetary</b> <b>controls,</b> and performance evaluation and reward systems. These controls are usually related to business strategy. However, some papers studied oper-ational strategies, such as quality, manufacturing flexibility, and product-related strategies. Recently, more complex characterizations have emerged that focus on the role of MCS in influencing strategic change, through interactive controls, and balanced scorecard approaches, which integrate a range of measures to enable strategic outcomes. It is concluded that our knowledge of the relationship between MCS and strategy is still somewhat limited. The chapter finishes with an outline of methodological limitations and areas for future research. 1...|$|R

The sample comprises member companies of the Association of Construction Industries of the State of Parana (PR-SINDUSCON) operating in the segment of residential buildings. The data were collected by means of questionnaires sent to 317 SINDUSCON members. 69 were returned and 54 used for our research. Exploratory Factorial Analysis of the data allowed us to identify two groups of cost management practices. Analyses suggest equality between the adopted cost management practices and the Cost Control Planning (CCP) practices among the companies of the Group 1, regardless of the generic strategy adopted. The companies of the Group 2 that adopted the differentiation strategy seem to use mainly the ACR cost management practice.

25|$|Sadat {{took several}} {{measures}} to decentralize {{power to the}} provinces and towns. Governors acquired more authority under Law Number 43 of 1979, which reduced the administrative and <b>budgetary</b> <b>controls</b> {{of the central government}} over the provinces. The elected councils acquired, at least formally, the right to approve or disapprove the local budget. In an effort to reduce local demands on the central treasury, local government was given wider powers to raise local taxes. But local representative councils became vehicles of pressure for government spending, and the soaring deficits of local government bodies had to be covered by the central government. Local government was encouraged to enter into joint ventures with private investors, and these ventures stimulated an alliance between government officials and the local rich that paralleled the infitah alliance at the national level. Under Mubarak decentralization and local autonomy became more of a reality, and local policies often reflected special local conditions. Thus, officials in Upper Egypt often bowed to the powerful Islamic movement there, while those in the port cities struck alliances with importers.|$|R

40|$|A hubris {{theory of}} {{entrepreneurship}} suggests that financial forecasts are often {{informed by the}} use of heuristic methods prone to overconfidence. While overconfidence can be advantageous during the start-up phase, it is also linked to overoptimistic forecasts, non-optimal outcomes and firm failure. This paper uses a data set from 203 micro and small firms operating in North West Italy where overconfidence is measured as the difference between budget estimates and actual results for Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA), owners’ equity and borrowing costs. These measures are employed to identify the extent of overconfidence by entrepreneurs in their financial forecasts and to analyse any relationship between overconfidence and the characteristics of the entrepreneur and the firm. A further probit analysis is employed to investigate any association between overconfident financial forecasts and subsequent firm failure. The results are consistent with the hypotheses, suggesting that the majority of entrepreneurs are prone to overconfident budgetary forecasts that are directly associated with firm failure. Such overconfidence is mitigated by an entrepreneur’s level of educational attainment and the use of <b>budgetary</b> <b>controls...</b>|$|R
