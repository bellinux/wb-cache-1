5|$|A {{task force}} of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) has {{proposed}} diagnostic criteria for Parkinson’s disease as well as research criteria for the diagnosis of prodromal disease, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> will require validation against the more established criteria.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{dates for}} his reign (1194 to 1170 BC) were {{suggested}} by David Rohl, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> were {{rejected by the}} majority of Egyptologists even before the radiocarbon date was published in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Another 27 {{issues of}} Amazing Stories Quarterly {{appeared}} from Ziff-Davis from 1940 to 1943, {{and also from}} 1949 to 1951, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> were not original magazines, only rebound issues of Amazing Stories.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} typical colouration, Djungarian hamsters {{can also be}} {{coloured}} pearl, sapphire, sapphire pearl, and marbled. Other colorations are available, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> are strongly suspected to appear only in hybrid crossings with Campbell's dwarf hamsters. Some of these colorations are mandarin, blue, argente, yellow blue fawn, camel, brown, cream, merle, and umbrous.|$|E
5|$|Both {{bacteria}} and eukaryotes, but not archaea, make spores. Some species of Haloarchaea undergo phenotypic switching and grow as several different cell types, including thick-walled structures that {{are resistant to}} osmotic shock and allow the archaea to survive in water at low salt concentrations, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> are not reproductive structures and may instead help them reach new habitats.|$|E
5|$|British {{discipline}} of the First World War was not especially severe compared to most other armies of the time (e.g. the Russians and Italians). The French admitted to only 133 executions and the Germans 48, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> figures may not be reliable as both armies had problems with discipline.|$|E

50|$|Online social {{networks}} are ubiquitous today. <b>But</b> in <b>these</b> digital contexts, {{it is unclear}} what defines a familiar stranger relationship. An initial definition put forward has been a behavioral one. Familiar strangers are those users that a person is not explicitly connected to but share similar behavioral patterns or interests. <b>But</b> finding <b>these</b> digital familiar strangers is not straightforward or easy.|$|R
5|$|By {{coincidence}} - {{the projected}} batch of 46 General Dynamics F-111Ks (of {{which the first}} four were the trainer variant TF-111K) were allocated RAF serials XV884-887 and 902-947, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> again were cancelled when the first two were still incomplete.|$|E
5|$|Canada's federal {{structure}} divides government responsibilities {{between the}} federal government and the ten provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons. Canada's three territories also have legislatures, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces. The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Courageous was {{initially}} fitted only with low-angle directors for her guns, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> {{were replaced by}} dual-purpose directors when she was refitted in 1930. (Glorious, completed later, had hers from the beginning.) Neither ship was fitted with radar before its early loss.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, {{unable to}} find any {{evidence}} of a fort in the area, the soldiers went back down Fishing Creek to Bloomsburg. Dissatisfied with their findings, the soldiers conducted a search of several unfortified homes in northern Columbia County. They captured a number of residents of Sugarloaf Township on August 31, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> were soon released.|$|E
5|$|Factory-based {{industry}} {{accounted for}} an estimated 29.7% of GDP in 2009. More than 75% of Cameroon's industrial strength is located in Douala and Bonabéri. Cameroon possesses substantial mineral resources, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> are not extensively mined (see Mining in Cameroon). Petroleum exploitation has fallen since 1986, but {{this is still a}} substantial sector such that dips in prices have a strong effect on the economy. Rapids and waterfalls obstruct the southern rivers, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> sites offer opportunities for hydroelectric development and supply most of Cameroon's energy. The Sanaga River powers the largest hydroelectric station, located at Edéa. The rest of Cameroon's energy comes from oil-powered thermal engines. Much of the country remains without reliable power supplies.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II and the Holocaust, {{large numbers}} of Hasidic and haredi Jewish {{refugees}} immigrated to Williamsburg. The congregation initially had poor relations with these groups, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> later improved with some segments of the Hasidic community. The synagogue celebrated Bunin's Silver Jubilee as rabbi in March, 1951. His work Hegyonot Yitzhak was published in 1953.|$|E

5|$|Formal {{criteria}} {{exist for}} each of the main subtypes of Guillain–Barré syndrome (AIDP and AMAN/AMSAN, see below), <b>but</b> <b>these</b> may misclassify some cases (particularly where there is reversible conduction failure) and therefore changes to these criteria have been proposed. Sometimes, repeated testing may be helpful.|$|E
5|$|Horsfield {{enjoyed a}} good start to 2005–06, signing a new two-year {{contract}} and scoring twice in each of Albion's first two home games, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> {{proved to be the}} last goals he would score for the club. He made a total of 20 appearances in league and cup during his final season at West Bromwich Albion.|$|E
5|$|In Britain and elsewhere, {{commercial}} forestry has created new habitat which has increased numbers, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> gains {{are likely to}} be temporary as the woodland develops and becomes unsuitable for nightjars. In the United Kingdom, it is red-listed as a cause for concern, and in Ireland it is close to extinction.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} all major {{warships}} of her day, Dreadnought was fitted with anti-torpedo nets, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> were removed {{early in the}} war, since they caused considerable loss of speed and were easily defeated by torpedoes fitted with net-cutters.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Franco-Spanish expedition, Carolinians led Native American raiding expeditions that besieged Pensacola, {{one of the few}} remaining Spanish outposts in Florida. They also mobilized Native American forces to attack Mobile, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> efforts were frustrated by French diplomatic activities in the Native American communities and also by false rumors of another Franco-Spanish expedition.|$|E
