500|$|Hello, all you Cyberheads! Welcome to the 90's {{version of}} intimacy. You can hear me... You can even see me... But you can't touch me... do you {{recognize}} my voice?... It's Madonna. Often imitated, but never duplicated. Or, should I say, often irritated? If you feel like it, you can download the sound file of my new single [...] "Secret", from my new album, Bedtime Stories, which comes out next month. I just shot the video in New York, and will be premiering an exclusive sample of it online. So check back soon. In the meantime, why don't you post me a message {{and let me know}} what you think of my new song. And by the way, don't <b>believe</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> those online imposters pretending to be me... ain't nothing like the real thing. Peace out.|$|E
500|$|The series had {{originated}} from a production deal between Syfy and CBS Paramount Network Television. Thomas Vitale, the {{senior vice president}} of programming and original movies for Syfy, described the partnership as a way to add more [...] "genre programming to our schedule". It was one of three series UPN ordered as mid-season replacements during the 2000-2001 television season; the others were Chains of Love and Special Unit 2. The network had requested six episodes of All Souls when picking it up for air, and all of them had been shot before its cancellation. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer's John Levesque felt that the network decided to produce All Souls in an attempt to find another successful series following the end of [...] While Levesque thought the shows were [...] "promising," [...] he did not <b>believe</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them were a [...] "slam-dunk".|$|E
500|$|Along with Knocked Up and Waitress, {{two other}} 2007 films about women facing {{unplanned}} pregnancies, Juno was interpreted by some critics {{as having a}} pro-life theme. Ann Hulbert of Slate magazine believed that Juno [...] " [...] both pro-life and pro-choice purism." [...] Jeff Dawson of The Sunday Times believed that the film was inevitably placed in the [...] "unwanted pregnancy subgenre" [...] with Knocked Up and Waitress due to its subject matter but thought that its interpretation as a pro-life film only [...] "muddied the waters". Hadley Freeman of The Guardian criticized Juno for [...] "complet a hat-trick of American comedies in the past 12 months that present abortion as unreasonable, or even unthinkable—a telling social sign", though she noted, [...] "I don't <b>believe</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> these films is consciously designed to be anti-abortion propaganda." [...] A. O. Scott, writing for The New York Times, agreed that Juno has [...] "an underlying theme, a message that is not anti-abortion but rather pro-adulthood." [...] Ellen Page commented, [...] "What I get most frustrated at is when people call it a pro-life movie, which is just absurd... The {{most important thing is}} the choice is there, and the film completely demonstrates that." [...] Cody and Page have openly stated that they are pro-choice; Reitman thought that it was [...] "fantastic" [...] that pro-life and pro-choice groups were embracing the film. He said that [...] "Juno seems to be a mirror, and people [...] see themselves in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What'll you do? Break {{into the}} station-house, an' pull him out?" [...] Teenie asked excitedly, <b>believing</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> his friends {{capable of doing}} such a thing, because of the style of reading in which he indulged, wherein such deeds are often performed, in print, by the {{smallest}} and most feeble boys.|$|R
50|$|Young Martin befriends Tom Pinch, a kind-hearted soul whose late {{grandmother}} had given Pecksniff all she had, believing Pecksniff {{would make an}} architect and gentleman of him. Pinch is incapable <b>of</b> <b>believing</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the bad things others tell him of Pecksniff, and always defends him vociferously. Pinch works for exploitatively low wages, while believing he is the unworthy recipient of Pecksniff's charity.|$|R

2500|$|Hudson was {{required}} to gain twenty pounds for the role, which marked her [...] film performance. In casting Hudson, Condon recalled that he initially was not confident he'd made the right decision, but instinctively cast Hudson after she'd auditioned several times because he [...] "just didn't <b>believe</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the others." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, Cowell {{said before}} the first live show that [...] "I think we could be heading for a train wreck," [...] {{referring}} {{to the fact that}} the public did not <b>believe</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the final 12 this year were as good as Lewis, But he added, [...] "But if you take Leona out of the equation, they weren't that good last year. As a whole, we've probably got the most talented 12 we've had. We just haven't had the chance to showcase them properly yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Houdini chronicled his debunking {{exploits}} in his book, A Magician Among the Spirits, co-authored with C. M. Eddy, Jr., {{who was not}} credited. These activities cost Houdini {{the friendship}} of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Doyle, {{a firm believer in}} spiritualism during his later years, refused to <b>believe</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> Houdini's exposés. Doyle came to believe that Houdini was a powerful spiritualist medium, and had performed many of his stunts by means of paranormal abilities and was using these abilities to block those of other mediums that he was [...] "debunking". This disagreement led to the two men becoming public antagonists, and Sir Arthur came to view Houdini as a dangerous enemy.|$|E
50|$|Doctor Pantera: The only married {{member of}} the Luchadores 5. He is overweight, wears a Harvard sweatshirt and a mask with a leopard print design. He and his wife Suzy are {{trying to have a}} baby. He has a {{difficult}} time justifying his crime fighting career to his wife, who seldom <b>believes</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> his adventures are real. King Karateca accuses him of being the weakest of the group due to Pantera's weight, although he is rather spry in combat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay! but I {{will hear}} you, good master," [...] she murmured with {{infinite}} gentleness, [...] "for {{the sake of}} that friendship, and because now that I have seen you again I no longer <b>believe</b> <b>any</b> evil <b>of</b> you." ...|$|R
40|$|J. L. Mackie’s {{version of}} the logical problem of evil is a failure, as even he came to recognize. Contrary to current mythology, however, its failure was not {{established}} by Alvin Plantinga’s Free Will Defense. That’s because a defense is successful {{only if it is}} not reasonable to refrain from <b>believing</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the claims that constitute it, but it is reasonable to refrain from believing the central claim of Plantinga’s Free Will Defense, namely the claim that, possibly, every essence suffers from transworld depravit...|$|R
2500|$|Anthony {{spoke in}} all 29 {{towns and villages}} of Monroe County, New York, where her trial was to be held, asking [...] "Is it a Crime for a U.S. Citizen to Vote?" [...] She said the Fourteenth Amendment gave her that right, proclaiming, [...] "We no longer {{petition}} legislature or Congress {{to give us the}} right to vote, but appeal to women everywhere to exercise their too long neglected 'citizen's right'". Anthony also proclaimed,"The only question left to be settled now is: Are women persons? And I hardly <b>believe</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> our opponents will have the hardihood to say they are not. Being persons, then, women are citizens; and no state has a right to make any law, or to enforce any old law, that shall abridge their privileges or immunities." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1600, a {{woman named}} Maddalena Busetto of Valvasone made two {{depositions}} regarding the benandanti of Moruzzo village to Fra Francesco Cummo of Vicenza, the commissioner of the Inquisition in the dioceses of Aquileia and Concordia. Claiming {{that she wanted to}} unburden her conscience, Busetto informed the commissioner that she had visited [...] the village, where she met a friend whose child was injured. Seeking out the perpetrator of the injury, she talked to the old woman she believed to be guilty, Pascutta Agrigolante, who claimed that she was a benandante and knew witches. Busetto did not know what the benandanti were, so enquired further, to which Agrigolante obliged by providing her an account of the nocturnal journeys. Agrigolante also named several other benandante who lived locally, including the village priest and {{a woman named}} Narda Peresut. Busetto proceeded to seek out Peresut, who admitted to being a benandante but who stated that she performed her healing magic in Gao to avoid prosecution from the Inquisition. Busetto would inform the commissioner that she did not <b>believe</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> these claims, but while he agreed to investigate further, {{there is no evidence that}} he ever did. That same year, a self-professed benandante named Bastian Petricci of Percoto was also denounced to the Holy Office, although it is not recorded that they took any action on the issue.|$|E

The Stranger learns of a German scientist named Enric Loathring who has been starting Frankenstein-esque experiments on dead mobsters, and now works for Capone. The Stranger {{has a hard time}} <b>believing</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> it, but Hapscomb tells him of what the ramifications could lead too. The Stranger also meets General Biggs, who is to provide military assistance in case Spookhouse were to face a major threat.|$|R
50|$|He {{was very}} careful and {{compulsive}} to exercise humility and yearned for no deferential respect, because to him all {{men and women were}} equal in God's eyes and he <b>believed</b> <b>any</b> form <b>of</b> respect and adoration's were to be directed to God.|$|R

5000|$|Nevertheless, {{the core}} {{developers}} of MacApp {{refused to let}} it die, and continued {{to work on the}} system throughout the 1990s. When all of Apple's [...] "official" [...] cross-platform projects were finally in their death throes, the team decided to take it upon themselves to fix the problem, and announced in late 1996 that they would be providing a cross-platform version of MacApp instead. By this point in time Apple was in serious trouble in the marketplace, and most developers had long given up <b>believing</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> their claims after watching one such product after another disappear.|$|R

50|$|The most {{reported}} {{adverse effects}} of phase I studies included headache, rhinitis, pain, dyspepsia, and dysmenorrhea. Investigators did not <b>believe</b> that <b>any</b> <b>of</b> these were directly treatment-related, {{as many of these}} events are considered symptoms or manifestations of the underlying illness.|$|R
60|$|All this {{voluntary}} {{testimony was}} carefully taken down, {{and although the}} magistrate did not consider it necessary to <b>believe</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> it, the arrival of Captain Horn was thenceforth awaited with interest by the police of Paris.|$|E
