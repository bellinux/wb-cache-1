5|$|Marie Stopes and David Watson {{analysed}} coal ball {{samples and}} decided that coal <b>balls</b> <b>formed</b> in situ. They {{stressed the importance of}} interaction with seawater, believing that it was necessary for the formation of coal balls. Some supporters of the in situ theory believe that Stopes' and Watson's discovery of a plant stem extending through multiple coal balls shows that coal <b>balls</b> <b>formed</b> in situ, stating that the drift theory fails to explain Stopes' and Watson's observation. They also cite fragile pieces of organic material projecting outside some coal balls, contending that if the drift theory was correct, the projections would have been destroyed, and some large coal balls are large enough that they could never have been able to be transported in the first place.|$|R

50|$|For {{a formal}} proof, {{note that the}} {{proportions}} of the different colored <b>balls</b> <b>form</b> a bounded 0,1K-valued martingale, hence by the martingale convergence theorem, these proportions converge almost surely and in mean to a limiting random vector. To see that this limiting vector has the above Dirichlet distribution, check that all mixed moments agree.|$|R

50|$|In one variation, {{the game}} starts with no blocks on the field. Blocks fall {{down to the}} playing field, and must be removed {{before they reach the}} top. If they reach the top and overflow, the game is over. In some variations, such as Bubble Bang, circles or balls are used instead of blocks—which alters the gameplay, as the <b>balls</b> <b>form</b> {{different}} shapes than square blocks.|$|R
5000|$|In any metric space, {{the open}} <b>balls</b> <b>form</b> {{a base for}} a {{topology}} on that space. The Euclidean topology on [...] is then simply the topology generated by these balls. In other words, the open sets of the Euclidean topology on [...] are given by (arbitrary) unions of the open balls [...] defined as , for all [...] and all , where [...] is the Euclidean metric.|$|R
50|$|Acarajé, a <b>ball</b> <b>formed</b> from crushed or peeled {{beans and}} fried in dendê (palm oil) is a {{traditional}} offering to Iansã in the Candomblé tradition of Brazil.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we {{consider}} the family of all compact Alexandrov spaces with curvature bound below having a definite upper diameter bound of a fixed dimension. We introduce the notion of essential coverings by contractible metric balls, and provide a uniform bound on the numbers of contractible metric <b>balls</b> <b>forming</b> essential coverings of the spaces in the family. In particular, this gives another view for Gromov's Betti number theorem...|$|R
