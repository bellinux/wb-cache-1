50|$|A <b>belt</b> <b>weigher</b> replaces a short {{section of}} the support {{mechanism}} of the belt, which might be one or more sets of idler rollers, or a short section of channel or plate.

The mass measured by the load cells is integrated with the belt speed to compute the mass of material moving on the belt, after allowing for {{the mass of the}} belt itself. Belt weighers generally include the necessary electronics to perform this calculation, often {{in the form of a}} small industrialized microprocessor system.|$|R

[...] Secondary goals {{have also been}} met: the LMG {{has the potential to}} improve battlefield effectiveness (due to its simpler and more consistent weapon action, its light weight and low recoil, and its stiffer barrel); its use of recoil compensation (with a long-stroke gas-system, for example) has produced positive feedback regarding controllability; the simpler mechanism of the LMG is both more reliable and easier to maintain; a rounds counter has been integrated to improve maintainability, and the weapon is capable of accepting other electronic devices; improved materials used in the chamber and barrel have reduced heat load on the weapon; and the weapon cost is equivalent to the existing M249.

50|$|The Mk 19A is a man-portable crew-served {{weapon that}} can fire from a tripod-mounted {{position}} {{or from a}} vehicle mount, with the latter being the preferred method, as the weapon alone weighs 77.6 lb. The primary ammunition {{for it is the}} high-explosive dual-purpose M430 grenade. On impact, the grenade can kill anyone within a radius of five meters, and wound them within a radius of 15 meters. It can also punch through 2 in of rolled homogeneous armor with a direct hit (0-degree obliquity), which means it can penetrate most infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers. It is especially effective when used against enemy infantry formations. The ammunition comes in cans that hold a 32- or 48-grenade <b>belt</b> <b>weighing</b> 42 and 60 lb, respectively. Due to its low recoil and comparatively light weight, it has been adapted for use on many different platforms, including small attack boats, fast attack vehicles such as the Humvee (HMMWV), AAV and Stryker, military jeeps, and a large variety of naval mounts.|$|R

In 2008, the port has also installed a semi-mechanised closed coal conveyor system comprising two streams with a capacity of 15 million metric tons/annum and a handling rated capacity of 1,500 metric tons/hour/stream and running for a length of 5km at two berths, namely, Jawahar Dock IV and VI, at a cost of [...] 430 million to transfer the coal to the individual coal plots {{at the southern end of}} the port, from where the cargo will be transported by rail to respective destinations, thus preventing pollution from coal dust and eliminating movement of coal-carrying trucks within the port.
