5|$|<b>Basic</b> <b>Guides</b> were {{formerly}} {{issued for}} students which, unlike the Resource Guides, {{remained the same}} from year to year. The Art <b>Basic</b> <b>Guide</b> focuses on art fundamentals, such as the elements of art, principles of composition, and different 2-D and 3-D techniques. Additionally, a brief introduction to art history is included. The Economics <b>Basic</b> <b>Guide</b> reviews fundamental economic concepts {{in addition to the}} basics of macroeconomics and microeconomics. The Language and Literature <b>Basic</b> <b>Guide</b> provides students with a basic grounding in the analysis of literature and introduces key terms such as synecdoche, metonymy, assonance, and aphorism. The Math <b>Basic</b> <b>Guide</b> offers a general overview of major topics in high school math, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and statistics. The Music <b>Basic</b> <b>Guide</b> begins by introducing the student to topics in music theory such as harmonics, rhythm, tempo, and the circle of fifths. It also includes information {{on a wide variety of}} instruments and a brief history of Western music. However, beginning in the 2010–2011 competition season, the <b>Basic</b> <b>Guides</b> were incorporated into the year's Resource Guides.|$|R

50|$|Filters reduce <b>guide</b> <b>numbers</b> {{regardless}} of whether they are gels placed over the flash device or are on a camera lens. For instance a typical polarizing filter, which attenuates 1-1.5 fstops, will diminish <b>guide</b> <b>numbers</b> to 71-60% of their unfiltered rating.|$|R

5000|$|Suppose a {{photographer}} has a flash device with a <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 44 (m)&thinsp;/&thinsp;144 (ft), [...] sets the camera’s aperture to , {{and wants to}} know the required flash-to-subject distance; he merely divides the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> by 4. Thus, a subject 11 meters or 36 feet away will be correctly illuminated (GN&thinsp;44 (m)&thinsp;÷&thinsp;&thinsp;=&thinsp;11 m, and GN&thinsp;144 (ft)&thinsp;÷&thinsp;&thinsp;=&thinsp;36 ft). For the same <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> and an aperture of , the light source must be 5.5 meters or 18 feet from the subject.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1976, Nippon Kogaku {{introduced}} the Nikon Speedlight SB-2 (<b>guide</b> <b>number</b> 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), SB-5 (<b>guide</b> <b>number</b> 105/32 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), SB-6 (<b>guide</b> <b>number</b> 148/45 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) and SB-7E (<b>guide</b> <b>number</b> 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) electronic flashes. Note that the F2 {{did not use}} a standard ISO hot shoe to mount flash units. Instead, the SB-2, -6 and -7E mounted in a unique-to-Nikon-F-and-F2 hot shoe surrounding the film rewind crank. Manually rewinding film could not be done with a flash mounted in this shoe because the flash blocked the crank. Standard ISO foot flashes can {{be connected to the}} Nikon shoe via the Nikon AS-1 Flash Unit Coupler.|$|R
5000|$|The Literary Translator and the Internet is a <b>basic</b> <b>guide</b> to help {{literary}} translators {{make the}} most of the various modes and resources of the internet to in order to share and promote their craft.|$|R
5000|$|High-end flash units {{address this}} problem by {{offering}} a mode, typically called FP sync or HSS (High Speed Sync), which fires the flash tube multiple times during the time the slit traverses the sensor. Such units require communication with the camera and are thus dedicated to a particular camera make. The multiple flashes result in {{a significant decrease in}} <b>guide</b> <b>number,</b> since each is only a part of the total flash power, but it's all that illuminates any particular part of the sensor. In general, if s is the shutter speed, and t is the shutter traverse time, the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> reduces by [...] For example, if the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> is 100, and the shutter traverse time is 5 ms (a shutter speed of 1/200s), and the shutter speed is set to 1/2000 s (0.5 ms), the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> reduces by a factor of , or about 3.16, so the resultant <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> at this speed would be about 32.|$|R
5000|$|Alternatively, {{if one has}} an {{established}} flash-to-subject distance and wants to find the required f-number, one divides the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> by the distance. Example: <b>Guide</b> <b>number</b> = 48 (m) and the distance is 6 meters; one needs and aperture of [...] (GN&thinsp;48&thinsp;÷&thinsp;6 m&thinsp;=&thinsp;).|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} is a step-by-step example of using the above formula: Suppose your full-power <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> is 48 (it is irrelevant if it is scaled for meters or feet for this purpose) and the flash device is set to 1/16&thinsp;th power. Divide 1 by 16 to obtain 0.0625. Take the square root of that (the [...] button on a calculator), which equals 0.25, and multiply that by the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 48 to obtain a reduced-power <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 12.0.|$|R
50|$|To date, {{there is}} no English edition of the catalog available. The catalog does contain a four-page <b>basic</b> <b>guide</b> for {{attending}} Comiket in English, Chinese, and Korean. This same guide is freely available on Comiket's official website.|$|R
5000|$|Example: Suppose your full-power <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> is 51 {{and your}} flash device {{is set to}} 1/32&thinsp;nd power. Take the square root of 32 (the [...] button on a calculator), which equals {{approximately}} 5.657. Divide 51 by 5.657 to obtain a reduced-power <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 9.0.|$|R
50|$|Many flash {{devices have}} auto- or manual-adjust zoom {{features}} that permit the illumination angle to be widened (lessening the <b>guide</b> <b>number)</b> to fully illuminate the image area of wide-angle lenses, or narrowed (increasing the <b>guide</b> <b>number)</b> for telephoto lenses. Such coverage angles {{may be given}} in degrees but are often expressed as being equivalent to lens focal lengths for full-frame, 35 mm cameras. Manufacturers’ advertising practices vary as to the angle of coverage underlying their <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> ratings, {{in large part because}} some flash devices can be zoomed whereas others are fixed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} is a step-by-step example of using the above formula: Suppose your <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> is 32 (it is irrelevant if it is scaled for meters or feet for this purpose) and the rated loss of the filter is 1.5 fstops. Take 0.5 and raise it {{to the power of}} 1.5 (using the [...] button on a scientific calculator), which equals roughly 0.35355. Take the square root of that (the [...] button), which equals approximately 0.595, and multiply that by the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 32 to obtain a filtered <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 19.0.|$|R
50|$|The XA {{series was}} {{accompanied}} by a range of detachable flash units. The standard A11 took one AA battery and had a <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 10. The A16 took two batteries and had a <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 16. The A9M and A1L were smaller units for the XA1 and XA4 respectively.|$|R
50|$|In photography, the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> (GN) of {{electronic}} photoflash devices (lighting equipment {{also known as}} “studio strobes” and “speedlights”) is a measure for calculating flash exposures. <b>Guide</b> <b>numbers</b> allow photographers to quickly calculate either the required fstop for any given flash-to-subject distance, or the required distance for any given fstop.|$|R
50|$|When a flash {{device is}} used for filling in shadows (fill flash) in sunlit scenes, {{it is capable of}} doing so only at {{distances}} that are a function of its <b>guide</b> <b>number.</b> The maximum <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of the flash device establishes the maximum possible distance at which it can be used.|$|R
