50|$|Although {{they may}} not drain any liver parenchyma, {{they can be a}} source of a bile leak or <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis</b> after {{cholecystectomy}} in both adults and children.

50|$|One common {{complication}} of cholecystectomy is inadvertent injury to analogous bile ducts known as Ducts of Luschka, occurring in 33% of the population. It is non-problematic until the gall bladder is removed, {{and the tiny}} supravesicular ducts may be incompletely cauterized or remain unobserved, leading to biliary leak post-operatively. The patient will develop <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis</b> within 5 to 7 days following surgery, and will require a temporary biliary stent. It {{is important that the}} clinician recognize the possibility of bile peritonitis early and confirm diagnosis via HIDA scan to lower morbidity rate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze a cohort of 46 cases of {{congenital}} duodenal obstruction, operated on between 1996 and 2002, 23 of them being diagnosed in neonatal period. In one case, the diagnosis was made antenatally, by ultrasonography. There were 15 males and 8 females, 17 with duodenal atresia and 6 with duodenal diaphragmatic stenosis. Surgery was performed in all cases, consisting in lateral duodeno-duodenal anastomosis in 5 cases and "diamond-shape" duodeno-duodenal anastomosis in 18 cases. The survival rate in this study was 69. 5 %. 12 cases (52, 1 %) had other congenital pathologies: trisomy 21 (6 cases), multiple ileal atresia (2 cases), dextrocardy (2 cases), omphalocel (1 case), situs inversus (1 case). The complications of surgery were: anastomotic leaking with <b>peritonitis,</b> <b>biliary</b> fistula, intestional adhesions with occlusion.

30|$|Spontaneous <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis</b> is {{difficult}} to diagnose before operation. The clinical features of nontraumatic perforation of the bile duct are nonspecific and similar to gallbladder perforation. The delay in diagnosis is the major cause of its high morbidity and mortality [2 – 8, 11, 12]. In the literature, ultrasonography and CT were very informative for detecting the primary lesion and perihepatic fluid collection [8]. Moreover, paracentesis is helpful for the diagnosis of <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis.</b> In the present case, {{the distribution of the}} ascites on CT and the sample of the ascites helped to reach the diagnosis of <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis.</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Laparoscopic {{subtotal}} cholecystectomy (LSC) is {{a widely}} used technique for managing cholelithiasis with severe cholecystitis. The increasing popularity its utilization {{is due to the}} good safety profile and acceptable results. This case series evaluates the short- and long-term results of Indonesian patients who underwent LSC with an objective to determine whether the procedure can be a standard approach for difficult cholecystectomy in our institution. Presentation of case: Thirty-four Indonesian patients (26 men, 8 women) with the mean age of 54. 6 years (median 54 years, range 30 – 84 years) who underwent LSC were retrospectively analyzed. Nineteen patients are suffering from type II diabetes mellitus and fourteen patients with suspected choledocoholithiasis underwent ERCP prior to LSC. The major postoperative diagnosis was acute cholecystitis (16 patients), followed by gallbladder empyema (10 patients), chronic cholecystitis (5 patients), history of cholangitis (1 patient), Mirizzi’s syndrome (1 patient) and stone retention post-ERCP (1 patient). Discussion: The mean operating time was 158  minutes (median 150  minutes, range 60 – 240  minutes), mean length of hospital stay of 4. 6  days (median 3  days, range 2 – 33  days) and drain usage for 3. 6  days (median 3. 0  days, range 1 – 19  days). Postoperatively there was one case of bilioenteric fistula, one case of stone retention and two cases of prolonged upper gastrointestinal symptoms. There is no case of <b>biliary</b> leakage, <b>peritonitis</b> or wound infection. Conclusion: The outcome of LSC in this case series is comparable with other publications showing a general favorability of LSC. Further studies are needed to elucidate the clinical benefits of several LSC technical points such as stump closure, posterior wall diathermy and drain usage. Based on this preliminary finding, LSC can be applied as a standard procedure for difficult cases in our institution...|$|R
40|$|Hypothesis: Early {{risk factors}} for hepatic-related {{morbidity}} in patients undergoing initial nonoperative management of complex blunt hepatic injuries can be accurately identified. Design Multicenter historical cohort. Setting Seven urban level I trauma centers. Patients Patients from January 2000 through May 2003 with complex (grades 3 - 5) blunt hepatic injuries not requiring laparotomy in the first 24 hours. Intervention Nonoperative treatment of complex blunt hepatic injuries. Main Outcome Measures Complications and treatment strategies. Results: Of 699 patients with complex blunt hepatic injuries, 453 (65 %) were treated nonoperatively. Overall, 61 patients (13 %) developed 87 hepatic complications including bleeding (38), <b>biliary</b> (bile <b>peritonitis,</b> 7; bile leak, 9; biloma, 11; biliary-venous fistula, 1; and bile duct injury, 1), abdominal compartment syndrome (5), and infections (abscess, 7; necrosis, 2; and suspected abdominal sepsis, 6), which required 86 multimodality treatments (angioembolization, 32; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and stenting, 9; interventional radiology drainage, 16; paracentesis, 1; laparotomy, 24; and laparoscopy, 4). Hepatic complications developed in 5 % (13 of 264) of patients with grade 3 injuries, 22 % (36 of 166) of patients with grade 4 injuries, and 52 % (12 of 23) of patients with grade 5 injuries. Univariate analysis revealed 24 -hour crystalloid, total and first 24 -hour packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelet, and cryoprecipitate requirements and liver injury grade to be significant but only liver injury grade (grade 4 odds ratio, 4. 439; grade 5 odds ratio, 12. 001) and 24 -hour transfusion requirement (odds ratio, 6. 446) predicted complications by multivariable analysis. Conclusions: Nonoperative management of high-grade liver injuries is associated with significant morbidity and correlates with grade of liver injury. Screening patients with transfusion requirements and high-grade injuries may result in earlier {{diagnosis and treatment of}} hepatic-related complications...|$|R
30|$|Common {{bile duct}} stones, cholangiocellular carcinoma, {{pancreatic}} cancer, inflammation, trauma and other mechanical obstructions of the bile duct could result by obstructive jaundice. Due to obstruction of the bile duct jaundice occurs and follows by cholestatic liver damage. Furthermore, {{as a result}} of cholestatic liver damage, stellate cells activate and hepatocellular necrosis and bile duct epithelial proliferation occurs. As a result of jaundice inflammation occurs in the liver tissue and due to the release of the inflammatory cytokines and free oxygen radicals liver injury starts. If the jaundice keeps on during 48  h and more, early epithelial proliferation of biliary tract starts. Progression of epithelial proliferation continues during 5  days and makes a peak; after 5  days epithelial proliferation continues at a basal rate. Effects of obstructive jaundice on liver tissue can occur during the first 7  days that can be called the acute period of cholestatic liver injury. The period of liver injury occurred longer than 7  days called as chronic cholestatic period (Georgiev et al. 2008). Cytotoxic biliary acids are responsible from the liver injury and fibrosis (Parola et al. 1996). Jaundice could be presented in different clinical manifestation such as renal failure, coagulation disorders, malnutrition, sepsis, and an inability to heal wounds (Long et al. 2015; Li et al. 2015). Patients who admitted to the hospital because of obstructive jaundice are commonly treated by percutaneous external biliary drainage or internal endoscopic biliary drainage as soon as after the diagnosis of severe obstructive jaundice. Biliary drainage is more effective then medical treatment. Endoscopic biliary drainage is more effective than percutaneous external drainage because of high rate of complications. Bleeding, hemobilia, bile leakage, <b>biliary</b> fistula and <b>peritonitis</b> may be listed among the complications of percutaneous biliary drainage (Pan et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONBiliary {{peritonitis}} complicating blunt hepatic {{trauma is}} a rare but potentially lethal condition. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 17 -year old male patient who sustained a complex grade IV blunt hepatic trauma presented with severe haemorrhagic shock after an initial laparotomy in another hospital. An urgent exploratory laparotomy revealed a shattered posterior section of the right liver and suture haemostasis of the lacerated liver surface was performed. Postoperatively, the patient developed generalized <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis</b> and another laparotomy with peritoneal lavage and drainage was performed on postoperative day 12. However, ongoing manifestations of peritonitis and sepsis necessitated a third laparotomy 6 days later. This revealed ongoing <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis</b> due to major intra-hepatic bile duct injury. A partial hepatectomy with intra-operative trans-hepatic biliary stenting was undertaken. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and the biliary fistula healed completely {{by the end of}} the second postoperative week. DISCUSSIONMajor intra-hepatic bile duct injury following blunt hepatic trauma is an extremely rare cause of <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis.</b> CONCLUSIONThe combination of partial hepatectomy with intra-operative trans-hepatic biliary stenting proved to be a safe and effective method for treatment of <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis</b> due to major intra-hepatic bile duct injury following blunt hepatic trauma when non-operative management fails...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionSpontaneous <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis</b> {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} acute {{abdominal}} pain.

Presentation of CaseA 31 year old woman presented with acute onset epigastric abdominal pain on a background of cholecystectomy four years prior. Laparoscopy demonstrated bilious fluid but failed to identify the site of bile leak. Subsequent ERCP localised the leak to an anomalous radical of the right hepatic duct. DiscussionSpontaneous <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis</b> is a rare diagnosis. Most cases are extrahepatic and the pathogenesis of intrahepatic ductal rupture {{has been difficult to}} define. Whilst acute bile leak is a recognised complication of cholecystectomy, bile leak four years following operation has not been described previously.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAfter right lobe donation, biliary {{complication}} is {{the main}} cause of morbidity. Mortality after right lobe donation has been estimated to be less than 0. 5 %. Patients and methodsBetween November 2001 and December 2008, 207 adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantations (ALDLT) were undertaken using right lobe grafts. Donors included 173 men and 34 women {{with a mean age of}} 28. 4 ± 5. 2 years. ResultsSiblings comprised 144 (69. 6 %) cases whereas unrelated donors comprised 63 (30. 4 %) with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 25. 2 ± 2. 4. Single and multiple right hepatic ducts (RHD) were present in 82 (39. 6 %) and 125 (60. 3 %) donors, respectively. Mean operative time was 360 ± 50 min with an estimated blood loss of 950 ± 450 ml and returned cell-saver amount of 450 ± 334 ml. Mean donor remnant liver volume was 33. 5 ± 3. 2 %. Mean intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 3 ± 0. 7 days and mean hospital stay was 14 ± 3. 5 days. Modified Clavien classifications were used to stratify all donor biliary complications The overall biliary complications occurred in 27 cases (13. 0 %). After modified Clavien classification, biliary complications were graded as grade I (n= 10), grade II (n= 2), grade III (n= 14) and grade V (n= 1). Grade I and II (n= 12) biliary complications were successfully managed conservatively. Grade III cases were treated using ultrasound-guided aspiration (USGA), endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) and surgery in 10, 2 and 2 donors, respectively. Single donor mortality (Grade V) (0. 4 %) occurred after uncontrolled <b>biliary</b> leakage with <b>peritonitis</b> that necessitated exploration followed by ERCP with stent insertion but the donor died on day 43 as a result of ongoing sepsis. ConclusionAlthough the majority of biliary complications are minor and can be managed conservatively, uncontrolled biliary leakage is a serious morbidity that should be avoided as it could lead to mortality...|$|R
40|$|Pediatric Spontaneous Bile duct {{perforation}} {{is a rare}} {{clinical condition}} with only around 150 cases reported worldwide. Early management gives excellent prognosis but the condition often presents a diagnostic dilemma. Hepato-biliary Technetium- 99 m-iminodiacetic acid scintiscan is the diagnostic investigation of choice but its availability {{in third world countries}} is limited. We present two cases of spontaneous <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis</b> in children, which were diagnosed without scintiscanning. The first case was a one-and -a half-year-old child, who was diagnosed with <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis</b> without pneumoperitoneum by a combination of Ultrasound (USG), Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The child underwent USG-guided drainage and subsequent cholecystectomy with hepatico-jejunostomy. The second child also had <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis</b> without pneumoperitoneum, which was initially suspected on USG. CECT revealed dilated gall bladder and fluid collection in sub-hepatic space and pelvis. Abdominal paracentesis revealed presence of bile. The child responded to conservative therapy. Both are doing well on two-year follow-up. In a patient with jaundice, biliary tract abnormalities and/or free fluid, either generalized or localized to peri-cholecystic/sub-hepatic space on USG/CT/MRI, in the absence of pneumoperitoneum, suggest a diagnosis of biliary perforation {{even in the absence of}} scintiscanning...|$|E

40|$|Background: Spontaneous <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis</b> {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} acute abdomen. In {{spontaneous}} <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis</b> there is perforation in {{the wall of the}} extra-hepatic or intra-hepatic duct occurs without any traumatic or iatrogenic injury and have been described more often in neonates. The symptoms may be acute or insidious delaying the diagnosis. Present manuscript deals with diagnosis and management of these cases. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective study and all patients of suspected <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis</b> presented during Dec 2010 to Feb 2012 were included in the study. After preliminary investigations in all patients abdominal paracentesis was done and in cases where intra-abdominal fluid bilirubin level was several fold higher than serum bilirubin level were subjected to exploratory laparotomy. Further investigation like T-tube cholangiogram and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was done to rule out choledochal cyst before leveling these cases as SPBD. Results: A total of 6 patients were included in present series commonest presenting symptom was progressive abdominal distension without signs of overt peritonitis followed by progressive jaundice, fever and abdominal pain. On exploration site of perforation was observed in 50 % of cases and in 50 % of cases bile duct was not dilated. Second surgery was not required in 34 % of cases. There was no mortality or significant morbidity in our series. Conclusion: Spontaneous perforation of bile duct is rare disease and high index of suspicion is required for diagnosis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} {{becoming the}} gold standard {{in the treatment of}} lithiasic cholecystitis. At present, the complications range between 0. 25 % and 0. 74 % for the major lesions and between 0. 28 % and 1. 7 % for the minor lesions. In this study, we describe a clinical picture of <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis</b> in a RTT patient after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The cause of lesion is not always easily identifiable and the multiple factors promoting a lesion can be involved, such as those ones related to anatomy of hepatic pedicle, abnormalities of cystic duct, inflammatory alterations and finally factors related to the expertise of surgical teams. In addition, the factors related to patients, such as obesity, cirrhosis, precedent surgeries and anatomical abnormalities, should always be considered. METHODS: Among the 250 patients operated on for acute lithiasic cholecystitis from January 2009 to February 2014 at the "Istituto di Chirugia II" of the Siena University Hospital, we have observed 12 cases (circa 5 % of the population) of RTT patients (mean age: 29. 0 ±years, range 22 - 36, all female). RESULTS: After twenty days the patients were released, of note, one RTT patient showed a clinical picture of <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis.</b> The presence of subhepatic fluid collection and extravasated contrast medium near the cystic duct stump and the common hepatic duct. The abdominal computerized tomography (CT) with contrast agent confirmed the <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis.</b> On an emergency laparotomy, bile duct injuries {{at the level of the}} right hepatic duct and cystic duct have been revealed. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that these risks are increased in RTT patients and therefore necessitate a more accurate pre-and postoperative assessment, both in terms clinical-Anaesthesiological and instrumental, in order to make early diagnosis and thereby prevent possible complications...|$|E

Patients and Methods: In a retrospective study, {{the records of}} patients presented with <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis</b> due to biliary perforations, managed from March 2006 to July 2009, are reviewed. Results: Eight male patients with <b>biliary</b> <b>peritonitis</b> due to biliary perforation were managed. These patients were divided in two groups, A and B. Group A, (n = 3) patients, had common bile duct (CBD) perforation, and Group B (n= 5) patients had gallbladder perforation. The presenting features were abdominal pain, fever, abdominal distension, vomiting, constipation, jaundice and signs of peritonism. The management of CBD perforations in Group A was by draining the site of perforation and biliary diversion (tube cholecystostomy). In Group B, the gallbladder perforations were managed by tube cholecystostomy in four patients and cholecystectomy in one patient, however, one patient had to be re-explored and cholecystectomy performed due to complete necrosis of gall bladder.
