40|$|The {{difficulty}} {{of dealing with}} construction and demolition waste (CDW) on construction sites is not new {{and continues to be}} a significant environmental problem. Currently the CDW collection system in Spain is done in a decentralized manner by each sub-contracted company, being necessary to implement effective waste management measures ensuring a correct management and minimization. During the last years several measures have been launched in order to improve and encourage the reuse and recycling of CDW. A widespread solution for CDW recovery is using them as a landscaping aggregate or for road <b>bases</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-bases.</b> However, measures encouraging onsite prevention still need to be enhanced. This paper studies the major work stage generating CDW and analyses the categories of CDW produced during its execution. For this, several real building sites have been analysed in order to quantify the estimation of CDW generated. Results of this study show that a significant contributor to the CDW generation on building construction sites in Spain are the masonry works. Finally, a Best Practices Manual (BPM) is proposed containing several strategies on masonry works aimed not only at CDW prevention, but also at improving their management and minimization. The use of this BPM together with the Study and Plan of CDW management [...] required by law [...] , promotes the environmental management of the company, favouring the cohesion of the construction process organization at all stages giving rise to establishing responsibilities in the field of waste and providing a greater control over the process.

In this study, resilient modulus characterisation of flexible pavement materials (asphaltic concrete wearing and binder course, <b>base</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-base)</b> used in Malaysia, according to the Public Works Department of Malaysia's (PWD) Specification for Road Works (JKR/SPJ/ 1988), were carried out so that these can be used as inputs into a mechanistic-based procedure. Granite-type aggregates were used as it is produced by most quarries in Malaysia, and it is representative of the flexible pavement materials locally used. The repeated load indirect tensile test method (ASTM D 4123 - 82) was used to investigate the effects of variations at different temperatures, gradation, bitumen content and penetration type and to determine the resilient modulus values of asphaltic concrete (ACW 20 and ACB 28). Regression models of ACW 20 and ACB 28 were developed and recommended for use as predictive models. Base (Type II) and sub-base (Type E) were tested at different gradations and moisture contents using the repeated load triaxial test in accordance with AASHTO T 3 07 - 99.

40|$|The {{horizontal}} permeability {{characteristics of}} unbound granular materials {{are important in}} many Civil Engineering applications including as filter in dams, and as unbound layers in highway pavements. In general, the gradation criteria and specification for highway <b>base</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-base</b> require the aggregates to fall within a given particle-size distribution envelope. Further criteria for the unbound aggregates are the required minimum value of permeability of the aggregates. The horizontal permeability parameters of unbound aggregates {{have been identified as}} the important cause of road failures. In recent years, the cost of maintenance for such road failures has been very high. It can be reduced if we fully understand these important parameters. Two types of aggregate, namely crushed granite for base, and sand for sub-base were examined. From these specimens, three levels of gradation categories were examined: well graded, uniformly graded and gap graded. These grading were related to JKR practice and Singapore practice and also related to the mean of both codes of practices. The horizontal permeability was measured by using horizontal permeameter. This research is intended to characterise horizontal permeability of unbound aggregates in highway <b>base</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-base.</b> The relative deviation, Dr, from the specified gradation envelope was measured with several new criteria. With these new criteria, their relationship to horizontal permeability of granular material was examined.
