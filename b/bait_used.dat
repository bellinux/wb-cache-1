25|$|Yellowfin whiting {{have become}} a major target for anglers in both South and Western Australia {{for a number of}} reasons: they are very good table fish, they provide good sport on light line, and are easily {{accessible}} from beaches and jetties, with a boat not necessary for their capture. Yellowfin whiting are actually most commonly targeted from beaches, estuaries and jetties constructed over shallow waters, with good catches often made on the ingoing and outgoing period of the tide. Due to their easily spooked nature, tackle used to capture the fish is usually very light, with lines kept below 6kg, hooks below size 4, and sinkers to an absolute minimum as heavy lines and sinkers often scare away the fish. Specialist whiting fishermen often attach a red bead or piece of tubing directly above the hook to attract the fish, although the usefulness of this is debated. The most common <b>bait</b> <b>used</b> is 'beach worms', which may be from a variety of families, with prawns, cockles and squid occasionally taking good catches also. Lure and fly fishing for the species is poorly developed, with their shy nature preventing these methods from being effectively used.|$|E
25|$|In Australia and Japan, {{members of}} the family are highly sought after by anglers for their {{sporting}} and eating qualities, with anglers often taking more than commercial fishermen in some areas. The fishing techniques for all sillaginids are quite similar, with the shallow habitats often requiring light line and quiet movements. Whiting are also popular in part due to their accessibility, with tidal flats around beaches, estuaries and jetties common habitats from where many whiting species are caught without need for a boat. Tidal movements also affect catches, as do lunar phases, causing whiting to 'bite' when the tide is changing. Tackle used is kept light to avoid spooking the fish, and often requires only a simple setup, with a hook and light sinker tied directly to the mainline usually effective. In deeper water fished from boats or where currents are strong, more complex rigs are used, often with hooks tied to dropper loops on the trace. in Australia, some specialist whiting fishermen who target the fish in the surf or on shallow banks use red beads or tubing to attract the fish, claiming the method produces more fish. The <b>bait</b> <b>used</b> is normally anything from the surrounding environment which the whiting naturally prey on, with polychaetes, bivalves, crustaceans such as prawns and crabs, cephalopods and small fish effective for most species. As with most species, live bait is known to produce better catches. Lure fishing for whiting is not normally practiced, but saltwater flies have been used to good effect, as have small soft plastic lures. In some areas, restrictions to the amount and size of fish are in place and enforced by fishery authorities.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike {{any of its}} relatives, the King George whiting {{does not}} appear to feed on molluscs, which is unusual because in many parts of Southern Australia, the main <b>bait</b> <b>used</b> by {{recreational}} fishers to catch whiting is the cockle; a mollusc, but then, it has been deshelled. [...] An excellent bait for catching King George Whiting is raw king prawn, such as banana prawn. [...] They are better bought in the shell and peeled shortly before using, as this keeps the bait fresh. Also rare in the diet are echinoderms, which are frequent prey for other species of Sillago. [...] This may be a function of niche partitioning, as in many areas the King George whiting’s habitat overlaps with other species of the genus Sillago. Other minor components of the diet include crustaceans such as carids, leptostracans, stomatopods, crabs, tanaids, cumaceans and isopods as well as other fish and benthic algae.|$|E

Each skate has about 100 hooks attached to it. “Gangens”, or the lines to which the hooks are attached, are either tied to or snapped onto the ground line. A “set” {{consists of}} one or more baited skates tied together and laid on the ocean bottom with anchors at each end. Each end has a float line with a buoy attached. Hooks are typically baited with frozen herring, octopus, or other fresh fish. Depending on the fishing ground, depth, time of year, and <b>bait</b> <b>used,</b> a set is pulled two to 20 hours after being fished. Longlines are normally pulled off the ocean floor by a hydraulic puller of some type. The halibut are cleaned soon after being boated and are kept on ice to retain freshness.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effectiveness}} of 6 different <b>baits</b> <b>used</b> in fly traps for adult fly collection was compared in October-November, 2000, near the cafeteria of Maharaj Nakhon Chiang Mai Hos-pital, Chiang Mai Province, northern Thailand. The <b>baits</b> <b>used</b> were fresh viscera (pork, beef and fish) and fresh meat (pork, beef and fish), with 500 g of each kind {{being used in}} each fly trap for each experiment. All were replicated four times. Pork viscera yielded the highest effectiveness (35. 2 %), followed by fish meat (30 %). Four other kinds of bait showed relatively low efficiency, ie fish viscera (12. 0 %), beef viscera (9. 0 %), pork meat (8. 4 %) and beef meat (5. 4 %). The calliphorid Chrysomya megacephala was the most abundant fly species collected, while sarcophagids and muscid flies were found in much smaller numbers. The number of females was higher than males in all collections. Although all <b>baits</b> <b>used</b> were parts of animal carcasses that were very attractive for adult flies to feed upon and oviposit, {{the result of this}} study showed the differences in their effectiveness for fly collection, particularly during the late rainy season to early winter in Chiang Mai. Pork viscera showed the highest efficacy for metallic fly collection, but not for all species. Further study of suitable baits for the medically important fly species that exist in urban areas should, therefore, be performed...|$|R
