Curtain of Broken Dreams, consists of a series interlinked chains of 1, 560 pawned, discarded wedding rings which create a physical representation of 1 % of the number of divorces in the UK over a typical 12 -month period.

The level of detail was the highest possible as different types of vehicles were taken into account for different urban networks (in geographical terms) and the analysis for air pollution included a <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> pollutants: <b>SO</b> 2, PM 2, 5, CO 2, N 2 O, CH 4, VOS, NOX, etc. Data and results were also validated using relevant literature [61 – 66].

Gel properties were influenced both by pressure treatment and by species. In both species, pressurization favored gels that had better water binding properties but were less hard and chewy. Nondenatured proteins were thermally detected in the batters after all of the combined pressure/heat processes.

40|$|Using {{eight years}} of data drawn from the records of Australia’s Centrelink agency, we {{describe}} the income, asset and decumulation patterns of over 10, 000 age pensioners. Analysis of this longitudinal data set shows that age pensioners, on average, preserve both financial and residential wealth, consuming conservatively and, ultimately, passing on substantial bequests. While younger households do run down financial wealth early in retirement, older households generally maintain their assessable asset balances, and some even manage to save. The largest falls in assets are linked to changes in household structure due to death or the <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> a relationship. <b>So,</b> {{as in many other}} developed countries, age pensioners in Australia appear to ‘under-consume’, holding on to assets, and even building a buffer, well into their later years.

5000|$|However, {{studies have}} shown that even at {{slightly}} less severe doses, prenatal exposure to alcohol can still affect the intelligence of the child in development, without having the full syndrome. Through a study done by Streissguth, Barr, Sampson, Darby, and Martin in 1989, it was shown that moderate prenatal doses of alcohol, defined as the mother ingesting 1.5 oz. daily, lowered children's test scores by 4 point below control levels, by the age of four. They also showed that prenatal exposure to aspirin and antibiotics is correlated with lower performance on intelligence tests as well. However, more recent studies have found that low to moderate alcohol consumption is not associated with children's intelligence scores. [...] This contradictory evidence could perhaps be explained by findings that the effects of alcohol may depend on the genetic makeup of the fetus. In a recent study Lewis et al., looked at alcohol dehydrogenase genes and their mutations, which humans can have between 0 and 10. These mutations slow the <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> alcohol <b>so</b> the more mutations the fetus has the slower they will breakdown alcohol. They found that in children whose mothers had drank moderately, those children with four or more mutations performed worse on an intelligence test than those with two or less mutations.|$|R
40|$|Physics {{textbooks}} {{assert that}} in the famous interferometer 1887 experiment to detect absolute motion Michelson and Morley saw no rotation-induced fringe shifts - the signature of absolute motion; it was a null experiment. However this is incorrect. Their published data revealed to them the expected fringe shifts, but that data gave a speed of some 8 km/s using a Newtonian theory for the calibration of the interferometer, and so was rejected by them solely because {{it was less than}} the 30 km/s orbital speed of the earth. A 2002 post relativistic-effects analysis for the operation of the device however gives a different calibration leading to a speed > 300 km/s. So this experiment detected both absolute motion and the <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> Newtonian physics. <b>So</b> far another six experiments have confirmed this first detection of absolute motion in 1887.

40|$|Abstract—Pulsed power {{technology}} is the key technologies {{of the future of}} national defense, while the intense electron beam source development is the high-power microwave bottlenecks. Based on previous experimental, a pseudospark discharge is a viable possibility in this respect, a small-scaled and intense PS electron beam source was conceived to drive a high energy microwave tubes. The electrons emission is the first step of Pseudospark discharge plasmas breakdown, due to high-field emission. Based on filed emission mechanism, a cathode spot heat conduction model of Pseudospark discharge is set up to deduce the microscopic transport characteristics of initial plasmas by mathematics model building method and thermodynamics motion equations. The microscopic transport characteristics of initial plasmas are embodied mainly in the <b>breakdown</b> phase <b>of</b> discharge. <b>So,</b> the <b>breakdown</b> time(trigger delay) <b>of</b> Pseudospark is calculated from the heat conduction model. This research of plasmas discharge microscopic transport characteristics in order to lay the theoretical foundation for the optimize and improve Pseudospark device design.

That may obtained by improving the production line layout of the manufacture plant, enhancing production time, and resources utilization. Recently, simulation has begun to be applied in construction industry sector. In this study, â€œWitness 2001 â€ program has been testified to be able to build a simulation model for the production line of pre-cast concrete columns and beams. This simulation model offers the alternatives to modify the production line attributes as the capacity of elements treatment area, number of re-useable moulds and labour, <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> activities and <b>so</b> on. In fact, that imitates a real plant production line. The model provides the opportunity to identify the optimum production line of the suggested layout. This research presents the results of two simulation models either for columns and beams. The results involve basically on the selection of the appropriate production layout, the required time to produce the assumed amount of columns and beams. Finally, the effect <b>of</b> machineries <b>breakdown</b> and the required resources has been determined in this research...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to elucidate the biophysical mechanism <b>of</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation, which at present is unknown. Results A model of a space-clamped motor nerve fiber was developed. It was found that this new model could reproduce <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation when it included a low-threshold, rapidly activating, persistent sodium current. However, the phenomenon was not reproduced when the persistent sodium current did not have fast activation kinetics or a low activation threshold. Conclusion The present modeling study suggests that persistent, low-threshold, rapidly activating sodium currents have a key role in <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation, and that <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation can be used as a tool for studying persistent sodium current under normal and pathological conditions. </p...|$|R
