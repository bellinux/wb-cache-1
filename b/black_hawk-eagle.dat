50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>hawk-eagle</b> is 58-70 cm (23-28 in) {{long and}} weighs about 900-1,300 grams (2-2.9 lbs). It has black plumage with varying {{patterns}} on its wings and body, and white speckling in places. It has barred wings, slightly elliptical in shape, and a long, narrow tail which is rarely fanned. The four grey {{bars on the}} tail are distinctive to the <b>black</b> <b>hawk-eagle,</b> as is the white line seen slightly above the bird's eye.While flying, the broadness and shortness of the wings become apparent. While in flight, the bird's tail is typically kept closed.|$|E
5|$|The main predators of the Guianan cock-of-the-rock are harpy eagles, {{black-and-white}} <b>hawk-eagles,</b> <b>black</b> <b>hawk-eagles,</b> and slaty-backed forest falcons. Although {{these are}} the main predators, two species of owls, crested owls and spectacled owls, are also predators. Felines such as the jaguar, puma, and ocelot can also be predators, along with snakes such as the bird snake, tree boas, boa constrictor, tiger rat snake, and fer-de-lance.|$|R
50|$|Like its diet, the <b>black</b> <b>hawk-eagle's</b> {{breeding}} behaviour is little known other than some details relating to its nest: composed of sticks and possibly other materials, the nest is around one metre {{and a half}} in total diameter and is usually constructed in tall trees, often around fifteen metres high.

Its closest relative is the ornate hawk-eagle, which is similar in size, appearance and behavior but lives at lower elevations.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{light and}} small {{compared}} to other eagles, this bird is a powerful predator that frequently hunts relatively large prey. It mainly eats large rodents, opossums and monkeys, as well as, occasionally, bats and birds. Its popular name in Brazil is [...] "Gavião-pega-macaco", which means [...] "monkey-catching hawk".

40|$|The <b>Black</b> <b>Hawk-Eagle</b> Spizaetus tyrannus (Wied, 1820) is {{a typical}} forest raptor {{classified}} as an endangered species {{in the state of}} Minas Gerais, southeast Brazil. Threats include deforestation and fragmentation of forest areas. Although the present investigation points 16 new records of the species in the Quadrilátero Ferrífero, it is noteworthy that the advance of mining activity and expansion of forestry of Eucalyptus spp. in this region are subtracting the forest remnants and increasingly reducing available habitats for this predator inside its limits...|$|E
40|$|Lagoa Santa, a {{small town}} in southeastern Brazil where naturalist Peter Lund lived, is {{regarded}} nowadays as an important historical site for the biological sciences. From 1847 to 1855, J. T. Reinhardt, hosted by Lund, collected 343 bird species. This material is an outstanding reference for many modern ornithological studies. The present paper reports the occurrence of some rare and threatened birds for the region of Lagoa Santa between 1998 and 2005. In this account I list the Rusty-margined Guan Penelope superciliaris Temminck, 1815; the Roseate Spoonbill Platalea ajaja Linnaeus, 1758; the Maguari Stork Ciconia maguari (Gmelin, 1789); the Wood Stork Mycteria americana Linnaeus, 1758; the <b>Black</b> <b>Hawk-eagle</b> Spizaetus tyrannus (Wied, 1820) and the Turquoise-fronted Parrot Amazona aestiva (Linnaeus, 1758).

40|$|ABSTRACT Neotropical hawk-eagles (Spizaetus spp.) {{are large}} forest raptors, having low {{population}} densities and high sensitivity to human disturbance. The three species of Brazil’s Atlantic forest (S. ornatus, S. melanoleucus, S. tyrannus) are threatened and {{little is known}} of many aspects of their biology, such habitat requirements, nesting behavior, and food habitats. Here I present data about the breeding biology, diet and behavior of the Ornate Hawk-Eagle (S. ornatus; OHE) and the Black-and-white Hawk-Eagle (S. melanoleucus; BWHW), and estimations of distribution - extent of occurrence (EOO) - and population sizes for the three hawk-eagles of the southern Atlantic Forest. I compiled data from nine years of field studies done in Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina combined with data from the literature (n = 191 records). I calculated {{the total amount of}} forest available for each species by GIS analyses and estimated population sizes based on species density data from the literature. The EOO was 123, 551 km² for BWHE, 92, 512 km² for OHE, and 67, 824 km² for <b>Black</b> <b>Hawk-Eagle</b> (S. tyrannus; BHE). All species experienced more than 30 % shrinkage in their historical distribution (before the year 2000). Forest remnants comprise 32 % of BHE’s EOO and around 20 % for other hawk-eagle species. Population sizes estimated for the southern region were 869 pairs for BHE (1, 684 individuals), 1, 532 pairs for BWHE (2, 849 individuals), and 2, 020 pairs for OHE (1, 192 individuals). Population size estimates based only on forest patches larger than 10 km² were 542 pairs for BHE (RS = 48 pairs; SC = 494 pairs), 818 pairs for BWHE (RS = 67 pairs; SC = 751 pairs), and 1, 178 pairs for OHE (RS = 67 pairs; SC = 1, 111 pairs). I recorded displays and copulation of BWHE in July; the nest was built in an inaccessible, emergent tree in the hillside of a valley. Two nests of OHE were found in emergent trees (20 m and 30 m height) measured 138 x 115 x 45 cm and 132 x 100 x 100 cm; one egg was found (64. 5 x 51. 1 mm). Spizaetus seems to have very variable breeding cycles and begin breeding in the austral winter. I estimated egg laying occurs from July to September with fledging happening 3 - 4 months later. Diet of OHE consisted mostly of birds (90 %) but also some mammals. Individuals of Spizaetus require large, unbroken forest areas to live, and my data reinforce the critical situation of hawk-eagles in southern Atlantic forest. All three species have lost habitat and their distributions have shrunk over the past decades. The estimated population sizes suggest concern and a need for conservation actions. Conservation of large raptors in the Atlantic Forest is not a simple task, requiring the need to preserve and limit the disturbance of remaining forests, establish connectivity among fragments and reduce direct threats to raptors (e. g., persecution). We also need to better understand the ecological requirements of hawk-eagles and establish public policies to protect both species and their habitats...|$|E
