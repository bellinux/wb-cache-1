Both 143Pr and 141Pr occur as fission products of uranium. The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than 141Pr is inverse <b>beta</b> <b>decay</b> or electron capture to isotopes of cerium, while that of heavier isotopes is <b>beta</b> <b>decay</b> to isotopes of neodymium.|$|E

40|$|Weak {{interactions}} {{cause the}} atomic nuclei to <b>decay</b> via <b>beta</b> and double <b>beta</b> <b>decays.</b> Double <b>beta</b> <b>decays</b> are extremely rare {{since they are}} weak-interaction processes of the second order. Also (single) <b>beta</b> <b>decays</b> can be extremely rare. This {{can be caused by}} either a large difference between the spins of the initial and final state (the so-called “forbidden” <b>beta</b> <b>decays)</b> or an extremely small Q value (decay energy) of the decay. All these cases are discussed in this article, and particular emphasis is given to the neutrinoless double electron capture on the double <b>beta</b> side of <b>decays...</b>|$|R

All other radioactive cerium isotopes have half-lives under four days, {{and most of them}} have half-lives under ten minutes. The isotopes between 140Ce and 144Ce inclusive occur as fission products of uranium. The primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 140Ce is inverse <b>beta</b> <b>decay</b> or electron capture to isotopes of lanthanum, while that of the heavier isotopes is <b>beta</b> <b>decay</b> to isotopes of praseodymium.|$|E

25|$|Lead, and to {{some degree}} tin, as used in solder {{contains}} small but significant amounts of radioisotope impurities. Radioisotopes undergoing alpha decay are a concern due to their tendency to cause soft errors. Polonium-210 is especially problematic; lead-210 <b>beta</b> <b>decays</b> to bismuth-210 which then <b>beta</b> <b>decays</b> to polonium-210, an intense emitter of alpha particles. Uranium-238 and thorium-232 are other significant contaminants of alloys of lead.|$|R
5000|$|... 236U, on {{absorption}} of a thermal neutron, does not undergo fission, but becomes 237U, which quickly <b>beta</b> <b>decays</b> to 237Np. However, the neutron {{capture cross section}} of 236U is low, and this process does not happen quickly in a thermal reactor. Spent nuclear fuel typically contains about 0.4% U-236. With a much greater cross-section, 237Np may eventually absorb another neutron, becoming 238Np, which quickly <b>beta</b> <b>decays</b> to plutonium-238, or fissioning (237Np is fissile).|$|R

5|$|Today, {{promethium}} {{is still}} {{recovered from the}} byproducts of uranium fission; {{it can also be}} produced by bombarding 146Nd with neutrons, turning it into 147Nd which decays into 147Pm through <b>beta</b> <b>decay</b> with a half-life of 11 days.|$|E
5|$|Astatine's {{alpha decay}} {{energies}} {{follow the same}} trend as for other heavy elements. Lighter astatine isotopes have quite high energies of alpha decay, which become lower as the nuclei become heavier. Astatine-211 has a significantly higher energy than the previous isotope, {{because it has a}} nucleus with 126 neutrons, and 126 is a magic number corresponding to a filled neutron shell. Despite having a similar half-life to the previous isotope (8.1hours for astatine-210 and 7.2hours for astatine-211), the alpha decay probability is much higher for the latter: 41.81% against only 0.18%. The two following isotopes release even more energy, with astatine-213 releasing the most energy. For this reason, it is the shortest-lived astatine isotope. Even though heavier astatine isotopes release less energy, no long-lived astatine isotope exists, because of the increasing role of <b>beta</b> <b>decay</b> (electron emission). This decay mode is especially important for astatine; as early as 1950 it was postulated that all isotopes of the element undergo <b>beta</b> <b>decay.</b> <b>Beta</b> <b>decay</b> modes have been found for all astatine isotopes except astatine-213, -214, -215, and -216m. Astatine-210 and lighter isotopes exhibit beta plus decay (positron emission), astatine-216 and heavier isotopes exhibit beta (minus) decay, and astatine-212 decays via both modes, while astatine-211 undergoes electron capture.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beta</b> <b>decay</b> (and {{electron}} capture): {{these processes}} are {{regulated by the}} weak force, and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino, while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a positron and a neutrino. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. <b>Beta</b> <b>decay</b> either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.|$|E

5|$|Indium {{is created}} by the {{long-lasting}} (up to thousands of years) s-process (slow neutron capture) in low-to-medium-mass stars (which range in mass between 0.6 and 10 solar masses). When a silver-109 atom (the isotope that comprises approximately half of all silver in existence) catches a neutron, it undergoes a <b>beta</b> <b>decay</b> to become cadmium-110. Capturing further neutrons, it becomes cadmium-115, which decays to indium-115 by another <b>beta</b> <b>decay.</b> This explains why the radioactive isotope is more abundant than the stable one.
