25|$|Most commonly, the {{location}} is determined using GPS and the transmission mechanism is SMS, GPRS, or a satellite or terrestrial radio from {{the vehicle to}} a radio receiver. A single antenna unit covering all the needed frequency bands can be employed. GSM and EVDO {{are the most common}} services applied, because of the low data rate needed for AVL, and the low cost and near-ubiquitous nature of these public networks. The low <b>bandwidth</b> <b>requirements</b> also allow for satellite technology to receive telemetry data at a moderately higher cost, but across a global coverage area and into very remote locations not covered well by terrestrial radio or public carriers.|$|E
25|$|Attached devices {{can take}} either {{the form of}} an {{integrated}} circuit fitted onto the motherboard itself (called a planar device in the PCI specification) or an expansion card that fits into a slot. The PCI Local Bus was first implemented in IBM PC compatibles, where it displaced the combination of several slow ISA slots and one fast VESA Local Bus slot as the bus configuration. It has subsequently been adopted for other computer types. Typical PCI cards used in PCs include: network cards, sound cards, modems, extra ports such as USB or serial, TV tuner cards and disk controllers. PCI video cards replaced ISA and VESA cards until growing <b>bandwidth</b> <b>requirements</b> outgrew the capabilities of PCI. The preferred interface for video cards then became AGP, itself a superset of conventional PCI, before giving way to PCI Express.|$|E

30|$|In [14], {{the authors}} {{schedule}} {{different types of}} flows for satisfying <b>bandwidth</b> and delay <b>requirements.</b> In the first phase, the algorithm attempts to allocate interference-free slots (using multiple channels) to a flow based on the maximum <b>bandwidth</b> <b>requirement</b> of the flow. The second phase is invoked for a flow if the first phase fails to allocate sufficient slots to satisfy even the minimum <b>bandwidth</b> <b>requirement.</b>|$|R

2500|$|For {{very large}} Doppler values (up to 10% of system bandwidth), time sidelobes {{are found to}} increase. [...] In these cases Doppler {{tolerance}} can be improved by introducing small frequency extensions onto the spectra of the compressed pulses.

2500|$|DDR3 modules can {{transfer}} data {{at a rate}} of 800–2133MT/s using both rising and falling edges of a 400–1066MHz I/O clock. This is twice DDR2's data transfer rates (400–1066MT/s using a 200–533MHz I/O clock) and four times the rate of DDR (200–400MT/s using a 100–200MHz I/O clock).

30|$|Each node can {{estimate}} its <b>bandwidth</b> <b>requirement</b> {{based on}} its expected data transmission requirement. The node then communicates its <b>bandwidth</b> <b>requirement</b> to all its neighbors who are expectedly forming cluster. These information later used for cluster head selection. While selecting cluster head (CH), if a node has high demand for bandwidth, then it implies that {{it has its own}} task to do and hence will get less time to pass other data. We formulate a method to select a CH with the criteria that too high <b>bandwidth</b> <b>requirement</b> has less probability of that node to be selected as cluster head as the role of cluster head itself demands much bandwidth.|$|R
30|$|TPQOR {{protocol}} {{provides the}} minimum bandwidth and the maximum delay guarantees for QoS routing. In a QRREQ packet, the <b>bandwidth</b> <b>requirement</b> is recorded by Bwreq. Intermediate node n judges {{whether it can}} meet the QoS <b>bandwidth</b> <b>requirement</b> by checking its available channel set At(n)=CT−Cr(Ni(n)) for interference-free transmitting and the available channel set Ar(n)=CT−Ct(Ni(n)) for interference-free receiving. Node n can meet the <b>bandwidth</b> <b>requirement</b> only if both At(n) and Ar(n) have enough channels to offer. The minimum number of channels to guarantee the QoS <b>requirement</b> <b>bandwidth</b> Bwreq is ⌈Bwreq/Bwch⌉ as shown in Algorithm 1. Timeout QRREQ packets are those packets whose transmission time exceeds the delay requirement Delreq, that is, Delreq≤NOW_TIME-Time. We claim that if QRREQ packets could reach the destination within Delreq, so do data packets.|$|R

The proposed schemes {{are based on a}} slicing technique and use aggressive methods for admission control.

The FM algorithm uses the maximum <b>bandwidth</b> <b>requirement</b> of the future to estimate the <b>bandwidth</b> <b>requirement.</b> The IE algorithm defines a class of admission control schemes that use a combination of the maximum and average bandwidths within each interval to estimate the <b>bandwidth</b> <b>requirement</b> of the interval.
