40|$|Abstract. To {{improve our}} {{understanding}} of the pulsational instabilities found in some of the PG 1159 -type pre-white dwarfs we performed detailed nonradial stability analyses on heliumstar evolutionary models. Adopting canonical chemical compositions as derived from spectroscopic observations, we found pulsational instabilities for all stellar masses considered (0. 57, 0. 63, 0. 7 M⊙). The <b>blue</b> <b>boundary</b> of the instability domain agrees satisfactorily with observations. The red edge, on the other hand, is found to extend to lower temperatures than presently admitted by observations. The dependence of the pulsational instabilities on helium or even hydrogen abundance in the stellar envelopes is found to be less stringent than emphasized hitherto. In particular, we obtained pulsationally unstable g modes for model stellar envelopes which are representative for HS 2324 + 3944 – a newly discovered PG 1159 -star with a hydrogen abundance X = 0. 2 and which is claimed to be pulsating...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the current}} {{uncertainties}} {{in the treatment}} of the coupling between pulsation and convection, the limiting amplitude, nonlinear, convective models appear the only viable approach for providing theoretical predictions about the intrinsic properties of radial pulsators. In this paper we present the results of a comprehensive set of Cepheid models computed within such theoretical framework for selected assumptions on their original chemical composition. We first discuss the location of the instability strip in the HR diagram, showing that nonlinear predictions on the effective temperature of the instability boundaries substantially differ from similar predictions available in the literature. This discrepancy is mainly due to the nonlinear effects introduced by the interaction between radial and convective motions and to the different physical assumptions adopted for constructing pulsation models. We found that both the blue (hot) and the red (cool) boundaries of fundamental pulsators appear, for each given metallicity, fairly independent of the adopted mass-luminosity relation. As a consequence, it turns out that they can be approximated over a wide luminosity range by a logarithmic relation between stellar luminosity and effective temperature. We discuss the occurrence of first overtone pulsators and provide an analytical relation for the effective temperature of the predicted <b>blue</b> <b>boundary</b> in metal-poor structures. We also found that predicted fundamental periods based on different assumptions about the mass-luminosity relation can be all nicely fitted, for each given metallicity, by a logarithmic relation which connects the period of the pulsator to mass, luminosity and effective temperature...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the excitation of radial and non-radial oscillations in low-mass B stars by the iron-bump opacity mechanism. The results are {{significant for the}} interpretation of pulsations in subdwarf B stars, helium-rich subdwarfs and extreme helium stars, including the EC 14026 and PG 1716 variables. We demonstrate that, for radial oscillations, the driving mechanism becomes effective by increasing {{the contrast between the}} iron-bump opacity and the opacity from other sources. This can be achieved either by increasing the iron abundance or by decreasing the hydrogen abundance. The location of the iron-bump instability boundary is found to depend on the mean molecular weight in the envelope and also on the radial order of the oscillation. A <b>bluer</b> instability <b>boundary</b> is provided by increasing the iron abundance alone, rather than the entire metal component, and is required to explain the observed EC 14026 variables. A <b>bluer</b> instability <b>boundary</b> is also provided by higher radial order oscillations. Using data for observed and theoretical period ranges, we show that the coolest EC 14026 variables may vary in the fundamental radial mode...|$|R
