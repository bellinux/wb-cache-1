5|$|Sociology is the {{scientific}} study of society, including patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and culture. It is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> about social order, acceptance, and change. Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the micro-sociology level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure.|$|E

25|$|In {{classical}} logic Aristotle's three laws, namely, the excluded middle (p or ¬p), non-contradiction ¬ (p ∧ ¬p) and identity (p iff p), {{are regarded as}} the same, due to the inter-definition of the connectives. Moreover, traditionally contradictoriness (the presence of contradictions in a theory or in a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge)</b> and triviality (the fact that such a theory entails all possible consequences) are assumed inseparable, granted that negation is available. These views may be philosophically challenged, precisely {{on the grounds that}} they fail to distinguish between contradictoriness and other forms of inconsistency.|$|E
30|$|It is {{sometimes}} assumed that “local traditional knowledge” is dichotomous to universal scientific knowledge, but this assumption fails to recognize how different <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> interlink, including <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> local and scientific knowledge. Local knowledge is less {{defined by a}} rigid and locally confined structure, but {{is characterized by a}} mixture of local and translocal elements <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> (Agrawal 1995; Robertson 1995; Eichborn 2001; Frömming 2006). Through the process of “glocalization” (Robertson 1995), elements <b>of</b> global <b>knowledge</b> are constantly incorporated into local knowledge. If, for example, the environment (that is, the biological living environment as defined by nature or the social environment) changes due to increasing connections to national and international markets—enabling new economic perspectives for some groups—the <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> local <b>knowledge</b> also change. This happens in an arena of social and cultural tensions, between the empowerment of other, nonlocal forms <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> and the creative adaptation or extension <b>of</b> local <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> (Appadurai 1986; Tsing 2005; Reichel et al. 2012).|$|R

25|$|The {{exploration}} of the Americas revealed large numbers of new plants and animals that needed descriptions and classification.

In the late 1740s, Carl Linnaeus introduced his system of binomial nomenclature for the classification of species. Linnaeus attempted to improve the composition and reduce the length of the previously used many-worded names by abolishing unnecessary rhetoric, introducing new descriptive terms and precisely defining their meaning.|$|E

25|$|By the 13th {{century the}} {{universities}} of Oxford and Paris had come up, and the scholars were now studying mathematics and philosophy with lesser worries about mundane chores of life—the fields {{were not as}} clearly demarcated {{as they are in}} the modern times. Of these, compendia and redactions, such as those of Johannes Campanus, of Euclid and Aristotle, confronted scholars with ideas about infinity and the ratio theory of elements as a means of expressing relations between various quantities involved with moving bodies. These studies led to a new <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> that is now known as physics.|$|E
25|$|Consistent {{with the}} broader scope of systems engineering, the Systems Engineering <b>Body</b> <b>of</b> <b>Knowledge</b> (SEBoK) has defined {{three types of}} systems engineering: (1) Product Systems Engineering (PSE) is the {{traditional}} systems engineering focused {{on the design of}} physical systems consisting of hardware and software. (2) Enterprise Systems Engineering (ESE) pertains to the view of enterprises, that is, organizations or combinations of organizations, as systems. (3) Service Systems Engineering (SSE) {{has to do with the}} engineering of service systems. Checkland defines a service system as a system which is conceived as serving another system. Most civil infrastructure systems are service systems.|$|E

25|$|As a discipline, project {{management}} developed from several fields of application including civil construction, engineering, and heavy defense activity. Two forefathers of {{project management}} are Henry Gantt, called {{the father of}} planning and control techniques, who is famous for {{his use of the}} Gantt chart as a project management tool (alternatively Harmonogram first proposed by Karol Adamiecki); and Henri Fayol for his creation of the five management functions that form the foundation of the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> associated with project and program management. Both Gantt and Fayol were students of Frederick Winslow Taylor's theories of scientific management.

25|$|Ramsey in {{his article}} disagrees with Keynes's {{approach}} as for him {{there is a difference}} between the notions of probability in physics and in logic. For Ramsey probability is not related to a disembodied <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> but is related to the knowledge that each individual possesses alone. Thus personal beliefs that are formulated by this individual knowledge govern probabilities, leading to the notions of subjective probability and Bayesian probability. Consequently, subjective probabilities can be inferred by observing actions that reflect individuals' personal beliefs. Ramsey argued that the degree of probability that an individual attaches to a particular outcome can be measured by finding what odds the individual would accept when betting on that outcome.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{is the latest}} consensus list of the research to date. Because there was no sanctioning body for the Blue Riband, researchers are limited to surviving shipping company archives and press reports to develop the list of Blue Riband winners. These lists are retrospective, and limited to steamships only. Therefore, most lists feature Sirius, in her race with Great Western in 1838, as the first record-holder, although her crossing was not as fast as some sail packet ships of the period. Early writers including Arthur Maginnus (1892), Henry Frey (1896), Charles Lee (1931) and C. R. Benstead (1936) were the standard sources until the 1950s. Since then, C. R. Vernon Gibbs (1952), and Noel Bonsor (1975) added to the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> with additional detail about the German ships provided by Arnold Kludas.|$|E
