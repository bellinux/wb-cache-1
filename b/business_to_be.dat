25|$|A Business Process Management {{system is}} quite {{different}} from BPA. However, it is possible to build automation {{on the back of a}} BPM implementation. The actual tools to achieve this vary, from writing custom application code to using specialist BPA tools, as described above. The advantages and disadvantages of this approach are inextricably linked – the BPM implementation provides an architecture for all processes in the <b>business</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mapped, but this in itself delays the automation of individual processes and so benefits may be lost in the meantime.|$|E
25|$|The High Court sits {{on every}} day of the year except Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays, {{although}} a Judge may lawfully sit on such days if directed to do so by the Chief Justice or if the Judge is of the opinion that the <b>business</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> despatched is extremely urgent. The High Court sits at such times and at such places as the Chief Justice appoints from time to time. When the Supreme Court moved from the Old Supreme Court Building and City Hall Building at 1 and 3 Saint Andrew's Road respectively to the present Supreme Court Building at 1 Supreme Court Lane, the Chief Justice formally appointed the new building as a place where the High Court sits by way of a notification dated 20 June 2005.|$|E
25|$|The {{officers}} were installed by the Grand Chief Justice, which then empowered {{them to create}} subordinate bodies. They immediately granted a dispensation to Druid Grotto No. 1 of Hamilton, NY (which would change its name to Mokanna Grotto No. 1 before its chartering.) Other <b>business</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> brought before the new Supreme Council included the approval of an obligation, written by Brother W.C. Eaton, and the appointment of officers to oversee committees. The group adjourned to observe the dinner hour, reconvening the next day (July 14, 1890.) The men approved the seal and badge of the order, {{as well as the}} official head covering, which was to be a turban. Originally, the color of the turban was limited by the Supreme Council, {{but by the end of}} 1890, a local Grotto could choose any color for their turbans as long as the entire Grotto used the same color; all veils were required to be silver. Veils of purple were reserved for members of the Supreme Council.|$|E

25|$|A {{man who is}} {{born into}} a world already possessed, if he cannot get {{subsistence}} from his parents on whom he has a just demand, and if the society do not want his labour, has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and, in fact, has no <b>business</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> where he is. At nature's mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him. She tells him to be gone, and will quickly execute her own orders, {{if he does not}} work upon the compassion of some of her guests. If these guests get up and make room for him, other intruders immediately appear demanding the same favour. The report of a provision for all that come, fills the hall with numerous claimants. The order and harmony of the feast is disturbed, the plenty that before reigned is changed into scarcity; and the happiness of the guests is destroyed by the spectacle of misery and dependence in every part of the hall, and by the clamorous importunity of those, who are justly enraged at not finding the provision which they had been taught to expect. The guests learn too late their error, in counter-acting those strict orders to all intruders, issued by the great mistress of the feast, who, wishing that all guests should have plenty, and knowing she could not provide for unlimited numbers, humanely refused to admit fresh comers when her table was already full.|$|E
25|$|York University has eleven faculties, {{including}} the Faculties of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies (which {{was formed in}} July 2009 by the merger of the Atkinson Faculty of Liberal and Professional Studies and the Faculty of Arts), Science, Health, the Lassonde School of Engineering, Education, the School of the Arts, Media, Performance and Design (formerly the Faculty of Fine Arts), Environmental Studies, the Schulich School of Business, Glendon College, and Graduate Studies. Some faculties' programs overlap: for instance, more than one house separate mathematics departments, although {{some of these are}} being merged; the Schulich School of Business offers undergraduate and graduate International Business Administration programmes and the Faculty of Liberal Arts & Professional Studies offers a Bachelor of Commerce with streams in Accounting, Business Research, Finance, Human Resources Management, Management, Management Science, and Marketing, as well as a minor in <b>Business,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken in conjunction with a major in another discipline. The Schulich School of Business offers undergraduates with the option of pursuing a BBA or iBBA program with a component of mandatory exchange. Also, the Glendon and Schulich units are offering or are in the processes of preparing to offer degrees in public policy and administration. The University administration has, however, taken steps in some cases to unify departments in separate faculties, in part to support York's efforts to brand itself as a university focused on interdisciplinarity. For example, the Faculty of Health, opened on 1 July 2006, houses the School of Health Policy and Management, School of Kinesiology and Health Science, School of Nursing, and the Department of Psychology.|$|E
500|$|Douglas became {{involved}} in the Everglades in the 1920s, when she joined the board of the Everglades Tropical National Park Committee, a group led by Ernest F. Coe and dedicated to the idea of making a national park in the Everglades. By the 1960s, the Everglades were in imminent danger of disappearing forever because of gross mismanagement in the name of progress and real estate and agricultural development. Encouraged to get involved by the leaders of environmental groups, in 1969—at the age of 79—Douglas founded Friends of the Everglades to protest the construction of a jetport in the Big Cypress portion of the Everglades. She justified her involvement saying, [...] "It is a woman's <b>business</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interested in the environment. It's an extended form of housekeeping." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1923 the {{composer}} Frederic Austin wrote the opera Polly, closely {{based on the}} 1729 work {{of the same name}} by John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch; recordings of Austin's work were published by Columbia's main rival, the Gramophone Company. At Columbia's request Ketèlbey produced his own version of Gay's original. Austin considered that it copied elements of his, and sued for copyright infringement. Acting as a court expert witness, {{the composer}} Sir Frederick Bridge thought that the case [...] "...is an awful bore.... These two good men are good musicians, and they have no <b>business</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fighting over the game. It is not worth the trouble.... It is rubbish. I am sick of Polly."

Historian Edward Pelham Brenton, writing in 1825, noted however that French hostility on this occasion was justified, commenting that [...] "in the then troubled state of Europe Childers and her captain had no <b>business</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> prying into the equipments at Brest within gunshot of the forts: if we had seen a French vessel of war running from the Needles to St Helens, and making observations, I suspect we should, at such a crisis, have taken the liberty to bring her to action." ...|$|E

2500|$|As the {{financial}} {{centre of the}} world, both the City and the Stock Exchange were hit hard by {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in 1914. Due to fears that borrowed money was to be called in and that foreign banks would demand their loans or raise interest, prices surged at first. The decision to close the Exchange for improved breathing space and to extend the August Bank Holiday to prohibit a run on banks, was hurried through by the committee and Parliament, respectively. The Stock Exchange ended up being closed from the end of July until the New Year, causing street <b>business</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> introduced again as well as the [...] "challenge system".|$|E

2500|$|Marcus {{probably}} {{began his}} {{education at the}} age of seven. He was taught at home, in line with contemporary aristocratic trends; Marcus thanks Catilius Severus for encouraging him to avoid public schools. Three of his childhood tutors are known: Euphoric, Geminus, and an unnamed educator. These three are otherwise unattested in the ancient sources, and would probably have been household slaves or freedmen. Since Euphoric had a Greek name, he probably taught Marcus the basics of that language. (He is said to have taught Marcus literature.) Geminus is described as an actor, and he may have taught Marcus Latin pronunciation and general elocution. The educator would have been Marcus' overall supervisor, charged with his moral welfare and general development. Marcus speaks of him with admiration in his Meditations: he taught him to [...] "bear pain and be content with little; to work with my own hands, to mind my own <b>business,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> slow to listen to slander".|$|E
