In this paper, the effect of matter fields on the <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> and the greybody factor is investigated. The results show that matter fields make a <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> smaller. They can increase the potential energy to a <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> to obstruct Hawking radiation to propagate. This causes the greybody factor of a dirty <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> {{to be less than}} that of a clean <b>black</b> <b>hole...</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} reasons the <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> in the ELIRGs could be massive. First, the {{embryonic}} <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> might {{be bigger than}} thought possible. Second, the Eddington limit was exceeded. When a <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> feeds, gas falls in and heats, emitting light. The pressure of the emitted light forces the gas outward, creating {{a limit to how}} fast the <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> can continuously absorb matter. If a <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> broke this limit, it could theoretically increase in size at a fast rate. <b>Black</b> <b>holes</b> have previously been observed breaking this limit; the <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> in the study would have had to repeatedly break the limit to grow this large. Third, the <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> might just be bending this limit, absorbing gas faster than thought possible, if the <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> is not spinning fast.

In this paper we investigate the effects of closed magnetic field lines, which connect a <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> with an accretion disk, on the extraction and transportation of energy and {{angular momentum}}. We find that, {{with the presence of}} such kind of closed magnetic field lines, energy and angular momentum can be extracted from the <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> and transported to the accretion disk if the <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> rotates rapidly enough. So a part of the energy extracted from the disk essentially comes from the rotational energy of the <b>black</b> <b>hole.</b> This provides a way for extracting energy from a <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> through an accretion disk.
