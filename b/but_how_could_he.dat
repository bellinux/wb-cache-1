6000|$|Was {{the fellow}} going to jilt her? He longed {{to go and}} say to him: [...] "Look here, you sir! Are you going to jilt my grand-daughter?"

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> {{rebuild the}} temple? The site {{was in the}} enemy's country. His men could not build an edifice and defend themselves, at the same time, from the attacks of their foes. He {{concluded}} to demand a truce of the Milesians until the reconstruction should be completed, and he sent embassadors to Miletus, accordingly, to make the proposal.|$|E
6000|$|Bulstrode felt {{at times}} “that his action was unrighteous, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> go back? He had mental {{exercises}} calling himself naught, laid hold on redemption {{and went on}} in his course of instrumentality.” He was “carrying on two distinct lives”—a religious one and a wicked one. “His religious activity could not be incompatible with his wicked business {{as soon as he}} had argued himself into not feeling it incompatible.” ...|$|E

[...] Phineas felt {{at the moment that}} the {{fighting}} of a duel would be destructive to all his political hopes. Few Englishmen fight duels in these days. They who do so are always reckoned to be fools. And a duel between him and Lord Brentford's son must, as he thought, separate him from Violet, from Lady Laura, from Lord Brentford, and from his borough. <b>But</b> yet <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> refuse? [...] "What have you to think of, sir, when such an offer as that is made to you?" [...] said the fiery-red lord.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Mollett rose {{slowly from}} his chair, and {{followed}} his host. He {{would have given}} all he possessed in the world, {{and that was very}} little, to have had the coast clear. But in such an emergency, what was he to do? By the time he had reached the door of the drawing-room, he had all but made up his mind to tell Fitzgerald that, seeing there was so much other business on hand this morning at Hap House, this special piece of business of his must stand over. <b>But</b> then, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> go back to Cork empty-handed? So he followed Owen into the room, and there opened his budget with what courage he had left to him.|$|R
60|$|Nicholas {{went back}} to the Buck's Head without {{hovering}} round her dwelling. This then was the explanation which she had wanted to make. Not dead, <b>but</b> missing. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> have expected that the first fair promise of happiness held out to him would remain untarnished? She had said that she was free; and legally she was free, no doubt. Moreover, from her tone and manner he felt himself justified in concluding that she would be willing to run the risk of a union with him, in the improbability of her husband's existence. Even if that husband lived, his return was not a likely event, to judge from his character. A man who could spend her money on his own personal adventures would not be anxious to disturb her poverty after such a lapse of time.|$|R

6000|$|Here {{were all}} her old words over again--'You will be steady, won't you, Charley? I {{know you will}} be steady, now.' How much must she have thought of him!

60|$|That at {{any rate}} must be avoided. <b>But</b> then <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> do this without {{a belief in the}} railway generally? And how was it {{possible}} that he should have such belief? Mr Ramsbottom did not believe in it, nor did Roger Carbury. He himself did not in the least believe in Fisker, and Fisker had originated the railway. Then, would it not be best that he should take the Chairman's offer as to his own money? If <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get his £6,000 back and have done with the railway, he would certainly think himself a lucky man. But he did not know <b>how</b> far <b>he</b> <b>could</b> with honesty lay aside his responsibility; and then he doubted whether <b>he</b> <b>could</b> put implicit trust in Melmotte's personal guarantee for the amount. This {{at any rate}} was clear to him,--that Melmotte was very anxious to secure his absence from the meetings of the Board.|$|R
60|$|At supper he {{was silent}} and ill-at-ease, but the missionary was jovial and animated. Dr Macphail thought his eyes rested on him now and then with triumphant good-humour.

There was something sinister about the power of that man. After supper he saw Horn on the verandah and, as though to have a casual word with him, went out.|$|R
60|$|Still, {{as there}} were no witnesses, {{he might have been}} willing to waive this point, if only he could make sure that Ramiro should learn the truth before he died.

6000|$|Near {{to the end}} of {{the room}} he stopped and looked about him like a thief.

6000|$|It {{was long}} before we found out the secret of this conversation, but we know it now, and all the world knows it. That part of the talk was like thisas one may read in all histories. The perplexed King asked Joan for a sign.

60|$|How long he sat there, {{he remembered}} not; what he thought, he {{recalled}} not. But the wildest and most extravagant plans and resolves availed him {{nothing in the}} face of this forever desecrated home, and this shameful culmination of his ambitious life on the mountain. Once he thought of flight; but the reflection that he would still abandon his brother to shame, perhaps a self-contented shame, checked him hopelessly. <b>Could</b> <b>he</b> avert the future? He MUST; <b>but</b> <b>how?</b> Yet <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only sit and stare into the darkness in dumb abstraction.|$|R
60|$|For {{some days}} after the acrimonious {{conversation}} that has been reported, the relations between Leonard and Juanna were not a little strained, although the necessities of travel brought them into continual contact. Both {{felt that they had}} cause of complaint against the other, and both were at heart somewhat ashamed of the part which they had played. Leonard regretted ever having made the agreement with Soa, and Juanna, now that she had cooled down a little, regretted having spoken as she did upon the subject. Her pride was offended; <b>but,</b> after all, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> know? Besides, he was an adventurer, and it was natural that he should make terms. Doubtless also his anxiety to win fortune {{had to do with the}} lady whose name was written in the prayer-book.|$|R
50|$|It was {{designed}} in 1935 by golfer Edward S. Stimpson, Sr. (1904-1985). The Massachusetts state amateur champion and former Harvard golf team captain, Stimpson was a spectator at the 1935 U.S. Open at Oakmont near Pittsburgh, where the winning score was 299 (+11). After witnessing a putt by a top professional (Gene Sarazen, a two-time champion) roll off a green, Stimpson was convinced the greens were unreasonably fast, <b>but</b> wondered <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> prove it. <b>He</b> developed a device, made of wood, {{now known as}} the Stimpmeter, which is an angled track that releases a ball at a known velocity so that the distance it rolls on a green's surface can be measured.|$|R

6000|$|... "But {{you must}} wait till I {{can get a}} grand escort for you," [...] said the King. But Charming said that he only wanted a good horse to ride, and the King, who was delighted at his being ready to start so promptly, gave him letters to the Princess, and bade him good speed. It was on a Monday morning that he set out all alone upon his errand, {{thinking}} of nothing <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> persuade the Princess Goldilocks to marry the King. He had a writing-book in his pocket, and whenever any happy thought struck him he dismounted from his horse and sat down under the trees {{to put it into}} the harangue which he was preparing for the Princess, before he forgot it.|$|R
60|$|Bulabantu could not, of course, {{understand}} anything which passed between Tarzan and the apes; {{but he saw}} that the ape-man and one of the larger bulls were in argument with the others. He saw that these two were standing with their back toward him and between him and the balance of the tribe, and he guessed, though it seemed improbable, that they might be defending him. He knew that Tarzan had once spared the life of Mbonga, the chief, and that he had succored Tibo, and Tibo's mother, Momaya. So it was not impossible that he would help Bulabantu; <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> accomplish it Bulabantu could not guess; nor {{as a matter of fact}} could Tarzan, for the odds against him were too great.|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> for <b>how</b> long <b>could</b> <b>he</b> live? And what <b>could</b> <b>he</b> yet {{do before}} he died? A braver man than Mr. Scarborough never lived,--that is, one who less feared to die. Whether {{that is true}} courage may be a question, but it was his, in {{conjunction}} with courage of another description. He did not fear to die, nor did he fear to live. But what he did fear was to fail before he died. Not {{to go out with}} the conviction that he was vanishing amid the glory of success, was to him to be wretched at his last moment, and to be wretched at his last moment, or to anticipate that he should be so, was to him,--even so near his last hours,--the acme of misery. How much of life was left to him, so that he might recover something of success? Or was any moment left to him? ...|$|R

And so he held fast to his post on the fifth floor of the house in the Rue Saint Benoît, a standing marvel to the world of letters for all time.|$|E

Carl read fate in VanZile's abstracted manner. And if VanZile withdrew, Carl's own stock would be worthless. But he stuck at his work, with something of a boy's frightened stubbornness and something of a man's quiet sternness. Fear was never far from him.

50|$|Following {{their trip}} to the beach, Krazy and the spaniel head to a carnival. The two then decide {{to start with the}} roller coaster which the spaniel is quick to take seat. But while Krazy is still outside trying to pay for the ride, the coaster {{operator}} suddenly sneezes, therefore blowing the coaster away, much to the girl mutt's panic. Krazy scales up the elevated the tracks to rescue his sweetheart. After chasing the coaster for a number of yards, the cat is able to get on board <b>but</b> wonders <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> stop it. The coaster eventually comes off the tracks and onto the fairgrounds where it runs through some tents and a tunnel of mirrors. Upon reaching the tunnel's exit, the runaway railway vehicle finally drops into a shallow pond, thus spilling out its passengers. Down on their bottoms, Krazy and the spaniel are daze but also relieved from their nightmarish ride.|$|R

She told him that she did not love him, could not love him, was sure she never should love him; that such a change was quite impossible; that the subject was most painful to her; that she must entreat him never to mention it again, to allow her to leave him at once, and let it be considered as concluded for ever. And when farther pressed, had added, that in her opinion their dispositions were so totally dissimilar as to make mutual affection incompatible; and that they were unfitted for each other by nature, education, and habit. All this she had said, and with the earnestness of sincerity; yet this was not enough, for he immediately denied there being anything uncongenial in their characters, or anything unfriendly in their situations; and positively declared, that he would still love, and still hope! ...|$|R
