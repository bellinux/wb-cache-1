Also, that everyone attending the festival would be searched on the way in. This announcement caused much controversy.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the middle}} of the 19th century, Masonic historians have sought the origins of the {{movement}} in a series of similar documents known as the Old Charges, dating from the Regius Poem in about 1425 {{to the beginning of the}} 18th century. Alluding to the membership of a lodge of operative masons, they relate a mythologised history of the craft, the duties of its grades, and the manner in which oaths of fidelity are to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> joining. The fifteenth century also sees the first evidence of ceremonial regalia.|$|E
5|$|When BSkyB publicised their {{intentions}} {{to take over}} Manchester United, supporters reacted furiously to the news. The majority felt the club’s traditions, built on a loyal fan base and great teams including the Busby Babes and currently Fergie's Fledglings would just be tarnished forever. United were no longer an independent entity, and major decisions affecting the club looked increasingly likely to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> {{the other side of}} the globe.|$|E

5|$|When Congress reconvened in December 1931, the Republicans {{nominally}} {{controlled the}} Senate by the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Charles Curtis, but, as Hoover later wrote, {{there was no}} real majority as Borah and other progressives were against the administration. After the Bonus Army marched on Washington, Borah and Hoover agreed that no action should <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> their demands so long as the ex-soldiers remained in the capital. Borah considered their presence intimidating to Congress, but was angered when they were forcibly dispersed.|$|E
5|$|Due to delays {{with the}} Raine Square development, the Bank was forced in November 2009 {{to seek a}} 5-year renewal of its lease in the Bankwest Tower, the {{remainder}} of which will <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> by Raine Square property developer Saracen Properties. Saracen Properties announced in May 2009 {{that they would not}} seek to renew their lease, and would vacate at the termination of their lease in November 2009. It was also revealed that the 50th floor office space once occupied by Alan Bond was still in the same condition as when he left in 1991, with Bond's former chair, desk and boardroom table available as part of the lease.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2 {{has many}} helpful {{features}} available. The player can target enemies attacking a protected objective or match speeds with them. Power can be shunted between shields, engines, and weapons, thereby allowing faster recharge of shields, afterburners, and weapons {{at the expense}} of other subsystems. These features can be ignored without any detrimental effects on gameplay. The mission parameters are not rigidly fixed, as there is an allowance for the failures of some primary objectives. When the mission is concluded, a post-mission briefing will be conducted to discuss the mission, and the performance of the player, before the next mission can <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gilbert's son, {{also called}} Gilbert de Clare, {{inherited}} the castle, but he died fighting {{at the battle}} of Bannockburn in 1314 while still quite young. The family's lands were initially placed {{under the control of the}} Crown, but before any decision could <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> the inheritance, a revolt broke out in Glamorgan. Anger over the actions of the royal administrators caused Llywelyn Bren to rise up in January 1316, attacking Caerphilly Castle with a large force of men. The castle withstood the attack, but the town was destroyed and the rebellion spread. A royal army was despatched to deal with the situation, defeating Bren in a battle at Caerphilly Mountain and breaking the Welsh siege of the castle.|$|E
5|$|Southern Cross left London on 23 August 1898, after {{inspection}} by HRH the Duke of York (the future King George V), {{who presented}} a Union Flag. Along with the expedition's personnel, equipment and provisions {{the ship was}} carrying Siberian sledge dogs, the first to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> an Antarctic expedition. After final provisioning in Hobart, Tasmania, Southern Cross sailed for the Antarctic on 19 December. She crossed the Antarctic Circle on 23 January 1899, and was then caught in the pack ice for three weeks. Cape Adare was sighted on 16 February, and the following day the ship was anchored close to the shore.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} was re-established at RAAF Station Mallala, South Australia, on 1March 1948, when No.2 (Communications) Squadron {{was renamed}} No.34 (Communications) Squadron. It operated as a VIP transport, courier and reconnaissance unit, primarily {{in support of}} the Woomera rocket range, focal point of the Anglo-Australian Long Range Weapons Project during the Cold War. No.34 (Communications) Squadron flew the only Vickers Viking to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> strength by the RAAF, and was also the only RAAF squadron to operate the Bristol Freighter. Three Freighters were taken on strength in April and May 1949, and a fourth in September 1951; one was lost with all three crew members in a crash near Mallala on 25November 1953 after its wing failed in flight. The squadron also operated Percival Prince, Auster, Dakota and Anson aircraft, undertaking regular transport duties and disaster relief along with its Woomera support work before disbanding at Mallala on 28October 1955.|$|E

5|$|The {{swing bridge}} {{spanning}} the Esk divides {{the upper and}} lower harbours and joins the east and west sides of the town. Whitby developed as an important bridging point of the River Esk and in 1351 permission was granted for tolls to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> the bridge for its maintenance. In 1609 a survey for a new bridge was commissioned while in 1628 it was described as a drawbridge where men raised planks to let vessels pass and tolls were collected. The bridge posts were rebuilt in stone at a cost of £3,000 in 1766. This structure was replaced by a four-arched bridge between 1833 and 1835, one arch made of cast iron swivelled to allow vessels to pass. This bridge was replaced between 1908 and 1909 by the current electric swing bridge.|$|E
5|$|Various {{advocacy}} groups have given Biden scores or grades {{as to how}} well his votes align with the positions of each group. The American Civil Liberties Union gives him an 80 percent lifetime score, with a 91 percent score for the 110th Congress. Biden opposes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and supports governmental funding to find new energy sources. Biden believes action must <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> global warming. He co-sponsored the Sense of the Senate resolution calling on the United States {{to be a part}} of the United Nations climate negotiations and the Boxer-Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate. Biden was given an 85percent lifetime approval rating from AFL-CIO, and he voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).|$|E
5|$|Wildebeest are {{the most}} {{commonly}} taken medium-sized ungulate prey item in both Ngorongoro and the Serengeti, with zebra and Thomson's gazelles coming close behind. Cape buffalo are rarely attacked {{due to differences in}} habitat preference, though adult bulls have been recorded to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> occasion. In Kruger National Park, blue wildebeest, cape buffalo, Burchell's zebra, greater kudu and impala are the spotted hyena's most important prey, while giraffe, impala, wildebeest and zebra are its major food sources in the nearby Timbavati area. Springbok and kudu are the main prey in Namibia's Etosha National Park, and springbok in the Namib. In the southern Kalahari, gemsbok, wildebeest and springbok are the principal prey. In Chobe, the spotted hyena's primary prey consists of migratory zebra and resident impala. In Kenya's Masai Mara, 80% of the spotted hyena's prey consists of topi and Thomson's gazelle, save for during the four-month period when zebra and wildebeest herds migrate to the area. Bushbuck, suni and buffalo are the dominant prey items in the Aberdare Mountains, while Grant's gazelle, gerenuk, sheep, goats and cattle are likely preyed upon in northern Kenya. In west Africa, it is thought that the spotted hyena is primarily a scavenger, but will occasionally attack domestic stock and medium-size antelopes in some areas. In Cameroon, it is common for spotted hyenas to feed on small antelopes like kob, but may also scavenge on reedbuck, kongoni, buffalo, giraffe, African elephant, topi and roan antelope carcasses. Records indicate that spotted hyenas in Malawi feed on medium to large-sized ungulates such as waterbuck and impala. In Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve, spotted hyenas primarily prey on wildebeest, followed by buffalo, zebra, impala, giraffe, reedbuck and kongoni. In Uganda, it is thought that the species primarily preys on birds and reptiles, while in Zambia it is primarily a scavenger.|$|E
