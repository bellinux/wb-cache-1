5|$|Although Star Trek has <b>been</b> <b>off</b> the air since 2005, CBS and Paramount {{pictures}} {{have allowed}} fan-produced shows to be created. While not officially {{part of the}} Star Trek universe, several veteran Star Trek actors, actresses, and writers have contributed their talents to many of these productions. While none of these films have been created for profit, several fan productions have turned to crowdfunding from sites, such as Kickstarter to help with production costs.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{passed by}} the Massachusetts {{legislature}} in 1933 {{made it easier for}} police officers who had <b>been</b> <b>off</b> the force {{for more than a year}} to apply for reinstatement. It was expected that this would lead to an effort by the former strikers to be rehired, but several subsequent appeals for reinstatement were denied. In 1937, Massachusetts Governor Charles F. Hurley, after meeting with some of the 1919 strikers, backed the decision of Police Commissioner Joseph Timilty not to reinstate them.|$|E
5|$|Mullen {{is said to}} have a preternatural {{sense of}} rhythm. Brian Eno recounted that while working with Mullen on a U2 album, Mullen kept insisting that the click track was off and lagging behind the tracks that had already been recorded. Eno {{adjusted}} it, thinking that he was just humouring Mullen, but later found that Mullen was right and the click track had indeed <b>been</b> <b>off</b> by six milliseconds.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, {{the fire}} {{department}} moved to Fire Station #6 with the bulb; the bulb socket's cord was severed for fear that unscrewing the bulb could damage it. It was deprived of electricity for only 22 minutes during the transfer, which was made in a specially designed box and with full firetruck escort. An electrician was on hand to install the bulb into the new fire station's emergency generator. Ripley's Believe It Or Not stated that the short delay would not mar the bulb's continuous burning record. In 2001, the bulb's 100th birthday was celebrated with a community barbecue and live music. Since that move, the bulb has run continuously for 38 years; previously it had only <b>been</b> <b>off</b> the grid for {{short periods of time}} (e.g. a week in 1937 for a renovation and the odd power outage).|$|E
5|$|Several {{television}} translators transmit their {{signals from}} two small towers {{located in the}} center of Wilkins Peak. Additionally, the religious television network TBN has a translator known locally as K35CN, broadcasting from the mountain. Prior to 2009, K22BK, the local PBS television translator, carried its signal from Wilkins Peak. K22BK was moved across the interstate to White Mountain to the same tower as its digital counterpart. In late 2009, a new television station signed on the air from the peak. It is known as K33IX-D on channel 33 (UHF) and carries programming from EICB TV, a Christian religious broadcast and production company, based in Cedar Hill, Texas. K35CN and K22BK have <b>been</b> <b>off</b> the air since the digital television transition in the year 2009.|$|E
5|$|HMS Shannon had <b>been</b> <b>off</b> Boston for 56 {{days and}} was running short of provisions, whilst the {{extended}} period at sea {{was wearing the}} ship down. She would be at a disadvantage facing USS Chesapeake, fresh from harbour and a refit. A boat was despatched carrying the invitation, manned by a Mr Slocum, a discharged American prisoner. The boat had not reached the shore when Chesapeake was seen underway, sailing out of the harbour. She was flying three American ensigns and a large white flag at the foremast inscribed 'Free Trade and Sailor's Rights'. Shannon carried 276 officers, seamen and marines of her proper complement, eight recaptured seamen, 22 Irish labourers who had been 48 hours in the ship, of whom only four could speak English, and 24 boys, of whom about 13 were under 12 years of age. Broke had trained his gun crews to fire accurate broadsides into the hulls of enemy vessels, {{with the aim of}} killing their gun crews, rather than attempting to disable the enemy ship by firing at the masts and rigging. This was, however, the standard Royal Navy practise of the time, only Broke's efficiency in gunnery training distinguished him in this regard. Lawrence, meanwhile, was confident in his ship, especially since she carried a substantially larger crew. Previous American victories over Royal Navy ships left him expectant of success. Just before the engagement, the American crew gave three cheers.|$|E

25|$|With a large {{agricultural}} heritage, {{many farmers}} oppose DST because their days {{are controlled by}} the sun, not the clock. Farmers are often dependent on younger workers whose parents want them home by dinner, and {{when the sun is}} up later in the evening, farmers miss out on recreational activities that only happen late.

25|$|On 28 August, the {{offensive}} operation was extended, {{with the aim}} of occupying Moung Phine for a week and blocking the intersection of Routes 9 and 23 nine kilometers west of the town. As Moung Phine was the only Pathet Lao-held town in the Laotian panhandle, and served as a communist sanctuary, it was a prime target because it had <b>been</b> <b>off</b> limits to air strikes. The renewed operation was facetiously dubbed Junction City Jr. after both the 1967 operation in South Vietnam and the road junction objective.|$|E

25|$|Season twenty-three {{eventually}} {{aired in}} the autumn of 1986. Production of the new season was complicated by various factors. Although the episode length had been reverted to 25minutes, the number of episodes was reduced to fourteen, just over half the length of most previous seasons. The series was still up against The A-Team and, having <b>been</b> <b>off</b> the air for eighteen months, found it hard to regain viewers who had turned to ITV. Saward and Nathan-Turner had decided on an overarching storyline for the entire season entitled The Trial of a Time Lord, but its complexities proved confusing to both writers and viewers, with the season drawing viewing figures of only four to five million.|$|E

He was unable to regain all of the weight or train at full capacity before the 2009 U.S. Championships in January 2009, where he singled the planned triple axel in both his short and long programs and also fell on the triple lutz in the long, resulting in a fifth-place finish. It was the first time since 2003 that he had <b>been</b> <b>off</b> the podium at Nationals. He was subsequently not named to the U.S. team for the World Championships.|$|E
25|$|On 5 May Hutchinson {{now with}} 8,000 British troops marched {{along the banks}} of the Nile towards the {{position}} of General Lagrange at El Aft accompanied on the river by a division of British and Ottoman gun boats. Meanwhile, Sir William Sidney Smith in HMS Tiger with Commander James Hillyar were expecting the arrival of Rear Admiral Joseph Antoine Ganteaume upon the coast in support of the French land forces. The French squadron under Gantheaume consisting of four ships of the line - a frigate, a corvette and five transports had <b>been</b> <b>off</b> the coast for some days. The men of war had between three and four thousand troops on board all. however Gantheaume fearing the approach of Sydney's ships which was in search of him cut his cables and stood off to sea. The five transports were empty of troops having been transferred to the ships. but the only occupants being many civilians were taken by Sydney's ships on the 7th and brought into Abu Qir Bay. The British took all the provisions and stores on board the transports and with the retreat of their fleet the French thus abandoned El Aft and retreated towards Er-Rahmaniyeh on May 7. On the same evening allied troops entered El Aft and thus commenced the Cairo campaign.|$|E
