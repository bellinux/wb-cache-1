500|$|The Act is {{designed}} to prevent the avoidance of implied terms through exclusion clauses. It provides (in Section 4) that any attempt to exclude a seller in consumer sales from Sections 2 and 3 is void. In non-consumer sales an exclusion clause is void [...] "to {{the extent that it}} is shown {{that it would not be}} fair or reasonable to allow reliance on the term". The burden of proof in such situations is on the party seeking to avoid liability through the exclusion clause. For determining whether it is [...] "fair or reasonable" [...] to allow the exclusion clause, five tests are used; 1) whether the parties were of equal <b>bargaining</b> <b>strength,</b> 2) whether the buyer was induced to agree to the clause, 3) whether the buyer knew, or ought to have known of the exclusion clause, 4) where the liability is conditional, if the condition is reasonable and 5) whether the goods were supplied as part of a special order. These basic tests were later extended into the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.|$|E

In Walker, two private parties, albeit both with solicitors acting on their behalf had made an agreement to sell a country house. Some standard terms called the [...] "National Conditions of Sale" [...] were incorporated, and these contained a clause excluding liability for misrepresentations. Even though these terms were widely used, it was held that between the parties their use fell foul of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 3, since they were not negotiated by interested trade parties. A court will weigh up a number of considerations (was the clause transparent? which party is better insured to bear the risk?) but the most important consideration is what the <b>bargaining</b> <b>strength</b> of the parties were.|$|E

Every man's limit of what he can pay and what he can take, of how much he can offer and how much he will receive, is based on the similar limitations of other people. They are reciprocal to one another. Why should one factory owner not pay ten dollars a day to his hands? Because the others don't. But suppose they all do? Then the output could not be sold at the present price. But why not sell the produce at a higher price? Because at a higher price the consumer can't afford to buy it. But suppose that the consumer, for the things which he himself makes and sells, or for the work which he performs, receives more? What then? The whole thing begins to have a jigsaw look, like a child's toy rack with wooden soldiers on it, expanding and contracting. One searches in vain for the basis on which the relationship rests. And {{at the end of the}} analysis one finds nothing but a mere anarchical play of forces, nothing but a give-and-take resting on relative <b>bargaining</b> <b>strength.</b> Every man gets what he can and gives what he has to.|$|E

The model compares the processors and producers' <b>bargaining</b> <b>strengths</b> {{in order to determine}} the equilibrium price of live chickens in Ontario. The theoretical results show how the equilibrium price of live chickens and each party's profit depend on the coefficient of bargaining power. The stochastic properties of price and cost data call for cointegration techniques to infer the bargaining weights. The hypothesis of equal <b>bargaining</b> <b>strengths</b> between processors and producers in Ontario over the 1997 - 2002 period is strongly rejected by the data. It is shown that chicken processors had greater bargaining power than chicken producers because live chicken prices were highly correlated to chicken producers' average costs.

40|$|An {{optimal control}} model is derived to {{determine}} the impacts of agricultural expansion, timber production {{and the influence of}} interest groups with unequal <b>bargaining</b> <b>strengths</b> on the steady-state forest stock. The paper shows that the optimum forest stock increases with increased benefits from timber production and the forest itself and decreases with agricultural land expansion. Extending the model to the influence of interest groups, the paper shows that if the interest groups that place a relatively high weight on agricultural expansion and timber benefits dominate the decision-making process, the optimum forest area decreases and agricultural land will increase. The role of interest groups with their <b>bargaining</b> <b>strengths</b> is therefore an important determinant of deforestation. The conclusions of the model are used to describe the path of deforestation in the island of Mauritius. The paper concludes that sustainable forest land management calls for an efficient participatory approach, taking into account a fair representation of interest groups coupled with good governance, accountability and transparency. steady-state forest stock; optimal control; deforestation; political economy; interest groups; agricultural expansion; agriculture; forest control; forestry; timber production; agricultural land; land expansion; forest areas; modelling; Mauritius; sustainable land management; participatory approach; good governance; accountability; transparency; forest management...|$|R

If the same facts arose again today, the case would be regulated by unfair terms legislation, and Miss L'Estrange would have won, despite having signed. The Sale of Goods Act 1979 section 14(3) implies that goods for sale have a warranty from the seller as to their fitness. Between two businesses dealing as commercial parties of equal <b>bargaining</b> <b>strength,</b> this term could be excluded. But when one party is a consumer, the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 section 6(2)(a) stipulates that the warranty about fitness cannot be excluded.

Both schemes are considered against the benefits and obstacles in their practical implementation, ability to achieve the regulatory goal, political reactions and international obligations. Ultimately, this paper does not recommend adoption of a mandatory regulation and advises a cautionary approach to Fair Trade Music. Ostensibly it is unlikely the government will pursue either regulatory response without some politcal impetus...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} dynamic model of {{decentralized}} many-to-one matching {{in the context}} of a competitive labor market. Through wage offers and wage demands, firms compete over workers and workers compete over jobs. Firms make hire-and-fire decisions dependent on the wages of their own workers and on the alternative workers available on the job market. Workers bargain for better jobs; either individually or collectively as unions, adjusting wage demands upward/downward depending on whether they are currently employed/unemployed. We show that such a process is absorbed into the core with probability one in finite time. Moreover, within the core, allocations are selected that are characterized by surplus splitting according to a bargaining solution such that (i) firms and workforce share total revenue according to relative <b>bargaining</b> <b>strengths,</b> and (ii) workers receive equal workforce shares above their individual outside options. These results bridge empirical evidence and provide a rich set of testable predictions...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of logistical and negotiation success from the terroristsâ viewpoint in hostage-taking missions. Logistical success indicates that the terrorists apparently completed the mission as planned, while negotiation success means that the terrorists received some of their initial demands. In the empirical analysis, the article utilizes a new data set on hostage incidents from 1978 through 2005 for the logit regressions. Empirical results broadly support our theoretical predictions. Logistical success depends positively on terrorist resources and target vulnerability, while negotiation success increases with the relative disagreement values and relative <b>bargaining</b> <b>strengths</b> of the terrorists. More specifically, terrorist success at the execution stage depends positively on kidnappings and large hostage grabs, and varies negatively with attack force diversity and terrorist casualties. Negotiation success depends on bargaining variables (i. e., the number of hostages, casualties, incident duration and other proxies). The article shows that the factors that determine terrorist negotiation success differ between kidnappings and nonkidnappings (i. e., skyjackings, the takeover of buildings, and the hijacking of nonaerial means of transport), owing to location and other considerations (e. g., types of demands). In particular, making multiple demands bolsters negotiated success in nonkidnappings, while demanding money fosters negotiated success in kidnappings. Lengthier incidents have {{a positive influence on}} the likelihood of terrorists gaining concessions in kidnappings and nonkidnappings.
