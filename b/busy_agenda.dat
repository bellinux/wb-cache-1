500|$|Even {{with this}} <b>busy</b> <b>agenda,</b> Paoli's {{financial}} situation remained strained. After living in New York City for {{almost the entire}} year of 1927, Paoli decided {{to come back to}} Puerto Rico to live and work with his sister Amalia, giving voice lessons at the Academia Paoli. Paoli also helped produce Othello at the Municipal Theater in San Juan. For the next two decades Paoli's main concern would be teaching at the Paoli Academy with Amalia. In 1928, the tenor performed Verdi's Otello entirely for the last time in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This was his last performance on stage. It took place at the San Juan Municipal Theater, known today as the Tapia Theater. In 1935, the government of Puerto Rico named the San Juan Municipal Theater in his honor, changing its name to Teatro Paoli. In 1929, his wife Josephine died and a year later he married Adelaida Bonini, from Rimini, Italy, and whom he affectionately called [...] "Adina". He gave his last singing performance in 1942, while commemorating the one-year anniversary of the death of his sister, Amalia Paoli. The service was conducted at the Chapel of the University of the Sacred Heart (Santurce).|$|E

50|$|There were notable divergences {{from the}} campaigning style of 1982: González himself, being now the Prime Minister, had a <b>busy</b> public <b>agenda</b> {{and was only}} able to {{participate}} in large campaign events during weekends, having little time to maintain direct contact with party militants. He also wanted to distance himself from direct confrontation to the other parties' candidates, usually leaving that task to Deputy Prime Minister Alfonso Guerra and other PSOE leaders, in order to emphazise his image as Chief of the Executive. The PSOE's electoral manifesto for the 1986 election also avoided making any concrete pledges such as those done in 1982.|$|R
2500|$|As Prime Minister, Keating {{maintained}} his aggressive debating style. When asked by Opposition Leader John Hewson {{why he would}} not call an early election after he had become prime minister, Keating replied, [...] "because I want to do you slowly." [...] He referred to the Liberal Party as [...] "a motley, dishonest crew", and the National Party as [...] "dummies and dimwits; desperadoes". During an opposition debate that sought to censure Keating, he described being attacked by Peter Costello as [...] "like being flogged with warm lettuce". Despite a very <b>busy</b> legislative <b>agenda,</b> many commentators predicted that the upcoming 1993 election was [...] "unwinnable" [...] for Labor. The government had been in power for the previous decade, and the pace of economic recovery from the early 1990s recession was slow.|$|R

They mainly toured in Germany and Scandinavia. With Jean Innemee and Conny Peters (The Walkers) they record a single titled 'Ohio Sun'. On the track, Erwin sang the lyric [...] "I'm a son of Cincinnati," [...] which later appears prophetical, as does the name Opus. After this single Bert Bessems joins as solo guitarist. For a while they play covers in the Limburg dance halls {{under the name of}} Windmill in which Erwin plays keyboards. It becomes a regional success and they record four singles, 'Angeline', 'Lelia', 'Amy', and 'For you to remember', which is a modest hit. Ab van Goor replaces Jo Robeers on vocals and drums in 1976. Despite a <b>busy</b> <b>agenda</b> the band works silently on their own material and sends a demo to Phonogram Records in Hilversum. Producer Dennis Kloeth hears the material and offers the band a record deal.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt} Research {{is about}} both {{generation}} {{and dissemination of}} findings. In spite of this, disseminating research findings has often been an afterthought in <b>busy</b> research <b>agendas.</b> When the funding of a research program is considered, insufficient time and money are set aside to link research to practice. And, if efforts have in truth been made to incorporate dissemination into the earliest stages of planning, experience reveals that matching the research design to the characteristics of intended users is not easy. No matter what, research findings will simply not be used if the latter are ignored. And so, willy-nilly,research institutions have come to agree that they must find ways to relate research findings to practical applications in planning, policy making, program administration, and delivery of services. There is evidence that they are becoming better at this: some {{pay attention to the}} production of research findings {{in a wide range of}} formats in recognitionof the variety of users. Notwithstanding, while important initiatives undoubtedly exist, research findings still do not inform practice to the extent that they should. For each research agenda, this calls for a dissemination policy, a dissemination plan, and a dissemination strategy. Dissemination tactics will then come into play...|$|R
5000|$|If Mooca lacks {{green spaces}} in one hand, it offers sport venues and {{nature in the}} 196.000sqm of its sports club, Clube da Mooca, and at the local {{athletics}} club, Clube Atlético Juventus, which has a namesake soccer team and a small stadium (Estádio Conde Rodolfo Crespi), as mentioned above. Juventus soccer team was formed in 1924 {{under the name of}} Cotonifício Rodolfo Crespi F.C. and consisted of players who worked at Cotonifício Crespi textile industry (see photo above). One year later, a piece of land at Rua Javari next to the plant facilities was donated to the community by Crespi, owner of the textile industry, so {{that there would be a}} property for the construction of venue for the community and for the recently formed team to play. Cotonifício Rodolfo Crespi F.C switched its name in 1930, a year after it won São Paulo state league. The name Clube Atlético Juventus was suggested by Crespi. Estádio Conde Rodolfo Crespi hosted in 1959 a match between Juventus and Santos F.C., in which Pelé scored the most beautiful goal in his career. SESC Belenzinho - is a cultural centre and sports venue and, although it is located just outside the district, it is site of interest in the area as provides Mooca's population with a variety of quality theatre plays, <b>busy</b> cultural <b>agenda</b> and sports training (e.g. tennis, soccer, volleyball, basketball, yoga, pilates, etc.) ...|$|R
40|$|The news {{over the}} {{allegations}} raised by Prof. Simon Chapman from Australia Sydney University that hemoglobin protein obtained from pig blood {{is being used}} in cigarette filters has kept the <b>agenda</b> <b>busy</b> in recent days. It was stated that vegetarians and Muslims and Jews who are sensitive about pork products because of religious beliefs will not be pleased with this news. The analyses of the cigarette samples sent to our Agency {{in order to be}} examined for pig blood has been carried out at the Consumer Safety and Health Effects Research Laboratories. Presence of pig blood in cigarette filter was investigated by real time PCR technique. As a result, pig DNA was not determined in the cigarette filters that were analyzed. In order to analyze the presence of hemoglobin protein in cigarette filters, mass screening was conducted with UPLC-TOF-MS (Ultra performance liquid chromotography-time of flight mass spectrometry); as a result hemoglobin was not found in the analyzed cigarette filters. This research was a pilot study in nature and more detailed studies about the subject will be helpful...|$|R
40|$|A full-mouth {{adhesive}} rehabilitation in case {{of severe}} dental erosion may present a challenge for both the clinician and the laboratory technician, {{not only for the}} multiple teeth to be restored, but also for their time schedule, difficult to be included in a <b>busy</b> <b>agenda</b> of a private practice. Thanks to the simplicity of the 3 -step technique, full-mouth rehabilitations become easier to handle. In this article the treatment of a very compromised case of dental erosion (ACE class V) is illustrated, implementing only adhesive techniques.

40|$|There {{are little}} {{initiatives}} supporting knowledge workers in implementing physical activity {{as part of}} their work routines. Due to the sedentary nature of their work, knowledge workers have little opportunities to engage in physical activities during the working hours. In addition, physical activity is not a priority in their <b>busy</b> <b>agenda,</b> which results in knowledge workers been unaware of their physical behavior at work. Behavioral models are considering both self-reflection and self-awareness processes as key elements for an individual to take action over desirable behaviors. Considering self-reflection as the mean to achieve selfawareness, the design of persuasive technologies for physical activity is challenged to go beyond supporting data collection and visualization of physical behavior to actively support the process of self-reflection. This paper introduces ESTHER 1. 3 as an approach to facilitate active mini cycles of self-reflection on physical activity by means of in-situ self-reporting mechanisms. ESTHER 1. 3 will be tested in the field to explore how the implementation of these mechanisms assists the planning of physical activity targets during work time and how the performance of these targets differ compared to when the application only provides physical activity information. With the ultimate goal to integrate physical activity into a person’s daily work routines, the design of ESTHER 1. 3 based on Personal Informatics (PI) by encouraging deeper reflection on collected data to perform better-informed actions...|$|E
40|$|This is my {{penultimate}} President's Page, {{and there}} are many issues that I would like to share with you, includ-ing some AsMA developments, aviation and space-re-lated news, as well as some personal experiences. I sincerely hope and wish that none of our colleagues and their families were personally impacted by the tsunami that affected many costal areas in several coun-tries. AsMA contributed to the relief effort by providing a monetary donation to the International Red Cross. This catastrophic event emphasized, once again, the crit-ical role of air transportation for the effective and effi-cient mobilization of human resources, supplies, and equipment. It is very satisfying to know that our profes-sional efforts and dedication in support of aviation con-tribute directly or indirectly in assisting people in other meaningful ways. I am writing this page while I prepare for the next AsMA Executive Committee meeting that is scheduled for February 24, 2005. We will have a very <b>busy</b> <b>agenda.</b> We are planning to discuss the status of the AsMA Strategic/Business Plan initiatives, including our finan-cial plan and investment strategies, the mentorship pro-gram, the redesign of our webpage, position papers and resolutions, membership growth, continuing education programs, national and international outreach activities, aerospace medicine advocacy efforts, etc. In my final President's Page, I will share the outcomes of our meet-ing and provide a progress report.

40|$|The general aim of {{the present}} thesis was to {{investigate}} the determinants of car users’ switching to public transport when driving to work. Since the quality of services is particularly low in medium-sized cities, making the car a much more attractive option, the studies focus on car-use in such cities. Four studies were conducted. In the first (Paper I), an Internet survey addressing what people using their cars to commute to work in a medium-size city believe would make them reduce their car-use as well as what improvements to public transport services they believe would make them use those services was conducted. The results showed that, the further to work and/or bus stops - the more the participants desired increased frequencies and shorter travel times, but less often lower fares. In the second study (Paper II), using a web-based experimental simulation, participants were given the task of planning their travel to and from work, including the performing of additional activities in accordance with predetermined agendas. The main results of this were that shorter travel times and good access to bus stops led to greater bus use while constraints imposed by a <b>busy</b> daily <b>agenda</b> led to greater car-use, in particular if car costs were low. In the third study (Paper III) a scale for measuring satisfaction with travel was developed. A new measure of travel-related subjective well-being (SWB), a 9 -item self-report Satisfaction with Travel Scale (STS), was developed. The results showed that STS is reliable and differentiates between changes in travel conditions. In the fourth study (Paper IV) which attributes other than time and cost contribute to the preference of car over bus in the choice of travel mode was investigated. Using STS, developed in Paper III the effect of different travel modes on satisfaction with travel was studied. The conclusions of this thesis are that a public transport system must appear attractive, not only to its present users, but also to prospective users who currently use their cars. To appear attractive, it must not be too expensive and must have timetables and routes that allow users to travel in an efficient manner. One measure {{that can be used to}} force commuters out of their cars is higher car-use costs; however, car-use costs may need to be substantially higher than the cost of using public transport in order to be effective. As the present research has indicated, the perceived difficulty of using public transport is also an important factor. Raising car-use costs will thus be insufficient unless changes are made to public transport services. A factor complicating this is activity patterns, which are often complex. As has been indicated in the present research, the more complex the activity pattern - the more the car is used as a means of transport...|$|R
