25|$|The Second Vatican Council {{assembled}} approximately 2500 major prelates {{from all}} five continents. It {{soon became clear}} that a dividing up of this large body was necessary. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> go about carrying out this division? The answer was by resorting to the already partly existing structures, i.e., the Bishops' Conferences. These would normally coincide with national boundaries, as had long been the case with the German Episcopal Conferences which had existed for over 100 years. A hurried establishment of such entities, willed by the Holy See to be ad hoc, was effected {{for the sole purpose of}} facilitating the working out of common stands on the Council documents. Any bishop who presented a paper in the Council aula in the name of such a conference was granted priority.|$|E
500|$|For example, Trimmer {{contends that}} Sunday schools teach their pupils {{not merely to}} read the Bible <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> draw the proper {{theological}} and political conclusions from it. Furthermore, Trimmer argues that the responsibility for educating the poor rests {{on the shoulders of}} the middle class alone. By eliminating the aristocracy from an active role in her philanthropic programs, [...] "Trimmer ensures that those who actually regulate the Sunday School curriculum are those who will both embody and perpetuate bourgeois culture". As Wills points out, this distinguishes her from other philanthropists of the time such as Hannah More.|$|E
500|$|In another Rolling Stone interview, {{the band}} {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} the title track, saying that is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged. Bassist Peter Mosely, in discussion of this, said: [...] "We're older than people think we are. [...] We go through months of serenity, and then there'll be this one night where there will be evil." [...] In another interview discussion about [...] "Lights and Sounds", Key noted that it is [...] "about a band like us coming into a career that we didn't think we'd have. You find yourself surrounded by a lot of false people, {{a lot of people who}} are not doing it for the same reasons you are. That song is about the struggle of not giving in to that." [...] The band explained that the lyrics, [...] "Make it new but stay in the lines / Just let go but keep it inside / Smile big for everyone / Even when you know what they've done / They gave you the end but not where to start / Not how to build, how to tear it apart", were written because of that particular reason. Key also revealed that the lyrics, [...] "They gave you the end / But not where to start / Not how to build / <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> tear it apart", were references to bands Nofx and Bad Religion. Key also explained that when he was preoccupied by distractions, in which he referred to them as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album and track title just that. Key also revealed that it was because that is how it surrounded the band, when working on the album.|$|E

Bella's love and confidence in Edward's restraint cause her to ignore his warnings, even after she becomes the vampire James' target. Unlike the Cullen family, who are [...] "vegetarian" [...] vampires (committed to only feeding on animals), James regularly feeds on humans and will not stop until he drinks Bella's blood. With his family's help, Edward is able to save Bella from James' predations, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> assure Bella's continued safety remains an open question.|$|E
2500|$|Griffith {{held the}} Premier's office until 1888, and {{was made a}} Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1886, before {{receiving}} an advancement to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1895. Griffith {{was regarded as a}} close ally of the labour movement. He introduced a bill to legalise trade unions, and declared that [...] "the great problem of this age is not how to accumulate wealth <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> secure its more equitable distribution". In 1888 his government was defeated. In opposition he wrote radical articles for The Boomerang, William Lane's socialist newspaper.|$|E
2500|$|In a diagramless crossword, {{often called}} a diagramless for short or, in the UK, a {{skeleton}} crossword or carte blanche, the grid offers overall dimensions, but {{the locations of}} most of the clue numbers and shaded squares are unspecified. [...] A solver must deduce not only the answers to individual clues, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> fit together partially built-up clumps of answers into larger clumps with properly set shaded squares. [...] Some of these puzzles follow the traditional symmetry rule, others have left-right mirror symmetry, and others have greater levels of symmetry or outlines suggesting other shapes. [...] If the symmetry of the grid is given, the solver can use it to his/her advantage.|$|E

2500|$|Later that year, Richardson printed Rivington and Osborn's {{book which}} {{inspired}} Pamela {{under the title}} of Letters written to and for particular Friends, {{on the most important}} Occasions. Directing not only the requisite Style and Forms to be observed in writing Familiar Letters; <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> think and act justly and prudently, in the common Concerns of Human Life. The book contained many anecdotes and lessons on how to live, but Richardson did not care for the work and it was never expanded even though it went into six editions during his life. He {{went so far as to}} tell a friend, [...] "This volume of letters is not worthy of your perusal" [...] because they were [...] "intended for the lower classes of people".|$|E
2500|$|On March 22, 1936, Roosevelt {{established}} the Committee on Administrative Management (commonly {{known as the}} Brownlow Committee) and charged it with developing proposals for reorganizing the executive branch. The three-person committee consisted of Louis Brownlow, Charles Merriam, and Luther Gulick. Gulick's POSDCORB served as the basis and framing idea and not all parts of their team's research was used. [...] Their work revealed a profound constitutional understanding and confidence, not only about improving public management, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> improve democracy within the American administrative state. [...] On January 8, 1937, the Committee released its report. Famously declaring [...] "The President needs help," [...] the Committee's report advocated a strong chief executive, including among its 37 recommendations significant expansion of the presidential staff, integration of managerial agencies into a single presidential office, expansion of the merit system, integration of all independent agencies into existing Cabinet departments, and modernization of federal accounting and financial practices.|$|E
2500|$|But {{this was}} not the only thing that changed. The {{constitutional}} conflict about the supremacy of the sovereignty of the Generality over provincial sovereignty, that seemed to be settled by the coup of William II, became [...] "unsettled" [...] again after his death. De Witt of course met opposition from [...] other provinces from time to time, and sometimes Holland was even outvoted in the States General. This posed an unenviable dilemma for De Witt. Although decisions were supposed to be unanimous in the States General, this would in practice be unworkable. The principle of majority voting was therefore accepted by all provinces. On the other hand, Holland could not allow the other provinces to go against its wishes, as the major contributor to the Generality's budget. De Witt was therefore only prepared to accept a majority decision if Holland was in the majority. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> justify this? The solution was to push the old doctrine of the supremacy of provincial sovereignty (as long as it was Holland's sovereignty), first formulated by François Vranck in 1587. And this became the basic constitutional theory of the Republic during the Stadtholderless Era, at least of De Witt'sStates Party.|$|E
