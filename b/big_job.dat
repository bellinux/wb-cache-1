25|$|His fielding {{was almost}} a minus quality. Hassett would be saddled with the {{difficult}} task of hiding him away from busy corners all day long. But the fielding of the team as a whole was thought to be brittle. Moroney...would never be accused of being a mobile unit of the out-cricket, and Ian Johnson was, in my opinion, anyhow, a very doubtful quantity especially as a slip-fieldsman, where he seemed likely to do duty...I sympathized with Hassett over the <b>big</b> <b>job</b> he faced in getting good fielding done with the quality of the manpower as his disposal. There were only five good fieldsmen in the group of twelve chosen. These were Harvey, Miller, Morris, Loxton and Archer, and Archer was the supernumerary.|$|E

It was quite frightening - they had machine guns on the roof. I was also allowed to drive around the perimeter but if you {{got out of the}} car there was a loudspeaker warning you to keep away. There was not a chance of going in it, and I was delighted because I knew from going to the Bank of England vaults that gold isn't stacked very high and it's all underwhelming. It gave me the chance to show the biggest gold repository in the world as I imagined it, with gold going up to heaven. I came up with this cathedral-type design. I had a <b>big</b> <b>job</b> to persuade Cubby and the director Guy Hamilton at first." ...|$|E

500|$|Bible Student Alexander H. Macmillan, {{who served}} as an aide to the {{executive}} committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society's officers approached. He wrote: [...] "A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, doing a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held {{a large number of}} votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office." [...] Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, [...] "Rutherford did not know what was going on. He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but I guess he was doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a <b>big</b> <b>job</b> on his hands ... There is no doubt in our minds that the Lord's will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself {{had nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|E

[...] Again in 2007, she reflected on her role in 1993–1994: [...] "I think that both {{the process and the}} plan were flawed. We were trying to do something that was very hard to do, and we made a lot of mistakes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sidwell {{made his}} last {{appearance}} on-screen as Steven on 9 May 2008, {{and he has}} since revealed that producers {{made the right decision}} in axing his character as his story arc had run its course: [...] "They really did try to keep Steven in. The problem is EastEnders is a realistic show, so with Steven being a larger-than-life character it was always going to be hard having him doing the same crazy things day in, day out. I wasn't expecting to stay on the Square forever. It was my first <b>big</b> <b>job</b> out of drama college and I couldn't have asked for a better start in the industry. I've had a great time and the character isn't being killed off, so who knows what might happen a few years down the line. There's always the possibility I might be asked back one day".|$|E

Before the race Dettori had requested some [...] "lucky white tape" [...] for his stirrup: the tape had previously been used to repair Willie Carson's saddle before his win on Nashwan and had been applied to Dettori's stirrup when he won on Authorized in 2007. Gosden, who was winning the race for the second time, after Benny the Dip's success in 1997, commented [...] "The last thing I said to Frankie was ride a cool race and he rode a cool race—he waited and waited.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} new {{scheduler}} to schedule parallel jobs on Clusters {{that may be}} part of a Computational Grid. This proposed policy proposes 3 Job Queues. In each Cluster, the first Queue has some jobs which are from Computational Grids. It means, it may be either <b>bigger</b> <b>job</b> or part of the <b>bigger</b> <b>job</b> from the Computational Grids. The second Queue has jobs which has low required execution time. The third Queue has jobs which has high required execution time. In first and second Queues, there is no chance of starvation. But in third Queue, there is a chance of starvation. So this proposed policy applied AGING technique to preempt the jobs which has low priority. And the first Queue is fully dedicated to execute a part of <b>bigger</b> <b>jobs</b> (Meta-Jobs) only. So here we maintain three job Queues which are effectively separate jobs according to their required execution time for local <b>Jobs,</b> <b>bigger</b> job/part of bigger job(Meta-Job) from Computational Grids. Here we preempt jobs by applying AGING Technique. Initially 20 % of total available resources (processors) will be allocated to first Queue only. And 40 % of total available resources (processors) will be allocated to second and third queues respectively. Whenever the third queue is Empty then the proposed scheduler simply selects the job which has least required execution time and executes it immediately. In this way, the proposed scheduler increases the throughput in clusters...|$|R
