40|$|The {{fact that}} women are still {{choosing}} to <b>bottlefeed</b> {{in spite of the}} scientific evidence on the benefits of breastfeeding supports further research on the promotion of breastfeeding. The incidence of breastfeeding varies regionally; Newfoundland, where this study was conducted, has the lowest incidence of breastfeeding in Canada. Thus, one problem for nurses in Newfoundland is to find a means to increase the incidence of breastfeeding. The present study examined the relationship between a nursing intervention (information-sharing on infant feeding) and decision-making on an infant feeding method. [...] This descriptive study examined the responses of a convenience sample (n= 18) of primigravidous women to a nursing intervention. Primigravidous women in their third trimester of pregnancy were contacted through prenatal classes of two urban maternity hospitals and general practitioners. [...] The nursing intervention included an initial interview and two information-sharing sessions on infant feeding. The initial interview consisted of an assessment of the woman's knowledge and values of infant feeding, developed by the researcher, and a pre-test investigating attitudes towards infant feeding, developed by Manstead (1984). The two information-sharing sessions covered information on breast and bottle feeding, including feelings, attitudes and practical information about each method of infant feeding. The second information-sharing session concluded with a post-test (a repeat of the pre-test) and feedback from the participants regarding the two sessions. [...] The results concurred with other studies in that (a) information-sharing alone has no significant effect on either a woman's attitudes or intention towards breast or bottle feeding, (b) attitudes are not the only influential factor in a woman's decision to breast or bottle feed, (c) a woman's prenatal intention to breast or <b>bottlefeed</b> is a good indicator of her postnatal choice, and (d) most women, prior to conception or in early pregnancy, have decided on an infant feeding method. [...] One of the assessment tools, Values and Knowledge on Infant Feeding (VKIF), emerged as a potential instrument for practice, education, and research. The tool more clearly delineated the differences between the women with intentions to breastfeed and the women who were either undecided or had intentions to <b>bottlefeed</b> than did the Manstead (1984) tool, A Questionnaire to investigate Attitudes to Infant Feeding (QIAIF). The VKIF tool also indicated the areas that might be potential problems for breastfeeding mothers.

It is important to emphasize that breastfeeding seems to have non-nutritive protective impact.

40|$|Behavior is a {{function}} of values mediated by perception (Dwyer, 1989). Although breastfeeding is both an instinctive and learned mammalian behavior, women throughout the world are increasingly choosing to bottlefeed their offspring rather than breastfeed. Both national and international health organizations recognize that breastfeeding is healthier for infants. There are world-wide efforts to encourage breastfeeding. Afro-American women have had the largest decrease in breastfeeding of American women. This is a comparative study to determine if the behavior of infant feeding choice is related to values, less-conscious values and/or feelings of internal or external belief concerning locus of control. One hundred and twenty-eight (128) pregnant Afro-American women participated in the study. Of the sixty-five (65) who planned to breastfeed, more adolescents and older mothers chose breastfeeding than {{women between the ages of}} eighteen to thirty-four years old. Breastfeeding mothers stated more often that they valued friends, honesty, God, contentment and feeling well.

40|$|The {{breastfeeding}} rate in Hong Kong is low {{compared to}} the rates in Western countries. To understand {{the relative importance of}} different sources of influence on infant feeding practices, 714 Chinese mothers with infants aged 4 weeks to 6 months were studied. It was found that the <b>bottlefeeding</b> mothers were influenced more by the medical professionals who did not support breastfeeding. This influence was further reinforced by the mass media and particularly television advertisements on infant formulae. The successful breastfeeding mothers, on the other hand, were influenced more by their social networks through which they were told of the dangers of <b>bottlefeeding.</b> The failed breastfeeding mothers differed from the other groups in the lack of support they experienced from friends and relatives. Although they received professional encouragement to breastfeed, they were more sheltered from the influence of mass media and social networks. From these findings, it is suggested that different sources of influence are related to different feeding practices. However, to be able to continue with the practice that one has chosen, the availability of social support is essential. Implications of these findings are discussed and several recommendations to promote breastfeeding are made. ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{determined}} {{rates of}} breastfeeding advice given to African American and white women by medical providers and WIC nutrition counselors, {{and sought to}} determine whether racial differences in advice contributed to racial differences in rates of breastfeeding. METHODS: The study used data from the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey, a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of mothers with a live birth, infant death, or fetal death in 1988. The authors compared white women (n= 3, 966) and African American women (n= 4, 791) with a live birth in 1988 on self-reported rates of medical provider and WIC advice to breastfeed, WIC advice to bottlefeed, and breastfeeding. RESULTS: Self-reported racial identification did not predict medical provider advice. However, being African American was associated with less likelihood of breastfeeding advice and greater likelihood of <b>bottlefeeding</b> advice from WIC nutrition counselors. In multivariate analyses controlling for differences in advice, being African American was independently associated with lower breastfeeding rates (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 41, 95 % CI 0. 32, 0. 52).

40|$|One {{hundred and}} fifty mothers of under- 5 {{children}} clinically identified as malnourished were interviewed in their homes in katchi abadis (squatter settlements) of Karachi. A variety of ethnic and religious groups were represented. Mothers were shown {{a photograph of a}} child with third-degree malnutrition (marasmus) and were asked what might be wrong with the child. Virtually all of the mothers said that they had seen the condition, typically identifying it as sukhay ki bimari (Urdu: 'the disease of dryness and thinness'). The majority said that diarrhea predisposed to sukhay ki bimari, and vice versa, but only 3 of the 150 mothers said that diarrhea and/or lack of food could, in themselves, cause the condition. Instead, most said that the usual cause was contact with a woman who had a marasmic child or was otherwise in a state of ritual impurity. The mediating factor was said to be a saya ('shadow, influence') emanating from such a person and ultimately linked with the spirit world. Although the condition was judged to have a very poor prognosis, mothers described various magico-religious therapies that could be tried. Treatment by physicians or by giving more food was considered ineffective or even detrimental, and hiding of such children was reportedly common because of social stigma. Subsequent inquiries carried out by the author in Chitral in northwestern Pakistan produced similar findings except that there, the condition was known as moordasip and was more overtly associated with fright and spirit possession. In Karachi, 45 of the 150 mothers interviewed had children with third-degree malnutrition according to weight-for-age criteria, 15 of whom died {{in the course of the}} study. In these 45 families especially, early <b>bottlefeeding</b> had occurred, sometimes reportedly because of fear that the mother was a carrier of a saya and could pass it on through her milk. Most mothers had only sketchy knowledge of suitable weaning foods and an appropriate timetable for introducing such foods, and many showed little awareness of what their children were eating once they reached the toddler stage. Implications for the identification and treatment of marasmic children are discussed.

The importance of breastfeeding of infants lies not only in its nutritional and hygienic properties, but also because of its immunological effects and its influence in the control of fertility. The literature review is combined with a discussion of aspects of research undertaken by the authors under the headings of length of breastfeeding, <b>bottlefeeding</b> and breastfeeding and fertility. Most of the examples come from Nigeria, but the problems discussed are common to much of the developing world. Under a discussion of social and policy implications, the need for governments in the developing countries to adopt the recent World Health Organisation's code of practice to curtail the sale of artificial infant milks, is stressed.

40|$|Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) {{responsiveness}} to stress is generally blunted in lactating rats, except during situations of pup endangerment, suggesting {{an important role}} of salience of stressor in stress response during lactation. Conversely, in women, breastfeeding is associated with reduced HPA responses to physical stress and perceived stress. Yet, HPA responses to a standardized speech and arithmetic task (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST) are not blunted in breastfeeding mothers. Interestingly, greater number of children (parity) increases maternal experience which can enhance {{responsiveness to}} child-related stressors. To our knowledge, no study to date has investigated the impact of infant feeding type and parity on basal and reactive HPA secretion in human mothers using an emotional stressor evoking threat to a child. Furthermore, no study has investigated the effect of return of ovarian activity, sleep disturbances, education and income even though these variables are function of infant feeding type. Therefore, in STUDY (1) we assessed the impact of infant feeding type (breast vs. bottle) and parity (primiparous, first-time mother vs. multiparous, second-time mother) on diurnal cortisol secretion. Then, in STUDY (2) we verified whether infant feeding upon waking up would affect awakening cortisol response (ACR), an endogenous stimulation of HPA axis. Finally, in STUDY (3) we investigated the impact of infant feeding type, parity and salience of stressor on salivary cortisol and (sympathetic) alpha-amylase responses to laboratory-induced (exogenous) stressors that were either related or unrelated to child well-being (a home-made emotional film evoking lost and hurt children or the TSST). Breastfeeding mothers presented lower estradiol concentrations, more frequent nocturnal sleep interruptions and higher education and income. We found that greater basal cortisol secretion in multiparous <b>bottlefeeding</b> compared to multiparous breastfeeding mothers at awakening and 4 PM, when simultaneous child and infant cares are the most prominent. No impact of breastfeeding was found on ACR. Finally, among multiparous mothers, following both the TSST and the emotional film, cortisol responsiveness in <b>bottlefeeding</b> was greater than in breastfeeding mothers. Alpha-amylase responses were similar across groups. Interestingly, income {{played a role in}} the stability of diurnal cycle, and possibly of ACR across days, but not on laboratory-induced stress responses. No effect of other secondary variables was detected. In conclusion, in this dissertation, we show for the first time that during child-related stress, multiparity accentuates the reduction in basal and reactive HPA activity associated with breastfeeding. Furthermore, the evidence of potential association between high socioeconomic indices and healthier HPA function represent a new avenue for implementing support programs for mothers during the highly emotional and stressful period following childbirth...|$|E

40|$|In urban {{squatter}} settlements and rural villages of Pakistan, human breastmilk {{is regarded as}} a potential source of destruction as well as of nurturance. Though it is highly valued as crucial for infant survival, it is also thought susceptible to becoming tainted in many ways: by a 'shadow' from the spirit world; by 'evil eye' or black magic due to others' envy; by the effects of a new pregnancy; by the mother's illness or 'weakness'; by her exposure to excessive cold or heat; by her dietary indiscretions. In any of these circumstances, women may stop breastfeeding to prevent illness in the nursing child. Sometimes the stoppage is temporary, brief, and has no serious consequences. When the mother is pregnant, however, it is permanent. Further, if a child is sickly, cries a great deal, has prolonged diarrhea, or seems reluctant to suck, mothers frequently become alarmed and suspect irreversible breastmilk 'poisoning. ' In the latter case, a folk healer has traditionally been consulted to test the milk's quality, but in recent years pathology laboratories have increasingly taken on this function in all of the major cities in Pakistan. Not only does the mother stop breastfeeding while the milk is being tested, but often she is unable or unwilling to resume nursing even if the milk is eventually pronounced safe to drink.

One hundred and sixty nine women and eighty-five milk-fed infants took part in this study and were divided into four groups: 1) infants predominantly on breastfeeding (n = 55) and their mothers (n = 55); 2) infants on <b>bottlefeeding</b> (n = 30); 3) non-lactating women on whom oral collections were performed (n = 80) and, 4) non-lactating women on whom breast collections were performed (n = 34). Oral and mammary swabs were cultured on Sabouraud agar dextrose with chloramphenicol. The Candida yeast strains found were isolated and identified through morphological and biochemical tests. Candida species were much less frequent in infants who were predominantly breastfed than in those who were bottlefed. Yeasts were much more frequent on the breasts of lactating women, with statistical difference in relation to the control group. O objetivo do estudo foi verificar a presença de leveduras do gênero Candida na cavidade bucal de lactentes em aleitamento materno predominante e nas bocas e mamas de suas mães, assim como na cavidade bucal de lactentes em aleitamento artificial e em mulheres na ausência de lactação. Participaram do estudo 169 mulheres e 85 lactentes divididos em quatro grupos: 1) crianças em aleitamento natural predominante (n = 55) e suas mães (n = 55); 2) crianças em aleitamento artificial (n = 30); 3) mulheres que não estavam amamentando, em que se realizaram coletas bucais (n = 80) e, 4) mulheres em ausência de lactação em que se realizaram coletas mamárias (n = 34). "Swabs" bucais e mamários, foram semeados em ágar Sabouraud dextrose com cloranfenicol, e as cepas de levedura isoladas foram identificadas utilizando-se provas morfológicas e bioquímicas. Espécies de Candida foram detectadas a partir de um número significativamente menor de crianças em aleitamento natural predominante que de crianças em aleitamento artificial. Também foi significativa a maior freqüência dessas espécies nas mamas de nutrizes em relação ao controle...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [40]- 42) The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Dental Association {{recommend that}} all children be weaned from the bottle by one year of age {{to reduce the risk}} of baby bottle tooth decay. However, little research has been done to find out how many parents are following this recommendation and whether failure to wean at one year creates any health consequences other than the risk of tooth decay. For this thesis, data were collected from the health charts of 360 low-income preschoolers (aged 1 - 4 years) enrolled in the WIC Program of the Cook County Department of Health at Skokie, IL, to determine 1) the age at which most children in fact do wean from the bottle and 2) the relation, if any, of late bottle weaning to weight-for-height and to hemoglobin levels. Examination of the children’s diet histories revealed that the majority of children were still bottle-feeding at age two years and that about 25 % had not yet been bottleweaned at age three years. The incidence of prolonged bottle feeding did not differ between ethnic groups, with the exception of children from Orthodox Jewish families, who were more likely to be breastfed one year or more and less likely to be bottle fed during the preschool years. Among children older than two years, both the incidence of abnormal weights (i. e., weights above the 90 th or below the 10 th percentile as plotted on weight-for-height growth charts) and the incidence of low hemoglobin levels were greater among <b>bottlefeeding</b> children than among the children who no longer fed from bottles. These differences, when examined individually, did not reach significance. However, among children aged 18 - 48 months, prolonged bottle-feeding was significantly associated with adverse health consequences in general. Bottle-fed children were more likely to be “high risk” nutritionally. Among 149 bottle-fed children, 50 % had at least one of the following risk factors: high weight for height or low weight for height, and/or low hemoglobin levels. Among 109 bottle-weaned children, only 37 % had such risk factors (Pearson chi square, p =. 029). More research needs to be done in other WIC clinics to confirm this association between prolonged bottle feeding and adverse health consequences. A more detailed analysis of the diets of bottle-feeding preschoolers may determine whether the bottle habit predisposes children to poor eating habits and an iron-deficient diet. If this link is established, then dietitians must devise more effective ways to motivate parents to bottle wean their children more promptly. Currently, parents appear to be ignoring the public health message to “ban the bottle. ”M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aims of this {{dissertation}} were {{to describe}} trends in child undernutrition in Kenya manifest as poor physical growth, along with trends in feeding care practices, {{and to examine}} socio-demographic correlates of child feeding practices. The dissertation also examined the reliability of socio-demographic variables in predicting initiation of breastfeeding {{within an hour of}} birth. Globally, millions of {{children under the age of}} five die of conditions associated with undernutrition. The effects of undernutrition do not end at child mortality but have pervasive effects on surviving victims. Undernutrition alters normal brain development, reduces energy levels and limits the rate of motor development in children. The aforementioned biological impairments have been linked to over 200 million children in the developing world not achieving their development potential and perpetuating intergenerational poverty. Feeding is, of course, a key child care practice. The pattern of infant and young child feeding that provides most benefit is being put to the breast within an hour of birth, exclusive breastfeeding for six months, continued breastfeeding along with complementary foods up to two years of age or beyond, and avoidance of any <b>bottlefeeding.</b> The data show that many children across the world, and particularly in Kenya, are not fed optimally. Consequently, it was estimated in 2011 that globally, about 804, 000 children die annually due to sub-optimal breastfeeding and a further 44 million disability-adjusted life years are lost. It is perplexing that the world is still grappling with such loss of life and yet the benefits of optimal breastfeeding to the health and development of the child are enormous. The benefits range from physical, motor, cognitive and psychosocial development of the child to a boosted natural immunity against infection and thus scaling down undernutrition. Breastfeeding also has health benefits for the mother and cumulative benefits to the child in its later years, as it is protective against obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Despite knowledge of the pervasive effects of undernutrition and the potential effect of optimal infant and young child feeding practices, little is known about their trends, especially within countries in the global south. Research on trends in child growth and care practices has been hindered by the challenges of changing criteria for classifying child undernutrition and optimal care practices. There has also been an emphasis in the literature on international comparisons of countries’ situations with little attention to within-country trend analyses. There is need for detailed analyses of child growth and care practices over time. In addition, little is known about the reliability of socio-demographic variables in predicting (in statistical terms) child health care outcomes such as initiation of breastfeeding within an hour of birth. Researchers and policy-makers need reliable statistical models that describe the relationship of possible risk and protective factors to child feeding endpoints such as early initiation of breastfeeding. The development of reliable models in which the early initiation of child breastfeeding is in focus is imperative, because this feeding behaviour has such profound consequences for mother and child health. Methods: The study used data from the Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys (KDHS) collected in 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2008 - 09. Analyses in Papers I, II and III were conducted using IBM SPSS version 19. Due to the multi-stage sampling design used by KDHS, the design effect parameters ‘sampling weight’, ‘sample domain’ and ‘sample cluster’ were incorporated in all analyses using SPSS’ Complex Samples Module. Logistic regression was used in data analysis in all the three papers. Child undernutrition was estimated by classifying children as stunted or not (height for age and sex), wasted or not (weight for age and sex) and underweight or not (weight for age and sex) using the most recent recommended WHO growth standards of 2006. To assess child feeding practices, children of ages 0 - 23 months were considered to have been: breastfed early if they were put to breast within one hour after birth, exclusively breastfed if they were fed on nothing else other than breast milk in the last 24 hours prior to the KDHS interview, complementary fed and breastfed if they were given breast milk as well as any solid, semi-solid or soft foods in the last 24 hours, and bottle-fed if a bottle was used for at least part of their feeding in the 24 hours prior to the KDHS interview. Results: Results in paper I showed that the national trends in the prevalence of child underweight declined, while the trends in wasting and stunting were stagnant. Analyses disaggregated by demographic and socio-economic sub-groups revealed some departures from the overall trends. Wasting trends declined more among girls than among boys, and the opposite was true for stunting, with boys posting a greater decline in the prevalence of stunting compared to girls. In paper II, trends in exclusive breastfeeding showed significant improvement in most of socio-demographic sub-groups. Conversely, the trends in early initiation of breastfeeding, complementary feeding and breastfeeding, and bottle-feeding were stagnant or slightly worsening in most socio-demographic sub-groups. Multivariate analysis using the 2008 - 09 data showed that accounting for other variables, the province where the mother resided was the most significant predictor of early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding and bottle-feeding. The main finding in Paper III was that the socio-demographic variables that were significantly related to early initiation of breastfeeding in the multivariate analysis using 1998 data were weakly related in analyses using the 2003 and 2008 - 09 data. Only mode of birth and province of residence reliably predicted early initiation of breastfeeding across the three surveys. Discussion: Results of paper I and II showed stagnating trends in child growth and feeding practices in Kenya but also important departures in the sub-group analyses. The sex differences in child growth were consistent with previous studies from sub-Saharan Africa where growth patterns showed slightly lower prevalence in wasting, stunting and underweight for girls as compared to boys. The evidence on reasons for the gender difference is conflicting. The contribution of this dissertation is to suggest that differences in the early feeding of Kenyan boys and girls are insignificant as a factor in child growth differences, but this requires detailed exploration in further research. Another important finding on trends in paper I and II relates to differences by age in child growth and feeding practices. There was a consistently low prevalence and stable trend in wasting and stunting among youngest children aged 0 - 5 months from 1993 to 2009 and an increasing trend in exclusively breastfed children at the same age. In the older age groups however, trends were not generally improving. It is possible that some aspect of quality of feeding after age 5 months plays a role in this pattern, and further research is desirable on this aspect of child care in Kenya. Consistent in the three papers, trends in child growth and care practices differed by province of residence, highlighting the importance of province as a contextual/distal factor in analyses of child growth and feeding practices trends. An analysis in paper III of the reliability of the association between socio-economic and demographic variables and child feeding confirmed that province of residence was a reliable predictor of timing of initiation of breastfeeding over time, but this was not true for other socio-economic and demographic variables. This calls for detailed research at the intra-province level, to illuminate the aspects of provincial living that impact child growth and care. This is a central conclusion of this dissertation: if we can better understand how ‘place’ affects child growth and care, we might be able to fine tune health promotion interventions to make them more sensitive to features of various places – with place referring to province-of-residence, but perhaps also levels of locality much nearer the household. </p...|$|E
