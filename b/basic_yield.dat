Within a pure nonphotoperiodic var. of Phaseolus vulgaris described as determinate, under controlled conditions, a natural though narrow variability appears in the no. of nodes on the main stem. Linked to this no., a clear morphological acropetal gradient to flowering is expressed by the central axillary branches. The vegetative activity of the main stem apex can be slightly extended by the very early removal of the primary leaves. This results in a longer vegetative structure before the main stem terminal raceme, and in a much more important vegetative structure on the central axillary branches. Reversions to vegetative organogenesis can be observed on the last ones. When this treatment is delayed, the mentioned effect disappears on the main stem; it is less marked on the central branches and concentrated at the upper axils. These results throw new light on the way to consider the differences in growth habit and yield potential. (AS...|$|E

40|$|HBR's 90 th anniversary is a {{sensible}} time to revisit a basic question: Are organizations {{more likely to}} succeed if they adopt good management practices? The answer may seem obvious to most HBR readers, but these three economists cast their net much wider than that. In a decade long study of thousands of organizations in 20 countries, they and their interview team assessed how well manufacturers, schools, and hospitals adhere to three management basics: targets, incentives, and monitoring. They found that huge numbers of companies follow none of those fundamentals, that adopting the <b>basics</b> <b>yields</b> big improvements in outcomes such as productivity and longevity, and that good nuts-and-bolts management at individual firms shapes national performance. At 14 textile manufacturers in India, for example, an intervention-involving free, high-quality advice from a consultant who was on-site half-time for five months-cut defects by half, reduced inventory by 20 %, and raised output by 10 %. A control group saw no such gains. The authors' global data set suggests that implementing good management at schools and hospitals yields change more slowly than at manufacturers-but it does come eventually. And the macroeconomic potential-for incomes, productivity, and delivery of critically needed services-is huge. A call for "better management" may sound prosaic, but given the global payoffs,it's actually quite radical...|$|R

During the vegetation the number of plants, the number of sprouts and the number of spikes was recorded using a quarter tape. The data are in the results section and are converted to 1 m 2. Additionally, the infestation by diseases, pests and overrunning with weeds was monitored. Before harvesting, the samples were taken for an evaluation of the number of grains per spike and HTZ. In the results section the main factors of the yield are statistically evaluated. These include the number of spikes, the number of grains per spike and HTZ.

These species are largely inter-fertile and each displays a series of distinctive characteristics in terms of numerous botanical features and, more importantly, in their agronomic performance, adaptability and overall fiber quality. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from an inter-specific cross between Gh and Gb, used previously for QTL mapping of fiber quality characteristics, has also been evaluated over 6 sites and 2 years for various plant morphological, phenological and yield component traits. A total of 27 traits were assessed across a varying number of locations (up to 6 locations, in Australia, USA, Brazil, Cameroon, Belgium and France) and years, representing up to 10 different combinations. Variability {{in many of these}} traits was observed among the RILs and they frequently showed transgression. One hundred and sixty six significant QTLs, covering the 27 traits, were detected by composite interval mapping when using individual datasets. Cases of confirmation of localizations of individual QTLs from different data sets were detected in 27 instances, indicating that the 166 individual QTLs in this study could be represented by a maximum of 121 chromosome positions. QTL were shared between traits related to hairiness (22 individual QTLs), plant morphology of vegetative (29 QTLs) and reproductive (37 QTLs) parts, phenology (17 QTLs), and yield-related traits (61 QTLs). This is the first report of QTL mapping in cotton for various within-boll yield-related traits assessed on a per-seed basis, including fiber mass per unit of seed surface area (5 QTLs), calculated number of fibers per seed (2 QTLs) or per unit of seed surface area (1 QTL).

30|$|Pressure is {{the driving}} force of the {{filtration}} process (Pabby et al. 2009). The fraction of the feed stream that passes through the membrane is called the “permeate” or “filtrate.” The fraction that does not pass through the membrane is called the “retentate” or the “concentrate” (Crespo and Böddeker 1994). In the case of sodium lactate filtration for the production of LA, the feed stream is the fermentation broth from either a batch or a continuous fermentation process (Carrère et al. 2001). It has a high sodium lactate (61, 800  ppm) and a medium macromolecule concentration. The permeate has a medium sodium lactate (57, 000  ppm) and a low macromolecule concentration. The retentate has a low sodium lactate (35, 300  ppm) and a high macromolecule concentration (Laube et al. 2016 a). The retentate, {{in the case of the}} continuous process, is either recycled back to the fermenter, along with the LA bacteria, or forwarded to another membrane separator (Kamm et al. 2008). This procedure is repeated until a low lactate concentration of around 35, 300  ppm is reached in the retentate stream. The permeate is further processed and not recycled to the fermenter. As a consequence, the macromolecules contained in the fermenter are continuously concentrated (Sikder et al. 2012). There is a wide range of cross-flow filtration modules available on the market, and the appropriate module depends on the size and type of the macromolecules, particles, and solutes contained in the feed (Porter 1990). Laboratory experiments, with just the plane membrane film, can yield only a little information on the performance of the later constructed membrane module, such as the <b>basic</b> <b>yield</b> of a given molecule, making pilot plant experiments under production conditions mandatory (Koschuh et al. 2005). For separation technologists to choose the right membrane, they have to explore individually how each membrane best performs the clarification task in the given process (Gautam and Menkhaus 2014).|$|E

Merr. stem termination types (indeterminate, semideterminate, determinate) to supplemental irrigation during seed growth. The second was done in Costa Rica from February to May (field) and from August to November (glasshouse), 1982. The objective of the second study was to evaluate the response of water stress of tropical determinate and indeterminate soybean cultivars. Because of their ability to continue growth during early reproduction, indeterminates should recover from stress better and respond better to irrigation;The nonirrigated Iowa soybean crop had lower predawn and midday water potentials during seed filling and significantly lower yield than the irrigated soybean crop. However, {{there was no difference in}} response of the stem termination types to supplemental irrigation. Average yield response to irrigation was 16. 4 %. Seed yield increase in response to irrigation of determinates and semideterminates was mostly due to increased number of pods per node, whereas, with indeterminates, it resulted partly from increased pods per node and partly from increased nodes. Indeterminates grew more and lodged more under irrigation than did semideterminates; the determinate types did not lodge at all;The study conducted in Costa Rica showed that field-grown soybean plants under stress had predawn water potentials within - 0. 1 to - 0. 2 MPa of well-watered controls after water had been withheld one week. Stomata showed the greatest decrement in water vapor conductance at water potentials between - 1. 3 and - 1. 4 MPa. Under moderate to severe stress, stomata on the adaxial surface completely closed early in the drying cycle;Indeterminate cultivars were better able to recover from water stress than were determinate ones, as indicated by better seed yield under field conditions.
