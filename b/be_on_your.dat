5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

Comedian actor Will Forte made his fourth appearance in the show, having guest starred as a different character in the February 1, 2007, episode [...] "Black Tie" [...] from the show's first season. In the previous season, Forte played Jenna Maroney's boyfriend and Jenna impersonator.

Tina Fey, the series creator and lead actress on 30 Rock, was the head writer on SNL from 1999 until 2006. In June 2010, Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna, confirmed that Forte would reprise his role as her boyfriend in the upcoming season.

But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we canâ€™t otherwise access. And we think that if itâ€™s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walterâ€™s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and itâ€™s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "Itâ€™s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but donâ€™t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{narrative}} in 2 Samuel 1 {{also contains a}} narrative which is often interpreted as false testimony. The 1 Samuel narrative had described Saul as killing himself by falling on his own sword after having been wounded by the Philistines on Mount Gilboa and being in a situation with no hope of victory or escape. However, 2 Samuel tells of an Amalekite, who was probably on Mount Gilboa to strip the dead of their possessions, appearing to David with Saulâ€™s crown and royal arm band and giving testimony that he had himself killed king Saul. [...] David immediately ordered that the Amalekite be put to death, saying, [...] "Your blood <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, 'I have killed the â€™s anointed.'" [...] The truth of the Amalekiteâ€™s testimony {{did not need to}} be determined for the sentence to be carried out: either the Amalekite had killed King Saul, or he had given false testimony to David regarding Saulâ€™s death. [...] Both crimes were seen as [...] equally deserving of the death penalty.|$|E
2500|$|After {{six years}} since his last studio album, in 1997 Taylor {{released}} Hourglass, an introspective album {{that gave him}} the best critical reviews in almost twenty years. The album had much of its focus on Taylor's troubled past and family. [...] "Jump Up Behind Me" [...] paid tribute to his father's rescue of him after The Flying Machine days, and the long drive from New York City {{back to his home}} in Chapel Hill. [...] "Enough To <b>Be</b> <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> Way" [...] was inspired by the alcoholism-related death of his brother Alex earlier in the decade. The themes were also inspired by Taylor and Walker's divorce, which took place in 1996. Rolling Stone Magazine found that [...] "one of the themes of this record is disbelief", while Taylor told the magazine that it was [...] "spirituals for agnostics". Critics embraced the dark themes on the album, and Hourglass was a commercial success, reaching No. 9 on the Billboard 200 (Taylor's first Top 10 album in sixteen years) and also provided a big adult contemporary hit on [...] "Little More Time With You". The album also gave Taylor his first Grammy since JT, when he was honored with Best Pop Album in 1998.|$|E
2500|$|Guests {{included}} on the album were initially confirmed as Justin Timberlake, Chris Brown, Drake, Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, T.I., Swizz Beatz, Grace Jones, Bilal and Wiz Khalifa but the final track list also included Skylar Grey.

She said [...] "I know when Kalenna and I speak, we sometimes feel giddy because people like pioneers of the game said, 'You know what? We want to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> album,'". Richard also defended the number of guests on the album stating that it was a [...] "labor of love" [...] which is why the group felt like the album needed a [...] "stunning introduction" [...] to the world. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly said the role of the guests on the album [...] " [...] assorted suave fellows... help fill out 's side of the conversation." [...] Vogue was first to reveal that editors and fashion designers have recorded vocal segues for the album. Among those set to feature on the album are Isaac Mizrahi, AndrÃ© Leon Talley, Zac Posen, Marc Jacobs, Anna Wintour (editor in chief at Vogue) and Tommy Hilfiger.
