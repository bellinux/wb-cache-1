3000|$|One of the {{standard}} problems in statistics is to decide between two alternative explanations for the data are observed. For example, a transmitter will send an information on the WSN <b>bits</b> <b>by</b> <b>bits</b> in communication systems. There are two possible cases for each transmission: one is that bit 0 of WSN data is sent (noted as event H_ 0) {{and the other is}} that bit 1 of WSN data is sent (noted as event H_ 1). In the receiver side, the bit y is to be received as either 0 or 1. Based on the y bit of WSN data received, we can make a hypothesis whether the event H_ 0 happens (bit 0 was sent at the transmitter) or the event H_ 1 happens (i.e. bit 1 was sent at the transmitter). Of course, we may make mis-judgement, such as we decode that bit 0 was sent but actually bit 1 was sent. We need to make the probability of error in hypothesis testing as low as possible and the LDPs for CGRG models can help us specify the probability of error.|$|R

South of these, the Hindu state of Carnatic or Vijayanagar still survived; but this, too, was defeated, at the Battle of Talikota (1565) by a league of the Muslim powers. Berar had already been annexed by Ahmednagar in 1572, and Bidar was absorbed by Bijapur in 1619.

Cixi thus took on part of the role usually given to the Bureaucratic Affairs Department (吏部). Cixi had two prominent officials executed to serve as examples for others: Qingying, a military shilang who had tried to bribe his way out of demotion, and He Guiqing, then Viceroy of Liangjiang, who fled Changzhou in the wake of an incoming Taiping army instead of trying to defend the city.|$|E

25|$|After the Great Northern War at the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, Sweden encouraged the foundation of villages on its territories by tax exemptions. As a result, a few isolated villages were established in the forest of Skuleskogen, but none in today's park. Until the middle of the 18th century, logging was limited to the area directly around the villages and thus only minimally affected the forest of the park. But that soon changed, the state taking an active part in the exploitation of the forest. Logging became the principal activity in the area of the park. In a few years, a dozen mills, including a steam mill, were constructed in immediate proximity to today's park. The sawmills driven by water wheels only had weak capacities in general and only functioned during certain periods of the year. The number of steam mills grew thereafter. At first, only the trees with trunks over a fixed length in diameter were able to be cut, but <b>bit</b> <b>by</b> <b>bit,</b> these rules changed, and in the end all the trees were able to be felled. Logging slowed down markedly at the turn of the century, allowing the forest to regenerate. About 15% of the forest was affected by a new period of exploitation before the protection of the area. The forest's oldest trees therefore date from the start of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Gene {{nomenclature}} {{and protein}} nomenclature are not separate endeavors; they are {{aspects of the}} same whole. Any name or symbol used for a protein can potentially {{also be used for}} the gene that encodes it, and vice versa. But owing to the nature of how science has developed (with knowledge being uncovered <b>bit</b> <b>by</b> <b>bit</b> over decades), proteins and their corresponding genes have not always been discovered simultaneously (and not always physiologically understood when discovered), which is the largest reason why protein and gene names do not always match, or why scientists tend to favor one symbol or name for the protein and another for the gene. Another reason {{is that many of the}} mechanisms of life are the same or very similar across species, genera, orders, and phyla, so that a given protein may be produced in many kinds of organisms; and thus scientists naturally often use the same symbol and name for a given protein in one species (for example, mice) as in another species (for example, humans). Regarding the first duality (same symbol and name for gene or protein), the context usually makes the sense clear to scientific readers, and the nomenclatural systems also provide for some specificity by using italic for a symbol when the gene is meant and plain (roman) for when the protein is meant. Regarding the second duality (a given protein is endogenous in many kinds of organisms), the nomenclatural systems also provide for at least human-versus-nonhuman specificity by using different capitalization, although scientists often ignore this distinction, given that it is often biologically irrelevant.|$|E
