40|$|The binding {{of genetically}} {{engineered}} Family II cellulose binding domains (CBDs) of Cellumonas fimi cellulases to cotton fabrics was studied and possible textile applications were investigated. Family II CBDs bound to cotton cellulose increased dye affinity, especially for acid dyes, but with very poor washing fastness. Ironing of the protein <b>bound</b> <b>fabrics</b> before dyeing increases dye affinity, which is probably due to protein denaturation and thus increases exposition of ionic groups. For desorption of CBD proteins from the cotton fabric, high levels of mechanical agitation and alkaline conditions (pH > 7) are necessary. Binding of Family II CBDs to cellulose releases fine particles, whereas migration and desorption did not. Long time storage of cotton fabrics with adsorbed CBD proteins did not cause changes in their physical properties and did not damage cotton cellulose. The presence {{of water on the}} surface of cellulose was found to be essential for the interfabric migration of Family II CBDs. The double binding cellulose domain binds strongly on cotton and their interfabric migration is smaller. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

A single dye which dyes all the textile material (fiber) is not made yet. In present study acid dye was used for silk fabric because silk is a protein fiber so acid dye is excellent for printing and Indalca gum is stable in both acidic and alkaline conditions so {{it is good for}} printing with acid dye on silk. Applying colour on fabric in different shape or design is textile printing. In textile printing colour is <b>bounded</b> with <b>fabric.</b> Various printing style were used for printing.

40|$|The Greater Berlin Competition of 1910 {{signals a}} key {{transformation}} in the conception of the city. For the first time, the city was no longer drawn as a continuous <b>bounded</b> urban <b>fabric,</b> but {{as a set of}} linked and dispersed urban components distributed across the region. The competition drawings show the beginnings of a set of principles that architectural history usually attributes to modernism: a shared programme to plan the city as a linked but differentiated system of social, technical and biological functions. This paper traces lines of continuity between the urban vision of Hermann Jansen, one of the two joint competition winners, and subsequent planning thought, in particular the ‘Zehlendorfer Plan’ of 1947. It argues that Jansen can be understood as having initiated the concept of the strategic urban plan—his ‘skeleton’ of urban growth—that can adapt and change according to need, and in negotiation with a range of disciplines and stakeholders. Jansen saw the residential quarter as a distinct component of this growth, which could be resolved at a different moment in time, by a different set of expertise. The ‘Zehlendorfer Plan’ exemplified this flexible adaptable form of planning in which the drawing serves as an instrument of negotiation...|$|R
50|$|The {{economy of}} Sambalpur District is {{basically}} dependent on agriculture and secondly on forests. Forests {{play an important}} role in the economy in terms of contribution to revenue, Domestic Product as well as dependence of people for livelihood. The people living adjacent to the reserved forests of Sambalpur Forest Division are heavily dependent on these forests. In the past Sambalpur has been a great centre of diamond trade. Kendu leaf (Diospyros Melanoxylon) is also produced in Sambalpur. Tendu leaf is one of the most important non-wood forest products of Sambalpur and is also called as green gold of Odisha. Lately industrialisation has started in the district and the prime industries of power, alumina and steel have been established. The place is famous for its globally renowned textile <b>bounded</b> patterns and <b>fabrics</b> locally known as Baandha. Sambalpur is famous for its Hand loom textile works. Popularly known as Sambalpuri Textile. It has earned international fame for its unique pattern, design and texture. Apart from textiles, Samabalpur has a rich tribal heritage and fabulous forestlands.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAnalyses of {{influence}} of different heat transfer modes on temperature distributions in the firefighter's multi-layer protective clothing, skin and muscle were carried out. The system under consideration was irradiated from an external source of thermal radiation {{and consisted of}} several fabrics separated by thin air gaps and the tissue made of several sublayers. Simulations were performed by applying the in-house 1 D numerical model which accounted for coupled heat conduction and thermal radiation in the protective clothing with the associated phase transition of the <b>bound</b> water in <b>fabric</b> fibers and diffusion of water vapor in fabrics and air spaces {{as well as for}} heat conduction, thermal radiation and blood flow in the tissue. Complex thermal and mass transfer conditions at the internal and external boundaries were proposed. Special attention was paid to modelling of non-grey thermal radiation penetrating the clothing and being absorbed by the tissue. The results obtained were used to estimate influence of different heat transfer modes present in the system, on temperature distribution in the clothing and tissue and on variation of times needed to reach the I, II and III degree burns...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe plastic {{behavior}} of granular materials {{is governed by}} unilateral contact interactions and steric exclusions. These features are thus essential in modeling the internal friction, dilatanacy and fabric states. We present a general framework for fabric evolution with the guiding idea that a physical plastic model of granular materials should be based {{in the first place}} on low-order parameters pertaining to the granular microstructure but accounting more or less strictly for steric exclusions as well as the mechanical equilibrium of the particles. We introduce a fabric tensor that, by combining the coordination number and fabric anisotropy, allows for a simple tensorial representation of the fabric states by means of Mohr circles. We discuss the way low-order fabric is induced by homogeneous shearing. Finally, a model will be introduced for the evolution of fabric states with the strain-rate tensor. This model predicts the existence of a steady state, which provides in this way a geometrical interpretation of the critical state as a " saturated " or " jammed " state, and an exponential evolution of the fabric variables during transients. It also predicts the range of accessible fabric states and an upper <b>bound</b> on the <b>fabric</b> anisotropy. By means of numerical simulations, we show that this model works under complex loading paths...|$|R
60|$|As I {{drew near}} the outer {{shore of the}} island, {{opposite}} to the wreck, I came unexpectedly on Marble. The poor fellow was seated on a raised projection of coral rock, with his arms folded, and, was in so thorough a brown study, {{that he did not}} even hear my footsteps in approaching, though I purposely trod heavily, in order to catch his ear. Unwilling to disturb him, I stood gazing at the wreck myself, for some little time, the place affording a much better view of it than any other point from which it had met my eye. The French had made far greater inroads upon their vessel, than the elements. She had struck to leeward of the island, and lay in a spot where, indeed, it might take years to break her entirely up, in that placid sea. Most of her upper works, however, were gone; and I subsequently discovered that her own carpenters had managed to get out even a portion of her floor-timbers, leaving the <b>fabric</b> <b>bound</b> together by those they left. Her lower masts were standing, but even her lower yards had been worked up, in order to make something useful for the schooner. The beach, at no great distance, was still strewed with objects brought from the reef, and which it had not yet been found necessary to use.|$|R
40|$|A {{non-woven}} capillary matting fabric (Tex-R® Pro), {{coated with}} a latex polymer-based formulation of cupric hydroxide (Spin Out®), developed to cover standing-out areas for weed control and to prevent rooting through, was assessed for its potential to reduce the spread of Phytophthora root rot in container-grown hardy nursery-stock. As well as production bed covers, the fabric was cut into discs and (a) used to cover the tops of plant containers (pot toppers) and (b) inserted to cover {{the holes in the}} bottoms of plant containers (disc inserts). These were all tested as barriers to the passage of infective zoospores of Phytophthora cryptogea in enclosed re-circulating irrigation systems growing test plants of Chamaecyparis lawsoniana. Bed covers and disc inserts significantly reduced disease spread, as indicated by the incidence of symptoms and infection, and by bait and colony-forming unit tests of re-circulating water, both in overhead- and trickle-irrigated systems. Pot toppers were not effective. This may be explained by the mode of spread of Phytophthora in such irrigation systems, which appears to be largely via capillary water and therefore not intercepted by toppers. These results were supported by in vitro studies on the passage of zoospores through fresh and used fabric samples which showed that all Tex-R Pro fabric materials significantly reduced the survival of zoospores and zoospore cysts (to between 0 % and 4. 8 %) compared with untreated fabrics (between 32. 3 % and 42. 8 %). Analysis of Cu 2 + concentrations in re-circulating irrigation water and in matting samples {{at the end of the}} field experiments showed that the majority of the active ingredient stayed <b>bound</b> to the <b>fabric.</b> These results demonstrate that it is possible to deploy Spin Out-treated fabrics in nurseries to help prevent the spread of Phytophthora propagules in addition to their primary use for controlling weeds and rooting through...|$|R
40|$|I am a {{textiles}} {{artist who}} has become interested in book arts, as have many others. In looking for historic precedents, I was amazed to learn {{that there was a}} history of books <b>bound</b> in fine <b>fabric</b> dating back to medieval Europe. These are rich, elaborately crafted objects that required binders to collaborate with craft persons skilled in needlework. Beautifully woven fabrics were used, some of which were made for clothing. Other fabrics had been made for smaller, more durable objects like books or perhaps hats and handbags. There are records of milliners making some of the bindings. The appearance and ownership of the rich volumes I 2 ̆ 7 m about to show you reflect the status and power associated with the ownership of silk, books and. thus knowledge, in earlier times. Textile bindings exist in small numbers in relation to leather books. There are several reasons for this. The books are fragile and many have disintegrated. Some religious books were destroyed during the Reformation; others were dismantled at various times to reclaim precious gemstones and metals. Many books bound in cloth were rebound in earlier times for conservation reasons. Finally, tastes changed, and book historians did not consider the textiles bindings worthy of study. Perhaps the bindings were considered woman 2 ̆ 7 s work, and not as important as the popular Moroccan leather books that followed. This paper begins by looking at books in British and French Collections of the Middle Ages and somewhat beyond. Each country 2 ̆ 7 s descriptions start with velvet bindings, and moves on to embroidered bindings. Some of the bindings feature abstract designs, similar to those seen on leather bindings, others are pictorial. Geometric designs and the tools that make them can be reused in different configurations on different titles. This is not always the case with pictorial representations, which also require more skill to execute. ] However, many of the pictorial bindings feature portraits of the owner, or broad religious themes and are more interchangeable than one might think...|$|R
40|$|Through geochemical {{analyses}} of produced waters, petrophysics, and reservoir simulation we developed concepts and approaches for mitigating unwanted water production in tight gas reservoirs and for increasing recovery of gas resources presently considered noncommercial. Only new completion research (outside {{the scope of}} this study) will validate our hypothesis. The first task was assembling and interpreting a robust regional database of historical produced-water analyses to address the production of excessive water in basin-centered tight gas fields in the Greater Green (GGRB) and Wind River basins (WRB), Wyoming. The database is supplemented with a sampling program in currently active areas. Interpretation of the regional water chemistry data indicates most produced waters reflect their original depositional environments and helps identify local anomalies related to basement faulting. After the assembly and evaluation phases of this project, we generated a working model of tight formation reservoir development, based on the regional nature and occurrence of the formation waters. Through an integrative approach to numerous existing reservoir concepts, we synthesized a generalized development scheme organized around reservoir confining stress cycles. This single overarching scheme accommodates a spectrum of outcomes from the GGRB and Wind River basins. Burial and tectonic processes destroy much of the depositional intergranular fabric of the reservoir, generate gas, and create a rock volume marked by extremely low permeabilities to gas and fluids. Stress release associated with uplift regenerates reservoir permeability through the development of a penetrative grain <b>bounding</b> natural fracture <b>fabric.</b> Reservoir mineral composition, magnitude of the stress cycle and local tectonics govern the degree, scale and exact mechanism of permeability development. We applied the reservoir working model to an area of perceived anomalous water production. Detailed water analyses, seismic mapping, petrophysics, and reservoir simulation indicate a lithologic and structural component to excessive in situ water permeability. Higher formation water salinity was found to be a good pay indicator. Thus spontaneous potential (SP) and resistivity ratio approaches combined with accurate formation water resistivity (Rw) information may be underutilized tools. Reservoir simulation indicates significant infill potential in the demonstration area. Macro natural fracture permeability was determined to be a key element affecting both gas and water production. Using the reservoir characterization results, we generated strategies for avoidance and mitigation of unwanted water production in the field. These strategies include (1) more selective perforation by improved pay determination, (2) using seismic attributes to avoid small-scale fault zones, and (3) utilizing detailed subsurface information to deliberately target optimally located small scale fault zones high in the reservoir gas column. Tapping into the existing natural fracture network represents opportunity for generating dynamic value. Recognizing the crucial role of stress release in the natural generation of permeability within tight reservoirs raises the possibility of manmade generation of permeability through local confining stress release. To the extent that relative permeabilities prevent gas and water movement in the deep subsurface a reduction in stress around a wellbore has the potential to increase the relative permeability conditions, allowing gas to flow. For this reason, future research into cavitation completion methods for deep geopressured reservoirs is recommended...|$|R
