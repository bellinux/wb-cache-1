5000|$|Denman {{designed}} {{the building in}} a [...] "well-mannered but individual Neo-Georgian style". The walls are of red brick with some Portland stonework. The brickwork is laid in the stretcher <b>bond</b> pattern. The <b>roof,</b> {{in which there is}} attic space, is laid with pantiles. The façade is symmetrical, consisting of five bays each with one window on the first and second floors. At ground-floor level, there are entrances in the outermost bays flanking three large round-headed windows, all recessed into a slightly projecting stone-faced section. The windows above the entrances are taller than the others and have pediments above them supported on corbels. The other windows are plain sashes, although those at second-floor level have bands and panels of brick around them. Below the attic storey is a stone cornice topped by a brick parapet with decorative urns at each end. The mansard roof, in which three dormer windows are set, [...] "gives a Scandinavian air". An elaborate clock with a decorative case projects prominently from the façade at first-floor level.|$|R
5000|$|The unusual {{architectural}} style of St Richard's Church {{has been described}} as having elements of Art Deco and the Scandinavian style. [...] It is also built almost entirely of reinforced concrete—not often found in British churches, but used here on the advice of the Diocese as a cost-saving measure. [...] The church is cruciform, long and low; ribs of reinforced concrete run along its length. [...] The nave is of five bays and has north and south aisles; the chancel has a further three bays; the north transept houses a side chapel, organ gallery and seating for the choir; and there is a baptistery in the south transept, which also has the entrance door. Outside, the entrance area has a steep gabled roof with a small weatherboarded bell-turret: this was provided instead of a tower or steeple. [...] Between the roof and the door is a tall round-arched window. The exterior is of locally-made brick laid in the English <b>bond</b> pattern. The <b>roof</b> is tiled and very steeply pitched. [...] There is some stained glass, but the east side has no window at all: it is decorated with a tiled crucifix. [...] Internal fittings include an intricately carved eagle's-head lectern commemorating the end of the First World War, oak pews, stone font, stone and oak pulpit, altar rails and a piscina.|$|R
5000|$|The Square & Compasses {{who use the}} defunct red {{telephone}} box in Fuller Street {{to display}} paths and other useful local walking information. Buildings and Design Features The settlement {{has a number of}} large detached houses set in mature grounds with both native hedging and brick wall perimeter enclosures. Of special interest is The Stores, a Grade 2 house, built in circa 1590, converted to a shop and house in the 19th century, and back to a house in the 20th century. Timber framed, plastered, roofed with handmade red clay tiles, it has one 19th century half-glazed door and one plain boarded door. The shop front retains a 19th-century three directional sign reading 'Lifebuoy Soap - Sunlight Soap - No wear no tear no care' made by Roots and Heinemann of Connersville, Indiana, under a patent of 1888 and a clasped purlin roof, with original partitions infilled with wattle and daub to apex. Also found is Fairstead Lodge, a Grade 2 listed house, built in the early 19th century of red brick in Flemish <b>bond</b> and <b>roofed</b> with handmade red clay tiles and The Herons, a Grade 2 house from the 17th century. Timber framed, plastered, roofed with slate and handmade red clay tiles this has been two cottages previously and a six bay wagon lodge from the early 19th century which is timber framed, weather boarded and roofed with slate. The houses, built by Braintree Rural District Council (pre 1974 council changes), leading into the village are of two storey semi detached constructions some with red brick elevations, some with rendered elevations under concrete tile roofs; the windows were originally of the [...] "Crittall" [...] metal type but have largely been replaced with UPVC. These dwellings have off-road parking spaces but the natural hedging at the perimeter boundaries has been maintained The operational scaffold commercial premises and yard storage areas are of unremarkable steel framed construction clad in a mixture of materials; the perimeter boundaries are more suited for security than visual harmony to their rural setting, especially close to listed buildings, although the hedging and brick construction have been maintained for the commercial car repair business. Areas of open countryside come into the centre of the hamlet, which contribute to its essential character, which is recognised by the Planning Inspectorate as a character asset in Ranks Green There is no village envelope. I believe the Council Houses {{on the top of the}} hill were built in about 1929 and the out buildings at the same time...the brick buildings further up were built in about 1938, and the old garage and house round about 1935.F.H.S.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main house}} at Upper Brandon is a five bay center hall, red brick {{structure}} {{built in the}} Federal style with a low hip roof with a widows walk. The design of the mansion and its woodwork was influenced by The American Builder's Companion by Asher Benjamin. Due to similarities in construction {{it is believed that}} the itinerant craftsmen involved in its construction may be responsible for several other equally important contemporary Virginia houses including Magnolia Grange, in Chesterfield County.; Hampstead, in New Kent County; Horn Quarter, King William County.; the [...] Governor's Mansion in Richmond; and 19th century alterations to the 18th century mansion at lower Brandon. The house is a large Tidewater rectangular dwelling with a center hall and four corner rooms repeated in the basement and on the second floor with approximately 3,756 square feet. The smaller dependencies had similar configurations with the kitchen on the west combining the hall and cooking area. This five-part palladian form was well established among the grander Virginia plantations. The brickwork is Flemish <b>bond,</b> and the <b>roof</b> is slate; smaller bricks were used to construct the dependencies. Classical porches complete the two facades using the Ionic order on the south land entrance and the Composite order on the north river entrance. The two matching three bay dependencies at either end that are connected to the main structure by low hyphens that are partially below grade. [...] William Byrd Harrison and his family lived there until the outbreak of the Civil War. After the Civil War, William Byrd Harrison never returned to live at Upper Brandon and upon his death in 1870, the plantation was purchased by his nephew, George Harrison Byrd. In 1948, the last Harrison descendant, Francis Otway Byrd, sold the estate to Petersburg businessman Harry C. Thompson.|$|R
40|$|A {{building}} integrated photovoltaic thermal (BIPVT) {{system based}} on long-run metal roofing is being developed at the University of Waikato in partnership with Dimond Ltd., a long-run roof product manufacturer. The concept consists of a CNC folded metal roofing sheet with a central channel and a collector plate <b>bonded</b> to the <b>roofing</b> sheet to create a sealed channel for thermal fluid flow. PV laminates are bonded to the collector plate and inlet and outlet manifolds attached for thermal fluid distribution. When exposed to solar radiation the system generates heat and electricity for domestic and industry use. BIPVT manufacturing methods were investigated for creating the sealed channel for thermal fluid flow. Adhesives (ADH), resistance seam welding (RSW) and autoclaving (ATC) were considered the most suitable. Processes were designed for the three methods and investigated through economic analysis. ATC {{was found to be}} the best for production volumes greater than 20, 000 BIPVT panels per year as it has greater production capacity and lower capital investment payback time than ADH and RSW. ATC had a payback time of 0. 26 years for 90, 000 BIPVT panels per year at a 40 % mark up. However ATC has several technical challenges that need to be overcome whereas ADH and RSW are proven production methods. ADH is more suitable for low production volumes below 20, 000 panels per year as it has a low capital cost compared to RSW and ATC and can be readily optimised when increased production is required. Cost savings can be achieved by reducing material costs as they were 95 % of the total operating costs for all methods. ADH and RSW could be readily optimised to increase production at lower capital expenditure by installing additional equipment at production bottlenecks rather than installing new production lines. ATC could not be as readily optimised as it has high production capacities. Installing a low volume BIPVT production facility into Dimond Ltd. could potentially generate an additional $ 3. 5 million per year in profit, for a process that produces 7, 680 panels a year. Payback time for the capital investment including a PV laminator would be just over half a year making BIPVT an attractive possibility...|$|R
