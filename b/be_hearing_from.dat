Heather Phares of Allmusic gave a negative review for the song, claiming it [...] "falls especially flat as the album's final song", with the album losing stream at the end, and NME's Priya Elan considered that if [...] "the pop dreams get slightly tarnished by the graffiti put-downs of 'Not Big' and 'Alfie', then that's not too worrying, as with a personality this size, this isn’t the last time you’ll <b>be</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> [...] ". It was considered by reviewer Ronan Hunt-Murphy from Two Way Monologues that the song {{could be used for}} a children's TV show, if the swearing and drug references were cut.|$|E

The frame for the painting was found on security chief Lyle W. Grindle's chair near the front desk. The thieves made two trips to their car with artwork during the theft, which lasted 81 minutes. Before leaving, they visited the guards once more, telling them [...] "You’ll <b>be</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> us in about a year," [...] although they were never heard from again. The guards remained handcuffed until police arrived at 8:15a.m. later that morning.|$|E

The album holds a score 79 out of 100 based on 27 critical reviews which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews", {{according to the}} music review aggregator Metacritic. The Observers Rosie Swash stated that Allen's [...] "uniquely acidic brand of pop" [...] music justified the publicity it generated and that [...] "the {{icing on the cake}} is that brutally barbed tongue". Ron Webb wrote for Drowned in Sound that the album [...] "is almost a brilliant record, easily a good one and one that promises to divide opinion like Marmite". In a review for The Guardian, Sophie Heawood stated that [...] "the album is rough round the edges, that amateurism serves to bring the listener in", noting that it gave the album a more personal touch. The NMEs Priya Elan remarked that [...] "with a personality this size, this isn't the last time you'll <b>be</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> [...] ".|$|E

The scene included an exchange between Bart and Marge that the League felt was hurtful to Catholics. William A.

40|$|During {{the past}} few years, Deaf culture has emerged as an {{important}} philosophy {{that could lead to}} a radical restructuring of Deaf education methods. The purpose of this study was to determine attitudes concerning Deaf culture from teachers of residential based schools for the Deaf who <b>are</b> Deaf and <b>Hearing.</b> Prior to initiating direct contact with the teachers, the superintendents or principals of the selected residential schools were contacted via mail, and their permission secured. In the United States, 279 teachers (69 teachers who are Deaf, 210 teachers who <b>are</b> <b>Hearing)</b> <b>from</b> seven midwest residential based schools for the Deaf and in South Korea 310 teachers (26 teachers who are Deaf, 284 teachers who <b>are</b> <b>Hearing)</b> <b>from</b> all eleven residential based schools for the Deaf participated. Two-factor ANOVA procedures with repeated measures on one factor were utilized to analyze the teachers' attitudes toward Deaf culture in America and South Korea from a 30 -question survey using a five-point Likert scale. This study concluded that: (a) Deaf culture was a subculture in mainstream society whether it was a multi- or singular cultural society [...] although attitudes toward Deaf culture were accepted more negatively in a singular society than those in a multi-cultural society; (b) Deaf culture was accepted by teachers of schools for the Deaf who are Deaf more readily than those who <b>are</b> <b>Hearing</b> in both multi- or singular cultural societies; and (c) there was no significant correlation between attitudes of teachers who were employed at different levels of instruction, such as elementary and middle or secondary school.
