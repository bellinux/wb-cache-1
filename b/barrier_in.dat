5|$|Walter Dix (born January 31, 1986) is an American {{sprinter}} {{who specializes}} in the 100 meters and 200 meters. He is the fourth-fastest 200-meter runner ever with a best of 19.53seconds, and has broken the 10-second <b>barrier</b> <b>in</b> the 100 meters, with a best of 9.88seconds.|$|E
5|$|After their {{trips to}} the Himalaya, the Workmans gave lectures about their travels. They were invited to learned societies; Fanny Workman became the first American woman to lecture at the Sorbonne and the second {{to speak at the}} Royal Geographical Society. She {{received}} many medals of honor from European climbing and geographical societies and was {{recognized as one of the}} foremost climbers of her day. She demonstrated that a woman could climb in high altitudes just as well as a man and helped break down the gender <b>barrier</b> <b>in</b> mountaineering.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal {{factors are}} capable of {{altering}} the mucosal <b>barrier.</b> <b>In</b> one study, {{a small group of}} females with apthous stomatitis had fewer occurrences of aphthous ulcers during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or with use of the contraceptive pill. This phase is associated with a fall in progestogen levels, mucosal proliferation and keratinization. This subgroup often experiences remission during pregnancy. However, other studies report no correlation between aphthous stomatitis and menstrual period, pregnancy or menopause.|$|E

40|$|Abstract - The aim of {{the authors}} is to present a review of {{literature}} of Total Productive Maintenance and the <b>barriers</b> <b>in</b> implementation of Total Productive Maintenance TPM. The paper begins with {{a brief description of}} TPM and the <b>barriers</b> <b>in</b> implementation of TPM. Interpretive Structural Modeling ISM and its role <b>in</b> analyzing the <b>barriers</b> <b>in</b> TPM implementation is explained in brief. Applications of ISM in analyzing issues in various fields are highlighted with special emphasis on TPM. The paper moves on to introduction to Structural Equation Modeling SEM and its role in validating ISM <b>in</b> analyzing <b>barriers</b> <b>in</b> implementation of TPM. The paper concludes with a gap analysis from the current literature research that can be carried out and expected outcomes from the proposed research...|$|R

5|$|In 2000, the Second Intifada (also called al-Aqsa Intifada) began, and Israel built a {{separation}} <b>barrier.</b> <b>In</b> the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza, Israel withdrew all settlers and military presence from the Gaza Strip, but maintained military control of numerous {{aspects of the}} territory including its borders, air space and coast. Israel's ongoing military occupation of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem {{continues to be the}} world's longest military occupation in modern times.|$|E
5|$|Several other {{journeys}} {{were completed}} during Scott's absence. Royds and Bernacchi travelled for 31days on the <b>Barrier</b> <b>in</b> a SE direction, observing its uniformly flat character and making further magnetic readings. Another party had explored the Koettlitz Glacier to the south-west, and Wilson had travelled to Cape Crozier {{to observe the}} emperor penguin colony at close quarters.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{is often}} used as an {{insulator}} and chemical <b>barrier</b> <b>in</b> manufacturing integrated circuits, to electrically isolate different structures or as an etch mask in bulk micromachining. As a passivation layer for microchips, it is superior to silicon dioxide, {{as it is a}} significantly better diffusion barrier against water molecules and sodium ions, two major sources of corrosion and instability in microelectronics. It is also used as a dielectric between polysilicon layers in capacitors in analog chips.|$|E
30|$|As seen in Figure 2, the {{potential}} barriers around QDs are strongly asymmetric. The <b>barriers</b> <b>in</b> the QD planes, i.e., {{in the direction}} perpendicular to the current, are substantially smaller than the <b>barriers</b> <b>in</b> {{the direction of the}} current. This asymmetry has strong consequences for the kinetics of photocarriers.|$|R

These were the Navaho Wind Talkers – Native American Marines whose primary job was the transmission of secret tactical messages {{with the use of}} their Native language; the Nisei Soldiers, Japanese American intelligence soldiers during WWII in the Pacific, Africa, Italy and France; the Tuskegee Airmen, the first African-American military aviators; and the Montford Point Marines, the first African-Americans to break the race <b>barrier</b> <b>in</b> the Marines.|$|E
5|$|After losing two {{finals in}} a row to Bellaghy in 1999 and 2000, Ballinderry won the 2001 Derry Championship, once again {{defeating}} Bellaghy in the decider. The club {{went on to win}} the 2001 Ulster Club Championship with victories over St. Gall's in the quarter-final (after a replay), Cavan Gaels in the semi-final and Mayobridge in the final. Muldoon was awarded Ulster Football Award Winner at the AIB GAA Provincial Player Awards 2001 for his role in Ballinderry's march to claim the Ulster Club Championship. He was presented his award by GAA President Seán McCague. Ballinderry went on to represent Ulster in the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship, which they won defeating Tír Chonaill Gaels (London) in the quarter-final, Rathnew (Wicklow) in the semi-final and Nemo Rangers (Cork) in the final. Muldoon played through the pain <b>barrier</b> <b>in</b> the Championship, delaying an operation on a troublesome hip injury until after the All-Ireland final.|$|E
5|$|C.mutica {{populations in}} Europe were first {{found in the}} Netherlands in 1995. During a species inventory, several {{specimens}} of an unknown caprellid were recovered by Platvoet et al. from artificial structures {{in and around the}} Neeltje-Jans and the Eastern Scheldt storm surge <b>barrier</b> <b>in</b> Burghsluis, Zeeland. As with the case of the first discovery of C.mutica in North America, Platvoet et al. initially misidentified them as a new species. Remarking upon the resemblance of the caprellids to C.acanthogaster, they named it Caprella macho. They were later discovered to be introduced populations of C.mutica rather than a new species.|$|E

5|$|Chambers transitioned {{into the}} senior ranks soon after, taking the 100m silver medal behind his British {{teammate}} Darren Campbell at the 1998 European Championships. He achieved a new personal best in September at the 1998 IAAF World Cup with {{a run of}} 10.03s for third place and won a relay gold medal. At the 1998 Commonwealth Games he was a 100m semi finalist and set a games record {{as part of the}} 4×100m relay team. His ability attracted the attention of former sprinter and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Mike McFarlane, who became his coach. He came first in the 100m in the 1999 European Cup, then at a meet in Nuremberg he became only the second European sprinter (after Linford Christie) to break the ten second barrier with a time of 9.99s. Fellow British sprinter Jason Gardener scored a time of 9.98s in Lausanne soon after, becoming the third Briton to break the <b>barrier.</b> <b>In</b> spite of this, Chambers remained some distance behind his North American counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} {{diffusers}} and pumps paled into insignificance besides {{those with the}} porous <b>barrier.</b> <b>In</b> order to work, the gaseous diffusion process required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to plugging. It had to be extremely porous, but strong enough to handle the high pressures. And, like everything else, it had to resist corrosion from uranium hexafluoride. The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the Bell Telephone Laboratories experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the City College of New York worked on a design with electroplated metallic nickel. Norris was an English interior decorator, who had developed a very fine metal mesh for use with a spray gun. Their design appeared too brittle and fragile for the proposed use, particularly on the higher stages of enrichment, but there was hope {{that this could be}} overcome.|$|E
5|$|In July 1947—three {{months after}} Jackie Robinson made {{history with the}} Brooklyn Dodgers—Doby broke the MLB color <b>barrier</b> <b>in</b> the American League when he signed a {{contract}} to play with Bill Veeck's Cleveland Indians. Doby was {{the first player to}} go directly to the majors from the Negro leagues. A seven-time All-Star center fielder, Doby and teammate Satchel Paige were the first African-American players to win a World Series championship when the Indians took the crown in 1948. He helped the Indians win a franchise-record 111 games and the AL pennant in 1954, finished second in the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) award voting and was the AL's RBI leader and home run champion. He went on to play for the Chicago White Sox, Detroit Tigers, and Chunichi Dragons before his retirement as a player in 1962.|$|E

5|$|In early February Amundsen began organising the depot-laying {{journeys}} {{across the}} <b>Barrier,</b> <b>in</b> {{preparation for the}} following summer's assault on the pole. Supply depots laid in advance at regular intervals on the projected route would {{limit the amount of}} food and fuel that the South Pole party would have to carry. The depot journeys would be the first true tests of equipment, dogs and men. For the first journey, to begin on 10February, Amundsen chose Prestrud, Helmer Hanssen and Johansen to accompany him; 18dogs would pull three sledges. Before leaving, Amundsen left instructions with Nilsen regarding Fram. The ship was to sail to Buenos Aires for reprovisioning, before undertaking a programme of oceanographic work in the Southern Ocean and then returning to the Barrier as early as possible in 1912.|$|E
5|$|Sergio Pérez was demoted to seventh {{with the}} {{application}} of a gearbox penalty, following a change made necessary after he hit the <b>barrier</b> <b>in</b> turn 15 during the last practice session. This promoted Ricciardo, Vettel, Räikkönen, Massa, and Kvyat up the grid in the process. Sainz and Magnussen were also demoted, with Magnussen having to start from the pit lane. Lewis Hamilton was given permission to change his front left tyre ahead of the race. Under the regulations, a driver who qualifies in the top ten must start the race on the set of tyres they used to record their best time {{in the second part of}} qualifying. However, Hamilton's front left tyre, which belonged to the set of tyres that he subsequently used to set his fastest time during his next flying lap, was deemed to be too damaged following his lock-up going into turn seven, necessitating its change on safety grounds.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 {{off-season}} {{began with}} a trade for Alex Tanguay, formerly of the Colorado Avalanche, and with Sutter relinquishing his head coaching position to assistant Jim Playfair so he could focus on his duties as general manager. Despite a marked improvement in team offence and a solid 96-point season, it was only good enough for eighth place in a Western Conference where seven teams cracked the 100-point <b>barrier.</b> <b>In</b> the playoffs, Calgary fell in six games to the top seeded Red Wings in the first round. During the series, the Flames were fined by the NHL for several stick-related penalties in the fifth game. Notably, backup goaltender Jamie McLennan was suspended five games for slashing Red Wings forward Johan Franzen. Franzen would score the series clinching goal in the Game 6 defeat in Double Overtime.|$|E

5|$|The Thruway {{continues}} north {{through the}} river valley toward Harriman, where it encounters the Woodbury toll barrier, the southeastern {{end of the}} mainline's major closed ticket system. The barrier {{is located on the}} mainline within exit16 (NY17), a trumpet interchange. Along with the mainline <b>barrier</b> <b>in</b> Harriman, a separate toll plaza exists on the exit16 ramp midway between the Thruway and NY17 exit131 (NY32). Now a completely tolled highway, the Thruway heads northward, roughly paralleling the Hudson River to the river's west as it serves the city of Newburgh, the village of New Paltz, and the city of Kingston, indirectly connecting to the short I-587 in the latter.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack of}} myelin starts {{inflammatory}} processes, which triggers other immune cells {{and the release}} of soluble factors like cytokines and antibodies. Further breakdown of the blood–brain <b>barrier</b> <b>in</b> turn causes a number of other damaging effects such as swelling, activation of macrophages, and more activation of cytokines and other destructive proteins. Inflammation can potentially reduce transmission of information between neurons in at least three ways. The soluble factors released might stop neurotransmission by intact neurons. These factors could lead to or enhance the loss of myelin, or they may cause the axon to break down completely.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} {{restarted}} on lap 26, {{and on the}} approach to the hairpin later in the lap Robert Kubica hit the back of Jarno Trulli's Toyota. The impact forced Kubica onto the grass {{at the edge of}} the track, where a bump launched his car into and along the concrete wall just before the hairpin. After losing three wheels, the nose and suffering major damage to the sidepods in the initial impact, the BMW flipped back across the track and came to rest against the <b>barrier</b> <b>in</b> the run-off area on the other side of the track. Although initial reports said that he had broken his leg, Kubica only suffered a sprained ankle and concussion. The safety car was deployed again after this crash. The safety car was also deployed on lap 50, due to debris from a crash involving Christijan Albers on the previous lap, and on lap 55 due to Vitantonio Liuzzi crashing into the wall of champions once again.|$|E
