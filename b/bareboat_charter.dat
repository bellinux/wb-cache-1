50|$|The Spot Department is {{designated}} for the executing of vessel chartering, which includesvoyage charters, time <b>charters,</b> and <b>bareboat</b> <b>charters.</b> A voyage charter consigns a vessel to aspecified transport of commodities between ports or regions. Time and <b>bareboat</b> <b>charters,</b> onthe other hand, dedicate a vessel’s employment {{for a period}} of time for unspecified trading. Abareboat charter, unlike a time charter, implies that no crew or provisions will be included as partof the agreement.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of charter: bareboat and crewed. <b>Bareboat</b> <b>charters</b> involve a person renting a boat or cabin and skippering it {{themselves}} if they are renting the whole yacht. The other way is gathering up a group and renting the yacht with them. Most bareboat companies also offer courses to teach basic seamanship and prepare people for <b>bareboat</b> <b>chartering.</b> These companies also sometimes provide skippered charters, meaning that boat comes with a skipper but no additional crew.|$|R

Cammell Laird completed the three vessels, with Hudson Cavalier launching on 24 July 1975, and after sea trials were completed, all three were laid up in port while the shipbuilder sought to charter or sell them. On 27 October 1978, the Ministry of Defence expressed interest in chartering two of the tankers, and after conversion for use as an underway replenishment vessel, Hudson Cavalier entered service with the RFA on 8 June 1979 as RFA Appleleaf.

500|$|The act {{of hiring}} a ship to carry cargo is called chartering. [...] Tankers are hired by {{four types of}} charter agreements: the voyage charter, the time charter, the <b>bareboat</b> <b>charter,</b> and {{contract}} of affreightment. In a voyage charter the charterer rents the vessel from the loading port to the discharge port. In a time charter the vessel is hired for a set period of time, to perform voyages as the charterer directs. In a <b>bareboat</b> <b>charter</b> the charterer acts as the ship's operator and manager, taking on responsibilities such as providing the crew and maintaining the vessel. Finally, in a contract of affreightment or COA, the charterer specifies a total volume of cargo to be carried in a specific time period and in specific sizes, for example a COA could be specified as [...] of JP-5 in a year's time in [...] shipments. A completed chartering contract {{is known as a}} charter party.|$|E

2500|$|On 12 May 1998, Charles Upham sailed on a <b>bareboat</b> <b>charter</b> to Spanish company Contenemar SA, {{where she}} was used to {{transport}} oranges and lemons around the Mediterranean. The Alliance Party released their second booklet, The Biggest Lemon Ever to Leave Auckland, in July 1998, which claimed the sealift ship was [...] "doing a passable imitation between a lemon and a white elephant". To counter the claims being made by the Alliance Party and sections of the media, the Audit Office compiled an internal report in September commenting on the allegations, along with other advice received by the government relating to the ship. To serve the public interest, Defence Minister Max Bradford authorised full disclosure of all information the Ministry of Defence and the RNZN could make public, resulting in the November 1998 publication of the document Official Information Pertaining to the Military Sealift Project HMNZS Charles Upham. In July 1999, the Cabinet gave approval in principle for the conversion to occur.|$|E
