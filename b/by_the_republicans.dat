5|$|When the war ended, the state's Democrats {{were upset}} about their wartime {{treatment}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> but they staged a quick comeback. Indiana {{became the first}} state after the Civil War to elect a Democratic governor, Thomas Hendricks. His rise to the governor's office initiated a period of Democratic control in the state that reversed many of the political gains made by the Republican Party during the war.|$|E
5|$|During Roosevelt's fifteen months {{beyond the}} Atlantic, from March 1909 to June 1910, neither man wrote {{much to the}} other. Taft biographer Lurie {{suggested}} that each expected the other {{to make the first}} move to re-establish their relationship on a new footing. Upon Roosevelt's triumphant return, Taft invited him to stay at the White House. The former president declined, and in private letters to friends expressed dissatisfaction at Taft's performance. Nevertheless, he wrote that he expected Taft to be renominated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> in 1912, and did not speak of himself as a candidate.|$|E
5|$|She, {{along with}} the {{remaining}} members of the Imperial Family, was sent into exile after a coup d'état staged by a clique of army officers in 1889. Being cast from her beloved adopted land had a devastating effect on Teresa Cristina's spirit and health. Grieving and ill, she died of respiratory failure leading to cardiac arrest {{little more than a}} month after the monarchy's collapse. She was greatly loved by her subjects, both during her lifetime and afterwards. She was even respected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> who overthrew the Empire. Despite having had no direct impact on Brazil's political history, Teresa Cristina is well regarded by historians not only for her character and irreproachable behavior, but also for her sponsorship of Brazilian culture.|$|E

50|$|Later, {{there was}} a {{reorganization}} attempt in northern Italy, {{with the opening of}} a PAI school at Busto Arsizio in the autumn of 1943. However, the troops were absorbed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Police Force of the Italian Social Republic, and finally <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> National Guard.|$|R
5|$|Incumbent President Rutherford B. Hayes did {{not seek}} re-election, keeping a promise made during the 1876 campaign. After the longest {{convention}} in the party's history, the divided Republicans chose another Ohioan, Representative James A. Garfield, as their standard-bearer. The Democratic Party chose General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania as their nominee. The dominance {{of the two major}} parties began to fray as an upstart left-wing party, the Greenback Party, nominated another Civil War general for president, Iowa Congressman James B. Weaver. In a campaign fought mainly over issues of Civil War loyalties, tariffs, and Chinese immigration, Garfield and Hancock each took just over 48 percent of the popular vote. Weaver and two other minor candidates, Neal Dow and John W. Phelps, together made up the remaining percentage. The election of 1880 was the sixth consecutive presidential election won <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> the second longest winning streak in American history after the Democratic-Republican Party during the period 1800–1824.|$|E
5|$|Al-Badr {{had formed}} two royalist armies— one under his uncle Prince Hassan {{in the east}} and one under his own control in the west. Both armies {{controlled}} most of the north and east of Yemen, including the towns of Harib and Marib. The provincial capital of Northern Yemen, Sadah, which would have given the Imam a key strategic road towards the main capital San'a, was controlled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>republicans.</b> There were also areas like the town of Hajjah, where the royalists controlled the mountains while the Egyptians and republicans controlled the town and fortress. Mercenaries from France, Belgium and England, who had fought in Rhodesia, Malaya, Indochina and Algeria, were sent to assist the Imam in planning, training and giving the irregular forces the ability to communicate with one another and the Saudis. They trained tribesmen in the use of antitank weapons, such as the 106mm gun and in mining techniques. The numbers of mercenaries are estimated in the hundreds, although Egyptian sources at the time reported 15,000. Royalist tactics were confined to guerilla warfare, isolating conventional Egyptian and republican forces, and conducting attacks on supply lines.|$|E

25|$|The war became {{notable for}} {{the passion and}} {{political}} division it inspired and for the many atrocities that occurred. Organized purges occurred in territory captured by Franco's forces so they could consolidate their future regime. A significant number of killings took place in areas controlled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> The extent to which Republican authorities took part in killings in Republican territory varied.|$|E

25|$|A {{surge of}} {{national}} unity in 1861 brought thousands flocking to the colors from every town and city. However, as the war became a crusade to end slavery, many Democrats (especially Irish Catholics) pulled back. The Democrats took a pro-slavery position and included many Copperheads willing to let the South secede. The intensely fought 1863 election for governor was narrowly won <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Democrats {{left the}} General Assembly en masse {{to set up}} a rival {{legislature}} at Carolina Hall, complete with representatives who had been excluded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> In control of the government and backed by the support of federal troops, the Republicans discarded the election returns from Edgefield and Laurens counties for the gubernatorial race and declared Chamberlain elected for a second term on December 5.|$|E

25|$|After {{the failure}} to capture Madrid and the Republican counter attack at the Battle of the Corunna Road, the Nationalists sought to regain the initiative. A 25 mile wide strip of land in {{southern}} Spain along the Mediterranean Sea centering on Málaga, a base of the Spanish Republican Navy, was held <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{and the arrival of}} Italian troops at the nearby port of Cádiz made an attack on Málaga logical.|$|E
25|$|The Republicans also imposed tariffs {{designed}} to protect the infant industries that had been created when Britain was blockading the U.S. With the collapse of the Federalists as a party, the adoption of many Federalist principles <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> and the systematic policy of President James Monroe in his two terms (1817–25) to downplay partisanship, the nation entered an Era of Good Feelings, with far less partisanship than before (or after), and closed out the First Party System.|$|E
25|$|But, most blacks {{remained}} steadfastly {{loyal to}} the Republican Party. After {{the end of the}} Civil War, many whites had conducted a decade-long insurgency to maintain white supremacy and suppress black political power. Black citizens, however, constituted a sizable majority of the electorate, particularly in the Low Country and with narrow majorities in several Piedmont counties. The state Democratic Party was unorganized, not having contested a state election since 1868, when it was utterly defeated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b>|$|E

25|$|An Anti-Treaty IRA column under Tom McEllistrim and John Joe Sheehy {{attacks the}} National Army barracks, {{containing}} 60 troops, in Castlemaine, County Kerry. They use an improvised mortar, one of whose rounds makes {{a direct hit}} on the barracks. In a subsequent two hour gun battle, one Free State soldier is killed, the town's railway station is burned and the bridge over the river Maine blown up <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> The National Army reports 4 Anti-Treaty fighters killed.|$|E
25|$|Many radical Northerners withdrew {{their support}} for land reform in the years {{following}} the war. One reason for the shift in political opinion was fear <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> that land ownership might lead Blacks to align with Democrats for economic reasons. In general, politicians turned their focus to the legal status of freedpeople. In the analysis of W. E. B. Du Bois, black suffrage became more politically palatable precisely as an inexpensive alternative to well-funded agrarian reform.|$|E
