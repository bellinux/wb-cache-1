The highest concentration is in <b>Bucharest-Ilfov</b> area (nearly 8,000 atheists) and generally wealthy areas of the country (Transylvania, Banat), the lowest - in Oltenia (750), Dobruja and poor areas of Wallachia (Teleorman, Călărași, Ialomița). Before the census of October 2011, Secular Humanist Association (ASUR) conducted a campaign through which tried to promote an accurate census, in which people who consider themselves atheists to have confidence in selecting this option. According to ASUR, European Values Survey (1999) and World Values Survey (2005) polls show that the real percentage of those who declare themselves atheists is at least 6-7% of the population, 60-70 times more than the result of census in 2002.

40|$|Competitive economies {{display a}} pattern of {{regional}} clusters and networks, where innovation is stimulated by intensive interaction among industries and where knowledge intensive services {{play an important role}} in novelty creation and diffusion. In order to catch up with the most competitive regions, the region of <b>Bucharest-Ilfov</b> needs to develop a service-inclusive innovation system, which in turn requires an adequate policy mix. The main aim of this paper is to provide an assessment of the service innovation system in the <b>Bucharest-Ilfov</b> region, by confronting its current performance with the regional innovation policy context. On one hand, we characterize the performance of the service innovation system in accordance with the methodology and the data provided by the European Service Innovation Scoreboard. On the other hand, using desk research and in-depth interviews with experts, we investigate the service innovation policy mix on conceptual grounds provided by the literature regarding the typology of service innovation policy approaches. We find that the policy measures supporting innovation that are available in the <b>Bucharest-Ilfov</b> region are not specifically targeted to regional development priorities and are predominantly technology oriented. Policies are not systemic and ignore the potential of knowledge intensive business services to be a driver for innovation in the region. This paper highlights the stakes of adopting a coherent regional innovation policy, designed systemically, and exploiting the full potential of knowledge-based services. Being aware of the current state of service innovation within the region and its potential, the stakeholders may benefit of the recommendations included within the paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{labour market}} is {{strongly}} segmented, being normally {{characterized by the}} coexistence of two forms of deficits: the labour demand deficit (i. e. unemployment) and the labour offer deficit (i. e. vacancy jobs). As these deficits are obvious {{in the case of}} some different occupations or of some different regions, then they will have a weak compensation. Between 2005 - 2008 these deficits are increasing at Romanian regions level. The most important of them are in Public administration, and Education. On regions the most importants deficits are in <b>Bucharest-Ilfov</b> (the richest) and North-East (the poorest). On Occupation group the biggest deficits is for specialists with intellectual and scientific occupations. There is also a trend of increasing for labour market defficits on regional level. The most important regonal deficits are in: North-East, West and <b>Bucharest-Ilfov.</b> On regions the most important deficits are for Farmers and skilled workers in agriculture, forestry and fishery in <b>Bucharest-Ilfov</b> (gravitational effect) and South-West: specialists with intellectual and scientific occupations: West,and Bucharest-Ilfov; workers for maintenance and adjustment: North-East. There is a negative relation between the two deficits, so that the rate of unemployment tends to get decreased below the level of the natural unemployment and the rate of the vacancy will get increased during the periods when a strong economic growth is recorded; the inverse relation has been represented within the "Beveridge curve".

Having in mind this complex context, in this paper, we present a personal point of view regarding the potential for growth in tourism of <b>Bucharest-Ilfov</b> region, due to vast range of tourist offer (cultural, business, recreational). The <b>Bucharest-Ilfov</b> region has a great tourism potential: the attraction capacity of the Bucharest urban centre is enriched by the environmental and cultural value of the areas and sites surrounding the capital city. This combination of urban, business, cultural and environmental resources is a powerful basis for developing the tourism sector in the region. The tourism sector must be a priority of the regional development policy, because {{of the importance of the}} tourism contribution to growth and job creation so the infrastructure improvement is therefore a necessity for tourism development.

30|$|The {{background}} {{variables are}} associated with the above relationships, which confirm the importance of considering them as control factors, as did Billari et al. (2009) and Dommermuth et al. (2011). Among them, the relevance of the regions in explaining fertility-decision making is limited but not negligible. Compared with the <b>Bucharest-Ilfov</b> region, living in the North-East region increases the likelihood of planning a second child. This result is {{explained by the fact that}} these two regions have different cultural and socio-demographic characteristics; for example, the average cultural modernity in <b>Bucharest-Ilfov,</b> the capital region, is the highest across country, whereas the North-East region belongs to the rather traditionalist value system, where individuals value families with more than one child. Demographic indicators underline that in the North-East, women have the highest parities and become mothers earliest compared with other regions. At the same time, <b>Bucharest-Ilfov</b> region has the lowest rates of transitions to a second birth (Mureșan et al. 2008). Having more or less children might be related to individuals’ social identity which is produced differently in these two specific regions via social interactions and shared meaning of what a ‘proper’ family size should be. Moreover, given that among the development regions in Romania, the North-East is the one with the highest poverty risk, it may be that intending to have a second child reflects the lack of opportunities to invest in longer education or careers and individuals are socialised or pressed to have larger families. Further research is needed to understand the reasons why people in North-East plan and have more than one child and what could be the possible implications of these large families on both the children’s educational outcomes and parents’ economic situation. Bucharest, on the other hand, as the city capital, has a higher GDP per capita than the national average, with an economic structure based on services and a population twice as educated and wealthy (Voicu 2008). Individuals living in this region might display modern family formation patterns, either postponing the second child or adjusting their family size to just one child. No other significant regional differences in fertility intentions have been found.|$|E

Conventionally, BMA imbeds the entire Ilfov county (which surrounds it and form together the <b>Bucharest-Ilfov</b> region (NUTS 2)) as well as localities from other four counties of the South - Muntenia region (also NUTS 2). As <b>Bucharest-Ilfov</b> region appears as an enclave within South-Muntenia region, in a broader view it is considered that BMA influences all seven surrounding counties belonging to the South-Muntenia region. This region as a whole (apart from the localities of the four counties {{that are to be}} incorporated in the metropolitan area) plus Bucharest MA are viewed as the Bucharest metropolitan region, in other words the South-Muntenia region is the BMA external hinterland. In technical terms, the metropolitan area is a zone of direct city impact in which the relationships are strong and permanent (functional urban area, internal hinterland zone) whereas the metropolitan region is a zone in which the relationships are weaker, but the area is under the core city influence (macroregion, external hinterland zone). One of the main debates around BMA and metropolitan region refers to the effects of the BMA on its external hinterland, South-Muntenia region, by far less developed: are they / will they be spread or rather backwash effects?

30|$|Romania is characterised {{by large}} {{territorial}} differences. Namely, in 1998, eight development regions were identified, 2 formed {{by a group}} of counties in the territorial contiguity. These regions are very different as far as GDP per capita, education, life expectancy and values are concerned. For example, the values and lifestyle of the North-East region differ from those of the other development regions such as the Centre, West and North-West regions. The mean age of mothers at first birth is lowest in the North-East and South-West regions (Mureșan et al. 2008). Several explanations for the regional differences have been posited. The first explanation is historical (Sandu 2011 b): the domination of different empires in the Romanian history left cultural differences within the country (driven by influences of the Ottoman Empire for the South regions; the Austro-Hungarian Empire for the North-West, West and Centre; and the Russian Empire for the North-East and part of the South-East). 3 The second explanation is economic and relates to the collapse of the Soviet industry, which triggered high dismissals of the workforce that were unable to reintegrate into any other fields of employment. The unemployment rate increased from 3.4 % in 1990 to 7.1 % in 2005 (International Monetary Fund 2015). However, while the decreasing trend in the number of employees has continued in most of the regions, this number has increased in the capital region, <b>Bucharest-Ilfov.</b> This area has also benefited in the highest degree from national and foreign investments (Lefter and Constantin 2009). Consequently, the <b>Bucharest-Ilfov</b> area is the most affluent, where the lifestyle is penetrated by more modern values. Sociologists and anthropologists studying space have put forth theories that spaces are not containers for society, or things by themselves, but are complex social constructions based on values and meanings individuals ascribe. Social relations and social identities are produced in a space where are becoming inscribed. In turn, a space reproduces and returns social relations and identities (Lefebvre 1991; Karlsson 2003; Kearney 2004). Therefore, the eight Romanian development regions are seen as socio-cultural matrices, each one standing for a mental pattern with physical boundaries and well-configured social identities, which influence individual expectations and behaviours (Sandu 2011 a).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{sustained}} {{economic growth}} in 2000 - 2008 in Romania was accompanied by an oscillating employment rate between 58 - 59 % {{in the same period}} and by improvement of the overall labor productivity.
