40|$|Stem {{cell-based}} cell replacement therapies {{aiming at}} restoring injured or diseased brain function ultimately {{rely on the}} capability of transplanted cells to promote functional recovery. The mechanisms by which stem cell-based therapies for neurological conditions can lead to functional recovery are uncertain, but structural and functional repair appears to depend on integration of transplanted cell-derived neurons into neuronal circuitries. The nature by which stem/progenitor cell-derived neurons synaptically integrate into neuronal circuitries is largely unexplored. Here we show that transplanted GFP-labeled neuronal progenitor cells into the rat hippocampus exhibit mature neuronal morphology following 4 - 10 weeks. GFP-positive cells were preferentially integrated into the principal cell layers of hippocampus, particularly CA 3. Patch-clamp recordings from GFP-expressing cells revealed that they generated fast action potentials, and their intrinsic membrane properties were overall similar to endogenous host neurons recorded in same areas. As judged <b>by</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>spontaneous</b> excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), transplanted GFP-positive cells were synaptically integrated into the host circuitry. Comparable to host neurons, both paired-pulse depression and facilitation of afferent fiber stimulation-evoked EPSCs were observed in GFP-positive cells. Upon high-frequency stimulation, GFP-positive cells displayed post-tetanic potentiation of EPSCs, in some cases followed by long-term potentiation (LTP) lasting for more than 30 min. Our data show {{for the first time}} that transplanted neuronal progenitor cells can become functional neurons and their afferent synapses are capable of expressing activity-dependent short and long-term plasticity. These synaptic properties may facilitate host-to-graft interactions and regulate activity of the grafted cells promoting functional recovery of the diseased brain...|$|E

40|$|Epilepsy is {{the third}} most common brain {{disorder}} and affects millions of people. Epilepsy is characterized <b>by</b> the <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>spontaneous</b> seizures, that is, bursts of synchronous firing of large populations of neurons. These are believed to result from abnormal regulation of neuronal excitability that favors hypersynchrony. Among the intrinsic conductances that govern neuronal excitability, the hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) plays complex and important roles in the fine-tuning of both cellular and network activity. Not surprisingly, dysregulation of I(h) and/or of its conducting ion-channels (HCN) has been strongly implicated in various experimental models of epilepsy, {{as well as in}} human epilepsy. Here we provide an overview of recent findings on the distinct physiological roles played by I(h) in specific contexts, and the cellular mechanisms that underlie these functions, including the subunit make-up of the channels.

The recent identification of arthritis transfer with antibodies to the self-antigen glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerase has boosted this interest. Fc receptor involvement in arthritis has been evaluated, identifying pro-inflammatory and inhibitory Fc gamma receptor subtypes, and demonstrating a link between Fc gamma receptor expression, cytokine production, cartilage destruction, and mouse strain susceptibility to immune complex arthritis. Further proof of a key role of interleukin (IL) - 1 in arthritis was provided <b>by</b> the <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>spontaneous</b> arthritis in IL- 1 receptor antagonist knockout mice and elicitation of full-blown arthritis in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -deficient mice.

IL- 18 neutralization improved arthritis outcome, but its central role in host defense against bacterial infections may complicate therapeutic IL- 18 targeting. T helper 1 (Th 1) cells may aggravate arthritis and joint destruction through the production of IL- 17, which shows joint destructive potential independent of IL- 1. Studies have also focused on the control of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand, modulation with IL- 4, and regulation of downstream mediators in tissue destruction.

Ten adult male rats presenting SRSs were monitored for behavioural events by video system one month before and one month after LP ibotenic acid lesion.

After the surgical procedure, the animals were sacrified and the brains were processed for histological analysis by the Nissl method. The LP group seizure frequency was 3. 1 ± 1. 9 before ibotenic acid injection and showed an increase (16. 3 ± 7. 2 per week) after LP lesion. No changes in SRSs frequency were observed in the AV group after ibotenic lesion in these nuclei.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate and characterize endogenous epileptiform activity in hippocampal–entorhinal cortical (HEC) slices from epileptic animals. This study employed HEC slices isolated from a large series of control and epileptic animals to evaluate and compare the presence, degree and localization of endogenous SREDs using extracellular and whole cell current clamp recordings. Animals were made epileptic using the pilocarpine model of epilepsy. Extracellular field potentials were recorded simultaneously from areas CA 1, CA 3, dentate gyrus, and entorhinal cortex and whole cell current clamp recordings were obtained from CA 3 neurons. All regions from epileptic HEC slices (n= 53) expressed SREDs, with an average frequency of 1. 3 Hz. In contrast, control slices (n= 24) did not manifest any SREDs. Epileptic HEC slices demonstrated slow and fast firing patterns of SREDs. Whole cell current clamp recordings from epileptic HEC slices showed that CA 3 neurons exhibited paroxysmal depolarizing shifts associated with these SREDs. To our knowledge this is the first significant demonstration of endogenous SREDs in a large series of HEC slices from epileptic animals in comparison to controls. Epileptiform discharges were found to propagate around hippocampal circuits.

We used a videomicroscopic technique in single cardiac myocytes to quantify the amplitude of electrically stimulated twitches and to monitor the <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> the mechanical manifestation <b>of</b> <b>spontaneous</b> SR Ca 2 + release, i. e., the spontaneous contractile wave. In rat myocytes exposed to increasing bathing [Ca 2 +] (Cao) from 0. 25 to 10 mM, the Cao at which the peak twitch amplitude occurred in a given cell was not unique but varied with the rate of stimulation or the presence of drugs: in cells stimulated at 0. 2 Hz in the absence of drugs, the maximum twitch amplitude occurred in 2 mM Cao; a brief exposure to 50 nM ryanodine before stimulation at 0. 2 Hz shifted the Cao of the maximum twitch amplitude to 7 mM. In cells stimulated at 1 Hz in the absence of drugs, the maximum twitch amplitude occurred in 4 mM Cao; 1 microM isoproterenol shifted the Cao of the maximum twitch amplitude to 3 mM. Regardless of the drug or the stimulation frequency, the Cao at which the twitch amplitude saturated varied linearly with the Cao at which spontaneous Ca 2 + release first occurred, and this relationship conformed to a line of identity (r = 0. 90, p = less than 0. 001, n = 25). The average peak twitch amplitude did not differ among these groups of cells. In other experiments, (a) the extent of rest potentiation of the twitch amplitude in rat myocytes was also limited <b>by</b> the <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>spontaneous</b> Ca 2 + release, and (b) in both rat and rabbit myocytes continuously stimulated in a given Cao, the twitch amplitude after the addition of ouabain saturated when spontaneous contractile waves first appeared between stimulated twitches.

The effect was obtained for a large set of behaviors (120), each presented for 5 s, and for behaviors that participants did not subsequently recognize or recall. Antonyms of the implied traits were falsely recognized less often than unrelated traits, suggesting that STIs have extended implications. Explicit person–trait judgments predicted both false recognition and response times for implied traits. Social life is replete with opportunities to form impressions of strangers.

40|$|Chronic {{pain and}} {{especially}} neuropathic pain {{are a major}} challenge to clinical practice and basic science. Neuropathic pain syndromes are characterised <b>by</b> the <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>spontaneous</b> ongoing and stimulus-induced pain. Stimulus-induced pain (hyperalgesia and allodynia) may result from sensitisation processes in the peripheral (primary hyperalgesia) or central (secondary hyperalgesia) nervous system. The traditional underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of pain perception says thatpain involves a direct transmission system from somatic receptors to the brain. The amount of pain perceived, moreover, {{is assumed to be}} directly proportional to the extent of injury. The peripheral and central neural networks that mediate nociception show extensive plasticity in pathological disease states. Disease-induced plasticity can occur at both structural and functional levels and is manifest as changes in individual molecules, synapses, cellular function and network activity. Recent research has indicate a better understanding of communication within the neural matrix of physiological pain and has also brought important advances in concepts of injury-induced hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia and how these might contribute to the complex, multidimensional state of chronic pain. Clinical and experimental evidence shows that noxious stimuli may sensitize central neural structures involved in pain perception. Salient clinical examples of these effects include amputees with pains in a phantom limb that are similar or identical to those felt in the limb before it was amputated, and patients after surgery who have benefited from preemptive analgesia which blocks the surgery-induced afferent barrage and/or its central consequences. Sensory stimuli act on neural systems that have been modified by past inputs, and the behavioral output is significantly influenced by the ”memory” of these prior events. An increased understanding of the central changes induced by peripheral injury or noxious stimulation should lead to new and improved clinical treatment for the relief and prevention of pathological pain. However, the cerebral processing of hyperalgesia and allodynia is still controversially discussed. In recent years, neuroimaging methods (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI; magnetoencephalography, MEG; positron emission tomography, PET) have provided new insightsinto the aberrant cerebral processing of neuropathic pain. Thepresent paper reviews different cerebral mechanisms contributing to chronicity processes in neuropathic pain syndromes. These mechanisms include reorganisation of cortical somatotopic maps in sensory or motor areas (highly relevant for phantom limb pain and CRPS), increased activity in primary nociceptive areas, recruitment of new cortical areas usually not activated by nociceptive stimuli and aberrant activity in brain areas normally involved in descending inhibitory pain networks. Moreover, there is evidence from PET studies for changes of excitatory and inhibitory transmitter systems. Finally, advanced methods of structural brain imaging (voxel-based morphometry, VBM) show significant structural changes suggesting that chronic pain syndromes may be associated with neurodegeneration...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{timing of}} action {{potentials}} {{is required for}} neurons in auditory brainstem nuclei to encode the frequency and phase of incoming sound stimuli. Many such neurons express "high threshold" Kv 3 -family channels that are required for firing at high rates (> - 200 Hz). Kv 3 channels are expressed in gradients along the medial-lateral tonotopic axis of the nuclei. Numerical simulations of auditory brainstem neurons were {{used to calculate the}} input-output relations of ensembles of 1 - 50 neurons, stimulated at rates between 100 - 1500 Hz. Individual neurons with different levels of potassium currents differ in their ability to follow specific rates of stimulation but all perform poorly when the stimulus rate is greater than the maximal firing rate of the neurons. The temporal accuracy of the combined synaptic output of an ensemble is, however, enhanced by the presence of gradients in Kv 3 channel levels over that measured when neurons express uniform levels of channels. Surprisingly, at high rates of stimulation, temporal accuracy is also enhanced <b>by</b> the <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> random <b>spontaneous</b> activity, such as is normally observed in the absence of sound stimulation. For any pattern of stimulation, however, greatest accuracy is observed when, in the presence <b>of</b> <b>spontaneous</b> activity, the levels of potassium conductance in all of the neurons is adjusted to that found in the subset of neurons that respond better than their neighbors. This optimization of response by adjusting the K(+) conductance occurs for stimulus patterns containing either single and or multiple frequencies in the phase-locking range. The findings suggest that gradients of channel expression are required for normal auditory processing and that changes in levels of potassium currents across the nuclei, by mechanisms such as protein phosphorylation and rapid changes in channel synthesis, adapt the nuclei to the ongoing auditory environment...|$|R
40|$|Smooth muscle {{responds}} to IP 3 -generating (sarcolemma acting) neurotransmitters and hormones by releasing Ca 2 + from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via IP 3 receptors (IP 3 Rs). This release may propagate as Ca 2 + waves. The Ca 2 + signal emanating from IP 3 generation may be amplified by its activating further Ca 2 + release from ryanodine receptors (RyRs) {{in the process}} of Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release (CICR). Evidence for this proposal has relied largely on the use of blocking drugs such as ryanodine, tetracaine and dantrolene, reportedly specific inhibitors of RyRs. Here we have examined whether or not Ca 2 + released via IP 3 Rs subsequently activates RyRs. In addition, the specificity of the blocking agents has been assessed by determining the extent of their ability to block IP 3 -mediated Ca 2 + release under conditions in which RyRs were not activated. IP 3 -evoked Ca 2 + release and Ca 2 + waves did not require or activate RyRs. However, the RyR blocking drugs inhibited IP 3 -mediated Ca 2 + signals at concentrations thought to be selective for RyRs. In single colonic smooth muscle cells, voltage clamped in the whole cell configuration, carbachol (CCh) evoked propagating Ca 2 + waves which were not inhibited by ryanodine when the sarcolemma potential was − 70 mV. At − 20 mV, at which potential the SR Ca 2 + content was increased and RyRs activated, ryanodine inhibited the Ca 2 + waves. Photolysed caged IP 3 increased [Ca 2 +]c; ryanodine, by itself, did not reduce the IP 3 -evoked [Ca 2 +]c increase when the sarcolemma potential was maintained at − 70 mV. However, after activation of RyRs by caffeine, in the continued presence of ryanodine, the IP 3 -evoked [Ca 2 +]c increase was inhibited. In other experiments, RyRs were activated (as evidenced <b>by</b> the <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>spontaneous</b> transient outward currents) by depolarizing the sarcolemma to − 20 mV and again ryanodine was effective in inhibiting IP 3 -evoked Ca 2 + increase. Thus while ineffective by itself, ryanodine inhibited IP 3 -evoked Ca 2 + increases, presumably by causing persistent opening of the channel and depleting the SR of Ca 2 +, after RyRs were activated. These experiments establish that IP 3 -evoked Ca 2 + release and Ca 2 + waves do not activate RyRs; had they done so ryanodine would have inhibited the Ca 2 + increase. However, under conditions where ryanodine was ineffective against the IP 3 -evoked Ca 2 + transient (i. e. when RyRs were not activated, e. g. at a membrane potential of − 70 mV) tetracaine and dantrolene each blocked IP 3 -evoked Ca 2 + increases. The results show that although IP 3 -mediated Ca 2 + release does not activate RyRs, RyR blockers can inhibit IP 3 -mediated Ca 2 + signals...|$|R

One third of epilepsy patients are resistant to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), therefore the development of novel treatments is required. Glutamate is implicated in epilepsy however, only a few glutamate receptor antagonists have been successful in epilepsy trials. An indirect means of modifying glutamate-mediated excitation, such as targeting nitric oxide (NO), might be a reasonable alternative approach. Selectively targeting NO signalling pathway by two drug interventions was investigated in this thesis. Post-synaptic density 95 blocking peptide (PSD 95 BP) is a protein that uncouples GluN 2 subunits of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor from neuronal NO synthase to prevent downstream neurotoxic signalling of NO. In contrast, 1400 W is a highly specific inducible NO synthase inhibitor that binds to the guanidine recognition site of the enzyme, competing with L-arginine and preventing neurotoxic production of NO. These compounds are effective in animal models of stroke and were tested here in a C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse model of epileptogenesis. Kainic acid (KA) is widely used to induce status epilepticus (SE) in animals and the resulting neuropathology mimics that seen in humans with temporal lobe epilepsy. Repeated low dose administration of KA via intraperitoneal injection every 30 minutes consistently induced generalised seizures but was associated with inter-animal variability in KA sensitivity, acute seizure severity and mortality rate. Extra-dural telemetry electrodes were implanted in mice for electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Two algorithms, measuring spike frequency and EEG coastline respectively, were used to quantify epileptiform activity. Mice that received drug interventions following KA-induced SE had significantly lower mean spike frequency and fewer extended coastline epochs per day than the control group at both 7 and 14 days after the initial insult. Label-free proteomics quantification showed significant changes to the hippocampal protein profile as a result of both PSD 95 BP and 1400 W administration following KA-induced seizures. Drug treatment, singly or in combination, also reversed the effects of KA on the expression of both transforming growth factor β 1 and inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4. 1 in the hippocampus. Surgical implantation of extra-dural electrodes significantly lowered the seizure threshold to KA and was associated with an increase in brain expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that careful consideration is required in studies involving intracranial surgery to assess epileptogenesis or AED effects. Current research investigating novel therapeutic agents is focusing on non-NMDA glutamate receptors, such as α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid and kainate receptors, as potential AED targets. There are no compounds targeting the NO signalling pathway currently being investigated for the treatment of epilepsy. The data reported in this thesis give cause for optimism but further studies are needed to fully investigate the antiepileptic and possible antiepileptogenic properties of PSD 95 BP and 1400 W and true efficacy will ultimately require clinical evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Epilepsy is {{a common}} {{neurological}} disorder marked <b>by</b> the <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>spontaneous</b> seizures caused <b>by</b> abnormal neuronal activity in the brain. About 65 million people worldwide are estimated to have epilepsy. Many epilepsy patients can be treated effectively with currently available anti-epileptic drugs, but for 25 - 30 % of this patient population, adequate seizure control is not achieved. Even if patients can undergo surgery, only 45 - 75 % stays seizure free. For thesereasons, the discovery of novel anticonvulsant lead compounds and the subsequent development of new, effective antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) remains an important area of research. Zebrafish offer several advantages that make them an attractive in vivo model for different diseases. First of all they show a high genetic, physiological and pharmacological similarity to humans. Additionally, the embryos and larvae develop rapidly ex utero and are optical transparent, making detection of morphological and behavioral effects possible. Recently zebrafish have also emerged as in vivo model for epilepsy. For instance, seven-day-old zebrafish larvae exposed to the GABAA antagonist pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) exhibit increased locomotor activity, seizure-like behavior, and epileptiform electrographic activity. A previous study showed that 12 out of 13 AEDs suppressed PTZ-mediated increases in larval movement, indicating the potential utility of zebrafish as a high-throughput in vivo model for AED discovery. However, a question remained as to whether an AED-induced decrease in locomotion is trulyindicative of anticonvulsant activity, as some drugs may impair larval movement through other mechanisms such as general toxicity or sedation. In order to validate further the model, we carried out a study in PTZ-treated zebrafish larvae, to directly compare the ability of AEDs to inhibit seizure-like behavioral manifestations with their capacity to suppress epileptiform electrographic activity. We re-tested the 13 AEDs of which 12 were previously reported to inhibit convulsions in the larval movement tracking assay, administering concentrations that did not, on their own, impair locomotion. In parallel, we carried out open-field recordings on larval brains after treatment with each AED. For 10 out of 13 AEDs we obtained the same response in both the behavioral and electrographic assays. These AEDs are: carbamazepine, diazepam, ethosuximide, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, primidone and sodium valproate. Tiagabine, topiramate and zonisamide gave a different response when the behavioral and electrographic assays were compared. Topiramate and zonisamide were positive in the behavioral assay and negative in the electrographic assay, whereas for tiagabine {{it was the other}} way round. Only diazepam, ethosuximide and sodium valproate tested positive in bothassays. Overall our data correlate well with those reported in the literature for acute rodent PTZ tests, indicating that the larval zebrafish brain is more discriminatory than previously thought in its response to AEDs with different modes of action. Our results underscore the validity of using the zebrafish larval locomotor assay as a rapid first-pass screening tool in assessing the anticonvulsant and/or proconvulsant activity of compounds, but also highlight the importance of performing adequate validation when using in vivo models. Subsequent, this validated behavioral zebrafish method was used in the screening ofmedicinal plants in order to discover possible new AEDs. Medicinal plants are still used in many developing countries in the treatment of various diseases instead of modern medicine. One of the indications is epilepsy. The majority of the patient rely on the treatment given by traditional healers. Many different plants are used for the treatment of epilepsy, dependent on the region. In Eastern Congo a decoction of 14 plants is used by traditional healers for the treatment of patients with seizures. In collaboration with a neurologist of the University of Bukavu, 10 of these plants were identified, collected and extracted for screening in the behavioral zebrafish seizure model. An extract of the leaves of Indigofera arrecta, a large shrub belonging to the family of Fabaceae and locally called Kasholoza, particularly showed potent anticonvulsant activity. Hence, we set out to isolate and identify the secondary bio-active metabolites of the plant. Bioassay-guided fractionation using zebrafish as an in vivo model for epilepsy and structural using high-resolution mass spectrometry and NMR resulted in the isolation of indirubin. Purified indirubin was used for further testing, showing a positive effect in the behavioral and in the electrographic assay in zebrafish. Indirubin also showed antiepileptic activity in rodent models, in the 6 Hz model in mice and in the i ntrahippocampal pilocarpine limbic seizure model in rats. Testing a number of compounds with different affinities for the primary targets (GSK- 3 ß, CDK andAhR) of indirubin in the zebrafish behavior assay showed us that the anticonvulsant activity of indirubin was probably due to GSK- 3 ß inhibition. Therefore, two other selective GSK- 3 ß inhibitiors were chosen for testing in a panel of zebrafish and rodent seizure models. BIO-acetoxime, a potent indirubin-like GSK- 3 alfa/ß inhibitor, and TCS 2002, a potent non-indirubin related GSK- 3 ß inhibitor, also proved to have anticonvulsant activity in almost the same set of experiments as indirubin. Only TCS 2002 gave a different result in the electrographic zebrafish assay. In addition, targeted inhibition of GSK- 3 ß using antisense-mediated morpholino knockdown wasable to counter PTZ-induced seizure behavior in a concentration dependentmanner in zebrafish. Based on this study indirubin, BIO-acetoxime and TCS 2002 may be possible new AEDs with a new mechanism of action. Our results strongly point to GSK- 3 ß inhibition as being responsible for the antiepileptic effect. Therefore, GSK- 3 ß inhibitors may represent a potential new class of AEDs with a novel mechanism of action. nrpages: 125 status: publishe...|$|R
