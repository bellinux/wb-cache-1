30|$|Mine {{reclamation}} {{bonds are}} used in countries with mineral mining to ensure that reclamation of the mined area is completed. The United States, Canada, and Australia are countries with established mine reclamation bond programs, with the United States coal system having been in place since 1977. China implemented a bonding system in 1998 and by 2013 all 31 provinces had established a system. An effective bonding system must be conditioned on fair and enforceable nationwide reclamation standard, stimulate companies to conduct reclamation by forming economic incentives rather than penalties that become a liability, and allow for full public participation. Based on these principles, this paper compares seven important factors for a successful reclamation bonding system: laws and regulations, administrative authority, bond types, bond size, calculation method, bond release, and public participation. The results show variation in policies and procedures for bonding among countries. Using principles and policies primarily from the United States, China should establish a national reclamation bonding system with legislation that forms a national authority to oversee and enforce reclamation standards and bond requirements. In addition, China can expand bond financial types and strategies, set the size of reclamation bonds {{at the level of}} a third-party reclamation cost, and set unified standards for calculation. Phased bond release should be established with specific reclamation criteria for each phase of release. Finally, <b>bonding</b> <b>regulations</b> should clearly identify opportunities for full public participation in the process.|$|E

To improve the robustness of the findings, we use two distinct methodologies. These include traditional mean-variance analysis from modern portfolio theory, and Monte Carlo simulations that estimate the distribution of wealth accumulated at retirement from the contributions of a hypothetical worker. Both methods produce qualitatively and quantitatively similar results: workers with risk aversion varying from aggressive to conservative will be better served by allowing international diversification. The results are particularly persuasive for the second approach. The EPF fund managers will likely behave fairly conservatively toward risk, which suggests that around half of the fund assets should be invested abroad.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{economics}} of secondary markets for government bonds. Ultimately, the analysis is shaped by a public policy goal: assessing {{the elements of a}} regulatory framework for these markets. In that regard, the decisive role of market structure leads to a critical review of microstructure conclusions relevant specifically for government debt markets. It is argued that the nature of information asymmetries and matching costs in government debt markets determines a bias towards a fragmented microstructure at odds both with exchange-like arrangements and with ordinary regulatory approaches. Hence, a generic conclusion highlights the risks of blindly transposing regulatory principles from the equity markets area without due regard to the specifics of the bond market. As a specific application of this idea, the paper critically reviews electronic trading platforms that emulate exchange-like order execution solutions. More specifically, the paper opposes the hybrid microstructure (pure limit order book plus affirmative quoting obligation) faced by European primary dealers and the arbitrage-based approach to market-making found in US inter-dealer markets. The Citigroup disruptive trade in August 2004 is analyzed from this perspective. Government <b>bond</b> <b>regulation</b> is argued to necessarily depart from ordinary approaches also because it captures the diverse interests of various governmental agencies. As an application of this principle, the paper discusses repo and short-selling <b>regulation</b> in government <b>bond</b> markets. The atypical market structure and the multi- agency endeavour around government bond markets raise the chances of regulatory failures. Nevertheless, it is argued that a reliance on competition, integrative infrastructure and basic systemic protections as over-arching principles for regulation is consistent with recommendations from relevant economic theory. Finally, political economy issues arising in implementation of transparency, disclosure or retail investor protection will be addressed in the context of selected country cases. government <b>bonds,</b> microstructure, <b>regulation...</b>|$|R

The initial announcement that the Administration supported tighter regulation of banks led to a generalized fall in advanced economy bank shares compared to local equity markets. For later Dodd-Frank announcements, however, falls in U. S. bank equity prices were accompanied by increases in U. K. and Swiss valuations, implying a potential for regulatory arbitrage. Turning to macro policies, the 2008 / 9 fiscal and monetary stimulus packages generally supported foreign activity, while the impact of similar stimulus in 2010 is less clear.

40|$|SAR endolysins are a {{recently}} discovered class of muralytic enzymes that are regulated by dynamic membrane topology. They are synthesized as enzymatically inactive integral membrane proteins during the phage infection cycle and then are activated by conformational remodeling upon {{release from the}} membrane. This topological duality depends on N-terminal SAR (Signal-Anchor-Release) domains, which are enriched in weakly hydrophobic residues and require the proton motive force to be maintained in the bilayer. The first SAR endolysin to be characterized was P 1 Lyz, of phage P 1. Its activation requires a disulfide bond isomerization involving its catalytic Cys initiated by a free cysteine thiol from the newly-liberated SAR domain. A second mode of disulfide <b>bond</b> <b>regulation,</b> as typified by Lyz 103 of the Erwinia Amylovora phage ERA 103, has been demonstrated. In its membrane bound form, Lyz 103 is inactivated by a disulfide that is formed between cysteine residues flanking a catalytic glutamate. A second class of SAR endolysins, typified by R 21, the lysozyme of the lambdoid phage 21, does not require disulfide bond isomerization for activation. Rather, these proteins are dependent on {{the release of the}} SAR domain for proper folding of the catalytic cleft. Bioinformatic analysis indicates that the regulatory theme of R 21 is common in the SAR endolysins of dsDNA phages. Furthermore, bioinformatic study of endolysins of dsDNA phage of Gram-negative hosts revealed two new classes of SAR endolysins that are not homologous to T 4 gpe, as all SAR endolysins were once thought to be. SAR endolysins were found in nearly 25 % of sequenced dsDNA phages of Gram- negative hosts including 933 W, which is involved in the release of Shiga toxin from EHEC strain EDL 933. An inhibitor study against the SAR endolysin of 933 W, R 933 W, was performed using a custom compound library in a high through-put, in vivo lysis assay. Of nearly 8, 000 compounds screened, one compound, designated 67 -J 8, inhibited lysis but not growth. In vivo and in vitro experiments show that the compound has no effect on R 933 W activity, accumulation, or secretion. In vivo experiments suggest that 67 -J 8 increases the proton motive force, thereby presumably retaining the SAR domain in the membrane...|$|R

Proposals to regulate credit rating agencies focus on micro-prudential issues and aim at reducing conflicts of interest and increasing transparency and competition. In contrast, this paper argues that macro-prudential regulation is necessary to address the systemic risk inherent to ratings. The paper illustrates how financial markets have increasingly relied on ratings. It shows how downgrades have led to systemic market losses and increased illiquidity. The paper suggests the use of "ratings maps" and stress-tests to assess the systemic risk of ratings, and increased capital or liquidity buffers to manage such risk.

40|$|Background Mental {{health of}} the {{adolescents}} is an important global public health concern as {{a leading cause of}} illness and disability not only for the adolescents, but also their family, and the community. In recent years the broader definition of mental health suggests an overall improved well-being as well as absence of illness. Despite the global recognition of the significance of adolescents’ mental health it remains a seriously neglected area in research and policy in Pakistan. This thesis attempts to understand the epidemiology of mental health among Pakistani adolescents by drawing from developmentally informed framework. This thesis proposes that perceptions of relationship with parents and attachment underlie the adolescents’ successful ability to regulate emotions and perceive social support. It also attempts to understand the role of cultural orientation in the pathway of associations between the factors mentioned above. Objectives A quantitative cross sectional design was applied to investigate the state of mental health among Pakistani adolescents. The study also aimed at investigating the validity of constructs of attachment, parental <b>bonding,</b> emotion <b>regulation,</b> social support and cultural orientation in Pakistan and how these factors interrelate in relation to adolescents’ mental health. Methods A sample of eleven hundred and twenty four was recruited from eight secondary schools from the district of Rawalpindi, Pakistan after formal approval from concerned authorities. A battery of self-report measures was administered in class-room setting. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Structural equation modelling (SEM) were used to analyse the data. Results Prevalence of depression and anxiety among this sample was 17. 2...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} the most comprehensive empirical study {{of the effectiveness of}} macroprudential instruments to date. Using data from 49 countries, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of macroprudential instruments in reducing systemic risk over time and across institutions and markets. The analysis suggests that many of the most frequently used instruments are effective in reducing pro-cyclicality and the effectiveness is sensitive to the type of shock facing the financial sector. Based on these findings, the paper identifies conditions under which macroprudential policy is most likely to be effective, as well as conditions under which it may have little impact.

40|$|Rewarding social {{behaviors}} including positive social interactions and sexual behaviors are shown to regulate adult neurogenesis, but the underlying biological mechanisms remain elusive. Oxytocin, a neurohypophysial hormone secreted after exposure to social interaction or sexual behaviors, has a profound {{role in the}} formation of social <b>bonding</b> and <b>regulation</b> of emotional distress. While the acute effect of oxytocin was usually studied, relatively scarce evidence showed the behavioral consequence of repeated oxytocin treatment. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of repeated oxytocin treatment on hippocampal cell proliferation, dendritic maturation of new born neurons and social/emotional behaviors. Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats received treatment with either vehicle or oxytocin (1 mg/kg) daily for two weeks. Behavioral tests revealed that oxytocin increased {{social behaviors}} and reduced the anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Cell proliferation, differentiation and the dendritic complexity of new born neurons in the hippocampus were promoted by oxytocin treatment. Depression- and anxiety-like behaviors were induced by repeated treatment of corticosterone (40 mg/kg) for two weeks while oxytocin treatment reversed the behavioral disturbances. Suppression of cell proliferation caused by corticosterone was reverted by oxytocin treatment in which cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and dendritic complexity increased. The present findings reveal that oxytocin not only enhances cell proliferation, but also promotes the development of the new neurons which is associated with the induction of positive emotional and social behaviors. The results also suggest that oxytocin may be a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of emotional and social dysfunction. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R
40|$|Securitisation {{was heavily}} {{regulated}} after {{the global financial}} crisis because of the blames placed on it. However, a favourable treatment was given to covered bonds - close counterparts of securitised products. This discrimination raised many concerns among the market participants once the dust of the crisis was settled. This study provides a comparative analysis of securitised products and covered bonds. The study starts with {{a review of the}} regulations by providing the detailed information about regulations of both markets and highlights the asymmetry in regulations. After this review, a detailed empirical analysis is performed to assess the credibility of the blames placed on securitised products to identify the actual problems in this market. This empirical analysis also assesses if covered bonds can help in avoiding the problems linked with the securitisation. The data has been collected from 7 major European markets for period of 2000 - 2014. The major blame on securitisation is that it motivates banks to take elevated credit risk. However, the empirical results of the study do not support this blame, rather covered bond issuing banks are also found taking a higher risk in the long run. Moreover, the empirical analysis also shows that securitisation per se does not increase risk in the banking system, but it depends on the volume of issued securities. A non-linear (U-Shaped) relationship is found between securitisation volume and systemic risk. Results also suggest that only bigger banks should be allowed to issue covered <b>bonds.</b> Currently, <b>regulations</b> are trying to control the risk and restart the securitisation market at the same time. Based on empirical findings, the study suggests that flat treatment given to securitisation may not help in meeting these goals. However, incremental regulations might help regulators to achieve above mentioned competing goals...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} seventy years, the {{proposal}} to narrow the scope of banks has occurred more and more frequently in financial debates and research. Narrow banking would prevent deposit-issuing banks from lending {{to the private sector}} and restrict nonbank intermediaries from funding investments with demand deposits. Proponents of narrow banking defend it as a step toward greater financial stability and efficiency. This study reviews the literature on the subject, contrasts the concept of narrow banking with contemporary banking theories, and evaluates the potential consequences of narrow banking on finance and the real economy. The study also runs an empirical exercise to estimate the costs of bank narrowness and draws policy conclusions.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{feasibility}} {{to extend the}} Standard Cost Model (SCM) for calculating the costs of government regulation by taking all transaction costs into account which stem from the principal/agent relationship between regulatory authorities and economic entities. From that perspective these transaction costs do not only relate to the bonding costs of the regulated entities – part of these costs {{can be regarded as}} the administrative burden of regulation for the private sector – but also to the monitoring costs of the regulators and to the residual loss. These latter costs can be regarded as cost to society due to e. g. miscommunication on the aims of regulation, and are, of course, hard to quantify. A cost calculation using the (extended) SCM presumes that the regulatory rules are given and set autonomously by the regulatory authorities. However, it may be welfare enhancing if regulations are fashioned {{in such a way that}} net benefits are optimized. From that perspective the paper looks at the possibility to select optimal regulation by means of a cost benefit analysis. A major argument is that the benefits of regulatory measures, e. g. to internalize external effects, comprise avoiding societal costs associated with no or less <b>regulation.</b> <b>bonding</b> costs, compliance costs, monitoring costs, welfare effects of government regulation...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{a systematic analysis}} of bilateral, source and host factors driving portfolio equity investment across countries, using newly-released data on international equity holdings {{at the end of}} 2001. It develops a model that links bilateral equity holdings to bilateral trade in goods and services and finds that the data strongly support such a correlation. Larger bilateral positions are also associated with proxies for informational proximity. It further documents that the scale of aggregate foreign equity asset and liability holdings is larger for richer countries and countries with more developed stock markets.
