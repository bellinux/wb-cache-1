5|$|Bottom-dwelling {{and perhaps}} {{relatively}} active in nature, the Izak catshark feeds mainly on a {{diverse array of}} bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. A significant portion of its diet may be scavenged from offal discarded by fisheries. This species is oviparous, with females producing encapsulated eggs {{two at a time}} year-round. The Izak catshark is regularly caught incidentally by a South African <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> commercial fishery, but is discarded rather than utilized. Despite the fishing pressure, its population has been increasing and thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Favoring soft-bottomed habitats, the {{peppered}} maskray is a bottom-dwelling predator consuming mainly crustaceans (particularly caridean shrimp) and polychaete worms. It is viviparous, with litter {{sizes of}} one to three. The females supply their developing young with histotroph ("uterine milk") during gestation. Although the peppered maskray is a frequent bycatch of <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries, it is still common and significant portions of its population appear to lie within unfished waters. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the finless sleeper ray can {{generate}} a defensive electric shock from paired electric organs in its disc. It gives birth to live young, with the developing embryos nourished by yolk. A litter size of four has been recorded from one individual. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the finless sleeper ray as Vulnerable. This slow-reproducing species is caught by intensive <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> and possibly other fisheries throughout its range, which likely cause high mortality {{regardless of whether it}} is discarded or utilised.|$|E
40|$|Pelagic {{trawling}} does no harm to {{benthic fauna}} and reduces bycatches, and is sometimes {{an alternative to}} <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> when fishing for cod. Selection abilities {{are the same as}} for <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling.</b> A newly developed concept (also applicable to <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls),</b> which has a four-panel extension and cod-end, stabilises the trawl geometry and improves selectivity...|$|R
2500|$|In 2006, New Zealand Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton {{promised to}} support a global ban on <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> if there was {{sufficient}} support to make that a practical option. <b>Bottom</b> <b>Trawling</b> has been banned in 1/3 of New Zealand's waters (although {{a large percentage of}} these areas were not viable for <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> in the first place) ...|$|R
5000|$|Led {{efforts to}} ban <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling,</b> {{resulting}} in the General Assembly’s 2006 consensus resolution prohibiting, for the first time, <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> in sensitive areas of the high seas.|$|R
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the onefin {{electric}} ray can defend itself with a strong electric shock produced {{from a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs beside its head. It feeds mainly on polychaete worms, and likely gives birth to live young. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. It is often caught incidentally by <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries off South Africa, and may also be impacted by pollution from coastal development.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the sand}} devil {{consists}} mainly of small teleost fishes and squid, which are captured via ambush attack. This species is viviparous, with the unborn young nourished by their yolk sacs. Females have a multi-year reproductive cycle and give birth to 4–25 pups in spring or early summer, following a 12-month gestation period. The sand devil is not aggressive, but may attempt to bite if harassed or captured. Though not valued economically, it is caught incidentally by commercial <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient information to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the cloudy {{catshark}} adapts well to captivity and has {{reproduced in}} the aquarium. It {{is often used}} as a model organism in physiology research. On September 25, 1995, Masuda Motoyashi and colleagues used this species to perform the first successful artificial insemination of a shark or ray. The cloudy catshark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries with bottom fishing nets including trawls and gillnets, {{as well as on}} bottom longlines. Captured individuals are typically discarded, possibly with a high survival rate due to their hardiness. Some 40% of the fish discarded in Yamaguchi Prefecture fisheries are of this species. The <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery operating off Fukushima Prefecture may catch over a ton of cloudy catsharks annually, which are also discarded.|$|E
50|$|Additional to {{the already}} banned <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> {{in the region to}} protect the sea floor, the {{executive}} order makes it a federal policy to support the continued prohibition on <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 2005, the FAO’s General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> below 1000 metres and, in January 2006, {{completely}} closed ecologically {{sensitive areas}} off Italy, Cyprus, and Egypt to all <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> over {{vulnerable}} habitat, however, {{will continue}} within the Exclusive Fishing Zones of most nations until governments have mapped {{the location of}} vulnerable habitats, and taken steps to exclude all <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> activities from these areas.|$|R
5|$|The Izak {{catshark}} is harmless and of no commercial value. It {{is regularly}} caught incidentally (and discarded) by a <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery targeting hake south of Cape Town. In contrast to most cartilaginous fishes, its {{numbers have been}} increasing {{in the presence of}} commercial fishing. The reasons for this may include its high reproductive rate, its breeding in less-fished shallower waters, its hardiness allowing for high post-capture survival, and its opportunistic diet. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has consequently listed the Izak catshark under Least Concern, while still noting that it merits continued population monitoring because of its highly restricted range.|$|E
5|$|The main {{conservation}} {{threat to}} the plain maskray is incidental capture by commercial <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries. In the present day, this is mostly caused by Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery, which operates throughout its range. Although this species is discarded when caught, it is more delicate-bodied than other maskrays and is thus unlikely to survive encounters with trawling gear. Historically, this species {{may also have been}} negatively affected by Japanese, Chinese, and Taiwanese trawlers that fished intensively off northern Australia from 1959 to 1990. These factors, coupled with the plain maskray's limited distribution and low reproductive rate, have resulted in its being assessed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|While {{large enough}} to perhaps be dangerous, the bignose shark seldom comes into contact with humans due to its {{preference}} for deep water. This species is a bycatch of gillnet, <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl,</b> and deep-set pelagic longline fisheries (particularly those targeting tuna) {{in many parts of}} its range. It is regularly taken in Cuban waters and used to produce liver oil, shagreen, and fishmeal. Elsewhere, such as in Southeast Asia, the meat is consumed and the fins shipped to East Asia for shark fin soup. The bignose shark is not used commercially in United States, where it is listed as Prohibited Species under the 2007 Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic tunas, swordfish and sharks, or in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Even {{in areas}} where the bottom {{sediment}}s are ancient, <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling,</b> by reintroducing the sediment into the water column, can create harmful algae blooms. More suspended solids are introduced into the oceans from <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> than any other man-made source.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bottom</b> <b>{{trawling}}</b> is trawling (towing a trawl, {{which is}} a fishing net) along the sea floor. It is {{also referred to as}} [...] "dragging". The scientific community divides <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> into benthic trawling and demersal trawling. Benthic trawling is towing a net at the very bottom of the ocean and demersal trawling is towing a net just above the benthic zone. <b>Bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> targets both bottom-living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic species such as cod, squid, shrimp, and rockfish.|$|R
50|$|Midwater {{trawling}} is trawling, or net fishing, {{at a depth}} that {{is higher}} {{in the water column}} than the bottom of the ocean. It is contrasted with <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling.</b> Midwater trawling is also known as pelagic <b>trawling</b> and <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> as benthic trawling.|$|R
5|$|Fisheries {{operating}} off Portugal and Japan {{are responsible}} for most commercial landings of the kitefin shark, generally as bycatch in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. Portugal reported a kitefin shark bycatch of 282 tons in 2000 and 119 tons in 2003. In {{other areas of the}} northeastern Atlantic this shark is rare and reported catches are likely confounded by misidentifications of other species; some are caught by mixed-species gillnet fisheries operating in deep water west of the British Isles, where surveys suggest that kitefin shark numbers may have declined by 94% since the 1970s. In the Mediterranean, this shark is caught incidentally by <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> and gillnet fisheries. Although it is generally discarded alive, many are unable to return to deep water and do not survive. In the Southern Hemisphere, catches by the Australian South East Trawl Fishery are increasing following the relaxation of regulations regarding seafood mercury content; this species is not included under Australian fishery quotas. New Zealand kitefin shark catches peaked from 1986 to 1997. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the kitefin shark as Near Threatened worldwide, and as Vulnerable in the northeastern Atlantic in light of documented population declines.|$|E
25|$|Commercial {{fishing gear}} {{includes}} weights, nets (e.g. purse seine), seine nets (e.g. beach seine), trawls (e.g. <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl),</b> dredges, hooks and line (e.g. long line and handline), lift nets, gillnets, entangling nets and traps.|$|E
25|$|The gear {{itself can}} vary a great deal. Pelagic trawls are {{typically}} {{much larger than}} bottom trawls, with very large mesh openings in the net, little or no ground gear, and little or no chaffing gear. Additionally, pelagic trawl doors have different shapes than <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> doors, although doors {{that can be used}} with both nets do exist.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, the Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries closed {{an area of}} 1000 km2 at Sula, {{including}} the large reef, to <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling.</b> In 2000, an additional area closed, covering about 600 km2. An area of about 300 km2 enclosing the Røst Reef closed to <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> in 2002.|$|R

25|$|<b>Bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> can be {{contrasted with}} {{midwater}} trawling (also known as pelagic trawling), where a net is towed {{higher in the}} water column. Midwater trawling catches pelagic fish such as anchovies, and mackerel, whereas <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> targets both bottom-living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic species such as cod, squid, shrimp, and rockfish.|$|R
25|$|Neither Figaro {{species is}} commercially {{important}} or significantly threatened by fishing activity, though F. boardmani forms a regular component of <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> bycatch in commercial fisheries within its range. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed F. boardmani as Least Concern and F. striatus as Data Deficient. Like other catsharks, Figaro species pose no danger to humans.|$|E
25|$|Fisheries {{scientist}} Daniel Pauly and economist Ussif Rashid Sumaila {{have examined}} subsidies paid to <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> fleets around the world. They found that US$152 {{million per year}} are paid to deep-sea fisheries. Without these subsidies, global deep-sea fisheries would operate at a loss of $50 million a year. A {{great deal of the}} subsidies paid to deep-sea trawlers is to subsidize the large amount of fuel required to travel beyond the 200-mile limit and drag weighted nets.|$|E
25|$|The Australian sawtail {{catshark}} is {{a frequent}} incidental catch of <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> commercial fisheries operating throughout its range, including the Western Australian Deep Water Trawl Fishery, the South East Trawl Fishery, and the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery. It may be retained and utilized, but is more commonly discarded; the survival rate of discarded sharks is unknown. This species remains widespread and common, and fishing activities {{do not appear to}} pose a substantial threat to its population at present. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the unique}} {{characteristics}} of this ray it is very common {{to be found in}} pet trade, many people ignore the fact that in total maturity the size of the ray exceeds the capacity of many household aquariums. The bluespotted stingray is generally fished for its meat, being either smoked and salted or dried for local markets, but inexpensive due to its small size. It is caught in mass in <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl,</b> trammel, and fish traps. The bluespotted stingray is very venomous and it has a barb approximately [...] long. [...] The venom contains serotonin, 5' nucleotidase, and phosphodiesterase.|$|E
500|$|Harmless {{to humans}} and of little {{economic}} value, the blackmouth catshark is caught incidentally {{in large numbers}} by commercial <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> and longline fisheries. In particular, it {{is among the most}} commonly bycaught sharks in trawls targeting deepwater lobsters and shrimps (Nephrops norvegicus, , Aristeus antennatus, and Aristaeomorpha folicea), operating off Portugal and in the Mediterranean. Most captured sharks are discarded, probably with heavy mortality. Some fisheries, such as those off Portugal and Italy, retain and utilize a small subset of the largest individuals for human consumption fresh or dried and salted, and for leather; the fishing fleet of Viareggio, Tuscany reported landing [...] in 2005. In the northeastern Atlantic, this shark is being increasingly targeted by fishers following the decline of other deepwater shark species.|$|E
500|$|Historical and anecdotal {{evidence}} {{strongly suggest that}} the once-abundant estuary stingray has declined substantially across its range. Although it is not commercially utilized, it faces {{a number of other}} threats. This species is captured incidentally by commercial <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> and gillnet fisheries; bycatch mortality is exacerbated by the practice of [...] "spiking", in which the ray's cranium is pierced with a metal bar or sharpened stick so as to move it. It is also readily caught, and often killed, by recreational anglers. Surveys in Moreton Bay have found fishing-related effects, such as embedded hooks and mutilated tails, in over 10% of the population. Habitat degradation is another major threat to the estuary stingray, especially given its habitat specificity. Its range encompasses some of the most urbanized areas in Australia, where there is extensive land reclamation, water pollution, and construction of flood mitigation barriers on rivers. Finally, this ray's reputation for damaging shellfish has led to persecution by commercial shellfish farmers.|$|E
