40|$|A hybrid continuum-discontinuum {{method is}} {{introduced}} {{to model the}} rock failure process in Brazilian tensile strength (<b>BTS)</b> <b>test.</b> The key component of the hybrid continuum-discontinuum method, i. e. transition from continuum to discontinuum through fracture and fragmentation, is introduced in detail. A laboratory test is conducted first to capture the rock fracture pattern in the <b>BTS</b> <b>test</b> while the tensile strength is calculated according to the peak value of the loading forces. Then the proposed method is used to model the rock behaviour during <b>BTS</b> <b>test.</b> The stress propagation is modelled and compared with those modelled by finite element method in literatures. In addition, the crack initiation and propagation are captured and compared with the facture patter in laboratory test. Moreover, the force-loading displacement curve is obtained which represents a typical brittle material failure process. Furthermore, the stress distributions along the vertical direction are compared with the theoretical solution. It is concluded that the hybrid continuum-discontinuum method can model the stress propagation process and the entire rock failure process in <b>BTS</b> <b>test.</b> The proposed method is a valuable numerical tool for studying the rock behaviour involving the fracture and fragmentation processes...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{deposition}} of low-dielectric constant SiOC(H) films by conventional plasma-enhanced chemical vapordeposition (PECVD) were investigated through various characterization techniques. The results show that, with anincrease in the plasma power density, the {{relative dielectric constant}} (k) of the deposited films decreases whereas therefractive index increases. This is mainly due to the incorporation of organic molecules with CH 3 group into the Si-OSicage structure. It is as confirmed by FT-IR measurements in which the absorption peak at 1, 129 cm- 1 correspondingto Si-O-Si cage structure increases with power plasma density. Electrical characterization reveals that even after fastthermal annealing process, the leakage current density of the deposited films is {{in the order of}} 10 - 11 A/cm at 1. 5 MV/cm. The reliability of the SiOC(H) film is also further characterized by using <b>BTS</b> <b>test...</b>|$|E
40|$|Amorphous SiCN (a-SiCN) is a {{candidate}} for barrier dielectric and has lower dielectric constant (k; 5) relative to the commonly used barrier SiN (k; 7). In this study, we investigate the leaky behavior and barrier characteristics of a-SiCN (k: 4; 5) doped with different nitrogen concentration. The leaky behavior of a-SiCN is Poole–Frenkel at high electric field. This is similar to SiN. Thermal stability of a-SiCN films is good enough to meet the prescription in back-end-of-line fabrication process. The bias-temperature stress (<b>BTS)</b> <b>test</b> has been conducted on a-SiCN to investigate the barrier ability against copper 7 penetration. We find that a-SiCN could sustain the stress of electric field up to 4 mVycm at 150 8 C. In addition, a-SiCN films with higher nitrogen concentration exhibit better barrier property against copper penetration. The SIMS spectra also have been used to monitor the distributions of copper after different BTS conditions, confirming our inference on leakage mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{approach to}} abnor-malities of primary hemostasis {{is still a}} major challenge for clinical labora-tories. In clinical practice, the in-vestigation of unexplained bleeding ideally uses easy, reliable, and inex-pensive screening tests, eventually followed by second-line analyses (1). Because {{of a lack of}} reliable alterna-tives, the bleeding time (<b>BT)</b> <b>test</b> has been widely used for decades. How-ever, the <b>BT</b> <b>test</b> is relatively insensi-tive and nonspecific with respect to identifying abnormalities of primary hemostasis. The diagnostic efficiency of the <b>BT</b> <b>test</b> for prediction of abnor-mal perioperative bleeding has been critically questioned (2 – 5), suggest-ing the need for alternatives. The interaction of citrated whole blood with biochemically active membranes coated with physiologic agonists (collagen and adenosine diphosphate or collagen and epi-nephrine) can be used to trigger platelet activation under high shear rates and generate a stable platelet plug. Abnormal prolongation of clot development can be automatically recorded by the PFA- 100 ® Analyzer (Dade), which reflects potential qual-itative and quantitative abnormali-ties of platelet function. The clinical usefulness of this test has been stud-ied in some clinical settings, includ-ing evaluation of uremia, the labora-tory approach to the diagnosis of von Willebrand disorder and platelet dysfunction, and the monitoring of therapy with antiplatelet drugs (6 – 8). The within- and day-to-day (to-tal) imprecision (CV) of the test are reportedly, 10 % (8). The test may be especially useful in children (9) be-cause the analysis does not require the active cooperation of the patient and uses, 2 mL of blood. We agree with Lehman et al. (5) on the limited clinical impact of discontinuing the <b>BT</b> <b>test,</b> and we believe that auto-mated, in vitro analyzers can be use-ful for the identification of some de-fects of primary hemostasis. The PFA- 100 analysis has replaced the <b>BT</b> <b>test</b> in the evaluation of disorders of primary hemostasis in our laborator...|$|R

40|$|Ciguatera fish {{poisoning}} is a seafood intoxication commonly afflicting island {{communities in}} the Pacific. These populations, which are strongly dependent on fish resources, have developed over centuries various strategies to decrease the risk of intoxication, {{including the use of}} folk tests to detect ciguateric fish. This study aims {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} two folk tests commonly used in Raivavae Island (Australes, French Polynesia) : the rigor mortis test (RMT) and the bleeding <b>test</b> (<b>BT).</b> A total of 107 fish were collected in Raivavae Lagoon, among which 80 were tested by five testers using the RMT versus 107 tested by four testers using BT. First, the performance between testers was compared. Second, the efficiency of these tests was compared with toxicity data obtained via the receptor binding assay (RBA) by assessing various parameter's values such as sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). Comparisons of outcomes between folk tests and RBA analyses were considered: tests used separately or in a parallel versus the series approach by each tester. The overall efficiency of the RMT and <b>BT</b> <b>tests</b> was also evaluated when the judgments of all testers were pooled. The results demonstrate that efficiencies varied between testers with one showing the best scores in detecting toxic fish: 55 % with RMT and 69. 2 % with BT. BT gave the best results in detecting toxic fish as compared with RMT, giving also better agreement between testers. If high NPV and Se values were to be privileged, the data also suggest that the best way to limit cases of intoxication would be to use RMT and <b>BT</b> <b>tests</b> in a parallel approach. The use of traditional knowledge and a good knowledge of risky versus healthy fishing areas may help reduce the risk of intoxication among communities where ciguatera fish poisoning is highly prevalent...|$|R

The frequency of these disorders in women with menstruation problems is determined in this study. Total of 273 patients in reproductive age with menorrhagia were investigated for bleeding disorders in two steps. Step one includes CBC, PT, PTT and <b>BT</b> <b>tests</b> which were performed for all patients; patients diagnosed with an abnormality in step one, included in the second step on whom VWF: Ag, RCO, factors level, RIPA and platelet aggregometry and specific assay according to abnormality in first step were performed.

Frequencies of bleeding disorders for factor deficiency, platelet disorders and vWD were 8, 7. 7 and 5. 9 %, respectively. Furthermore, 5 % patients had abnormal PT, PTT or BT with no definite diagnosis. In this study, the most common bleeding disorder was vWD followed by thrombocytopenia.

40|$|We {{compared}} the CMV Brite Turbo Kit (BT) and the Digene Hybrid Capture CMV DNA (version 2. 0) assay (HC 2) in the quantitation of pp 65 antigenemia and cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA levels in immunosuppressed renal transplant recipients. Of 123 blood specimens collected from 24 renal transplant recipients, BT and HC 2 assays detected 35 and 39 positive samples, respectively. The overall concordance rate {{between the two}} assays was 90 %. Discordant results were observed at low levels of viremia, so that 8 samples were HC 2 positive but BT negative and another 4 were BT positive but HC 2 negative. There was good correlation (R 2 = 0. 766; P < 0. 01) between the levels of CMV DNA and pp 65 antigenemia in the 31 concordant positive samples. Correlation between results obtained with the two assays was confirmed by longitudinal studies for a patient who developed clinical CMV disease. HC 2 may be more sensitive at low viremia levels and allow earlier detection of impending CMV disease. The BT assay offered {{the advantage of a}} rapid (2 -h) turnaround time. We conclude that BT and HC 2 assays have similar sensitivity and efficacy in the diagnosis and monitoring of CMV infection and disease in renal transplant recipients.

40|$|Citrus thrips, Scirtothrips citri (Moulton), is a plant-feeding pest {{most widely}} {{recognized}} for damage caused to citrus and mango fruits. Citrus thrips have {{also become a}} significant pest in California's blueberries. Avocado thrips, Scirtothrips perseae Nakahara, is a pest of avocados (Persea americana Mill. [Lauraceae]) in California. Pesticides are often used to manage these two species of thrips and therefore, the likelihood of resistance development is high. There is increasing pressure in the United States {{to move away from}} broad-spectrum insecticides and focus on alternative methods of control, e. g., genetically modified crop plants expressing Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) toxins, use of biorational insecticides such as toxic Bt protein sprays and entomopathogens (such as various strains of Beauveria bassiana Balsamo, and other agents). Integrated pest management programs are essential for any agricultural commodity. The goal of the work described here is to add to the foundation of knowledge to improve the integrated pest management of citrus thrips and avocado thrips. The research conducted for this disseration 1) examined alternatives to traditional insecticides (Bt protein sprays and several strains of B. bassiana) to control both avocado and citrus thrips in the laboratory and resulted in no efficacy of the <b>Bts</b> <b>tested</b> but one strain of fungus, the commercially available strain was able to infect citrus thrips at field obtainable levels, 2) tested the commercially available strain in different formulations and water regimes against citrus thrips in blueberry fields which resulted in some control but not enough to strongly recommend this as an alternative to traditional pesticides, 3) evaluated the impact of some of the insecticides registered for avocado thrips management on the beneficial native predaceous mite Euseius hibisci Chant in avocado orchards and found that each of the pesticides harmed the mite but at varying levels and durations, 4) assessed citrus thrips oviposition on blueberry varieties with choice and no-choice tests and it was determined that citrus thrips likely oviposit to differing degrees in some plants over others, and finally 5) determined that citrus thrips in the Americas was actually a complex of species that were nearly morphologically identical but molecularly quite distinct...|$|R

40|$|Bluetongue (BT) is a {{commonly}} cited {{example of a}} disease with a distribution believed to have recently expanded in response to global warming. The BT virus is transmitted to ruminants by biting midges of the genus Culicoides, {{and it has been}} hypothesized that the emergence of BT in Mediterranean Europe during the last two decades is a consequence of the recent colonization of the region by Culicoides imicola and linked to climate change. To better understand the mechanism responsible for the northward spread of <b>BT,</b> we <b>tested</b> the hypothesis of a recent colonization of Italy by C.  imicola, by obtaining samples from more than 60 localities across Italy, Corsica, Southern France, and Northern Africa (the hypothesized source point for the recent invasion of C.  imicola), and by genotyping them with 10 newly identified microsatellite loci. The patterns of genetic variation within and among the sampled populations were characterized and used in a rigorous approximate Bayesian computation framework to compare three competing historical hypotheses related to the arrival and establishment of C.  imicola in Italy. The hypothesis of an ancient presence of the insect vector was strongly favoured by this analysis, with an associated P ≥  99 %, suggesting that causes other than the northward range expansion of C.  imicola may have supported the emergence of BT in southern Europe. Overall, this study illustrates the potential of molecular genetic markers for exploring the assumed link between climate change and the spread of diseases.

40|$|Subtraction {{problems}} can be mentally solved with various strategies. One of them is subtraction by addition (SBA), in which one determines how much needs {{to be added to}} the subtrahend to get the minuend (e. g., 75 − 43 =? by 43 +?= 75). Several studies have shown that children hardly report this strategy, which has been hypothetically explained by a lack of understanding of the addition/subtraction complement principle (if a−b=c, then c+b=a). We first confronted 31 third- and 36 fourth-graders with two tasks focussing on the understanding of this mathematical principle (based on Canobi [2009] and Siegler & Stern [1998]). In both tasks, children were instructed to solve each problem as fast and accurate as possible, and after every trial they explained how they solved it. In the Looking-Back Task (LBT) they were also explicitly told that sometimes it might be helpful to look back to the previous problem on top of the screen, in order to find the answer to the next one. This design allowed us to measure the explicit understanding of the complement principle (for 10 target problems). We also conducted a Baseline Task (BT), in which we presented exactly the same problems as in the LBT, but now no helpful preceding items were offered. By comparing children’s speed data on the problems in the LBT with the same problems in this BT, we could measure children’s implicit understanding of the complement principle. Secondly, participants solved a Spontaneous Strategy Use Task (SSUT), in which we focused on children’s use of the SBA strategy with both verbal and non-verbal methods (Authors, in press). The results presented here are preliminary. When looking at the explicit understanding of the complement principle, we found that 15 third- and 25 fourthgraders reported at least once that they used the previously solved problem in the LBT. Focusing on the implicit understanding, we found that 15 third- and 21 fourth-graders performed significantly faster on the target problems in the LBT compared to the <b>BT</b> (<b>tested</b> via one-tailed paired t-tests). Surprisingly, out of these children 3 third- and 2 fourth-graders never reported looking back in the LBT, which suggests that there are differences in the implicit and explicit understanding of the complement principle. In the SSUT, only 6 out of 67 participants reported to use the SBA strategy (1 third- and 5 fourth-graders), with a total of 70 out of 2144 problems (3 %). In contrast, individual strategy use patterns based on children’s RTs strongly suggest that 15 third- and 15 fifth-graders flexibly switched between the traditionally taught subtraction strategy and SBA. We can conclude for now that there are intriguing differences between the data based on verbal and non-verbal methods, both for the identification of children’s strategy use and for their understanding of the complement principle, which definitely need to be further investigated. We hope to get the opportunity to present our final results at the conference, in which we will also include analyses on the relation between the use of SBA and the understanding of the complement principle. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that cardiovascular exercise has positive effects on motor memory consolidation. In this study, we investigated whether a single session of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) mitigates the effects of practicing an interfering motor task. Furthermore, learning and interference effects were assessed in the actively trained and untrained limb {{as it is known}} that unilateral motor learning can cause bilateral adaptations. Subjects performed a ballistic training and then the HIIT either before (HIIT_before) or after (HIIT_after) practicing an interfering accuracy task (AT). The control group (No_HIIT) did not participate in the HIIT but rested instead. Performance in the ballistic task (<b>BT)</b> was <b>tested</b> before and after the ballistic training, after the exercise and practice of the AT and 24 h later. After ballistic training, all groups showed comparable increases in performance in the trained and untrained limb. Despite the practice of the AT, HIIT_before maintained their BT performance after the high-intensity interval training whereas HIIT_after (trend) & No_HIIT showed prominent interference effects. After 24 h, HIIT_before still did not show any interference effects but further improved ballistic motor performance. HIIT_after counteracted the interference resulting in a comparable BT performance after 24 h than directly after the ballistic training while No_HIIT had a significantly lower BT performance in the retention test. The results were similar in the trained and untrained limb. The current results imply that a single session of cardiovascular exercise can prevent motor interference in the trained and untrained hemisphere. Overall learning was best, and interference least, when HIIT was performed before the interfering motor task...|$|R
40|$|Using {{the power}} kernels of Phillips, Sun and Jin (2006, 2007), {{we examine the}} large sample {{asymptotic}} properties of the t-test for different choices of power parameter (rho). We show that the nonstandard fixed-rho limit distributions of the t-statistic provide more accurate approximations to the finite sample distributions than the conventional large-rho limit distribution. We prove that the second-order corrected critical value based on an asymptotic expansion of the nonstandard limit distribution is also second-order correct under the large-rho asymptotics. As a further contribution, we propose a new practical procedure for selecting the test-optimal power parameter that addresses the central concern of hypothesis testing: the selected power parameter is test-optimal {{in the sense that}} it minimizes the type II error while controlling for the type I error. A plug-in procedure for implementing the test-optimal power parameter is suggested. Simulations indicate that the new test is as accurate in size as the nonstandard test of Kiefer and Vogelsang (2002 a, 2002 b; KV), and yet it does not incur the power loss that often hurts the performance of the latter test. The new test therefore combines the advantages of the KV test and the standard (MSE optimal) HAC test while avoiding their main disadvantages (power loss and size distortion, respectively). The results complement recent work by Sun, Phillips and Jin (2008) on conventional and <b>bT</b> HAC <b>testing.</b> Asymptotic expansion, HAC estimation, Long run variance, Loss function, Optimal smoothing parameter, Power kernel, Power maximization, Size control, Type I error, Type II error...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrogen}} (H 2) lactose breath <b>test</b> (<b>BT)</b> is a <b>test</b> {{commonly used}} for the diagnosis of hypolactasia. However, its sensitivity is not always good. In the last few years, the new Quick Lactase Test (QLT) has been developed for endoscopic diagnosis of adult-type hypolactasia. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the efficacy of the new QLT with the traditional H 2 lactose BT for the diagnosis of hypolactasia. Fifty dyspeptic patients (19 male, 31 female, mean age 38 +/- 6) were enrolled in the study. All the patients were subjected to the H 2 lactose BT and to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Two postbulbar duodenal biopsies were {{used for the}} QLT (Biohit, Helsinki, Finland). The duodenum biopsies were incubated with lactose on a test plate: in patients with normolactasia a colour reaction develops as a result of hydrolysed lactose (positive result), whereas no reaction develops in patients with mild or severe hypolactasia (negative results). Twenty-two out of 50 patients (44 %) had a positive H 2 lactose BT. Among them, 21 showed a mild or severe hypolactasia with the QLT. When we considered patients with a negative H 2 lactose BT (28 out of 50), 24 patients showed normal lactase activity in duodenal biopsies with the QLT, whereas in 4 patients there was discordance between the two tests. These patients were re-evaluated with a methane (CH 4) and an H 2 lactose BT and 3 of them were H 2 non-producers with a high level of CH 4 production. Only 1 patient with a negative result in the QLT remains negative to lactose BT. Our study showed a good correlation between the H 2 lactose BT and the new QLT in the diagnosis of adult-type hypolactasia for the majority of patients. However, the QLT seems to be more sensitive than the H 2 lactose BT, helping to identify a subgroup of patients with adult-type hypolactasia with a negative result in the H 2 lactose BT. Based on these results we suggest performing the less expensive and more rapid QLT during the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to evaluate the presence of lactase activity in duodenal biopsies...|$|R

40|$|One {{major concern}} {{regarding}} {{the release of}} Bt rice is its potential impact through tritrophic interactions on nontarget arthropods, especially natural enemies. We studied the effects of two Bt transgenic rice varieties, TT 9 - 3 and KMD 1, expressing Cry 1 Ab/Cry 1 Ac and Cry 1 Ab, respectively, on a predatory ground spider [Ummeliata insecticeps (Bösenberg et Strand) ] supplied with Bt rice-fed brown planthopper [Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) ] nymphs. Although immunoassays confirmed that U. insecticeps ingested Bt insecticidal protein when supplied with Bt rice-fed N. lugens, no negative effects were found on its survival and development. Furthermore, the fecundity of U. insecticeps fed prey reared on Bt rice was {{not significantly different from}} that of those fed prey reared on non-Bt rice. A 3 -yr field trial indicated that Bt rice did not significantly affect the population density of U. insecticeps in comparison with non-Bt rice.

40|$|The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Fig. 1) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} insect pests in maize in Brazil. The damage it causes may reduce yields up to 34 %. Chemical insecticides are currently used to control this pest in the field. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), however, may be a viable and economic alternative for the control of this important corn insect pest. The objectives of this research were three-fold, 1) to survey the presence of Bt strains from different regions in Brazil, 2) to bioassay all collected Bt strains against S. frugiperda larvae, and 3) to develop fermentation media for Bt production using by-products.
