5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, San Francisco spent $1.7million {{each year to}} operate its two fireboats. Maintenance {{problems}} on the historic vessels increased {{to the point that}} Phoenix needed to <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> into dry dock for extensive repairs to the hull. The fireboat was thoroughly renovated in 2004 at Bayside Boatworks in Sausalito, California.|$|E
5|$|During Davuluri's {{visit to}} Central York High School in Pennsylvania, 18-year-old Patrick Farves was {{suspended}} for inviting her to his 2014 prom during a question-and-answer session. Although she requested that the suspension <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> in a Facebook post, school administrators said that they must maintain standards for student behavior. Farves later stated that he regretted the joke as it overshadowed her platform.|$|E

50|$|After Lifter {{arrived at}} the Bay Area in March 2009, {{it was used to}} place pre-fabricated {{falsework}} truss sections and the 28 box girder deck sections. Before the heavy deck sections for the Bay Bridge <b>were</b> <b>lifted,</b> the Left Coast Lifter raised a sunken tugboat in August 2009, USS Wenonah. The first deck section <b>was</b> <b>lifted</b> in February 2010, and the last deck section <b>was</b> <b>lifted</b> in October 2011.|$|R
5|$|In 2012, the F-22 was {{upgraded}} with {{a backup}} oxygen system, software upgrades and oxygen sensors {{to address the}} frequent oxygen deprivation issues and normalize operations. In 2013, the faulty flight vest valves were replaced and altitude restrictions lifted; distance restrictions will <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> once a backup oxygen system is installed. In April 2014, the USAF stated in Congressional testimony that installation of automatic backup oxygen systems on the F-22 fleet would be completed within twelve months.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 2015, Black 5 steam {{locomotive}} 45231 Sherwood Forester was working a WCRC special through Doncaster {{when it was}} noticed that its TPWS had been isolated by the fireman. As a result, in November 2015 a further prohibition notice was issued to WCRC by the ORR, suspending further steam services operated by them. It was reported that locomotives would need to have their TPWS modified to prevent the crew {{from being able to}} isolate it, before this suspension could <b>be</b> <b>lifted.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 22 October, Gosiewski was {{defeated}} by Swedish forces in the Battle of Filipów and turned to Lithuania. Also on 22 October, besieged Dorpat surrendered to Alexis, while the Russian siege of Swedish-held Riga was lifted. John II Casimir meanwhile took Bromberg (Bydgoszcz) and Konitz in Royal Prussia, and from 15 November 1656 until February 1657 stayed in Danzig, where a Swedish siege had to <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> due to Dutch intervention, just 55 kilometers away from Charles X Gustav's quarters in Elbing.|$|E

50|$|There is {{evidence}} that meltwater discharges are episodic. This can result because as water continues to collect, more ice <b>is</b> <b>lifted,</b> and the water moves outward in a growing under-ice lake. Areas where the ice <b>is</b> most easily <b>lifted</b> (i.e., areas with thinner overlying ice sheets) <b>are</b> <b>lifted</b> first. Hence the water may move up the terrain underlying the glacier if it moves toward areas of lower overlying ice. As water collects, additional ice <b>is</b> <b>lifted</b> until a release path is created.|$|R
5|$|The Montana {{class would}} have used {{aircraft}} for reconnaissance and for gunnery spotting. The type of aircraft used would have depended on when exactly the battleships would have been commissioned, but in all probability they {{would have used}} either the Kingfisher or the Seahawk. The aircraft would have been floatplanes launched from catapults on the ship's fantail. They would have landed {{on the water and}} taxied to the stern of the ship to <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> by a crane back to the catapult.|$|E
5|$|Alexios was {{replaced}} as commander by John Tarchaneiotes, first cousin of Andronikos II, and {{disappeared from the}} scene for 30 years. His successors proved greatly inferior, and by 1323, Byzantine possessions in Asia had been greatly reduced. At that point, Patriarch Jesaias urged Andronikos to recall the aged general. A desperate Andronikos agreed and pardoned Alexios in 1324. Alexios was tasked with relieving the isolated exclave of Philadelphia, which had been long under siege {{and was ready to}} fall. He was given no army, but, according to the Byzantine chroniclers, the mere news of Alexios's approach, and the respect in which the Turks held him, was enough for the siege to <b>be</b> <b>lifted.</b> Alexios was appointed governor of the city, a position he retained until 1327.|$|E
5|$|All the {{interesting}} cases of homotopy groups of spheres involve mappings from a higher-dimensional sphere {{onto one of}} lower dimension. Unfortunately, the only example which can easily be visualized is not interesting: there are no nontrivial mappings from the ordinary sphere to the circle. Hence, π2(S1) = 0. This is because S1 has the real line as its universal cover which is contractible (it has the homotopy type of a point). In addition, because S2 is simply connected, by the lifting criterion, any map from S2 to S1 can <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> to a map into the real line and the nullhomotopy descends to the downstairs space.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{expansion}} draft, the trade limitation of allocated-for-same-country-allocated <b>was</b> <b>lifted.</b> [...] Players that were 'unevenly' traded once this restriction <b>was</b> <b>lifted</b> include Amy LePeilbet (to Kansas City), Karina LeBlanc (to Chicago), and Veronica Perez (to Washington).|$|R
50|$|If meltwater accumulates, the {{discharges}} are episodic under continental ice sheets as well {{as under}} Alpine glaciers. The discharge results when water collects, the overlying ice <b>is</b> <b>lifted,</b> and the water moves outward in a pressurized layer or a growing under-ice lake. Areas where the ice <b>is</b> most easily <b>lifted</b> (i.e. areas with thinner overlying ice sheets) <b>are</b> <b>lifted</b> first. Hence the water may move up the terrain underlying the glacier if it moves toward areas of lower overlying ice. As water collects, additional ice <b>is</b> <b>lifted</b> until a release path is created.|$|R

5|$|Data {{from the}} Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere {{satellite}} suggests that noctilucent clouds require water vapour, dust, and very cold temperatures to form. The sources {{of both the}} dust and the water vapour in the upper atmosphere are not known with certainty. The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> through gaps in the tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the stratosphere.|$|E
5|$|In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian {{scene with}} a new {{performance}} – gas ballooning. The first balloon ascent in Australia {{had been made in}} Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The idea that people could <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> from the ground to fly and return safely fired the imagination of the public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very real chance of disaster and injury added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{support for}} Louis' {{campaign}} was diminishing in France, and {{he concluded that}} the war in England was lost. He negotiated terms with Cardinal Guala, under which Louis would renounce his claim to the English throne; in return, his followers would be given back their lands, any sentences of excommunication would <b>be</b> <b>lifted,</b> and Henry's government would promise to enforce the charter of the previous year. The proposed agreement soon began to unravel amid claims from some loyalists that it was too generous towards the rebels, particularly the clergy who had joined the rebellion.|$|E

5|$|The Colonel {{was finally}} {{discovered}} in the Dōtonbori River on March 10, 2009. Divers who recovered the statue at first thought {{it was only a}} large barrel, and shortly after a human corpse, but Hanshin fans on the scene were quick to identify it as the upper body of the long-lost Colonel. The right hand and lower body were found next day, but the statue is still missing its glasses and left hand. It is said that the only way the curse can <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> is by returning his long-lost glasses and left hand.|$|E
5|$|The I-5 was {{involved}} in tests of the Zveno project where a Tupolev TB-3 heavy bomber carried three I-5s as parasite fighters. One I-5 was carried was on each wing and a third over the fuselage. Ramps were used to get the wing-mounted aircraft to their places, but the fuselage-mounted aircraft had to <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> by hand. This was so cumbersome that they were generally used solely as an extra powerplant for the TB-3 later in the program. The aircraft used in these trials used the longer landing gear with smaller tires originally used in the prototypes.|$|E
5|$|The Israeli forces {{amounted}} {{to less than}} a brigade of armor, an infantry brigade, a paratroop battalion, an engineering battalion and five battalions of artillery. The units were divided into four task forces. The largest of these was to cross the Allenby Bridge and reach Karameh from the south; a second one was to cross the Damiyah Bridge, and reach Karameh from the north, thus completing a pincer move. Meanwhile, paratroopers were to <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> by helicopters into the town while the fourth force would make a diversionary attack at King Abdullah Bridge to draw the Jordanian forces from Karameh and to cover the main attack.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{positions}} available to women in the ADF has increased over time. Although servicewomen were initially barred from combat positions, these restrictions began to <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> in 1990. In 2010 approximately 92% of employment categories and 84% of positions in the ADF were available to females as well as males. In September 2011 Minister for Defence Stephen Smith announced that the Cabinet had decided to remove all restrictions on women serving in combat positions, and that this change would come into effect within five years. This decision {{was supported by the}} CDF and the chiefs of the services. Women became able to apply for all positions other than special forces roles in the Army on 1 January 2013. This remaining restriction was removed during 2016.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Hitler's release from prison, {{politics}} in Germany had become less combative and the economy had improved, limiting Hitler's opportunities for political agitation. As {{a result of the}} failed Beer Hall Putsch, the NSDAP and its affiliated organisations were banned in Bavaria. In a meeting with the Prime Minister of Bavaria Heinrich Held on 4 January 1925, Hitler agreed to respect the state's authority and promised that he would seek political power only through the democratic process. The meeting {{paved the way for the}} ban on the NSDAP to <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> on 16 February. However, after an inflammatory speech he gave on 27 February, Hitler was barred from public speaking by the Bavarian authorities, a ban that remained in place until 1927. To advance his political ambitions in spite of the ban, Hitler appointed Gregor Strasser, Otto Strasser and Joseph Goebbels to organise and grow the NSDAP in northern Germany. Gregor Strasser steered a more independent political course, emphasising the socialist elements of the party's programme.|$|E
5|$|Crucial to {{road and}} {{airfield}} development was {{the output of}} the Nine Mile Quarry. Initially it was run by the 1st Army Troops Company, which installed suspended electric lighting, allowing the quarry to be worked around the clock from 30 April 1942. Companies A and C of the 96th Engineer Battalion took over the running of the quarry in June. In turn, they were relieved by C Company of the 2/1st Pioneer Battalion in November. Work went on in three eight hour shifts per day, seven days a week. The face of the quarry was drilled from the top and dropped to the floor by blasting. Knapping hammers were used to break the stone into small pieces that could <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> onto trucks by hand. There were two rock crushers on hand; an old model and a modern mobile diesel crusher supplied by the US Army.|$|E
