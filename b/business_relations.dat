The only connection with the national railway network was by way of the turntable at Quainton Road. The 3rd Duke of Buckingham chaired the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway but its management regarded the Tramway as a nuisance. In the 1870s it charged disproportionately high fees for through traffic between the Tramway and the main line with the intention of forcing the Tramway out of <b>business.</b> <b>Relations</b> deteriorated between Jones and J.G. Rowe, Secretary and Traffic Manager of the A The A's trains at Quainton Road would miss connections with the Tramway, causing milk shipped to Quainton to become unsellable, to the extent that Jones began unloading milk at Waddesdon and shipping it to Aylesbury by road. Although Jones asked the Duke to intervene relations remained poor; in 1888 Rowe blocked the telegraph along the Tramway, and in one meeting Jones and Rowe threatened violence.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{approach}} for {{solving the problem}} of composite process oriented service discovery with preserving <b>business</b> and timed <b>relation.</b> Key to our approach {{is the definition of}} requirement towards service. Such requirement not only constrains the functional semantics on an operation of service, but also constrains the timed and <b>business</b> <b>relation</b> among operations of service. Thus, services fulfilling such requirement can preserve the <b>business</b> and timed <b>relation</b> of the composite process. In order to automatically discover satisfied services, a multilevel matching relation model is defined which includes matching rules on the level of syntactic, functional semantics and behavioral semantics to test whether service is similar to the requirement. And based on such relation model, an algorithm for discovering services for the composite process is proposed. The experimentation shows that the proposed approach can preserve the timed and <b>business</b> <b>relation</b> effectively...|$|R
5|$|In 2013, Steam {{began to}} accept player reviews of games. Other users can {{subsequently}} rate these reviews as helpful, humorous, or otherwise unhelpful, {{which are then}} used to highlight the most useful reviews on the game's Steam store page. Steam also aggregates these reviews and enable users to sort products based on this feedback while browsing the store. In May 2016, Steam further broke out these aggregations between all reviews overall and those made more recently in the last 30 days, a change Valve acknowledges to how game updates, particularly those in Early Access, can alter {{the impression of a}} game to users. To prevent observed abuse of the review system by developers or other third-party agents, Valve modified the review system in September 2016 to discount review scores for a game from users that activated the product through a product key rather than directly purchased by the Steam score, though their reviews remain visible. Alongside this, Valve announced that it would end <b>business</b> <b>relations</b> with any developer or publisher that they have found to be abusing the review system.|$|E

Therefore, the purpose of this dissertation is to explore sponsorship’s effect on <b>business</b> <b>relation</b> development, and in particular to study its effect on <b>business</b> to <b>business</b> <b>relation</b> development.   This dissertation has an abductive research approach and an exploratory research design which is useful in this sparse investigated subject. Furthermore, to be able to thoroughly explore the subject and be adaptable, the primary data is collected using a case study with qualitative interviews in a semi-structured manner.   The findings indicate sponsorship to affect trust, sincerity, and reputation in the <b>business</b> to <b>business</b> <b>relation</b> development, and also assess commitment and credibility to some extent be affected by sponsorship. However, the findings are only a minor contribution to this uninvestigated field, which needs further investigation. Suggestion for future research could be to do a similar investigation on a larger scale, and with a bigger sample.   Since sponsorship is a growing and complex phenomenon, and this dissertation is limited to how sponsorship affects <b>business</b> to <b>business</b> <b>relation</b> development, the findings can be of interest for companies active in the business to business sphere.

25|$|Eleven {{environmental}} organizations condemned the logging in March and later identified the withholding of international aid {{due to the}} political crisis {{as one of the}} most significant problems fueling these illegal activities. In particular, frozen funds from World Bank and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) support capacity building for the national parks, the implementation of chain of custody and tracking for logging, and general funding of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF). In all 70% of the government's operating budget was funded by foreign aid prior to the political turmoil. Since the funding was cut, the government has been strangled by a severe lack of funds, leaving the MEF, for instance, restricted to 10% of its normal budget.

25|$|In 1984, however, Espinoza Campos's reign {{underwent}} a challenge when Juan García Ábrego, {{the head of}} the Gulf Cartel, wanted him dead. Their rivalry for the control of the Gulf Cartel prompted several killings in Matamoros, but García Ábrego managed to eventually wound and kill Espinoza Campos in May 1984 to thereby take control of the criminal organization and align it under a single command structure. With Espinoza Campos dead, his gang disintegrated and joined the lines of García Ábrego, marking the beginning of the modern Gulf Cartel. Malherbe, once close to Espinoza Campos's gang, went on to work with García Ábrego and later became one of his most trusted lieutenants and moneymen. In 1990, Malherbe supervised the Gulf Cartel's cocaine shipments that arrived to the U.S.-Mexico border via aircraft, and was allegedly responsible of arming and handing out uniforms of the Federal Judicial Police to his gunmen. The drugs were supplied by the Rodriguez Orihuela brothers of the Cali Cartel and arrived in clandestine runaways in San Fernando and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. They were then smuggled by land to the United States for future distribution. He was the main enlace (intermediary) of the Gulf Cartel in Colombia, where he held <b>business</b> <b>relations</b> with the top echelons of the Cali Cartel. The supremacy of the Gulf Cartel reached its peak in the 1980s and early 1990s, when it controlled at least one-third of all the cocaine that entered the United States and reportedly made $20 billion annually.|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} later he formed part of a politico-commercial {{expedition}} to Constantinople to establish <b>business</b> <b>relations</b> with Turkey, Poland, and Russia. After a quick trip to Cuba in 1787, he was chosen by Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra {{to go to the}} Pacific Coast of Mexico and the naval base of San Blas, the headquarters for the exploration of the Pacific Northwest. He was a Frigate Lieutenant (Teniente de Fragata) at the time. Alongside went his brother-in-law, Francisco de Eliza, who would distinguish himself as Governor of Fort San Miguel on Vancouver Island's Nootka Sound. On their ship to Mexico was the recently named Viceroy of New Spain, Don Juan Vicente de Güemes Padilla Horcasitas y Aguayo, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo. On February 3, 1790, Caamaño took part on an expedition to the Pacific Northwest. He was commanding the Nuestra Señora del Rosario (also known as the La Princesa), a 189-ton frigate built in San Blas for the exploration of the North. He did not go beyond Nootka on this voyage, but on his next one, in 1792, came as far as Bucareli Bay commanding the frigate Aránzazu, a corvette built at Cavite in the Philippines. By this time he had been promoted to Ship Lieutenant (Teniente de Navío). This expedition did a thorough study of the coast from Bucareli to Nootka, marking the map of Alaska and British Columbia with many names which are there today. Sailing from Nootka on June 13, 1792, Caamaño explored Bucareli Bay, off Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, and anchored in Dixon Entrance on July 20. Then he explored southward, passing through Principe Channel, Nepean Sound, Whale Sound, near the Estevan Group archipelago, then into Caamaño Sound and south through Laredo Channel, between Aristazabal Island and Princess Royal Island, returning to Nootka on September 7, 1792. He named Principe Channel, Laredo Channel, Campania Island, Campania Sound, Aristazabal Island, and Gil Island. George Vancouver adopted these names for his chart.|$|E

As a teenager, Antonio Ezequiel and his brother Osiel earned their living by washing cars at the {{headquarters}} of the Federal Judicial Police in their hometown. By the late 1980s, Cárdenas Guillén started his criminal career under the Gulf Cartel, where he became a high-ranking leader and commanded organized crime activities and drug trafficking in Matamoros. His contact with the police in Matamoros marked the life of the Cárdenas Guillén clan; federal reports of the Procuraduría General de la República (PGR) suggest that the drug lord had solid <b>business</b> <b>relations</b> with police and military men. Witnesses indicate that Antonio frequented public places in Matamoros, Reynosa, Ciudad Victoria, and other cities in the state of Tamaulipas surrounded by a number of municipal and state police officers, whose superiors have allegedly remained loyal to the Gulf Cartel for over half a century. His henchmen reportedly wore bullet-proof vests with the Spanish insignias for the Gulf Cartel (Cártel del Golfo – C.D.G.) embellished across their chests. Although some of Antonio Ezequiel's men were reported to have worn military garbs while on duty, their uniforms have also become more subtle with time. For example, some Gulf Cartel gunmen wear tennis shoes of the same color, caps with the logo [...] "CDG–TT" [...] (Gulf Cartel–Tony Tormenta), or trucks emblazoned with the same logo to help them distinguish themselves from rival gangs.|$|E
