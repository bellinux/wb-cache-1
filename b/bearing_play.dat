In this paper, we introduce the nonlinear dynamical method to study the wheelset bearing vibration signal. Based on the comparative studies of the phase graph and the correlation dimension of the vibration signals under normal condition, outer peeling fault condition and rolling element electric erosion fault condition, the following conclusions are shown: (1) The dynamical behavior of the wheelset bearing with fault is complicated than of the normal condition. (2) The correlation dimension of wheelset bearing is different under normal, outer peeling fault and rolling element electric erosion fault conditions. The correlation dimension can be used in wheelset bearing health monitoring. Therefore, it is quite reasonable to fault diagnosis of wheelset bearing to use nonlinear dynamical method...|$|E

Due to close relationship between motor system development and bearing assembly performance, it is difficult to imagine the progress of modern rotating machinery without consideration of the wide application of bearing. Most faults arising in motors are often linked to bearing faults. This paper presents an experimental study to diagnose the bearing fault with help of Park’s vector approach. The experiment is conducted on 0. 5 hp three phase induction motor. The bearing faults are replicated in the laboratory by drilling the outer and inner race of ball bearing with help of electric discharge machining. The LabVIEW software is used in the experiment to acquire the signal. The acquired signal is analyzed with Park vector approach. The current Park’s vector presentation is generated by programming in LabVIEW.

Detailed engineering analysis of a wheel bearing subsystem under dynamic conditions poses enormous challenges due to the nonlinearity of the problem caused by multiple factional contacts between rotating and stationary parts and difficulties in prediction of dynamic loads that wheels are subject to. Commonly used design methodologies are based on equivalent static analysis of ball or roller bearings in which the latter elements may even be represented with springs. In the present study, an advanced hybrid approach is suggested for realistic dynamic analysis of wheel bearings by combining lumped parameter and finite element modeling techniques.

Failure of such bearings in any one of the critical machine of process industry disrupts entire production process and loads to heavy production loss. Early detection of faults in the bearing is, therefore, highly essential to avoid catastrophic. Monitoring and analysis of vibration signal generated by faults in the bearings helps to diagnose exact fault in the bearings. This paper deals with the study of vibration response of roller bearings by using mathematical model. Mathematical model considers the influence of the bearing structure parameters on the vibration of the system.

40|$|The {{behavioural}} diagnostics of <b>bearings</b> <b>play</b> {{an essential}} role in the management of several rotation machine systems. However, current diagnostic methods do not deliver satisfactory results with respect to failures in variable speed rotational phenomena. In this paper, we consider the Shannon entropy as an important fault signature pattern. To compute the entropy, we propose combining stationary wavelet transform and singular value decomposition. The resulting feature extraction method, that we call stationary wavelet singular entropy (SWSE), aims to improve the accuracy of the diagnostics of bearing failure by finding a small number of high-quality fault signature patterns. The features extracted by the SWSE are then passed on to a kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) classifier. The proposed SWSE-KELM algorithm is evaluated using two bearing vibration signal databases obtained from Case Western Reserve University. We compare our SWSE feature extraction method to other well-known methods in the literature such as stationary wavelet packet singular entropy (SWPSE) and decimated wavelet packet singular entropy (DWPSE). The experimental results show that the SWSE-KELM consistently outperforms both the SWPSE-KELM and DWPSE-KELM methods. Further, our SWSE method requires fewer features than the other two evaluated methods, which makes our SWSE-KELM algorithm simpler and faster...|$|R

In the performance of all motor driven systems, <b>bearings</b> <b>play</b> an important role. The purpose of condition monitoring and fault diagnostics are to detect and distinguish faults occurring in machinery, in order to provide a significant improvement in plant economy, reduce operational and maintenance costs and improve the level of safety. This paper addresses a recent study to employ Wavelet decomposition to process the accelerometer signals and identify band patterns features. Selected features are extracted from the vibration signatures so obtained and these are used as inputs to three types of artificial networks trained to identify the bearing conditions at three different rotational speeds. Vibration signals for normal bearings, bearing with inner race fault, outer race faults and ball faults were acquired from a motor-driven experimental system. The experimental results are presented and compared with those of currently best-performing on this field.

40|$|Rolling <b>bearings</b> <b>play</b> {{a pivotal}} role in {{rotating}} machinery. The degradation assessment and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of bearings are critical to condition-based maintenance. However, sensitive feature extraction still remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, a novel feature extraction method is introduced to obtain the sensitive features through phase space reconstitution (PSR) and joint with approximate diagonalization of Eigen-matrices (JADE). Firstly, the original features are extracted from bearing vibration signals in time and frequency domain. Secondly, the PSR is applied to embed the original features into high dimensional phase space. The between-class and within-class scatter (SS) are calculated to evaluate the feature sensitivity through the phase point distribution of different degradation stages and then different weights are assigned to the corresponding features based on the calculated SS. Thirdly, the JADE is employed to fuse the weighted features to obtain the advanced features which can better reflect the bearing degradation process. Finally, the advanced features are input into the extreme learning machine (ELM) to train the RUL prediction model. A set of experimental case studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the extracted advanced features can better reflect the degradation process compared to traditional features and could effectively predict the RUL of bearing...|$|R

To improve the ability of roller bearing fault diagnosis under multi-rotating situation, this paper proposes a novel roller bearing fault characteristic: the Amplitude Modulation (AM) based correntropy extracted from the Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), which are decomposed by Fast Ensemble Empirical mode decomposition (FEEMD) and employ Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) to implement intelligent fault identification. Firstly, the roller bearing vibration acceleration signal is decomposed by FEEMD to extract IMFs. Secondly, IMF correntropy matrix (IMFCM) as the fault feature matrix is calculated from the AM-correntropy model of the primary vibration signal and IMFs. Furthermore, depending on LSSVM, the fault identification results of the roller bearing are obtained. Through the bearing identification experiments in stationary rotating conditions, it was verified that IMFCM generates more stable and higher diagnosis accuracy than conventional fault features such as energy moment, fuzzy entropy, and spectral kurtosis. Additionally, it proves that IMFCM has more diagnosis robustness than conventional fault features under cross-mixed roller bearing operating conditions. The diagnosis accuracy was more than 84 % for the cross-mixed operating condition, which is much higher than the traditional features. In conclusion, it was proven that FEEMD-IMFCM-LSSVM is a reliable technology for roller bearing fault diagnosis under the constant or multi-positioned operating conditions, and as such, it possesses potential prospects for a broad application of uses...|$|R
