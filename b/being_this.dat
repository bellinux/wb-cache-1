5|$|Aside {{from the}} attack on Ancona, the Austro-Hungarian battleships were {{confined}} to Pola {{for the duration of}} the war. Their operations were limited by Admiral Anton Haus, the commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, who believed that he would need to husband his ships to counter any Italian attempt to seize the Dalmatian coast. Since coal was diverted to the newer Tegetthoff-class battleships, the remainder of the war saw Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand and the rest of the Austro-Hungarian Navy acting as a fleet in <b>being.</b> <b>This</b> resulted in the Allied blockade of the Otranto Strait. With his fleet blockaded in the Adriatic Sea, and with a shortage of coal, Haus enacted a strategy based on mines and submarines designed to reduce the numerical superiority of the Allied navies.|$|E
25|$|Pythagoras {{held that}} {{all things are}} number, and the cosmos comes from {{numerical}} principles. The physical world of becoming is an imitation of the mathematical world of <b>being.</b> <b>This</b> ideas were very influential in Heraclitus, Parmenides and Plato.|$|E
50|$|Glucuronic acid is a sugar acid {{derived from}} glucose, with its sixth carbon atom {{oxidized}} to a carboxylic acid. In living <b>beings,</b> <b>this</b> primary oxidation occurs with UDP-α-D-glucose (UDPG), {{not with the}} free sugar.|$|R
5000|$|Alice A. Bailey {{stated that}} {{communication}} among <b>beings</b> at <b>this</b> level is entirely by telepathy. According to Theosophist Alfred Percy Sinnett, <b>beings</b> at <b>this</b> level can freely roam both in interplanetary space and in nearby interstellar space in full consciousness while physically remaining in their celestialized bodies and carrying on normal {{activities such as}} communicating with other beings. [...] In order for <b>beings</b> at <b>this</b> level {{to be able to}} do this, it would have been necessary for them to have activated their transpersonal chakras. Benjamin Creme and Elizabeth Clare Prophet have stated that <b>beings</b> at <b>this</b> level can teleport as far as the star Sirius.|$|R

25|$|The {{line was}} to be nearly seven miles (11km) in length from a {{triangular}} junction near Haymarket to a triangular junction near Portobello. Portobello was being developed at this time as a marshalling location for goods and mineral traffic destined for points west of Edinburgh; for the time <b>being</b> <b>this</b> included traffic for the train ferry at Granton. The Caledonian objected to the Bill, and succeeded in getting three connecting spurs near Gorgie inserted into the Act, although these were never constructed.|$|E
25|$|According {{to these}} data, in 2011, Portugal didn't present any {{overspending}} neither on {{the coverage of}} social risks (social protection and health) and the slightly high spending on education {{can be related to}} a lag between the average qualifications of Portuguese and their European counterparts, resulting in an eventual attempt to overcome that lag. There have been some remarkable progresses towards that objective, since the school dropout rate fell from 43.6% in 2000 to 23.2% in 2011, <b>being</b> <b>this</b> still the 3rd highest in the EU, where the average was 13.5% in the same year.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} a lengthy memoir to Henry II of France {{concerning}} how Scotland would be governed after Mary, Queen of Scotland, reached her majority, a subject debated by the French parliament in that year. Mary of Guise feared Châtelherault's powers might be increased. She and d'Oisel would dissemble their concerns for the time <b>being.</b> <b>This</b> memorandum continued {{on the subject of}} the arrest in Scotland of an Irishman, George Paris, who carried letters from France and England. Paris's trunk of letters had been seized by the Provost of Edinburgh and taken to Falkland Palace.|$|E
5000|$|Persons of high motive, who, {{based on}} their insight of their own {{suffering}}, seek by all means to stop the suffering of all <b>beings.</b> <b>This</b> is the Mahāyāna Bodhisattva path of the samyaksaṃbuddhas, who practice the six perefections.|$|R

50|$|An important, though easily {{overlooked}} {{aspect of}} Zen is the bodhisattva ideal. It supplements kensho and {{insight into the}} absolute with Karuṇā, compassion with all sentient <b>beings.</b> <b>This</b> ideal {{is reflected in the}} Bodhisattva vow and the Bodhisattva Precepts or jukai.|$|R

25|$|On June 21, 2013, New Flyer Industries {{announced}} {{the acquisition of}} North American Bus Industries, Inc from Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. (Cerberus) for $79 million. The deal was completed later that day. However, New Flyer continued the NABI name for its existing bus products, which continued in production for the time <b>being.</b> <b>This</b> made NABI a subsidiary of New Flyer, using the legal name of NABI Bus, LLC. The Blue Bird school bus production assets {{were not included in}} the sale to New Flyer; they remain owned by Cerberus. As of late 2013, all of New Flyer's metal-structured bus production (with the exception of the MiDi, a product of the New Flyer–Alexander Dennis joint venture) is now under the NABI brand.|$|E
25|$|Both ADHD {{and obesity}} are {{complicated}} disorders and each produces a large impact on an individual’s social well <b>being.</b> <b>This</b> being both a {{physical and psychological}} disorder has reinforced that obese individuals with ADHD need more treatment time (with associated costs), and are at {{a higher risk of}} developing physical and emotional complications. The cognitive ability to develop a comprehensive self-construct and the ability to demonstrate capable emotion regulation is a core deficit observed in people with ADHD and is linked to deficits in executive function. Overall, low executive functioning seen in individuals with ADHD has been correlated with tendencies to overeat, as well as with emotional eating. This particular interest in the relationship between ADHD and obesity is rarely clinically assessed and may deserve more attention in future research.|$|E

25|$|The formula enhances {{all of his}} {{metabolic}} {{functions and}} prevents the build-up of fatigue poisons in his muscles, giving him endurance far in excess of an ordinary human <b>being.</b> <b>This</b> accounts for many of his extraordinary feats, including bench pressing 1200 pounds (545kg) and running a mile (1.6km) in 73 seconds (49mph/78 kph, nearly twice the maximum speed achieved by the best human sprinters). Furthermore, his enhancements are the reason why {{he was able to}} survive being frozen in suspended animation for decades. He is highly resistant to hypnosis or gases that could limit his focus. The secrets of creating a super-soldier were lost with the death of its creator, Dr. Abraham Erskine. In the ensuing decades there have been numerous attempts to recreate Erskine's treatment, only to have them end in failure. Even worse, the attempts have instead often created psychopathic supervillains of which Captain America's 1950s imitator and Nuke are the most notorious examples.|$|E
25|$|He also reached great {{personal}} fame as a portraitist, <b>being</b> <b>this</b> field, {{the one that}} provided him with greater personal success, since still life was considered a lesser genre. He executed a portrait of Philip IV and worked during the 1620s {{in a series of}} portraits of the principal intellectuals and writers of his time, including: Lope de Vega, Francisco de Quevedo, Luis de Góngora, Jose de Valdivieso, Juan Pérez de Montalbán, Juan Ruiz de Alarcón and Francisco de Rioja. On van der Hamen's death, twenty of these portraits were inventoried as a single item among his belongings. The portrait of his older brother, Lorenzo van der Hamen, probably belonged to this series. The series itself was a focal point for philosophic speculation on the art of portraiture by some of the most distinguished minds of the time, who frequently praised Juan van der Hamen in verse and prose.|$|E
25|$|As {{the time}} for voting on the budget approached, Livingstone {{discovered}} that instead of the outright illegality involved in resolving {{not to make a}} rate, the other councils were planning to exploit the legal grey area of refusing to make a rate for the time <b>being.</b> <b>This</b> strategy would put them in a different position to the GLC and ILEA who would be illegal immediately. Budget papers prepared by the Director-General Maurice Stonefrost then revealed that the capping limit still allowed the council to increase spending substantially; the papers were circulated to all members of the GLC on 1 March. A long and acrimonious debate at a Labour group meeting on 4 March agreed by 24 votes to 18 to support the legal budget with its £25m in growth. The GLC Labour group split into three factions, with one group of 10 under John McDonnell insistent on not setting a rate, another of 8 under Ken Livingstone willing to defy the law but also to accept a budget at the cap if that stance failed, and a third group unwilling to support any illegal budgeting.|$|E
50|$|The {{second book}} (mandala) {{of the text}} asserts that the Jyotir-atman (radiant soul) is the {{fundamental}} support of all <b>beings.</b> <b>This</b> is of two forms, one qualified and another unqualified.

500|$|For the {{purposes}} of his contribution, Wissenburg takes many standard contentions in animal ethics for granted. However, he challenges mainstream animal ethicists' tendency to adopt the language of liberalism, which he suggests misconstrues nonhuman animals as individuals and posits false dichotomies about their status. This adoption of liberal ideas can come in Tom Regan's [...] "old" [...] form or Donaldson and Kymlicka's [...] "new" [...] form. Wissenburg challenges Donaldson and Kymlicka's extension of citizenship to nonhuman animals, and instead sketches the outline of an alternative proposal which pays attention to individual animals' modes of <b>being.</b> <b>This</b> he labels, paraphrasing Robert Nozick, [...] "liberalism for humans and feudalism for animals".|$|E

500|$|Despite the band's [...] "gospel" [...] and [...] "ad-libbed" [...] {{approach}} to recording, the Make-Up's live performances were often quite structured, {{as opposed to}} the typical [...] "jam session". [...] Svenonius explained that [...] "there's a skeleton that we create and the form of our shows is unchanging - there's an intro, an outro, a middle break. It's very vaudevillian in form". [...] The Make-Up always wore matching uniforms on stage. [...] Like most of the Make-Up's identity, the uniforms were an ideological statement, meant to [...] " [...] individualism. Instead of there <b>being</b> <b>this</b> person [...] this member, and them having their separate personalities, or having them as separate entities. [...] We're trying to create a unification.

500|$|Weapon XI is {{a genetically}} altered mutant killer. He has powers taken from other mutants killed or kidnapped in the film, {{as well as}} {{retractable}} blades in his arms. He is referred to by Stryker as [...] "the pool, the mutant killer: Deadpool" [...] because the compatible powers of the other mutants have been 'pooled' together into one <b>being.</b> <b>This</b> interpretation of Deadpool is lacking his traditional red suit and mask, and also includes a mouth sewn shut and the abilities of Cyclops' optic blasts, Wraith's teleportation, and samurai swords {{that come out of}} his fists from within his arms, similarly to Wolverine's claws. [...] Ryan Reynolds portrays Weapon XI for close-ups, standing shots, and simple stunts while Scott Adkins is used for the more complicated and dangerous stunt work.|$|E
