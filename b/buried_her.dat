5|$|The {{last half}} of the century's first decade was a time of sorrow, {{loneliness}} and constant work for Pankhurst. In 1907 she sold her home in Manchester and began an itinerant lifestyle, moving from place to place as she spoke and marched for women's suffrage. She stayed with friends and in hotels, carrying her few possessions in suitcases. Although she was energised by the struggle–and found joy in giving energy to others– her constant travelling meant separation from her children, especially Christabel, who had become the national coordinator of the WSPU. In 1909, as Pankhurst planned a speaking tour of the United States, Harry was paralysed after his spinal cord became inflamed. She hesitated to leave the country while he was ill, but she needed money to pay for his treatment and the tour promised to be lucrative. On her return from a successful tour, she sat by Harry's bedside as he died on 5 January 1910. Five days later she <b>buried</b> <b>her</b> son, then spoke before 5,000 people in Manchester. Liberal Party supporters who had come to heckle her remained quiet as she addressed the crowd.|$|E

5000|$|The final scene, {{in which}} Sue reaches toward Carrie's grave, was shot {{backwards}} {{to give it}} a dreamlike quality. This scene was inspired by the final scene in Deliverance (1972). Spacek had insisted on using her own hand in the given scene, so she was positioned under the rocks and gravel. De Palma stated, [...] "Sissy, come on, I'll get a stunt person. What do you want? To be buried in the ground?!" [...] However, Spacek declared, [...] "Brian, I have to do this." [...] De Palma explains that they [...] "had to <b>bury</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Bury</b> <b>her!</b> We had to put her in a box and stick her underneath the ground. Well, I had <b>her</b> husband <b>bury</b> <b>her</b> because I certainly didn't want to <b>bury</b> <b>her.</b> I used to walk around and set up the shot and {{every once in a while}} we'd hear Sissy: 'Are we ready yet?' 'Yeah, Sissy, we're going to be ready real soon.'" ...|$|R

25|$|According to some sources, on {{the morning}} of her death, she took a bath, put on new clothes and lay down in bed. She asked for Ali and {{informed}} him that her time to die was very close. Upon hearing this news, Ali began to cry but was consoled by Fatimah who asked him to look after her two sons and for him to bury her without ceremony. It is further stated that her two sons were the first family members to learn of her death and immediately proceeded to the mosque to inform their father. Upon hearing the news, Ali fell unconscious. After recovering he followed Fatima's wishes and performed the janazah. He <b>buried</b> <b>her</b> during the night on 13 Jumada al-awwal 11AH (632 AD), also making three false graves to ensure her real grave could not be identified. With him were his family and a few of his close companions. After her death, Ali followed her wishes and <b>buried</b> <b>her</b> without informing the Medinan people.|$|E

6000|$|... 'The first {{question}} {{was how to}} dispose of the body. The impulse of the moment was to <b>bury</b> <b>her</b> at once in the pit between the engine-house and waterfall; but it struck me that I should not have time. It was now four o'clock, and the working-men would soon be stirring about the place. I would put off <b>burying</b> <b>her</b> till the next night. I carried her indoors.|$|R
25|$|At about 2:30 pm on 27 September, {{police arrested}} Adrian Ernest Bayley, then 41, at his address in Coburg, and then {{questioned}} him at great length.

25|$|Lady Mountbatten died in {{her sleep}} at age 58 of unknown causes in 1960 in Jesselton (now Kota Kinabalu), British North Borneo (now Sabah), while on an {{inspection}} tour for the St John Ambulance Brigade.

25|$|Twelvers {{believe that}} Umar {{pushed his way}} into Ali's house and Fatimah, who was pregnant, was crushed behind the door. She miscarried her unborn son, whom the Shia mourn as Muhsin ibn Ali, and soon died of her injuries. Ali <b>buried</b> <b>her</b> {{secretly}} at night, since {{he did not want}} Abu Bakr or Umar (whom he blamed for her death) to attend her funeral, and the Shia blame Abu Bakr and Umar for the deaths of Muhammad's daughter and grandson.|$|E

25|$|Zhang Shijie, having {{escaped the}} battle, {{hoped to have}} Dowager Yang appoint the next Song emperor, and from there {{continue}} to resist the Yuan dynasty. However, after hearing of Emperor Huaizong's death, Dowager Yang also committed suicide at sea. Zhang Shijie <b>buried</b> <b>her</b> at the shore. He and his remaining soldiers were assumed to have drowned at sea, as a tropical storm whipped up soon afterwards. However, there have been suggestions that his death was simply Mongolian propaganda, since no remains or trace of his fleet were ever found.|$|E
25|$|Thérèse {{was buried}} on 4 October 1897, in the Carmelite plot, in the {{municipal}} cemetery at Lisieux, where {{her parents had}} been <b>buried.</b> <b>Her</b> body was exhumed in September 1910 and the remains placed in a lead coffin and transferred to another tomb. In March 1923, however, before she was beatified, her body was returned to the Carmel of Lisieux, where it remains. The figure of Thérèse in the glass coffin is not her actual body but a gisant statue based on drawings and photos by Céline after Thérèse's death. It contains her ribcage and other remnants of her body.|$|E
25|$|Jacob {{then made}} a further move while Rachel was pregnant; near Bethlehem, Rachel went into labor and died as {{she gave birth to}} her second son, Benjamin (Jacob's twelfth son). Jacob <b>buried</b> <b>her</b> and erected a {{monument}} over her grave. Rachel's Tomb, just outside Bethlehem, remains a popular site for pilgrimages and prayers to this day. Jacob then settled in Migdal Eder, where his firstborn, Reuben, slept with Rachel's servant Bilhah; Jacob's response was not given at the time, but he did condemn Reuben for it later, in his deathbed blessing. Jacob was finally reunited with his father Isaac in Mamre (outside Hebron).|$|E

25|$|Schmid and {{his friends}} took Rowe to the desert, where Schmid and Saunders murdered her. Before murdering Alleen, Schmid told Saunders to rape her, but he couldn't do it, because Saunders was gay. While the murder occurred, Mary French {{was waiting in the}} car and {{listening}} to the radio. Afterwards the three <b>buried</b> <b>her.</b> When Alleen went missing, her father told her mother he felt she had been murdered and left in the desert. The mother, Norma Rowe, went to the police and was told that she needed more evidence before they could go looking in the desert.|$|E
25|$|The {{first person}} Christie {{admitted}} to killing was Ruth Fuerst, a 21-year-old Austrian munitions worker who supplemented her income by occasionally engaging in prostitution. Christie {{claimed to have}} met Fuerst while she was soliciting clients in a snack bar in Ladbroke Grove. According to his own statements, on 24 August 1943, he invited Fuerst to his home to engage in sex (his wife was visiting relatives at the time). Afterwards, Christie impulsively strangled her on his bed with a length of rope. He initially stowed Fuerst's body beneath the floorboards of his living room, and <b>buried</b> <b>her</b> body in the back garden the following evening.|$|E
25|$|The Jin Shu {{mentioned}} that Chen Shou took {{a leave of}} absence when his mother died, and he fulfilled her dying wish to be buried in Luoyang. However, he ended up being castigated and demoted because his act of burying his mother in Luoyang – instead of in his hometown in Anhan County – was a violation of the proprieties of his time. The Huayang Guozhi gave a varying account of the events: It was Chen Shou's stepmother (not his biological mother) who died. She {{did not want to be}} buried together with his father (in Anhan County), so Chen Shou <b>buried</b> <b>her</b> in Luoyang.|$|E

Tearlessly and pitilessly she had left it to strangers to <b>bury</b> <b>her</b> brother's daughter; and now, tearlessly and pitilessly, there stood her brother's son, leaving it to strangers to <b>bury</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{case against}} Chapman rests {{mainly on the}} point that he {{undoubtedly}} was a violent man with a misogynistic streak. He was known to beat his common-law-wives and was prone to other violent behaviour. While living in the US, Chapman allegedly forced his wife, Lucy Klosowska, down on their bed and began to strangle her, only stopping to attend to a customer who walked into the shop which adjoined their room. When he left, she was said to have found a knife under the pillow. He reportedly later told her that he had planned to behead her, even pointing out the spot where he would have <b>buried</b> <b>her</b> and reciting what he would have said to their neighbours.|$|E
25|$|Cárdenas Hernández {{committed}} his {{murders in}} August and September 1942. On 15 August 1942 he was visited {{in his house}} in the Tacuba neighborhood of Mexico City by 16-year-old prostitute María de los Ángeles González. After having sex with her, Cárdenas strangled De los Ángeles and <b>buried</b> <b>her</b> body in his garden. In the following weeks he also murdered prostitutes Rosa Reyes and Raquel Martínez de León, both aged 16, and finally 19-year-old fellow chemistry student Graciela Arias Ávalos. His neighbors started to get suspicious and informed the police. Shortly before the police exhumed the bodies, Cárdenas had himself committed to a psychiatric hospital, where he was arrested on 7 September 1942.|$|E
25|$|Different {{versions}} of Gaspar's legend relate different episodes in his piratical career. One {{of the most}} famous involves a Spanish (or Mexican) princess Gaspar had captured. Allegedly named Useppa, she consistently rejected the pirate's advances until he threatened to behead her if she would not submit to his lust. Still she refused, and he killed her in a rage (or alternately because his crew demanded her death). The captain instantly regretted the deed and took her body to a nearby island, which he named Useppa in her honor, and <b>buried</b> <b>her</b> himself. Some versions identify the lady with Josefa de Mayorga, daughter of Martín de Mayorga, viceroy of New Spain from 1779 to 1782, and contend that the island's name evolved over time. Similarly, Sanibel Island {{is said to have been}} named by Gaspar's first mate, Roderigo Lopez, after his lover whom he had left back in Spain. Empathizing with his friend's plight, Gaspar eventually allowed Lopez to return home, and even trusted him with his personal log.|$|E

5000|$|Sri Sunama maatha {{was born}} in Malkari family from Are-Katika {{community}} at Pinnepalli village of Yadiki mandal, Tadipatri taluk, Anantapur district (officially: Anantapuramu), Andhra Pradesh state of India. She married to Hanumanthakari Thanji Rao {{at a very young}} age. She was very devotional and use to observe fasting very often. One day during fasting she went unconscious. Her husband thought that she is dead and ordered to <b>bury</b> <b>her.</b> Localites requested her husband to pass on the message to her mother, father and brothers who live in Pinnepalli village. Her husband did not allow this. As localites were getting ready to <b>bury</b> <b>her,</b> they found that Sunama maatha is still alive and informed the same to her husband. Under alcohol effect her husband ordered them to <b>bury</b> <b>her</b> anyways. In that sense Sunama maatha has taken jeeva samadhi (Buddhism: Nirvana). It is estimated that this incident took place around 1803 AD.|$|R
