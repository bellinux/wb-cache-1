5000|$|Following a {{controversial}} {{presidential election in}} 2011, Islamic and Christian leaders met with Samuel Fonkam Azu'u, {{the head of the}} electoral commission ELECAM, in order to push for reforms demanded by the opposition. The measures included: <b>biometric</b> <b>registration</b> of voters as the previous election had multiple and non-existing voters, a single ballot paper for presidential elections, eligibility of independent candidates, eligibility of 18-year-olds to vote from the current 20 minimum requirement, recompilation of voter registers, two-round presidential election, establishing an electoral calendar, [...] "harmonisation" [...] of electoral laws and a [...] "truly independent" [...] electoral commission. Azu'u and Prime Minister Philemon Yang then worked with leaders of various political parties, religions, traditional groups leaders and foreign service officers to create an electoral code. Modibo Bouba Bello, {{the vice president of the}} Islamic Council, said that [...] "it is our duty as servants of Allah to ensure that truth, transparency and justice reigns in our country, and this begins with elections in which every ballot counts," [...] while he was supported by Reverend Sebastian Wongo Behong, the secretary general of the Cameroon Episcopal Conference, and Reverend Robert Ngoyek, the president of the Council of Protestant Churches. Behong said that [...] "many democratising countries have frequently gone into chaos because of badly-organized elections. The electoral malpractices that are frequently observed in Cameroon could be leading the country towards a precipice." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{biometrics}} {{market in}} Germany experienced enormous growth between the years 2005 and 2009. [...] "The market size will increase from approximately 120 million € (2004) to 377 million €" [...] (2009). [...] "The {{federal government will}} be a major contributor to this development". In particular, the biometric procedures of fingerprint and facial recognition can profit from the government project.In May 2005 the German Upper House of Parliament approved the implementation of the ePass, a passport issued to all German citizens which contain biometric technology. The ePass has been in circulation since November 2005, and contains a chip that holds a digital photograph and one fingerprint from each hand, usually of the index fingers, though others may be used if these fingers are missing or have extremely distorted prints. [...] "A third biometric identifier - iris scans - could be added at a later stage".An increase in the prevalence of biometric technology in Germany is an effort to not only keep citizens safe within German borders but also to comply with the current US deadline for visa-waiver countries to introduce biometric passports. In addition to producing biometric passports for German citizens, the German government has put in place new requirements for visitors to apply for visas within the country. [...] "Only applicants for long-term visas, which allow more than three months' residence, will be affected by the planned <b>biometric</b> <b>registration</b> program. The new work visas will also include fingerprinting, iris scanning, and digital photos".|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe European Union (EU) policy puts {{a strong}} {{emphasis}} on the fight against irregular immigration, which might occur either through fraudulent entry or through illegal overstay of a regular visitor. The surveillance of its external borders, and especially that of the Schengen space where internal borders checks have been abolished, has thus been the objective of several enacted legislative provisions and implementation programmes. Confronted to the paradox of realizing its political will to increase the efficiency of its border control process {{while at the same time}} comply with the fundamental right of EU citizens to their free movement in the European space, the EU has decided to rely as much as possible on the use of information and communication technologies to implement its border control policies. To this end, and following-up on an earlier Communication on “Preparing the next steps in border management in the European Union” published in 2008, the European Commission (EC) issued in October 2011 a new Communication proposing a “Smart Border” programme and examining the options for its implementation to control the EU borders by electronic means. This “Smart Border” package aims at creating a new Entry/Exit System (EES) allowing to control not only incoming but also outgoing movements and a Registered Traveller Program (RTP) for frequent, pre-screened travellers. This package will add to the numerous existing mechanisms and databases, such as: EuroDac for asylum seekers; Passenger Name Records programmes for travellers pre-screening, the Visa Information System (VIS); the Schengen Information System; and many others. It will be interconnected or at least be interoperable to some of them. While most of the existing databases include biometric identifiers among the collected and processed personal data, the “Smart border” package proposal is intended to only include alphanumeric data in a first phase, leaving the possibility to include biometric identifiers in a second step. This proposed choice results from the observation that, although the inclusion of biometrics would immediately make the EES more efficient, it would have a negative impact on foreigners not requiring a visa (others being already identified using the VIS). Our proposed presentation will analyse the impact on fundamental human rights of this new EU “Smart Border” proposal, in relation with already existing mechanisms and databases for the control of migrants. Furthermore, it will show through our research conducted on the French immigration control legislation, practices and systems by information and communication means, how such policies are going well beyond the sole external borders control, to rather implement a full biometric monitoring of foreigners: from their very first visa request at a EU Member State consulate in their country of origin to their – voluntary or forced - return to this country, including their <b>biometric</b> <b>registration</b> and control during their stay as visitors or as regular foreign residents. We will show through this analysis how immigration control policies are intertwined with criminal policies, implying that migrants and foreigners are treated with the genral suspicion of being a criminal...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCivic mindedness and the {{perceptions}} of trustworthiness, usefulness, {{and ease of use}} seem to explain much of the effective use of websites. This article discusses the extent to which such factors influence the use of government websites based on a study with 210 citizens who were doing their <b>biometric</b> electoral <b>registration</b> in João Pessoa – a major city in Brazil. With the help of ordinary least squares and quantile regression models, we found that there is mixed influence of those factors on the use of government websites. On average, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use had a significant influence; but for low levels of use, only perceived usefulness had an influence, whereas perceived ease of use had an influence for moderate and high levels of use. In terms of trustworthiness, only the dimension about trust in government had an influence for all levels of use. In terms of civic mindedness, only the dimension about civic engagement had an influence, except for moderate levels of use. Our results reinforce that the development of government websites should focus on the citizens’ individual profiles and levels of use, that is, focus should be directed to the demand side (users) besides merely addressing the legal requirements and the provision of services by the supplier (government) ...|$|R
30|$|Firstly, {{the user}} will select {{the mode of}} operation. In the {{training}} mode, the access-control system requests the user to type in the login ID and a new password. The system then asks the user to reenter the password several times in order to stabilize his/her typing pattern. The resulting latency and pressure keystroke templates are saved in the database. During training, if the user mistypes the password the system prompts user to reenter the password from the beginning. The use of backspace key is not allowed as it disrupts the <b>biometric</b> pattern. When <b>registration</b> is done, system administrator uses these training samples to model user keystroke profiles. The design of user profiles is done offline.

40|$|Fingerprint {{biometric}} is {{the most}} widely deployed trait in biometric recognition systems. This {{is largely due to}} its level of acceptance and cost effective integration in existing and new technologies. Fingerprint has been the form for casting votes in elections hence the logical biometric to integrate in E-voting systems.

This paper proposes a scheme for voter <b>registration,</b> <b>biometric</b> enrolment, verification and voting from any polling centre within the country and an indexing technique that would facilitate the search for a matching identity to an input fingerprint. In other words, a registered voter does not need to cast his/her vote where s(he) registered.
