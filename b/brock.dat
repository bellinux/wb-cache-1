5|$|A three-part series, {{published}} between March and May 1997, {{which follows}} <b>Brock</b> {{as he is}} captured and tried for his crimes as Venom. <b>Brock</b> is represented by Matt Murdock (Daredevil), with Cletus Kasady (Carnage) testifying against him. After Kasady bonds again with his symbiote, <b>Brock,</b> Daredevil and Spider-Man unite to stop him. Before <b>Brock</b> can be judged, agent Daryll Smith (from an unknown agency) offers <b>Brock</b> amnesty in exchange for becoming an agent.|$|E

5|$|His nephew and biographer (Ferdinand <b>Brock</b> Tupper) {{asserts that}} shortly after <b>Brock</b> joined the regiment, a {{professional}} dueller forced a match on him. As the one being challenged <b>Brock</b> had {{his choice of}} terms, and he insisted that they use pistols. His friends were shocked as <b>Brock</b> was a large target and his opponent an expert shot. <b>Brock,</b> however, refused to change his mind. When the duellist arrived at the field, he asked <b>Brock</b> to decide how many paces they would take. <b>Brock</b> insisted that the duel would take place not at the usual range, but at handkerchief distance (i.e., close range). The duellist declined and subsequently {{was forced to leave}} the regiment. This contributed to Brock's popularity and reputation among his fellow officers, as this duellist had a formidable reputation and was reportedly regarded as a bully in the regiment. During his time with this regiment, <b>Brock</b> served in the Caribbean, where he fell ill with fever and nearly died. He did not fully recover until after returning to England in 1793.|$|E

5|$|In 1801 while {{aboard the}} 74-gun HMS Ganges (commanded by Captain Thomas Fremantle, a {{personal}} friend), <b>Brock</b> {{was present at}} the Battle of Copenhagen. His troops were supposed to lead an assault on the forts at Copenhagen. The outcome of the sea battle made such an assault unnecessary, and <b>Brock</b> was able to observe first-hand the tactical brilliance of Lord Nelson. After the battle, Fremantle and <b>Brock</b> celebrated the victory with Nelson. In 1802 <b>Brock</b> and the 49th Foot were ordered to Canada.|$|E
5|$|Abum tells another story, {{which he}} {{believes}} shows that mankind no longer needs demonic temptation to be damned. Abum followed an everyman figure called <b>Brock,</b> watching his grindingly repetitive life. <b>Brock</b> visited {{a strip club}} often but without joy, which led Abum to believe he no longer took pleasure from sinning. One day, Abum added an additional irritation to Brock's life, posing as a traffic warden and giving him a ticket. This was enough to drive <b>Brock</b> to suicide. However, during this time, Abum also encountered Black, who again saw his demonic nature.|$|E
5|$|Although many Canadians {{have come}} to view <b>Brock</b> {{as one of their}} own, <b>Brock</b> never really felt at home in Canada. On the whole, he viewed the country as a backwater, and earnestly wished to return to Europe to fight against Napoleon. <b>Brock</b> mistrusted the Canadian colonists, many of whom he {{suspected}} of being American sympathizers, and he was reluctant to arm them indiscriminately to help defend the colonies. He favoured expansion of volunteer forces which could be trained and supervised, as well as the use of British regulars and Tecumseh's warriors.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of Joseph <b>Brocks</b> and his wife, Edna. <b>Brocks</b> was {{the subject}} of a bitter battle to prevent his {{extradition}} from Los Angeles to Alabama. The extradition saga began in December 1948, when <b>Brocks</b> and his wife were Christmas shopping in Los Angeles. A police officer accused <b>Brocks</b> of commiting a burglary and took him to the police station, where <b>Brocks</b> was quickly cleared of the charge. But while he was being fingerprinted, police discovered that <b>Brocks</b> was wanted in Alabama, where he had escaped from a chain gang almost six years earlier. At that time, <b>Brocks</b> was known as Bernard White, and was sentenced to serve 10 years on a chain gang after he made a forced confession that he had stolen a bicycle and illegally entered a private home in Thomasville, Ala. White escaped from the chain gang after serving almost three months, changed his name to Joseph <b>Brocks,</b> and moved to Los Angeles. During the extradition battle, <b>Brocks</b> was represented by attorneys affiliated with the Los Angeles Civil Rights Congress (CRC). Attorneys maintained <b>Brocks</b> should not be extradited to Alabama because he would be sentenced to death by the racist Southern justice system. Local chapters of the International Longshoremen and Warehousemens Union, International Ladies Garment Workers Union, Mine and Mill and Smelters Workers Union, and several other unions joined in Brocks' defense. Brocks' defenders urged California Gov. Earl Warren to refuse extradition, but Warren honored Alabama's request to reopen Brocks' case. On Feb. 28, 1949, <b>Brocks</b> was taken to an Alabama prison and placed in a death cell. The Civil Rights Congress continued to campaign for Brocks' release...|$|R

5|$|As Upper Canada's administrator, <b>Brock</b> made {{a series}} of changes to prepare for war. He amended the militia act to allow use of all {{available}} volunteers and ordered enhanced training of these raw recruits, despite opposition from the provincial legislature. He continued strengthening and reinforcing defences. <b>Brock</b> also began seeking out First Nations leaders, such as the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, to build alliances with him against the Americans in the event of war. Although the conventional wisdom of the day was that Canada would fall quickly {{in the event of an}} invasion, <b>Brock</b> pursued these strategies to give the colony a fighting chance.|$|E
5|$|<b>Brock</b> {{was born}} at St Peter Port on the Channel Island of Guernsey, the eighth son of John <b>Brock</b> (1729–1777), a {{midshipman}} in the Royal Navy, and Elizabeth de Lisle, daughter of Daniel de Lisle, then Lieutenant-Bailiff of Guernsey. The Brocks were an English family who had been established in Guernsey since the sixteenth century. <b>Brock</b> earned a reputation during his early education on Guernsey as an assiduous student, {{as well as an}} exceptional swimmer and boxer. At age ten, he was sent to school in Southampton. He also studied for one year in Rotterdam, learning French.|$|E
5|$|Here, <b>Brock</b> met Tecumseh, and was {{immediately}} impressed. <b>Brock</b> also read American dispatches captured from Hull's army. He quickly judged Hull to be timid and afraid of the First Nations in particular, and the American force to be demoralised and short of rations. Against {{the advice of his}} officers, <b>Brock</b> immediately prepared to launch an attack on Detroit.|$|E

50|$|<b>Brocks</b> Gap Dam was a never-built {{proposal}} for a water storage dam on the North Fork of the Shenandoah River at <b>Brocks</b> Gap in northwest Virginia. The proposal by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers encountered opposition from local residents and was withdrawn in 1967.|$|R
5|$|In November 1979, <b>Brock</b> met Aaron Fechter of Creative Engineering, Inc. Concerned that Fechter's {{animatronics}} {{would be}} too strong a competition for Bushnell’s work, <b>Brock</b> requested that Bushnell release him from the co-development agreement, citing misrepresentation. In December 1979, <b>Brock</b> and Fechter formed “Showbiz Pizza Place Inc”, severing Brock's business relationship with Bushnell. ShowBiz Pizza Place was conceptually identical to Pizza Time Theatre in all aspects except for animation, which would be provided by Creative Engineering. Showbiz Pizza Place opened its first location on March 3, 1980, in Kansas City, Missouri.|$|E

This series also introduces another romantic interest for <b>Brock</b> (Elizabeth, a doctor) in addition to Beck. It also begins a plot thread in which <b>Brock</b> is informed {{that there are other}} symbiotic hosts like himself.|$|E

5|$|The initial six-part {{series was}} {{published}} between February and July 1993. The story follows former reporter Eddie <b>Brock,</b> first introduced in The Amazing Spider-Man #300 (May 1988), as a villain and {{enemy of the}} superhero Spider-Man. In his appearances in The Amazing Spider-Man, <b>Brock</b> blames Spider-Man for ending his career by debunking one of his stories. He bonds with the Venom symbiote, a sentient alien that had previously bonded with (and been rejected by) Spider-Man. Together, <b>Brock</b> and the symbiote become Venom. In The Amazing Spider-Man #375, <b>Brock</b> makes peace with Spider-Man after he saves Brock's wife (Ann Weying) from death. <b>Brock</b> then moves {{back to his home}} city of San Francisco for a fresh start, starting the events of Venom: Lethal Protector.|$|E
5|$|This three-part finale to the Venom {{series was}} {{published}} between November 1997 and January 1998. The Overreach Committee (the organization {{in charge of}} Brock's clandestine agency) decides to terminate {{him because of his}} brutal methods. <b>Brock</b> cuts the bomb from his chest, and uses it to escape. His escape brings him into a confrontation with Spider-Man. After a fight with Spider-Man and an injection of dopamine blockers by Agent Smith, <b>Brock</b> is separated from the symbiote (which is apparently killed when <b>Brock</b> is re-arrested). The final issue sees <b>Brock</b> recover some memory of his history with Spider-Man; he had lost his knowledge of the hero's secret identity in the Spider-Man/Venom single issue (December 1997).|$|E
5|$|Under the symbiote's influence, Peter exposes rival {{photographer}} Eddie <b>Brock,</b> whose fake photos depicted Spider-Man as a criminal. Soon afterward, to make Mary Jane jealous, Peter brings Gwen to {{the nightclub}} where Mary Jane now works, but Gwen catches on and leaves. Peter brawls with the bouncers and, after accidentally hurting Mary Jane, {{he realizes that}} the symbiote is corrupting him. Retreating to a church bell tower, he discovers that he cannot remove the suit, but that the symbiote weakens when the bell rings. Peter is able to remove the symbiote, and it falls to the lower tower, landing on <b>Brock,</b> who had been praying for Peter's death. The symbiote bonds to <b>Brock,</b> transforming him into Venom. <b>Brock</b> locates Marko and convinces him to join forces to defeat Peter. <b>Brock</b> hijacks a taxi with Mary Jane on board, and hangs it as bait from a web above a construction site, while Marko keeps the police at bay. Peter seeks Harry's help, but is rejected. While Peter battles <b>Brock</b> and Marko, Harry learns the truth about his father's death from his butler, and goes to help Peter as he is being overpowered, resulting in a battle between the four. Harry subdues the Sandman before assisting Peter against <b>Brock.</b> In the ensuing battle, <b>Brock</b> attempts to impale Peter on Harry's glider, but Harry intervenes and is impaled himself. Remembering the symbiote's weakness, Peter assembles a perimeter of metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening Venom, and allowing Peter to separate <b>Brock</b> and the symbiote. Peter activates a pumpkin bomb from Harry's glider to destroy the symbiote, but <b>Brock</b> dives in, and the bomb kills them both.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{the opening}} of ShowBiz Pizza Place, Bushnell sued <b>Brock</b> and Topeka Inn Management over breach of contract. <b>Brock</b> {{immediately}} issued a counter-suit against Bushnell, citing misrepresentation. The court case began in March 1980, eventually settling out of court with Showbiz agreeing to pay Pizza Time Theatre a portion of its profits over the following decade. During this period, Topeka Inn Management also {{changed its name to}} <b>Brock</b> Hotel Corporation and moved its headquarters to Irving, Texas. Both restaurants experienced increased success as the video game industry became more robust, and, to maintain competition, both franchises continually modified and diversified their animatronic shows.|$|E
5|$|A four-part series {{published}} between August and November 1996, Venom: The Hunger {{introduces the}} Venom symbiote's reliance on phenethylamine for survival (which requires it to eat human brains after depleting Brock's {{supply of the}} chemical) and reveals that chocolate {{is a source of}} the chemical. <b>Brock</b> refuses to eat human brains; the symbiote abandons him, and he is locked in an asylum under the care of the deranged Dr. Paine. <b>Brock</b> escapes to hunt the symbiote, which has gone on a killing spree to obtain brains. He reunites with the symbiote (after finding an alternative source of the chemical), but Paine steals the symbiote for himself. <b>Brock</b> frees the symbiote, and again becomes Venom.|$|E
5|$|A {{short time}} later <b>Brock</b> {{received}} a report from Fort George {{that some of the}} garrison were planning to imprison the officers and flee to the U.S. Immediately he boarded the schooner that had brought the message and proceeded to Fort George, under the command of then-Lieutenant-Colonel Roger Hale Sheaffe. A hastily assembled honour guard formed to greet Brock's unexpected arrival. Alone on entering the fort, <b>Brock</b> ordered the sergeant of the guard to disarm and had him confined.|$|E
