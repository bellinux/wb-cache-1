25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{exploratory}} dig, and of the earlier investigations, Jones' contract was extended and she was appointed director of the full scale excavations. She was joined by her husband Tom and in 1965 (after the crops had been harvested) they began the mammoth task that was to last for the next 14years on the Mucking hill top. The excavation was unusual in that it continued through the winter, unlike most excavations which only took place in the summer. The need to stay ahead of the gravel extraction sometimes meant softening the frozen ground with a <b>blow</b> <b>torch</b> to enable a find to be lifted in time.|$|E

50|$|On 26 June 1995 {{there was}} a serious fire at the Grand Hotel. The fire started when workmen had been repainting, using <b>blow</b> <b>torches</b> to strip off old paint. The fire spread quickly partly because of hidden roof voids and the tar pitch in the roof. The hotel was {{evacuated}} {{and there were no}} casualties.|$|R
2500|$|A failed rescue {{operation}} {{was carried out}} by the Danish frigate [...] and a Seychellois Coast Guard patrol boat on 26 January. MV Beluga Nomination was taken over four days before and the attackers cut into the freighter's citadel with a <b>blow</b> <b>torch</b> to get at the crew. The Seychelles patrol boat and Esbern Snare were dispatched and when they found the pirates and engagement began. Boarding teams from the patrol boat were repulsed but the Seychellois were able to kill {{one or two of the}} pirates. Two of Beluga Nominations crew managed to escape in a lifeboat and were rescued by the Danish though four others were killed either by drowning or the pirates. Ultimately the operation was aborted and the pirates sailed away with the tanker and seven remaining hostages.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the Torah {{injunction}} {{not to eat}} chametz during Passover (...) , observant families typically own complete sets {{of serving}} dishes, glassware and silverware (and in some cases, even separate dishwashers and sinks) which have never {{come into contact with}} chametz, for use only during Passover. Under certain circumstances, some chametz utensils can be immersed in boiling water (hagalat keilim) to purge them of any traces of chametz that may have accumulated during the year. Many Sephardic families thoroughly wash their year-round glassware and then use it for Passover, as the Sephardic position is that glass does not absorb enough traces of food to present a problem. Similarly, ovens may be used for Passover either by setting the self-cleaning function to the highest degree for a certain period of time, or by applying a <b>blow</b> <b>torch</b> to the interior until the oven glows red hot (a process called libun gamur).|$|E

50|$|In the day {{following}} the accident, the Indian Navy supplied divers, who {{dove into the}} flood waters with <b>blow</b> <b>torches</b> to try to rescue {{people who might have}} been trapped in air pockets in the sunken carriages. Reportedly, several people were rescued this way. The Indian Army and Air Force also provided assistance with rescue, medical and heavy lift helicopters, by collecting bodies and maintaining security at the site.|$|R
50|$|A joint {{between two}} members aligned {{approximately}} {{in the same}} plane. Butt welding can also be achieved through traditional <b>blow</b> <b>torches</b> in {{the most common form}} of butt joints, a process that uses some variety of flux, usually a tin-based solder and precise hand-eye coordination that is common for hand-made boxes of copper, brass, and silver. There are two types of butt welding; one is carried out by smiting and another is carried out by welding two work pieces by non-overlapping.|$|R
50|$|The mixture had the {{consistency}} of a thick paste or putty. It {{was applied to the}} vehicle, usually at the factory, patterned, and then hardened with <b>blow</b> <b>torches.</b> There were many variations seen in application designs, from the regular ridge-shaped pattern, to a less common waffle-shaped pattern. The differences mostly related to the factory producing each type of AFV. For example, the waffle pattern was seen almost exclusively on Sturmgeschütz III assault guns. In general, vehicles already in service were not coated with Zimmerit.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{happened}} {{a good many}} years ago {{at a time when}} I was only a young fellow fresh from college, very proud of my Plumb. B., and inclined to think that I knew it all. I had done a little monograph on Choked Feed in the <b>Blow</b> <b>Torch,</b> which had attracted attention, and I suppose that altogether I was about as conceited a young puppy as one would find in the profession. I should mention that at this time I was not married, but had set up a modest apartment of my own with a consulting-room and a single manservant. Naturally I could not afford the services of a solderist or a gassist and did everything for myself, though Simmons, my man, could at a pinch be utilized to tear down plaster and break furniture." ...|$|E

It mounted the pavement and hit multiple pedestrians, killing three. Witnesses said the van was travelling at high speed. 999 emergency calls were first recorded at 22:07. The van was later found to contain 13 [...] wine bottles containing flammable liquid with rags stuffed in them along with <b>blow</b> <b>torches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|According {{to animal}} welfare groups, {{hundreds}} of thousands of stray and pet dogs are inhumanely slaughtered each year to supply Indonesia's dog meat trade. Other animals sold in the [...] "pet meat" [...] trade include cats, rabbits, bats, rats, pigs, and snakes. Footage of pet meat markets shows dogs being clubbed to death or burned alive with <b>blow</b> <b>torches.</b> Local animal rights groups on Java Island Animal Friends Jogja (AFJ) and Jakarta Animal Aid Network (JAAN) have campaigned {{for the last few years}} to end the dog meat trade in Indonesia.|$|R
50|$|While Polosmak and {{her team}} were {{excavating}} the site and defrosting the artifacts with water from a nearby lake heated with <b>blow</b> <b>torches,</b> rumors circulated among the indigenous Ukok people that disturbing the dead would have dire consequences. The engine of the helicopter that Polosmak used to fly {{the remains of the}} maiden to Russia failed, resulting in an emergency landing and some damage to the Ice Maiden for lack of refrigeration. This was taken as a sign that the maiden did not like being disturbed. An earthquake which occurred in the Altay in September 2003 was also seen as bad fortune linked to disturbing the dead.|$|R

50|$|In 2000, Goldman {{opened his}} own {{business}} called Charm City Cakes. Initially, his cake sales began as he worked {{out of his house}} in Charles Village in Baltimore, Maryland with the help of two assistants he employed. As the requests for his unusual cakes increased, he hired more employees - many of whom did not have any culinary experience as pastry chefs, but were instead experienced painters, architects, and sculptors. Charm City Cakes frequently uses <b>blow</b> <b>torches,</b> as well as power tools such as grinders and drills to help create the underlying supports of cakes. With his crew, Goldman has created unusual cakes including the likenesses of Elvis {{in the form of a}} 3-foot butter cream sculpture, an anatomically correct ear, a smoking volcano, a three-dimensional German Shepherd, as well as a replica of a CAT scan machine, a Jeep, and an edible Wrigley Field.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1980 New Mexico State Penitentiary riot, {{a number}} of inmates were burnt to death by fellow inmates, who used <b>blow</b> <b>torches.</b> Modern burnings {{continued}} {{as a method of}} lynching in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the South. One of the most notorious extrajudicial burnings in modern history occurred in Waco, Texas on 15 May 1916. Jesse Washington, an African-American farmhand, after having been convicted of the rape and subsequent murder of a white woman, was taken by a mob to a bonfire, castrated, doused in coal oil, and hanged by the neck from a chain over the bonfire, slowly burning to death. A postcard from the event still exists, showing a crowd standing next to Washington's charred corpse with the words on the back [...] "This is the barbecue we had last night. My picture is to the left with a cross over it. Your son, Joe". This attracted international condemnation and is remembered as the [...] "Waco Horror".|$|R

60|$|Scattering as {{they reached}} the houses, the torch bearers ran from hut to hut; pausing for a few seconds, at each, till the flame had gained a fair hold.
