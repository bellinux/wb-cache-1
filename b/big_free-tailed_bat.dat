50|$|There are a {{large number}} of species of bats and many are endemic to Haiti. Some of the {{identified}} bat species are: greater bulldog bat, sooty mustached bat, Waterhouse's leaf-nosed bat, Pallas's mastiff bat, Mexican funnel-eared bat, <b>big</b> <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat,</b> Cuban flower bat,Cuban fig-eating bat, Parnell's mustached bat, Brazilian free-tailed bat, Jamaican fruit-eating bat and Cuban fruit-eating bat.|$|E
50|$|There {{has also}} been one {{recorded}} sighting of an evening bat (Nycticeius humeralis) on Pelee Island, Ontario, from 1911, which {{is thought to be}} a stray occurrence.

50|$|The <b>big</b> <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> (Nyctinomops macrotis) is a bat species {{found in}} South, North and Central America. They have a {{wingspan}} of 435 mm {{and an average}} length of 140 mm. This bat frequents rocky or canyon country where it roosts in crevices. This migratory species is a swift, powerful flier, and occasional individuals wander {{as far north as}} Canada. Little is known of mortality and longevity. Breeding probably occurs in midwinter while the species is in warmer latitudes. A single young is born in mid-June to early July. Females form small nursery colonies, and the young do not leave the nursery until they are almost full grown. Moths seem to be the mainstay of their diet, although few data have been collected. This bat emerges late in the evening and forages at high altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{other species}} are {{encountered}} only accidentally, or so rarely in Canadian territory {{that it is}} impossible to tell whether they are permanent resident. Most of these species are cetaceans, some generally poorly known: Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), the dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia sima and K. breviceps), Blainville's and True's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris and M. mirus), the false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), and the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). The <b>big</b> <b>free-tailed</b> and evening <b>bats</b> (respectively Nyctinomops macrotis and Nycticeius humeralis), as well as the New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) are found mostly in areas south of the U.S.-Canada frontier, and occasionally in Canada.|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{epidemiological}} studies have linked many cryptic human rabies {{cases in the}} United States with expo-sure to rabies virus (RV) variants associated with insectivorous bats. In Colorado, bats accounted for 98 % of all reported animal rabies cases between 1977 and 1996. The genetic divergence of RV was investigated in bat and terrestrial animal specimens that were submitted for rabies diagnosis to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), Colorado, USA. RV isolates from animal specimens across the United States were {{also included in the}} analysis. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences, which revealed seven principal clades. RV associated with the colonial big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, an bats of the genus Myotis were found to segregate into two distinct clades (I and IV). Clade I was harbored by E. fus-cus and Myotis species, but was also identified in terrestrial animals such as domestic cats and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis). Clade IV was divided into subclades IVA, IVB, and IVC; IVA was identified in E. fuscus, and Myotis species bats, and also in a fox; subclades IVB and IVC circulated predominantly in E. fuscus. Clade II was formed by <b>big</b> <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> (Nyctinomops macrotis) and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) samples. Clade III included RVs that are maintained by generally solitary, migratory bats such as the silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and bats of the genus Lasiurus. Big brown bats were found to harbor this RV variant. None of the Colorado specimens segregated with clades V and VII that harbor RVs associated with terrestrial animals. Dif-ferent species of bats had the same RV variant, indicating active inter-species rabies transmission. In Colorado, animal rabies occurs principally in bats, and the identification of bat RVs in cat, gray fox Urocyon cinereoargen-teus), and striped skunks demonstrated the importance of rabies spillover from bats to domestic and terrestrial wildlife species.

5|$|The most {{significant}} {{threat to the}} bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> {{is likely to be}} ongoing land clearing in semi-arid bioregions of Queensland and NSW. The eastern Australian Bioregions that comprise the core range of the bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat,</b> particularly the Brigalow Belt (north and south), have been subjected to broad scale clearing and habitat modification since European settlement. Clearing of vegetation for agriculture and removal of hollow bearing trees for firewood collection and forestry are likely to reduce the availability of roosting sites for the bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat.</b> Clearing of native vegetation and removal of dead wood and dead trees have been recognised as key threatening processes for the bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> in NSW.|$|R

50|$|Mexican <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bats</b> are nocturnal foragers {{and begin}} feeding after dusk. They travel 50 km in a quick, direct flight pattern to feed.

50|$|The bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> is {{uncommon}} {{and widely}} dispersed across broad areas of inland Australia, with specimens and records from central Australia and the remote south-western {{corner of the}} Northern Territory, northern South Australia, western and central Queensland and north western NSW. The distribution of the bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> is unusual in that it ranges from extremely arid areas of the central Australian interior, where average annual rainfall is less than abbr=on 200 mm, to areas of the north-eastern Queensland dry tropics where average annual rainfall can exceed abbr=on 1000 mm.

500|$|A 1998 genetic {{study of}} species {{boundaries}} in Australian <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bats</b> (Family Mollossidae) {{indicated that the}} bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> (referred to as Mormopterus sp 6) {{was one of a}} group of eight distinct and unresolved genetic groups in the Australian Mormopterus. Mormopterus sp 6 was genetically distinct from all other types, however only a single specimen from central Australia was included in the study. [...] Accumulation of additional specimens (n=24) in Museum collections and targeted trapping facilitated formal description of the bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> in 2008 on the basis of morphology, the results of allozyme electrophoresis and investigation of echolocation call characteristics. Further resolution of the Australian Molossidae has shown that the bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> and the east-coast <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> (Mormopterus norfolkensis) are only distantly related to other Australian Mollosid taxa, and the differences between these two species and remaining taxa in the Mormopterus 'planiceps group lead to the erection of three new subgenera in 2014. These subgenera include Setirostris (Reardon, McKenzie & Adams 2014) for Mormopterus eleryi, Micronomus (Reardon, McKenzie & Adams 2014) for Mormopterus norfolkensis and Ozimops (Reardon, McKenzie & Adams 2014) for the remaining seven Australian taxa and several Indo-Papuan forms formerly in the planiceps group. The subgeneric name Setirostris (seta + rostrum) refers to the characteristic bristles on the face of the bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> [...] and the specific name eleryi is for Elery Hamilton-Smith in recognition of contributions to bat research and conservation.|$|R
