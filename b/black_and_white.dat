5|$|On August 3, 2010, Masuda {{announced}} on his blog that the <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> <b>White</b> game versions will initially only contain brand-new Pokémon to evoke {{a feeling of}} it being a brand-new game, like when the original Pokémon games were first released. In all of the games following the first generation, there were a series of new Pokémon introduced interspersed with Pokémon from the previous generations. For example, Pikachu was introduced in Red and Green, and was obtainable in Blue, Yellow, and all subsequent main series games; however, Pikachu will not be obtainable in <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> <b>White</b> {{from the start of}} the game. It was later confirmed that <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> <b>White</b> are region locked on the Nintendo DSi and 3DS.|$|E

5|$|The club's main rivals are Hartlepool United. The club's {{traditional}} colours are <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> shirts, black {{shorts and}} <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> socks. The club's crest depicts Locomotion No 1, {{referring to the}} town's railway history; {{as well as a}} stylised Quaker hat, referring to the religious movement that had a historic influence on the town, and which was the source of the team's nickname, the Quakers.|$|E
5|$|The colours {{used by the}} {{original}} Panthers were <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white.</b> Home shirts were black with a <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> striped lining on the shoulders. When the club reformed in 1980, the <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> colours were also revived, with a gold lining also being added to the jerseys. In 1996 red {{was added to the}} colour scheme of the shirts. In 2001–02 the club's colour scheme was changed to black and gold. Home jerseys are gold with a black lining with away jerseys being the reverse. In 2007–08, the Panthers brought out a predominantly white third jersey for the Challenge Cup.|$|E
5|$|The use of <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> is {{regarded}} as dramatic, and although {{it may have been}} influenced by 1940s and 1950s works of Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell, it is more likely a commentary on Mondrian's 1917 Composition in <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> <b>White.</b> Alternatively, {{it may have been a}} reference to another of Mondrian's Pre-World War I <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> oval paintings, such as Pier and ocean, 1915. This complementary source art was common of Lichtenstein's 1960s work on frequently advertised objects. Lichtenstein describes his sources as Mondrian Plus and Minus paintings.|$|E

5|$|Tow Law Town's home colours have {{traditionally}} been vertical <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> stripes with black shorts and socks. This is common amongst clubs in the North East of England; Football League Championship club Newcastle United play in <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white,</b> but locally Spennymoor Town, Darlington, Ponteland United and Ashington also wear <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> kits. Tow Law Town's away strips consist of blue and red halves with blue shorts and socks. Between 2006 and 2009, the club were sponsored by McInerney Homes, in a £5,000 a year deal. In August 2010, local company Bodywork Direct took over the club shirt sponsorship deal.|$|E

5|$|An origin myth {{from the}} Murri people of Queensland, cited by Andrew Lang, {{describes}} how the Australian pelican acquired its <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> plumage. The pelican, formerly a black bird, made a canoe during a flood {{in order to save}} drowning people. He {{fell in love with a}} woman he thus saved, but she and her friends tricked him and escaped. The pelican consequently prepared to go to war against them by daubing himself with white clay as war paint. However, before he had finished, another pelican, on seeing such a strange piebald creature, killed him with its beak, and all such pelicans have been <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> ever since.|$|E

5000|$|In [...] "The Almost Year", Alice Walker {{explains}} how the author Florence Randall {{explains how}} she wants <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> to embrace one another. She clarifies that [...] "she seeks {{to find a}} way in which <b>black</b> abused <b>and</b> poor <b>and</b> <b>white</b> privileged <b>and</b> rich can meet and exchange some warmth of themselves. Walker's perspective is that if both <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> can stop the racial equality that <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> will not be divided. In this house, a black girl feels somewhat threatened being an all-white household. Due to these circumstances, Walker provides a sense of division between the <b>black</b> girl <b>and</b> the family that is providing a home for her to feel free. The black girl cannot embrace the warmth from the Mallory's family because she feels that all white people are to hurt black people. Walker explains how the Civil Rights Movement intended to bring both <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> together. Walker wants to show how a black girl should not have to feel unequal when they are around white people.|$|R
