25|$|On {{arriving}} to the Wind Music Island, Lyra is notified by Tangle {{that the music}} eons in this island were once created by fairies, who also used to live there. Lyra finds his notification confusing, though she gradually understands that fairies are responsible of what have been happening to her: the magical chalkboard, the hidden airship, a stranger's whisper...; and not to mention those five powerful powers that Lyra is granted to use. <b>But</b> <b>still</b> <b>she</b> have known her fairy roots yet, as Tangle keeps it from her. After finding all three keys, Lyra returns to the Clockmaker's house and finishes her mission there. She is able {{to head back to}} her original dimension, also questioning the adventure that she has taken. But instead of welcoming Lyra with sunshine and daylight, her Town of Wish becomes dark and full of thunders. Lyra wonders what will be waiting her next.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} year Miranda made a cameo appearance in Four Jills in a Jeep, a film {{based on a}} true adventure of actresses Kay Francis, Carole Landis, Martha Raye, and Mitzi Mayfair; Alice Faye and Betty Grable also made brief appearances. In 1944 Miranda also starred with Don Ameche in Greenwich Village, a Fox musical with William Bendix and Vivian Blaine in supporting roles. The film was poorly received; according to the New York Times, [...] "Technicolor is the picture's chief asset, but still worth a look for the presence of Carmen Miranda". In her Miami News review, Peggy Simmonds wrote: [...] "Fortunately for Greenwich Village, the picture is made in Technicolor and has Carmen Miranda. Unfortunately for Carmen Miranda, the production doesn't do her justice, the overall effect is disappointing, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>she</b> sparkles the picture whenever she appears." [...] Greenwich Village was less successful at the box office than Fox and Miranda had expected.|$|E

2500|$|The {{children}} were {{asleep in the}} berths, and I was lying awake, listening to the sounds on the boat and wondering which part of the Sound we were on. [...] Suddenly there came a signal shrill whistle from our boat, and I jumped up and looked out of the window. [...] There was a big boat, bearing directly down on us. [...] She blew four times and began to back. [...] <b>But</b> <b>still</b> <b>she</b> came ahead towards us, and I {{could see she was}} going to cut into us. [...] I don't know what I thought or did. [...] I watched her coming on, and it seemed as if she went slowly, but still so fast. [...] Then she ground into us, and I ran to my baby. [...] The boat broke in all the side of the room, and the sound of smashing timbers and glass with the shock of the impact almost made me sick. [...] To add to the confusion, there were the shouts of the officers and the crew. [...] The cries of my little boys and girl. [...] The {{children were}} bruised by the collision, and none of us were able to save any clothing or any other personal belongings.|$|E
