50|$|A common {{occurrence}} of water vapour bubbles is {{observed in a}} <b>pan</b> <b>of</b> boiling water. In that case the water pressure is not reduced, but rather, the vapour pressure of the water is increased by means of heating. If the heat source is sufficient, the bubbles will detach from the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan</b> and rise to the surface as steam. Otherwise if the pan {{is removed from the}} heat the bubbles will be reabsorbed into the water as it cools, possibly causing pitting or spalling on the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan</b> as the bubbles implode.|$|R

50|$|Usually chopped or sliced fruits—such as apples, peaches, pineapples, or cherries—and {{butter and}} sugar are placed on the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan</b> before the batter is poured in, so that they form a baked-on topping after the cake is inverted.|$|R
2500|$|After cooking paella, {{there is}} usually a layer of toasted rice at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan,</b> called socarrat in Spain. This is {{considered}} a delicacy among Spaniards and is essential to a good paella. The toasted rice develops on its own if the paella is cooked over a burner or open fire. If cooked in an oven, however, it will not. To correct this, place the paellera over a high flame while listening to the rice toast at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan.</b> Once the aroma of toasted rice wafts upwards, it is removed [...] from the heat. The paella must then sit {{for about five minutes}} (most recipes recommend the paella be covered with a tea-towel at this point) to absorb the remaining broth.|$|R
50|$|Unsalted {{butter is}} melted {{over low heat}} and allowed to {{separate}} into butterfat and milk solids. The latter naturally sink to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan</b> and, if left over gentle heat, will begin to brown. As they reach a toasty hazelnut color, the pan {{is removed from the}} heat.|$|R
5000|$|When a {{piece of}} meat is roasted, pan-fried, or {{prepared}} in a pan with another form of dry heat, a deposit of browned sugars, carbohydrates, and/or proteins forms on the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan,</b> along with any rendered fat. The French culinary term for these deposits is sucs, [...] ), (or [...] "sook") from the Latin word succus (sap).|$|R
6000|$|... "There she is," [...] he said, [...] "and you-all {{just watch}} my smoke. There's {{millions}} {{here for the}} man who can see them. And I seen all them millions this afternoon when them seven hundred dollars peeped up at me from the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan</b> and chirruped, 'Well, if here ain't Burning Daylight come at last.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|The meat {{is removed}} and the {{majority}} of the fat is poured off, leaving a small amount with the dried and browned meat juices. The pan is returned to the heat, and a liquid such as vegetable or meat stock, a spirit, some wine, or verjuice is added to act as a solvent. Dairy, however, is not recommended for deglazing, as it may curdle when added to high heat. The solvent allows the cook to scrape the dark spots from the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan</b> and dissolve them, incorporating the remaining browned material at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan</b> into a basic sauce.The culinary term fond, French for [...] "base" [...] or [...] "foundation", refers to this sauce, although it is also sometimes used to describe the browned food bits instead (commonly in the United States). Burned pieces {{should not be confused with}} fond, which is dark brown.|$|R
60|$|The girl laughed, {{released}} herself, and sprang up; the pan sank ingloriously to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the pool, where Fleming had to grope for it, {{assisted by}} Tinka, who rolled up her sleeve to her elbow. For {{a minute or}} two they washed gravely, but with no better success than attended his own individual efforts. The result in the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan</b> was the same.

50|$|The {{restaurant}} designed {{an automated}} system to make crepes at a crepe station, {{consisting of a}} motorized conveyor that would heat metal pans. An attendant would dip the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pans</b> in the crepe batter, to ensure an even coating. Lazlo Fono is generally recognized {{as the man who}} invented the crepe-making machine used in the chain's restaurants, starting in the mid-1960s.|$|R

5000|$|A third method, {{invented in}} 1970 for Celestron by Tom Johnson and John O'rourke, uses a vacuum pan {{with the correct}} shape of the curve pre-shaped into the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan,</b> called a [...] "master block". This removes {{the need to have}} to hold a shape by {{applying}} an exact vacuum and allows for the mass production of corrector plates of the same exact shape.|$|R
50|$|Steak au poivre {{is often}} served with pan peppercorn sauce {{consisting}} of reduced cognac, heavy cream, and the fond from the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan,</b> often including other ingredients such as butter, shallots, and/or Dijon mustard. Common side dishes to steak au poivre are {{various forms of}} mashed potatoes and pommes frites (small fried shoestring potatoes).

50|$|Gold panning is {{a simple}} process. Once a {{suitable}} placer deposit is located, some alluvial deposit are scooped into a pan, where it is then gently agitated in water and the gold sinks to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan.</b> Materials with a low specific gravity are allowed to spill out <b>of</b> the <b>pan,</b> whereas materials with a higher specific gravity sink to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the sediment during agitation and remain within the pan for examination and collection by the prospector. These dense materials usually consist primarily of a black, magnetite sand with whatever stones or metal dust that {{may be found in}} the deposit that is used for source material.|$|R
50|$|Pans are {{manufactured}} in both metal and high-impact plastic. Russia iron or {{heavy gauge steel}} pans are traditional. Steel pans are heavier and stronger than plastic pans. Some are made of lightweight alloys for structural stability. Plastic gold pans resist rust, acid and corrosion, and most are designed with moulded riffles along one side <b>of</b> the <b>pan.</b> <b>Of</b> the plastic gold pans, green and red ones are usually preferred among prospectors, as both the gold and the black sand stands out in the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan,</b> although many also opt for black pans instead to easily identify gold deposits.|$|R
50|$|Deglazing {{can also}} be used while cooking vegetables, {{especially}} ones which have left sugars at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> a <b>pan.</b> It is commonly used in caramelizing onions. Because vegetables do not produce as much fat, they {{do not need to be}} removed from the pan to pour off excess grease. Instead, the liquid can be added directly to the pan and stirred, allowing the fond to meld with the vegetables, rather than creating a separate sauce.|$|R
50|$|Thanksgiving is {{approaching}} in Bear Country. The Bear Family attempt to discern their fortunes {{by reading the}} harvest honeycomb when an ominous footprint appears in the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan.</b> Mama interprets this {{as a sign that}} the Thanksgiving Legend of Bigpaw is coming to pass. According to Mama, that if the bears became selfish and greedy and do not share in the bounties of nature, Bigpaw will come destroy Bear Country. Papa believes the story to be nonsense.|$|R
5000|$|Lamp {{black was}} used as a pigment for {{painting}} and frescoes. as a dye for fabrics, and in some societies for making tattoos. The 15th century Florentine painter Cennino Cennini described how it was made during the Renaissance: [...] "... take a lamp full of linseed oil and fill the lamp with the oil and light the lamp. Then place it, lit, under a thoroughly clean pan and make sure that the flame from the lamp is two or three fingers from the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan.</b> The smoke that comes off the flame will hit the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan</b> and gather, becoming thick. Wait a bit. take the pan and brush this pigment (that is, this smoke) onto paper or into a pot with something. And {{it is not necessary to}} mull or grind it because it is a very fine pigment. Re-fill the lamp with the oil and put it under the pan like this several times and, in this way, make as much of it as is necessary." [...] This same pigment was used by Indian artists to paint the Ajanta Caves, and as dye in ancient Japan.|$|R

50|$|There are {{numerous}} gem mines located around the area, especially in paddy fields on lower ground. The mines are generally around 10 m to 50 m deep. Portable hand operating tools {{used for the}} mining process, include shovels, picks, pans (specially made from bamboo) and cradles. Once the soil is extracted from the mine, water is used to wash the dirt and mud away using pans and any gemstones, which heavier than normal stones, will remain at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{basic concept}} of {{retrieving}} gold via placer mining {{has not changed}} since antiquity. The concept is that the gold in sand or soil will settle to the bottom because gold is heavy/dense, and dirt, sand and rock will wash away, leaving the gold behind. The original methods to perform placer mining involved gold panning, sluice boxes, and rockers. Each method involves washing sand, gravel and dirt in water. Gold then settles to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan,</b> or into the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the riffles of the sluice box. The gold dredge is the same concept but on a much larger scale.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{technique to}} extract gold from placer ore is panning. In panning, some mined ore {{is placed in}} a large metal or plastic pan, combined with a generous amount of water, and agitated so that the gold particles, being of higher density than the other material, settle to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan.</b> The lighter gangue material such as sand, mud and gravel are then washed over the side <b>of</b> the <b>pan,</b> leaving the gold behind. Once a placer deposit is located by gold panning, the miner usually shifts to equipment that can treat volumes of sand and gravel more quickly and efficiently.|$|R
50|$|Gold panning {{is mostly}} a manual {{technique}} of separating gold from other materials. Wide, shallow pans are filled with sand and gravel that may contain gold. The pan is submerged in water and shaken, sorting the gold from the gravel and other material. As gold is much denser than rock, it quickly settles to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan.</b> The panning material is usually removed from stream beds, often at the inside turn in the stream, or from the bedrock shelf of the stream, where the density of gold allows it to concentrate, a type called placer deposits.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was an avid}} {{collector}} of old book and manuscripts, but often careless. After much drinking and attempting to [...] "muddle" [...] Humfrey Wanley, he sold in July 1720 to the Earl of Oxford many valuable manuscripts on Wanley's own terms. On another occasion, he left a pile of drama manuscripts in the kitchen. When he came looking for them a year later, nearly all were gone. His cook, Betsy Baker, had used over fifty manuscripts as scrap paper while cooking - either for lighting fires or for lining the <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> pie <b>pans</b> while baking pies.|$|R
6000|$|However, I {{was not a}} goldseeker, {{and when}} I {{determined}} to give up any further pursuit of mining and to delegate it entirely to my partner, I experienced a feeling of relief. I determined to [...] "stick to my last," [...] notwithstanding the fascination which I felt {{in the sight of}} placer gold. Quartz mining has never had the slightest attraction for me, but to see the gold washed out of the sand, to see it appear bright and shining in the black sand in the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan,</b> is really worth while. It is first-hand contact with Nature's stores of wealth.|$|R
6000|$|Each pan {{he carried}} {{down to the}} water to wash, and as he went higher up the hill the pans grew richer, until he began to save the gold in an empty baking powder can which he carried {{carelessly}} in his hip-pocket. So engrossed was he in his toil that he did not notice the long twilight of oncoming night. It was not until he tried vainly to see the gold colors in the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan</b> that he realized the passage of time. He straightened up abruptly. An expression of whimsical wonderment and awe overspread his face as he drawled: ...|$|R
60|$|They {{came upon}} {{a man in the}} bend of the creek, white of skin and blue of eye, and for a moment Li Wan saw the other man in the snow. But she saw dimly, for she was weak and tired from what she had undergone. Still, she looked at him curiously, and stopped with Canim to watch him at his work. He was washing gravel in a large pan, with a circular, tilting movement; and as they looked, giving a deft flirt, he flashed up the yellow gold in a broad streak across the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan.</b>|$|R
50|$|In pan frying, {{the water}} that exits the meat forms a barrier between the meat and the oil or the surface <b>of</b> the <b>pan.</b> This barrier is {{critical}} for the success <b>of</b> <b>pan</b> frying meat. When meat cooks, the proteins {{on the surface of}} the meat denature because of the heat. This means that many of the secondary bonds that give the proteins their shape are broken. The protein molecules want to reform those interactions to return to their most thermodynamically stable state. Two opportune locations for the surface proteins to bind are the oil and the surface <b>of</b> the <b>pan.</b> Meat sticking to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan</b> is caused by the interactions between proteins {{on the surface of the}} meat binding with the molecules on the surface <b>of</b> the <b>pan.</b> The denatured protein can also bind with the oil in the pan. This is not desirable for many health and flavor reasons. Since the proteins, the oil molecules, and in some cases the surface <b>of</b> the <b>pan,</b> all have a significant polarity, the force of their interactions can be high.|$|R
60|$|The washing had {{now become}} very fine--fine beyond all need of {{ordinary}} placer-mining. He worked the black sand, {{a small portion}} at a time, up the shallow rim <b>of</b> the <b>pan.</b> Each small portion he examined sharply, so that his eyes saw every grain of it before he allowed it to slide over the edge and away. Jealously, bit by bit, he let the black sand slip away. A golden speck, {{no larger than a}} pin-point, appeared on the rim, and by his manipulation of the riveter it returned to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pan.</b> And in such fashion another speck was disclosed, and another. Great was his care of them. Like a shepherd he herded his flock of golden specks so that not one should be lost. At last, <b>of</b> the <b>pan</b> <b>of</b> dirt nothing remained but his golden herd. He counted it, and then, after all his labor, sent it flying out <b>of</b> the <b>pan</b> with one final swirl of water.|$|R
