60|$|But {{they did}} not succeed. They were {{received}} so hotly by the Russians that, after an obstinate contest, {{they were forced to}} retreat. They endeavored to get back to their boats, but were pursued by the Russians; and now, as their <b>backs</b> <b>were</b> turned, they could no longer defend themselves, and a great many were killed. Even those that were not killed did not all succeed in making their escape. A considerable number, finding that they should {{not be able to get}} to the boats, threw down their arms, and surrendered themselves prisoners; and then, of course, the boats which they belonged to were taken. Five of the boats thus fell into the hands of the Russians. The others <b>were</b> rowed <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> speed to the ships, and then the ships withdrew. Thus the attempt failed entirely.

50|$|Nikkasaurus is an extinct genus of therapsid.They {{were small}} animals, with skulls about 5 cm long. Their eyes had large orbits and {{sclerotic}} rings. The head <b>was</b> tilted <b>back,</b> as <b>with</b> <b>all</b> therapsids. The skull looks superficially {{similar to those}} of the Pelycosaurs, in particular Varanopidae. Nikkasaurus was probably mainly insectivorous, and possibly nocturnal.The only known species is N. tatarinovi, described by MF Ivahnenko in 2000, from the Middle Permian Mezen River Basin. The family Nikkasauridae also includes the Reiszia genus with two species (R. gubini and R. tippula) described by Ivahnenko in 2000 from the same sediment. Nikkasaurus is possibly a relic of a more ancient stage of therapsid development.|$|R
5000|$|While Decipher {{oversaw the}} game, no card was ever banned from tournament play. Instead, when a card or {{strategy}} was deemed abusive or too powerful, Decipher chose to release [...] "magic bullets," [...] new cards which were {{specifically designed to}} counter the offending strategy. In some cases, Decipher also used errata, modifications to game text of a card that supersede the actual printed version. The use of errata also contributes to a steep learning curve, since players {{need to be aware}} of the current meta-game at all times. Finally, the game was known for its quirky humor and inside jokes: one card, depicting Luke's protracted hand-stand during The Empire Strikes <b>Back,</b> <b>was</b> printed <b>with</b> <b>all</b> text upside-down. Another described a character as being Boba Fett's twin brother, since the same actor (Jeremy Bulloch) played both roles.|$|R

6000|$|Dingarn {{proved to}} be at Congella, another {{circular}} town or kraal, {{on the top of}} a hill. He gave a ready welcome to the Captain, and his presents--some looking-glasses, a pair of epaulettes, and some coloured prints, especially full-lengths of George IV. and William IV. The collection in a place such as Natal then was must have been very hard to make, but it was very successful, and still more so was the Captain's presenting himself in his uniform when he went to propose the treaty. Dingarn said he must look at it before he could do anything else, and fully appreciated the compliment when the sailor said it was his war dress, in which he appeared before King William. He agreed to the treaty, but declared that the English would be the first to break it. The Captain answered that a true Englishman never broke a treaty, and that any white man who deceived was not the right sort of Englishman; and the king responded that [...] "now a great chief was come, to whom he could speak his heart." [...] Captain Gardiner tried to impress on him that it was the fear of God that made himself an honourable man, and to persuade him that the knowledge of the [...] "Book" [...] would make him and his people still greater; and the next time of meeting set forth an outline of the morality and promises of Revelation. Dingarn was attentive, and said they were good words, and that he would hear more of them, but in the meantime Gardiner must go back to Natal and see that his people kept the treaty. It was a good deal more than he could do. A Kaffir inkosikase, or female chieftain, who, with two servants and three children, was fleeing into Natal at the time of his return, <b>was</b> sent <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> her companions. The poor creatures pleaded hard that the Captain would accompany them and save them, and he returned with them, and interceded for them <b>with</b> <b>all</b> his might, but soon found they were being starved to death. [...] "Their bonds must kill them," [...] said Dingarn. A second great effort resulted in a little food being sent, and a kind of promise that their lives should be spared; but this was only made to get rid of him, and they all perished after his departure.|$|R
60|$|My dearest Sarianna,--You {{will like}} to hear, if {{only by a}} scratch, that we <b>are</b> <b>back</b> in Tuscany <b>with</b> <b>all</b> safety, after a very {{pleasant}} journey through an almost absolute solitude. Florence is perfectly tranquil {{and at the same}} time most unusually animated, what with the French troops and the passionate gratitude of the people. We have two great flags on our terrace, the French flag and the Italian, and Peni keeps a moveable little flag between them, which (as he says) 'he can take out in the carriage sometimes.' Pen is enchanted with the state of things in general, and the French camp in particular, which he came home from only in the dusk last night, having 'enjoyed himself so very much in seeing those dear French soldiers play at blindman's buff.' They won't, however, remain long here, unless the Austrians threaten to come down on us, which, I trust, they will be too much absorbed to do. The melancholy point in all this is the dirt eaten and digested with a calm face by England and the English. Now that I have exhausted myself with indignation and protestation, Robert has taken up the same note, which is a comfort. I would rather hear my own heart in his voice. Certainly it must be still more bitter for him than for me, seeing that he has more national predilections than I have, and has struggled longer to see differently. Not only the prestige, but the very respectability of England is utterly lost here--and nothing less is expected than her ultimate and open siding with Austria in the war. If she does, we shall wash our hands like so many Pilates, which will save us but not England.|$|R

6000|$|But {{what was}} he to do? At the outset of his pecuniary troubles, when he first found it {{necessary}} to litigate some question with the De Courcy people, and withstand the web which Mortimer Gazebee wove so assiduously, his own attorney had introduced him to Dobbs Broughton, and the assistance which he had needed had come to him, at any rate, without trouble. He did not especially like Mr. Broughton; and when Mr. Broughton first invited him to come and eat a little bit of dinner, he had told himself with painful remorse that in his early days he had been accustomed to eat his little bits of dinner with people of a different kind. But there had been nothing really painful in this. Since his marriage with a daughter of the De Courcys,--by which marriage he had intended to climb to the highest pinnacle of social eating and drinking,--he had gradually found himself to be falling in the scale of such matters, and could bring himself to dine with a Dobbs Broughton without any violent pain. But now he had fallen so low that Dobbs Broughton had insulted him, and he was in such distress {{that he did not know}} where to turn for ten pounds. Mr. Gazebee had beaten him at litigation, and his own lawyer had advised him that it would be foolish to try the matter further. In his marriage with the noble daughter of the De Courcys he had allowed the framers of the De Courcy settlement to tie him up in such a way that now, even when chance had done so much for him in freeing him from his wife, he was still bound to the De Courcy faction. Money had been paid away,--on his behalf, as alleged by Mr. Gazebee,--like running water; money for furniture, money for the lease of a house, money when he had been separated from his wife, money while she was living abroad. It had seemed to him that he had been made to pay for the entire support of the female moiety of the De Courcy family which had settled itself at Baden-Baden, from the day, and in some respects from before the day, on which his wife had joined that moiety. He had done all in his power to struggle against these payments, but every such struggle had only cost him more money. Mr. Gazebee had written to him the civilest notes; but every note seemed to cost him money,--every word of each note seemed to find its way into some bill. His wife had died and her body had <b>been</b> brought <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the pomp befitting the body of an earl's daughter, that it might be laid with the old De Courcy dust,--at his expense. The embalming of her dear remains had cost a wondrous sum, and was a terrible blow upon him. All these items were showered upon him by Mr. Gazebee with the most courteously worded demands for settlement as soon as convenient. And then, when he applied that Lady Alexandrina's small fortune should be made over to him,--according to a certain agreement under which he had made over all his possessions to his wife, should she have survived him,--Mr. Gazebee expressed a mild opinion that he was wrong in his law, and blandly recommended an amicable lawsuit. The amicable lawsuit was carried on. His own lawyer seemed to throw him over. Mr. Gazebee was successful in everything. No money came to him. Money was demanded from him on old scores and on new scores,--and all that he received to console him for what he had lost was a mourning ring with his wife's hair,--for which, with sundry other mourning rings, he had to pay,--and an introduction to Mr. Dobbs Broughton. To Mr. Dobbs Broughton he owed five hundred pounds; and as regarded a bill for the one-half of that sum which was due to-morrow, Mr. Dobbs Broughton had refused to grant him renewal for a single month! ...|$|R
