30|$|In Germany, {{industrial}} relations {{used to be}} dominated by collective <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> between industry wide unions and employers’ associations. This system has become less stable, mainly due to increasing competition from “outsiders”—firms and unions outside the industry-wide agreement. Recent developments such as firm’s abandonment of collective <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> (“Tarifflucht”) or increasing competition between (or plurality of) different <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> (“Tarifkonkurrenz” or “Tarifpluralität”) have become important topics in the ongoing debate on the future of German labour market institutions. This development is reflected by changes to laws and new fields of government action. For instance, minimum wage laws have recently been introduced for some sectors, and the Law on Collective <b>Wage</b> <b>Agreements</b> (“Tarifvertragsgesetz”) has been amended.|$|R

40|$|An {{advantage}} of collective <b>wage</b> <b>agreement</b> is that search and business-stealing externalities can be internalized.

Theoretically wage rigidities can result from contracts, implicit contracts, from efficiency wages and from insider-outsider behaviour.

Collective <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> and implicit contracts are important reasons for wage rigidities for the low skilled.

30|$|Finally, {{the third}} type of {{variable}} refers to sectoral wage-bargaining practises, i.e. the coverage by collective <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> at the sector or firm level. For Europe {{in general and}} Belgium in particular, this provides a much better indicator of union bargaining power than union membership, for example. The reason is that, unlike in the US, <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> are negotiated between employers’ representatives and workers’ representatives, but apply to all workers, {{regardless of whether they}} are unionised or not. As explained above, sector-level agreements apply generally in Belgium. As an indicator of decentralised wage setting, we calculate the average proportion over time (1999 – 2002) of workers covered by a firm-level <b>wage</b> <b>agreement,</b> from the SES dataset.

30|$|The {{question}} {{on the level of}} collective <b>wage</b> <b>agreement</b> was posed differently in the Slovenia survey from that in the WDN survey in other countries and had a major shortcoming. In other countries, the survey included two questions on this issue: if the firm applied a collective <b>wage</b> <b>agreement</b> set outside the firm and, irrespective of the answer to this question, if the firm applied a <b>wage</b> <b>agreement</b> signed at the firm level. Thus, these surveys could capture collective agreements being applied at more than one level. In contrast, the Slovenia survey only asked which level of collective bargaining agreement was applied by the firm, and did not provide the option of recording multiple answers. Thus, the survey did not capture the application of more than one level of agreement that we know from Section 2 was a standard feature of the Slovene system.

Using establishment data from the German employment statistics, the paper demonstrates that the divergence between <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> and effective <b>wages</b> is probably not a consequence of a massive escape from collective <b>wage</b> <b>agreements,</b> or the intense use of opt-out clauses in such agreements in East Germany.

Collective <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> in Austria generally remain valid for one year and are staggered; the highest concentrations of new agreements {{can be found in}} the months of January, May and November each year. The relevant literature describes Austrian wage bargaining as a system of wage leadership, with the agreement reached by the metal workers, which usually goes into effect in early November of each year, setting a precedent for <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> reached by other sectors in the ensuing months. Through an analysis of detailed individual series from the Index of Agreed Minimum Wages, it is actually possible to provide empirical evidence for the existence of wage leadership. The results also show that the wage-leading metal sector is substantially more sensitive to macroeconomic forecasts than the other sectors are. This phenomenon and the rapid transmission to the sectors that follow are probably key reasons why empirical evidence of high real wage flexibility has been found in Austria. staggered wage contracts, wage leadership, collective <b>wage</b> <b>agreements,</b> Austria...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} whether {{wages in}} Germany respond to firm-specific profitability conditions. Particular emphasis {{lies on the}} question of whether the extent of rent-sharing varies across different systems of wage determination. Those may be categorised into sector-specific <b>wage</b> <b>agreements,</b> firm-specific <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> and <b>wage</b> determination without any bargaining coverage. To derive testable hypotheses, we set up a theoretical model that analyses the sensitivity of wages to firm-specific conditions under different wage setting structures. The hypotheses are tested using an establishment-level panel data set from the mining and manufacturing sector. The results of the empirical analysis generally suggest that rent-sharing is present in Germany. However, the extent of rent-sharing is found to be significantly lower in establishments that are subject to a collective <b>wage</b> <b>agreement</b> - irrespective of whether the agreement is industry- or firm-specific. While pooled OLS estimates yield positive estimates of the rent-sharing coefficient in establishments that are covered by a collective contract, SYS-GMM-estimates accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity of rents point to a rent-sharing coe cient of zero...|$|R

40|$|Material Abstract This thesis reconsiders the 3 rd century A.

D. 235 and 305. The importance of this research {{is that this is a}} period that is typically described as a time of crisis and inflation. This research therefore explores how private <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> and rates responded to the debasement of the Alexandrian tetradrachm between A. D. 235 and the reforms of Aurelian in 274 / 5; it then examines private viticulture-labour and general labour agreements to determine how <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> responded to the reforms of Aurelian in A. D. 274 / 5, and the changes to currency that occurred between A. D. 274 / 5 and A. D. 299. Private labour agreements between A. D. 300 and 305 are then examined {{to determine if there}} is any evidence for inflation, and to establish how wages responded to the A. D. Edict of Maximum Prices. Finally the research examines wheat prices between A. D. 235 and 305 to determine how these prices responded to the changes in the currency and the buying power of labourer wages during the study period. 	The results will demonstrate that between A. D. 235 and A. D. 274 / 5 private <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> did not increase in response to the debasement of the Alexandrian tetradrachm. They will also demonstrate that between A. D. 274 / 5 and A. D. 299 the reforms of Aurelian saw a doubling in value of the tetradrachm, and that wages remained stable reflecting this doubling until c. A. D 286. The results will then show that the introduction of the nummus saw the continued use of older debased tetradrachms, and that this necessitated the upward revaluation of the nummus to ensure its use as a replacement to the tetradrachm. Moreover the revaluation reduced the number of nummi paid in <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> to mid 3 rd century rates both in terms of the coins, and the amount of silver exchanged. Finally the research will demonstrate that wheat prices per artaba reflected the revaluation of the currency, and not inflation; and that prices remained stable until A. D. 305...|$|R
