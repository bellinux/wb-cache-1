It could be {{installed}} on much smaller ships than the much larger and longer-ranged RIM-8 Talos. A Terrier installation typically consisted of the Mk 10 twin-arm launcher with a 40-round rear-loading magazine, but some ships had extended magazines with 60 or 80 rounds, and the installation in Boston and Canberra used a <b>bottom-loading</b> magazine of 72 rounds.|$|E

The manual states that Twisted! is not compatible with the Game Boy Player; although the game loads as normal, players would have to carry and tilt the connected GameCube console and use its controller for button presses, thus {{it is simply not}} practical.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the bulk crystallization of 54 B 2 O 3 - 19 SiO 2 - 17 Al 2 O 3 - 5 BaO- 5 MgO (mol%) glass. Melting was carried out at 1500 °C for 1 h using a <b>bottom-load</b> electric furnace. The glass melt was cast into a block and annealed at 500 °C for 2 h. Isothermal heat treatment was carried out at 1100 °C for 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 h to form bulk crystallized glass-ceramics using a heating and cooling rate of 5 °C/min. Phases present in the glass-ceramic samples were studied by x-ray diffraction. Crystalline Al 4 B 2 O 9 and Al 18 B 4 O 33 were the main phases and the phase stability depended on the isothermal time. Microstructures were observed by a scanning electron microscope. The size of aluminum borate whiskers/rods tend to increase with longer isothermal holding period. The whisker/ rod-like crystals uniformly oriented throughout the microstructure in all heat treated samples. This led to interlocking microstructure and hence an increase in hardness and fracture toughness. Glass-ceramics synthesized at longer heat treatment times resulted {{in an increase in}} the surface hardness and shorter path length {{at the corner of the}} diamond pyramid-shaped indenter. Glass-ceramics synthesized in this study can be applied as high temperature resistant machinable materials because their microstructures can resist micro-cracking upon indentation...|$|R
50|$|The 870 {{features}} a <b>bottom-loading,</b> side ejecting receiver, tubular magazine under the barrel, dual action bars, internal hammer, and a bolt which locks into an extension in the barrel. The action, receiver, fire control group, safety catch and slide release catch of the Remington Model 870 shotgun {{are similar to}} those used on the Remington Model 7600 series pump-action centerfire rifles and carbines. The basic fire control group design was first used in the automatic 11-48. Twelve gauge stocks will also interchange on the older 12-gauge-sized 20-gauge receivers, although modification is needed to fit the smaller sized 20-gauge receivers employed since the late 1970s. Several parts of the 870 will interchange with the semi-automatic Remington 1100 and 11-87.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the construction and}} performance of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) capable of taking maps of the tunneling density of states with sub-atomic spatial resolution at dilution refrigerator temperatures and high (14 T) magnetic fields. The fully ultra-high vacuum system features visual access to a two-sample microscope stage {{at the end of}} a <b>bottom-loading</b> dilution refrigerator, which facilitates the transfer of in situ prepared tips and samples. The two-sample stage enables location of the best area of the sample under study and extends the experiment lifetime. The successful thermal anchoring of the microscope, described in detail, is confirmed through a base temperature reading of 20 mK, along with a measured electron temperature of 250 mK. Atomically-resolved images, along with complementary vibration measurements, are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the vibration isolation scheme in this instrument. Finally, we demonstrate that the microscope is capable of the same level of performance as typical machines with more modest refrigeration by measuring spectroscopic maps at base temperature both at zero field and in an applied magnetic field.

40|$|Rat {{pancreatic}} islet yields obtained with dextran gradient purification were compared after suspending the digest into either the top or the bottom {{layer of the}} gradient. A 5 -layer discontinuous gradient was used, which consisted of 16 ml 31 % dextran as bottom layer, overlayered with 25 %, 23 %, 20 % and 11 % dextran (4 ml each). When the digest of 1 rat pancreas was suspended into {{the top layer of}} the gradient, the total number of islets obtained from the 11 - 20, 20 - 23 and 23 - 25 % interfaces was 862 +/- 38, 240 +/- 39 and 54 +/- 5, respectively. From this gradient, also 1409 +/- 81 islets were retrieved from the bottom layer (i. e., exocrine pellet). In contrast, when the pancreas digest was suspended into the bottom layer of the gradient, 1964 +/- 63, 435 +/- 42, and 177 +/- 34 islets were obtained from the successive interfaces, and only 50 + 20 islets from the exocrine pellet. The total islet volume obtained from the two uppermost interfaces was 3. 46 +/- 0. 31 mul after top-loading, and 4. 93 +/- 0. 16 mul after <b>bottom-loading</b> (n = 7, p < 0. 01). When the islets retrieved from one bottom loaded gradient were transplanted into either 1 (n = 6) or 2 (n = 9) diabetic recipients, glucose levels normalized in all instances. We therefore conclude that a bottom-loaded dextran gradient separates islets from exocrine tissue effectively, resulting in significantly higher islet yields than obtained with a top-loaded dextran gradient...|$|E

[...] According to The Toronto Star, [...] "White's bent Americana and Benson's British invasion-isms yields wonderfully unpredictable results". Kitty Empire of The Observer called the album [...] "lively" [...] and said it [...] "finds Raconteurs luxuriating in fancy stuff with kid-in-a-sweetshop enthusiasm. Minimalism is out, bombast is in; the detail, is, as ever, lip-smacking." [...] Commenting on the band's chemistry and freeness, Rolling Stone said the album is [...] "a blissfully stoned conversation between White and Benson about their favorite bands: Led Zeppelin, the Who, Badfinger", though it added, [...] "that freedom is not always satisfying." [...] Austin-American Statesmen said [...] "it's a weirdly overblown and curiously dull album," [...] and complained about its production. [...] The New York Times echoed those statements about the [...] "chaos" [...] of the album, but concluded that [...] "that desperation only makes the crunch of the music more euphoric." [...] The Guardian found that on Consolers of the Lonely, the Raconteurs [...] "establish a firm, emotionally charged identity of their own" [...] and called the effort [...] "flawed but ragged glory."

40|$|Relationships were {{developed}} to predict ammonia (NH 3) nitrogen losses from cattle manure in animal housing, during manure storage, following field application, and during grazing. Ammonia loss in each phase was predicted using a mechanistic model for NH 3 volatilized {{from the surface of}} an aqueous solution of ammonium where the NH 3 is transported to the free atmosphere through a pathway with finite resistance. Ammonia emission rate was a function of the ammoniacal N content in the manure, ambient temperature, manure pH, manure moisture content, and the exposed manure surface area. Model relationships were calibrated by selecting values for the resistance to NH 3 transport for the various loss pathways, which predicted daily and annual emissions similar to those reported in published studies. In further evaluation, these calibrated relationships predicted average annual losses similar to those documented in previous work over a range in climate locations. These relationships were integrated into a whole-farm simulation model to provide a tool for evaluating and comparing long-term nitrogen losses along with other performance, environmental, and economic aspects of farm production. Whole-farm simulations illustrated that the use of a free stall barn, <b>bottom-loaded</b> slurry storage, and direct injection of manure into the soil reduced NH 3 emissions by 33 % to 50 % compared to other commonly used dairy housing and manure handling systems in the northeastern U. S. The improvement in nitrogen utilization more than offset the increased cost in manure handling, providing a small increase in farm profit. The farm model provides a research and teaching tool for evaluating and comparing the economic and environmental sustainability of dairy and beef production systems...|$|R
40|$|The Platreef {{occurs at}} the base of the Northern Limb of the Bushveld Complex and is variably mineralised with PGE, Cu, and Ni. The Platreef varies in {{thickness}} from a few meters to a few hundred meters and rests on progressively older sediments of the Transvaal Supergroup and Archaean granite basement northwards. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of magmatic processes, contamination of the magma by footwall rocks and syn- and post metasomatic fluid activity on the observed mineralisation. Along the Platreef strike, the PGE grade profiles are generally top-loaded from Overysel to Tweefontein North and more variable and bottom loaded from Tweefontein Hill southwards emphasizing the importance of the change in mineralisation style at Tweefontein in relation to the whole Platreef. This study presents the first significant PGM data on the Tweefontein farm, including ten boreholes along strike, providing insight into the distinctly different PGE mineralisation styles observed. Samples were selected based on assay data, varying rock types, stratigraphic position and proximity to geological features. The selected samples were investigated using petrography, geochemistry and the automated SEM techniques of QEMSCAN and MLA. Over 9000 PGM were analysed forming one of the most comprehensive PGM studies on the Platreef to date. The lowermost footwall intersected along the Tweefontein strike is banded ironstone of the Penge Formation. This is overlain by a metasedimentary footwall package, of variable thickness, derived from the shales and dolomites of the Duitschland Formation. Iron-rich, recrystallised, noritic sills occur {{at the base of}} the Platreef and are thought to represent sills which intruded prior to the emplacement of the Platreef. A pre- and possibly syn-Bushveld structural control resulted in irregular floor topography defined by a topographic footwall high in the central Tweefontein area and topographic depressions at Tweefontein North and Tweefontein Hill. The depression areas at Tweefontein are similar to the footwall basins at Turfspruit to the south, in which the Platreef is more lithologically complex compared to the footwall high areas. The footwall basins at Tweefontein and Turfspruit contain basal massive and submassive sulphides, which may not necessarily carry significant PGE grade. The Platreef lithologies at Tweefontein are composed of pyroxenites and norites with minor harzburgitic lithologies and contain numerous cross-cutting granitic veins. Xenoliths/interlayers of metamorphosed Duitschland lithologies occur primarily near the base of the Platreef, but also in the middle and upper Platreef sequence reflecting roof pendants. Unlike the Platreef on the farms adjacent to Tweefontein, the Platreef and footwall lithologies are relatively unaltered, but localised serpentinisation and chloritisation occur within harzburgitic lithologies and metasedimentary interlayers. Based on the stratigraphy and geochemical characteristics, the Platreef at Tweefontein can be subdivided into the upper and lower Platreef. The upper Platreef subdivision occurs in the top 20 - 40 m of the sequence and is defined by higher Mg#, Cr, Cr (ppm) /MgO and Pt/Pd values compared to the lower Platreef. In addition, the majority of the grade and base metal sulphide (BMS) content is enriched in the upper versus the lower Platreef, particularly for the northern and central parts of Tweefontein. The upper and lower Platreef may have been derived from different magma sources based on the “R Factor” concept proposed by Campbell and Naldrett in 1979 whereby the abundance of the PGE relative to the BMS content is linked to the proportion of magma with which the sulphide ore equilibrated (Naldrett, 2005 b). Previous detailed geochemical studies from Tweefontein Hill southwards highlighted compositional breaks in the Platreef sequence thought to represent distinct sill-like intrusions (Hutchinson and Kinnaird, 2005; Kinnaird, 2005; Manyeruke et al., 2005; Nyama et al., 2006). They reported a more primitive sill at the top of the Platreef, which correlates to the upper Platreef at Tweefontein. The lower Platreef is therefore likely to represent a different sill intrusion. A relatively homogenous pyroxenitic package characterises the upper Platreef, although a more heterogeneous package is observed close to and at Tweefontein Hill. At Tweefontein North, the base of the upper Platreef is often marked by a chromitiferous package comprising a pegmatoidal feldspathic pyroxenite unit, up to 6 m thick, capped by a chromitite layer. Due to similar stratigraphy and high PGE grades, this distinct horizon has been compared to the Merensky Reef found elsewhere in the Bushveld Complex. The predominant base metal sulphides (BMS) in the Platreef at Tweefontein are pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite with minor pyrite aligned with that found elsewhere along the Platreef strike. There is an increase in BMS content, primarily pyrrhotite, towards the base of the Platreef with massive and submassive sulphide development near the base and in the footwall, particularly at Tweefontein Hill. Sulphur isotopes and detailed mineralogical studies at Turfspruit have shown that the addition of S, As and Sb into the magma from the Duitschland footwall triggered the development of a PGE-poor sulphide liquid which was then able to mix, modify and dilute the magmatic sulphides (Hutchinson and McDonald, 2008). Due to the similarity in footwall between Turfspruit and Tweefontein, these proposed processes help to explain the increase in BMS towards the base and the development of basal massive and submassive sulphides, which are not necessarily associated with significant PGE grade. At Tweefontein North, the processes dominating the top-loaded PGE mineralisation were primarily magmatic. The PGM assemblage, hosted by base metal sulphides and magmatic silicates, is dominated by Pt-and Pd-bismuthides and -tellurides with minor PGE-sulphides and Pt-arsenides. PGE-sulphides occur in the Platreef where the chromitiferous horizon is developed, which may indicate an environment low in volatile activity and one of the most primary mineralisation styles along the Platreef strike. The footwall high, which separates the depressions at Tweefontein North and Tweefontein Hill may have kept the Platreef at Tweefontein North relatively protected from additional processes affecting Tweefontein Hill. In contrast, assimilation of the Duitschland footwall is thought to play a key role in the development of the variable but predominantly <b>bottom-loaded</b> PGE mineralisation at Tweefontein Hill. The PGM assemblage is Pd-dominant characterised by Sb-, As- and Bi-bearing PGM, reflecting the incorporation of Sb, As and Bi from the Duitschland footwall. The association of the PGE mineralisation with the extensive basal sulphide development implies that the mineralisation at Tweefontein Hill probably occurred due to the gravitational settling of a sulphide liquid containing a mix of sedimentary and PGE-hosting magmatic components. Due to a significant PGM-BMS association in the mineralised footwall and metasedimentary interlayers/xenoliths, a downward migrating sulphide melt is believed to be the main mechanism responsible for the redistribution of PGE, predominantly Pd, into the mineralised metasedimentary lithologies. Finally, the Platreef and footwall lithologies may be locally modified by late-stage felsic and hydrothermal fluids to form bismuthide- and arsenide-dominant PGM assemblages, primarily hosted in quartz and serpentine respectively. This study shows the PGM and sulphide mineralisation at Tweefontein to be multifaceted, involving magmatic processes, assimilation of the Duitchland footwall into the Platreef magma and late-stage hydrothermal and felsic fluid activity. Footwall composition and irregular floor topography, resulting in depression areas at Tweefontein North and Tweefontein Hill, are believed to play a key role in what processes become significant along the Tweefontein strike. This research represents a significant contribution to the understanding of the distinctly different PGE mineralisation styles at Tweefontein and allows for a complete comparison of the Platreef PGE mineralisation from Overysel to Turfspruit...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{two types}} of coating systems were {{investigated}} {{for their ability to}} withstand cyclic oxidation conditions. NiCoCrAlY coatings with either 0. 1 or 0. 5 weight percent yttrium as well as platinum modified aluminide coatings were examined. All of the samples were exposed cyclically, in a <b>bottom-loading</b> furnace at 1100 °C in laboratory air. Optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the samples. Various surface treatments were performed on the coatings prior to their exposure. Samples were either exposed as-received, with no treatment, light grit blasted (LGB), light grit blasted and etched with NaOH, or fine polished. The samples containing 0. 5 wt. % Y in the as received, LGB and LGB and etched condition, failed by the formation of large oxide protrusions caused by the preferential oxidation of yttrium and by cracking in the coating. The fine polished NiCoCrAlY coatings containing 0. 5 wt. %Y did not develop protrusions and did not fail in test. None of the 0. 1 wt. %Y coatings with any treatment developed protrusions and none of these failed in test. The PtAl coatings all failed by the formation of large voids at the coating/substrate interface that coalesced and broke through the coating surface, regardless of surface treatment. It was concluded that, in the NiCoCrAlY system, the roughness of the coating surface as well as the amount of yttrium present to oxidize in the coating plays a large role in the coating lifetime. In the PtAl coatings, surface preparation did not appear to {{have an effect on the}} coating lifetime. The PtAl coatings and the rough NiCoCrAlY coatings containing 0. 5 wt. %Y were found to have similar lifetimes of a few thousand cycles. The polished 0. 5 wt. %Y NiCoCrAlY coating and all of the 0. 1 wt. %Y coatings exhibited exceptionally long lifetimes, with none of them failing in test...|$|E
