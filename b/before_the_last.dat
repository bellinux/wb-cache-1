5|$|According to the Gospel of Matthew, Judas Iscariot was {{a disciple}} of Jesus. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> Supper, Judas {{went to the}} chief priests and agreed to hand over Jesus in {{exchange}} for 30 silver coins. Jesus was then arrested in Gethsemane, where Judas revealed Jesus' identity to the soldiers by giving him a kiss.|$|E
5|$|Thirty {{pieces of}} silver was {{the price for}} which Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus, {{according}} to an account in the Gospel of Matthew 26:15 in the New Testament. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> Supper, Judas {{is said to have}} gone to the chief priests and agreed to hand over Jesus in exchange for 30 silver coins, and to have returned the money afterwards, filled with remorse.|$|E

30|$|Then, a PrEV’s {{behavior}} processes <b>before</b> <b>the</b> daily <b>last</b> trip mainly influence {{its total}} trip distance, {{which can be}} reflected by its SOC decrease. In practice, we mainly consider the arriving moment of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> trip and <b>the</b> SOC <b>before</b> charging, rather than all the details. Thus the PrEV’s behavior processes <b>before</b> <b>the</b> daily <b>last</b> trip can be simplified, and the remaining processes related with the charging load become even more prominent.|$|R
5|$|Because Ireland became {{isolated}} from mainland Europe by rising sea levels <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> ice age had completely finished, it has fewer land {{animal and plant}} species than Great Britain, which separated later, or mainland Europe. There are 55 mammal species in Ireland and of them only 26 land mammal species are considered native to Ireland. Some species, such as, the red fox, hedgehog and badger, are very common, whereas others, like the Irish hare, red deer and pine marten are less so. Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these are migratory, including the barn swallow.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> Test, Miller {{played for}} Victoria against England {{in his final}} match for his native state before moving to New South Wales. He scored six before being stumped from the medium pace of Bedser and took 4/63 in the first innings, his best bowling since the First Test, as England scored 355 before Victoria replied with 327. His victims {{included}} Gibb, Yardley and Compton for 93, thereby preventing the English batsman from scoring his fifth century in as many innings. The match ended in a draw when England were bowled out for 118 in their second innings; Miller bowled two overs in his final actions for Victoria, conceding two runs without taking a wicket.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> {{round of}} matches, Al-Talaba had 17 points and Al-Shorta had 15. Al-Talaba winning {{in the last}} round and Al-Shorta losing or drawing would secure the title for Al-Talaba but, in the last match, they lost 1–2 against Al-Tayaran and Al-Shorta won 3–0 against Al-Zawra'a to create a tie on points and goal difference, Al-Shorta had scored more goals than Al-Talaba and {{therefore}} {{were expected to be}} crowned champions, but the Iraq FA ruled that the greater number of wins should take precedence and declared Al-Talaba as champions. This was a controversial decision at the time as {{it was the first time}} such a phenomenon had happened in Iraqi football.|$|E

5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the breakout <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> stand—which various writers have posited might {{have actually been}} desertion—and a box of gold sovereigns, which a Matabele inDuna (leader) later claimed {{had been given to}} two unidentified men from Forbes's rear guard on 2 December, along with a message that Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him. Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold, keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message, but the evidence against them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial; the convictions were ultimately overturned.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, the {{servants}} {{fend off the}} villagers. Gaston attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too depressed to fight back, but regains his will upon seeing Belle return. He spares Gaston's life before reuniting with Belle. However, Gaston stabs the Beast, but he loses his footing and falls to his death. The Beast dies <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> petal falls. When Belle tearfully professes her love to him, the curse is broken, repairing the castle and restoring the Beast's and servants' human forms. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily.|$|E
5|$|Excavation for the {{powerhouse}} {{was carried}} out simultaneously with the excavation for the dam foundation and abutments. A U-shaped structure located at the downstream toe of the dam, its excavation was completed in late 1933 with the first concrete placed in November 1933. Filling of Lake Mead began February 1, 1935, even <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> of the concrete was poured that May. The powerhouse {{was one of the}} projects uncompleted {{at the time of the}} formal dedication on September 30, 1935—a crew of 500men remained to finish it and other structures. To make the powerhouse roof bombproof, it was constructed of layers of concrete, rock, and steel with a total thickness of about , topped with layers of sand and tar.|$|E

5|$|He was {{selected}} by the Kansas City Chiefs in the seventh round of the 2012 NFL Draft with the 238th selection overall. He {{is one of three}} Michigan Wolverines and 41 Big Ten players drafted. On May 11, 2012, he signed a four-year contract. On August 31, Hemingway was cut. He was initially signed to the practice squad but was released to make room for Rich Ranglin on September 3 before being resigned to replace Ranglin on September 8. On December 29 (the day <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> game of the 2012 NFL season), the Chiefs placed Terrance Copper on injured reserve and elevated Hemingway from injured reserve.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, all twelve T2000 {{units were}} taken out of service, <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> of the much older T1300. Kollektivtransportproduksjon, the {{successor}} of Oslo Sporveier, stated that procuring spare parts was becoming nearly impossible and that {{the small size of}} the series forced high maintenance costs. The initial orders for MX3000 trains did not call for sufficient numbers to replace the T2000. Kollektivtransportproduksjon has estimated the cost of renovating the units so they can run for 15 more years at NOK50 million. Alternatively, the city council has been recommended by Kollektivtransportproduksjon to purchase 15 new MX3000 three-car trains for NOK250 million.|$|E
5|$|In March 1950 the {{municipality}} decided definitely {{to close the}} tramway, but its actual closure came somewhat later. It was not until Saturday, 28 February 1953 that the last tram ran on the Champ de Courses line, 76 years after the network's first service. But the Rouennaise did not forget the tram's services rendered, organising a first-class funeral: Just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> scheduled run, a parade of honour made up of three trams ran from the Hôtel de ville to the Trianon depot, cheered by the crowds.|$|E

5|$|In {{the event}} {{the office is}} vacant, the {{election}} to replace the president must occur between thirty and seventy days after the vacancy occurred. During normal election cycles, the elections must occur <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> two months of the current president. In either situation, the government body that calls for elections is the House of Representatives. The last round of presidential elections occurred in 2015. President Lukashenko, when addressing the press in February 2007, stated his health will determine if he will run in 2011 or step down at that time.|$|E
5|$|Norfolk has a {{long history}} of human occupation. Both modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000years ago, <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> glaciation, and humans {{returned}} as the ice retreated northwards. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the then prevailing very cold conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic (10,000–5,000BCE), the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are now under the sea in an area now known as Doggerland.|$|E
5|$|Three {{species of}} {{hippopotamus}}, the European hippopotamus (Hippopotamus antiquus), Hippopotamus major and Hippopotamus gorgops, ranged throughout continental Europe and the British Isles. All three species became extinct <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> glaciation. Ancestors of European hippos {{found their way}} to many islands of the Mediterranean Sea during the Pleistocene. The Pleistocene also saw a number of dwarf species evolve on several Mediterranean islands, including Crete (Hippopotamus creutzburgi), Cyprus (the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus, Hippopotamus minor), Malta (Hippopotamus melitensis), and Sicily (Hippopotamus pentlandi). Of these, the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus survived {{until the end of the}} Pleistocene or early Holocene. Evidence from an archaeological site, Aetokremnos, continues to cause debate on whether or not the species was encountered, and was driven to extinction, by man.|$|E

5|$|Within a year, Wizards {{had sold}} {{millions}} {{of copies of}} the Pokémon game, and the company released a new set that included an instructional CD-ROM. Wizards continued to publish the game until 2003. One of Nintendo's affiliates, Pokémon USA, had begun producing a new edition for the game <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> of its agreements with Wizards expired September 30, and Wizards filed suit against Nintendo the following day, October 1, 2003. The two companies resolved their differences in December 2003 without going to court.|$|E
5|$|A common mushroom, Mycena nargan {{is found}} growing singly or in {{clusters}} {{on the underside}} of rotting wood in wet and shaded areas, and is especially partial to Eucalyptus and Pinus pinaster. Fruit bodies usually appear from April to June. The species has been recorded from Tasmania, Victoria and southeastern South Australia. The Australian Fungimap initiative has reported isolated collections in Western Australia, South Australia, and New South Wales, although the majority of sightings have been in Tasmania and Victoria. The fungus is saprobic, meaning it derives nutrients from dead or dying organic matter. A field study conducted in Tasmania showed that it is {{much more likely to be}} found in mature eucalypt forest (defined as having grown at least 70 years <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> wildfire) than young, regenerating forest that had experienced clearfelling, burning, and sowing two to three years previously.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the company's deteriorating {{financial}} situation, Nakayama resigned as president of Sega in January 1998 in favor of Irimajiri. Stolar would subsequently accede to become CEO and president of Sega of America. Following five years of generally declining profits, in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998, Sega suffered its first parent and consolidated financial losses since its 1988 listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to a 54.8% decline in consumer product sales (including a 75.4% decline overseas), the company reported a consolidated net loss of ¥35.6 billion (US$269.8 million). Shortly before announcing its financial losses, Sega revealed that it was discontinuing the Saturn in North America, with the goal of preparing for the launch of its successor. This decision effectively left the Western market without Sega games for over one year. Rumors about the upcoming Dreamcast—spread mainly by Sega itself—leaked to the public <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> Saturn games were released.|$|E
