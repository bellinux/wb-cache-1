500|$|... "One of Us Must Know" [...] is a {{straightforward}} {{account of a}} burned-out relationship. Dissecting what went wrong, the narrator takes a defensive attitude in a one-sided conversation with his former lover. As he presents his case in the opening verse, it appears he is incapable of either acknowledging his part or limiting the abuse: [...] "I didn't mean to treat you so <b>bad.</b> <b>You</b> don't {{have to take it}} so personal. I didn't mean to make you so sad. You just happened to be there, that's all." [...] "One of Us Must Know" [...] was the first recording completed for Blonde on Blonde and the only one selected from the New York sessions. The song was released as the first single from the album on February 14, the same day Dylan began to record in Nashville. It failed to appear on the American charts, but reached number 33 in the UK.|$|E

So {{as soon as the}} movie came on, it was like familiar, things that my pop seen and my uncles seen and, you know, different things like that, things I've seen growing up. So they resonated with me in a way, the story, as well as, I mean, even though everything happens, you know, the way it turns out, you know, it's one of those movies that where you champion the bad guy, because the bad guy, you know, he don't seem like a bad guy, and the good guy — I mean the good guys are <b>bad.</b> <b>You</b> know, that complex — the complexity of human beings in this thing was amazing to me. I loved the complexity of the human beings".|$|E

500|$|Little Mix co-wrote [...] "DNA" [...] with TMS and Iain James. TMS {{developed}} the song's guitar riff, drum beats and synths. It received additional vocal engineering from Daniel Aslet and Ben Collier. Serban Ghenea mixed the track at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, USA, and Tom Coyne {{was responsible for}} the song's mastering. [...] "DNA" [...] was based on the emotions a girl develops when she first meets and dates a boy. In an interview with Emily Laurence of Seventeen, Perrie Edwards explained: [...] "When a girl first gets with a boy, that kind of romance makes you feel really giddy and happy. That's what 'DNA' is about." [...] The group wrote [...] "DNA" [...] as a unique love song by coming up with scientific ideas that would match with love. It was also written as a song about obsession. Speaking to Tim Jonze of The Guardian, Leigh-Anne Pinnock mentioned: [...] "It's not just a love song, it's about being obsessed with someone to the extreme. And sometimes when things go <b>bad</b> <b>you</b> do go like that, you stalk them on Facebook..." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Invading My Mind" [...] {{received}} generally positive acclaim {{from music}} critics. Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly awarded the song a B+ rating, stating that: [...] "Remember when {{the thought of}} Jennifer Lopez releasing good music was as likely as a sequel to Angel Eyes? Well, our bad. The American Idol judge shot up the charts with the cheesetastic Ibiza chant On the Floor. Now she unites with Gaga pal RedOne for this appropriately named piece of pop pleasure: Once the club banger hits your ears, good or <b>bad,</b> <b>you</b> won't {{be able to get}} it out of your head." [...] Tanner Stransky, also of Entertainment Weekly, gave a positive review of the song, stating that between [...] "On the Floor" [...] and [...] "Invading My Mind" [...] Lopez is [...] "really made a glittery return to her extreme club/"Waiting for Tonight" [...] roots". She continued by stating: [...] "Sure, ' Mind' may be shallower than the kiddie pool, but this one is up from the first second... and never goes down". Monica Herrera from Billboard stated that on [...] "Invading My Mind" [...] RedOne and Lady Gaga bring the [...] "hit potential", while Lopez [...] "brings the heat". She continued by stating that the song is an [...] "irresistible '80s euphoria and release".|$|E
500|$|Angelina's {{dream is}} to be a {{successful}} singer on the music charts. DeGarmo noted that her father, Angelo, [...] "who thinks his spoiled-brat daughter sings like a choir of angels" [...] puts pressure on Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), a young and upcoming music producer, to show Angelina the ropes of the music industry and make her a success. DeGarmo said: [...] "Unfortunately, she’s not as good a singer as she and her father think she is [...] Angelina is a bit oblivious to reality, but will slowly come to grips with it over the next few weeks. As a singer myself, it’s liberating to get on the set and throw all ego – and notes – aside and surprise people." [...] DeGarmo commented: [...] "It's fantastically hilarious because it puts the poor kid in a horrible predicament!" [...] She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first, but: [...] "the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland, that sort of thing. We want the audience to be really familiar with the songs, so they can tell how badly Angie is butchering them." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that you needed [...] "skill to play a bad singer", to which DeGarmo said that it's harder than people realize: [...] "but it's really liberating {{to get out there and}} be <b>bad.</b> <b>You</b> just throw your ego to the wind and sing for Jesus." [...] Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer. Angelina briefly fired Devon for adding rap verses to a song of hers which was soaring on the charts, but he retained the rights of the track.|$|E

500|$|Either/Or portrays two life views. Each life view {{is written}} and {{represented}} by a fictional pseudonymous author, with the prose of the work reflecting and depending on the life view being discussed. For example, the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views of the book are not neatly summarized, but are expressed as lived experiences embodied by the pseudonymous authors. The book's central concern is the primal question asked by Aristotle, [...] "How should we live?" [...] His book was certainly informed by Epictetus; [...] "Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do {{you think that you}} can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or <b>bad.</b> <b>You</b> must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob."

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, the play {{has also been}} criticised for some hints of anti-Semitism, {{specifically}} [...] "the disparaging remarks made about moneylenders, who were often Jewish." [...] It {{is true that the}} moneylender Moses is portrayed in a comparatively positive light, but the way he is described (as a [...] "friendly Jew" [...] and an [...] "honest Israelite" [...] by Rowley in III.1) suggest that he is in some way to be considered an exception to Jews in general; also, his own usurious business practices as stated to Sir Peter are clearly less than exemplary (e.g., his statement [...] "If he appears not very anxious for the supply, you should require only forty or fifty per cent; but if you find him in great distress, and want the moneys very <b>bad,</b> <b>you</b> may ask double" [...] ). It may be significant that in Johann Zoffany's portrait of Robert Baddeley as Moses, we find that [...] "Under his arm Moses holds a rolled parchment of the Surface family tree that is used as an auction hammer, and he seems to be ticking off pictures in the catalogue", although in the play Careless is the auctioneer in the relevant scene (IV.1) and Moses has a relatively minor role.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his career, Mahal has {{performed}} his brand of blues (an African American artform) for {{a predominantly white}} audience. This has been a disappointment at times for Mahal, who recognizes {{there is a general}} lack of interest in blues music among many African Americans today. He has drawn a parallel comparison between the blues and rap music in that they both were initially black forms of music that have come to be assimilated into the mainstream of society. He is quoted as saying, [...] "Eighty-one percent of the kids listening to rap were not black kids. Once there was a tremendous amount of money involved in it... they totally moved it over to a material side. It just went off to a terrible direction." [...] Mahal also believes that some people may think the blues are about wallowing in negativity and despair, a position he disagrees with. According to him, [...] "You can listen to my music from front to back, and you don't ever hear me moaning and crying about how <b>bad</b> <b>you</b> done treated me. I think that style of blues and that type of tone was something that happened as a result of many white people feeling very, very guilty about what went down." ...|$|E
