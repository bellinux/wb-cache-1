5|$|The game's setting, Kyrat, is {{a fictional}} {{country in the}} Himalayas region. When {{building}} Kyrat, the developers merged elements from real-world regions including Nepal and Tibet, but exaggerated those elements. The map's size {{is similar to that}} of Far Cry 3, but is more dense, diverse, and features more varied environments. The developers hoped that players could experience a sense of exploration when traveling between the different terrains. The team also hoped that the new location could be believable, while remaining interesting for players. As a result, they created an identify for Kyrat by doing such things as adding different signboards to the game and creating a fictional mythology and religion for Kyrat. The game's world was also designed to accommodate new features such as the helicopter and the grappling hook. In an effort to make the world feel real, the team added improvements to the design of side-quests. Instead of simply being activities for players to complete, the quests are narrative-driven, which was done to increase the connection between them and the world. In order to increase the credibility of the game's world, the studio sent a team to Nepal to experience and record the local culture, so that they could <b>bring</b> <b>those</b> ideas back to the studio. According to the developer, the trip changed the game's design; the focus shifted from the game's civil war, which is inspired by the real-world Nepalese Civil War, to developing unique and interesting characters.|$|E

25|$|The Peruvian {{government}} actively {{seeks to}} attract both {{foreign and domestic}} investment in all sectors of the economy. International investment was spurred by the significant progress Peru made during the 1990s toward economic, social, and political stability, but it slowed again after the government delayed privatizations and as political uncertainty increased in 2000. President Alejandro Toledo has made investment promotion a priority of his government. While Peru was previously marked by terrorism, hyperinflation, and government intervention in the economy, the Government of Peru under former President Alberto Fujimori took the steps necessary to <b>bring</b> <b>those</b> problems under control. Democratic institutions, however, and especially the judiciary, remain weak.|$|E
25|$|The stadium was {{upgraded}} {{multiple times}} in the 1980s beginning with replacement of bench seats with chair back seats and waterproofing of {{the east and west}} stands in 1985. The playing surface was moved 11 feet to the south to center the field in 1986. The north and south ends of the stadium were waterproofed and chair back seats added in 1987 to <b>bring</b> <b>those</b> sections up to date with the 1985 improvements. Also in 1987 the press box was redecorated, a few more seats were installed at the upper portion of the west lower stands, and all seating within the stadium was renumbered using a uniform seat-width. By the end of the 1980s the stadium held 80,150 spectators.|$|E
25|$|It {{emerged that}} a number of the {{suspects}} made prepared statements to police {{on both sides of the}} border, with their legal representatives present, in the weeks after the murder. They were then questioned under caution by the authorities. As the suspects live and travel between the Republic and Northern Ireland, extraditions may have to be sought to <b>bring</b> <b>those</b> responsible to justice in the Republic of Ireland. An Extradition Agreement in place between the Irish and British governments means that extradition orders can only be made when the police force requesting the extradition has sufficient evidence to charge the suspect, and can only question them after they are charged in a court of law.|$|E

25|$|In 1913, the Public Service Commission {{planned a}} new {{platform}} for the shuttle, close to the Lexington Avenue Line station. The platform was constructed, {{but it was never}} used. The wall and roof of the old subway were removed at the curve just south of the old Grand Central station, and trackways were built continuing east under 42nd Street, to <b>bring</b> <b>those</b> two tracks into the new station with a narrow island platform between them. The unused trackways of the proposed shuttle platform were covered with wooden flooring in 1918, and the width of the station was finished up as a passenger walkway between the Lexington Avenue Line and Shuttle stations. The wooden flooring was replaced by concrete in 1946, and the former downtown express track between this station and Times Square–42nd Street was removed in 1975.|$|E

500|$|Julian Jarrold became {{attached}} {{to direct the}} film in early 2005. It was his second feature film, after Kinky Boots, which was released later that year. According to Bernstein, he [...] "liked [...] style as it was modern and visceral, and I just {{had a feeling that}} he was the right choice. This piece needed to be handed with delicacy but also {{with a certain amount of}} brio and Julian was able to <b>bring</b> <b>those</b> two things to the production." [...] The director began work on the project in early 2006, rereading the novels Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Persuasion and also reviewing Austen biographies such as Spence's book. Jarrold depended most heavily on the script, calling it [...] "a rich, witty and clever screenplay from someone who obviously knew his subject very well. It is a love story but much more besides. Kevin's screenplay has so many layers and interesting ideas. Apart from the love story I was very attracted by the themes of imagination and experience." [...] The director intended to [...] "bring Austen up to date by roughening her up a bit" [...] and adding [...] "more life and energy and fun," [...] opining that past Austen adaptations had been [...] "a little bit picture-postcard and safe and sweet and nice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Russell had {{originally}} planned {{to work with}} Bradley Cooper on an adaptation of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, having been impressed with Cooper's performance in Wedding Crashers, citing his [...] "good bad-guy energy" [...] and unpredictability as justification for casting.

[...] As Yim has made clear in interviews and his writings, Xuanzhang is one of his favorite subjects, likely for reasons relating to his own life story and the difficult path he has had to travel as an artist and a man.|$|E

Begg said that, when first approached, he hesitated, [...] "I was worried that it might trivialise my experience", but that he would [...] "help to <b>bring</b> <b>those</b> issues to people who would not usually think about it".

[...] Meyendorff, Schmemann, and Schneirla were already familiar with the Western Rite both from having been in contact with members of the ECOF while teaching at Saint Sergius Theological Institute. Schmemann actively followed the Liturgical Movement in the Roman Catholic and Anglican Church and was an advocate for renewal of the Orthodox liturgy.|$|E
