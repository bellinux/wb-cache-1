50|$|The {{yellow to}} orange color is {{produced}} by the chemical compounds <b>bixin</b> and norbixin, which are classified as carotenoids. The fat-soluble color in the crude extract is called <b>bixin,</b> which can then be saponified into water-soluble norbixin. This dual solubility property of annatto is rare for carotenoids. The seeds contain 4.5-5.5% pigment, which consists of 70-80% <b>bixin.</b> Unlike beta-carotene, another well-known carotenoid, annatto-based pigments are not vitamin A precursors.

40|$|Background: The liver is an {{important}} organ {{for its ability to}} transform xenobiotics, making the liver tissue a prime target for toxic substances. The carotenoid <b>bixin</b> present in annatto is an antioxidant that can protect cells and tissues against the deleterious effects of free radicals. In this study, we evaluated the protective effect of <b>bixin</b> on liver damage induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) in rats.

40|$|Bixa orellana (annatto or {{lipstick}} tree) is {{a perennial}} tropical plant that stores and produces considerable quantities of the apocarotenoid <b>bixin,</b> a culturally and economically important pigment used worldwide. However, the mechanisms underlying the gene regulation and pigment accumulation of <b>bixin</b> and carotenoids in annatto remain unknown. <b>Bixin</b> {{is present in}} the different tissues of the plant, although this pigment is primarily accumulated in the seed coat. Thus, the leaves are useful organs for understanding carotenoid and <b>bixin</b> production, thereby facilitating the study of this pigment, which would otherwise be difficult in ligneous adult plants. To study the regulation of <b>bixin</b> synthesis and to determine which genes are important regulatory molecules at the transcription level, the herbicide norflurazon (NF) was used to block carotenoid synthesis and <b>bixin</b> concentrations in B. orellana leaves.
