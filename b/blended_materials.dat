40|$|An {{acoustic}} wave based-chemical sensor utilizing a crystal substrate and a coating {{of at least}} two <b>blended</b> <b>materials</b> is disclosed. The <b>blended</b> <b>materials</b> comprise a combination of (a) a high glass transition temperature polymer or a material of high melting point, and (b) a low glass transition temperature polymer or a material having a low melting point. Transducers are connected to the crystal substrate to generate an alternating potential across the crystal substrate, which in turn causes the crystal to resonate due to the converse piezoelectric effect. The blended coating absorbs the analyte, thus changing the mass of the chemical sensor, and accordingly changing its resonant frequency. The transducers detect this change in resonant frequency to indicate that the analyte is present. The use of <b>blended</b> <b>materials</b> results in a thicker coating combining the preferred properties of the blend constituents, such as improved detection sensitivities, faster response times, less {{acoustic wave}} damping, and higher operational temperature ranges...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{morphology}} {{on the development}} of electrical trees in semicrystalline polymers has been investigated using a blend of high and low density polyethylene and, for comparison, a low density polyethylene. In the blend system, which contained 20 % high density polyethylene and 80 % of the above low density polyethylene, thermal processing was used to generate a variety of morphologies. Quenching directly from the melt gave a fine-scale banded spherulitic morphology, isothermal crystallization at 115 deg. C gave a continuous, coarse banded spherulitic morphology, whereas crystallization at 124 deg. C, and above, produced discrete and relatively compact lamellar aggregates of high density polyethylene within a low density matrix. The morphology of the low density polyethylene was characterized by fine-scale banded spherulites. The growth of electrical trees was studied in these materials {{as a function of the}} applied ac electrical stress. In the low density <b>material</b> and the <b>blend</b> <b>materials,</b> the rate of development of these structures was found to follow the well-known sigmoidal time dependence, where the increasing fractal dimension (branch density) of the growing tree structure is coupled with a decrease in the tree growth rate with increasing applied voltage. This leads to a local maximum and local minimum in the average growth rates as a function of applied voltage. At all applied voltages, the tree growth rates were found to depend not only on the degree of crystallinity but also on the uniformity of the crystalline phase. Tree growth rates were greatest for LDPE and the quenched <b>blend</b> <b>material</b> and a minimum for the <b>blend</b> <b>material</b> crystallized at 115 deg. C.

Film extrusion of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) has proved to be rather difficult because of its brittleness, but the flexibility of PLA can be improved by incorporation of a plasticizer in the material.

Storage of the plasticized films resulted in an increased crystallinity and changes in the film properties, rendering CH welding difficult.

30|$|Finally, it is {{well known}} in the filed of {{photovoltaic}} applications that solar cells based on SWNT-P 3 HT composites do not work well, although SWNT coatings might be useful as transparent electrodes. The evidence in this work suggests that this failing of the SWNTs is not due to lack of exciton dissociation, since we observe shorter exciton lifetimes as the amount of SWNT is increased. This means that maybe other factors, like recombination of charge carriers in nanotubes or polymer chains, are responsible for their poorer performance in these photovoltaics. On the other hand, in preview work [12] we have reported that PCBM-P 3 HT composites have also a fast exciton dissociation time which quenches the radiative recombination of the polarons/excitons, and increases the yield of photogenerated charged excitations from the PCBM-related states. With increasing the PCBM concentration in the <b>blended</b> <b>materials</b> in that work, we have observed that the relaxation times increase as opposed to the relaxation dynamics upon increasing the SWNT concentration in the same P 3 HT matrix. We believe that this important difference is responsible for the higher photovoltaic performance of PCBM-P 3 HT compared with the SWNT-P 3 HT composite.|$|E
