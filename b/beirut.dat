5|$|On 18 April 1983 a van {{carrying}} a 2,000 pound load of explosives, {{slammed into the}} U.S. embassy in West <b>Beirut,</b> killing 63. In August 1983, Israel withdrew its Defense Forces from the Chouf District (southeast of <b>Beirut),</b> thus removing the buffer between the Druze and the Christian militias and triggering another round of brutal fighting. In August 1983 militiamen began to bombard United States Marines positions near <b>Beirut</b> International Airport with mortar and rocket fire as the Lebanese Army fought Druze and Shia forces in the southern suburbs of <b>Beirut.</b> On 29 August 1983, two Marines were killed and fourteen wounded, and in the ensuing months the Marines came under almost daily attack from artillery, mortar, rocket, and small-arms fire. After this attack the Marines began returning fire. The Reagan Administration decided to dispatch New Jersey, a decision the Marines cheered.|$|E

Misfortune hit <b>Beirut</b> again in 560 when a massive fire ravaged the recovering city.
