500|$|The Stripped Mixes {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. Writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave The Stripped Mixes {{two out of}} five stars, stating that he felt that [...] "the logic of what is left behind doesn't quite make sense", pointing out that [...] "I Want You Back" [...] and [...] "ABC" [...] have no drums and [...] "feel a little tipsy and top-heavy"; [...] "Ben" [...] and [...] "With a Child's Heart" [...] have echoes of strings in the background, {{making it hard to}} identify the songs as being [...] "stripped". He added that since the genius lies in the arrangements, [...] "having so much of the arrangement absent" [...] means that the music [...] "just sounds awkward and incomplete, as if it was waiting for the final round of mixing and overdubs." [...] Erlewine's overall opinion on the album was [...] "if the purpose of this disc is to draw attention to Michael's vocals, The Stripped Mixes does its job, <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> his voice is pushed front and center does not mean that this is the best place to appreciate his genius." ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 2014, Derby {{rejected}} {{an offer}} from Burnley for Bryson. Bryson was however given permission to speak to Burnley, later saying that [...] "it doesn't matter what team it is, when someone puts an offer in for you I think you owe them the respect {{to sit down and}} speak to them... <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> I did that didn't mean I was going to sign for them." [...] Soon afterwards, he agreed a new five-year contract with Derby, saying that his bond with the fans was {{part of the reason that}} he chose to stay: [...] "I've got a good bond with the fans as well and that was a big part in my decision to stay here. The fans have been excellent ever since I walked through the door. When you come to a new club it can take time to win over the fans, but they have been fantastic with me... they helped me make the biggest decision of my career, if not my life. I took a while to think about it and I knew it would be a massive decision. I went through stages where one minute I thought I was leaving and then the next minute I think I'm staying. But in the end it turned out to be an easy decision for me because Derby are such a great club to be part of." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critical {{response}} to Daughtry was mixed; while many critics {{felt that the}} album was generally pleasing and the first real [...] "rock" [...] album from American Idol alumni, others felt it was unoriginal and too commercial. [...] While Ken Barnes of USA Today conceded that Chris Daughtry has [...] "strong pipes and palpable angst", overall he found the band [...] "generic", calling them [...] "FuelNickelStaindback". People magazine found the album [...] "a solid if not spectacular effort that {{at the very least}} proves that Chris Daughtry is not just another Idol also-ran." [...] Christian Hoard (with Rolling Stone) said that [...] " [...] Daughtry gets points for not courting soccer moms, <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> he can howl like a motherfucker doesn't mean he's not a cheeseball." [...] In a truly mixed review, Billboard said the album [...] "is music tailor-made for ill-conceived radio formatting, music for consumers whose taste has already been well-established if not preprogrammed," [...] then added, [...] "But [...] Daughtry sure does sing his butt off." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic awarded the album three and a half stars out of five, calling the album [...] "a debut that's not only a lot more credible than any American Idol-affiliated rock album should be, but it's a lot easier to digest than most of its ilk." [...] In a humorous review, comedian Stephen Colbert found Chris Daughtry's success further proof of the impending [...] "cultural Armageddon." [...] He remarked, [...] "It's bad enough this guy sounds like Creed...but Daughtry's success sets a dangerous precedent of rewarding losers...America elected Taylor Hicks as its Idol, and we owe him our loyalty." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second {{criticism}} that Hume offers {{is about the}} form of the argument as an analogy in itself. An analogical argument claims that because object X (a watch) is like object Y (the universe) in one respect, both are therefore probably alike in another, hidden, respect (their cause, having to be created by an intelligent designer). He points out that for an argument from analogy to be successful, the two things that are being compared have to have an adequate number of similarities that are relevant to the respect that are analogised. For example, a kitten and a lion may be very similar in many respects, <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> a lion makes a [...] "roar", it would not be correct to infer a kitten also [...] "roars": the similarities between the two objects being not similar enough and the degree of relevance to what sound they make being not relevant enough. Hume then argues that the universe and a watch also do not have enough relevant or close similarities to infer that they were both created the same way. For example, the universe is made of organic natural material, but the watch is made of artificial mechanic materials. He claims that in the same respect, the universe could be argued to be more analogous to something more organic such as a vegetable (in which we can observe for ourselves does not need a 'designer' or a 'watchmaker' to be created). Although he admits the analogy of a universe to a vegetable to seem ridiculous, he says that it is just as ridiculous to analogize the universe with a watch.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{journalists and}} video game {{designers}} have questioned this cultural classification, {{arguing that the}} differences between Eastern and Western games have been exaggerated. In an interview held at the American Electronic Entertainment Expo, Japanese video game developer Tetsuya Nomura (who worked on Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts) emphasized that RPGs should not be classified by country-of-origin, but rather described simply for what they are: role-playing games. Hironobu Sakaguchi, creator of Final Fantasy and The Last Story, noted that, while [...] "users like to categorise" [...] Japanese RPGs as [...] "turn-based, traditional styles" [...] and Western RPGs as [...] "born from first-person shooters," [...] there [...] "are titles that don't fit the category," [...] pointing to Chrono Trigger (which he also worked on) and the Mana games. He further noted {{that there have been}} [...] "other games similar to the style of Chrono Trigger," [...] but that [...] "it's probably because the games weren't localised and didn't reach the Western audience." [...] series director Tetsuya Takahashi, in reference to Xenoblade Chronicles, stated that [...] "I don’t know when exactly people started using the term 'JRPG,' but if this game makes people rethink the meaning of this term, I’ll be satisfied." [...] The writer Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com states that [...] "Xenoblade throws into high relief the sheer artificiality of the gaming community's obsession over the differences between" [...] Western and Japanese RPGs, pointing out that it [...] "does things that don't really fit into either genre. Gamers do love their boundaries and barriers and neat little rules, I know, <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> you cram something into a little box doesn't mean it belongs there." [...] Nick Doerr of Joystiq criticizes the claim that Japanese RPGs are [...] "too linear," [...] pointing out that non-linear Japanese RPGs are not uncommonfor instance, the Romancing SaGa series. Likewise, Rowan Kaiser of Joystiq points out that linear Western RPGs were common in the 1990s, and argues that many of the often mentioned differences between Eastern and Western games are stereotypes that are generally [...] "not true" [...] and [...] "never was", pointing to classic examples like Lands of Lore and Betrayal at Krondor that were more narrative-focused than the typical Western-style RPGs of the time. In 2015, IGN noted in an interview with Xenoblade Chronicles Xs development team that the label [...] "JRPG" [...] is most commonly used to refer to RPGs [...] "whose presentation mimics the design sensibilities" [...] of anime and manga, that it's [...] "typically the presentation and character archetypes" [...] that signal [...] "this is a JRPG." ...|$|E
