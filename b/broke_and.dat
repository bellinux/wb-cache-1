5|$|After several failed attempts, they harpooned the {{humpback}} on 31 December 1883.

5|$|Although the Persians stood {{their ground}} for a while, they {{eventually}} <b>broke</b> <b>and</b> fled to the palisade. The soldiers of the right wing followed them into the camp, at which point many of the Persian army fled from the camp, except the ethnic Persian troops, who grouped together and fought the Allied soldiers who entered the camp. Finally, the left wing arrived, outflanking the camp and falling on {{the rear of the}} remaining Persian forces, thereby completing the rout.|$|E

5|$|Blanchard had the {{opportunity}} to play professional football after being selected third overall in the 1946 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. After he was turned down in 1947 for a furlough to play with the NFL, Blanchard then chose to embark upon a career in the United States Air Force and became a fighter pilot.

5|$|On the {{northern}} end of the battlefield, events had unfolded quite differently. Dampierre's cavalry routed Lannoy's company of light horse; the Italians and the contingent from Gruyères, meanwhile, <b>broke</b> <b>and</b> fled—leaving their officers to be killed—without offering any real resistance to the advancing Imperial infantry. As Cardona's infantry moved past the original French line, Enghien descended on it with the entire body of heavy cavalry under his command; the subsequent engagement took place on the reverse slope of the ridge, {{out of sight of the}} rest of the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Patton {{had risen}} to {{national}} prominence, successively chairing the Southern Governors Association, the Democratic Governors Association, and the National Governors Association (NGA). He was serving as NGA chair {{at the time the}} Tina Conner scandal <b>broke,</b> <b>and</b> planned to resign his chairmanship in November 2002. Nevertheless, the other governors rallied around him, convincing him to remain in the position. Together with his Republican vice-chair, Idaho's Dirk Kempthorne, Patton led the NGA effectively, securing federal funding to shore up state budgets and keeping the caucus from a partisan split in a vote over Medicaid.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius {{began running}} in 2004 after a rugby knee injury {{which led to}} {{rehabilitation}} at the University of Pretoria's High Performance Centre with coach Ampie Louw. His first racing blades were fitted by South African prosthetist Francois Vanderwatt. Because {{he was unable to}} find suitable running blades in Pretoria, Vanderwatt ordered some to be made by a local engineer at Hanger Orthopedic Group. These quickly <b>broke,</b> <b>and</b> Vanderwatt referred Pistorius to American prosthetist and Paralympic sprinter Brian Frasure to be fitted for carbon-fibre blades by Icelandic company Össur.|$|E

5|$|When {{the battle}} was joined, the cavalry engaged in a fierce {{exchange}} on the flanks. Polybius described the Hispanic and Celtic horse dismounting in what he considers a barbarian method of fighting. When the Hispanic and Gauls got the upper hand, they cut down the Roman cavalry without giving quarter. On the other flank the Numidians engaged {{in a way that}} merely kept the Roman allied cavalry occupied. When the victorious Hispanic and Gallic cavalry came up, the allied cavalry <b>broke</b> <b>and</b> the Numidians pursued them off the field.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{the tribes}} were better {{represented}} in the republican government. In 1969, sheikhs were brought into the National Assembly and in 1971 into the Consultative Council. Under Iryani, the sheikhs, particularly the ones who fought for the republicans and were close to the mediation attempt. By {{the end of the}} war there was a breach between the older and more liberal politicians and republican sheiks, and certain army sheiks and activists from South Yemen. In the summer of 1972, a border war <b>broke</b> <b>and</b> ended with a declaration from both North Yemen and South Yemen that they would reunite, but they did not. There were complaints in North Yemen about foreign influence by Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|Alexios, who was {{fighting}} with his retinue alongside the Franks, {{did not immediately}} realize that his left wing had collapsed. In the meantime, on his right wing, the Chomatenoi, engaged with Tarchaneiotes's men, were outflanked and attacked in the rear by the Pechenegs, who had somehow evaded Alexios's Turkish flank-guards. The Chomatenoi too <b>broke</b> <b>and</b> fled, and Alexios's fate seemed sealed. At this point the Pechenegs failed to follow up their success, and instead turned back and began looting Bryennios's own camp. After gathering what plunder they could, they left the battle and made for their homes.|$|E

5|$|Another of Dannatt's {{priorities}} was {{tackling the}} perception of the British operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as he was concerned the news media and the British public were unaware of the purpose or the intensity of the missions. Disgruntled by increasingly negative coverage, he interrupted a family holiday in Cornwall to fly to Afghanistan in an effort to change the coverage through a series of interviews. During the visit, he managed to meet with his son, Bertie, who was serving in the country with the Grenadier Guards. Later in 2007, Dannatt raised the same issue in a lecture to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Earlier that year, Dannatt had taken the decision not to allow Prince Harry to serve in Iraq. However, after Dannatt had brokered an understanding with the British press, Harry was able to serve in Afghanistan for three months in late 2007 and early 2008 until the story <b>broke</b> <b>and</b> he was ordered home.|$|E
5|$|As dawn <b>broke</b> <b>and</b> {{visibility}} cleared, {{the sailors}} on Ceylon, Vénus and Victor realised {{that they were}} within sight of Saint Denis on Île Bourbon, and thus vulnerable to counterattack from Rowley's flagship Boadicea. Despite hasty repairs, neither Ceylon nor Vénus were seaworthy by 07:30, when British lookouts on the island spotted the three ships and sent word to Rowley. Within ten minutes, Rowley was at sea, taking 50 volunteers from Africaine to augment his crew. Hamelin made desperate efforts to limp back to Île de France, ordering Victor to tow Ceylon, but progress was slow and strong winds, which did not help the dismasted Ceylon and Vénus, repeatedly broke the tow rope.|$|E
5|$|By 1955, talks began about {{upgrading}} the highway. After a proposition to turn {{much of the}} route into a toll road failed, it was decided a four-lane freeway {{would be the best}} decision. However, opposition from residents in surrounding neighborhoods as well as a federal oil embargo only allowed widening of the approach between Fairgrounds Drive and I-80. In 1977, a levee <b>broke</b> <b>and</b> flooded a portion of the developed land, turning it into protected wetlands that is home to endangered species. Because of its new status, environmental studies were needed in order to continue the project.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{retirement}} as a footballer, Wills turned to umpiring and committee work, {{and despite his}} continued slide into debt, donated money and trophies for football competitions. He served as Geelong's vice-president from 1873 to 1876, {{and was one of}} three delegates appointed by the club after the 1877 formation of the Victorian Football Association (VFA), but was dropped soon after for unknown reasons. During the 1878 VFA season, he acted as central umpire, and defended his adjudication of a June match between Carlton and Albert Park in what would be his last public letter. That year, Wills, <b>broke</b> <b>and</b> hounded by creditors, began selling land in Geelong to help clear his debt, and moved with Barbor to South Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} Byzantine Italy and Saracen Sicily, the Byzantine emperor, Michael VII Doukas (r. 1071–1078), betrothed {{his son to}} Robert Guiscard's daughter. When Michael was deposed, Robert took this {{as an excuse to}} invade the Byzantine Empire in 1081. His army laid siege to Dyrrhachium, but his fleet was {{defeated}} by the Venetians. On October 18, the Normans engaged a Byzantine army under Alexios I Komnenos outside Dyrrhachium. The battle began with the Byzantine right wing routing the Norman left wing, which <b>broke</b> <b>and</b> fled. Varangian mercenaries joined in the pursuit of the fleeing Normans, but became separated from the main force and were massacred. Norman knights in the centre attacked the Byzantine centre and routed it, causing the bulk of the Byzantine army to rout.|$|E
5|$|For another week, North Korean {{divisions}} launched all {{the troops}} {{they had in}} massed attacks against the ROK and US lines. Their attacks, which usually occurred at night and were supported by armor and artillery, advanced with infantry and tanks in close support of one another. Each North Korean attack ran into well-established UN lines, where US tanks, mines and entrenched infantry were positioned to counter them. Strikes by US aircraft ravaged the attacking North Koreans. The fighting was fierce with many casualties on both sides, particularly where the North and South Koreans fought one another. The repeated attacks eventually <b>broke</b> <b>and</b> pushed back the North Korean forces. They continued their push against the Pusan Perimeter until they were outflanked in the Battle of Inchon.|$|E
