5|$|Peniophora limulata {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to P.quercina. However, {{the edges of the}} fruit body are highlighted in a dark <b>black,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> species favours ash, as opposed to oak.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be employed}} {{in the field to}} aid in the identification of S.pungens. With an application of a drop of KOH, the flesh will turn vinaceous (the color of red wine), the tubes red, the cap cuticle <b>black,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stipe cuticle pale vinaceous. With ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), the flesh becomes very pale vinaceous, and the tubes turn bright red. Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) turns the flesh gray, the tubes dark gray to <b>black,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stipe cuticle light gray.|$|E

5|$|After 1914, the Church of God in Christ {{would become}} {{predominantly}} <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Assemblies of God would remain predominantly white. However, there were African Americans {{involved in the}} early years of the Assemblies of God. The African-American pastor Garfield Thomas Haywood, for example, pastored one of the largest churches and was an influential voice within the fellowship until he withdrew from the denomination after 1916.|$|E

5|$|Nitro {{operates}} {{with two}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has six cars that can seat four rides {{in a single}} row, {{for a total of}} 24 riders per train; each seat has its own individual over the shoulder restraint. The structure of the trains are coloured blue, red, and yellow; the seats are <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> restraints are yellow. Also, unlike traditional steel roller coasters, Nitro has no floor on its trains.|$|E

5|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} was filmed at an abandoned warehouse. The clip shows the group dancing and singing {{in front of}} colourful backdrops and a pink Union Jack flag, wearing urban-styled outfits corresponding to the backdrops. The video received favorable reviews from critics, who praised the group's fashion sense, dancing and confidence. Little Mix promoted the song by performing it live {{on a number of}} television shows (including Red or <b>Black?</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> X Factor Australia) and during their 2013 DNA Tour.|$|E

5|$|The eggs hatch within between 23 and 32 {{hours of}} each other and can be preceded by the chick in the egg calling for up to 45 hours before {{hatching}}. One hatching was recorded as taking 15 hours to complete.

5|$|The {{story has}} been read as an {{analysis}} of race relations, not {{between black and white}} but within the black community, exploring its own color and class prejudices. The main character dreams of becoming white but ultimately seems to accept being <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> full history of African Americans in the United States. The ending of the story, however, has been called ambiguous and leaves several questions unanswered.|$|E
5|$|Through the 18thand19thcenturies, {{chestnut}} {{in various}} shades was the prevailing colour of Finnish horses, making up about 40-50percent of the breed, and bays, blacks and greys existed in much greater numbers than today: 34percent were bay, 16percent <b>black,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> remaining 3percent were grey, palomino or spotted. Wide blazes and high leg markings were rare, unlike today; bold markings became common {{only in the}} 20thcentury.|$|E

Dog in the Sand added Dave Philips on pedal steel guitar and lead guitar, and Santiago and Feldman began making occasional appearances with the group live and on record. Both Pistolero and Dog in the Sand were produced by Nick Vincent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Black</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> FBI {{investigate}} the crime scene; Black not only realises the bomber's proficiency with explosives, but {{is able to}} work out that he viewed the bombing from the parking garage. In a bin in the garage, they find a tissue covered in Dees' semen. Black informs the FBI that the bomber is smart {{enough to be able}} to tap into their phonecalls, and volunteers to bait him into eavesdropping on his mobile phone. Black's deduction is correct, and as he attempts to stall Dees on the phone while the FBI trace the call, he realises from Dees' language that the bomber is seeking to become famous through his actions. Dees informs the FBI that he has planned another bombing for the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Donald Gray, who {{had found}} himself typecast after {{appearing}} in the lead role in Saber of London, a detective series, was having to resort to voice work to support his acting career. The South African actor was selected for three regular roles: Colonel White, Captain <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mysterons. After his mind is hijacked in the pilot episode, Black speaks with the same voice that the Mysterons are heard to use when transmitting threats to Earth. For his portrayals of Black and his Mysteron masters, Gray's voice was electronically deepened, by running the tape at high speed whilst he was recording his lines and playing it back at normal speed, to produce a haunting effect.|$|E

5|$|Female banded sugar ants {{are easily}} {{recognised}} by their black head, orange thorax and the orange-brown band that wraps around their gaster. Males {{of the species}} are completely black. The dark sides of the thorax and legs are ferruginous (rusty in colour). The scape (the base of the antenna) and mandibles are <b>black,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> head is wider than the thorax. The thorax is longer than its total width and slightly compressed, and the gaster is covered with tiny black dots. Erect setae are golden in colour and absent under the head but present on the mesosoma. The setae on the tibia and scape are shorter than those on the mesosoma. The anterior of the gaster is lighter in colour compared to the posterior, and the dorsum of the mesosoma is outlined and curved. A worker's metanotum is absent and the eyes are bulging, while a soldier's metanotum is noticeable and the eyes are flat. The wings on the queen are dark, and the stigmata and nerves are yellow. While many ant species have a metapleural gland, the gland is not present in the banded sugar ant; the number of malpighian tubules in workers is 21.|$|E
5|$|In June 1941, Mengele {{was posted}} to Ukraine, {{where he was}} awarded the Iron Cross Second Class. In January 1942, he joined the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking as a {{battalion}} medical officer. He rescued two German soldiers from a burning tank and was awarded the Iron Cross First Class, as well as the Wound Badge in <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Medal for the Care of the German People. He was seriously wounded in action near Rostov-on-Don in mid-1942, and was declared unfit for further active service. After recovery, he was transferred to the Race and Resettlement Office in Berlin. He also resumed his association with von Verschuer, who was at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics. Mengele was promoted to the rank of SS-Hauptsturmführer (captain) in April 1943.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a mysteriously ill Jordan {{continues}} {{to ask about}} Helen's whereabouts, and her remarks about Helen's conditions lead Black to believe she is starting to experience the seemingly-psychic visions {{he is capable of}} seeing, which allow him to see the evil people are capable of. Elsewhere, Green is arrested. His property is searched but Helen is nowhere to be found—although another corpse is dug up in the garden, evidently killed nine years before. Black deduces that Green could not have killed Helen at the cabin as his house was already being watched by the police. He sees a set of tools in Green's home which he realizes were not used for murder or torture, but to immure Helen in the basement. <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> police dismantle a newly finished plaster wall, finding Helen injured but alive; it is at this point that Black realizes Green was simply a pawn, used by his father to lure victims to the house.|$|E
