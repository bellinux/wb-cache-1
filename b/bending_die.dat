The main problem of the bending process is the spring-back phenomenon after removing the punch. This research aims the investigation on effect of residual stress on springback behavior of sheet metal in U bending process. The corner setting technique and bottoming process were designed for experiments. The corner setting technique and bottoming has reduced the thickness in bending area to 5, 10, 15 and 20 percent of the original sheet thickness. Clearance between punch and die of both processes was equal to same the thickness. The residual stress value and springback phenomenal were investigated by commercial program code DEFORM 2 D which was able to analyze the effect stress and force in bending area.

40|$|The {{demand for}} weight {{reduction}} in automobiles {{to reduce fuel consumption}} pushed the spring manufacturer to choose higher-strength martensitic steels {{to reduce the}} resisting section of the wire, and for this reason the weight of the spring. The traditional approach in forming such materials is based on the hot coiling of the wire at high temperature to increase material formability and to reduce the required forming forces. Another approach is the cold forming process wherein the wire is heat treated before the spring is formed to improve its formability. In both cases the coiled spring has to be hardened and tempered to reach the target strength. Energy and time consumption due to the final heat treatment slow production and increase the manufacturing cost of the spring. The two-fold target of shortening the process cycle and reducing the weight of the spring was met successfully in cold forming the material in its final condition (hardened and tempered). In this case the coiling process becomes more critical because the formability of these high-strength martensitic steels is not very high. The trend of using high-strength steels (between 1800 and 2100 MPa) increases the difficulties in the cold forming of such wires and can lead to the failure of the coiled wire caused by the breakage of the spring. 1 - 3 The forming forces required in the coiling of the wire increase with the high strength of the material causing the feeding force to also increase. The feeding rolls should provide enough force to avoid the slip of the wire between the rolls. For this reason the friction between the wire and the feeding rolls should be at a high level to provide enough tangential force to avoid any slip of the wire. On the other hand, high friction increases the required forming force due to the higher contribution of friction forces developing in the stationary dies where the wire slides as in the guiding plate, in the <b>bending</b> <b>die</b> and in the bar controlling the axial pitch of the spring. The contribution made by the <b>bending</b> <b>die</b> can be reduced using two bending rolls where the sliding friction is substituted by a prevalent rolling friction. This solution has been successfully used by spring manufacturers, who still face the problem of friction in the remaining components of the coiling machine: in the feeding system the friction should be high and elsewhere should be low. The insertion of a lubricating station between feeding and forming can solve the problem, but can be difficult in the industrial application, generating a dirty area of the press and requiring a cleaning step after coiling to remove residual lubricant from the spring’s external surface. For these reasons, the spring manufacturer asks for a wire with an external oxide, which should act as a thin solid lubricant layer. If this layer is too thin, it can be broken when the wire is passing between the feeding rolls, causing a possible slip of the wire and an increase of friction in the forming section of the press. Slipping in the feeding rolls can be eliminated by increasing the radial pressure of the rolls on the wire, but this action can introduce damage to the wire and eventually can lead to failure in the coiling of the spring. The investigation has been focused on the effect of friction {{as well as on the}} set-up of the coiling machine, and it is based on a preliminary experimental analysis of different wires. Different samples of the same steel with different Fe-oxide layers have been tested in the coiling machine. Most of them allow the correct manufacture of the spring, but some result in the breakage of the spring during coiling. The samples have been characterized in the laboratory relative to mechanical properties, microstructure, thickness of the oxide layer and its morphology and type of oxide and its adherence to the steel underneath. Afterwards, a numerical model of the spring coiling process has been developed introducing the description of the Lemaitre damage model in the material properties. Relative damage has been used as the index to estimate the risk of failure when different friction and process parameters are used...|$|E

Precise predictions of spring-back angle after the bending process are the key to the design of the <b>bending</b> <b>die,</b> bending tool, and to produce the accuracy part geometry. This thesis purpose is to determine the reliability of analytical method in V-bending analysis of stainless steel by comparing the results with experimental results and the experimental measurements of Özgür (2008). The effects of significant parameters including sheet thickness and sheet anisotropy on spring-back in V-bending analysis also have been studies. The mechanical properties that provided from tensile test experiment have been used in the analytical calculation in solving the spring-back equation. Two different equations from previous studies have been used to determine the spring-back angle. In the V-bending experiment, two different test procedures (bottoming and air V-bending process) were used. The experimental results have been used to evaluate the analytical results. The results of this project shown the spring-back values for analytical calculation are generally is not in agreement with the experimental value but the graph trends obtained in this study are generally in agreement with experimental graph patterns. The graph patterns are also in agreement with the past study by other researcher (Özgür, 2008). Increasing the sheet thickness resulted increase in the spring-back angle. The orientation angle and anisotropy value R will influence the spring-back. In general, the spring-back angle is increase if the orientation angle is increase. Therefore, the 0 degree orientation angle is a suitable condition in V-bending processes because the spring-back value is smallest compared to other orientation angles. The percentage error is very high because there are some errors occur during the tensile specimen preparation, tensile test experiment and V-bending test experiment. The accuracy and precision of machine in collecting and determined the data is a factors as the higher percentage error. It is conclude that the analytical method is not suitable in sheet metal bending analysis of stainless steel. This is because, combination of various material types and process parameters make the exact prediction of spring-back difficult...|$|E

40|$|Tube bending is {{a widely}} used {{manufacturing}} process in the aerospace, automotive, and other industries. During tube bending, considerable in-plane distortion and thickness variation occurs. The thickness increases at the intrados (surface of tube {{in contact with the}} die) and it reduces at the extrados (outer surface of the tube). In some cases, when the <b>bend</b> <b>die</b> radius is small, wrinkling occurs at the intrados. In industry a mandrel is used to eliminate wrinkling and reduce distortion. However, {{in the case of a}} close <b>bend</b> <b>die</b> radius, use of a mandrel should be avoided as bending with the mandrel increases the thinning of the wall at the extrados, which is undesirable in the manufacturing operation. The present research focuses on additional loadings such as axial force and internal pressure which can be used to achieve better shape control and thickness distribution of the tube. Based on plasticity theories, an analytical model is developed to predict cross section distortion and thickness change of tubes under various loading conditions. Results from both the FEA and analytical model indicated that at the intrados the increase in thickness for bending with internal pressure and bending with combined axial pull and internal pressure was nearly the same. But in the case of bending with the combination of axial pull and internal pressure there was a significant reduction of thickness at the extrados. A parametric study was conducted for the case of bending with combined internal pressure and axial pull and it was seen that with proper selection of the pressure and axial pull wrinkling can be eliminated, thickness distribution around the tube can be optimized, and cross section distortion of the tube can be reduced. Predictions of the analytical model are in good agreement with finite element simulations and published experimental results. The model can be used to evaluate tooling and process design in tube bending...|$|R
