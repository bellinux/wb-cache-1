5|$|To {{begin the}} game, a {{category}} is revealed, {{and the three}} teams of three contestants are asked multiple choice questions under that category, with each question having four possible answers. The contestant who buzzes in with the correct answer earns the respective team 100 points; an incorrect answer loses 100 points, and opens up the question to the other teams. Contestants must {{wait until after the}} host reads the entire question (including the choices) to <b>buzz</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
5|$|At 1:24a.m., {{one of the}} two men outside {{pushed the}} buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen who heard of a {{disturbance}} in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to <b>buzz</b> <b>in</b> the men. When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax. The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.|$|E
25|$|Zone In - In this mini-game, {{players have}} to <b>buzz</b> <b>in</b> at {{the perfect time}} to get the right answer.|$|E
50|$|The {{moderator}} {{does not}} complete the question if a team <b>buzzes</b> <b>in</b> before the full question is read.If {{the team that}} <b>buzzes</b> <b>in</b> answers incorrectly, the moderator re-reads the question and then allows other team(s) an opportunity to respond. Ten seconds are allowed for response and only one response per team is accepted after a team has <b>buzzed</b> <b>in.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the event}} that a {{contestant}} <b>buzzed</b> <b>in</b> and got a question wrong, the question would be offered to other contestants, signaled by a buzzer sounding. But a contestant <b>buzzing</b> <b>in</b> and giving no answer at all {{would result in a}} doorbell sound and the answer was revealed ...|$|R
5000|$|In some volumes, {{the host}} also punishes {{a player who}} <b>buzzes</b> <b>in</b> too early; the {{question}} disappears, leaving the player with ten seconds to type the answer. For both The Ride and Fifth Dementia, this is replaced by different punishments: the player is forced to pick {{from a list of}} four nonsensical answers, all of which are wrong, or both the question and answers are scrambled. This punishment is only triggered if a player <b>buzzes</b> <b>in</b> at the very instant that the question appears on the screen. In those three instances, the player that <b>buzzed</b> <b>in</b> is not permitted to [...] "screw" [...] the other players.|$|R
25|$|On February 14, 2011, WTT {{announced}} that the New York Buzz and New York Sportimes had merged with the resulting combined team {{to be called the}} New York Sportimes. The team would play five of its seven home matches each season at Sportime Stadium at Randall's Island and the other two at SEFCU Arena in Guilderland, former home of the Buzz. The combined franchise could claim a period of great success over the previous six seasons (2005–2010): 2 King Trophies (Sportimes in 2005 and <b>Buzz</b> <b>in</b> 2008), 5 Eastern Conference Championships (Sportimes in 2005, 2006 and 2010 and <b>Buzz</b> <b>in</b> 2007 and 2008) and 6 consecutive first-place finishes (Sportimes in 2005, 2006, 2009 and 2010 and <b>Buzz</b> <b>in</b> 2007 and 2008).|$|E

25|$|Unlike the {{question}} rounds, Beat the Buzzer {{is open for}} all teams to answer. Simon Reeve reads out questions to all contestants, who <b>buzz</b> <b>in</b> to answer. This is the most competitive segment of the show as teams attempt to <b>buzz</b> <b>in</b> before other teams in order to score points (10 per correct question). Beat the Buzzer is a speed round lasting for 45 seconds. If the team answers a question after time is up, the team would not gain or lose 10 points regardless if it's right or wrong.|$|E
5000|$|The live {{semifinal}}s {{started on}} August 30, 2016. They feature the 21 acts voted to the semifinals, plus the judges' semifinal wildcard pick. Each week, eleven acts will perform. Five will go through, while six will be eliminated. No acts were <b>buzzed</b> <b>in</b> the semifinals. This {{was the first}} time since season 9 that no one got <b>buzzed</b> <b>in</b> the semifinals.|$|R
5000|$|Regardless of who <b>buzzes</b> <b>in</b> on a team, {{anyone on}} the team may answer the {{question}} ...|$|R

25|$|The {{following}} table shows {{regular season}} records, playoff results and titles {{won by the}} New York Sportimes franchise prior to its relocation to San Diego in 2014, and not including any results inherited {{as a result of}} the merger with the New York <b>Buzz</b> <b>in</b> 2011.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2000 season, the Electrics were {{renamed the}} New York Buzz. The Buzz {{continued}} {{to retain the}} rights to Martina Navratilova, but {{for the second consecutive}} season, she was the only returning player. The new players selected by the <b>Buzz</b> <b>in</b> the roster draft were Mahesh Bhupathi (frequent mixed doubles partner of Navratilova), Justin Bower, Jana Nejedly (top ranked Canadian female at the time) and 1996 NCAA singles champion Jill Craybas. In May, Navratilova announced should {{would not be able to}} play for the <b>Buzz</b> <b>in</b> 2001, due to scheduling conflicts. In July, she signed with the Delaware Smash and played two matches with them filling in for Serena Williams. The Buzz finished the season with 9 wins and 5 losses, second in the Eastern Conference, just one match behind conference champion Philadelphia Freedoms.|$|E
25|$|The band then {{switched}} to veteran Christian producer/artist Steve Taylor, after sharing the bill with Taylor on his worldwide Squinternational tour. Under his direction {{they returned to}} a harder sound and released <b>Buzz</b> <b>in</b> 1995. They supported the release with yet another worldwide tour—including extensive dates in Latin America. In 1997, the band released the Taylor-produced Bottle Rocket and their second Spanish album, Promesa (Promise).|$|E
50|$|The toss-up {{was worth}} a {{dishwasher}} or {{a trip to a}} hotel <b>in</b> Poland. Whoever <b>buzzed</b> <b>in</b> and solved the puzzle first won the dishwasher or trip and began Round 1. If the first player was wrong, the next player in line got a shot at the puzzle. The puzzle board's border lighted up red, yellow, or green to show who had <b>buzzed</b> <b>in.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In this round, {{one of the}} {{two players}} can decide to leave the game and take home a {{valuable}} price. If both reject this option, an open-ended buzzer question is asked. If a contestant <b>buzzes</b> <b>in</b> with the correct answer, they proceed. If a contestant <b>buzzes</b> <b>in</b> with a wrong answer, they get eliminated and their opponent moves on to the final round where the case game is played.|$|R
60|$|Now {{the roar}} had got {{so loud that}} it <b>buzzed</b> <b>in</b> one's ears, and every instant it grew louder.|$|R
25|$|Boris Becker {{was chosen}} by the <b>Buzz</b> <b>in</b> the 2003 marquee player draft. Nannie DeVilliers and Justin Bower {{returned}} from the 2002 Eastern Conference Champions. Don Johnson and Eva Dyrberg were the other newcomers. Jolene Watanabe was named the new coach of the Buzz becoming the first female coach in WTT history. The Buzz struggled in 2003, finishing the season with 4 wins and 10 losses.|$|E
25|$|Two contestants competed. The {{object was}} {{to remove the}} digits 1 through 9 from a game board by rolling an {{oversized}} pair of dice. In order to determine who gained control of the dice, the host asked a toss-up question. The answers were usually multiple choice, true/false, or yes/no. The first contestant to <b>buzz</b> <b>in</b> received the chance to answer, and answering correctly won control. If that contestant did not answer correctly, control went to the opponent.|$|E
25|$|As in Sale, {{the game}} was split into four rounds. Contestants begin with a score of $20. When Edward Phillips asks a question, the first {{contestant}} to <b>buzz</b> <b>in</b> {{had the chance to}} answer the question; if correct, he or she gained $5; if wrong, he or she lost $5. Phillips revealed the answer immediately if the contestant answered incorrectly; no other contestants were given the opportunity to answer. Contestants needed not wait until Phillips had finished asking the question before buzzing in.|$|E
60|$|Forthwith {{there was}} heard a great <b>buzzing</b> <b>in</b> the air, and {{a swarm of}} black bees came flying toward her.|$|R
50|$|In {{a typical}} round, Plomley read {{out a piece}} of text {{prepared}} by Messiter, and contestants <b>buzzed</b> <b>in</b> if they detected an error. Correctly identifying an error scored one point and supplying a correction was worth a second; if a contestant <b>buzzed</b> <b>in</b> when there was no error, two points were awarded to the opposing team. Occasionally a third point was awarded when a contestant spotted a mistake Messiter had not intended.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first line}} [...] "W Szczebrzeszynie chrząszcz brzmi w trzcinie"(In Szczebrzeszyn a beetle <b>buzzes</b> <b>in</b> the reed) is a {{well-known}} Polish tongue-twister.|$|R
25|$|Justice Loh {{also created}} a <b>buzz</b> <b>in</b> legal circles by departing from the {{inherent}} tendency test and instead favouring the real risk test. According to lawyers who had studied such cases, what the judge did was significant because the real risk formula is clearer, {{even though he had}} defined it broadly. Under his definition, a statement with even a small risk of undermining public confidence in the courts would be found to be in contempt. The use of the real risk test is also significant as it {{comes at a time when}} the Government is planning to codify the law on contempt.|$|E
25|$|In the {{championship}} round each board was worth money, beginning at $200 and increasing by $100 {{for each additional}} board until someone won the game. Each board had a specific category for it and six words fitting that category on it. Henry read a clue {{for one of the}} words, and the first contestant to <b>buzz</b> <b>in</b> and correctly locate it was given twenty seconds to find the other five words. Doing so won the value of the board, but if the contestant could not do this the opposing contestant got a chance to steal by finding just one of the remaining words within five seconds. Doing so won the opponent the money attached to the board; otherwise, the money stayed with the first contestant.|$|E
25|$|Under the 2008 playoff format, the Sportimes {{were the}} number 3 seed and matched against the number 2 seed and Eastern Conference Champion New York <b>Buzz</b> <b>in</b> the WTT Semifinals. In {{the first ever}} matchup between the two New York clubs, the Buzz {{dominated}} the match winning the first four sets. Nathan Healey and Yaroslava Shvedova opened the match with a 5–3 set win against John McEnroe and Hana Šromová in mixed doubles. Shvedova followed with a 5–2 women's singles win over Ashley Harkleroad. Healy took care of Jesse Witten, 5–2, in men's singles. Gabriela Navrátilová and Shvedova needed a tiebreaker to beat Harkleroad and Šromová, 5–4, and give the Buzz a 20–11 lead heading to the final set. McEnroe and Witten won a tiebreaker over Patrick Briaud and Healy in the men's doubles to force overtime with the Buzz leading 24–16. Briaud and Healy won the second game of overtime to give the Buzz a 25–17 victory and end the Sportimes' season.|$|E

25|$|The San Diego Aviators are a World TeamTennis (WTT) {{team that}} plays at the Omni La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad, California in the United States of America. The team is the {{successor}} to two WTT franchises. The first was created in 1995, as the New York OTBzz, later renamed the Schenectady County Electrics and then the New York Buzz. The second was created in 2000, as the New York Hamptons, later renamed the New York Sportimes. The Aviators, founded in 1995, are the oldest continuously operating franchise in WTT. The team has won the King Trophy as WTT champions three times: once playing as the New York Sportimes in 2005, once as the New York <b>Buzz</b> <b>in</b> 2008, and once as the San Diego Aviators in 2016. As of 2016, the three championships {{is the second most}} of any active WTT franchise behind the Washington Kastles, who have won six.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, McGrady {{signed a}} longterm {{partnership}} with Adidas, agreeing to an endorsement deal that lasted through his playing career and beyond. Adidas produced a signature line of shoes for McGrady that Complex remembered as [...] "all the <b>buzz</b> <b>in</b> the early-mid 2000's". Upon retiring, McGrady shifted his focus to his business investments, including Dasdak, a Washington, D.C.-based technology company, and Blue-04, a bottled water company in Florida. He is also part-owner of a Minor League Baseball team {{set to begin}} play in Biloxi, Mississippi. Since 2016, he has worked as an NBA analyst for ESPN.|$|E
500|$|After ten {{questions}} are completed, {{the final round}} of the game is the [...] "Jack Attack" [...] where all players compete against each other. Prior to the round, a brief clue is shown to the players to describe a relationship that they must match, for example [...] "BFF" [...] (Best friends forever). The game then shows one word or phrase, and then cycles through other phrases which the players must match. If players respond to the wrong phrase, they lose money; only the first player to <b>buzz</b> <b>in</b> at the correct time wins and earns money. [...] After seven such phrases, the total scores are added and the winner is determined.|$|E
