5|$|Another {{innovation}} was {{a mobile}} pillbox that could <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> {{out onto the}} airfield. This {{was known as the}} Bison and consisted of a lorry with a concrete armoured cabin and a small concrete pillbox on the flat bed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the tentacles in some species lie acrorhagi, {{elongated}} inflatable tentacle-like organs armed with cnidocytes, that can flail around and fend off other encroaching anemones; one or both anemones can <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> off or suffer injury in such battles.|$|E
50|$|These EMUs <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> by four 185 kW 1500 Volts DC motors. Units {{built before}} 1970 <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> by a Jeumont-Heidmann {{camshaft}} controller. After 1970, Thyristor <b>drive</b> <b>were</b> used instead.|$|R

5|$|I {{am not a}} man who can <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> or drummed by threats {{or abuse}} into an {{attitude}} of justification. But I consider it due to my honour as a loyal British subject and my personal dignity as a man to retire all my public positions.|$|E
5|$|If the {{undamaged}} part {{were the}} rear {{half of the}} train, this would <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> by the Chef du Train, who is a fully authorised driver and occupies the rear driving cab while the train travels through the tunnel for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|In mid-October, {{the comet}} {{developed}} a notable antitail, pointing towards the Sun. Anti-tails are a fairly common cometary phenomenon, and result from orbital geometry giving {{the appearance of}} a tail pointing towards the Sun although material can only <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> away from the Sun.|$|E
50|$|While most {{mandrels}} <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> {{by direct}} connection to an electric motor or engine, other mandrels <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> by attachment to a bearing-supported, pulley-driven shaft.|$|R
5000|$|The engine has a {{single-stage}} fan with 29 titanium blades and a Kevlar outer shell, which <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by a three-stage turbine.

5|$|St Kilda road is {{the only}} access road and connects to Port Wakefield road at Waterloo Corner. St Kilda can <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> to from Salisbury in {{approximately}} 10minutes and from Adelaide's CBD in 30minutes. There are no scheduled bus services with the nearest public transport the Transadelaide 900 bus route which passes along Port Wakefield road, 2kilometres outside the suburb's boundary.|$|E
5|$|Various {{parts of}} the main volcano have been {{subjected}} to hydrothermal alteration. The Azufrera stage edifice was subject to the most alteration; especially in the summit area and between the Angulo and Azufrera summits lie sulfur rich talus deposits. The central part of the complex is heavily altered by fumarole activity. Hydrothermal alteration may <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> by the formation of a deep magma reservoir and resulting hydrothermal circulation in overlying rocks.|$|E
5|$|Although some {{preparatory work}} was carried out, the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939 brought the electrification north of Rickmansworth to a halt. First class travel was abandoned by the LPTB, along with the Pullman cars, and the line was operated entirely as a shuttle service. In 1940 the Chesham branch was converted to autotrain working, in which the trains could <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> from each end, thus avoiding the time-consuming repositioning of the locomotive. LNER C13 Class locomotives were used for this push-pull working, along with two three-car sets of antiquated Ashbury passenger cars dating from 1898.|$|E
50|$|Four {{cars were}} entered for the 24 Heures du Mans of June 23 and 24 1962. Chassis 103 {{received}} number 53 and <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> {{by the team}} of André Guilhaudin and André Bertaut. Chassis 104 received number 54 and <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> by Pierre Lelong and Jean-Pierre Hanrioud. Chassis 105 received number 55 and <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> by Bernard Boyer and Guy Verrier. A car that {{is believed to have}} been chassis 102 received number 70 and was to have <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> by Robert Neyret and Robert Mougin but the car did not arrive.|$|R

5|$|Aspinall {{worked closely}} with Epstein, who {{provided}} weekly notes for Aspinall {{to give to the}} group's stage act, their concert appearances, and the fees they would receive. The Beatles had to travel in Aspinall's van along with their equipment, but British roads in the early 1960s were notoriously pot-holed and slow to navigate. Ringo Starr remembered that the travelling never seemed to stop during the early tours of Britain in Aspinall's van, as they would <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> up and down Great Britain with one of the group in the passenger seat, but with the other three on a hard bench seat in the back.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it was a}} {{self-contained}} section of the London Underground that was closed outside weekday peak hours, Aldwych station and the branch line from Holborn were popular locations for filming scenes set on the Tube even before their closure. Since the branch's closure in 1994, its use in film productions has continued, with the station appearing as itself and, with appropriate signage, as other stations on the network. The track and infrastructure are maintained in operational condition, and a train of ex-Northern line 1972 tube stock is permanently stabled on the branch. This train can <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> {{up and down the}} branch for filming. The physical connection with the Piccadilly line northbound tracks remains, but requires manual operation.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}} {{and construction of}} the park, many structures were added, redesigned or modified. These changes often resulted in budget increases. For example, the bandshell's proposed budget was $10.8million. When the elaborate, cantilevered Gehry design required extra pilings to <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> into the bedrock to support the added weight, {{the cost of the}} bandshell eventually spiraled to $60.3million. The cost of the park, as itemized in the following table, amounted to almost $500million.|$|E

40|$|A flow {{model of}} labor market {{participation}} {{is used to}} describe how various exogenous variations jointly affect unemployment and participation and provides short-run identification restrictions of a structural VAR. In some countries, fast rising female participation {{may have had a}} moderate short- and medium-run impact on unemployment rates. A variance decomposition exercise indicates that, in Continental Europe, participation <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> in the short run by unemployment shocks, whereas in the USA, it <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by participation shocks (demography, immigration). Unemployment in Europe <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by participation shocks, whereas in the USA, it <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by unemployment shocks...|$|R

5|$|During the Mesozoic (245 to 66 {{million years}} ago) the {{conifers}} flourished and became adapted {{to live in}} all the major terrestrial habitats. Subsequently, the tree forms of flowering plants evolved during the Cretaceous period. These began to dominate the conifers during the Tertiary era (66 to 2 million years ago) when forests covered the globe. When the climate cooled 1.5 million years ago and {{the first of four}} ice ages occurred, the forests retreated as the ice advanced. In the interglacials, trees recolonised the land that had been covered by ice, only to <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> back again in the next ice age.|$|E
5|$|He {{planned to}} engage his two central armies with the Muslim centre {{in an effort}} to stall them while the main thrusts would be against the wings of the Muslim army, which would then either <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> away from the {{battlefield}} or pushed towards the centre. To observe the battlefield, Vahan had a large pavilion built behind his right wing with an Armenian bodyguard force. He ordered the army to prepare for the surprise attack.|$|E
5|$|Jaguar {{hoped to}} reach 220mph with the XJ220, mainly for promotional reasons. The {{decision}} was made to undertake further high speed testing in June 1992 at the Nardò Ring in Italy, with Jaguar taking journalists from Road & Track and Car magazines together with a film crew from BBC Top Gear. The XJ220 would <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> by Martin Brundle, who had won the 1990 24 Hours of Le Mans driving the Jaguar XJR-12.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} recordings of vampire activity came from the region of Istria in modern Croatia, in 1672. Local reports cited the local vampire Giure Grando of the village Khring near Tinjan {{as the cause of}} panic among the villagers. A former peasant, Guire died in 1656; however, local villagers claimed he returned from the dead and began drinking blood from the people and sexually harassing his widow. The village leader ordered a stake to <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> through his heart, but when the method failed to kill him, he was subsequently beheaded with better results.|$|E
5|$|The Belgians and French {{remained}} {{confused about}} {{what was expected of}} each other if or when, hostilities commenced. The Belgians were determined to hold the border fortifications along the Albert Canal and the Meuse, without withdrawing, until the French Army arrived to support them. Gamelin was not keen on pushing his Dyle plan that far. He was concerned that the Belgians would <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> out of their defences and would retreat to Antwerp, as in 1914. In fact, the Belgian divisions protecting the border were to withdraw and retreat southward to link up with French forces. This information was not given to Gamelin.|$|E
5|$|The filming in {{downtown}} Chicago {{was conducted on}} Sundays {{during the summer of}} 1979, and much of the downtown was cordoned off from the public. Costs for filming the largest scene in the city's history totaled $3.5 million. Permission was given after Belushi and Aykroyd offered to donate $50,000 to charity after filming. Although the Bluesmobile was allowed to <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> through the Daley Center lobby, special breakaway panes were temporarily substituted for the normal glass in the building. The speeding car caused $7,650 in damage to 35 granite paver stones and a bronze air grill in the building. Interior shots of the elevator, staircase, and assessor's office were all recreated in a film set for filming.|$|E
