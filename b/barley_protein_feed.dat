40|$|Session 6 : <b>Barley</b> <b>protein,</b> <b>feed</b> and foodFunctional {{genomics}} is {{a technology}} through which large sets of genes that influence a particular biological process are identified. Functional genomics comprises several sub-disciplines, including genomics, proteomics and metabolomics. The {{total number of}} genes in plant genomes lies somewhere {{in the range of}} 25, 000 to 40, 000. Thus, functional genomics technologies must be geared to high throughput data collection and high throughput analyses of gene structure and function. Additional specialised resources, including barley mutant libraries, barley DNA microarrays and high-density genetic maps of barley, represent critical support technologies. The technologies will be illustrated by reference to specific applications relating to malting and brewing performance, such as the biosynthesis of cell wall polysaccharides, and to productivity, where tolerance to a range of abiotic stresses is a key determinant of yield. Finally, the potential impacts and benefits of functional genomics research for the barley industry will be addressed. Where a gene controlling an important trait has been isolated, a diagnostic marker that is 100 % accurate in predicting the phenotype of the plants for the target trait could be used in high throughput screening of germplasm in breeding programs.

40|$|Pathogenesis-related {{proteins}} from intercellular fluid washings of stressed barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) {{leaves were}} analyzed {{to determine their}} binding to various water-insoluble polysaccharides. Three proteins (19, 16, and 15 kD) bound specifically to several water-insoluble β- 1, 3 -glucans. Binding of the <b>barley</b> <b>proteins</b> to pachyman occurred quickly at 22 °C at pH 5. 0, even {{in the presence of}} 0. 5 m NaCl, 0. 2 m urea, and 1 % (v/v) Triton X- 100. Bound <b>barley</b> <b>proteins</b> were released by acidic treatments or by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Acid-released <b>barley</b> <b>proteins</b> could bind again specifically and singly to pachyman. Water-soluble laminarin and carboxymethyl-pachyman competed for the binding of the <b>barley</b> <b>proteins</b> to pachyman. The N-terminal sequence of the 19 -kD barley β- 1, 3 -glucan-binding protein showed near identity to the <b>barley</b> seed <b>protein</b> BP-R and high homology to other thaumatin-like (TL) permatins. The 16 -kD <b>barley</b> <b>protein</b> was also homologous to TL proteins, whereas the 15 -kD <b>barley</b> <b>protein</b> N-terminal sequence was identical to the pathogenesis-related Hv- 1 TL <b>protein.</b> Antifungal <b>barley</b> <b>protein</b> BP-R and corn (Zea mays) zeamatin were isolated by binding to pachyman.

As {{a source of}} recombinant <b>barley</b> <b>proteins</b> we cloned cDNAs specific for filial tissues of developing barley seeds into an E. coli expression vector. By using robot technology, 21, 500 library clones were arrayed in microtiter plates and gridded onto high-density filters. Protein expressing clones were detected using an anti-RGS-His 6 antibody and rearrayed into a sublibrary of 4100 clones. All of these clones were sequenced from the 5 ′-end and the sequences were analysed by homology searches against protein databases. Based on these results we selected 768 clones expressing different <b>barley</b> <b>proteins</b> for protein purification. The purified proteins were robotically arrayed onto FASTTM slides. The generated protein microarrays were incubated with an expression library-derived barley CK 2 small alpha, Greek {{in the presence of}} [small gamma, Greek- 33 P]ATP, and signals were detected by X-ray film or phosphor imager.

40|$|As world population, {{per capita}} income and {{urbanization}} increase, consumption of meat, poultry, milk and eggs will continue to rise {{to meet the needs}} of approximately nine billion people in 2050. Global beef, pig and chicken production and per capita consumption increased between 2000 and 2010, with growth in broiler production and consumption outpacing both beef and swine. The increased production and consumption requires readily available feed ingredients in regions where animal production is rapidly developing. Animal-based <b>protein</b> <b>feed</b> ingredients are often difficult to move from country to country due to real or perceived risk of animal disease. Zoosanitary standards can restrict the trade and availability of animal-based <b>protein</b> <b>feed</b> ingredients, which provide a viable source of protein, fat, and essential minerals.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Currently, feeding the ICU patient is highly discussed. Energy feeding {{has been the}} topic of {{randomized}} studies, but <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> has not. Study results are contradictory on early feeding; however, {{little is known about}} early protein requirement. What is this protein requirement based on, therefore what are the fundamental determinants? Recent findings Recent studies have addressed the importance of <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> and/or muscle (<b>protein)</b> wasting in critically ill patients. Targeted feeding has been shown to improve protein balance in one study, and infection rate in one study. Low muscle mass that is already present during ICU admission {{has been shown to be}} related to higher mortality, in two studies. Four studies have related muscle wasting to (<b>protein)</b> <b>feeding</b> strategies with very diverse results: Two small studies have reported no advantage [nâ€Š=â€Š 15, computed tomography] or negative impact (nâ€Š=â€Š 62, ultrasound, 50 % sepsis patients) of protein on muscle wasting. Two studies, one small (nâ€Š=â€Š 33, computed tomography) and one very large (nâ€Š=â€Š 1372, Subjective Global Assessment), have reported a positive impact of (early) feeding on muscle wasting. Summary Fundamental to adequate <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> in critically ill patients, at least 1. 2 â€Šg protein/kg per day, is targeted energy feeding using indirect calorimetry. The level of protein requirement is related to fat free mass or muscle mass, which makes sex and BMI also relevant. Targeted early <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> is found to improve short-term outcome, reduction of muscle wasting and hospital mortality. Long-term outcome of <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> has not been studied. However, targeted <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> may be harmful in sepsis patients. Up to now, we lack biomarkers that provide caregivers with an instrument to increase <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> up to the individual protein requirement of the critically ill patient.

Low and high <b>protein</b> <b>feeds</b> were used, and both consisted of 30 % concentrate and 70 % grass silage (fresh matter basis). Both feeds contained similar amounts of energy, but the crude protein contents were 131 and 185 g/kg of dry matter (DM), respectively, for the low and high <b>protein</b> <b>feeds.</b> In a nutrient flow experiment with three cannulated lactating cows, the metabolizable protein yields of the low and high <b>protein</b> <b>feeds</b> were 75 and 114 g/kg of DM, respectively. Thirty-seven cows were divided into control groups for the low and high <b>protein</b> <b>feeds,</b> and a choice group had access to both the low and the high <b>protein</b> <b>feeds.</b> Intake of DM and milk yield by cows in the control group fed the high <b>protein</b> <b>feed</b> were higher than those by cows in the control group fed the low <b>protein</b> <b>feed,</b> but these measurements did not differ from those of cows in the choice group. Cows in the choice group consumed a mean of 683 g of high protein feed/kg of total intake, which differed from what would be considered random intake (500 g/kg total intake). Diet choice did not systematically change during the experiment and was not correlated with weeks in milk, milk yield, or milk protein output. We concluded that diet selection differed significantly from what would be considered random, which allowed cows in the choice group to perform well.

40|$|ABSTRACT Four egg-type pullet feeding {{systems were}} {{compared}} {{for the production}} of egg-type pullets. The dietary regimens consisted of either a step-down <b>protein,</b> high energy <b>feeding</b> program; a step-down protein, low energy program; a step-up protein, high energy program; or a step-up protein, low energy program. At 150 days of age all pullets were housed 2 birds per 25. 4 X 45. 7 cm laying cage and fed a standard layer diet (16 % protein). The experiment utilized 2880 birds grown on the floor in a conventional growing house. At 140 days of age, birds subjected to the step-up <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> programs were 82 g smaller in mean body weight, had higher mortality, and consumed less feed than the birds on the step-down <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> programs. Body weights at 140 days of age were 1. 17 and 1. 09 kg for the step-down and step-up feeding programs, respectively. Energy levels fed had no significant effect on pullet weight, feed consumed, or mortality to 140 days of age. During the laying phase, hens that had been on the step-down <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> program reached 50 % production 2. 0 days earlier than birds subjected to the step-up <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> program. Hen-day production for the step-down and step-up pullet feeding systems based on 308 days' records was 76. 09 and 76. 86 %, respectively.

40|$|Livestock {{farmers in}} Sweden usually grow feed grains for {{livestock}} but import <b>protein</b> <b>feed</b> from outside Sweden. Aside {{from the economic}} implications, some environmental issues are associated with this practice. We used life cycle assessment to evaluate the impact of local <b>protein</b> <b>feed</b> production on land use and greenhouse gas emissions, compared {{with the use of}} imported <b>protein</b> <b>feed,</b> for pig meat and dairy milk produced in Sweden. Our results showed that local production reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 4. 5 % and 12 %, respectively, for pigs and dairy cows. Land use for feed production in Sweden increased by 11 % for pigs and 25 % for dairy cows, but total land use decreased for pig production and increased for dairy milk production. Increased <b>protein</b> <b>feed</b> cultivation in Sweden decreased inputs needed for animal production and improved some ecological processes (e. g. nutrient recycling) of the farm systems. However, the differences in results between scenarios are relatively small and influenced to an extent by methodological choices such as co-product allocation. Moreover, it was difficult to assess the contribution of greenhouse emissions from land use change. The available accounting methods we applied did not adequately account for the potential land use changes and in some cases provided conflicting results. We conclude that local <b>protein</b> <b>feed</b> production presents an opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but at a cost of increasing land occupation in Sweden for feed production...|$|R
40|$|Soybean meal from South America is {{the most}} common <b>protein</b> <b>feed</b> used for animal {{production}} in Sweden. Production of soybean has negative effects on the environment and the transports from South America to Sweden causes considerable CO 2 emissions. Therefore it is a growing interest in locally produced <b>protein</b> <b>feed</b> in Sweden. <b>Protein</b> <b>feeds</b> that are possible to grow in Sweden are rapeseed, peas, faba beans and lupins. Those are adapted to the Nordic climate and are perfect to grow in cereal rotations. However, these <b>protein</b> <b>feeds</b> contain antinational substances (ANS) that cause problems like growth depression for growing- and finishing pigs, and therefore limit their use as animal feed. The most common ANS in those crops are glucosinolates, tannins, proteasinhibitors, alkaloids, lectins, saponins, vicin and convicin. Other <b>protein</b> rich <b>feed</b> {{that can be used in}} pig production is meal or pellets of lucerne, a common forage crop in Sweden, and byproducts from ethanol production like stillage or dried distillers’ grains with soluble. The problem with stillage is that the farm has to be located close to the factory due to expensive transports. It is possible to produce feed that meets the nutrient requirements of growing and finishing pigs from locally produced feedstuffs. But the feed will be more expensive than feeds including soybean, therefore the pork price has to be higher from pig grown on Swedish produced feed...|$|R
40|$|Hydrolysis of <b>barley</b> <b>proteins</b> into {{peptides}} and {{amino acids}} {{is one of}} the most important processes during barley germination. The degradation of the endosperm stored proteins facilitates water and enzyme movements, enhances modification, liberates starch granules and increases soluble amino nitrogen. Protease activity is the result of the activities of a mixture of exo- and endo-proteases. The <b>barley</b> <b>proteins</b> are initially solubilized by endo-proteases and the further by exo-proteases. Four classes of endo-proteases have been described: serine-proteases, cysteine-proteases, aspartic-proteases and metallo-proteases. The objective of this work was to develop a rapid and colorimetric enzymatic assay to determine the endo-proteolytic activity of the four endo-protease classes using two different substrates: azo-gelatin and azo-casein. Optimum conditions for the assays such as: pH,reaction time and temperature and absorbance scale were determined. Azo-gelatin presented several difficulties in standardizing an “in solution” assay. On the other hand, azo-casein allowed standardization of the assay for the four enzyme classes to produce consistent results.

40|$|The {{anabolic}} {{response of}} muscle to resistance exercise and <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> {{is influenced by}} multiple factors, including the timing of <b>protein</b> <b>feeding.</b> A common perception is that a 45 - 60 min post-exercise ‘anabolic window of opportunity' time frame exists, within which dietary protein must be consumed to achieve muscle anabolism (and ultimately muscle growth). In this review, we argue the importance of <b>feeding</b> <b>protein</b> immediately following exercise is not as critical as has been espoused. Indeed, muscle remains responsive to protein ingestion for at least 24 h post-exercise. On the other hand, given that <b>feeding</b> <b>protein</b> immediately post-exercise is unlikely to impair the muscle anabolic response, and could improve it, from a practical standpoint, we recommend athletes and exercisers consume some protein, as a meal or supplement, in the immediate period following resistance exercise...|$|R

Firstly, the study found the best production performances using 100 chicks (DOC) with average body weight of 36. 98 ± 5. 50 g/chick without differentitating their sex. Secondly, using 60 months old cocks, the study invetigated the best treatment wich has a good protein digestibility. The study used a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with five treatments namely P 0 =control feed (using factory feed), P 1 = 20 % of <b>protein</b> <b>feed,</b> P 2 = 19 % of <b>protein</b> <b>feed,</b> P 3 = 18 % of <b>protein</b> <b>feed,</b> and P 4 = 17 % of <b>protein</b> <b>feed.</b> Each treatment had 5 replications.

The {{results showed that the}} use of different <b>protein</b> levels in <b>feed</b> did not give significant differences (P> 0. 05) on feed consumption, water consumption, body weight gain, and FCR. The treatment that used 19 % of protein had the best value on weight gain. On the contrary, the results showed that decreasing levels of <b>protein</b> level on <b>feed</b> treatment had a highly significant effect (P< 0. 01) on protein digestibility.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the <b>protein</b> content of <b>feed</b> <b>barley</b> on the costs of feeding beef, dairy cattle, and swine in Montana is evaluated. A model of least-cost feed rations is {{constructed}} to analyze the marginal value of additional <b>protein</b> content in <b>feed</b> <b>barley.</b> The results indicate that increasing the <b>protein</b> content of <b>feed</b> <b>barley</b> above 12 % will not substantially increase the value of barley to feeders. This implies that the establishment and maintenance of a protein premium in the feed barley market would tend to result in lower average prices for feed barley because the feed value/protein relationship is concave and the market would be sustaining costs that the inherent value of the commodity could not support. Key words: <b>feed</b> <b>barley,</b> least-cost rations, <b>protein.</b> Farmers receive significant premiums for the protein content in wheat. Higher protein wheats generally bring a higher price than lower pro-tein wheats; this difference is commonly re-ferred to as a "protein premium. " On the other hand, in the malting barley market, a negative premium is paid for higher <b>protein</b> malting <b>barleys,</b> lower <b>protein</b> varieties being pre-ferred.

40|$|Associations between <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> and {{reproductive}} efficiency in the dairy cow are reviewed. Examination of published {{data indicated that}} reproductive responses assessed as days open, services per conception or conception rate following changes in <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> tend to be inconsistent. Discrepancies can arise due to between-study variations in experimental design, statistical analysis, sample population size, uterine health, cow age, parity, reproductive management or nutrient intake. Detri-mental effects on reproductive efficiency following periods of excessive <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> are often attributed to increases in tissue urea and ammonia oncentrations leading to impaired reproductive hysiology, modified endocrine function or exacerbated postpartum negative energy balance. Examination of data collected from Finnish dairy herds (n = 16 051) participating in the national milk recording scheme during 1993 indicated that milk production was maximised in herds fed diets containing 180 g crude protein/kg dry matter. In contrast, no consistent relationships were identified between increases in on-farm <b>protein</b> <b>feeding</b> necessary to secure higher milk production and herd reproductive efficiency assessed as calving interval, first service interval and number of inseminations per calving. Further examination of data derived from 5 437 herds within the National recording scheme indicated that on-farm reproductive efficiency was independent of large variations in the mean annual urea concentration of bulk tank milk. It is concluded that increases in the crude protein content of Finnish dairy cow rations from 150 to between 170 and 180 g/kg dry matter would allow improvements in milk production to be realised without leading to significant reductions in reproductive efficiency. ...|$|R
