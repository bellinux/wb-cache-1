5|$|Intubation may be {{necessary}} for a patient with decreased oxygen content and oxygen saturation of the blood caused when their breathing is inadequate (hypoventilation), suspended (apnea), or when the lungs are unable to sufficiently transfer gasses to the blood. Such patients, who may <b>be</b> <b>awake</b> and alert, are typically critically ill with a multisystem disease or multiple severe injuries. Examples of such conditions include cervical spine injury, multiple rib fractures, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or near-drowning. Specifically, intubation is considered if the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is less than 60millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) while breathing an inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) of 50% or greater. In patients with elevated arterial carbon dioxide, an arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) greater than 45mm Hg {{in the setting of}} acidemia would prompt intubation, especially if a series of measurements demonstrate a worsening respiratory acidosis. Regardless of the laboratory values, these guidelines are always interpreted in the clinical context.|$|E

25|$|Like all non-depolarising muscle relaxants, pancuronium has {{no effect}} on level of consciousness. Therefore, if the {{anaesthetic}} used is insufficient, the individual may <b>be</b> <b>awake</b> but unable to cry out or move due to the effect of the pancuronium. There have been several civil lawsuits alleging similar failures of adequate anaesthesia during general surgical procedures. These have been largely due to improper or insufficient dosages of anaesthetic in concert with normal dosages of muscle relaxants such as pancuronium.|$|E
25|$|Both {{general and}} {{regional}} anaesthesia (spinal, epidural or combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia) are acceptable for use during Caesarean section. Evidence {{does not show}} a difference between regional anaesthesia and general anaesthesia with respect to major outcomes in the mother or baby. Regional anaesthesia may be preferred as it allows the mother to <b>be</b> <b>awake</b> and interact immediately with her baby. Other advantages of regional anesthesia may include the absence of typical risks of general anesthesia: pulmonary aspiration (which has a relatively high incidence in patients undergoing anesthesia in late pregnancy) of gastric contents and esophageal intubation. However, one trial found no difference in satisfaction when general anaesthesia was compared with either spinal anaesthesia.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{research}} {{on the effects of}} excessive light on the human body suggests that a variety of adverse health effects may be caused by light pollution or excessive light exposure, and some lighting design textbooks use human health as an explicit criterion for proper interior lighting. Health effects of over-illumination or improper spectral composition of light may include: increased headache incidence, worker fatigue, medically defined stress, decrease in sexual function and increase in anxiety. Likewise, animal models have been studied demonstrating unavoidable light to produce adverse effect on mood and anxiety. For those who need to <b>be</b> <b>awake</b> at night, light at night also has an acute effect on alertness and mood.|$|E

25|$|Each year, about 400,000 people undergo {{brain mapping}} during neurosurgery. This {{procedure}} is often required {{for people with}} tumors or epilepsy that {{do not respond to}} medication. During this procedure, electrodes are placed on the brain to precisely identify the locations of structures and functional areas. Patients may <b>be</b> <b>awake</b> during neurosurgery and asked to perform certain tasks, such as moving fingers or repeating words. This is necessary so that surgeons can remove only the desired tissue while sparing other regions, such as critical movement or language regions. Removing too much brain tissue can cause permanent damage, while removing too little tissue can leave the underlying condition untreated and require additional neurosurgery. Thus, there is a strong need to improve both methods and systems to map the brain as effectively as possible.|$|E
500|$|... 2000 saw a new Pyramid Stage {{introduced}} {{as well as}} new features such as The Glade and The Leftfield. The festival was headlined by Chemical Brothers, Travis and David Bowie who played 30 years after his first appearance. The Pyramid Stage also hosted an unusual event on the Saturday morning, with the wedding of two festival-goers, who had written to the organisers asking for permission to get married there, taking place and conducted by actor Keith Allen in front {{of a small group of}} friends and any other festival-goers who still happened to <b>be</b> <b>awake.</b> This year also saw an estimated 250,000 people attend the festival (only 100,000 tickets were sold) due to gatecrashers. This led to public safety concerns and the local District Council refused any further licences until the problem was solved. [...] The organisers took 2001 off to devise anti-gatecrashing measures and secure the future of the festival, after the Roskilde Festival 2000 accident (though this was also a scheduled break, one which took place every five years from 1991, the year after the battle of Yeoman's Bridge, until the 2012 Olympics extended the five-year sequence from the planned 2011 rest year).

Some of the charges carry potential sentences of life imprisonment or the death penalty. Tsarnaev was judged to <b>be</b> <b>awake,</b> mentally competent, and lucid, and he responded to most questions by nodding. The judge asked him whether he was able to afford an attorney and he said no; he was represented by the Federal Public Defender's office.

2500|$|Another {{influence}} on Woolf was the American writer Henry David Thoreau, with Woolf {{writing in a}} 1917 essay that her aim as a writer was to follow Thoreau by capturing [...] "the moment, to burn always with this hard, gem-like flame" [...] while praising Thoreau for his statement [...] "The millions are awake enough for physical labor, but only one in hundreds of millions is awake enough to a poetic or divine life. To <b>be</b> <b>awake</b> is to be alive". Woolf praised Theoreau for his [...] "simplicity" [...] in finding [...] "a way for settling free the delicate and complicated machinery of the soul". Like Thoreau, Woolf {{believed that it was}} silence that set the mind free to really contemplate and understand the world. Both authors believed in a certain transcendental, mystical approach to life and writing, where even banal things could be capable of generating deep emotions if one had enough silence and {{the presence of mind to}} appreciate them. Woolf and Thoreau were both concerned with the difficulty of human relationships in the modern age.|$|E
2500|$|... "La bruxomanie" [...] (a French term, {{translates}} to bruxomania) was suggested by Marie Pietkiewics in 1907. In 1931, Frohman first {{coined the term}} bruxism. Occasionally recent medical publications will use the word bruxomania with bruxism, to denote specifically bruxism that occurs while awake; however, this term can be considered historical and the modern equivalent would <b>be</b> <b>awake</b> bruxism or diurnal bruxism. It {{has been shown that}} the type of research into bruxism has changed over time. Overall between 1966 and 2007, most of the research published was focused on occlusal adjustments and oral splints. Behavioral approaches in research declined from over 60% of publications in the period 1966–86 to about 10% in the period 1997–2007. In the 1960s, a periodontist named Sigurd Peder Ramfjord championed the theory that occlusal factors were responsible for bruxism. Generations of dentists were educated by this ideology in the prominent textbook on occlusion of the time, however therapy centered around removal of occlusal interference remained unsatisfactory. The belief among dentists that occlusion and bruxism are strongly related is still widespread, however the majority of researchers now disfavor malocclusion as the main etiologic factor in favor of a more multifactorial, biopsychosocial model of bruxism.|$|E

Please don't let Africa and your country down." [...] The talks, chaired by President Mwai Kibaki and attended by former President of Tanzania Benjamin Mkapa, who represented the African Union, were referred to as [...] "an opportunity that should neither be lost nor wasted" [...] by Obasanjo, who stated that [...] "A military solution is not an option. We appeal to your principles to make this dialogue a success." [...] Obasanjo went on to declare that the talks should accomplish a permanent cease-fire in eastern Congo, continued reinforcement of a corridor for humanitarian assistance in the region, and a lasting peace in Congo; he also praised the delegations for their efforts.
