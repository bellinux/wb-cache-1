40|$|Authentication {{and message}} {{integrity}} are essential {{building blocks for}} protocols of many security related verification processes like data origin authentication for valid software updates or device authentication. Critical embedded devices- like a <b>brake</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> in a car-must only accept updates from valid issuers. At {{the same time it}} is essential- for security and commercial reasons- to prove the authenticity of the device to other integrated systems to prevent product counterfeiting. The most widely used algorithms for digital signatures, RSA and ECDSA, depend on finite field engines. Many embedded devices are powered by 8 -bit microprocessors. On this platform the finite field engines either require costly coprocessors, or the implementations become very large and very slow. Hence the need for better methods is highly visible. One alternative to RSA and ECDSA is the Merkle signature scheme which provides digital signatures using hash functions only, without relying on any number theoretic assumptions. In this paper, we present an implementation of the Merkle signature scheme on an 8 -bit microprocessor. Our results prove that the Merkle signature scheme can provide very good timings and a higher degree of security compared to previous implementations of RSA and ECDSA, while maintaining a smaller code size...|$|E

We suggest a workflow model based on timed-arc Petri nets and study the founda-tional problems of soundness and strong (time-bounded) soundness. We explore the decidability of these problems and show, among others, that soundness is decidable for monotonic workflow nets while reachability is undecidable. For general timed-arc workflow nets soundness and strong soundness become undecidable, though we can design efficient verifica-tion algorithms for the subclass of bounded nets. Finally, we demonstrate the usability of our theory on the case studies of a <b>Brake</b> System <b>Control</b> <b>Unit</b> used in aircraft certification, the MPEG 2 encoding algorithm, and a blood transfusion workflow.

Earlier incidents included another JetBlue flight bound for New York City, a United Airlines flight into Chicago, and an America West flight into Columbus, Ohio. While some incidents were traced to faulty maintenance and denied as a design flaw by Airbus Industries, the manufacturer had issued maintenance advisories to A320 owners which were later mandated as Airworthiness Directives by American and French aviation authorities. Messier-Dowty, which manufactures nose gear assemblies for the A320, stated in an NTSB report in 2004 {{that part of the}} gear had been redesigned to prevent future problems, but at the time the redesign was awaiting approval.

40|$|The {{size and}} {{complexity}} of software in automotive systems have increased steadily over the last decades. Modern vehicles typically contain numerous electrical <b>control</b> <b>units</b> (ECUs), {{and more and more}} features require real-time interaction between several dedicated ECUs (e. g., gearbox, <b>brake</b> and engine <b>control</b> <b>units)</b> in order to perform their tasks. Since system safety and reliability must not be adversely affected by this increase in complexity, proper quality assurance is a must. Such quality assurance is often performed by testing the system in different levels of integration throughout the development process. However, the growth of complexity of the system under test aslo affects the testing, making it laborious, difficult and costly. This paper presents a novel method for efficient offline analysis of traces, which has been especially tailored for integration testing of automotive systems. The method exploits the recently defined concept of independent guarded assertion in order to formally describe the events that are relevant for the analysis as well as the expected behavior in those events. The offline analysis is implemented using a standard commercial model checker and has shown good performance in the conducted experiments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this work}} a dynamic control {{allocation}} approach is presented for an automotive vehicle yaw stabilization scheme. The stabilization strategy {{consists of a}} high level module that deals with the vehicle motion control objective (yaw rate reference generation and tracking), a low level module that handles the <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> for each wheel (longitudinal slip control and maximal tire-road friction parameter estimation) and an intermediate level dynamic control allocation module that generates the longitudinal slip reference for the low level <b>brake</b> <b>control</b> module and commands front wheel steering angle corrections. The control allocation design is such that the actual torque about the yaw axis tends to the desired torque calculated form the high level module, with desirable distribution of control forces satisfying actuator constraints and minimal control effort objectives. Conditions for uniform asymptotic stability are given for the case when the control allocation includes adaptation of the tire-road maximal friction coefficients, and the scheme has been implemented in a realistic non linear multi body vehicle simulation environment. The simulation cases show that the yaw control allocation strategy stabilizes the vehicle in extreme maneuvers where the non linear vehicle yaw dynamics otherwise (without active braking or active steering) becomes unstable {{in the sense of}} over- or under steering. The control allocation implementation is efficient and suitable for low cost automotive electronic <b>control</b> <b>units.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|A new {{cooperative}} <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> strategy (CBCS) {{is proposed}} for a parallel {{hybrid electric vehicle}} (HEV) with both a regenerative braking system and an antilock braking system (ABS) to achieve improved braking performance and energy regeneration. The braking system of the vehicle {{is based on a}} new method of HEV braking torque distribution that makes the antilock braking system work together with the regenerative braking system harmoniously. In the cooperative <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> strategy, a sliding mode controller (SMC) for ABS is designed to maintain the wheel slip within an optimal range by adjusting the hydraulic braking torque continuously; to reduce the chattering in SMC, a boundary-layer method with moderate tuning of a saturation function is also investigated; based on the wheel slip ratio, battery state of charge (SOC), and the motor speed, a fuzzy logic control strategy (FLC) is applied to adjust the regenerative braking torque dynamically. In order to evaluate the performance of the cooperative <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> strategy, the <b>braking</b> system model of a hybrid electric vehicle is built in MATLAB/SIMULINK.
