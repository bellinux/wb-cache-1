5|$|All {{anticoagulants}} {{are generally}} contraindicated {{in situations where}} the reduction in clotting that they cause might lead to serious and potentially life-threatening <b>bleeds.</b> This includes people with active bleeding conditions (such as gastrointestinal ulcers), or disease states with increased risk of bleeding e.g. low platelets, severe liver disease, uncontrolled hypertension. For patients undergoing surgery, treatment with anticoagulants is generally suspended. Similarly, spinal or lumbar puncture (e.g. spinal injections, epidurals, etc.) carry increased risk so treatment is suspended prior to these procedures.|$|E

The Bounty Hunter demands that Exley revert to his true form before he dies. Exley refuses and the Bounty Hunter then kills him. However, Exley miraculously <b>bleeds</b> red, human blood. Back in 1999, Mulder invites Scully to hit baseballs with him on an empty field.|$|E
30|$|Postsurgical <b>bleeding</b> was {{determined}} {{in both groups}} according to the WHO <b>bleeding</b> criteria: (grade 0) no <b>bleeding,</b> (grade 1) <b>bleeding</b> under the skin and petechial class, (grade 2) mild <b>bleeding,</b> (grade 3) gross <b>bleeding,</b> and (grade 4) mortal <b>bleeding</b> or annoying <b>bleeding</b> [33].|$|R
2500|$|One {{can get a}} clue as {{to whether}} <b>bleeding</b> is due to [...] a {{platelet}} disorder or a coagulation factor disorder by the characteristics and location of the <b>bleeding.</b> All of the following suggest platelet <b>bleeding,</b> not coagulation bleeding: the <b>bleeding</b> from a skin cut such as a razor nick is prompt and excessive, but can be controlled by pressure; spontaneous <b>bleeding</b> into the skin which causes a purplish stain named by its size: petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses; <b>bleeding</b> into mucous membranes causing <b>bleeding</b> gums, nose <b>bleed,</b> and gastrointestinal bleeding; menorrhagia; and intraretinal and intracranial <b>bleeding.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} <b>bleed</b> {{system design}} procedure {{is applied to}} a Mach 3. 5, axisymmetric, translating centerbody inlet. The design features a traveling centerbody <b>bleed</b> system with a ducting arrangement separating low-, medium-, and high-pressure <b>bleed.</b> Three forward plenums and nine throat plenums are installed on the centerbody to meet the <b>bleed</b> requirements in the started Mach range between 1. 6 and 3. 5. The cowl contains four stationary plenums, three for forward and one for throat <b>bleed.</b> To achieve maximum <b>bleed</b> plenum pressure and thereby minimize <b>bleed</b> drag all <b>bleed</b> holes are inclined 20 deg to the surface except in the cowl throat region. Here the requirement of high stability margin with minimum total pressure recovery penalty resulted in 90 deg <b>bleed</b> holes. The <b>bleed</b> hole diameter varies from <b>bleed</b> plenum to <b>bleed</b> plenum to achieve the most efficient boundary layer control, while the <b>bleed</b> exits are sized to operate at the highest possible plenum pressure without unchoking the <b>bleed</b> holes. <b>Bleed</b> flow rates, <b>bleed</b> plenum pressures, and boundary layer development along the cowl and centerbody are predicted over the entire started Mach range...|$|R

Todd pretends to forgive her and dances with her before hurling her into the bakehouse oven, then cradles Lucy's dead body in his arms. Toby appears, enraged at Mrs. Lovett's death, and Todd allows Toby to slit his throat with his own razor. Toby leaves as Todd <b>bleeds</b> to death over his dead wife.|$|E
5|$|Von Willebrand's {{disease is}} a {{hereditary}} bleeding disorder found in both dogs and humans. It {{is caused by a}} lack of von Willebrand factor which plays a role in the clotting process of blood. This can cause abnormal platelet function and prolonged bleeding times. Affected dogs can be prone to nose <b>bleeds,</b> and increased bleeding following trauma or surgery. There are three types of this condition with Type I being the most common, while Type II and III being rarer, but more severe. Type I von Willebrand's disease is relatively common in the Scottish Terrier.|$|E
5|$|After {{emerging}} from a manhole in the showers of the guard living quarters, Riddick uses a guard uniform to blend in {{as he makes his}} way to the space port and his chance at escape. Realizing he requires a guard to get through the retinal scanner that locks the doors to the space port, Riddick decides to go after Abbott and take his eyes. He gains access to Abbott's apartment by telling him there is a delivery for him. A fire fight ensues and after that, as Abbott <b>bleeds</b> out on the floor, Riddick moves in for the kill but is stopped by Johns.|$|E
50|$|Most unusual <b>bleeding</b> or {{irregular}} <b>bleeding</b> (metrorrhagia) in premenopausal {{women is}} caused by changes in the hormonal balance of the body. These changes are not pathological. Exceptionally heavy <b>bleeding</b> during menstruation is termed menorrhagia or hypermenorrhea, while light <b>bleeding</b> is called hypomenorrhea. Women on hormonal contraceptives can experience breakthrough <b>bleeding</b> and/or withdrawal <b>bleeding.</b> Withdrawal <b>bleeding</b> occurs when a hormonal contraceptive or other hormonal intake is discontinued.|$|R
2500|$|Dysfunctional uterine <b>bleeding</b> is a hormonally caused <b>bleeding</b> abnormality. [...] Dysfunctional uterine <b>bleeding</b> {{typically}} {{occurs in}} premenopausal {{women who do}} not ovulate normally (i.e. are anovulatory). All these <b>bleeding</b> abnormalities need medical attention; they may indicate hormone imbalances, uterine fibroids, or other problems. As pregnant women may <b>bleed,</b> a pregnancy test forms part of the evaluation of abnormal <b>bleeding.</b>|$|R

Available experimental <b>bleed</b> hole performance data, coupled with <b>bleed</b> drag calculations, show that holes with shallow inclination are superior to holes normal to the surface in terms of overall inlet performance. Recent test results from large-scale inlet models indicate that <b>bleed</b> hole size, <b>bleed</b> hole length, and {{boundary layer}} velocity profile upstream of the <b>bleed</b> region are important parameters {{in the design of}} an effective and efficient <b>bleed</b> system...|$|R
5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The mere fact that a defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker {{does not mean that the}} defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on the manner in which the weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker <b>bleeds</b> to death).|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus (synonym Lactarius piperatus), {{commonly}} known as the peppery milk-cap, is a semi-edible basidiomycete fungus of the genus Lactifluus. Despite being edible, it is not recommended by some because of its poor taste, though can be used as seasoning when dried. The fruiting body is a creamy-white mushroom which is funnel-shaped when mature, with exceptionally crowded gills. It <b>bleeds</b> a whitish peppery-tasting milk when cut. Widely distributed across Europe and eastern North America, Lactifluus piperatus has been accidentally introduced to Australia. Mycorrhizal, it forms a symbiotic relationship with various species of deciduous tree, including beech, and hazel, and fruiting bodies are found on the forest floor in deciduous woodland.|$|E
5|$|Food {{impaction}} {{occurs when}} food debris, especially fibrous food such as meat, becomes trapped between two teeth and is {{pushed into the}} gums during chewing. The usual cause of food impaction is disruption of the normal interproximal contour or drifting of teeth so that a gap is created (an open contact). Decay can lead to collapse of part of the tooth, or a dental restoration may not accurately reproduce the contact point. Irritation, localized discomfort or mild pain {{and a feeling of}} pressure from between the two teeth results. The gingival papilla is swollen, tender and <b>bleeds</b> when touched. The pain occurs during and after eating, and may slowly disappear before being evoked again at the next meal, or relieved immediately by using a tooth pick or dental floss in the involved area. A gingival or periodontal abscess may develop from this situation.|$|E
40|$|Although {{techniques}} and instruments for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) have improved, <b>bleeding</b> {{is still the}} most common complication. Minimizing the occurrence of <b>bleeding</b> is important because blood can interfere with subsequent procedures. Generally, ESD-related <b>bleeding</b> can be divided into intraprocedural and postprocedural bleedings. Postprocedural <b>bleeding</b> can be further classi-fied into early post-ESD <b>bleeding</b> which occurs within 48 hours after ESD and late post-ESD <b>bleeding</b> which occurs later than 48 hours after ESD. A basic principle for avoiding intraprocedural <b>bleeding</b> is to watch for vessels and coagulate them before cutting. Several countertraction devices have been designed to minimize intraprocedural <b>bleeding.</b> Methods for reducing postprocedural <b>bleeding</b> in-clude administration of proton-pump inhibitors or prophylactic coagulation after ESD. Medical adhesive spray such as n-butyl- 2 -cyano-acrylate is also an option for preventing postprocedural <b>bleeding.</b> Various endoscopic treatment modalities are used for both intraproce-dural and postprocedural <b>bleeding.</b> However, hemoclipping is infrequently used during ESD because the clips interfere with subsequent resection. <b>Bleeding</b> that occurs as a result of ESD can usually be managed easily. Nonetheless, more effective ways to prevent <b>bleeding,</b> including reliable ESD techniques, must be developed...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Obscure {{gastrointestinal}} (GI) <b>bleeding</b> {{is defined}} as persistent or recurrent GI <b>bleeding</b> after negative evaluations with upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. Accounts for approximately 5 % of GI <b>bleeding.</b> Obscure GI <b>bleeding</b> can further be classified as being overt or occult. -Overt GI <b>bleeding</b> is clinically evident, with either hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena. -Occult GI <b>bleeding</b> manifests as iron deficiency anemia or a positive fecal occult blood test. Our case demonstrates a rare cause of obscure occult GI <b>bleeding...</b>|$|R
5|$|Aspirin {{can cause}} {{prolonged}} <b>bleeding</b> after operations {{for up to}} 10 days. In one study, 30 of 6499 people having elective surgery required reoperations to control <b>bleeding.</b> Twenty had diffuse <b>bleeding</b> and 10 had <b>bleeding</b> from a site. Diffuse, but not discrete, <b>bleeding</b> {{was associated with the}} preoperative use of aspirin alone or in combination with other NSAIDS in 19 of the 20 diffuse <b>bleeding</b> people.|$|R
5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in a person's {{disposition}} to SAH; risk is increased three- to fivefold in first-degree relatives of people having had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, lifestyle factors are more important in determining overall risk. These risk factors are smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), and excessive alcohol consumption. Having smoked in the past confers a doubled risk of SAH compared to those who have never smoked. Some protection of uncertain significance is conferred by caucasian ethnicity, hormone replacement therapy, and diabetes mellitus. There is likely an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol and the risk of non-traumatic SAH, though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies. Approximately 4 percent of aneurysmal <b>bleeds</b> occur after sexual intercourse and 10 percent of people with SAH are bending over or lifting heavy objects at the onset of their symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Giraffes were {{probably}} common targets for hunters throughout Africa. Different {{parts of their}} bodies were used for different purposes. Their meat was used for food. The tail hairs served as flyswatters, bracelets, necklaces and thread. Shields, sandals and drums were made using the skin, and the strings of musical instruments were from the tendons. The smoke from burning giraffe skins {{was used by the}} medicine men of Buganda to treat nose <b>bleeds.</b> The Humr people of Sudan consume the drink Umm Nyolokh; which is created from the liver and marrow of giraffes. Umm Nyolokh often contains DMT and other psychoactive substances from plants the giraffes eat such as Acacia; and is known to cause hallucinations of giraffes, believed to be the giraffes' ghosts by the Humr. In the 19th century, European explorers began to hunt them for sport. Habitat destruction has hurt the giraffe, too: in the Sahel, the need for firewood and grazing room for livestock has led to deforestation. Normally, giraffes can coexist with livestock, since they do not directly compete with them.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally a Portia {{is killed}} or injured while {{pursuing}} prey up to twice Portia′s size. In tests, P. schultzi is killed in 1.7% of pursuits and injured but not killed in 5.3%, P. labiata is killed in 2.1% and injured but not killed in 3.9%, and P. fimbriata in Queensland is killed in 0.06% of its pursuits and injured but not killed in another 0.06%. A Portia′s especially tough skin often prevents injury, even when its body {{is caught in}} the other spider's fangs. When injured, Portia <b>bleeds</b> and may sometimes loses one or more legs. Spiders' palps and legs break off easily when attacked, Portia′s palps and legs break off exceptionally easily, which may be a defence mechanism, and Portias are often seen with missing legs or palps, while other salticids in the same habitat are not seen with missing legs or palps.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{patterns of}} clinical <b>bleeding</b> in neonates with severe thrombocytopenia (ST and platelet count < 60 × 10 (9) L(- 1)), and {{to investigate the}} factors related to <b>bleeding.</b> STUDY DESIGN: Seven tertiary-level neonatal units enrolled neonates (n = 169) with ST. Data were collected prospectively on all clinically apparent haemorrhages. Relationships between <b>bleeding,</b> platelet count and baseline characteristics were explored through regression analysis. RESULTS: <b>Bleeding</b> was recorded in most neonates with ST (138 / 169; 82 %), including 123 neonates with minor <b>bleeding</b> and 15 neonates with major <b>bleeding.</b> The most common sites of minor <b>bleeding</b> were from the renal tract (haematuria 40 %), endotracheal tube (21 %), nasogastric tube (10 %) and skin (15 %). Gestational age < 34 weeks, development of ST within 10 days of birth and necrotizing enterocolitis were the strongest predictors for an increased number of <b>bleeding</b> events. For neonates with ST, a lower platelet count was not a strong predictor of increased <b>bleeding.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The majority of neonates with ST <b>bleed,</b> although most episodes are minor. These findings establish the importance of clinical factors for <b>bleeding</b> risk, rather than minimum platelet count. Further studies should assess the clinical significance {{of different types of}} minor <b>bleed</b> for neonatal outcomes, the predictive value of minor <b>bleeding</b> for major <b>bleeding</b> and the role of platelet transfusions in preventing <b>bleeding...</b>|$|R

5|$|Shelly becomes possessed as well, forcing Scotty {{to chop up}} {{her body}} with an axe and bury the remains. Shaken by the experience, he leaves {{to find a way}} back to town. When Ash goes to check on Linda, he is horrified to find that she has already begun to turn. A badly-injured Scotty {{staggers}} into the cabin and dies of his wounds, having been attacked by the trees. While Ash tries {{to figure out what to}} do, both Linda and Cheryl pretend to be cured, only to quickly revert to their demonic forms. Ash locks Linda outside, but she returns and tries to stab him before he impales her with a dagger. He tries to cut up her remains with a chainsaw, but can't bring himself to do so, and ends up burying her instead. When he reaches for her necklace on the ground, she escapes again trying to kill him. Ash decapitates her with a shovel, and her headless body <b>bleeds</b> all over Ash's face as it tries to rape him before he escapes. Back in the cabin, he quickly realizes that Cheryl has forced open the trapdoor. After wounding her with a shotgun, he heads to the basement for more ammunition. There, the entity tortures him by dousing him with blood from a pipe, while more blood seeps from the walls and ceilings.|$|E
25|$|Colonoscopy {{is useful}} for the {{diagnosis}} and treatment of lower GI bleeding. A number of techniques may be employed including: clipping, cauterizing, and sclerotherapy. Preparation for colonoscopy takes a minimum of six hours which in those bleeding briskly may limit its applicability. Surgery, while rarely used to treat upper GI <b>bleeds,</b> is still commonly used to manage lower GI <b>bleeds</b> by cutting out the part of the intestines that is causing the problem. Angiographic embolization may be used for both upper and lower GI <b>bleeds.</b> Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) may also be considered.|$|E
25|$|Acute <b>bleeds</b> often develop {{after high}} speed {{acceleration}} or deceleration injuries and are increasingly severe with larger hematomas. They are most severe if associated with cerebral contusions. Though {{much faster than}} chronic subdural <b>bleeds,</b> acute subdural bleeding is usually venous and therefore slower than the typically arterial bleeding of an epidural hemorrhage. Acute subdural <b>bleeds</b> have a high mortality rate, higher even than epidural hematomas and diffuse brain injuries, because the force (acceleration/deceleration) required to cause them causes other severe injuries as well. The mortality rate associated with acute subdural hematoma is around 60 to 80%.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{describe}} the incidence, location {{and management of}} non-major <b>bleeding,</b> and assess the association between non-major <b>bleeding</b> and clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) receiving anticoagulation therapy enrolled in Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE). METHODS: We included patients who received >/= 1 dose of study drug (n= 18 140). Non-major <b>bleeding</b> {{was defined as the}} first <b>bleeding</b> event considered to be clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) or minor <b>bleeding,</b> and not preceded by a major <b>bleeding</b> event. RESULTS: Non-major <b>bleeding</b> was three times more common than major <b>bleeding</b> (12. 1 % vs 3. 8 %). Like major <b>bleeding,</b> non-major <b>bleeding</b> was less frequent with apixaban (6. 4 per 100 patient-years) than warfarin (9. 4 per 100 patient-years) (adjusted HR 0. 69, 95 % CI 0. 63 to 0. 75). The most frequent sites of non-major <b>bleeding</b> were haematuria (16. 4 %), epistaxis (14. 8 %), gastrointestinal (13. 3 %), haematoma (11. 5 %) and bruising/ecchymosis (10. 1 %). Medical or surgical intervention was similar among patients with non-major <b>bleeding</b> on warfarin versus apixaban (24. 7 % vs 24. 5 %). A change in antithrombotic therapy (58. 6 % vs 50. 0 %) and permanent study drug discontinuation (5. 1 % (61) vs 3. 6 % (30), p= 0. 10) was numerically higher with warfarin than apixaban.
