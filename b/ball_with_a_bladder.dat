5000|$|Around 1854 at Rugby School, {{the ball}} was kicked high in the air, dropped down a disused chimney and was lost behind wooden panels {{for over a century}} and a half. A hybrid 7-panel ButtonBall, made before the split between the Rugby Football Union and Football Association, it is the world's oldest known [...] "template" [...] <b>ball,</b> {{inflated}} <b>with</b> <b>an</b> India-rubber <b>bladder</b> which revolutionised ball manufacture and allowed the spread of the game throughout the world. It is the only original known to survive. This Punt-about ButtonBall holds the remains of one of Richard Lindon's India Rubber inflatable bladders and resembles the shape of the earliest plum rugby ball. The [...] "panel and button" [...] design led to the creation the first soccer balls.|$|R
5000|$|The modern game {{originated}} in the late 19th century {{as a form of}} rugby football, played in rivers in England and Scotland, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small 3 to 4 inch ball constructed of rubber imported from colonial plantations in India. This [...] "water rugby" [...] came to be called [...] "water polo" [...] based on the English pronunciation of the Balti word for ball, pulu. The original ball soon gave way to a football (soccer ball), which allowed for passing and swimming above water <b>with</b> the <b>ball.</b> However, the leather football absorbed water and became extremely heavy, slippery and out-of-control when wet. In 1936, James R. ("Jimmy") Smith, California water polo coach and {{author of several books on}} water polo mechanics, developed <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> made <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inflatable <b>bladder</b> and <b>a</b> rubber fabric cover, which improved performance. [...] The new ball was red, but by 1948 yellow was adopted for better visibility by players. It became the official FINA and Olympic ball in 1956.|$|R
5000|$|Over the years, both {{technical}} and rule changes affected {{the character of}} the game. In 1928, Hungarian water polo coach Béla Komjádi invented the [...] "air pass," [...] or [...] "dry pass", a technique in which a player directly passes the ball through the air to another player, who receives it without the ball hitting the water. Previously, players would let the ball drop in the water first and then reach out for it, but the dry pass made the offensive game more dynamic, and contributed to Hungarian dominance of water polo for 60 years. In 1936, James R. ("Jimmy") Smith, California water polo coach and {{author of several books on}} water polo mechanics, developed a water polo <b>ball</b> made <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inflatable <b>bladder</b> and <b>a</b> rubber fabric cover, which improved performance. The previous leather ball absorbed water and became heavier during the game. In 1949, rule changes allowed play to continue uninterrupted after a referee whistled an ordinary foul, speeding up play. In the 1970s, the exclusion foul replaced a point system for major fouls; players guilty of this foul were excluded for a 1-minute penalty and their team forced to play with fewer players. Possession of the ball was limited to 45 seconds before a scoring attempt. Time of penalties and possession has been reduced since then. The direct shot on goal from the seven (7) meter line after a free throw was allowed in 1994, and changed to a five-meter shot in 2005.|$|R
