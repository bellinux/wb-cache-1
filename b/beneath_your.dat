Bold France, taught by experience, has quailed <b>beneath</b> <b>your</b> valour, fierce England, led captive, has submitted to you; rich Apulia, on having you for her masters, has flourished once again; Jerusalem so famed, and illustrious Antioch, have bowed themselves before you; and now Scotland, which of right is subject to you, attempts to show resistance, displaying a temerity not warranted by her arms, more fitted indeed for rioting than for battle. These are people, in fact, who have no knowledge of military matters, no skill in fighting, no moderation in ruling. There is no room then left for fear, but rather for shame, that those whom we have always sought on their own soil and overcome [...].have ...come flocking into our country." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Atlanta {{acoustic}} {{music scene}} {{at the time was}} split between the Trackside and The Freight Room. [...] When The Freight Room closed in 1992, Conoscenti, Wilcox, and most of Atlanta's other notable musicians like The Indigo Girls, Shawn Mullins, Kristian Bush, and others moved to Eddie's Attic. His first record, Carved in Stone on the DB Records label was released that year, followed by <b>Beneath</b> <b>Your</b> Moon. In 1994, he met Ellis Paul at Eddie's, and the two have been close friends and collaborators since. Conoscenti frequently plays guitar at Paul's shows around the country, including accompanying Paul for many years at his traditional New Year's Eve shows at Club Passim in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Conoscenti left Atlanta that year and toured the country almost continuously until 2004. [...] During that time he released Boxes of Bones, My Brilliant Masterpiece, One for the Road, Mysterious Light, Paradox of Grace, Extremely Live at Eddie's Attic, and Turn Here. Mysterious Light climbed into the top 20 albums played by folk and acoustic DJs worldwide. In his review of My Brilliant Masterpiece for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange, Shawn Linderman said: [...] "Weaving in and out of love from both directions, touching on friendships and loss, Don Conoscenti's latest solo acoustic work is cozy and warm. But don't be misled into thinking these tunes are slow and simple. Don can be blistering away on guitar, stretching his vocal range to its limits and interspersing wild wails and growls, and yet the song still comes across as comforting. Don't ask me how he does it-- that's what's so damned fascinating about his music!" ...|$|E

5000|$|As this fruit was divinely {{sweet and}} was {{infinitely}} delicious {{compared to the}} previous one, her husband inquired as to how Ammaiyar obtained this mango. Since her husband was not a proper devotee, Ammaiyaar was afraid of revealing the God's grace. The rule is that God's grace should not be revealed to non-devotees. But {{there is one more}} rule that when a husband is asking something,the wife has to truthfully answer his questions. Subsequently,Ammaiyar worshiped Lord's feet and revealed the truth to her husband. Her husband didn't believe it. He asked her to show another mango with divine help. Ammaiyar prayed to Lord Shiva for another mango and Ammaiyar prayed Lord Shiva for that. Immediately Lord Shiva gave her a similar mango,which she gave it to her husband. The mango then disappeared, and Paramathathan realised the divine nature of his wife. Paramathathan understood that Ammaiyar was worthy of worship and Ammaiyar cannot be treated as his wife. He then deserted Ammaiyar, becoming a trader and married the daughter of a merchant who then gave birth to their child. Paramathathan named the child with the real name of Ammaiyar. When the word reached ammaiyar's family, they decided that they must take her to him. When he saw his former wife, Paramathathan addressed her reverentially, saying that he realised Ammaiyar was no ordinary human being. He worshipped Ammaiyaar with his wife and child. Ammaiyar prayed to Lord Shiva asking for a boon — that Ammaiyar may worship Lord Shiva as a disembodied wraith. Ammaiyar received the boon, and leaving all her beauty and her body behind. Then Ammaiyar graciously sang, [...] "Arpudha Thiruvandhaadhi" [...] and [...] "Thiru Irattai Mani Maalai". Ammaiyar traveled to Mount Kailas, climbing it upside down on her head. There Goddess parvathi, wife of Shiva, asked about ammaiyar. Lord Shiva told, Ammaiyar is the mother who is taking care of ourselves. Ammaiyar worshiped shiva. shiva greeted her with calling her [...] "Ammaiye"(means, 'my mother!'), and Ammaiyar replied [...] "Appa"(father to all). Lord asked her wish to which Ammaiyar replied, [...] "I want endless and delightful love with you. I don't want to be born again. Even if I have any birth, I should not forget you. When you perform your holy dance, I want to be <b>beneath</b> in <b>your</b> feet and I want to sing your praise in joy." [...] The Lord granted the boon and asked Ammaiyar to come to Thiruvalangadu, where He is performing one of the holy dances (oordhuva thandava). Ammaiyar visited Thiruvalangadu, walking on her holy head.Ammaiyar sang 'ThiruAalangaatu Mootha Thirupathigam 1' and 'ThiruAalangaatu Mootha Thirupathigam 2'.

6000|$|Now {{come the}} questions, WHY did Christ {{rise from the}} dead?--and HOW did he rise? And, first, I will {{say a few words}} about how he rose from the dead. And this the Bible will answer for us, as it will every thing else about the spirit-world. Christ, says the Bible, was put to death in the flesh; but quickened, that is, brought to life, by the Spirit. Now what is the Spirit but the Lord and Giver of Life,--life of all sorts--life to the soul--life to the body-- life to the trees and plants around us? With that Spirit Christ is filled {{infinitely}} without measure; it is HIS Spirit. He is the Prince of Life; and the Spirit which gives life is His Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son. THEREFORE the gates of hell could not prevail against Him--THEREFORE the heavy grave-stone could not hold Him down--THEREFORE His flesh could not see corruption and decay as other bodies do; not because His body was different from other bodies in its substance, but because HE was filled, body and soul, with the great Spirit of Life. For this is the great business of the Spirit of God, in all nature, to bring life out of death--new generations out of old. What says David? [...] "When Thou, O God, turnest away Thy face, things die and return again to the dust; when Thou lettest Thy breath (which is the same as Thy spirit) go forth, they are made, and Thou renewest the face of the earth." [...] This is the way that seeds, instead of rotting and perishing, spring up and become new plants--God breathes His spirit on them. The seeds must have heat, and damp, and darkness, and electricity, before they can sprout; but the heat, and damp, and darkness, do not make them sprout; they want something more to do that. A philosopher can find out exactly what a seed is made of, and he might make a seed of the proper materials, {{and put it in the}} ground, and electrify it--but would it grow? Not it. To grow it must have life--life from the fountain of life--from God's Spirit. All the philosophers in the world have never yet been able, among all the things which they have made, to make a single living thing--and say they never shall; because, put together all they will, still one thing is wanting-- LIFE, which God alone can give. Why do I say this? To shew you what God's Spirit is; to put you in mind that it is near you, above you, and <b>beneath</b> you, about <b>your</b> path in your daily walk. And also, to explain to you how Christ rose by that Spirit,--how your bodies, if you claim your share in Christ's Spirit, may rise by it too.|$|R

6000|$|Such {{was then}} the state of that county, and such I {{have reason to believe}} it to be at this moment. But whilst these outrages must be {{admitted}} to exist to an alarming extent, it cannot be denied that they have arisen from circumstances of the most unparalleled distress: the perseverance of these miserable men in their proceedings tends to prove that nothing but absolute want could have driven a large, and once honest and industrious, body of the people, into the commission of excesses so hazardous to themselves, their families, and the community. At the time to which I allude, the town and county were burdened with large detachments of the military; the police was in motion, the magistrates assembled; yet all the movements, civil and military, had led to--nothing. Not a single instance had occurred of the apprehension of any real delinquent actually taken in the fact, against whom there existed legal evidence sufficient for conviction. But the police, however useless, were by no means idle: several notorious delinquents had been detected,--men, liable to conviction, on the clearest evidence, of the capital crime of poverty; men, who had been nefariously guilty of lawfully begetting several children, whom, thanks to the times! they were unable to maintain. Considerable injury has been done to the proprietors of the improved frames. These machines were to them an advantage, inasmuch as they superseded the necessity of employing a number of workmen, who were left in consequence to starve. By the adoption of one species of frame in particular, one man performed the work of many, and the superfluous labourers were thrown out of employment. Yet it is to be observed, that the work thus executed was inferior in quality; not marketable at home, and merely hurried over with a view to exportation. It was called, in the cant of the trade, by the name of [...] "Spider-work." [...] The rejected workmen, in the blindness of their ignorance, instead of rejoicing at these improvements in arts so beneficial to mankind, conceived themselves to be sacrificed to improvements in mechanism. In the foolishness of their hearts they imagined that the maintenance and well-doing of the industrious poor were objects of greater consequence than the enrichment of a few individuals by any improvement, in the implements of trade, which threw the workmen out of employment, and rendered the labourer unworthy of his hire. And it must be confessed that although the adoption of the enlarged machinery in that state of our commerce which the country once boasted might have been beneficial to the master without being detrimental to the servant; yet, in the present situation of our manufactures, rotting in warehouses, without a prospect of exportation, with the demand for work and workmen equally diminished, frames of this description tend materially to aggravate the distress and discontent of the disappointed sufferers. But the real cause of these distresses and consequent disturbances lies deeper. When we are told that these men are leagued together not only for the destruction of their own comfort, but of their very means of subsistence, can we forget that it is the bitter policy, the destructive warfare of the last eighteen years, which has destroyed their comfort, your comfort, all men's comfort? that policy, which, originating with [...] "great statesmen now no more," [...] has survived the dead to become a curse on the living, unto the third and fourth generation! These men never destroyed their looms till they were become useless, worse than useless; till they were become actual impediments to their exertions in obtaining their daily bread. Can you, then, wonder that in times like these, when bankruptcy, convicted fraud, and imputed felony are found in a station not far <b>beneath</b> that of <b>your</b> Lordships, the lowest, though once most useful portion of the people, should forget their duty in their distresses, and become only less guilty than one of their representatives? But while the exalted offender can find means to baffle the law, new capital punishments must be devised, new snares of death must be spread for the wretched mechanic, who is famished into guilt. These men were willing to dig, but the spade was in other hands: they were not ashamed to beg, but there was none to relieve them: their own means of subsistence were cut off, all other employments pre-occupied; and their excesses, however to be deplored and condemned, can hardly be subject of surprise.|$|R
