30|$|In our analysis, we used {{data from}} the Integrated Employment Biographies (IEB), which is an {{integrated}} German database {{that makes it possible}} to examine all cases of participation in employment and training programs that are offered by the Federal Employment Agency.

In addition, rich regional data on local labor market conditions and on local labor market policies could be controlled for in the evaluation context, which made the statistical matching approach a valid evaluation technique. The information collected at the individual level allowed us to capture qualifications and biographical information, which we related {{to the quality of the}} business project. Furthermore, the population itself and our data restrictions allowed us to focus on relatively homogeneously treated and untreated individuals, which improved our matching the Conditional Indepence Assumption (CIA).

40|$|In {{times of}} {{persistently}} high unemployment, labour market policy measures become increasingly important. Apart from traditional programmes such as continuous vocational training or re-education, the transition into self-employment is promoted in many industrialised countries. The {{aim is to}} shift {{people out of the}} unemployment status and to reduce the level of unemployment. In Germany, the transition from unemployment to self-employment is supported by the Federal Employment Services by so-called <b>bridging</b> <b>allowances.</b> Since August 1994, the conditions for receiving allowances were considerably eased, which led to a sharp {{increase in the number of}} people subsidised. In 1996, the transition of 90, 000 unemployed people into selfemployment was supported, compared to 25, 000 in 1993. A discussion of expected costs and benefits of self-employment gives reason to assume that the threshold of expected income at which a decision in favour of selfemployment is made is lower for unemployed people. Opportunity costs of business formation by unemployed persons probably lie below those of an employed person with the same endowment of human and financial capital, while the sunk costs migh...|$|R
40|$|The {{promotion}} of business start-ups by formerly unemployed individuals {{has become an}} increasingly important instrument of German {{active labour market policy}} (ALMP) in recent years. With the introduction of the start-up subsidy (Existenzgr) on 1. 1. 2003 unemployed individuals who wish to set up their own business have now two instruments at their disposal - the first one being the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> (). In 2004 more than 350, 000 people utilized either one of the two programmes, underpinning their importance within the set of ALMP instruments. In the context of the Hartz evaluation, we are assessing the two programmes with respect to their outreach and effectiveness. Our results show that both schemes help participants to avoid a return into unemployment. While this outcome is based on a sufficiently long observation period for the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance,</b> results are still preliminary for the start-up subsidy.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} of measuring a <b>bridge’s</b> characteristic <b>allowance</b> for dynamic interaction {{in the form}} of Assessment Dynamic Ratio. Using a Bridge Weigh-in-Motion system, measurements were taken at a bridge in Slovenia over 58 days. From the total observed traffic population, 5 -axle trucks were extracted and studied. The Bridge Weigh-in-Motion system inferred the static weights of the trucks, giving each measured event’s dynamic increment of load. Theoretical simulations were carried out using a 3 -dimensional vehicle model coupled with a bridge plate model, simulating a traffic population similar to the population measured at the site. These theoretical simulations varied those properties of the 5 -axle fleet that influence the dynamic response; simulating multiple sets of total (dynamic + static) responses for a single measured static strain response. Extrapolating the results of these theoretical simulations to a 50 -year Assessment Dynamic Ratio gives similar results to those obtained by extrapolating the data measured using the Bridge Weigh-in-Motion system. A study of the effect of Bridge Weigh-in-Motion system errors on the predictions of Assessment Dynamic Ratio is conducted, identifying a trend in the Bridge Weigh-in-Motion calculations of maximum static response.

30|$|During {{the early}} 2000 s, the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> {{was the most}} {{important}} program in the field of self-employment promotion in Germany. 6 Access to this program was limited to the unemployed or to individuals who were threatened by unemployment and sought to avoid unemployment by becoming self-employed. Furthermore, this program was only open to those who were entitled to unemployment benefits and only in cases in which the new venture would enable the individual to leave unemployment. Support was only granted for applications with a positive assessment of the business concept (e.g., a local chamber of commerce). Finally, the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> offered a subsidy comparable with the sum of the unemployment benefits and covered social security contributions {{for the first six months}} of the new business activity.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{instruments}} which was introduced with the 'Hartz-Reforms' was a start-up subsidy called Me Inc. ('Ich-AG'). This instrument was introduced {{in addition to the}} <b>Bridging</b> <b>Allowance</b> (") which had already been implemented in the 1980 s. Between 2003 and 2006 more than one million formerly unemployed were supported to set up their own business with these two schemes. Previous studies showed that both programmes rather complemented each other by attracting different target groups to start up their own business. Short- and medium-term prospects of both programmes were already evaluated positively within the evaluation of the 'Hartz-Reforms'; whereas long-term evidence could not be drawn due to the limited observation window. This study closes this research gap and provides evidence on the success of subsidized start-ups five years after foundation. It turns out that about 50 to 60 percent of former Me Inc. founders and 53 to 67 percent of <b>Bridging</b> <b>Allowance</b> participants are still full-/part-time self-employed at this time. With respect to labour market integration both schemes can be considered as effective: Throughout, we find higher employment rates for participants in comparison to other non-subsidized unemployed individuals; participants additionally achieve higher incomes.

30|$|To {{focus only}} on valid {{additional}} support the study uses time corridors as displayed in Fig.  4. Following this figure training, coaching and discretionary start-up support are included only if they lie within a certain time corridor {{in relation to the}} start date of the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance.</b> For simplicity the figure displays the number of the episode (I to IV) and the type of period (b[*]= before the start of bridging allowance; a[*]= after the start) as well as the time corridor to define the cut-off-point for including or excluding observations.

3000|$|The {{field of}} {{self-employment}} promotion in German active labor market policy was first addressed in 1986 {{in the form}} of a financial subsidy aimed at supporting the transition from unemployment to self-employment (known as ‘Überbrückungsgeld’: <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance).</b> During the mid- 1990 s, self-employment was promoted through a more generous <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance.</b> In the late 1990 s, the promotion of self-employment had been expanded in general. As for example, the implementation of Social Code Book III (SGB III) in 1998 led to a greater degree of managerial responsibility for local employment offices, as based on §  10 SGB III (discretionary measures of regional active labor market policy administered by local employment agencies; ‘Freie Förderung’). To a large extent, this greater degree of freedom was used to increase the promotion of self-employment at local levels. Second, in 1998, the active labor market policy of the Federal Employment Agency implemented a nationwide program as part of the national ESF funding. 3 Initially, this funding framework only focused on promoting general training programs, but it largely shifted toward promoting support for self-employment between 1998 and 2008.4 [...]...|$|E
30|$|Focusing on Germany, {{we found}} that {{promoting}} self-employment among the unemployed (only those who received financial support) increased substantially {{over the last decade}} to almost 25 [*]% of all new self-employment notifications (this varied between 20 [*]% and slightly above 30 [*]%, depending on which statistic was applied) in the early 2000 s. In total, the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> was the most important program for promoting self-employment entries in Germany (see also Wießner 2001; Reize 2004; Caliendo and Kritikos 2010).|$|E
30|$|Following the {{discussion}} above and {{the outline of}} self-employment promotion in Sect.  2, we first took {{a closer look at}} the regional variation in the relative relevance of the individual programs. Figure  2 illustrates the ratio between the number of participants in an additional support program (training, coaching or DSUS) and the total number of participants who received the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> for each of the 176 local labor market districts (note: the x-axis is based on the official identifiers of the local districts).|$|E
40|$|For {{almost one}} and a half decades now {{unemployed}} people who wish to become self-employed have been supported by the Employment Office by means of the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> (§ 57 Social Code III, previously § 55 a Employment Promotion Act). What was initially viewed sceptically and discussed quite controversially is today an important instrument of active labour market policy. What started out as 5, 576 people granted the allowance in 1986 had grown to 98, 114 people in 1999. The funding volume of the support programme also grew accordingly. At the same time the support from the Employment Office has gained considerable significance for the self-employment scene in Germany. For instance {{in the last two years}} almost one in five new business start-ups in Germany was realised with the aid of the Employment Office. Last year alone the Federal Employment Services spent some DM 1. 5 billion on supporting unemployed people who were prepared to become self-employed. This is reason enough to subject the effect and success of the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> to a critical appreciation. Impact research is absolutely essential for an effective and efficient allocation of resources from insurance funds, for the further development of the support instrument and finally also for deriving recommendations of action for the policy-makers. The primary aim of the IAB study was thus not only to obtain structural information about those receiving the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> but also to examine various success indicators both at individual level and at the macro-level of the labour market. In addition to this a further focus of the project was the causal-analytical examination of possible success factors. Key determinants here proved to be in particular start-up capital and business-specific human capital. The support of new businesses should start here, but without causing distortions of competition as a result of spontaneous interventions in the market structure.

30|$|Finally, an {{additional}} important factor supporting {{the argument that}} sufficient information was included in our data is that the major issue of selection was already absorbed by the decision {{to apply for the}} <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> (i.e., the motivation to start a business was already captured) and because specific data restrictions applied (see above). Because both groups—the treated and potential comparisons—entered self-employment in reality, most of the unobserved factors that govern an individual’s intention to start a venture should have been equally distributed in our study population. Therefore, we saw no fundamental aspect that would lead us to think this motivation would be different between the treated and untreated populations.|$|E
40|$|Support {{schemes for}} {{unemployed}} aiming for self-employment have been recently reformed several times. In 2003, the "start-up-subsidy" {{was added to}} the existing "bridging-allowance". In 2006 both instruments were merged to the "Gründungszuschuss". Since the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> has been evaluated as effective and efficient and the start-up-subsidy reached new target groups, the latest reform shows several short-comings. The design of the Gründungszuschuss is suboptimal, leading to efficiency losses if its participants act rational. It will also be less effective when compared to the two old programs. Overall, the recent dynamic development of new businesses will slow down more than necessary. Selbständigkeit, Gründung aus der Arbeitslosigkeit, finanzielle Förderung...|$|E
30|$|For {{the same}} reasons, people {{with more than}} three records of {{bridging}} allowances between 1999 and 2005 {{were excluded from the}} sample. Thus, we excluded episodes of bridging allowances that lasted for fewer than 60 days or more than 740 days. In cases in which there were two or three records of bridging allowances, we used the first observation as the reference. The reasons for this exclusion relate {{to the fact that it}} was not feasible to identify a valid start-up in these cases. For example, when people received a <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> for a very short period of time, we had to assume that these people did not have a true intention of starting a venture.|$|E
40|$|Five {{years after}} a {{business}} start-up, it becomes increasingly difficult to obtain information on the destination of people who set up businesses {{with the aid of}} the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance.</b> At an earlier stage of the project - after an average of three years of self-employment - it was still possible to obtain a response rate of nearly 90 per cent of the initial sample when questioning the people starting up businesses. Now, however, {{at the end of the}} study, it is not only the 'natural decline' in sample units - for example due to addresses that can no longer be investigated - which poses methodological problems for the analysis. Systematic biases occurred also as a result of the survey organisation. For the final telephone interviews were only carried out with those business founders who had signalled in the penultimate wave of the survey that they would be willing to take part in the survey again. This results in a positive bias which requires appropriate corrections. With the aid of a worst-case scenario, a restricted extrapolation, data comparisons and a weighting procedure, a 'corridor' was defined in which the 'true' survival rate of the former <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> recipients is most likely to range. According to that, at least one in two of the former unemployed people is still running his company a good five years after the start-up. All in all when comparing these findings with those of other surveys on start-ups, it can be stated that the outcome of the assisted start-ups is similar to that of start-ups initiated without the handicap of previous unemployment. Despite the remaining lack of clarity in the data stock and the growing difficulties in correcting these biases, the former <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> recipients still show a respectable balance - at least at gross level. It is not possible to make a statement regarding the net effects of the support programme as no appropriate control group is available. Also, when looking at the factors for success, little change can be detected over time. Just as two years before, the critical factors continue to be in the area of human capital and start-up capital. Whether further support programmes might provide sensible additional measures must be assessed by subsequent research. The various initiatives and offers that have been newly created over the past years can help to tap further potential for start-ups.

40|$|Sine 1986 the Federal Employment Service (Bundesanstalt fuer Arbeit) {{has used}} the socalied 'bridging allowance' (Ueberbrueckungsgeld) (Paragraph 57 Social Code III) to assist {{previously}} unemployed people in setting up their own businesses. This allowance is intended to guarantee the social security and subsistence of the person setting up the business during the start-up phase until the young enterprise has become consolidated - {{at least to some}} extent. Positive effects are expected for the labour market in two different respects. Firstly the person setting up the new business eases the strain on the unemployment insurance scheme with his/her step into self employnent. Secondly, if they are successful the newly established businesses may result in further employment impulses, thus contributing to the fight against unemployment. In the last three years alone {{about a quarter of a}} million previously unemployed people have set up their own businesses with the help of the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance.</b> Not least the finance volume of some DM one billion per year with which the Federal Employment Service has supported those setting up the businesses is a reason to examine the utilisation of these financial resources and at the same time to make an evaluation of the support instrument. At individual level the provisional appraisal of the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> so far is positive. About three years after setting up their own business a good 70 Prozent of those who received the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> are still self employed. A further 5 Prozent still do the work for which they received the financial support, but as a secondary activity. On the whole at present there is an average of one additional employee to each person who originally received financial support to start up a business. As regards the net effects of the support programme on the labour market or an effect on the econozny as a whole, it is not yet possible to make any adequately sound assessments with the present level of knowledge. It can, however, be shown that the success of the measure is impaired only slightly by deadweight effects. A large part of the resources is obviously being used in agreement with the objectives.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{estimate}} the effectiveness of two start-up programs (<b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> and start-up subsidy) in East Germany. Design/methodology/approach – Using a combination of administrative data from the Federal Employment Agency and a follow-up survey (for roughly 1, 300 / 1, 000 participants/non-participants), the analysis {{is based on the}} conditional independence assumption. Kernel matching estimators are applied to estimate the treatment effects and test the sensitivity of the results using a conditional difference-in-differences approach. Findings – At the end of the observation period both programs are effective: unemployment rates of participants are lower, and employment rates and personal income are higher when compared to non-participants. Additionally, first descriptive evidence of the additional employment effects through direct job creation is presented, which is quite significant for the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> and negligible for participants in the start-up subsidy. Research limitations/implications – Participants in the start-up subsidy are in their third year of participation {{at the end of the}} observation period and mostly still receive further support (although at a reduced rate). Therefore, the results for this program have to be treated as preliminary. Practical implications – In contrast to other active labor market programs that have been evaluated recently (including job-creation schemes and vocational training programs) this paper finds considerable positive effects for start-up subsidies. Hence, programs aimed at turning the unemployed into entrepreneurs may be a promising strategy in East Germany. Originality/value – This is one of the first studies that allows inferences to be drawn about the effectiveness of start-up programs in East Germany. Most previous studies on the effectiveness of active labour market policies in the Eastern part of Germany neglected these programs.

30|$|In August 2006, the German {{government}} re-organized {{the promotion}} of self-employment as part of active labor market policy and replaced the two existing programs, the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> („Überbrückungsgeld“, ÜG) and the start-up subsidy („Existenzgründungszuschuss“, ExGZ), by one single program, the new start-up subsidy („Gründungszuschuss“, GZ). Similar to the two former programs, the GZ also provides unemployed individuals financial support {{to start their own}} business, but eligibility criteria were more restrictive with respect to unemployment benefit entitlement and the subsidy was paid in two periods: During the first period (nine months) the unemployed individuals were allowed to keep their unemployment benefits and received an additional lump sum payment of 300 Euro/month to cover social security contributions.

Since the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> has been evaluated as effective and efficient and the start-up-subsidy reached new target groups, the latest reform shows several short-comings. First of all, an end of the start-up boom is to be expected with the newly attracted target groups not being reached anymore. Secondly, the design of the "start-up allowance" is suboptimal, where efficiency losses can be expected if participants aim at maximizing social transfers.

30|$|Note {{that our}} study {{addresses}} {{the combination of}} different support programs that promoted self-employment activities while concentrating {{on the outcome of}} programs that allowed for the inclusion of external expertise. We used the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> funding as a basic program to identify entries in self-employment. It is vital to note that this program ensures subsistence for everyday life during the first months of business activity. With respect to the total arrangement of self-employment promotion, this implies that the overall risk of financial distress during a new business’s start-up period is already relaxed. In contrast, the other programs can be characterized as different approaches that promoted the inclusion of external expertise for a new self-employment activity.

Note that for {{the interpretation of the}} ATT (Y 1), a positive sign is associated with a higher failure rate of the treated compared with those who only received the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance,</b> thus indicating a negative effect of the treatment on the likelihood of remaining self-employed. As column five shows, the ATTs (Y 1) were relatively low and, in most cases, remained statistically non-significant. In empirical terms, this finding indicates that (on average) the additional support did not contribute to increasing the duration of self-employment. However, our findings indicate {{that it is important to}} disentangle the different reasons for exiting self-employment because the treatment effects significantly differed for exits into employment positions vs. exits into unemployment.|$|E
40|$|Since 1986 the Federal Employment Services {{has used}} the {{so-called}} 'bridging allowance' to support previously unemployed people in setting up their own businesses. This allowance is intended to guarantee the social security and subsistence of the person setting up the business (and the members of his/her family) during the start-up phase, until the young enterprise has consolidated - at least to a reasonable degree. In general such assistance programmes are brought into being {{in order to create}} an alternative to unemployment in particular for qualified unemployed people - this alternative being selfemployment. This is intended to have positive effects for the labour market in two respects. Firstly the person setting up the business eases the strain on the unemployment insurance scheme with his/her step into self-employment. Secondly the newly established businesses may - if they are successful - result in further employment impulses and thus make an additional contribution to combating unemployment. In the last three years alone {{about a quarter of a}} million previously unemployed people have set up their own businesses with the help of the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance.</b> Not least the annual finance volume of some one billion Marks with which the Federal Employment Services have supported those setting up the businesses is a reason to examine the utilisation of these financial resources and at the same time to make a comprehensive evaluation of the assistance instrument. In the past decade the assistance programme, which has in the meantime been improved and made more convenient for those receiving the allowance, has already been scientifically examined by the Institute for Employment Research at the Federal Employment Services. The current research project follows people who became self-employed in the years 1994 / 1995 with the help of the Employment Office. The objective of the study is to obtain in particular information concerning the whereabouts of those who received the allowance, about additional employment impulses coming from the assisted business start-ups, about the (net) effect the assistance has had on the labour market as well as about the determinants of success. The provisional appraisal of the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> so far is positive. About three years after setting up businesses a good 70 % of those who received the <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> are still selfemployed. A further 5 % still do the work for which they received financial assistance, but as a secondary activity. On the whole at present there is an average of one employee for every person who originally received assistance to start up a business. Although it is still too early to regard the consolidation phase of the new enterprises as completed, anyone who survives the first three years has taken a major step in setting up a permanent self-employed business. This is also confirmed by the cautiously optimistic estimations of the future by the vast majority of those who remained in self-employment. As regards the net effects of the support programme on the labour market or any effect on the economy as a whole, it is not yet possible to make any adequately sound estimations with the present level of knowledge. It can, however, be shown that the success of the measure is impaired only slightly by deadweight effects. A large part of the resources is obviously used in agreement with the objectives.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{transition}} from unemployment to self-employment, which has become an important re-employment opportunity due to increasing subsidies during the last decade. The transition is subsidised with the so called <b>bridging</b> <b>allowance</b> (BA, “Überbrückungsgeld”) as part of active labour market policies in Germany. So far, {{there have been only}} few attempts to analyse the effects of BA on labour market success or income. The fundamental problem of every programme evaluation is that a participant is never observed in the case of non-participation. In this study I will address this problem by introducing the unemployed who move into paid-employment as a control group for those entering self-employment. On behalf of this comparison, the paper aims to identify, firstly, the determinants of self-employment among the unemployed, and secondly, the differences in employment duration among those entering self-employment and those entering paidemployment initially after unemployment. Thirdly, this paper demonstrates the effects of BA at the individual level {{on the basis of the}} first 14 waves of the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) covering the years from 1983 to 1996.
