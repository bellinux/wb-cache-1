500|$|Upon release, {{the song}} was {{generally}} met with positive reviews from music critics. Romanian publication Libertatea praised the refrain of [...] "Baby, It's OK" [...] for being optimistic, and described its beats as [...] "explosive". Jonathan Currinn, writing in his own website, expected the track to become a hit, although stating that the lyrics [...] "aren't exactly strong and Viper's solo in the song adds nothing. He has a unique voice but it's not something I can see myself listening to, he isn't a great singer, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> how his vocals change the track." [...] German portal Mix1 awarded [...] "Baby, It's OK" [...] with seven out of eight stars when reporting about its release.|$|E
500|$|... "Amber 31422" [...] was {{watched by}} an {{estimated}} 4.97 million viewers in the United States. The episode had a season low rating of 1.8/5 among viewers 18–49, which was down 10% {{from the previous}} episode that aired on October 14. Between Fringe and its lead-in show Bones, Fox finished in third place for the night. The Fringe episode's low ratings have been attributed by critics to the unexpected end to the 2010 World Series, which caused Fringe to air a week earlier than expected. Den of Geek columnist Billy Grifter attributed the low ratings to the parallel universe focus, commenting [...] "if you weren't a fan beforehand, you'll {{not be able to}} follow what's going on now. For those of us that did step onto the Fringe elevator early, it's a great ride, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> that it's a difficult proposition to attract new viewers." [...] Time shifted viewing increased the episode's ratings by 44 percent among adults, resulting in a rise from 1.8 to 2.6.|$|E
500|$|A {{compilation}} of Orbison's most successful songs updated and re-recorded {{was released in}} 1987 under the title In Dreams: The Greatest Hits. It coincided {{with the release of}} the dark and surreal mystery thriller Blue Velvet, [...] directed by David Lynch. Orbison was astonished at the way Lynch used [...] "In Dreams". In the film, a murderous and morally bankrupt psychopath named Frank Booth (played by Dennis Hopper) is obsessed with the song and demands it be played over and over, calling it [...] "Candy Colored Clown". In one scene it is lip-synced by a flamboyantly effeminate character played by Dean Stockwell, after which Booth becomes enraged and beats the protagonist. Lynch later stated, [...] "it is a beautiful song and it was written by Roy... Those lyrics, that feel meant something to him. And it just so happened that a song in a certain situation could mean something else. And the way that Frank Booth used that song in two different places, it is just kind of unbelievable. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> why Roy was upset because for him it meant a third thing." ...|$|E

500|$|Pamela and Bobby's {{relationship}} {{changed significantly}} {{as the show}} went on and began to progress. In order to create conflict, the producers brought in actors Priscilla Presley (Jenna Wade) and John Beck (Mark Graison) to cause drama for the couple. Eventually, the two characters divorced one another and went their separate ways. After becoming involved with Ewing oil, Bobby tended to put Pam on the backburner with the company coming first. In an interview with People, Principal said: [...] "I wouldn't {{put up with the}} way Pam is treated by Bobby." [...] She also added, [...] "Our marriage just doesn't work anymore and I want a divorce." [...] With the impending couple doomed, Pamela began a newfound relationship with Mark Graison (played by John Beck). The producers of Dallas were faced with the obstacle of getting the audience to root for a new love interest in Pam's life. When asked about the reception of his characters relationship with Pamela, Beck commented: [...] "It was always set up that way from the beginning, so it was quite a task and of course they came back together in the long run. I was just hoping for the best. I never got an extraordinary reaction from the public but it was everywhere, so constant recognition. It was pretty amazing but I never saw it the way he sees it <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> his point of view. I never really looked at it like that." ...|$|E
