5|$|In {{terms of}} Nigeria's major ethnic groups, the Hausa ethnic group (predominant in the north) {{was found to}} be 95% Muslim and 5% Christian, the Yoruba tribe (predominant in the west) was 55% Muslim, 35% Christian and 10% adherents of other religions, while the Igbos (predominant in the east) and the Ijaw (south) were 98% Christian, with 2% practising {{traditional}} religions. The middle belt of Nigeria contains the largest number of minority ethnic groups in Nigeria, who were found to <b>be</b> <b>mostly</b> Christians and members of traditional religions, with a small proportion of Muslims.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interest}} of transatlantic appeal, {{it was decided that}} the main characters would <b>be</b> <b>mostly</b> American and therefore actors capable of producing an appropriate accent were used. British, Canadian and Australian actors formed most of the voice cast; the only American involved was stage actor David Holliday, who was noticed in London's West End and given the part of Virgil Tracy. Following the completion of the first series, Holliday returned to the US. The character was voiced by English-Canadian actor Jeremy Wilkin for Thunderbirds Are Go, Series Two and Thunderbird 6.|$|E
5|$|Light showers {{from the}} {{precursor}} front skirted Bermuda prior to tropical development, with 24-hour precipitation totals {{of no more}} than 0.87 in (22mm) recorded on the territory. Moisture brought on by the storm from afar enhanced rainfall that ended months of dry conditions in Bermuda; 1.75 in (45mm) of precipitation fell at L.F. Wade International Airport on July 18, with an additional 1.6 in (40mm) recorded the next day. Although the rains proved to <b>be</b> <b>mostly</b> beneficial, minor flooding affected some local businesses in poor-drainage areas.|$|E

5|$|Lucas, who had {{previously}} confronted problems with the props used to depict R2-D2, allowed ILM and the production's British special effects department {{to create their own}} versions of the robot. Nine R2-D2 models were created; one was for actor Kenny Baker to be dropped into, seven were built by ILM and featured two wheelchair motors capable of moving , enabling it to run and <b>be</b> <b>mostly</b> used in stage sets, and the British studio produced a pneumatic R2-D2 that could shift from two to three legs and was mostly used in Tunisia because its motor drive system allowed it to drive over sand.|$|E
5|$|The east front {{looks more}} medieval {{than the other}} sides but {{probably}} dates from about 1900, however the south end cross-wing appears to <b>be</b> <b>mostly</b> sixteenth century. To {{the north of the}} house stands the well-preserved sixteenth century stable courtyard. This has timbered gabled dormer windows, and a tall clock-tower at the west side of its north range. These buildings have mullion windows, and Tudor arched-doorways. Also beside the courtyard are the brew house, one of the oldest in Britain, and the bakehouse. The two lodges are seventeenth century and the carriage-houses are eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{how long}} Surtsey will survive {{are based on the}} rate of erosion seen up to the present day. Assuming that the current rate does not change, the island will <b>be</b> <b>mostly</b> at or below sea level by 2100. However, the rate of erosion is likely to slow as the tougher core of the island is exposed: an {{assessment}} assuming that the rate of erosion will slow exponentially suggests that the island will survive for many centuries. An idea of what it will look like in the future is given by the other small islands in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, which formed {{in the same way as}} Surtsey several thousand years ago, and have eroded away substantially since they were formed.|$|E
50|$|The Albanian {{population}} is divided between Muslims (who <b>are</b> <b>mostly</b> Bektashi) and Christians (who <b>are</b> <b>mostly</b> Orthodox), {{and it is}} unclear which faith is larger overall. The Roma population <b>is</b> <b>mostly</b> Muslim, while the Greek population <b>is</b> <b>mostly</b> Orthodox Christian, and the Aromanian population <b>is</b> <b>mostly</b> Orthodox Christian. Many Albanian families are of mixed religious adherence, including the famous Frasheri family which has both Bektashi Muslim and Orthodox Christian branches. Today as {{in the rest of}} Albania, {{there are many people who}} don't observe any religion.|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace {{are usually not}} meant to be drunk young, but many are still best in the first years. Rieslings d'Alsace tend to <b>be</b> <b>mostly</b> very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very suitable for the late harvest Vendange Tardive and the botrytized Sélection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up the sweetness of the wine.|$|E
5|$|Lindow Man's {{last meal}} was {{preserved}} {{in his stomach}} and intestines and was analysed in some detail. It was hoped that investigations into {{the contents of the}} stomach would shed light on the contemporary diet, {{as was the case with}} Grauballe Man and Tollund Man in the 1950s. The analysis of the contents of the digestive system of bog bodies had become one of the principal endeavours of investigating such remains. Analysis of the grains present revealed his diet to <b>be</b> <b>mostly</b> of cereals. He probably ate slightly charred bread, although the burning may have had ritual significance rather than being an accident. Some mistletoe pollen was also found in the stomach, indicating that Lindow Man died in March or April.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals are omnivores {{and display}} {{varying degrees of}} carnivory and herbivory, {{generally}} leaning in favor of one more than the other. Since plants and meat are digested differently, there is a preference for one over the other, as in bears where some species may <b>be</b> <b>mostly</b> carnivorous and others mostly herbivorous. They are grouped into three categories: mesocarnivory (50-70% meat), hypercarnivory (70% and greater of meat), and hypocarnivory (50% or less of meat). The dentition of hypocarnivores consists of dull, triangular carnassial teeth meant for grinding food. Hypercarnivores, however, have conical teeth and sharp carnassials meant for slashing, {{and in some cases}} strong jaws for bone-crushing, {{as in the case of}} hyenas, allowing them to consume bones; some extinct groups, notably the Machairodontinae, had saber-shaped canines.|$|E

5|$|With the {{invention}} of the electron microscope in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll came the first images of viruses. In 1935 American biochemist and virologist Wendell Meredith Stanley examined the tobacco mosaic virus and found it to <b>be</b> <b>mostly</b> made from protein. A short time later, this virus was separated into protein and RNA parts. A problem for early scientists was {{that they did not know}} how to grow viruses without using live animals. The breakthrough came in 1931, when the American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs. Some viruses could not be grown in chickens' eggs, but this problem was solved in 1949 when John Franklin Enders, Thomas Huckle Weller and Frederick Chapman Robbins grew polio virus in cultures of living animal cells. Over 5,000 species of virus have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Each Surface overworld had a {{specific}} theme: the forest overworld revolved around landforms altering gameplay, the volcano overworld focused around {{changing the rules}} of gameplay, while the desert overworld was themed around duality between past and present. The first areas, the Sealed Grounds and Faron Woods, were created so players could be eased into the game's mechanics and navigation. While the forest areas were made to <b>be</b> <b>mostly</b> flat, the Eldin Volcano overworld was made with height differences in mind to provide a greater challenge. Elements in the volcano terrain included areas of lava, and slopes where Link's sprinting ability would become necessary for reaching new areas. For the Lanayru Desert, the team created three different overworld zones due to its unique time shifting mechanics, triggered with Time Shift stones: this shifting between different zones was inspired by similar systems in Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess. The portable Time Shift stones were one of many ideas included in the desert overworld as they did not fit with the forest or volcano environments. A difficult feature to include naturally was the remnants of Lanayru's Ancient Civilization, which used electricity to power both its technology and citizens. Enemy types that recurred in all Surface-based overworld areas were given slightly altered designs so they would be unique to each overworld. The Silent Realms were created as a new mechanic, filled with enemies {{that could not be}} defeated and relying on Link's sprinting ability rather than his weapons or items. While they had experimented with indestructible enemies in Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks, but this time it was changed by restricting Link's options and actions. They also created a time limit for added strategy, as knowledge of the areas where the Spirit Realms were located was key to completing them. This was also why they were set up in areas players would already be familiar with. They were originally in the form of special dungeons, but this was discarded in favor of the familiar areas.|$|E
