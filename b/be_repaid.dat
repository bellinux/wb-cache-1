5|$|By 301, {{however, the}} system was in trouble, {{strained}} by a new bout of inflation. Diocletian therefore issued his Edict on Coinage, an act re-tariffing all debts so that the nummus, the most common coin in circulation, would be worth half as much. In the edict, preserved in an inscription {{from the city of}} Aphrodisias in Caria (near Geyre, Turkey), it was declared that all debts contracted before 1 September 301 must <b>be</b> <b>repaid</b> at the old standards, while all debts contracted after that date would <b>be</b> <b>repaid</b> at the new standards. It appears that the edict was made in an attempt to preserve the current price of gold and to keep the Empire's coinage on silver, Rome's traditional metal currency. This edict risked giving further momentum to inflationary trends, as had happened after Aurelian's currency reforms. The government's response was to issue a price freeze.|$|E
5|$|Bryan urged {{a system}} of bank guarantees, so that depositors could <b>be</b> <b>repaid</b> if banks failed, but Taft opposed this, {{offering}} a postal savings system instead. The issue of prohibition of alcohol entered the campaign when in mid-September, Carrie Nation called on Taft and demanded to know his views. Taft and Roosevelt had agreed the party platform would take no position on the matter, and Nation left indignant, to allege that Taft was irreligious and against temperance. Taft, at Roosevelt's advice, ignored the issue.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Michael Bloomberg's December 12, 2006, {{address to}} the New York League of Conservation Voters noted that in November 2006, the {{government}} began issuing bonds to fund {{the extension of the}} 7 subway to Eleventh Avenue and 34th Street. The $2.4 billion extension was funded with New York City funds from municipal Tax Increment Financing (TIF) bond sales that are expected to <b>be</b> <b>repaid</b> with property tax revenues from future developments in areas served by the extension.|$|E
50|$|Zidisha's {{performance}} has varied by country. For loans disbursed {{within the year}} between June 2013 and June 2014, 81.1% of loans in Kenya have <b>been</b> <b>repaid</b> or <b>are</b> repaying on time, 93% of loans in Burkina Faso have <b>been</b> <b>repaid</b> or <b>are</b> repaying on time, 92.8% of loans in Niger have <b>been</b> <b>repaid</b> or <b>are</b> repaying on time, and 92.9% of loans in Indonesia have <b>been</b> <b>repaid</b> or <b>are</b> repaying on time.|$|R

50|$|One {{classic example}} of where a Migu does work is {{in the area of}} a loan {{repayment}} dispute. Where the lender accuses an alleged borrower of defaulting on an oral loan made without witnesses, the borrower may prevail in the case by claiming that the loan did occur, but that it had already <b>been</b> <b>repaid.</b> Normally, when one makes a claim that a loan has <b>been</b> <b>repaid,</b> he would <b>be</b> expected to produce evidence that it had <b>been</b> <b>repaid,</b> such as a receipt. However, in this scenario the borrower would prevail under the theory that he must be telling the truth, as if he were interested in lying to the court, he could have simply said that the loan never happened. Since the lender cannot prove the existence of the loan, that claim would have prevailed. Therefore, the claim that the loan <b>was</b> <b>repaid</b> <b>is</b> believed as well. This is a classic Migu, although many cases of Migu exist to support a position in court.|$|R
5|$|The bridge cost £1.5 million, {{as part of}} a wider {{road system}} costing £3.5 million. Construction on the bridge took 2 years and 5 months. It was officially opened by Governor Charles Gairdner on 13 November 1959. He {{unveiled}} a plaque on the bridge together with Premier Sir David Brand, Commissioner of Main Roads J. Digby Leach and Works Minister Wild. Gairdner was also the first person to drive across the new bridge. It was hoped at this stage that the debt raised to pay for the bridge would <b>be</b> <b>repaid</b> by the Government within 12 months.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{project cost}} NOK 910 million, of which NOK 513 {{was for the}} pontoon bridge, NOK 81 million was for the {{cable-stayed}} bridge, NOK 25 million {{was used for the}} waterway, NOK 115 million was used on planning, and NOK 176 million was used on auxiliary roads and the tunnel. The bridge was financed with NOK 41 million in state grants, NOK 139 million from tolls paid in advance, and NOK 730 million in debt which would <b>be</b> <b>repaid</b> by the tolls. Interest during construction cost NOK 138 million. The construction involved 1,150,000 man-hours.|$|E
5|$|The crisis {{point for}} the UERL was the need to redeem the five-year {{profit-sharing}} secured notes on 30 June 1908. The UERL {{did not have the}} money. Speyer unsuccessfully tried to persuade the London County Council (LCC) to inject £5million into the UERL and used some of his own bank's money to pay-off disgruntled shareholders threatening bankruptcy proceedings. Eventually, Speyer and Gibb managed to obtain agreement from the shareholders to convert the notes into long-term debt to <b>be</b> <b>repaid</b> in 1933 and 1948.|$|E

5|$|The post-millennium {{period has}} seen {{changes to the}} way the club is run as a {{business}}. When a new business management team was appointed {{at the start of the}} 2009–10 season, it inherited a business saddled with debt. The subsequent turnaround has resulted in operational profitability based on the disposal of non-core property assets, a new equity investment and a financial restructuring agreement with lenders for all debt to <b>be</b> <b>repaid</b> within five years. In 2016, the club reported that it was debt-free.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, {{the club}} {{decided that it}} would build a new 2,400-seat stand on the eastern long side. A low {{construction}} cost was secured because the construction industry {{was going through a}} slump. The costs were covered by NOK2.5 million in national lottery grants and NOK2 million in loan, which was planned to <b>be</b> <b>repaid</b> through increased sponsor and ticket revenues from increased attendance. The upgrade also included a reconstruction of the club house to facilitate luxury boxes. They were made available for sponsors, who were allowed to bring guests. The boxes and the vestibule became an important informal meeting area for the town's political and business elite.|$|E
5|$|Major {{public works}} {{projects}} financed with deficit spending included {{the construction of a}} network of Autobahns and providing funding for programmes initiated by the previous government for housing and agricultural improvements. To stimulate the construction industry, credit was offered to private businesses and subsidies were made available for home purchases and repairs. On the condition that the wife would leave the workforce, a loan of up to 1,000 Reichsmarks could be accessed by young couples of Aryan descent who intended to marry and the amount that had to <b>be</b> <b>repaid</b> was reduced by 25 percent for each child born. The caveat that the woman had to remain unemployed was dropped by 1937 due to a shortage of skilled labourers.|$|E

5|$|The Claimant was now bankrupt. In 1870 his {{new legal}} {{advisers}} launched a novel fundraising scheme: Tichborne Bonds, {{an issue of}} 1,000 debentures of £100 face value, the holders of which would <b>be</b> <b>repaid</b> with interest when the Claimant obtained his inheritance. About £40,000 was raised, though the bonds quickly traded at a considerable discount and were soon being exchanged for derisory sums. The scheme allowed the Claimant to continue to meet his living and legal expenses for a while. After a delay while the Franco-Prussian War and its aftermath prevented key witnesses from leaving Paris, the civil case that the Claimant hoped would confirm his identity finally came to court in May 1871.|$|E
5|$|The Flushing Line west of 103rd Street {{opened in}} 1917. The IRT agreed {{to operate the}} line under the {{condition}} that any loss of profits would <b>be</b> <b>repaid</b> by the city. As part of the agreement, the PSC would build the line eastward to at least Flushing. The station, as well as two other stations at Willets Point Boulevard and 111th Street, was approved in 1921 as part of an extension of the Flushing Line past 103rd Street. Construction of the station and the double-deck bridge over the Flushing Creek began on April 21, 1923, with the station built via cut-and-cover methods. The bridge was completed in 1927, and the station opened on January 21, 1928, over a decade after the line initially began operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} {{approved}} by the Parliament of Norway on 5 June 1968. An agreement regarding financing was made between A/S Sotrabrua and the Ministry of Transport and Communications on 1 July 1968. The construction of the road would be done by Hordaland Public Road Administration, who would receive two-thirds of the financing of costs up to NOK34 million from the company. The company would also advance the state's part of the costs, which would <b>be</b> <b>repaid</b> to the company as NOK1 million per year, for an estimated advance of NOK8.3 million. The company would be responsible for any interest, including that which would be accumulated during construction, and would have the right to collect tolls on all traffic on the bridge.|$|E

5|$|On 19 June 2008, the {{municipal}} council voted to not give further subsidies to the airport. Upgrades for NOK8 million {{were needed to}} meed safety standard. The airport operator had debt of NOK12 million, and no realizeable assets. Vildanden was under certain conditions willing to pay some of the capital needed to perform the upgrades. The municipal council changed their opinion and voted—with a single decisive vote—to keep the airport running in July. The financial risk would {{be taken over by}} {{the municipal}}-owned Kontorbygg, who operate a range of offices and commercial buildings in Skien. The proposal was supported by the right-winged parties, and opposed by the socialist parties, as well as the chair of Kontorbygg. As a response, the Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries reported the municipality to ESA, and demanded that NOK20 million in illegal subsidies <b>be</b> <b>repaid</b> by Vildanden and the airport operator.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{regarding}} a potential SANDAG {{purchase of the}} road began in October 2010. On July 29, 2011, SANDAG agreed to purchase the lease of the freeway from South Bay Expressway LLC; even though a study suggested that the agency might have to {{spend millions of dollars}} to maintain and repair parts of the highway. Objections raised to the purchase during the negotiation phase included needing a loan from the federal government of $1.5 million to complete the purchase, and a possible increase in traffic through Lemon Grove. The sale of the franchise rights until the year 2042 was finalized on December 16, 2011, at a price of $341.4 million, and $10.2 million in additional fees, with $254 million from TransNet sales tax revenue, some of it to <b>be</b> <b>repaid</b> with toll revenue. SANDAG claimed at the time that they would reduce the tolls to attract increased use and decrease traffic on I-805, which would mean that additional lanes would not need to be constructed on that route. Despite this, the operator decided to increase tolls instead even with the low demand for using the road; the San Diego Union-Tribune criticized the decision. in mid-2011, it cost $4 to drive the entire toll portion of the road.|$|E
5|$|Serious issues {{concerning}} {{safety and security}} in the building arose after Donald Trump was declared as President-elect of the United States on November 8, 2016. Trump Tower {{had served as a}} rallying point for the protests against Donald Trump {{in the days after the}} election's results were announced, thus requiring extra deployments of security officials. The Federal Aviation Administration imposed a no-fly zone over Trump Tower until January 20, 2017, and the NYPD stated that it was projected to spend $35 million to provide security to the tower, of which $7 million would <b>be</b> <b>repaid</b> by Congress. The NYPD later revised its estimate to $24 million. Street closures were imposed along the east side of Fifth Avenue and on the north side of 56th Street, with NYPD officers stopping and questioning pedestrians on these sidewalks as to their destinations. The block of 56th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues was closed completely to vehicular traffic, but part of the street west of Madison Avenue was later reopened to allow local deliveries. Customers to the Gucci and Tiffany's stores in Trump Tower's lobby were allowed to proceed, while other pedestrians were redirected to the opposite side of the street. During presidential visits, dump trucks from the New York City Department of Sanitation were parked outside the tower to prevent car bombs. The press nicknamed the now-heavily secured building White House North, comparing it to the White House's West Wing.|$|E
