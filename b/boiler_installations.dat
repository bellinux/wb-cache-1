50|$|A 50 MW, 50 cycle {{turbo-alternator}} from Parsons {{was commissioned}} in 1951 (no. 1), {{followed by a}} second identical unit in 1955 (no. 2). These two sets were erected on the 'A' station site and all 25 Hz equipment had been removed during this third stage of development in 1948. Steam was supplied from 4 Babcock + Wilcox pulverized coal high pressure boilers. Each boiler produced 225,000 lb/hour at 650PSI and 840degF. The No.5 turbo-alternator, an English Electric 18.75 MW 25 Hz, continued to operate for some time afterwards, using steam diverted from the new high pressure boilers. Owing to delays in <b>boiler</b> <b>installation,</b> the second 50 MW Parsons unit, which was in place from 1955, was not fully operational until 1958.

Long a forgotten area in many industrial facilities, today the steam generating complex {{is the focus of}} many corporate and plant managers. This paper discusses the approach of a large chemical company that is effectively utilizing a direct digital control (DOC) system coupled with the measurement of carbon monoxide to optimize boiler combustion and generate steam in the most cost effective manner. Significant reductions in the amount of excess air have resulted from the use of CO as a control parameter. Previously, combustion effectiveness was determined by the more typical 02 measurement. For reasons of boiler leakage and gas stratification, this control technique was not suitable when operating close to stoichiometry. The use of DOC type control in our multiple <b>boiler</b> <b>installation</b> has also enabled the intelligent allocation of boiler capacity by evaluating steam demand versus incremental boiler steam cost. The system selectively increases or decreases boiler loads within specified constraints to provide the lowest overall steam production cost while continuing to meet the steam demand...|$|R

Upgrading coal, capturing CO 2, reducing emission of NOx, SO 2, and particulate matter, and mitigating slagging, fouling, and corrosion are the key initiatives behind these efficient coal technologies. This study focuses on an efficient coal combustion technology utilizing a newly developed fuel additive (Silanite), which addresses most of the aforementioned key points. Silanite, a finely milled multioxide additive, when mixed with the coal without the {{need to change the}} <b>boiler</b> <b>installation</b> has been proven to increase the boiler {{efficiency and}} flame temperature with reduction in corrosion and NOx and particulate matter (dust) emissions.

40|$|Large {{quantities}} of low-volatile coal are utilized in power plants throughout China. With increasingly stringent environmental regulations, {{it is important}} to develop and deploy low-NOx combustion technologies for pulverized coal boilers burning low-volatile coal. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate a novel decoupling combustion system for low-volatile coal via experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The combustion system includes horizontal fuel-rich/lean low-NOx burners (LNB) and the associated air distribution system for a polygonal tangentially fired boiler (PTFB). The effects of coal particle diameter and coal feeding rate on the gas/particle flow characteristics of the burner, and the cold state aerodynamic field of the PTFB were analyzed in detail. The structural design of the LNB results in advantageous gas/particle flow characteristics and the PTFB improved the distribution of the flow field. The CFD models and simulation results were validated by comparing with those of cold experiments data. The simulation results demonstrated that this low-NOx combustion technology enhances staged combustion at different scales, which can reduce NOx generation significantly. In the industrial application on a 300 MW pulverized coal <b>boiler,</b> <b>installation</b> of the LNBs improved the stability of low-volatile coal combustion and reduced NOx emissions significantly. These research findings provide valuable guidance to the design of low-NOx combustion system for pulverized coal boilers using low volatile coal. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
