5|$|In {{response}} to the treaty, the Bhonsle and Shinde attacked the British, refusing to accept the <b>betrayal</b> <b>of</b> their sovereignty to the British by the Peshwa.

5|$|In {{the broader}} Arab world, the {{declaration}} {{was seen as}} a <b>betrayal</b> <b>of</b> the British wartime understandings with the Arabs.

5|$|Bondfield {{remained}} {{active in}} NUGMW affairs until 1938, {{and during the}} Second World War carried out investigations for the Women's Group on Public Welfare. She died in 1953; despite her years of service to party and union, and her successes in breaking through gender boundaries, {{she has not been}} greatly honoured within the Labour movement. According to a later female cabinet minister, Barbara Castle, Bondfield's actions in office had brought her close to <b>betrayal</b> <b>of</b> the movement.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{continued}} {{campaigning in}} Iowa and New Hampshire visiting {{up to four}} different cities in one day. Political commentator Bill O'Reilly slammed Dodd after he appeared on The O'Reilly Factor in August, characterizing him as a kool-aid drinker and blind follower of the far left. O'Reilly chastised Dodd and branded him a traitor for his perceived <b>betrayal</b> <b>of</b> fellow Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman during the 2006 Senatorial election.|$|E

Tourk filed for divorce shortly after the revelation and left Newsom's campaign and administration. Newsom's affair with Rippey-Tourk impacted his popularity with male voters, who viewed his indiscretions as a <b>betrayal</b> <b>of</b> a close friend and ally.|$|E
5|$|ACLU {{leadership}} was split {{on whether to}} purge its leadership of communists. Norman Thomas, John Haynes Holmes, and Morris Ernst were anti-communists who wanted to distance the ACLU from communism; opposing them were Harry Ward, Corliss Lamont and Elizabeth Flynn who rejected any political test for ACLU leadership. A bitter struggle ensued throughout 1939, and the anti-communists prevailed in February 1940, when the board voted to prohibit anyone who supported totalitarianism from ACLU leadership roles. Chairman Harry Ward immediately resigned, andfollowing a contentious six-hour debateElizabeth Flynn was voted off the ACLU's board. The 1940 resolution was {{considered by many to}} be a <b>betrayal</b> <b>of</b> its fundamental principles. The resolution was rescinded in 1968, and Flynn was posthumously reinstated to the ACLU in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie go to {{the mall}} so they can meet Santa, but Peter is asking Santa for gifts (he asks for a game of Uno, a Magna Doodle, a pet chink (a mix of a {{chinchilla}} and a mink) and a Charles in Charge lunchbox.) When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in his lap, Santa mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving before he got a chance to sit in his lap felt like a bigger betrayal than the <b>betrayal</b> <b>of</b> Gary Busey by reality; this takes us to Busey looking himself in the mirror asking his reflection, {{in the form of a}} crazed clown, how he is doing.|$|E
50|$|The lyrics, {{consisting}} of an confession <b>of</b> <b>betrayal</b> and <b>of</b> a following attempt at reconciliation, {{were seen as}} an anticipation of the moral revolution and feminist themes which exploded a few years later.|$|R
5000|$|Discovering the Meaning of Treachery Through Jane Austen, {{writes that}} [...] "there hastrayal as the {{breaking}} of a social contract; however, critics of this approach claim that the term social contract does not accurately reflect the conditions and motivations for, and effects <b>of,</b> <b>betrayal.</b> Philosophers Judith Shklar and Peter Johnson, authors of The Ambiguities <b>of</b> <b>Betrayal</b> and Frames <b>of</b> Deceit respectively, contend that while no clear definition <b>of</b> <b>betrayal</b> is available, betrayal is more effectively understood through literature.|$|R

5|$|Brian meets Arielle at {{the hotel}} and asks her to marry him, giving her a ring. Brian insists that he is truly in love with her, and Arielle accepts his proposal, telling him to meet her the next day {{at the hotel}}. Valéry shows up at Brian's {{apartment}} that night; he slaps Brian and expresses anger at Brian's <b>betrayal</b> <b>of</b> the rules and boundaries of an open marriage. He then gives Brian a check for $250,000 for Brian to give Arielle the life she deserves and leaves.

5|$|Even though Kern {{intended}} for the character's morality to be left ambiguous and to the viewer's interpretation, a majority of television commentators characterized Christy as an antagonist. Brittany Spanos of Vulture.com determined that Christy was an evil witch due to her <b>betrayal</b> <b>of</b> Billie and the Charmed Ones, and SpoilerTV's Gavin Hetherington identified her as the season's big bad. In their book The Book of Three, authors Diana G. Gallagher and Paul Ruditis wrote that she served as the Triad's protégée. Ruditis followed this up in a later interview by calling Christy a pawn {{under the control of}} the Triad rather than a proper villain; he found that the series lacked a strong, female antagonist.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Patton faced Republican Eugene Goss. Goss criticized Patton for announcing that, if elected, he would seek the governor's {{office at the}} {{expiration}} of his term. Goss insisted {{that he would not}} seek the governorship if elected, and maintained that using the lieutenant governor's post as a stepping stone to the governor's office was a <b>betrayal</b> <b>of</b> the office and its authority. Goss ran an unorthodox campaign, limiting individual contributions to his campaign to $300 and refusing to run television commercials. Patton went on to a lopsided victory in the general election, winning 514,023votes to Goss's 250,857.|$|E
50|$|Grimm criticized Rousseau's Julie, or the New Heloise and Emile, or On Education.

5000|$|I do here in {{the most}} solemn and bitter manner curse the Prime Minister of England [...] for having {{cumulated}} all his other <b>betrayals</b> <b>of</b> the national interest and honour, by his last terrible exhibition of dishonour, weakness and gullibility.

60|$|Guert had forgotten, altogether, {{that the}} use of the word lady, {{completely}} betrayed the fact of his disguise; since no man, truly of his dress and air, would think of applying such a word to his sweetheart.

5|$|Rififis heist {{scene was}} based on an actual {{burglary}} that took place in 1899 along Marseille's cours St-Louis. A gang broke into the first floor offices of a travel agency, cutting a hole in the floor and using an umbrella to catch the debris in order to make off with the contents of the jeweler's shop below. The scene where Tony regretfully chooses to kill César for his <b>betrayal</b> <b>of</b> the thieves' code of silence was filmed as an allusion to how Dassin and others felt after finding their contemporaries willing to name names in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee. This act was not in the original novel.|$|E
5|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have been}} advanced {{to explain the}} swiftness and ease of the initial Lombard advance in northern Italy. It {{has been suggested that}} the towns' doors may have been opened by the <b>betrayal</b> <b>of</b> the Gothic auxiliaries in the Byzantine army, but historians generally hold that Lombard success occurred because Italy was not considered by Byzantium as {{a vital part of the}} empire, especially at a time when the empire was imperilled by the attacks of Avars and Slavs in the Balkans and Sassanids in the east. The Byzantine decision not to contest the Lombard invasion reflects the desire of Justinian's successors to reorient the core of the Empire's polices eastward.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} glorifies {{this event}} in Poland's past and its culture, and {{the majesty of}} its kings. At the same time, the painting has darker undertones, reflecting the troubled times that befell Poland {{in the late eighteenth}} century, for the Kingdom of Prussia would become one of the partitioning powers that ended the independence of Poland. The painting was seen by some as anti-Prussian, foretelling its perceived <b>betrayal</b> <b>of</b> Poland; others have noted it is also critical of Poland, as Matejko included signs that signify this seemingly triumphant moment was a hollow, wasted victory. Matejko created his painting to remind others {{about the history of the}} no-longer-independent country he loved, and about the changing fates of history. The painting is counted among his masterpieces.|$|E
