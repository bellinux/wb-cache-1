Later, at the party, Andy complains about Justin to April (Aubrey Plaza), who makes Andy happy when she proposes putting chewed up gum in Justin's pockets. Eventually, Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives. Tom expresses anger that Leslie invited her, especially because Ron is romantically interested in her.

25|$|Working class houses {{comparable}} {{in space and}} number of rooms to the Ripley Ville houses started {{to be built in}} Bowling from about 1895 and were built in large numbers between 1900 and 1914. From about 1906 they usually had a bathroom with a WC on the first floor. Use of a transverse staircase as opposed to the longitudinal staircase in the Ripley Ville houses allowed access to a <b>bathroom</b> <b>in</b> addition to the rear bedroom. Retro fitting of bathrooms to the earlier houses of this type was accomplished by partitioning the rear bedroom. The transverse staircases were very steep compared to the Ripley Ville staircases and had no direct lighting. In most houses of this period attic bedrooms were lit only by skylights and did not have fireplaces. Although this type of house was comparable to the Ripley Ville houses of a half century earlier some aspects of the design were less satisfactory.|$|E
25|$|The SS Santa Paula (3) {{was built}} at Newport News Shipbuilding Company with her bigger sister the Santa Rosa for the Grace Line's renowned New York-Central American service, {{to replace the}} two 1932-built 9,100-ton liners of the same names. (The first Grace Line Santa Paula was a 1916-built ship.) She set sail on her maiden voyage from New York City on October 11, 1958, just one day after {{preparations}} for service were completed. Her sister entered service the following year. The ship was considered remarkable for her time, with her fireproof aluminum panel interiors and, unlike other ships of their service, every single cabin had its own <b>bathroom.</b> <b>In</b> the early 1960s Grace abandoned their South American route and put the Santa Paula and her sister on Caribbean cruising service permanently. On November 25, 1964, while the Santa Paula was returning to New York from the Caribbean, the Israeli passenger ship SS Shalom collided with the tanker MV Stolt Dagali, slicing its stern section off. The Santa Paula was the first ship {{to respond to the}} SOS sent out by the tanker's crew, and managed to rescue 25 of the 43 on board. After being operated successfully for 11 years, Grace Line sold their shipping interests to the Prudential Lines, becoming Prudential-Grace Lines. Despite high passenger numbers, in January 1971 she was put out of service and laid up at Hampton Roads, Virginia.|$|E

500|$|During one scene, Wendy tells Stan {{that she}} smelled Ms. Ellen taking a [...] "smelly dump" [...] in the <b>bathroom</b> <b>in</b> {{an attempt to}} make him less {{attracted}} to her. In the original script, Wendy originally told Stan that she had a yeast infection, but Comedy Central censors made Parker and Stone change the line. Parker and Stone said although the network typically provides great leniency in permitting obscene jokes, they often object to lines about female hygiene problems. During a cafeteria scene, a boy visible at a lunch table in the background looks exactly like Craig Tucker, but the color of his hat has been changed to make him appear to be a different character. The idea of Ms. Ellen taking one of the children to dinner came from Parker's real-life experiences.

Parker said he went on one of the lunches once and found the experience [...] "really, really creepy" [...] because he had the impression the teacher and principal were having a romantic affair.|$|E

500|$|In {{an overall}} {{positive}} {{review of the}} episode, Fred Topel of Hollywood News wrote that the opening scenes that addressed fan criticisms were a little too harsh on the show's fictional characters, having gone overboard {{to the point of}} offensiveness. He highlighted as a concern the [...] "downright racist" [...] scene ten minutes into the show between Rachel and Sunshine which he could have [...] "done without". Meghan Carlson of BuddyTV also described Rachel's behavior in the aforementioned scene as [...] "totally, patronizingly racist". Writing for The Stir, Brittany Drye asked [...] "Is Glee racist?", and cited several moments in [...] "Audition" [...] which could be perceived as racist. She found the scene with Rachel screaming at Sunshine in the <b>bathroom</b> <b>in</b> broken English to be distasteful, and also highlighted the pairing of Tina and Mike (noting their shared surname, [...] "Chang") and the joke of Jacob assuming they are a couple because they are both Asian. However, Drye speculated that in attempting [...] "self-aware racism" [...] the show was intentionally trying to point out the inanity of racist beliefs, and concluded that Glees self-awareness in this matter was its saving grace.|$|E

500|$|Selman {{told the}} Los Angeles Times that the episode praises {{collaborative}} writing, and answers {{the question of}} whether or not writing in a group is as valuable as writing alone. He commented: [...] "I've been with The Simpsons for 15 years and [...] it's been pretty much writing as a team. Weâre proud of what we've done even if it's not the traditional idea of one writer sitting down with a passion and a vision. In a strange way this episode ends up as a defense of writing in a group and celebrating the way it makes you feel connected to the work and to the people in that group in ways you didn't expect. It's all about a writers room ... and you know, in the story, Homer's cynical heist team does end up being incredibly productive." [...] The episode features several references to literature and parodies several popular young-adult book series, particularly Twilight, a vampire-themed fantasy book series by Stephenie Meyer that has received much popularity. While chasing T. R. Francis through the stadium where the dinosaur show took place, Lisa passes a <b>bathroom</b> <b>in</b> which a group of dinosaurs are smoking in reference to a Far Side comic of dinosaurs smoking.
