As $2,000,000 in financial pledges for construction of the new school building were left unfulfilled, capital campaigns at the four regional Catholic parishes were started in 2011 {{to pay off the}} remaining debt.

A student center and welcome center were added in summer 2015 renovations. In recent years, enrollment at the school has dropped, attributed in part to the diminished presence of State Farm Insurance in the area.|$|E
500|$|New Jersey law prohibits strip {{clubs and}} [...] "sexually {{oriented}} business", where stripteases and erotic dances are regularly performed, from offering both full nudity and alcohol sales. Establishments that possess a retail license and serve alcohol can only offer partially clothed {{services such as}} go-go dancing (typically in bikinis or lingerie). Clubs that are not licensed to serve alcohol will work around the restriction by implementing a <b>bring</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> bottle (BYOB) policy and operating as a [...] "juice bar". Juice bars have the appointments of full bars but only serve non-alcoholic beverages such as water, fruit juice, and flavored carbonated beverages. Such a bar could double as a service counter for the storage of BYOB material and offer ice and mixing services to create mixed drinks using the customer-purchased ingredients. Recent court decisions have held that municipalities that allow BYOB policies for restaurants must allow the same practices for strip clubs.|$|E

500|$|Gregg Shapiro of the Bay Area Reporter {{gave the}} album a mostly {{negative}} review, calling it [...] "hazardous waste". He {{also noted that}} Spears's voice was [...] "reedy, cold and mechanical" [...] when stripped from the original mixes. However, he highlighted two tracks, saying: [...] "Spears comes closest to achieving dance-diva status on the Valentin remix of [...] "Everytime", while the Davidson Ospina 2005 remix of [...] "Baby One More Time" [...] elevates the original bubblegum track to club classic." [...] Mike Daniel of The Dallas Morning News called the Justice remix of [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] the best track of the album, but said it [...] "has {{the feel of a}} hastily executed stopgap measure with almost no marketing-related thought behind it except to fulfill the once-every-two-years release cycle that's been established for Britney material." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Leah Greenblatt noted the remixes [...] "amps already-aggressive singles like [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] to brain-popping levels of synth spiraling", and transforms [...] "sad-eyed slow jams like [...] "Everytime" [...] and [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] into Hi-NRG bursts.

2500|$|Players ride {{a variety}} of objects {{considered}} to be brooms depending on level of seriousness. Many teams tend to play on PVC pipes of about a metre in length; these are usually made, but can also be purchased from quidditch suppliers such as Petersons or Blue Hawk. Less serious players or players who enjoy the whimsy of the sport often use Alivan's Shadow Chasers, which are wooden and have a tail to resemble brooms described in the Harry Potter books and movies. Oftentimes, newly formed teams tell players to BYOB (<b>bring</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> broom), which results in players coming on an assortment of camp and/or dangerous [...] "brooms", from Swiffers to 2x4 pieces of wood, though this practice is discouraged beyond the first few practices.|$|E

2500|$|The {{three factors}} that held back the {{development}} of the industry simultaneously underwent subtle but historic changes in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1973, Britain entered the European Economic Community, which required the ending of historic trade terms for New Zealand meat and dairy products. This led ultimately to a dramatic restructuring of the agricultural economy. Before this restructuring was fully implemented, diversification away from traditional protein products to products with potentially higher economic returns was explored. Vines, which produce best in low moisture and low soil fertility environments, were seen as suitable for areas that had previously been marginal pasture. The end of the 1960s saw the end of the New Zealand institution of the [...] "six o'clock swill", where pubs were open for only an hour {{after the end of the}} working day and closed all Sunday. The same legislative reform saw the introduction of BYO (<b>bring</b> <b>your</b> <b>own)</b> licences for restaurants. This had a profound and unexpected effect on New Zealanders' cultural approach to wine.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial venues {{may provide}} {{amenities}} such as bathrooms, picnic areas, lockers, equipment rentals, air refills and food service. Countries may have paintball sports guidelines, with rules on specific safety and insurance standards, and paid staff (including referees) who must ensure players are instructed in proper play to ensure participants' safety. Some fields are [...] "BYOP" [...] (<b>Bring</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Own</b> Paint), allowing players to buy paint at unrelated retail stores or online {{and use it}} at their field. However, most fields are FPO (Field Paint Only,) meaning players must buy paint at the venue or at a pro shop affiliated with the park. This is largely for revenue reasons; field and rental fees generally do not cover expenses of a paintball park. However, other reasons relating to player safety are generally cited and have some merit, as poor quality or poorly stored paint can cause gun failures or personal injury to targeted players. Other times, FPO policies are in keeping with municipal laws for wastewater and runoff; paintballs contain food dyes, and some formulations have metallic flakes and/or cornstarch {{to make them more}} visible, all of which can pose problems in water reservoirs and treatment plants. So, fields that must wash paintball paint into municipal wastewater facilities, or that have substantial rain runoff into bodies of water that are used as sources of drinking water, are generally required by the municipality to restrict players to only certain paint formulations; the easiest way to achieve this is to sell only approved paint and require that field paint be used.|$|E
