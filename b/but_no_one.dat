5|$|A major talking {{point at}} the conference was the {{discovery}} by Willis Lamb and his graduate student Robert Retherford shortly before the conference began {{that one of the}} two possible quantum states of hydrogen atoms had slightly more energy than predicted by the Paul Dirac's theory; this became known as the Lamb shift. Oppenheimer and Weisskopf suggested that this was a result of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Pre-war quantum electrodynamics (QED) gave absurd, infinite values for this; but the Lamb shift showed that it was both real and finite. Hans Kramers proposed renormalization as a solution, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> knew how to do the calculation.|$|E

5|$|She's Done it Again is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{written by}} Lloyd Lonergan and {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company in New Rochelle, New York.

A gentleman thief strikes and robs her, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> believes her. The thief is caught only by a clever detective. The film was the third release of the Thanhouser company and featured the leading players, Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane. The film was met with positive reviews, but is presumed to be lost.|$|E

5|$|After {{turning down}} offers from IBM and the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Segrè {{returned}} to Berkeley in 1952. He {{moved his family}} from Berkeley to nearby Lafayette, California, in 1955. Working with Chamberlain and others, he began searching for the antiproton, a subatomic antiparticle of the proton. The antiparticle of the electron, the positron had been predicted by Paul Dirac in 1931 and then discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1932. By analogy, it was now expected {{that there would be}} an antiparticle corresponding to the proton, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> had found one, and even in 1955 some scientists doubted that they existed. Using Lawrence's Bevatron set to 6GeV, they managed to detect conclusive evidence of antiprotons. Chamberlain and Segrè were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery. This was controversial, because Clyde Wiegand and Thomas Ypsilantis were co-authors of the same article, but did not share the prize.|$|E

As they leave, T-Rick discovers his gnome stolen and chases after them but they escape in Thomas' mini-van. As night falls, the party's start time passes <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> turns up and Thomas worries that the party will fail. Suddenly, party-goers arrive en-masse. Thomas intends to limit the party to the backyard and poolhouse with the house guarded by two young security guards, Everett and Tyler.

Thomas questions Costa on how he advertised the party, forcing him to confess that he put ads on Craigslist and on a local radio station, worried that no one would attend.|$|E

5|$|During the game's development, {{the team}} lacked artists. The art {{director}} at Epic Games, Shane Caudle, and the artists at Digital Extremes {{could not make}} enough new textures because {{of the amount of}} diversity in characters and maps. In order to supplement the skin and texture production, Epic turned to contract artist Steve Garofalo. The game's level and content management program, UnrealEd, was written in Visual Basic and considered buggy, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> had time to fix it. The game engine had an object-oriented design, and the scripting language, UnrealScript, was considered to be more like Java. The modularity of the object-oriented design meant that programmers could make large changes without affecting other parts of the game. Other tools used during development included Microsoft Visual Studio and 3D Studio Max. All of the weapon sound effects were created by Sonic Mayhem. The soundtrack for the game, which employed the system of module files, was written by Alexander Brandon, Michiel van den Bos, Andrew Sega, Dan Gardopee and Peter Hajba.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1018 Ivan Vladislav besieged Dyrrhachium, but in February {{he was killed}} under {{the walls of the}} city. The {{accounts}} of his death are contradictory. According to some he became victim of a plot and was killed by his servants; according to others, he perished in battle. The Bulgarian additions to the Skylitzes Chronicle are more detailed, saying that Ivan Vladislav dueled with the strategos of Dyrrhachium, the patrikios Niketas Pegonites, on horseback, and while fighting, two Byzantine infantrymen from the audience rushed to the emperor and wounded him mortally in the belly. A later Byzantine historian claimed that the duel was fair and Pegonites stabbed Ivan Vladislav in the chest with his spear, killing him instantly. The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja reports an altogether different story: while having a meal in his camp, the emperor was attacked by an unknown soldier, in whom Ivan Vladislav seemed to have recognized the murdered Jovan Vladimir. Terrified, he cried for help <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> rushed to his rescue and the unknown soldier mortally wounded the Bulgarian ruler.|$|E
5|$|Josephine, who was of Jewish heritage, had Earp's body cremated and {{secretly}} buried his {{remains in the}} Marcus family plot at the Hills of Eternity, a Jewish cemetery in Colma, California. When she died in 1944, her remains were interred alongside his. In 1957, the Tombstone Restoration Commission looked for Wyatt's ashes {{with the goal of}} having them moved to Tombstone. They contacted family members seeking permission and the location of his ashes, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> could tell them where Wyatt was buried, not even his closest living relative, George Earp. Arthur King, a deputy to Earp from 1910 to 1912, finally revealed that Josephine had buried Wyatt's cremated remains in Colma, California, and the Tombstone Commission cancelled its plans to relocate his ashes.|$|E
