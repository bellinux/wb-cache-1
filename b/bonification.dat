25|$|In the {{previous}} years, the Tour de France had been {{decided in the}} mountains. The organisation wanted the {{other aspects of the}} race to be more important, so some mountains were not visited in 1950, and the time <b>bonification</b> for cyclists that reached mountain tops first was reduced. from 1 minute in 1949 to 40 seconds in 1950.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sixteenth}} stage, Ockers and Bobet {{finished}} shortly after Kübler. The Tour de France jury said Bobet came in second, {{and gave him}} the 30 seconds <b>bonification</b> time, but the Belgian team manager Sylvère Maes protested against this decision, because he argued that Ockers came in second. Maes threatened to take the Belgian team out of the race, but the Tour direction did not change their decision. In the end, the Belgian team stayed in the race.|$|E
50|$|After that stage, Bartali was {{in second}} place in the general classification. He won some time on Vervaecke because of <b>bonifications</b> for {{reaching}} the tops of the Portet d'Aspet and the Braus first and winning the 11th stage, but lost some time in the individual time trial in stage 10b.|$|R
50|$|There {{were several}} classifications in the 1979 Tour de France, {{four of them}} {{awarding}} jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered {{the winner of the}} Tour. In previous years, the team time trials only counted for the team classification, and not for the general classification, except for the <b>bonifications.</b> From 1979 on, the team trial also counted for the general classification.|$|R

The first part identifies the main changes in the taxation of entrepreneurs, the second part is devoted to the effects caused by introducing a linear tax rate of 15 %, increase in tax <b>bonifications</b> and exclusion of pension insurance premiums and the contribution to the state employment policy and health care insurance from the tax deductible expenses. The thesis compares the taxation of income between 2007 and 2008 in both absolute and relative terms...|$|R
25|$|The race jury {{invoked the}} 'rain rule' for the Champs-Élysées, meaning that Lance Armstrong became {{the winner of}} the General {{classification}} the first time the race passed the finish line, rather than the eighth time as normal. The time <b>bonification</b> for {{the winner of the}} stage was still given, and Alexander Vinokourov profited from this as he won the stage after an escape in the last kilometer (the first time since 1994 that the final stage did not end in a sprint), and passed Levi Leipheimer in the general classification to end fifth.|$|E
500|$|Van Dijk participated at La Course by Le Tour de France, {{the inaugural}} edition of a women's race {{on the final}} day and on the same circuit of the Tour de France with {{worldwide}} broadcasting. Van Dijk attacked multiple times and was the only women who was able to get clear for a few laps with a maximal advantage of over half a minute. At the Open de Suède Vårgårda TTT, where she finished third with her team, she got some confidence back about her time trial performances. In begin September Van Dijk won the time trial of the Boels Rental Ladies Tour, with a 12 seconds gap over her main rival Lisa Brennauer. Her first international time trial victory of the season. With the other stages ending in a bunch sprint and sprinters winning the <b>bonification</b> seconds, Van Dijk finished third in the general classification. A final test for het time trial capabilities before the World Championships was at the Chrono Champenois ITT. Halfway the [...] time trial she had a 39 seconds advantage over Hanna Solovey, but she finished second 8 seconds behind her because she lost about a minute after riding the wrong direction.|$|E
500|$|The sixth {{stage was}} {{shortened}} {{from its original}} length of [...] to [...] This was still the race's second-longest stage, and it featured a breakaway which shook up the race standings. Eleven riders finished nearly twelve minutes {{in front of the}} peloton, and reigning Italian national road race champion Giovanni Visconti assumed the race lead, by a margin of less than one second over fellow breakaway member Matthias Russ. Russ had begun the stage 13 seconds ahead of Visconti in the overall classification, but with Visconti gaining seven seconds on Russ at the finish line and six in <b>bonification</b> on the stage's intermediate sprint, the young Italian became the next to wear the pink jersey. Visconti and his team [...] ably defended the jersey for nine days, keeping it through the hilly seventh and eighth stages, {{as well as in the}} individual time trial in stage 11 and in three flat stages. Visconti eventually lost the lead on stage 14, the Giro's first stage categorized as high mountain, as he finished more than eighteen minutes behind stage winner Emanuele Sella. The race lead passed to Gabriele Bosisio after that stage, but he was unable to hold it the next day, finishing fifteen minutes behind Sella, again the stage winner. It was on this stage that Alberto Contador took the lead that he would never relinquish.|$|E
5000|$|The {{salaries}} of civil servant professors in Spain are fixed in a nationwide basis, {{but there are}} some bonus related to performance and seniority and a number of bonus granted by regional governments.

[...] Sagan then had problems with his rear derailleur and was soon relegated {{to the back of the}} peloton, where he sorted out the problem without leaving the saddle. The Mancebo-Westra duo cooperated well, taking advantage of the sprinters' teams confusion, and managed to resist. Westra outsprinted Mancebo to take 's second win of the year and the 10 seconds <b>bonification.</b> Sagan won the sprint of the bunch, coming in six seconds after the escapees.

50|$|The <b>bonification</b> {{system from}} the 1933 Tour de France was {{slightly}} reduced: now the winner of a stage received 90 seconds <b>bonification,</b> and the second cyclist 45 seconds. In addition to this, {{the winner of the}} stage received a <b>bonification</b> equal to the difference between him and the second-placed cyclists, with a maximum of two minutes. This same <b>bonification</b> system was applied on mountain summits that counted for the mountains classification.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bonification</b> {{system was}} reduced {{compared}} to 1937: {{the winner of}} a stage now only received one minute <b>bonification</b> time, added by the margin to the second arriving cyclist, with a maximum of 75 seconds.

The last <b>bonification</b> system was also used for the first cyclist to reach a mountain top that counted for the mountains classification.|$|E
50|$|In the 1931 Tour de France, {{there had}} been a time <b>bonification</b> system, which gave 3 minutes of <b>bonification</b> to the winner of the stage, if he {{finished}} more than three minutes ahead of the second cyclist in that stage. In 1932, this <b>bonification</b> system changed: now the winner of the stage received 4 minutes, the second-placed cyclist 2 minutes and the third-placed cyclist 1 minute, plus an extra three minutes if the margin was more than three minutes. The <b>bonification</b> system was invented to give sprinters, who lost {{a lot of time in}} the mountains, a chance to battle for the general classification.|$|E
50|$|Merckx' won the prologue, beating his concurrents by some seconds. In {{the first}} stage, Cyrille Guimard won the sprint, {{and because of}} the <b>bonification</b> seconds took over the first {{position}} in the general classification. In the next stages, Merckx tried to win back time by winning <b>bonification</b> seconds in intermediate sprints and at the finish, but Guimard used the same tactic. Merckx won back the first position thanks to the <b>bonification</b> seconds after the team time trial in stage 3b, but lost it again in the fourth stage.Merckx won the time trial {{in the second part of}} the fifth stage, but Guimard became third, and kept the lead.
