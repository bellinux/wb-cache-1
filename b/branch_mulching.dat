Here we integrated fish-scale pits, semicircular mini-catchments for hill slope runoff collection, with mulches to test their effects on soil water storage in a 12 -year-old dryland jujube orchard on the Loess Plateau of China, by using soil water measurements from April  2013 to November  2014. This experiment included four treatments: fish-scale pits with <b>branch</b> <b>mulching</b> (FB), fish-scale pits with straw mulching (FS), fish-scale pits without mulching (F), and bare land treatment (CK). Soil water was measured using the TRIME ® -IPH time-domain reflectometer (TDR) tool in 20  cm intervals down {{to a depth of}} 180  cm, and was measured once every 2 weeks in the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons. The results showed that fish-scale pits with mulching were better in soil water conservation. Average soil water storage (SWS, for short) of FB at soil layer depths of 0 – 180  cm increased by 14. 23  % (2013) and 21. 81  % (2014), respectively, compared to CK, but only increased by 4. 82  % (2013) and 5. 34  % (2014), respectively, for the F treatment. The degree of soil water compensation, W S, was employed here to represent to what extent soil water was recharged from precipitation {{at the end of the}} rainy season relative to that at the beginning of the rainy season. A positive (negative) W S larger (lower) soil water content at the end of rainy season than at the beginning. For the treatment of FB, the values of W S over the entire soil profile were greater than 0; for the treatment of F, negative values of W S were observed in depths of 60 – 100  cm in both years. However, the bare land treatment showed negative values in depths of 40 – 180  cm. This indicated that integrating fish-scale pits with mulching could significantly increase soil water storage by increasing infiltration and decreasing evaporation, and it showed greater soil water storage and degree of soil water compensation compared to fish-scale pits alone. Since the branches used for mulching here were trimmed jujube branches, the cost of mulching materials was largely reduced. Therefore, integration of fish-scale pits with <b>branch</b> <b>mulching</b> is recommended in orchards for soil water conservation on the Loess Plateau and potentially for other regions...|$|E
40|$|Soil loss due {{to water}} erosion {{is a serious}} problem in Mediterranean areas, that causes great concern. The {{resulting}} pattern of vegetation and bare soil is a key factor in runoff generation. According to this, different organic carbon extra-sources (sewage sludge, polymers, mulching, manure, etc) have been proved as an erosion control methods. Some studies indicate a positive influence on plant cover and sediment yield and reducing the high soil losses usually found in degraded areas, bare slopes and cultivate soils from Mediterranean. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the role played by different soil amendments in the runoff generation and soil loss from closed and afforested plots. The experimental area is located in the Natural Park of Sierra Tejeda, Almijara and Alhama, in South of Spain. The study was carried out in seven 24 m 2 (2 x 12 m) closed plots. Every pot had four repetitions. Rainfall was measured with a tipping-bucket raingauge (0. 2 mm accuracy). In order to verify possible differences, we applied the test of Mann-Whitney U in corroboration with the previous homogeneity test of variance. Average total runoff collected from the 24 m 2 plots was negligible for pinus <b>branches</b> <b>mulching</b> (5. 52 l) and straw mulch (6. 36 l), and high for hydroabsorbent polymers (22. 49 l) and sheep manure (23. 67 l). Mean soil losses for each of the land management indicated that hydroabsorbent polymers and sheep manure contributed with the greatest amounts, while straw <b>mulch</b> and pinus <b>branches</b> had negligible or no soil loss. The applications of straw <b>mulch</b> and pinus <b>branches</b> were very effective in reducing soil losses and produced an increase on the available water content respect to the control plots, although was lower than hydroabsorbent polymers.
