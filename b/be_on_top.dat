25|$|Indeed, Sri Lanka's first Test matches were promising, {{but in the}} end {{it often}} ran away from them at crucial moments. An example of this would be Dias' third Test, which was the second Test of three in Pakistan. Batting first, Sidath Wettimuny and Dias added 217 for the second wicket, then a Sri Lankan record {{partnership}} for any wicket. That enabled Sri Lanka to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top,</b> leading by 184 on first innings, but they could not bowl out Pakistan and had to settle for a draw. Sri Lanka went on to lose the series 0–2, despite Dias recording a career best 109 in the Third Test.|$|E
25|$|Reducing defects on extreme {{ultraviolet}} (EUV) masks is currently {{one of the}} most critical issues to be addressed for commercialization of EUV lithography. Defects can be buried underneath or within the multilayer stack or <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the multilayer stack. Mesas or protrusions form on the sputtering targets used for multilayer deposition, which may fall off as particles during the multilayer deposition. In fact, defects of atomic scale height (0.3–0.5nm) with 100nm FWHM can still be printable by exhibiting 10% CD impact. IBM and Toppan reported at Photomask Japan 2015 that smaller defects, e.g., 50nm size, can have 10% CD impact even with 0.6nm height, yet remain undetectable.|$|E

It {{is also used}} in Central America, the Caribbean, northern South America (Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and, as a legacy, parts of Brazil), Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia. This socket is recommended in IEC standard 60906-2 for 120 volt 60Hz installations. Looking directly at a NEMA 5-15 socket in the commonly found orientation of ground (earth) at the bottom, the neutral slot is on the left, and the line slot is on the right.

500|$|By January 2013, Zedd {{clarified}} {{that due}} to their busy schedules {{it was difficult to}} complete the project and work progressed mainly during the tour. Talking to Sirius XM Radio in December 2013, where she gave an in-depth analysis of each song from the album, Gaga further expanded on the concept of new-wave feminism: [...] "The record's all about being comfortable underneath, because you are strong enough to know that you don't have to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> to know you're worth it," [...] she concluded.|$|E

Outside of the US, American Tragedy charted number five in Canadian albums charts and number 43 in the UK albums charts.|$|E

500|$|The band Them {{was signed}} by Phil Solomon, who {{contracted}} producer Bert Berns {{to work with the}} group, and Phil Coulter came on as a musical arranger and lyricist. The group became popular with songs including [...] "Baby Please Don't Go", [...] "Gloria", and [...] "Here Comes the Night". Morrison commented of Them: [...] "Them were never meant to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>Top</b> of the Pops. I mean, miming? lip syncing? We used to laugh at that programme, think it was a joke. Then we were on it ourselves. It was ridiculous. We were totally anti that sort of thing.

500|$|Butters and Fazekas {{stated that}} Underwood [...] "doesn’t quite {{understand}} what it’s {{like to be}} a normal woman" [...] after her upbringing in the program, and is intrigued by Carter. Regan elaborated that [...] "she’s never seen anyone like [...] before and she’s never been beaten before. There’s this competitive but playful obsession with her" [...] which is seen with Underwood's [...] "flirtation" [...] and [...] "feminine prowess". Regan continued, [...] "She knows that to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> she has to beat Peggy ... So Dottie does want to get under her skin. She tries to make her feel uncomfortable and that might be with a look or a glance or what she says." [...] Atwell said, [...] "Peggy has male baddies that she fights, but to have someone who is physically her equal—she's a Black Widow, incredibly capable and very smart—I think that shows some balance for Peggy, like a flip side of the same coin." [...] After Carter defeats Underwood and Leviathan in the first season, Underwood becomes [...] "a lone wolf ... she’s a woman without a country right now, but she is more involved in the [...] case" [...] for the second season than it initially appears.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening scene}} in the subway was {{initially}} going to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of a building so that the episode would begin and end the same, but co-creator J.J. Abrams {{thought it would be}} better to start it underground and [...] "move up throughout the episode". The episode began the setup of Olivia's backstory by revealing the Cortexiphan drug trials, which would be an ongoing plot point in continuing episodes. All the shots were chosen carefully to put the viewer in Olivia's troubled frame of mind, and consequently the episode had many tight shots that were meant to give a [...] "sense of unease". The producers felt that shooting on the lab set was the [...] "hardest set to shoot at on the planet" [...] because it contained several levels that inhibited the crew's ability to move cameras around. As Goldsman had an aversion to shooting in hospitals, they used a church for the mental hospital scenes. When Olivia, Peter, and Walter are en route to the climax at the building, the shots of them in the SUV were just shots of them driving back and forth on the 59th Street Bridge.|$|E

500|$|Recording of Satisfied {{began in}} September 2007 at Southern Tracks Recording in Atlanta, Georgia. [...] As with DecembeRadio's {{previous}} album, Scotty Wilbanks {{was hired as}} the producer. [...] Said Reedy of Wilbanks, [...] "We just have a kindredship as musicians and as players.... There's {{a lot of excitement}} and passion that comes from his end.... big thing for us is having a really good time. [...] If we're not having a good time making a record, it's gonna show and you're gonna hear it." [...] To capture the excitement of their live shows, DecembeRadio recorded basic tracks live in the studio. [...] Reedy said recording live is particularly useful for capturing energetic performances from drummer Boone Daughdrill. [...] "It's definitely very critical for him to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of his game and feeling like it's a unit, because you play off of each other. [...] It's a real push and pull thing that happens in rock and roll music that you really can't sometimes capture by just doing it track by track by track", said Reedy. [...] Miker said the band recorded a handful of songs that were [...] "out of the box of where CCM music is", and Reedy noted that some tracks [...] "stretched what we're doing ... with production." [...] "Gasoline", for example, includes a [...] "Beatlesque" [...] section with a children's choir, string section and piccolo trumpet, and [...] "Falling for You" [...] begins and ends with some guitar [...] "shred licks" [...] that started as a joke in the writing process.|$|E
500|$|However, Auerbach {{could not}} prevent the Celtics from {{going into a}} slump {{at the end of}} the 1970s. He traded away both Silas and Westphal because they wanted salary {{increases}} that would have made them higher earners than the best player on the Celtics (Cowens), which was not acceptable to Auerbach. [...] While the Westphal trade to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Charlie Scott was considered a success due to the Celtics' 13th title in 1976, Auerbach later admitted he erred in letting Silas go, even after Cowens personally begged him to give Silas a new deal. When Havlicek retired in 1978, the Celtics went 61–103 in two seasons. In the summer of 1978, after the worst in a string of contentious clashes with several different owners after Walter Brown's passing in 1964, Auerbach hopped into a taxi to take him to Logan Airport, where he was to board a flight to New York to consider a lucrative contract offer from Knicks owner Sonny Werblin. However, the cab driver pleaded with him to stay, emphasizing how much Bostonians loved him and considered him family. Soon after, heading a team press conference, and with his typical bravado, Auerbach puffed on his trademark cigar and stated simply, [...] "I'm not going anywhere. [...] We're going to sign Larry Bird, and we're going to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> again." [...] Despite knowing that Bird, a talented young player from unheralded Indiana State, had a year of college eligibility remaining, he had drafted Bird as a junior eligible in the 1978 NBA draft and waited for a year until the future Hall-of-Fame forward Bird arrived, finally setting aside his team salary rules when it became clear that his choices were paying Bird a record-setting rookie salary or watch him simply re-enter the 1979 draft. Bird then became the highest-paid Celtic as a rookie, with a $650,000-per year deal. Auerbach knew that the brilliant, hardworking Bird would be the cornerstone of a new Celtics generation.|$|E

2500|$|Evans {{became known}} as an {{innovator}} during {{more than two decades}} with the American League. One obituary observed that he [...] "introduced something new to officiating by running down to a base where a play was made so that he would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of it". This approach became a standard practice among major league officials. He was also aware of the increasing demands placed on umpires and strongly advocated formal training for baseball officials. Furthermore, in a game that retained much of the rough-and-tumble atmosphere of earlier decades, Evans [...] "substituted diplomacy for belligerency and proved an arbiter could control a game without threats of physical violence".|$|E

In August 2012, the pilots voted to organize and joined the Teamsters. Allegiant's chairman and CEO, Maurice J. Gallagher Jr., has {{been critical of the}} unionization of airline employees and has stated that [...] "Unionization {{is one of those things}} that clogs the arteries and makes you less quick and not as nimble as you need to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of your game...

2500|$|Henry is {{presented}} as a good man, but a poor king, to whom Roger Warren refers as [...] "a man of deep religious conviction but no political acumen." [...] He is a weak leader, and it is partly his failure to assert his authority that is responsible for the chaos that takes over the country. As director Peter Hall says, [...] "In theory, Henry should be a good king. He applies Christian ethics to government. But he is up against men who don't. They justify their behaviour by invoking the great sanctions – God, the King, Parliament, the People – that unscrupulous statesmen, motivated by the naked desire to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top,</b> have used throughout the ages.

In both of these styles, as with most percussion grips, the fulcrum consists of the contact between the thumb and middle finger. The index finger is used as a guide and to help lift the stick off of the drum. The American grip is a hybrid of these two grips. Another known grip is known as the Amsterdam Grip, made famous by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, which is similar to the Hinger grip, except the stick is cradled on the lower knuckle of the index finger.|$|E
