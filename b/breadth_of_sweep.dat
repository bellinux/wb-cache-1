40|$|This four volume hard bound elegant looking rather {{expensive}} set is {{a comprehensive}} record of women's history from prehistoric times to the modern day. It summarises and synthesises the social, political and historical movements that shaped and affected women through the centuries. It does this {{in the form of}} entries in history and geography, culture and society, biographies and gender studies, and movements and organisations. There are nearly 1250 entries and subentries, more than 600 articles along with 650 biographies by 900 scholars [only a sprinkling of them being men, making it a predominantly female bastion of scholarship], representing 50 countries from all over the globe, with more than 1. 6 million words and 450 illustrations. An editorial board of scholars in women's and world history, with more than a dozen editors at Oxford University Press, worked to bring into fruition an idea that emerged with the start of the new millennium, in 2000 - to survey the history of women in the world. Not one country, not one culture, the whole world. That itself speaks for the <b>breadth</b> and <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the scholarship that has gone into this mammoth work.

In this study, person-centered analyses were used to examine patterns <b>of</b> <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> participation in both organized and unstructured leisure activities among rural adolescents (N = 276, 49 % female) across grades 7, 8, and 10. Adjusting for self-selection factors, the study associated these patterns with 10 th grade outcomes. Three profiles of participation emerged: consistently low breadth, consistently average breadth, and consistently high <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> involvement in both organized and unstructured leisure activities over time. The most popular activity types across profile groups were hanging out with friends, team sports, and outdoor activities. Adolescents involved in a greater <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> organized activities reported the greatest <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> involvement in unstructured leisure and the best functioning. Adolescents with low <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> involvement in both organized and unstructured leisure activities consistently showed poorer outcomes. Adolescents in the high <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> involvement profile were engaged in all activity types at higher rates than adolescents in the average and low <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> involvement profiles. We advocate for continued efforts to increase adolescent participation {{in a variety of}} different types of out-of-school activities...|$|R

These are the Measures of the Bows, as they would be were the Sun but a Point; for by the <b>Breadth</b> <b>of</b> his Body, the <b>Breadth</b> <b>of</b> the Bows will be increased, and their Distance decreased by half a Degree, and so the <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> the interior Iris will be 2 Degr. 15 Min. that of the exterior 3 Degr. 40 Min. their distance 8 Degr. 25 Min. the greatest Semi-diameter of the interior Bow 42 Degr. 17 Min. and the least of the exterior 50 Degr. 42 Min. And such are the Dimensions of the Bows in the Heavens found to be very nearly, when their Colours appear strong and perfect. For once, by such means as I then had, I measured the greatest Semi-diameter of the interior Iris about 42 Degrees, and the <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> the red, yellow and green in that Iris 63 or 64 Minutes, besides the outmost faint red obscured by the brightness of the Clouds, for which we may allow 3 or 4 Minutes more. The <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> the blue was about 40 Minutes more besides the violet, which was so much obscured by the brightness of the Clouds, that I could not measure its breadth. But supposing the <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> the blue and violet together to equal that of the red, yellow and green together, the whole <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> this Iris will be about 2-1/4 Degrees, as above. The least distance between this Iris and the exterior Iris was about 8 Degrees and 30 Minutes. The exterior Iris was broader than the interior, but so faint, especially on the blue side, that I could not measure its breadth distinctly. At another time when both Bows appeared more distinct, I measured the <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> the interior Iris 2 Gr. 10´, and the <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> the red, yellow and green in the exterior Iris, was to the <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> the same Colours in the interior as 3 to 2.|$|R
40|$|Mindset theory {{suggests}} that a deliberative mindset entails openness to information in one’s environment, whereas an implemental mindset entails filtering of information. We hypothesized that this open- versus closed-mindedness influences individuals’ <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> visual attention. In Studies 1 and 2, we induced an implemental or deliberative mindset, and measured <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> attention using participants’ length estimates of x-winged Müller-Lyer figures. Both studies demonstrate a narrower <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> attention in the implemental mindset than in the deliberative mindset. In Study 3, we manipulated participants’ mindsets and measured the <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> attention by tracking eye movements during scene perception. Implemental mindset participants focused on foreground objects, whereas deliberative mindset participants attended more evenly to the entire scene. Our findings imply that deliberative versus implemental mindsets already operate {{at the level of}} visual attention...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} effect of worker heterogeneity, firm size, and {{establishment}} size on the <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> employer health insurance offerings. DATA SOURCES: The data were drawn from the 1993 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Employer Health Insurance Survey of 22, 000 business establishments selected randomly from ten states. STUDY DESIGN: The analysis was cross-sectional, using ordered probit models to relate the <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> plan offerings to firm characteristics. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Firms with more diverse workforces offered a more diverse set of health insurance options. Firm and establishment size independently influenced the <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> plan offerings. CONCLUSIONS: Employers are responsive to worker heterogeneity when determining the <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> their health insurance offerings. However, diseconomies of scale in the purchase and administration of health insurance appear to limit the extent to which small employers can accommodate diverse worker preferences...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem in}} this {{investigation}} {{was to determine the}} stress and deflection patterns of a thick cantilever plate at various angles of sweepback. The plate was tested at angles of sweepback of zero, twenty, forty, and sixty degrees under uniform shear load at the tip, uniformly distributed load and torsional loading. For all angles <b>of</b> <b>sweep</b> and for all types of loading the area of critical stress is near the intersection of the root and trailing edge. Stresses near the leading edge at the root decreased rapidly with increase in angle <b>of</b> <b>sweep</b> for all types of loading. In the outer portion of the plate near the trailing edge the stresses due to the uniform shear and the uniformly distributed load did not vary for angles <b>of</b> <b>sweep</b> up to forty degrees. For the uniform shear and the uniformly distributed loads for all angles <b>of</b> <b>sweep</b> the area in which end effect is pronounced extends from the root to approximately three quarters of a chord length outboard of a line perpendicular to the axis of the plate through the trailing edge root. In case of uniform shear and uniformly distributed loads the deflections near the edge at seventy-five per cent semi-span decreased with increase in angle <b>of</b> <b>sweep.</b> Deflections near the trailing edge under the same loading conditions increased with increase in angle <b>of</b> <b>sweep</b> for small angles and then decreased at the higher angles <b>of</b> <b>sweep.</b> The maximum deflection due to torsional loading increased with increase in angle <b>of</b> <b>sweep.</b> ...|$|R
