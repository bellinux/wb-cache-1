25|$|The club crest first {{featured}} on the kit in 1956, {{which at the time}} was modelled on the coat of arms of the Borough of Burslem. It featured the scythe of the Tunstall arms, the fretted cross of Audley, and two Josiah Wedgwood pots. The crest was removed in 1964, and replaced by a 'P.V.F.C.' monogramme, which in turn was abandoned in 1981. The eighth cumulative crest was introduced in 1983. The two symbols on the club's badge were a <b>bottle</b> <b>oven</b> and the Stafford knot, associated with the city of Stoke-on-Trent's pottery industry and the history of the local area. The current crest was introduced in February 2013, which was a modern rehash of the crest the club introduced in 1956; it included local historical referencesâ€“ the Portland Vases representing Josiah Wedgwood, the Scythe coming from the house crest of the Sneyd family, and the silver cross appearing from the house crest of the Audley family, as well as the Stafford knot above the crest.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{a decline}} in the pottery {{industry}} in Staffordshire during the mid-20th century, Thomas Forester & Sons ceased as a manufacturer in 1959. This was due to a combination of World War II when production was very limited and by the Clean Air Act that was introduced in 1956. This move stopped the use of <b>bottle</b> <b>ovens.</b>|$|R
50|$|A.J. Wilkinson (Arthur J. Wilkinson, Royal Staffordshire Pottery) was a pottery or potbank at Newport in Burslem, {{owned by}} the Shorter family since 1894. A {{sprawling}} complex of <b>bottle</b> <b>ovens,</b> kilns and production shops, it lay beside the Trent and Mersey Canal, the artery which provided it with coal and the raw materials for earthenware. In its heyday it employed 400 manual workers.|$|R
5000|$|The raw {{materials}} of pottery include clay, quartz and feldspar. These are mixed sieved and filtered to make slip, which is pressed {{to make a}} workable body. Bowls are jolleyed on a wheel, plates are jiggered on a wheel and fancies moulded in plaster moulds. This greenware is dried, and placed into saggars which are stacked into a <b>bottle</b> <b>oven</b> for the first or biscuit) firing at 1,000C. The resulting [...] "biscuit ware" [...] can be decorated with an underglaze transfer and coated with a glaze. These are then placed in a saggar with kiln furniture thimbles to separate them and fired for a second time, the glost firing can be up to 1,400C, in another <b>bottle</b> <b>oven.</b> Depending on ware, the item could be decorated and gilded by hand and be fired {{for a third time}} in a muffle kiln at 1,250.|$|E
50|$|Placing {{and drawing}} the kiln was {{the job of}} placers. Placers would take the unfired {{greenware}} that was drying in the greenhouse (or the glost placing shop) and stack it in the saggar. They would seal the saggar, then carry it into the <b>bottle</b> <b>oven</b> on their heads. Each loaded saggar weighed around 56 lb. They were stacked in bungs {{in such a way}} so the most delicate wares were protected. A bung of saggars would be 12 or 13 high, {{on the top of the}} bung would be unfired newly moulded green saggars. In the centre of the <b>bottle</b> <b>oven</b> is the well-hole, over it, saggars with no bottoms would be placed in the pipe-bung: this formed a chimney to draw the fires. When the kiln was full, the clammins were bricked up leaving one brick short to form a spyhole so the firemen could watch the buller's rings to judge the temperature of the firing.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bottle</b> <b>oven</b> kiln is {{protected}} by an outer hovel which helps to create an updraught. The biscuit kiln was filled with saggars of green flatwares (bedded in flint) by placers. The doors (clammins) were bricked up and then the firing began. Each firing took 14 tons of coal. Fires were lit in the firemouths and baited every four hours. Flames rose up inside the kiln and heat passed between the bungs of saggars. They controlled {{the temperature of the}} firing using dampers in the crown. The firing was monitored by Bullers rings placed in the kiln. A kiln would be fired to 1250C.|$|E
50|$|By far {{the largest}} number of UK pottery {{manufacturers}} were based in and around Stoke-on-Trent in a region known as The Potteries. Their businesses, locally known as potbanks, fired their wares in distinctive <b>bottle</b> <b>ovens.</b> At {{the turn of the twentieth}} century over 4,000 of these were in use, although by 2014 only 47 survive, all of which are no longer in production but are listed buildings.|$|R
50|$|The {{museum is}} located in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire.It is also {{included}} {{in one of the}} regional routes of the European Route of Industrial Heritage.Despite the name of the museum, it is a complex of buildings from two works, the Gladstone and the Roslyn.The protected features include the kilns. As there are less than 50 surviving <b>bottle</b> <b>ovens</b> in Stoke-on-Trent (and only a scattering elsewhere in the UK), the museum's kilns along with others in the Longton conservation area represent a significant proportion of the national stock of the structures.|$|R
5000|$|Speaking of his constituency, Hunt {{said that}} [...] "The key to helping {{manufacturing}} is investing {{in education and}} schools and also selling Stoke nationally and internationally {{as a place to}} invest." [...] He also criticised the local council's decision [...] "to try to obliterate the past out and sort of 'cleanse', removing the old <b>bottle</b> <b>ovens</b> and other relics". He instead believed that the city's reputation as a quality pottery maker should be exploited. He has also stated he could better serve his constituency were he to become a Government Minister.|$|R

5000|$|The potbank {{employed}} a cod placer {{to supervise the}} work, but placers who were paid by the job used to wait outside the potbanks for work. Drawing would be done 48 hours after firing finished but in hard times placers were sent into a kiln that was still glowing red after 24. The men wore five layers of clothing and wet cloths over their heads. Life expectancy for a placer was low.A <b>bottle</b> <b>oven</b> would be fired once a week. The fires were set {{in each of the}} firemouths by the firemen. Once alight the kiln would be heated slowly as the moisture was burned out of the clay, this was known as [...] "smoking". Then the kiln would be taken to full temperature, and kept there for three hours then allowed to cool. A biscuit firing took three days and a glost firing took two days. After 48 hours the kiln had cooled sufficiently to be drawn by the placers, and the wares checked. The placers' earnings were dependent on the success of the firing.|$|E
50|$|The Spode Museum {{is based}} in Stoke-on-Trent, England, where Josiah Spode, {{one of the great}} names of the Industrial Revolution, {{established}} his pottery business in 1774. His great achievements include the formulation of Bone China, which became the standard for all English chinawares, and the development and perfection of underglaze transfer printing on earthenwares, which enabled mass-production of attractively decorated ceramic items on a scale never previously achieved. By the early 1820s, his factory, now managed by his son Josiah Spode II and his business partner William Copeland, had become the largest in Stoke, employing some 2,000 workers and boasting 22 <b>bottle</b> <b>ovens.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The factory opened as {{a museum}} in 1974, the {{buildings}} having been saved from demolition in 1970 when the pottery closed (some ten years after its <b>bottle</b> <b>ovens</b> were last fired). In the 1990s ownership passed to Stoke-on-Trent City Council.The museum has shown its commitment to industrial heritage by functioning as a working pottery. However, production has had to be curtailed for financial reasons and the museum is therefore less of a [...] "living" [...] museum than it was. [...] As at 2014 the Middleport Pottery in Burslem, which is used for commercial production, is arguably the only working Victorian pottery {{in the city of}} Stoke-on-Trent.|$|R
40|$|Polyethylene is a {{thermoplastic}} polymer {{composed of}} a repeating unit (-CH 2 -CH 2) n. It is the most consumed plastic due to its low price and ease of manufacture. It can be described by three basic characteristics that influence the processing and properties: density, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution. Principally, polyethylene is classified according to its density. The more used in the film industry are: low density polyethylene (LDPE), lineal low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Polyethylene films are produced by blow extrusion, usually from the pellets of LDPE. And one important application of these films is packaging. Shrink films are very used in the packaging industry. The film shrinks because {{a high degree of}} molecular orientation or internal stress was introduced into it during its manufacture. When the film is introduced in an oven and reheated to a temperature above its softening point the internal stresses are released, causing the film to shrink. However, these films need more studies to prevent the problems that appear during the shrink process. And this is the objective of this project: to improve the shrink process studying the heat transfer in the oven, knowing that there happen four phenomena: radiation and convection heat transfer between the oven and the film; conduction heat transfers between the film and the bottles and convection heat transfer between the <b>bottles</b> and the <b>oven.</b> The calculations have been made for four different formulations. One important fact in the shrinkage is the Blow up ratio (BUR). It is a number that refers to the ratio of a blown film bubble diameter to the extrusion die diameter. The higher the BUR, the larger the bubble diameter is in relation to the die. There are two ways to determinate the shrink-percentage. One method is by immersion of the film in an oil-bath at a chosen temperature. The other method consists in a sample introduced in a hot oven and subsequently cooled down to the room temperature. However, to calculate the shrinkage in the laboratory the samples have been heated in an oven to different temperatures (130 ÂºC, 135 ÂºC, 140 ÂºC, 190 ÂºC and 220 ÂºC) during different times, with the objective to see the percentage of shrinkage in the machine direction (MD) and the transverse direction (TD). As previously mentioned, the orientation of the film is an important aspect to the final shrinkage. For that reason, the orientation of the films in the study has been measured by an infrared spectroscopy method. The finally results of the shrinkage, the heat transfer and the orientation of the films have been related to arrive {{to the conclusion that the}} shrinkage of the film is a combined result of the film orientation, the temperature of the oven and the melting temperature of the films. And also that the important heat transfer happen just in the first 1, 9 seconds...|$|R
