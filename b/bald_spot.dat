5|$|Rick and Lori {{decide to}} do the {{operation}} without the necessary equipment. As they prepare for the operation, Shane arrives with the medical supplies, but without Otis. He claims that Otis sacrificed himself {{in order to save}} Carl. The episode flashes back to show Shane sacrificed Otis by shooting him in the leg and leaving him as bait for the walkers while he escaped with the medicine. The episode ends in the present, with Shane shaving his head, wiping out evidence of a <b>bald</b> <b>spot</b> of torn hair caused by Otis during their brief scuffle.|$|E
5|$|Meryl gets a {{voicemail}} from Sully, and Veronica {{agrees to}} track her. Veronica and Keith have another fight, with Veronica insulting his character {{for having a}} relationship with Harmony. Veronica and Meryl track the cell phone in the Fitzpatricks’ bar. Liam Fitzpatrick drunkenly picks up Veronica and carries her around, but Vinnie supposedly takes {{a picture of it}} to get him off her. Veronica and Meryl go to the police station and find that Sully washed up on shore after surfing with a bump on his head and had mild amnesia. While cleared, Mercer is still being held in custody. Keith rejects Harmony, and Logan nervously calls Keith for the whereabouts of Veronica. At the food court, Veronica is listening to voicemails from Logan and Keith when she notices an issue with her food. She returns to the counter with her plate, leaving her drink unattended. She returns to her seat but, after eating and drinking, soon feels disoriented. She recognizes this feelings as identical to her experience after ingesting GHB previously. Veronica attempts to get into her car and collapses just outside of it but she manages to set off the alarm. A mysterious figure appears and stops the alarm. There is a buzzing sound the scene cuts to a nearby Logan hearing the alarm. Logan finds Veronica's car with her unconscious on the ground next to it. He picks her up to reveal some locks of Veronica's hair on the ground and a <b>bald</b> <b>spot</b> {{on the back of her}} head.|$|E

500|$|Dudley {{was one of}} {{the first}} to publish the {{physiological}} effects of X-rays along with fellow Vanderbilt professor John Daniel. A child who had been shot in the head was brought to the Vanderbilt laboratory in 1896. Before trying to find the bullet an experiment was attempted, for which Dudley [...] "with his characteristic devotion to science" [...] volunteered. Daniel reported that 21 days after taking a picture of Dudley's skull (with an exposure time of one hour), he noticed a <b>bald</b> <b>spot</b> [...] in diameter on the part of his head nearest the X-ray tube.|$|E

50|$|The {{difference}} between a male and a female fat-tailed gerbil {{is the same as}} with other small rodents. This difference can be seen at the distance between the urinary and anal openings. The distance between these openings in male fat-tailed gerbils is much larger than it is in females. Adult males have a large bulge {{at the base of the}} tail that is their scrotum. So their testicles are clearly visible. This is totally absent from females. When the pups have an age of about 2 weeks the hairs on the belly start to grow and <b>bald</b> <b>spots</b> can be seen on the belly of the females. These are her nipples. These <b>bald</b> <b>spots</b> are absent in males.|$|R
500|$|Graves {{was badly}} {{injured in the}} 1946 {{laboratory}} criticality accident at Los Alamos that killed Louis Slotin. Slotin, who was training Graves to replace him in his position as chief bomb assembler for Los Alamos, was demonstrating the dangerous [...] "tickling the dragon's tail" [...] test to Graves and several other scientists when the accident occurred. Graves, who was nearest to Slotin, suffered an estimated dose of 390 roentgens, and was given a 50 percent chance of survival. [...] This caused severe radiation poisoning, loss of hair and a zero semen count. After two weeks of [...] hospitalization and a several weeks of convalescence, {{he seemed to have}} recovered fully, and in a few months was back at work and skiing vigorously, with only a <b>bald</b> <b>spot</b> on the head to show for the experience. Two years later he fathered a healthy child, their second, a son they named Alvin Palmer.|$|E
500|$|The {{transition}} between the top left, perhaps where the artist began, {{and the standard}} pattern, is somewhat awkward, leaving a rather <b>bald</b> <b>spot</b> (for an interlace pattern) {{to the left of}} the first curving yellow vertical. [...] The change in pattern pushes the halfway point of the upper panel rather off-centre to the right, whereas in the lower panel it falls slightly to the left of dead centre. [...] These vagaries in the design suggest that it was done freehand, without marking-out the pattern using compasses for example. [...] The lowest horizontal raised line is not straight, being higher at the left, probably because of an error in the marking or drilling of the holes in the cover board through which the ends of the cord run. [...] The simple twist or chain border in yellow between the two raised frames resembles an element in an initial in the Durham Gospel Book Fragment, an important earlier manuscript from Lindisfarne.|$|E
500|$|Although the eponymous Baker {{brothers}} are the default {{stars of the}} film, Susie {{is considered to be}} the film's [...] "centerpiece". Film critic Mike D'angelo, writing for The Dissolve, observed that [...] "the character's name is Susie Diamond, and she's written like a woman named Susie Diamond, and Pfeiffer plays her ... like a woman named Susie Diamond." [...] As a romantic film, The Fabulous Baker Boys focuses on [...] "the unfulfilled longing between" [...] bandmates Susie and Jack. Susie is the only woman capable of changing [...] "the aloof, uncommunicative Jack... by throwing incendiary tantrums and sounding even tougher than he does", slowly inspiring the pianist to change the person he has allowed himself to become. Rolling Stones Peter Travers believes that Susie and Jack bond because both characters are [...] "losers who've sold themselves on the cheap"; Jack is a skilled musician who despises himself for squandering his talent, which reminds former escort Susie of herself. Pfeiffer agreed that her character essentially becomes [...] "a mirror image for Jack" [...] although both remain very different individuals. While Jack is depicted as timid and cautious about his decisions, Susie rather [...] "embraces life" [...] instead. An adventurous individual, Susie refuses to do only one thing, including perform, for her entire life. Pfeiffer observed that although her character has spent a significant portion of her life as an escort, she remains less of a [...] "whore" [...] than Jack because she retains her individuality, while Jack [...] "has ceased to be a vital human being." [...] When Susie and Jack have their final argument, the profanity Jack uses actually helps establish Susie as the stronger character, according to Mark R. Hasan of KQEK.com. Susie's nicknames for her bandmates reveal exactly how she feels about both brothers individually; while she refers to Frank as [...] "Egghead" [...] because of his growing <b>bald</b> <b>spot</b> and tendency to act unintelligent at times, she calls Jack simply [...] "Baker" [...] because, in her opinion, [...] "there's really only one Baker brother and he's it." [...] The way Susie teases Frank is reminiscent of how Jack used to treat him several years before she joined the band when he had energy to do it.|$|E

2500|$|A {{more subtle}} but perhaps {{fundamental}} aspect to Nabokov's delineation of his characters {{is that while}} Ivanov, spiritually free, escapes the view of others, the Soviet is already trapped under the others' gaze. How their faces and appearances are revealed to others becomes a defining characteristic of their personalities. The reader is told at the very start that Razor lacks a facade, and when acquaintances tried to recall his appearance they [...] "could only imagine him in profile". Whereas {{as soon as the}} Soviet enters the barber, [...] "the newcomer's reflection appeared in all the mirrors at once, in profile, three-quarter-face, and shown the waxen <b>bald</b> <b>spot</b> in back". The point is more subtle but important nevertheless - the free man escapes the view of others while the man who denies that freedom is forever trapped in the gaze of other people.|$|E
2500|$|Detail and colour have {{a strong}} {{aesthetic}} effect in Nabokov's work, offering sharp reminders to both reader and character of the joy to be obtained from observation, however fleeting, {{of the world around}} them. Before the Soviet arrives, Ivanov observes [...] "the glittering wheels of cars that left ribbon-like imprints on the heat-softened asphalt, resembling the ornate lacework of snakes." [...] This and others are part of a joyous, seemingly childlike vision, in which inanimate objects are often anthropomorphised. The Soviet's reflection in the mirror showed that same [...] "waxen <b>bald</b> <b>spot</b> ... from which the bowler hat had ascended to snag a hat hook". Once again, it is Ivanov who is rewarded with this joyous skill of observation, watching the passersby and cars, and then inside noting the [...] "marble surfaces aglitter with green and gold scent bottles". The Soviet says and sees little in the story, another contrast that emphasises where the author's affections lie.|$|E

In a few all the hair on the scalp or all body hair is lost and loss can be permanent.|$|R
2500|$|With the {{widespread}} experimentation with x‑rays after their discovery in 1895 by scientists, physicians, and inventors came many stories of burns, hair loss, and worse in technical journals of the time. In February 1896, Professor John Daniel and Dr. William Lofland Dudley of Vanderbilt University reported hair loss after Dr. Dudley was X-rayed. A {{child who had}} been shot in the head was brought to the Vanderbilt laboratory in 1896. Before trying to find the bullet an experiment was attempted, for which Dudley [...] "with his characteristic devotion to science" [...] volunteered. Daniel reported that 21 days after taking a picture of Dudley's skull (with an exposure time of one hour), he noticed a <b>bald</b> <b>spot</b> [...] in diameter on the part of his head nearest the X-ray tube: [...] "A plate holder with the plates towards the side of the skull was fastened and a coin placed between the skull and the head. The tube was fastened at the other side at a distance of one-half inch from the hair." ...|$|E
2500|$|Resh Lakish {{interpreted}} the words [...] "Korah [...] [...] [...] took" [...] in [...] to teach that Korah took a bad bargain for himself. As the three Hebrew consonants that spell Korah's name also spell the Hebrew word for [...] "bald" [...] (kereach), the Gemara deduced {{that he was}} called Korah because he caused a <b>bald</b> <b>spot</b> to be formed among the Israelites when the earth swallowed his followers. As the name Izhar (...) in [...] derived from the same Hebrew root as the word [...] "noon" [...] ( [...] , tzohorayim), the Gemara deduced from [...] "son of Izhar" [...] that Korah was a son who brought upon himself anger hot as the noon sun. As the name Kohath (...) in [...] derived from the same Hebrew root as the word for [...] "set on edge" [...] ( [...] , kihah), the Gemara deduced from [...] "son of Kohath" [...] that Korah was a son who set his ancestors' teeth on edge. The Gemara deduced from the words [...] "son of Levi" [...] in [...] that Korah was a son who was escorted to Gehenna. The Gemara asked why [...] did not say [...] "the son of Jacob," [...] and Rabbi Samuel bar Isaac answered that Jacob had prayed not to be listed amongst Korah's ancestors in [...] where it is written, [...] "Let my soul not come into their council; unto their assembly let my glory not be united." [...] "Let my soul not come into their council" [...] referred to the spies, and [...] "unto their assembly let my glory not be united" [...] referred to Korah's assembly. As the name Dathan (...) in [...] derived from the same Hebrew root as the word [...] "law" [...] ( [...] , dat), the Gemara deduced from Dathan's name that he violated God's law. The Gemara related the name Abiram (...) in [...] to the Hebrew word for [...] "strengthened" [...] (iber) and deduced from Abiram's name that he stoutly refused to repent. The Gemara related the name On (...) in [...] to the Hebrew word for [...] "mourning" [...] ( [...] , aninah) and deduced from On's name that he sat in lamentations. The Gemara related the name Peleth (...) in [...] to the Hebrew word for [...] "miracles" [...] (pelaot) and deduced from Peleth's name that God performed wonders for him. And as the name Reuben (...) derived from the Hebrew words [...] "see" [...] (reu) and [...] "understand" [...] ( [...] , mavin), the Gemara deduced from the reference to On as a [...] "son of Reuben" [...] in that On was a son who saw and understood..
