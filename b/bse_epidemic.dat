25|$|Certified Angus Beef (CAB) in Canada and the United States is a specification-based, branded-beef {{program which}} was founded in 1978 by Angus cattle {{producers}} to increase demand for their breed of cattle, by promoting the impression that Angus cattle have consistent, high-quality beef with superior taste. The brand is owned by the American Angus Association and its 35,000 rancher members. The terms Angus Beef or Black Angus Beef are loosely and commonly misused or confused with CAB; this is especially common in the food service industry. The brand or name Certified Angus Beef cannot be legally used by an establishment that is not licensed to do so. In the UK the equivalent is Aberdeen Angus, marketed as higher quality and associated with stricter animal welfare rules.

40|$|We {{review the}} origins of backcalculation (or back projection) methods {{developed}} {{for the analysis of}} AIDS (acquired immunodeciencysyndrome) incidence data.

Adaptations required for the analysis of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) incidence included: stratication of BSE incidence by age as well as birth cohort; allowance for incomplete survival between infection and the onset of clinical signs of disease; and decomposition of the age-and time-related infection incidence into a time-dependent feed risk component and an age-dependent exposure= susceptibility function. The most recent methodological developments focus on the incorporation of data from clinically unaffected cattle screened using recently developed tests for preclinical BSE infection. Backcalculation-based predictions of future BSE incidence obtained since 1996 are examined.

40|$|Abstract Background The Age-Period-Cohort (APC) {{analysis}} is routinely used for time trend analysis of cancer incidence or mortality rates, but in veterinary epidemiology, {{there are still}} only {{a few examples of}} this application. APC models were recently used to model the French epidemic assuming that the time trend for BSE was mainly due to a cohort effect in relation to the control measures that may have modified the BSE exposure of cohorts over time. We used a categorical APC analysis which did not require any functional form for the effect of the variables, and examined second differences to estimate the variation of the BSE trend. We also reanalysed the French epidemic and performed a simultaneous analysis of Italian data using more appropriate birth cohort categories for comparison. Results We used data from the exhaustive surveillance carried out in France and Italy between 2001 and 2007, and comparatively described the trend of the epidemic in both countries. At the end, the shape and irregularities of the trends were discussed in light of the main control measures adopted to control the disease. In Italy a decrease in the epidemic became apparent from 1996, following the application of rendering standards for the processing of specific risk material (SRM). For the French epidemic, the pattern of second differences in the birth cohorts confirmed the beginning of the decrease from 1995, just after the implementation of the meat and bone meal (MBM) ban for all ruminants (1994). Conclusion The APC analysis proved to be highly suitable {{for the study of the}} trend in <b>BSE</b> <b>epidemics</b> and was helpful in understanding the effects of management and control of the disease.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an insight from epidemiology and geography on the <b>BSE</b> risk. The <b>epidemic</b> declined sharply following the ban {{of meat and}} bone meal in ruminant feed. BSE cases born after the ban and reinforced measures were due to cross-contamination between feed for monogastrics and feed for ruminants at the feed factory and on farms. Cross-contamination is difficult to control in the feed chain, particularly because contaminated material can infect cattle at very low doses. Designing separate feed processing lines or dedicating factories to ruminants is an efficient strategy, but is not economically feasible in the regions with low animal density. So, changes in control measures should target both the feed industry and farmers, and {{take into account the}} difficult economic context that limits the industry's ability to adopt the most effective solutions to prevent cross-contaminatio...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBovine spongiform encephalopathy, {{otherwise}} known as mad cow disease, can spread when an individual cow consumes feed containing the infected tissues of another individual, forming a one-species feedback loop. Such feedback is the primary means of transmission for <b>BSE</b> during <b>epidemic</b> conditions. Following outbreaks in the European Union and elsewhere, many governments enacted legislation designed to limit the spread of such diseases via elimination or reduction of one-species feedback loops in agricultural systems. However, two-species feedback loops—those in which infectious material from one-species is consumed by a secondary species whose tissue is then consumed by the first species—were not universally prohibited and have not been studied before. Here we present a basic ecological disease model which examines the rôle feedback loops may play in the spread of BSE and related diseases. Our model shows that there are critical thresholds between the infection's expansion and decrease related to the lifespan of the hosts, {{the growth rate of}} the prions, and the amount of prions circulating between hosts. The ecological disease dynamics can be intrinsically oscillatory, having outbreaks as well as refractory periods which can make it appear that the disease is under control while it is still increasing. We show that non-susceptible species that have been intentionally inserted into a feedback loop {{to stop the spread of}} disease do not, strictly by themselves, guarantee its control, though they may give that appearance by increasing the refractory period of an epidemic's oscillations.

40|$|AbstractPrion diseases, {{also called}} {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), lead to neurological dysfunction in animals and are fatal. Infectious prion proteins are causative agents of many mammalian TSEs, including scrapie (in sheep), chronic wasting disease (in deer and elk), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; in cattle), and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD; in humans). BSE, better known as mad cow disease, is among the many recently discovered zoonotic diseases. BSE cases were first reported in the United Kingdom in 1986. Variant CJD (vCJD) is a disease that was first detected in 1996, which affects humans and {{is linked to the}} <b>BSE</b> <b>epidemic</b> in cattle. vCJD is presumed to be caused by consumption of contaminated meat and other food products derived from affected cattle. The <b>BSE</b> <b>epidemic</b> peaked in 1992 and decreased thereafter; this decline is continuing sharply owing to intensive surveillance and screening programs in the Western world. However, there are still new outbreaks and/or progression of prion diseases, including atypical BSE, and iatrogenic CJD and vCJD via organ transplantation and blood transfusion. This paper summarizes studies on prions, particularly on prion molecular mechanisms, BSE, vCJD, and diagnostic procedures.

The transmission of BSE by calculation of the basic reproduction ratio R 0 was modelled. The results were verified by use of a cohort model, based on observed surveillance data. Prior to 1990, before the ban of feeding MBM to ruminants, R 0, as calculated in the process model, was above 1,coherent with a slowly progres-sing <b>BSE</b> <b>epidemic.</b> Since 1991, values of R 0 were lowat 0. 06.
