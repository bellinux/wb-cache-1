60|$|But if any {{one goes}} out to shoot crows in this way he had <b>better</b> <b>be</b> very <b>careful</b> that he has an {{excessively}} mild and unimpressible horse. For, if the horse is frightened at {{the report of the}} gun, and dashes away, and smashes the wagon, and breaks his harness, and spills everything out of the wagon into the dust, mud, and bramble-bushes, and throws the gunner heels over head into a ditch, it may be that a dead crow will hardly pay him for his trouble and expense in procuring it.|$|R

60|$|This {{was a very}} {{important}} distinction, and Rollo concluded that it <b>was,</b> after all, <b>better</b> to <b>be</b> <b>careful.</b> He watched the movements of the other passengers when the seas came, and observed the precautions which they took to guard against such accidents, and by imitating these he soon became quite adroit. The dinner took a good deal of time, as there were many courses, all served with great regularity. First, there was soup; then fish of various kinds; then all sorts of roasted meats, such as beef, mutton, chickens, and ducks, with a great variety of vegetables. Then came puddings, pies, jellies, ice creams, and preserves; and, finally, a dessert of nuts, raisins, apples, almonds, and oranges. In fact, it was a very sumptuous dinner, and what was very remarkable, when at last it was ended, and the party rose from the table {{to go back to the}} cabin, Jennie said that she had a better appetite at the end of the dinner than she had had at the beginning.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, early {{supporters}} of recognising Kosovo {{as an independent}} state included Alexandr Vondra, the Minister of European Affairs. Vondra predicted that the Czech government would eventually recognise Kosovo, saying [...] "It {{is sort of like}} dancing on eggshells, it is like handling a powder keg. In situations like this, I think it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> to <b>be</b> really <b>careful.</b> We will wait, we will evaluate the situation; there is no hurry. It will certainly not happen this week but let's be realists - we certainly won't wait for six months." [...] Both Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek and Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg eventually declared their support for recognizing Kosovo. Topolánek tried to get recognition through the cabinet of the Czech government just prior to the NATO summit in Bucharest. However, his attempt was unsuccessful because {{a significant part of the}} governing Civic Democratic Party opposed recognition.|$|R

60|$|In {{considering}} {{the charges of}} the several districts, {{in order to establish}} <b>better</b> regulations, we <b>were</b> <b>careful</b> to discriminate those incurred for troops, kept or supposed to be kept up for the defence of the country, from those of the sibbendy, servants, &c., for the cultivation of the lands and the collection of the revenues, as well as to pay attention, to such of the established customs of the country, ancient privileges of the inhabitants, and public charities, as were necessarily allowed, and appeared proper to be continued, but which, under the Nabob's government, were not only rated much higher, but had been blended under one confused and almost unintelligible title of expenses of the districts: so joined, perhaps, to afford pleas and means of secreting and appropriating great part of the revenues to other purposes than fairly appeared; and certainly betraying the utmost neglect and mismanagement, as giving latitude for every species of fraud and oppression. Such a system has, in the few latter years of the Nabob's necessities, brought all his countries into that situation from which nothing but the most rigid economy, strict observance of the conduct of managers, and the most conciliating attention to the rights of the inhabitants can possibly recover them.|$|R
40|$|Promoting more cycling in New Zealand {{is still}} an {{exercise}} fraught with much adversity, both from {{the general public and}} from decision- and policy-makers. It is therefore crucial that anyone advocating for a <b>better</b> cycling environment <b>is</b> <b>careful</b> in how they present their case, lest they end up “scoring an own goal ” or furthering existing mis-conceptions. Some key examples of this include: • Referring to “cyclists ” rather than “people who cycle”, the former often conjuring up images of a relatively small bunch of “weird ” people who only ever cycle. • Asking to “provide cycle facilities ” rather than “provide for cycling”, when many treatments that greatly benefit cyclists often involve no dedicated cycle facilities. • Publicly highlighting safety problems for cyclists in an attempt to get improvements, when the net effect may be to increase the general perception of cycling as “dangerous”. • Pushing strongly for on-road cycle provision, thus alienating the population who would prefer an off-road environment to cycle on; or vice versa. This paper will discuss some of the potential pitfalls encountered by the author over the years and try to suggest the best way forward. Other subtle examples of unintended bias against cyclists, often communicated by public officials and documents, will also be highlighted...|$|R
