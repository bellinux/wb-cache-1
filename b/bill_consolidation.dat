40|$|This paper compiles {{and compares}} recent and past {{measures}} introduced {{to contain the}} public wage bill {{in a number of}} emerging and advanced economies to assess their effectiveness in bringing down expenditure in a sustained way. In the aftermath of the financial crisis a number of countries have approved measures on the wage bill as part of fiscal consolidation efforts. These recent episodes are compared to past cases implemented in advanced economies over the period 1979 – 2009. Findings suggest that public wage <b>bill</b> <b>consolidation</b> episodes pre and post 2009 are similar in many respects. Moreover, typically countries that were able to achieve more sustained reductions in the wage bill have implemented to larger extent structural measures, and/or these measures were accompanied with substantial social dialogue and consensus...|$|E

50|$|This type of bill is {{designed}} to keep the business of government and public affairs up to date. These bills may not be substantial or controversial in party political terms.

50|$|A Government Bill can be {{introduced}} first into either House. Bills which {{begin in the}} Lords have 'Lords' suffixed to its title when in the Lords and 'HL' when in the Commons. Bills which deal primarily with taxation or public expenditure begin their passage in the Commons since the financial privileges of that House mean that it has primacy in these matters (see Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949). Conversely, bills relating to the judicial system, Law Commission <b>bills</b> and <b>consolidation</b> <b>bills</b> begin their passage in the House of Lords which by convention has primacy in these matters.|$|R

50|$|In territories with a multicameral parliament, most bills may {{be first}} {{introduced}} in any chamber. However, {{certain types of}} legislation are required, either by constitutional convention or by law, to be introduced into a specific chamber.

Conversely, bills proposed by the Law Commission and <b>consolidation</b> <b>bills</b> traditionally start in the House of Lords.|$|R

Encouraged by Broomfield's experience, an Aurora city councilman has proposed consolidation again in 2006.

Further, the bill would have allowed for the admissibility of chemical test results where the defendant driver did not consent to testing, but a valid warrant was obtained. Additionally, the bill would have allowed for the admissibility of chemical test results where the law enforcement officer misread or failed to read portions of the implied consent notice...|$|R

These were only rumors, after all, for the rotunda never knows positively what goes on in high circles; but the rotunda does figuring, too, when at length the problem is reduced to a simple equation, with Bijah Bixby as x.

50|$|On 3 November 1868 {{he became}} {{commissioner}} {{of public works}} in the Strangways ministry, but when this cabinet was reconstructed in May 1870 he was omitted. He was Mayor of Adelaide 1874-5, and on 3 June 1875 joined the second Boucaut ministry as Treasurer of South Australia, but he resigned in March 1876. On 6 June he formed his first ministry as premier and commissioner of public works. His ministry lasted until 26 October 1877, when it resigned after a constitutional struggle with the upper house, which had not been consulted about the new parliamentary buildings. The government, however, had succeeded in passing a liberalized crown lands <b>consolidation</b> <b>bill,</b> and a forward policy of public works in connexion with railways and water supply had been carried out.|$|R
60|$|And then, {{when she}} stopped at the post-office to speak to Ephraim on her way homeward in the afternoon, she heard men talking behind the partition, and she stood, as one stricken, {{listening}} beside the window. Other tidings had come {{in the shape of}} a telegram. The first rumor had been false. Brampton had not yet received the details, but the <b>Consolidation</b> <b>Bill</b> had gone into the House that morning, and would be a law before the week was out. A part of it was incomprehensible to Cynthia, but so much she had understood. She did not wait to speak to Ephraim, and she was going out again when a man rushed past her and through the partition door. Cynthia paused instinctively, for she recognized him as one of the frequenters of the station and a bearer of news.|$|R
60|$|The {{governor}} of the state is a free lance, and may be seen any afternoon walking through the park, consorting with no one. He may be recognized even at a distance by his portly figure, his silk hat, and his dignified mien. Yes, it is an old and valued friend, the Honorable Alva Hopkins, patron of the drama, and sometimes he has a beautiful young woman (still unattached) by his side. He lives in a suite of rooms at the Pelican. It is a well-known fact (among Mr. Worthington's supporters) that the Honorable Alva promised in January, when Mr. Bass retired, to sign the <b>Consolidation</b> <b>Bill,</b> and that he suddenly became open-minded in March, and has remained open-minded ever since, listening gravely to arguments, and giving much study to the subject. He is an executive now, although it is {{the last year of his}} term, and of course he is never seen either in the Throne Room or the Railroad Room. And besides, he may become a senator.|$|R
60|$|We {{have listened}} to the firing on the {{skirmish}} lines for a long time, and now the real battle is at hand. It is June, and the Legislature is meeting, and Bijah Bixby has {{come down to the}} capital at the head of his regiment of mercenaries, of which Mr. Sutton is the honorary colonel; the clans are here from the north, well quartered and well fed; the Throne Room, within the sacred precincts of which we have been before, is occupied. But there is another headquarters now, too, in the Pelican House--a Railroad Room; larger than the Throne Room, with a bath-room leading out of it. Another old friend of ours, Judge Abner Parkinson of Harwich, he who gave the sardonic laugh when Sam Price applied for the post of road agent, may often be seen in that Railroad Room from now on. The fact is that the judge is about to become famous far beyond the confines of Harwich; for he, and none other, {{is the author of the}} <b>Consolidation</b> <b>Bill</b> itself.|$|R
50|$|Changes to the {{registration}} system under the Financial Services Act 2012 which splits the Financial Services Authority into the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) took effect on 1 April 2013. The registration function for societies {{was transferred to}} the FCA while the prudential regulation of credit unions {{was transferred to the}} PRA. In September 2013, the English and Scottish Law Commissions published a draft <b>consolidation</b> <b>bill</b> and related documents for consultation. Earlier that year, the UK Treasury, which is the department responsible for legislation for societies, published a series of proposals to increase the holding limit for withdrawable share capital in societies to at least £31,000, to apply insolvency rescue procedures to societies, and to change the rules applicable to their registers of members. Draft regulations linked to that consultation were also available, having been circulated to a small number of people. Those drafts and other materials, including a private member's bill to liberalise the use of share capital by societies presented to the UK House of Lords were explained and brought together online.|$|R
