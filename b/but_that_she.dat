He {{tells them}} that Harrison {{will make a}} full {{recovery}} as well <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is transferring herself off of the X-Files. Mulder attempts to give Doggett the Apollo medallion, but Doggett insists that it be given to Harrison instead. Mulder and Scully then present it to Harrison together, who accepts it in awe.|$|E

Following the number, still depressed, Liza tells Robin that the Bonecrusher's not there <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> of his domain, <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> dead.|$|R

Upset by the violence and cruelty, Violet seeks solace from Corky. She tells Corky that she wants to make a new life for herself, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> needs her help.

5|$|According to Kate, Farrar {{had moved}} out of the family home and spurned Green's desire for an amicable separation. Kate {{stressed}} that she loved and respected her mother and that all of the children had had good relationships with her, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was angry at her father for upsetting her mother by leaving. Pressed, she acknowledged that her mother had begun to drink large quantities of alcohol. She denied that she had ever seen matches in the house and expressed surprise that Tim had not escaped by the same route she had, which was via a bedroom window onto the roof.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{visited the}} farm {{on the evening}} of Tuesday, 6 August. He told the court that his parents {{suggested}} to Sheila that evening that the boys be placed in day-time foster care with a local family. Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said she would rather stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion that the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> might have welcomed daytime help.|$|E

5|$|Dax confides in Sisko {{that she}} knows she {{is in love with}} her former wife. He tells her that Trill customs mean that if they resumed their relationship, then they would be exiled from their homeworld and their {{symbionts}} would never be joined with a new host, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will have his support either way. Kahn and Dax continue to work on the experiment, but it goes wrong and Defiant is severely damaged. Kahn is injured in the explosion, but Dax rigs a force field across a plasma fire that allows her to reach Kahn, coming to the realization that the relationship is worth exile. After returning to the station, Kahn recuperates from her injuries. She decides against resuming her relationship with Dax, and—with the experiments complete—departs with the science team, leaving Dax heartbroken.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Number 18 {{was one of}} the girls in the storage truck, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> escaped and ended up at The Pearl. Traumatized, she does not understand what Jason wants. She knows that every girl who has talked about the storage truck incident has been killed and is therefore reluctant to testify. One night Number 18 is injured in a party at the brothel and can barely walk when Jason visits. When he tells Ali about his experiences, she begs him to come home, but Jason believes he is in Bangkok by divine providence. Number 18 comes to understand that Jason is not like the other men who frequent The Pearl, and agrees to trust him and testify against the brothel ring if he can rescue her.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that the plan to rid Richter of the title was concocted by WWF Chairman Vince McMahon, who brought in Moolah after Richter refused to sign a new contract with the WWF. Richter, however, claims she was still under her original five-year contract, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> regularly had disagreements with McMahon about her compensation. She also claims that when {{she arrived at the}} arena that day, she was surprised to find Moolah backstage, as she never showed up to events at which she was not scheduled to wrestle. After the match, an infuriated Richter left the arena in her wrestling gear, took a cab to the airport, and booked herself on a flight out of New York. Afterward, she never spoke to Moolah again.|$|E

5|$|Littlefinger {{arrives at}} Runestone in the Vale, with a pet falcon for his stepson, Lord of the Eyrie Robin Arryn. When Lord of Runestone Yohn Royce asks how Sansa became married to Ramsay Bolton instead {{of at the}} Fingers, Littlefinger claims Bolton's men {{attacked}} them and kidnapped her on the way. When Royce is dubious, Littlefinger adds {{that he was the}} only person who knew of their destination, implying his guilt. He manipulates Arryn into considering executing Royce, then into giving him a second chance after he pledges his absolute loyalty. Littlefinger then tells Arryn that Sansa, his cousin, has escaped the Boltons and is taking refuge at Castle Black, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is still not safe. Arryn agrees to command Royce to lead the knights of the Vale to protect her.|$|E
5|$|Marceline {{arrives with}} Finn and Jake, and the trio learn that Simon is dying {{since he is}} over a {{thousand}} years old. As such, he wants to create a portal {{to the past and}} apologize to his fiancée Betty for making her leave him. Hambo, filled with sentimentality, {{is the key to the}} portal. Marceline, realizing that Hambo will be destroyed <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will enable her former protector to see the love of his life for one last time, agrees. The portal is opened just moments after Simon had first put on the ice crown and scared Betty. Simon from the future appears to her, explains the situation, and apologizes. Betty, realizing what has happened jumps through the portal and kisses Simon, only for the portal to close and Simon to collapse.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{difficulty}} with Bede's chronology {{on the date}} of Æthelburg's marriage, as surviving papal letters to Edwin urging him to convert imply that Eadbald only recently had become a Christian, which conflicts with Bede's chronology. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that Paulinus and Æthelburg must therefore have gone to Northumbria earlier than 624, and that Paulinus went north, not as a bishop, but as a priest, returning later to be consecrated. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting agrees with Kirby's reasoning. Another historian, Peter Hunter Blair, argues that Æthelburg and Edwin were married before 625, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{did not go to}} Northumbria until 625. If Kirby's arguments are accepted, then the date of Paulinus' consecration needs to be changed by a year, to 21 July 626.|$|E

On a sailing trip the next day, the Cohens' son, Seth (Adam Brody) reveals to Ryan that he has a crush on Summer (Rachel Bilson) and would like to sail to Tahiti with her, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> never pays him any attention. Later, Marissa leaves for the fashion show with her mother Julie (Melinda Clarke), her father Jimmy (Tate Donovan), and her younger sister Kaitlin (Shailene Woodley). The Cohens and Ryan also attend the show.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{recruits}} The Lone Gunmen to {{help him}} break into a high security research facility where he thinks he {{may be able to}} find more information on how to save Scully. Meanwhile, Skinner tries to deal directly with The Smoking Man for Scully's life, who tells him he will get back to him. Inside the facility, Mulder discovers that Dr. Scanlon works alongside several clones of Kurt Crawford. The clones show him Scully's harvested ova and tell him they are trying to save the abducted women's lives, since they acted as their birth mothers. They also hope to subvert the colonization project as an inside job. Mulder takes Scully's ova and leaves, being pursued by the Gray-Haired Man as he escapes. He returns to the hospital to see Scully, who tells him that Penny has died <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> intends to fight the disease. Afterward, Mulder phones Skinner for letting him know Scully's doing ok and may return to work soon, as well as for thanking him for his advice about not negotiating with the Smoking Man, after which Skinner and the Smoking Man come to terms on their deal in seclusion.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{brought forward}} bank statements {{that showed that}} Cisneros withdrew US$5,000 from a US$100,000 family safety deposit box on July 7, 1992 and March 3, 1993, the morning Fischer was killed. The defense stated {{that there was nothing}} illegal about visiting the safety deposit box or making the withdrawal. They stated that the US$5,000 was for a family trip to Mexico. The prosecution suggested that the money was to pay off the murderers, but they were unable to provide evidence linking the two actions. On May 11, the defense introduced two witnesses to rest their case after six days of prosecution arguments. Most of the testimonies from the prosecution that day were done by Garza, who stated that Martínez never mentioned Cisneros's name as the person of who she was working with to have Fischer killed. Garza stated that he consulted Martínez on his marriage, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would interrupt to ask him if he had found anyone who was willing to carry out her client's request and hurt Fischer. Garza claimed that he had at least four calls from phone booths in San Fernando and Matamoros, two Mexican cities. The defense stated that Garza told the FBI that he made collect calls, but Garza said they were mistaken. He said that making collect calls from Mexico was difficult, though he did not discard the possibility of having made one to Martínez. The prosecution did not enter evidence showing that Garza made calls from Mexico to the U.S., and one of the defense witness showed that Martínez's phone bill did not have any collect calls from Matamoros. The defense stated that Garza made the claim of the phone calls from Mexico to get a reduced sentence, while Garza responded that he was testifying to make sure everyone involved in the murder gets punished. The defense responded by showing the jury letters from Garza's jail stating {{that he was willing to}} cooperate with the FBI in the trial for a reduced sentence. Garza responded by saying that those letters were written by one of his English-literate inmates on his behalf. The other defense witness was a restaurateur who saw Cisneros a few hours after the murder and recalled seeing her behaving normally.|$|E
