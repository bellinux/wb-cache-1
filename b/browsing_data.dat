40|$|Economical archival and {{retrieval}} of image data {{is becoming increasingly}} important considering the unprecedented data volumes expected from the Earth Observing System (EOS) instruments. For cost effective <b>browsing</b> the image <b>data</b> (possibly from remote site), and retrieving the original image data from the data archive, we suggest an integrated image <b>browse</b> and <b>data</b> archive system employing incremental transmission. We produce our <b>browse</b> image <b>data</b> with the JPEG/DCT lossy compression approach. Image residual data is then obtained by taking the pixel by pixel differences between the original <b>data</b> and the <b>browse</b> image <b>data.</b> We then code the residual data with a form of variable length coding called diagonal coding. In our experiments, the JPEG/DCT is used at different quality factors (Q) to generate the <b>browse</b> and residual <b>data.</b> The algorithm has been tested on band 4 of two Thematic mapper (TM) data sets. The best overall compression ratios (of about 1. 7) were obtained when a quality factor of Q= 50 was used to produce <b>browse</b> <b>data</b> at a compression ratio of 10 to 11. At this quality factor the <b>browse</b> image <b>data</b> has virtually no visible distortions for the images tested...|$|R

40|$|Huge {{amounts of}} search log data have been {{accumulated}} at web search engines. Currently, a popular web search engine may every day receive billions of queries and collect tera-bytes of records about user search behavior. Beside search log data, {{huge amounts of}} <b>browse</b> log <b>data</b> have also been collected through client-side browser plug-ins. Such massive amounts of search and <b>browse</b> log <b>data</b> provide great opportunities for mining the wisdom of crowds and improving web search. At the same time, designing e↵ective and e cient methods to clean, process, and model log data also presents great challenges. In this survey, we focus on mining search and <b>browse</b> log <b>data</b> for web search. We start with an introduction to search and <b>browse</b> log <b>data</b> and an overview of frequently-used data summarizations in log mining. We then elaborate how log mining applications enhance the five major components of a search engine, namely, query understanding, document understanding, document ranking, user understanding, and monitoring & feedbacks. For each aspect, we survey the major tasks, fundamental principles, and state-of-the-art methods...|$|R

50|$|Goldfarb and Tucker (2011a) {{wrote the}} first paper to empirically study the {{economic}} effects of privacy regulation for the advertising-supported Internet. The implementation of privacy regulation in Europe has {{made it more difficult}} for firms to collect and use consumer <b>browsing</b> <b>data</b> to target their ads more accurately; the field test data shows these policies are associated with a 65 percent reduction in the influence banner ads have on purchase intent. As well as this main effect, their research also suggests that privacy regulation might change the web landscape in unanticipated ways, with advertising becoming even more intrusive. It also might lead marketers to shift their media buys away from newspapers because of difficulties in finding relevant advertising to show.|$|E
40|$|Manuscript Draft[[abstract]]Intentional <b>browsing</b> <b>data</b> is a {{new data}} {{component}} for improving Web usage mining that uses Web log files as the primary data source. Previously, the Web transaction mining algorithm was used in e-commerce applications to demonstrate {{how it could be}} enhanced by intentional <b>browsing</b> <b>data</b> on pages with item purchase and complemented by intentional <b>browsing</b> <b>data</b> on pages without item purchase. Although these two intention-based algorithms satisfactorily illustrated the benefits of intentional <b>browsing</b> <b>data</b> on the original Web transaction mining algorithm, three potential issues remain: Why is there a need to separate the source data into purchased-item and not-purchased-item segments to be processed by two intention-based algorithms? Moreover, can the algorithms contain more than one <b>browsing</b> <b>data</b> types? Finally, can the numeric intention-based data counts be more user friendly for decision-making practices? To address these three issues, we propose a unified intention-based Web transaction mining algorithm that can efficiently process the whole data set simultaneously with multiple intentional <b>browsing</b> <b>data</b> types as well as transform the intentional <b>browsing</b> <b>data</b> counts into easily understood linguistic items using the fuzzy set concept. Comparisons and implications for e-commerce are also discussed. Instead of addressing the technical innovation in this extension study, the revised intention-based Web usage mining algorithm should make its applications much easier and more useful in practice...|$|E
40|$|Some E-commerce giants (e. g., Amazon and Jingdong) with {{abundant}} purchasing data achieve highly accurate recommendations, {{since people}} {{have to pay for}} their choices and their purchasing behaviors are more qualified and valid for capturing users’ needs and preferences than other types of users’ behavior data (e. g., browsing). However, there is not enough users’ purchasing data available for most of small and medium-size E-commerce sites as well as some newly established E-commerce sites. In this paper, we aim to alleviate the sparsity of users’ purchasing data by exploiting users’ <b>browsing</b> <b>data</b> which is more sufficient. The low validity and reliability of users’ <b>browsing</b> <b>data</b> raises great challenge for accurately predicting users’ purchasing behaviors since there are many factors leading to users’ browsing behaviors. To this end, we propose a novel semi-supervised method {{to make the most of}} both high-quality purchasing data and low-quality <b>browsing</b> <b>data</b> to predict users’ purchasing behaviors. Specifically, we first use a small amount of purchasing data to supervise the model training of <b>browsing</b> <b>data,</b> and then integrate the results into the item-based collaborative filtering method. We conduct extensive experiments on a real dataset, and the experimental results show the superiority of our method by achieving 25 % improvements over traditional collaborative-filtering methods...|$|E

Faceted Browsing, {{also known}} as Faceted Search, {{recently}} became a popular interface paradigm and {{is used as a}} visual selection mechanism to <b>browse</b> <b>data</b> collections. It is particularly suitable for structured, but heterogeneous data with explicit semantics. As the amount of this data will grow in respect to a rising Semantic Web, it is worth looking at the current state of Faceted Browsers. In this paper we extract characteristics of several browsers from various domains. We then propose the use of advanced widgets for Faceted Browsers and how to select appropriate widgets...|$|R

40|$|For a {{very popular}} sales {{promotion}} tool, bundling selling, a critical issue is to decide what products can be bundled together {{in order to have}} better sales performance. Traditionally, such decision is often based on the order data collected from the POS. However, the new power of the Internet marketing allows marketers to collect not only the order data but also the <b>browsing</b> <b>data</b> and the shopping cart as well. It means that the marketers can collect information about the consumers ’ decision-making processes rather than the final shopping decisions only. This paper is motivated by finding the value of the newly collected information by comparing the performance of making decision on product bundling based on different online customer behavior data, such as order data, <b>browsing</b> <b>data,</b> or shopping cart data.
