40|$|In the {{framework}} of the BREAST-CT project funded by INFN (Committee V), the Medical Physics group of INFN Napoli has assembled a Cone-Beam Breast Computed Tomography (CBBCT) experimental scanner dedicated to X-ray CT imaging of the breast. The present system employs a tungsten anode X-ray tube, operated at 35 - 80 kVp tube voltage, with a maximum tube current of 0. 25 mA, and uses as imaging detector a CsI:Tl scintillator CMOS Flat Panel with a sensitive area of 12 cm x 12 cm with 50 micron x 50 micron pixels. The system has been tested for preliminary CT scans of cylindrical and semi-ellipsoidal PMMA objects: PMMA is used as a material with linear attenuation coefficient close to that of soft tissues for diagnostic range X-rays. The PMMA breast phantoms, either homogeneous or containing small holes for contrast and spatial resolution evaluation, have a maximum diameter of 14 cm, thus simulating the average diameter of the female breast at the chest wall. Cone-beam reconstruction is by a Feldkamp filtered-backprojection algorithm developed by the University of Pisa Medical Physics group. Tests have been conducted at varying tube voltage in order to investigate the different performance of the CT scan. Absorbed dose measurements have been carried out with TLD dosimeters placed inside the PMMA phantoms and with an ionization chamber in air. The INFN Cagliari group has developed an imaging system based on the Medipix 2, a single photon counting pixel readout ASIC for X-ray hybrid detectors, has been developed for tomography imaging applications. The ‘‘quad assembly’’ houses four Medipix 2 chips placed in a 2 _ 2 array with an active area of about 3 _ 3 cm 2. The readout system consists of four electronic cards and exploits the Medipix 2 parallel readout mode and a fast optical link based on the Glink standard, giving high flexibility and EM interference immunity over long distance connections. The overall DAQ system consists of four electronic cards. Two cards (Chipboard_ 4 C and Motherboard) form the detector stage, the third (Opt-Hub) acts as the optical link interface, while the remaining one (PCI 9054) is the PC acquisition <b>board.</b> <b>Detector</b> and PC are linked by an optical fibre channe...|$|E
40|$|Â© 2015 IEEE. OpenPET {{is an open}} source, modular, extendible, and {{high-performance}} platform {{suitable for}} multi-channel data acquisition and analysis. Due to {{the flexibility of the}} hardware, firmware, and software architectures, the platform is capable of interfacing {{with a wide variety of}} detector modules not only in medical imaging but also in homeland security applications. Analog signals from radiation detectors share similar characteristics-a pulse whose area is proportional to the deposited energy and whose leading edge is used to extract a timing signal. As a result, a generic design method of the platform is adopted for the hardware, firmware, and software architectures and implementations. The analog front-end is hosted on a module called a <b>Detector</b> <b>Board,</b> where each board can filter, combine, timestamp, and process multiple channels independently. The processed data is formatted and sent through a backplane bus to a module called Support Board, where 1 Support Board can host up to eight <b>Detector</b> <b>Board</b> modules. The data in the Support Board, coming from 8 <b>Detector</b> <b>Board</b> modules, can be aggregated or correlated (if needed) depending on the algorithm implemented or runtime mode selected. It is then sent out to a computer workstation for further processing. The number of channels (detector modules), to be processed, mandates the overall OpenPET System Configuration, which is designed to handle up to 1, 024 channels using 16 -channel <b>Detector</b> <b>Boards</b> in the Standard System Configuration and 16, 384 channels using 32 -channel <b>Detector</b> <b>Boards</b> in the Large System Configuration...|$|R

The IRFPA-family compromises the two different optical resolutions VGA (640 × 480 pixel) and QVGA (320 × 240 pixel) by using a pin-compatible <b>detector</b> <b>board.</b> The uncooled IRFPAs are designed for thermal imaging applications in the LWIR (8 [...] 14 µm) range with a full-frame frequency of 30 Hz and a high thermal sensitivity. The microbolometer with a pixel-pitch of 17 µm consists of amorphous silicon as the sensing layer. By scaling and optimizing our previous microbolometer technology with a pixel-pitch of 25 µm we enhance the thermal sensitivity of the microbolometer. The microbolometers are read out by a novel readout architecture which utilizes massively parallel on-chip Sigma-Delta-ADCs. This results in a direct digital conversion of the resistance change of the microbolometer induced by incident infrared radiation.

The new version of our data acquisition system leverages the capabilities of modern field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and puts almost all functions into the FPGA, including the FireWire elements, the embedded processor, and pulse timing and integration.

40|$|Content-based publish/subscribe (CPS) is an {{appealing}} abstraction for building scalable distributed systems, e. g., message <b>boards,</b> intrusion <b>detectors,</b> or algorithmic stock trading platforms. More recently, {{extensions of the}} abstraction have been proposed for location-based services like vehicular networks, mobile social networking, etc. Although current CPS middleware systems are dynamic {{in the way they}} support the joining and leaving of publishers and subscribers, they fall short in supporting subscription adaptations. These are becoming increasingly important across many CPS applications. In algorithmic high frequency trading, for instance, stock price thresholds that are of interest to a trader change rapidly, and gains directly hinge on the reaction time to relevant fluctuations rather than fixed values. In location-aware applications, a subscription {{is a function of the}} subscriber location (e. g. GPS coordinates) which inherently changes during motion. The common solution to adapt a subscription consists in a re-subscription, where a new subscription is issued and the superseded one canceled. This incurs substantial overhead in CPS middleware systems, and leads to missed or duplicate events during the transition. In this paper, we explore the concept of parametric subscriptions for capturing subscription adaptations. W...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} and characterize a novel biplanar diode array, and demonstrate its applicability to dosimetric QA of step-and-shoot IMRT. It {{is the first}} commercially available device of its kind specifically designed for performing measurements at varying gantry angles. The detector consists of a cylindrical PMMA phantom with two orthogonal <b>detector</b> <b>boards.</b> There are a total of 1069 p-type 1 mm wide diode detectors covering the measurement area of 20 × 20 cm 2 {{in each of the}} measurement planes. The orthogonal detector arrays ensure that the dose modulation information is not lost regardless of the beam incidence angle. For absolute calibration, the dose to the reference detector is calculated at the appropriate SSD and radiological depth by the treatment planning system and is scaled by the measured accelerator output. The directly measured rotational response on the central axis shows the maximum variation of approximately ± 3 % in the narrow ± 1 º angular intervals centered on the <b>detector</b> <b>boards.</b> This variation is reduced to less than ± 2 % outside of the four similarly centered ± 5 º angular intervals.

Of eleven IMRT plans, ten passed the γ (3 %, 3 mm) criterion at or above 95 %, while one passed at 92 %.

It contains 8 ADCs (18 bits), 512 kwords memory and an USB interface. An FPGA manages all signals from/to all components on board and generates the timing sequence for ASPIC. Its firmware is written in Verilog and VHDL languages. Internals registers permit to define various tests parameters of the ASPIC. A Labview GUI allows to load or update these registers and to check a proper operation. Several series of tests, including linearity, noise and crosstalk, have been performed over the past year to characterize the ASPIC at room and cold temperature. At present, the ASPIC, Back-End <b>board</b> and CCD <b>detectors</b> are being integrated to perform a characterization of the whole readout chain...|$|R
30|$|PET/MR {{is a new}} multi-modality {{imaging system}} which provide both {{structural}} and functional information with good soft tissue imaging ability and no ionizing radiation. In recent years, PET/MR is under major progress because {{of the development of}} silicon photomultipliers (SiPM). The goal {{of this study is to}} develop a MRI compatible PET insert based on SiPM and LYSO scintillator. The PET system was constituted by the detector ring, electronics and software. The detector ring consists of 16 detector module. The inner diameter of the ring was 151 mm, the external diameter was 216 mm, which was big enough for small animal research, e.g. rat, rabbit and tupaia. The sensor of each module was 2 * 2 SensL SPMArraySL, coupled with an array of 14 x 14 LYSO crystals, each crystal measuring 2 mm x 2 mm 10 mm. The detector was encapsulated in a copper box for light and magnetic shielding. Resister charge multiplexing circuit was used in the front end electronics. Each detector output 8 X and 8 Y position signals. One summed timing signal was extracted from the common cathode of all 64 channels. All these signals were transmitted to digital electronic board by a 3 m long coaxial cable from inside of the MR to the outside. Each digital electronic <b>board</b> handled 8 <b>detector</b> modules based on FPGA to obtain the timing, position and energy information of a single event. And then these single events were sent to the coincidence processing board to produce coincidence packets which are prepared for further processing. A 0.2 mCi 68 Ge line source was used to do the preliminary imaging test. The image was reconstructed by 3 D-OSEM algorithm. The initial result proved the system to be feasible as a PET. FDG phantom imaging and simultaneous PET/MR imaging are in progress.|$|R
40|$|The LHCb sub-detector {{electronics}} {{are organized}} around the detector in chassis or on individual boards, which requires configuration access to load or read different types of information. The experiment requires a configuration bus, capable to communicate properly on a copper line for a distance of over 100 meters, with a unique master, located {{in the control room}} which is not exposed to radiation, and up to 32 slaves implemented close to the <b>detector</b> electronics <b>boards,</b> working in a radiation sensitive environment. A complete Serial Protocol for Experiment Configuration System (SPECS) system was developed in 2005 based on PCI <b>boards</b> and <b>detector</b> mezzanines. The protocol requires 4 differential copper links over a standard Ethernet CAT 6 cable using BLVDS technology with a transfer rate of 10 Mbit/s in each direction. For PC obsolescence reasons, a new SPECS-MASTER (SPECSPCIE) is developed for the upgrade, based on the XTCA standard (full-size double-width). The SPECSPCIE board can be housed in XTCA chassis or in individual boxes. For this configuration, a COMExpress module provides all the link interfaces: Ethernet, PCIexpress, and JTAG. The board's core is the new ARRIA V GX FPGA family which implemented hard PCIexpress IP and transceivers at 3. 125 Gbps which allow direct connections with the serial links: 1 Gb Ethernet and PCIexpress 4 X GEN 2. The board has been designed as aversatile system, it integrates 16 SPECS-MASTER with individual drivers with discrete pole zero compensation and per-emphasis to allow a transfer length of up to 120 m. It also include a mezzanine HSMC connector for future development. An 8 bits microcontroller manages the XTCA startup sequence and the communication with the chassis controller (MCH) using the IPMB bus, and also the programmable power supervisor by I 2 C bus. A clock generator and jitter cleaner chip is implemented onboard and allows wide clock frequencies (40 Khz to 1. 5 Ghz) with very low jitter performance (. 35 ps RMS). This last one is configured by a SPI bus which is controlled by an on-chip NIOS CPU. To allow complex systems with easy programming an embedded uLinux system is implemented. With this configuration, we manage the Ethernet TCP/IP protocol. CPU communication is performed via PCIexpress or Ethernet link. The FPGA configuration is achieved by serial EEPROM, and reconfiguration by JTAG or by CvP (PCIexpress capability). Software libraries are available to use the SPECS System. One low level library allows users to access the master registers and to prepare and send SPECS frames to communicate with the electronics using the different modes available (I 2 C, JTAG, DMA Bus, Parallel Bus). One high level library interfaces all commonly used functionalities to write or read data directly to the electronics...|$|R
40|$|Reconstructed tomographic image {{resolution}} of small animal PET imaging systems is improving with advances in radiation detector development. However the trend towards higher resolution systems has come {{with an increase}} in price and system complexity. Recent developments in the area of solid-state photomultiplication devices like silicon photomultiplier arrays (SPMA) are creating opportunities for new high performance tools for PET scanner design. Imaging of excised small animal organs and tissues has been used as part of post-mortem studies in order to gain detailed, high-resolution anatomical information on sacrificed animals. However, this kind of ex-vivo specimen imaging has largely been limited to ultra-high resolution μCT. The inherent limitations to PET resolution have, to date, excluded PET imaging from these ex-vivo imaging studies. In this work, we leverage the diminishing physical size of current generation SPMA designs to create a very small, simple, and high-resolution prototype detector system targeting ex-vivo tomographic imaging of small animal organs and tissues. We investigate sensitivity, spatial resolution, and the reconstructed image quality of a prototype small animal PET scanner designed specifically for imaging of excised murine tissue and organs. We aim to demonstrate that a cost-effective silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) array based design with thin crystals (2 mm) to minimize depth of interaction errors might be able to achieve sub-millimeter resolution. We hypothesize that the substantial decrease in sensitivity associated with the thin crystals can be compensated for with increased solid angle detection, longer acquisitions, higher activity and wider acceptance energy windows (due to minimal scatter from excised organs). The constructed system has a functional field of view (FoV) of 40 mm diameter, which is adequate for most small animal specimen studies. We perform both analytical (3 D-FBP) and iterative (ML-EM) methods in order to reconstruct tomographic images. Results demonstrate good agreement between the simulation and the prototype. Our detector system with pixelated crystals is able to separate small objects as close as 1. 25 mm apart, whereas spatial resolution converges to the theoretical limit of 1. 6 mm (half the size of the smallest detecting element), which is to comparable to the spatial resolution of the existing commercial small animal PET systems. Better system spatial resolution is achievable with new generation SiPM <b>detector</b> <b>boards</b> with 1 mm x 1 mm cell dimensions. We demonstrate through Monte Carlo simulations {{that it is possible to}} achieve sub-millimeter spatial {{image resolution}} (0. 7 mm for our scanner) in complex objects using monolithic crystals and exploiting the light-sharing mechanism among the neighboring detector cells. Results also suggest that scanner (or object) rotation minimizes artifacts arising from poor angular sampling, which is even more significant in smaller PET designs as the gaps between the sensitive regions of the detector have a more exaggerated effect on the overall reconstructed image quality when the design is more compact. Sensitivity of the system, on the other hand, can be doubled by adding two additional detector heads resulting in a, fully closed, 4 π geometry...|$|R
