5|$|In response, SMRT {{announced}} it was replacing important engineering components on all C151 trains by 2019. This included changing the existing Mitsubishi Electric propulsion system for the newer Insulated-gate <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> (IGBT) and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) propulsion system by Toshiba, technology currently used in the Tokyo Metro's 1000 series and 16000 series trains {{as well as the}} Kyushu 305 series and Hankyu 1000 series trains. As of July 2015, train sets 055/056 and 131/132 are trialed with the new propulsion system. In tandem with the replacement of the signalling system on the East-West Line and North-South Line with the newer Thales SelTrac signalling system, new equipment are installed in the passenger compartment of the trailer cars.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 This thesis {{deals with}} 1 /f noise in p-MOS, bipolar, and lateral <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors.</b> Experimental {{measurements}} determine the appropriate 1 /f noise for MOSFET's, <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> and lateral <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors.</b> The literature on 1 /f noise in p-MOSFETs, <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> and lateral <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> is reviewed. The two {{main sources of}} low frequency 1 /f noise are mobility fluctuations and number fluctuations. Our 1 /f noise measurements in p-MOSFET's, <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors,</b> and lateral pnp <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> were done at frequencies of 1 Hz and 1 KHz respectively by both the automatic and analog methods. The measurement {{results suggest that the}} number fluctuation and mobility fluctuation models are applied for short channel and long channel p-MOSFET's in the saturation region respectively. Simulations have been done using PSPICE, with noise level NLEV= 0 and device model level 3 for long channel p-MOSFET's; with noise level NLEV= 2 and device model level 6 for short channel p-MOSFET's. Theoretical considerations as well as experimental results show {{that it is possible to}} take advantage of MOSFET and bipolar devices for low noise integrated circuit applications. Research on low frequency 1 /f noise in the different semiconductor devices is very important to determine the best semiconductor structure and best noise model for different devices. This is an especially important consideration in the development of the integrated circuits in high-density chip area, low voltage supply, low power consumption and low noise applications...|$|R

25|$|An insulated-gate <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> (IGBT) is a {{three-terminal}} {{power semiconductor}} device primarily used as an electronic switch which, as it was developed, came to combine high efficiency and fast switching. It switches electric power in many applications: variable-frequency drives (VFDs), electric cars, trains, variable speed refrigerators, lamp ballasts, air-conditioners and even stereo systems with switching amplifiers. The IGBT is a semiconductor device with four alternating layers (P-N-P-N) that are controlled by a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) gate structure without regenerative action.|$|E
25|$|Ionic bipolar {{transistors}} {{can be made}} from two conical channels with the smallest opening in nano-scaled dimension.

An ionic <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> is built by combining two ionic diodes and forming a PNP junction along the inner surface of the channel. While the ionic current is from emitter end to collector end, the strength of the current can be modulated by the base electrode. The surface charge at the channel wall can be modified using chemical methods, by changing the electrolyte concentration or pH value.|$|E

25|$|A {{phototransistor}} is a light-sensitive transistor. A {{common type}} of phototransistor, called a photobipolar transistor, is in essence a <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> encased in a transparent case so that light can reach the base–collector junction. It was invented by Dr. John N. Shive (more famous for his wave machine) at Bell Labs in 1948, {{but it was not}} announced until 1950. The electrons that are generated by photons in the base–collector junction are injected into the base, and this photodiode current is amplified by the transistor's current gain β (or hfe). If the base and collector leads are used and the emitter is left unconnected, the phototransistor becomes a photodiode. While phototransistors have a higher responsivity for light they are not able to detect low levels of light any better than photodiodes. Phototransistors also have significantly longer response times. Field-effect phototransistors, also known as photoFETs, are light-sensitive field-effect transistors. Unlike photobipolar transistors, photoFETs control drain-source current by creating a gate voltage.|$|E
25|$|In May 1952, Sidney Darlington filed {{a patent}} {{application}} in the United States for a structure {{with two or}} three transistors integrated onto a single chip in various configurations; in October 1952, Bernard Oliver filed a patent application for a method of manufacturing three electrically connected planar transistors on one semiconductor crystal. On May 21, 1953, Harwick Johnson filed a patent application for a method of forming various electronic components – transistors, resistors, lumped and distributed capacitances – on a single chip. Johnson described three ways of producing an integrated one-transistor oscillator. All of them used a narrow strip of a semiconductor with a <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> on one end and differed in the methods of producing the transistor. The strip acted as a series of resistors; the lumped capacitors were formed by fusion whereas inverse-biased p-n junctions acted as distributed capacitors. Johnson did not offer a technological procedure, and it is not known whether he produced an actual device. In 1959, a variant of his proposal was implemented and patented by Jack Kilby.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{electrothermal}} {{behavior of}} single- and two-finger <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> at medium- and high-current operations is studied through theoretical modeling, experimental measure-ments, and computer simulations. Bias conditions that border thermally stable and unstable operation regimes are described by novel analytical formulations, {{which for the}} first time include si-multaneously all relevant parameters that weaken the electrother-mal feedback at high currents such as ballasting resistors, current dependence of the base–emitter-voltage temperature coefficient, and high-injection effects. Hence, besides giving a correct de-scription of thermal instability mechanisms, the developed formu-lations also allow the prediction and physical understanding of restabilization phenomena. The models are supported by measure-ments on silicon-on-glass n-p-n <b>bipolar</b> junction <b>transistors</b> and by simulation results from a novel SPICE-based electrothermal macromodel for <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors.</b> Furthermore, the models are employed to analyze the influence of the germanium percentage in the base of SiGe heterojunction <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> on the thermal ruggedness of the device.
