40|$|Abstract. The failure {{assessment}} for the defects in multiple corroded region {{has been considered}} with the real-size pipeline <b>burst</b> <b>tests</b> and the associated Finite Element Method. The corroded gas pipeline made of X 65 steel with various types of artificially machined pits {{has been used for}} a number of series of <b>burst</b> <b>tests</b> on gas pipeline. The failure pressures for the designed multiple corroded defect on gas pipelines have been measured by using in-situ <b>burst</b> <b>testing</b> and classified with respect to each designed defect sizes- length, width and depth- and distance between defects. The result from the experiments has been modeled and compared with Finite Element Method. As the result of FEM simulation, the failure pressure in multiple defects is lower than that in single defect, and closer to failure pressure in single defect of total length of defects in multiple defects as the distance between each defect is closer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThin-walled tubing used {{in various}} {{structures}} {{are made of}} low c/a-ratio hcp metals such as Zr and Ti based alloys, and their integrity to internal pressures is of prime importance {{in the life of}} these engineering structures. We summarize here ome of the work performed on Zircaloy cladding commonly used in LWRs as thin walled tubing as well as Cp-Ti and Ti 3 Al 2. 5 V that find applications in aerospace industry. Considered here are three different types of tests: (i) <b>burst</b> <b>tests</b> using closed- end internal pressurization, (ii) uniaxial ring tests for characterization of hoop creep properties and (iii) hoop creep under biaxial internal pressurization. <b>Burst</b> and ring <b>tests</b> yielded identical hoop creep and rupture characteristics indicating the utility of ring <b>tests</b> to replace <b>burst</b> <b>tests.</b> Importance of transitions in creep mechanisms with decreased stress levels in predicting in-service dimensional changes is emphasized...|$|R
40|$|Sine <b>burst</b> <b>tests</b> {{are often}} used for {{structural}} qualification of space flight hardware. In most instances, the driving frequency of the shaker is specified far below the structure's first resonant mode, such that the entire test article sees uniform acceleration. For large structures, this limits qualification testing to lower parts of the structure, or else it over-tests the lower structure to achieve qualification of the upper structure. The WindSat payload, a 10. 5 foot tall graphite/epoxy, titanium, and aluminum radiometer, experiences accelerations at the six foot diameter reflector nearly four times that at the spacecraft interface. Due to size of the payload, the number of bonded joints, and the lightweight reflector support structure design and construction, using static pull testing to qualify all of the bonded joints in the upper structure would result in large, expensive, and extensive <b>test</b> fixturing. Sine <b>burst</b> <b>testing</b> near the first two structural resonant modes {{was performed on the}} WindSat payload to achieve the correct load factor distribution up the stack for structural qualification. In this presentation, how finite element method (FEM) sine burst predictions were used in conjunction with low level random and sine <b>burst</b> <b>tests</b> to achieve correct qualification test load factor distribution on the WindSat payload is discussed. Also presented is the risk mitigation approach for using the uncorrelated FEM in this procedure...|$|R

High-energy electronic ignition and mandatory catalytic converter were added; also a Pulse Air system, functionally {{the same as}} an air pump but without the pump's six-horsepower loss. A larger catalytic converter further guarded against power loss. More advanced ignition timing, and the lead-free fuel required with the converter, prevented exhaust-valve failure.

From total blood, neutrophils can be purified and the NADPH oxidase activity can be measured with different methods in these cells after activation.Phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear neutrophils and monocytes constitutes an essential arm of host defense against bacterial or fungal infections. The phagocytic process can be separated into several major stages: chemotaxis (migration of phagocytes to inflammatory sites), attachment of particles to the cell surface of phagocytes, ingestion (phagocytosis) and intracellular killing by oxygen-dependent (oxidative burst) and oxygen-independent mechanisms.|$|E
40|$|The DWPF {{canister}} closure {{system uses}} resistance welding for sealing the canister nozzle and plug to ensure leak tightness. The welding group at SRTC {{is using the}} <b>burst</b> <b>test</b> to qualify this seal weld {{in lieu of the}} shear test in ASME B&PV Code, Section IX, paragraph QW- 196. The <b>burst</b> <b>test</b> is considered simpler and more appropriate than the shear test for this application. Although the geometry, loading and boundary conditions are quite different in the two tests, structural analyses show similarity in the failure mode of the shear test in paragraph QW- 196 and the <b>burst</b> <b>test</b> on the DWPF canister nozzle Non-linear structural analyses are performed using finite element techniques to study the failure mode of the two tests. Actual test geometry and realistic stress strain data for the 304 L stainless steel and the weld material are used in the analyses. The finite element models are loaded until failure strains are reached. The failure modes in both tests are shear at the failure points. Based on these observations, it is concluded that the use of a <b>burst</b> <b>test</b> in lieu of the shear test for qualifying the canister-plug weld is acceptable. The <b>burst</b> <b>test</b> analysis for the canister-plug also yields the burst pressures which compare favorably with the actual pressure found during burst tests.

Fatigue and <b>burst</b> <b>tests</b> were performed on large pipeline sections containing natural and artificial metal loss defects, seam and girth welds including weld defects (“NOT PASSED” quality). <b>Burst</b> <b>tests</b> were executed after fatigue tests, using 100. 000 cycles.

40|$|We have {{evaluated}} the microstructural/mechanical, and thermal shock/fatigue behavior and have conducted stress analyses of hot-gas candle filters made by various manufacturers. These filters include both monolithic and composite ceramics. Mechanical-property {{measurement of the}} composite filters included diametral compression testing with O-ring specimens and <b>burst</b> <b>testing</b> of short filter segments using rubber plug. In general, strength values obtained by <b>burst</b> <b>testing</b> were lower than those obtained by O-ring compression testing. During single-cycle thermal-shock tests, the composite filters showed little or no strength degradation when quenched from temperatures between 900 and 1000 {degrees}C. At higher quenching temperatures, slow strength degradation was observed. The monolithic SiC filters showed no strength degradation when quenched from temperatures of up to {approx} 700 - 900 {degrees}C, but displayed decreased strength at a relatively sharp rate when quenched from higher temperatures. On the other hand, a recrystallized monolithic SiC filter showed higher initial strength and retained this strength to higher quenching temperatures than did regular SiC filters. This {{may be related to}} the difference in strength of grain boundary phases in the two cases. In thermal cycles between room temperature and 800 - 1000 {degrees}C, both monolithic and composite filters show a small strength degradation up to three cycles, beyond which the strength remained unchanged. Results of rubber-plug <b>burst</b> <b>testing</b> on composite filters were analyzed to determine the anisotropic elastic constants of the composite in the hoop direction. When these results are combined with axial elastic constants determined from axial tensile tests, the composite can be analyzed for stress due to mechanical (e. g., internal pressure) or thermal loading (thermal shock during pulse cleaning). The stresses can be compared with the strength of the composite to predict filter performance...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecently several leak {{accidents}} occurred due to {{girth weld}} defects in long distance transmission pipelines of PetroChina. To avoid possible failure accidents, in-line inspections {{were performed on}} some certain pipelines. In some new built pipelines, a large quantity of girth weld defects were detected in the inspections. Many fitness-for-service (FFS) assessment methods have been proposed for various kinds of metal loss in pipeline, however, it is still difficult to obtain a confident assessment of girth weld defects.
