5|$|Although some guides {{indicate}} {{the species is}} edible with suitable preparation (such as boiling), it is generally not recommended for consumption <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of confusion with other toxic Gyromitra species that contain the compound gyromitrin. When boiled in water, or digested in the body, this compound is readily hydrolyzed to the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine—used as a propellant in some rocket fuels.|$|E
5|$|The Johns Hopkins Hospital {{protocol}} for initiating the ketogenic diet {{has been widely}} adopted. It involves a consultation with the patient and their caregivers and, later, a short hospital admission. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of complications during ketogenic diet initiation, most centres begin the diet under close medical supervision in the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Although it was {{cut short}} by Roosevelt's desire to have him testify before Congress on Lend-Lease, Willkie's visit to Britain was deemed a triumph. Willkie also went to Ireland, hoping to persuade Éamon de Valera to abandon neutrality, but his urging was unavailing. Willkie left London for Washington on February 5; <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of being shot down by Nazi aircraft, the {{roundabout}} journey home took four days. He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 11, and his support was key to passing Lend-Lease.|$|E
25|$|The {{report also}} {{concluded}} that, despite these advantages, public authorities will not commit to building PRT <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> {{associated with being}} the first public implementation.|$|R
30|$|Intuitively, {{inflation}} {{should increase}} inefficiencies <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> associated with uncertainties. This expectation {{is consistent with}} evidence that inflation increases interest rates margins in SSA (Ahokpossi 2013, p. 19).|$|R
50|$|In 2006, the Bollywood film Fanaa, portraying {{places in}} Kashmir, was filmed at Zakopane, mainly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> {{associated}} with insurgency in Kashmir, as well due to some similarities {{in a mountain}} landscape.|$|R
5|$|Common {{side effects}} include an upset stomach. More {{significant}} side effects include stomach ulcers, stomach bleeding, and worsening asthma. Bleeding risk is greater {{among those who}} are older, drink alcohol, take other NSAIDs, or are on blood thinners. Aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy. It is not generally recommended in children with infections <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of Reye's syndrome. High doses may result in ringing in the ears.|$|E
5|$|Despite its problems, the {{locomotive}} displayed outstanding steaming characteristics and total traction {{from the two}} power bogies on its trial runs. When properly fired, the Leader was capable of {{keeping up with the}} schedules, even running ahead on occasions. However, operational difficulties when stopping for water tended to lose any time advantages gained and affected the published performance figures. Despite hauling test trains over the Central Section of the former Southern Railway, the Leader prototype was never used on a revenue-earning service <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of failure of the valve gear and the adverse publicity this would cause for British Railways.|$|E
5|$|Exsudoporus frostii {{mushrooms}} can {{be recognized}} by their dark red sticky caps, the red pores, the network-like pattern of the stipe, and the bluing reaction to tissue injury. Another characteristic of young, moist fruit bodies is the amber-colored drops exuded on the pore surface. Although the mushrooms are considered edible, they are generally not recommended for consumption <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of confusion with other poisonous red-pored, blue-bruising boletes. E.frostii may be distinguished from other superficially similar red-capped boletes by differences in distribution, associated tree species, bluing reaction, or morphology.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, {{lighting}} circuits {{are protected}} with a 5A fuse or 6A miniature circuit breaker. Wiring regulations in the UK {{and some other}} countries no longer approve lampholder plugs <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> overheating and fire.|$|R
50|$|Dunking is {{much less}} common in women's {{basketball}} than in men's play. Dunking is slightly more common during practice sessions, but many coaches advise against it in competitive play <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> injury or failing to score.|$|R
50|$|Allerford New Bridge {{which carries}} the A39 road past {{the village is}} also a Scheduled Ancient Monument and Grade II* listed building. It is also on <b>the</b> Heritage at <b>Risk</b> {{register}} <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> vehicle damage and erosion.|$|R
5|$|Mercury readily {{combines}} with aluminium {{to form a}} mercury-aluminium amalgam {{when the}} two pure metals come into contact. Since the amalgam destroys the aluminium oxide layer which protects metallic aluminium from oxidizing in-depth (as in iron rusting), even small amounts of mercury can seriously corrode aluminium. For this reason, mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the timber}} was reburied {{as the best}} way of {{preserving}} it, and a survey in 2005 found this to have been quite successful, despite reports warning of the area drying out and the peat coverage being reduced. The site is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> to the buried timbers if the site dries out further.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosion}} {{was caused}} by a gas leak in a 30-year-old building. It severely damaged a nearby nine-story apartment building, causing it to collapse. Mónica Fein, mayor of Rosario, asked residents to avoid the area <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> that more buildings might collapse, and to ease the work of disaster management personnel. The streets were covered with broken glass from damaged buildings. Gas and electricity were immediately disconnected, and the national government sent an Argentine Federal Police task force to the scene.|$|E

50|$|Lamarca {{was married}} to Maria Pavan, who was his foster sister, and had two {{children}} with her. His wife went into exile in Cuba <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> she was facing in Brazil. Lamarca also became romantically linked to Yara Yavelberg, a partner in his anti-dictatorship activities.|$|R
50|$|Nuclear power reduces carbon emissions. Although a very viable resource, {{nuclear power}} can be a {{controversial}} solution <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> associated with it. Another factor in the debate with nuclear power is that many people or companies simply do not want any nuclear energy plant or radioactive waste near them.|$|R
5|$|The {{invasion}} {{occurred on}} the early morning of March 25, 2008. The main towns were quickly overrun and the island was declared {{under the control of}} the invading forces the same day. Mohamed Bacar managed to escape to Mayotte on March 26 and requested political asylum. He was subsequently held in custody there by the French administration and brought to the island of Réunion. On May 15, France rejected Bacar's request for asylum but the French refugee office ruled that the ousted leader could not be extradited to the Comoros <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of persecution.|$|E
5|$|Animals are {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} diseases and conditions that may affect their health. Some, like classical swine fever and scrapie are specific to one type of stock, while others, like foot-and-mouth disease affect all cloven-hoofed animals. Where the condition is serious, governments impose regulations on import and export, on the movement of stock, quarantine restrictions and the reporting of suspected cases. Vaccines are available against certain diseases, and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate. At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but this practice is now frowned on in many countries <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> that it may lead to antibiotic resistance. Animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of sea lice are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland. Reducing the parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.|$|E
5|$|Each 3milliliter dose lasts {{approximately}} 30minutes. Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths {{and continues}} {{for several minutes}} after stopping inhalation. The maximum recommended dose is 6milliliters per day or 15milliliters per week <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of cumulative dose-related nephrotoxicity, and {{it should not be}} used on consecutive days. Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects {{have been reported in the}} literature when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6milliliters) used for producing analgesia and sedation. Due to the risk of organ (especially renal) toxicity, methoxyflurane is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended to be administered in conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs.|$|E
50|$|The {{capability}} to replicate information with ease, changing it between contexts and applications, involves privacy concerns <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> disclosure when handling sensitive information.

5|$|Laubenstein {{developed}} appendicitis in 1984 and {{was afraid}} to undergo surgery <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> that general anesthesia would pose to her lungs, already compromised from polio. After the operation, her surgeons had trouble weaning her off the ventilator and she suffered a psychotic breakdown requiring admission to a psychiatric hospital; the psychiatrists theorized that her hallucinations were caused by hypoxia from the anesthesia. In 1990, she fell ill {{with a combination of}} asthma, gastroenteritis and respiratory failure, though she continued to work. She started taking corticosteroids for her respiratory problems—which were exacerbated by allergies to her two pet cats—and was unable to wean herself off them despite experiencing side effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of {{visitors}} at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers and little terns, and also for wintering geese. During the breeding season, the main breeding areas for terns and seals are fenced off and signposted. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle. A boardwalk made from recycled plastic crosses the large sand dunes {{near the end of}} the Point, which helps to reduce erosion. It was installed in 2009 at a cost of £35,000 to replace its much less durable wooden predecessor. Dogs are not allowed from April to mid-August <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> to ground-nesting birds, and must be on a lead or closely controlled at other times.|$|E

50|$|Although {{antidepressants}} {{were used}} by child and adolescent psychiatrists to treat major depressive disorder, they may not always {{have been used in}} young people with a comorbid conduct disorder <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> overdose in such a population. Tricyclic antidepressant were the predominant antidepressants used at that time in this population. With <b>the</b> advent <b>of</b> selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), child and adolescent psychiatrists probably began prescribing more anti-depressants in the co-morbid conduct disorder/major depressive group <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> serious harm in overdose. This raises the possibility that more effective treatment of these young people might also improve their outcomes in adult life.|$|R
50|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> surgery, and <b>because</b> about 35% <b>of</b> people require {{at least}} one more surgery, many people try vision therapy first. This {{consists}} of visual exercises. Although vision therapy is generally not covered by American health insurance companies, many large insurers such as Aetna have recently begun offering full or partial coverage in response to recent studies.|$|R

5|$|Liver {{transplantation}} is {{an effective}} cure for Wilson's disease but is used only in particular scenarios <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> and complications associated with the procedure. It is used mainly in people with fulminant liver failure who fail to respond to medical treatment or in those with advanced chronic liver disease. Liver transplantation is avoided in severe neuropsychiatric illness, in which its benefit has not been demonstrated.|$|R
