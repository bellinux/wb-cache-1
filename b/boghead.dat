Billy Kirkwood then signed yet another former Rangers player, Gary McSwegan, from Notts County, and he made his debut in the 1–0 defeat to Dumbarton at <b>Boghead</b> Park. Goals seemed {{to be hard to}} come by in the league, so Kirkwood brought yet another striker to Tannadice. Owen Coyle arrived from Bolton Wanderers and scored on his debut in a 2–1 win over St Johnstone at Tannadice. McSwegan scored his first goal for the club in a 1–0 away win over Hamilton, and both strikers scored in a 3–1 win over Dunfermline at Tannadice.

25|$|The goals {{kept coming}} {{at the start}} of April, as Gary McSwegan grabbed 4 goals in a 6–1 win over Dumbarton at Tannadice. Since that 1–0 defeat at <b>Boghead</b> six months previously, United had scored 17 goals against Dumbarton in 3 games. Just as United looked to be running away with the league, they lost another {{important}} three points with a 1–0 defeat to St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park. a 2–0 victory away to Hamilton put United back in the driving seat, and with two games left, United had to play their two nearest challengers. With a one-point advantage, United faced Dunfermline at Tannadice, and with a crowd of 12,000 turning up expecting to see United clinch the title, Dunfermline left with a 1–0 win. That defeat left United two points behind Dunfermline, and the final game of the season was against third-placed Morton. In front of over 12,000, United managed a 2–2 draw to pip Morton to 2nd place on goal difference and secure the play-off place.|$|E

These plans are on show at the Scottish Football Museum at Hampden Park, but were never put into practice by the club.
