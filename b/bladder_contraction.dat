Based upon the nonselective tolterodine, the highly M- 2 -selective (R) - 4 -{ 2 -[3 -(4 -methoxy-benzoylamino) -benzyl]-piperidin- 1 -ylmethyl}piperi dine- 1 -carboxylic acid amide (Ro- 320 - 6206), and the highly M- 3 -selective darifenacin and 3 -(1 -carbamoyl- 1, 1 -diphenylmethyl) - 1 -(4 -methoxyphenylethyl) pyrrolidine (APP), contraction occurs via M- 3 receptors. The phospholipase C inhibitor 1 -(6 -[([17 beta]- 3 -methoxyestra- 1, 3, 5 [10]-trien- 17 -yl) -amino]hexyl) - 1 H-py rrole- 2, 5 -dione (U 73, 122) (1 - 10 muM) did not significantly affect carbachol-stimulated <b>bladder</b> <b>contraction.</b> The phospholipase D inhibitor butan- 1 -ol relative to its negative control butan- 2 -ol (0. 3 % each) caused small but detectable inhibition of carbachol-induced <b>bladder</b> <b>contraction.</b> The Ca 2 + entry blocker nifedipine (10 - 100 nM) strongly inhibited carbachol-induced <b>bladder</b> <b>contraction.</b> In contrast, 1 -[beta-[3 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) propoxy]- 4 -methoxyphenethyl]- 1 H-imidazole HCl (SK&F 96, 365) (1 - 10 muM), an inhibitor of store-operated Ca 2 + channels, caused little inhibition.

40|$|Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) and {{neurological}} diseases can cause lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction, significantly disrupting normal urine storage (continence) and efficient bladder emptying (micturition). Electrical stimulation of pudendal afferents is a promising technique to treat LUT dysfunction and restore bladder control via stimulation-evoked bladder inhibition or activation. However, innovative approaches are needed, as the voiding efficiencies produced by traditional pudendal afferent stimulation are insufficient for successful clinical translation. The {{objective of this}} dissertation {{was to investigate the}} effects of novel patterns of electrical stimulation on the size of <b>bladder</b> <b>contractions</b> and voiding efficiencies produced by pudendal afferent stimulation and to explore the neural mechanisms underlying stimulation-evoked reflex bladder control. This work quantified the magnitude of <b>bladder</b> <b>contractions</b> and voiding efficiency evoked by spatial and temporal patterns of pudendal afferent stimulation in &# 945;-chloralose anesthetized cats. Bilateral stimulation of the dorsal genital nerve (DGN) and co-stimulation of the DGN and cranial sensory nerve (CSN) generated significantly larger isovolumetric <b>bladder</b> <b>contractions</b> and increased voiding efficiencies as compared to individual stimulation and distention-evoked voiding. The temporal pattern of DGN stimulation significantly affected the magnitude of evoked <b>bladder</b> <b>contractions,</b> revealing that the bladder response to pudendal afferent stimulation is dependent on the pattern of stimulation, as well as the frequency. The effects of intraurethral co-stimulation, combining individual stimulation sites in the proximal and distal urethra, on bladder activation and the electromyographic (EMG) activity of pelvic floor muscles were measured during urodynamics in persons with SCI. The size of stimulation-evoked <b>bladder</b> <b>contractions</b> was dependent on stimulation location and frequency, reflex EMG activity suggested that multiple reflex pathways contributed to bladder activation, and co-stimulation produced larger isovolumetric <b>bladder</b> <b>contractions</b> than single site stimulation. Pharmacological block of inhibitory neurotransmitters was conducted to identify the mechanism of bladder inhibition evoked by pudendal afferent stimulation in &# 945;-chloralose anesthetized cats. Low frequency pudendal afferent stimulation-evoked bladder inhibition was blocked by picrotoxin, revealing that this requires a lumbosacral spinal GABAergic mechanism, and further pharmacological experiments indicated that glycinergic, adrenergic, or opioidergic mechanisms were not necessary for pudendal afferent stimulation evoked inhibition. A computational model of the pudendo-vesical reflex and was developed based on previous neuroanatomical and electrophysiological studies to evaluate mechanisms underlying the bladder response to pudendal afferent stimulation. The frequency and pattern-dependent effects of pudendal afferent stimulation were determined by changes in firing rate of spinal interneurons in the model, suggesting that neural network interactions at the lumbosacral level can mediate the bladder response to different frequencies or temporal patterns of pudendal afferent stimulation. The effects and mechanisms of patterned pudendal afferent stimulation represent a substantial improvement in our understanding of pudendal afferent stimulation and will be valuable for the continued development of novel methodologies of electrical stimulation for bladder control.

Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were used. At 4 wk after Th 9 - 10 SCT, simultaneous recordings of intravesical pressure and urethral pressure were performed under an awake condition to {{examine the effect of}} intrathecal application of GABAA and GABAB agonists (muscimol and baclofen, respectively) or GABAA and GABAB antagonists (bicuculline and saclofen, respectively) at the level of L 6 -S 1 spinal cord. In spinal-intact rats, the effects of bicuculline and saclofen on bladder and urethral activity were also examined. During urethral pressure measurements, DSD characterized by urethral pressure increases during isovolumetric <b>bladder</b> <b>contractions</b> were observed in 95 % of SCT rats. However, after intrathecal application of muscimol or baclofen, urethral pressure showed urethral relaxation during isovolumetric <b>bladder</b> <b>contractions.</b> The effective dose to induce inhibition of urethral activity was lower compared with the dose that inhibited <b>bladder</b> <b>contractions.</b> The effect of muscimol and baclofen was antagonized by intrathecal bicuculline and saclofen, respectively. In spinal-intact rats, intrathecal application of bicuculline induced DSD-like changes. These results indicate that GABAA- and GABAB-receptor activation in the spinal cord exerts the inhibitory effects on DSD after SCT. Decreased activation of GABAA receptors due to hypofunction of GABAergic mechanisms in the spinal cord might be responsible, at least in part, for the development of DSD after SCT...|$|R

Eight patients with untreated coeliac disease and nine controls received intravenous infusions of the pure synthetic cholecystokinin analogue caerulein, 2 - 16 ng/kg/hour. Gall bladder emptying was measured on a minute-by-minute basis using 99 mTc-HIDA scans. In the patients with coeliac disease, gall bladder emptying was greatly decreased (34. 6 +/- 9. 9 v 61. 5 +/- 7. 5 % at 60 minutes, p less than 0. 02), and a much greater dose of caerulein was needed to initiate gall <b>bladder</b> <b>contraction</b> (3. 80 +/- 1. 08 v 1. 49 +/- 0. 56 ng/kg, p less than 0. 02). These results suggest that the abnormal gall <b>bladder</b> <b>contraction</b> in coeliac disease is not simply because of impaired release of cholecystokinin. Although mechanical factors secondary to the increased gall bladder size in patients with coeliac disease might to some extent account for the findings, the alternative explanation is that the gall bladder muscle is for some reason resistant to the action of cholecystokinetic agents.
