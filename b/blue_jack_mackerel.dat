50|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus picturatus) is {{a species}} of mackerel-like fish in the family Carangidae. Their maximum {{reported}} length is 60 cm, with a common length of 25 cm. They are coastal fish found at depths to 370 m off the Bay of Biscay to south Morocco and the western Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} first scientifically {{described}} by William Orville Ayres in 1855 {{based on the}} holotype specimen taken from San Francisco Bay, California. He named the species Caranx symmetricus, correctly identifying {{its relationship to the}} jacks, but incorporating it into what was later found to be the wrong genus. The fish was redescribed in 1944 under a different name, Decapterus polyaspis, from a specimen caught in Oregon, which under the ICZN rules classifies as a junior synonym, and it is therefore discarded. In 1983, C. symmetricus was transferred to Trachurus symmetricus by William N. Eschmeyer and Earl Herald. The species has twice been treated as a subspecies; once as Trachurus picturatus symmetricus (a subspecies of the <b>blue</b> <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel),</b> and the second more commonly used subspecies of Trachurus symmetricus symmetricus. For many years, the latter was accepted as a valid combination, with Trachurus symmetricus murphyi considered to be a southern subspecies population. Mitochondrial DNA analysis has now confirmed these subspecies to be separate species, with T. s. murphyi now simply Trachurus murphyi, the Inca scad. The divergence time of these two species was deemed relatively recent, at around 250 000 years ago.|$|E

Twelve nests of {{each species}} were fenced and prey deliveries to chicks of both species were observed during three diurnal periods {{each day for}} 35 days. We identified all prey offered to chicks, registered whether chicks ingested prey or not and weighed chicks daily. <b>Blue</b> <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus picturatus) and Atlantic sauri (Scomberosox sauri and Nanicthys simulans) were the main prey items offered to chicks by Roseate Terns, whereas Common Terns offered mainly <b>blue</b> <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> and boarfish (Capros aper). The number of Atlantic sauri offered to chicks with more than 6 days old by both tern species decreased markedly, and the inverse occurred for <b>blue</b> <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> and boarfish. Overall, non-ingested prey items were larger than those that were ingested, especially for chicks aged 1 - 12 days. Roseate Tern chicks showed a higher acceptance rate (frequency of prey ingested/frequency of prey offered) than did the Common Tern chicks. Acceptance rate of the chicks increased with chick age for both tern species but, overall, Roseate Tern adults made a better adjustment of prey delivered to chicks (in particular those aged 1 - 12 days) than did the Common Terns. The breeding strategy of the Roseate Tern might reflect a greater specialization on favourable marine fish species...|$|E

Fish were identified from flesh, otoliths and vertebrae and cephalopods from flesh and lower beaks. The frequency of occurrence of prey taxa, and the numerical frequency of fish and cephalopods, showed marked variations both spatially, across the breeding cycle and between years. Overall, cephalopods from 37 species representing 17 families and fish from 33 species representing 18 families were identified, representing over 70 prey species and trebling what was previously known.

40|$|The {{populations of}} marine pelagic fishes, in {{particular}} the migratory ones as the Trachurus picturatus (Bowdich 1825), may be erroneously considered an homogenous population unit because they show broad geographic distributions, large population sizes and high migratory movements. The <b>blue</b> <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel,</b> T. picturatus is widely distributed in the NE Atlantic and {{also found in the}} Mediterranean and Black Seas. It is an economically important resource in the Macaronesian islands of Azores, Madeira and Canaries, but despite its fishery value and ecological importance, fluctuations in the landings are difficult to explain since studies regarding the population dynamics, stocks structure, fish movements and habitat connectivity are inexistent. Moreover, genetic methods that can act as a complementary tool for stock identification and population dynamics have never been applied to this species. The <b>blue</b> <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> was sampled by artisanal fleets in the Islands of Azores, Madeira and Canaries, and at the Portuguese mainland - Matosinhos, Peniche and Portimão -during the spring-summer of 2013. A tissue sample was taken from each individual and stored in 96 % ethanol for molecular analysis. Total DNA was successfully extracted, followed by a Polymerase Chain Reaction amplification of part of the cytochrome b gene (Cyt b). Amplifications and sequencing of the Cyt b gene were carried out using published primers used for the Carangidae family (Cárdenas et al. 2005). Sequences from Greece and Turkey, available on GenBank, were added to our sequences and all analysed together. In total 46 sequences were analysed, including the closely related outgroup (Trachurus Trachurus). Preliminary results show that there are sequences in the GenBank that are incorrectly assigned to this species. In addition, within the samples collected one was proven to be T. Trachurus. Preliminary phylogeographic analyses revealed a very shallow phylogenetic tree and a star-like haplotype network, with haplotypes shared among populations.

40|$|South Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Trachurus murphyi, has an ocean-scale distribution, {{from the}} South American {{coastline}} to New Zealand and Tasmania. This fish, captured by Humans since the Holocene, is nowadays heavily exploited and its population has decreased substantially since the mid- 1990 s. The uncertainty associated to <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> population structure currently hampers management. Several hypotheses {{have been proposed}} from a single population up to several discrete populations. Still no definitive answer was given. Determining how environmental conditions drive <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> distribution can provide insights on its population structure. To do so, here we performed in three steps. First, we used satellite data to develop a statistical model of <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> horizontal habitat suitability. Model predictions based on interaction between temperature and chlorophyll-a match the observed <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> distribution, even during extreme El Niño event. Second, we studied the impact of oxygen and show that <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> distribution and abundance is correlated to oxygen over {{a wide variety of}} scales and avoid low oxygen areas and periods. Third, {{on the basis of the}} above we built a conceptual 3 D model of <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> habitat in the Southeastern Pacific. We reveal the presence of a low suitable habitat along the Chilean and Peruvian coast, figuratively presenting a closed door caused by a gap in the horizontal habitat at ∼ 19 – 22 °S and a shallow oxycline off south-centre Peru. This kind of situation likely occurs on a seasonal basis, in austral summer but also at longer temporal scales. A lack of exchanges at some periods/seasons partially isolate <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> distributed off Peru.

40|$|The seafood {{processing}} industry {{has to deal}} with the considerable intrinsic variability that occurs within a population of harvested fish. Processors need to know the nature of the raw material before the techniques of chilling, freezing, smoking or canning can be correctly applied. The aim of this work was to determine the physicochemical parameters and microbiological quality of Mediterranean horse mackerel (Trachurus mediterraneus) muscle during the year and the consequent advantages or disadvantages in processing the raw material. The seasonal intrinsic variability of the North Aegean Sea Mediterranean horse mackerel (T. mediterraneus) population have been studied from monthly samples taken from the Greek purse-seine fishery over a four-year period (2001 - 2005). The length and weight frequency distributions differed significantly by season, the highest mean lengths and weights attained in spring and the lowest in autumn. Length-weight relationships were determined on a monthly and annual basis and there were found monthly variations on the allometry coefficient. The differences between the coefficient obtained for annual data and the coefficients for each month were not significant in 50 % of the cases. The b values obtained both in this study and some of the previously reported in the Mediterranean Sea and other Greek waters were compared, showing basic similarities and minor spatial variation. The seasonal cycle in Mediterranean horse mackerel condition appears {{to be related to the}} reproductive cycle of the fish. Values of muscle yield ranged between 23. 33 % and 33. 07 % (mean value: 28. 48 ± 2. 49 %), but variations within seasons were not significant. A total of 360 samples were examined (30 samples per month) during two years (November 2001 - November 2003) in order to determine the chemical composition and the microbiological quality of Mediterranean horse mackerel (Trachurus mediterraneus) muscle during the year. Fish were caught in the coastal waters of Chalkidiki peninsula (North Greece). Proximate composition of the muscle during the year resulted in: water 76. 8 ± 1. 39 %, proteins 20. 3 ± 0. 68 %, fat 1. 3 ± 1. 08 % and ash 1. 5 ± 0. 08 %. In March, April and May an increase in fat content of the muscle (2. 5 %, 2. 8 % and 2. 1 % respectively) and a decrease in water content of the muscle (below 75. 9 %) were observed. On the contrary, fat content showed a decrease in September and October (0. 4 % and 0. 6 % respectively), while water content of the muscle increased during these months (78. 2 % and 77. 6 % respectively). The protein content of the muscle remained at high values, while the ash content was almost constant during the year. The mean value of muscle pH was 6. 38 ± 0. 16; extreme values (7) of muscle pH were not observed. Total Viable Bacteria, Shewanella putrefaciens and Pseudomonas spp. were used as microbial indices to evaluate the microbiological quality of the muscle. Mean counts of Total Viable Bacteria, Shewanella putrefaciens and Pseudomonas spp. during the year were: 4. 01 ± 0. 38 log 10 cfu/g, 2. 37 ± 0. 43 log 10 cfu/g and 3. 34 ± 0. 27 log 10 cfu/g respectively. The variations of the values within seasons are minimal and significant homogeneity in the chemical composition and microbiological quality of Mediterranean horse mackerel muscle is observed. This is an important advantage in processing of the raw material. Sensory, physicοchemical and microbiological analyses were carried out on Mediterranean horse mackerel and <b>blue</b> <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> in order to determine quality changes during storage in ice. Sensory results indicated that whole Mediterranean horse mackerel and <b>blue</b> <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> used in this trial had a shelf-life of 10 and 7 days respectively. Fishtester and Fishchecker measurements showed that the quality of <b>blue</b> <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> had deteriorated more rapidly. The pH of Mediterranean horse mackerel muscle was consistently lower than the pH of <b>blue</b> <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> muscle during the storage period. The pH values of both species muscle increased gradually with time and pH value equal to 7 had almost coincided with the end of shelf-life. Bacterial loads in both fish species muscle remained rather low prior to day 10 (< 6 log 10 cfu/g). The longer shelf-life of Mediterranean horse mackerel as determined by sensory evaluation was not reflected in microbiological results suggesting that the difference was due to lower rate of autolysis rather than to reduced microbial activity. The quality changes of Mediterranean horse mackerel muscle kept under vacuum during 20 months of frozen storage at - 18 °C were studied. Analyses included physicochemical and chemical changes, lipid hydrolysis and oxidation damage, and sensory acceptance. Attribute scores (appearance, texture, odor, flavor) were found to be at a level of acceptance during almost 16 months. Water holding capacity decreased significantly over the first eight months of frozen storage while pH values did not lead to good correlation with the storage time. Lipid hydrolysis developed gradually up to 8 months while free fatty acids remained relative constant between 10 and 18 months [...] . ...|$|E

The objectives of this workshop were to review, document and make rec-ommendations on current methods of ageing Trachurus species. This workshop was preceded by otolith exchanges in 2014, which were undertaken using WebGR. A total of 550 fish was sampled from the Atlantic Ocean (Eastern Channel, Celtic Sea, Bay of Biscay, Azores, Portuguese waters and Tenerife) and the Mediterranean Sea (Alboran Sea, South Adriatic Sea and Ligurian Sea). 19 readers from 8 countries (France, Germany, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Netherlands and Norway) participated to this exchange. Among three Trachurus species, all data showed a very low precision with the percentage of agreement between 47 and 56 % and a CV from 29 to 69 %. The precision analysis showed {{the same level of}} precision between otolith sections and whole otoliths from the Ligurian Sea. The workshop achieved quite a lot in terms of ironing out, through discussion and calibration, of some of the major difficulties in ageing otoliths of Trachurus species. The results of the comparison between different ageing techniques on the same set of fish, showed a bias intra-reader and so it is recommended to use only one ageing technique by each reader. Moreover, the precision of reading is the same between slices and whole otoliths and so there is not a best ageing technique for T. trachurus. The progress of reading showed a percentage of agreement close to 65 % for T. trachu-rus and Trachurus picturatus. However, the percentage of agreement for Trachurus mediterraneus remained to 44. 4 % with a CV to 40. In fact, the next exchange must be target Trachurus mediterraneus as a priority.

40|$|The present working {{document}} summarises {{a part of}} the main results obtained from the Spanish (pelagic ecosystem‐) acoustic survey conducted by IEO between 28 th July and 10 th August 2015 in the Portuguese and Spanish shelf waters (20 ‐ 200 m isobaths) off the Gulf of Cadiz onboard the R/V Miguel Oliver. The 21 foreseen acoustic transects were sampled. A total of 19 valid fishing hauls were carried out for echo‐trace ground‐truthing purposes. CUFES sampling (117 stations) was carried during the survey in order to describe the extension of the anchovy spawning area. A census of top predator species was also carried out along the sampled acoustic transects. This {{working document}} only provides abundance and biomass estimates for anchovy and sardine which are presented without age structure. The distribution of all the mid‐sized and small pelagic fish species susceptible of being acoustically assessed is also shown from the mapping of their back‐scattering energies. Sardine was the most frequent species in the fishing hauls, followed by horse mackerel, chub mackerel, anchovy and mackerel. However, the most abundant species in these hauls was anchovy, followed at quite a distance by <b>blue</b> <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel,</b> sardine, horse mackerel and chub mackerel. As usual, the bulk of the anchovy population was concentrated in {{the central part of the}} surveyed area, with the smallest anchovies mainly occurring in the surroundings of the Guadiana and Guadalquivir river mouths and Bay of Cadiz, and larger/older anchovies occurring in the westernmost waters. The total biomass estimated for anchovy, 21. 3 kt (2 506 million fish), was slightly below the historical average, but it still in the range of population levels featuring to a recovered population. The comparison of these estimates with their spring counterparts from the PELAGO survey evidences almost identical values for the Portuguese waters, whereas the ECOCADIZ survey estimated in summer at about 1000 million and 11800 t less of anchovy in the Spanish waters. Such differences might be attributable to a possible overestimation of the acoustic energy attributed to anchovy in the Spanish waters of the Gulf by the PELAGO survey because of the difficulties in the discrimination of anchovy echoes in this area from a dense plankton layer where the species was embedded. Sardine was widely distributed all over the surveyed area but in the easternmost waters closer to the Strait of Gibraltar and showed two main nuclei of density: the coastal waters of the central part of the Gulf, and the inner‐mid shelf waters between Cape San Vicente and Cape Santa Maria. Sardine yielded a total of 23. 5 kt (883 million fish), population levels which have showed some recovery from the lowest historical values recorded in the two previous years but still below the historical average. In contrast to the abovementioned for anchovy, ECOCADIZ survey estimated in summer 4 fold more sardine in Spanish waters than PELAGO survey in spring, with the juvenile fraction being the dominant in both seasons. The progressive incorporation (recruitment) of juveniles coming from successive spawning events may be the reason for such seasonal differences. INTRODUCTIO...|$|E

There has been some confusion between the Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus symmetricus) and the heavily harvested Chilean <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus murphyi). These have been thought at times to be the same species, but are now recognised as separate species.|$|R

50|$|Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> are fished commercially {{as well as}} for sport. They {{are often}} caught on baited hook from piers and boats, and also while salmon trolling. Commercial fishing occurs along the coast. Large {{individuals}} often move inshore and north in the summer.Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> is canned {{in the same manner as}} salmon. Fish are cleaned, gutted and finned, then packed into cans with salt and water.|$|R
40|$|The {{study on}} Hydrography and <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel</b> stock (Trachurus murphyi) in the South Pacific is {{currently}} one year underway. The main achievement consisted of collecting detailed datasets on Chilean, Peruvian and European fisheries activities {{and information on}} the hydrographical / biochemical and environmental conditions present in the South Pacific. The hydrographical and environmental datasets {{are based on the}} analyses of available acoustic information collected on-board survey and fishing vessels and satellite imagery data. <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel</b> habitat models are being developed based on these datasets. These models will be used to produce maps of the potential habitat of <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel,</b> on the basis of which different stock structure hypotheses will be tested. The models developed so far are able to accurately represent the distribution of <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel</b> as observed by fishing and surveying activities, although some additional investigations are needed to improve the statistical fits. Good fits with hydrographical conditions have been found. The models are not yet ready to be used for testing stock structure hypotheses, but this should be the case in the near future. During {{the first year of the}} project, an extensive literature review on <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel</b> has also been conducted, and a synthesis has been written, giving an overview on the species biology, ecology and stock structure. The literature suggests that a meta-population structure can be seen as a potential stock structure hypothesis. The literature review also contributed to identify environmental variables that should be crucial to define the suitable habitat of <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel.</b> Previously published results indicate, among others, temperature and dissolved oxygen ranges in which <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel</b> is able to survive. Finally, a framework to derive reference points for <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel,</b> assuming the single stock structure as used within the SPRFMO assessment, has been developed and made available to the SPRFMO Science Committee for review. Analyses of the assessment results within this framework indicate that the fishing mortality corresponding to maximum sustainable yield might be at around 0. 15 per year with a corresponding spawning stock biomass of around 10 million tonnes. Different harvest control rules have been evaluated and show little risk to overexploitation in the medium and long term, although these result heavily rely on strong incoming year classes. The tools to evaluate sustainable management options for the <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel</b> population, when a stock structure other than a single one is assumed, are currently under development. The design of scenarios to be tested depend on the results of the habitat modelling exercises. Therefore, preliminary results will only become available early 2014...|$|R
50|$|The Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> is {{classified}} within the genus Trachurus, {{commonly known as}} the horse <b>mackerels</b> or <b>jack</b> <b>mackerels.</b> Trachurus is part of the jack family Carangidae, a group of perciform fish in the suborder Percoidei. Recent genetic studies have divided the Carangidae into four subfamilies, with the genus Trachurus falling into the 'Caranginae' (or tribe Carangini), being most closely related to the 'scads' of the genera Decapterus and Selar.|$|R
40|$|Changes in the {{proximate}} composition, lipid classes, and {{fatty acids}} were studied in chub mackerel Scomber japonicus and Japa-nese <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> Trachurus japonicus muscles cooked using a frying pan, oven, and microwave oven. The moisture content was {{high in the}} raw samples (chub mackerel 65. 5 %, Japanese <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> 60. 5 %) and decreased with cooking, especially in the frying pan method (chub mackerel 49. 2 %, Japanese <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> 49. 8 %). In contrast, the protein, lipid and ash contents in-creased significantly with cooking in chub mackerel muscle (P< 0. 05). However, the lipid content of Japanese <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> muscle showed {{no significant difference between}} the samples using the three cooking methods and the raw sample. The dripped lipid contents from the cooked muscles showed the highest levels in the frying pan samples and the lowest levels in the microwave oven samples.
