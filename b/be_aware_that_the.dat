Stein's five-man {{defensive}} set-up meant that his midfielders were outnumbered by the Welsh, and consequently Strachan had failed to make an impact on the game up to then. Despite this, Strachan was prepared to argue with Stein that he should remain on, until Alex Ferguson cautioned him to <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> manager was clearly not well, and should not cause too much stress with a confrontation.|$|E

Awareness of how a mnemonic facilitates one's memory is an example of metamemory. Wimmer and Tornquist conducted an experiment in which participants were asked to recall a set of items. Participants were made aware of the usefulness of a mnemonic device (categorical grouping) either before or after recall. Participants who were made aware of the usefulness of the mnemonic before recall (displaying metamemory for the mnemonic's usefulness) {{were significantly more likely to}} use the mnemonic than those who were not made aware of the mnemonic before recall.|$|E

He said that current income tax laws assume that people are guilty and they must then prove they are innocent, and he believes this aspect of tax law is unfair. However, {{he said that he}} prefers to work for improved tax laws by getting elected to Congress and trying to change the laws themselves rather than simply not paying the tax.|$|E

500|$|The 1883 Pony Track to {{the summit}} (also known as the Ben Path, the Mountain Path or the Tourist Route) remains the {{simplest}} and most popular route of ascent. It begins at Achintee {{on the east side}} of Glen Nevis about [...] from Fort William town centre, at around 20 metres above sea level. Bridges from the Visitor Centre and the youth hostel now allow access from the west side of Glen Nevis. The path climbs steeply to the saddle by Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe (colloquially known as the 'Halfway Lake') at 570m, then ascends the remaining 700 metres up the stony west flank of Ben Nevis in a series of zig-zags. The path is regularly maintained but running water, uneven rocks and loose scree make it hazardous and slippery in places. Thanks to the zig-zags, the path is not unusually steep apart from in the initial stages, but inexperienced walkers should <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> descent is relatively arduous and wearing on the knees.|$|E

500|$|Even {{with his}} First Nations allies, Brock was outnumbered {{approximately}} two to one. He {{decided to use}} tricks to intimidate Hull. He dressed his militia contingent in uniforms discarded by his regulars, making it appear (at a distance) as if his force consisted entirely of British regular infantry. Brock laid siege to Fort Detroit, from established artillery positions across the river in Sandwich. Through a carefully crafted series of marches, he gave the appearance of having much more numerous forces. He had Tecumseh's forces cross {{in front of the}} fort several times (doubling back under cover), intimidating Hull with the show of a large, raucous, barely controlled group of First Nations warriors. Finally, he sent Hull a letter demanding his surrender, in which he stated, in part, [...] "It is far from my inclination to join in a war of extermination, but you must <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> numerous body of Indians who have attached themselves to my troops will be beyond my control the moment the contest commences." [...] Brock hammered the fort with cannon fire. On 16 August, the day after receiving Brock's letter, Hull surrendered. Hull, elderly and without recent military experience, was terrified that the civilian population of the fort, including his own daughter and grandson, would face torture {{at the hands of the}} First Nations.|$|E

This includes a dramatic version of the story of Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar and a version of the first part of the story of Robin Hood and the Potter.

2500|$|When {{discussing}} {{the qualities of}} Byron's poetry in comparison with how Verdi treated it musically, Julian Budden points to one obvious problem: the opera [...] "hardly makes for music-drama [...] it is a narrative. [...] Not being conceived of in dramatic terms it offers no opportunity for the generation of musical power through conflict and clash of personalities." [...] He compares it unfavourably with [...] "the steady crescendo of dramatic interest" [...] in Ernani, or the [...] "cut and thrust of character dialectic that informs I due Foscari and [...] "without the sense of grand theatre that transfigures the great moments in Giovanna d'Arco and Attila. David Kimball (in Holden) [...] also describes it in comparable terms, emphasizing that [...] "after the weightiness of the three previous three operas [...] seems a light, sketchy piece." [...] But he does note that Verdi was [...] "designing arias more imaginatively". Of interest is the caution given by Roger Parker for us to <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dramatic structure of the opera was finalized in 1846, before Macbeth, and therefore {{this might be a}} reason for regarding the opera as old-fashioned.|$|E
2500|$|The Saharanpur Botanical Gardens, {{known as}} the Company Garden and once the {{preserve}} of the British East India Company, {{is one of the}} oldest existing gardens in India, dating to before 1750. Then named Farahat-Bakhsh, it was originally a pleasure ground set out by a local chief, Intazam ud-ullah. In 1817, it was acquired by the British East India Company and placed under the authority of the District Surgeon. Joseph Dalton Hooker says of this Botanical Garden that [...] "Amongst its greatest triumphs may be considered the introduction of the tea-plant from China, a fact I allude to, as many of my English readers may not <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> establishment of the tea-trade in the Himalaya and Assam is almost entirely the work of the superintendents of the gardens of Calcutta and Seharunpore. In 1887, when the Botanical Survey of India was set up to reform the country's botanical sciences, Saharanpur became the centre for the survey of the northern Indian flora. The Garden is seen historically as being second only to the Calcutta Gardens for its contribution to science and economy in India. Under private auspices today, it is full of greenery and has many different kinds of plants and flowers.|$|E
