40|$|Objective: The {{advantages}} of the ultrasonic <b>bone</b> <b>curette</b> which has been recently started {{to be used in}} neurosurgical operations is emphasized. Methods: Ultrasonic <b>bone</b> <b>curette</b> was used in 7 cases which has been operated in our clinic between 2006 - 2007. These cases were basilar artery tip aneurysm, type 1 diastematomyelia, pontocerebellar angle tumor, orbital tumor, lombar spinal stenosis, tuberculum sella meningioma, giant internal carotid artery aneurysm of the cavernous sinus respectively. Results: The posterior clinoid process in basilar artery aneurysm, the bone spicule in diastematomyelia, the posterior wall of acustic canal in pontocerebellar angle tumor,the roof of optic canal in orbital tumor, the anterior clinoid process in giant internal carotid artery aneurysm were removed with ultrasonic <b>bone</b> <b>curette.</b> In tuberculum sella meningioma the calcificated tumor was removed Simpson grade III. Conclusion: Compared to high speed drill the ultrasonic <b>bone</b> <b>curette</b> can be used safely and succesfully in the areas close to the dura matter, neural and vascular structures...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Accessing intradural lesions via an {{extended}} endoscopic endonasal approach requires {{a relatively large}} bony removal over the skull base. OBJECTIVE: We describe the Sonopet ultrasonic <b>bone</b> <b>curette</b> with a new dedicated endonasal hand-piece. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used this ancillary device in 27 nonconsecutive endonasal procedures for different skull base lesions (18 standard pituitary operations and 9 extended approaches for either meningiomas or craniopharyngiomas). RESULTS: The ultrasonic <b>bone</b> <b>curette</b> with endonasal hand-piece was {{easy to use and}} effective during the removal of the bone covering or when close to the carotid and optic prominences, as well as in preserving the integrity of the superior intercavernous sinus. In only 1 case was small tearing of the dura mater observed during the bony removal. No cases of injury to the major neurovascular structures occurred. CONCLUSION: The Sonopet ultrasonic <b>bone</b> <b>curette</b> is a useful tool during endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Orbitofrontal fibrous {{dysplasia}} {{often involves}} the bony orbit and optic canal. Although fibrous dysplasia reportedly produces compression of the optic nerve leading to visual disturbances, optic nerve decompression in patients without clinical signs of optic neuropathy remains controversial. We describe the recent development of surgical techniques and equipment for optic nerve decompression in orbitofrontal fibrous dysplasia. Methods: Optic nerve decompression was performed prophylactically for five patients and therapeutically for one patient using the transcranial extradural route. A high-speed drill and continuous suction-irrigation {{system has been}} used in five patients since 1998, and an ultrasonic <b>bone</b> <b>curette</b> in two patients since 2004. Results: The continuous suction-irrigation system was particularly effective for decreasing heat transfer and thus preventing thermal injury to the optic nerve from the high-speed drill. The ultrasonic <b>bone</b> <b>curette</b> was also effective, allowing bone removal with minimal pressure from the tip of the handpiece and without catching cotton pledgets or damaging surrounding tissues. Orbital dystopias and craniofacial deformities induced by fibrous dysplasia were also successfully corrected. Postoperatively, disturbance in visual function was present in only two patients. Mean follow-up period was 4. 9 years. Conclusions: This equipment may {{contribute to the development of}} new modalities for optic nerve decompression in orbitofrontal fibrous dysplasia...|$|E
40|$|Endoscopic Endonasal Trans-sphenoid Surgery (EETS) {{aided by}} avant-garde neuro-navigation techniques, {{ultrasonic}} aspirators and <b>bone</b> <b>curettes</b> has come of age. Endoscopic surgery supersedes conventional microscopic approach due to better visualization, avoidance of craniotomy, brain retraction and undue neurovascular manipulation with less morbidity, blood loss and improved safety. Anaesthetic techniques must {{be tailored to}} cater for such advances in surgery...|$|R
40|$|The {{indications}} for tympanoplasty {{are mainly}} chronic ear pathologies, such as cholesteatoma, atelectasis and chronic tympanosclerotic otitis. Usually, {{modification of the}} mastoid and temporal tissues in general mostly involves bone work, which means bone removal by burs or appropriate <b>bone</b> <b>curettes.</b> It {{is for this reason}} that, in both the pre- and postoperative periods, the computed tomography (CT) scan is the primary radiological tool for studying the middle-ear, and temporal bone structures and pathologies. The aim of this review is to illustrate the most up-to-date postoperative results for tympanoplasty, including the emerging endoscopic techniques. The present work focuses on the five types of tympanoplasty that are likely to be encountered by the radiologist: radical surgery; open tympanoplasty; closed tympanoplasty; closed endoscopic tympanoplasty; and open endoscopic tympanoplasty. Understanding and interpreting temporal bone images in relation to the different types of surgery are important, especially at the postoperative stage, because of the high risk of recurrence of middle-ear pathologies, and a good working knowledge of surgical changes is fundamental for distinguishing iatrogenic bone demolition from complications and new pathological foci...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the surgical management of a post-traumatic calcified thoracic disc herniation treated using ultrasonic <b>bone</b> <b>curette</b> SONO-PET®. The case described concerns {{a young man}} with a symptomatic calcified thoracic disc herniation, who underwent posterolateral approach and transversoarthropediculectomy. Patient underwent posterolateral approach with excellent postoperative results. Neurophysiological monitoring somato-sensory evoked potential (SSEP) and muscle motor evoked potentials (MMEP), inclination of 30 ° toward the unaffected side of the operating table, the use of Ultrasonic Bone-Curette SONO-PET® and proper reconstruction of the three floors of the back muscles allows the removal of the disc herniation safer and risk's free, and less invasive for the patient...|$|E
40|$|Aim. We discuss {{technical}} points, the safety, {{and efficacy}} of ultrasonic bone shaver in various spinal surgeries within our own series. Methods. Between June 2010 and January 2014, 307 patients with various spinal diseases were operated on {{with the use of}} an ultrasonic <b>bone</b> <b>curette</b> with microhook shaver (UBShaver). Patients' data were recorded and analyzed retrospectively. The technique {{for the use of the}} device is described for each spine surgery procedure. Results. Among the 307 patients, 33 (10. 7 %) cases had cervical disorder, 17 (5. 5 %) thoracic disorder, 3 (0. 9 %) foramen magnum disorder, and 254 (82. 7 %) lumbar disorders. Various surgical techniques were performed either assisted or alone by UBShaver. The duration of the operations and the need for blood replacement were relatively low. The one-year follow-up with Neck Disability Index (NDI) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were improved. We had 5 cases of dural tears (1. 6 %) in patients with lumbar spinal disease. No neurological deficit was found in any patients. Conclusion. We recommend this device as an assistant tool in various spine surgeries and as a primary tool in foraminotomies. It is a safe device in spine surgery with very low complication rate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract】Guide wire {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the fixation of femoral neck fracture with dynamic hip screw (DHS). Breakage of a guide wire during operation is a very rare condition. We met such a dilemma in DHS fixation of a 54 -year-old male patient who sustained Garden type IV frac-ture of the right femoral neck. The distal end of the guide wire broke and was entrapped in the fractured femoral neck. We tried to get the broken part out by a cannulated drill. Reaming was started with the cannulated drill slowly rotat-ing around the guide K-wire until the reamer fully contained the target under fluoroscope. A <b>bone</b> <b>curette</b> was used to get the broken wire out but failed, so we had to use the cannuated drill to dredge this bone tunnel. Finally the bro-ken wire end was taken out, mixed with blood and bone fragments. Through the existing drilling channel, DHS fixa-tion was easily finished. The patient had an uneventful re-covery without avascular necrosis of femoral head or non-union of the fracture at one year’s follow-up. A few methods can be adopted to deal with the broken guide wire. The way used in our case is less invasive but technically challenging. When the guide wire is properly positioned, this method is very practical and useful. Key words: Femoral neck fractures; Bones wires; Complication...|$|E
40|$|Endoscopic endonasal trans-sphenoid surgery (EETS) is {{increasingly}} used for pituitary lesions. Pre-operative CT and MRI scans and peroperative endoscopic visualization can provide useful anatomical information. EETS is indicated in sellar, suprasellar, intraventricular, retro-infundibular, and invasive tumors. Recurrent and residual lesions, pituitary apoplexy and {{empty sella syndrome}} can be managed by EETS. Modern neuronavigation techniques, ultrasonic aspirators, ultrasonic <b>bone</b> <b>curette</b> can add to the safety. The binostril approach provides a wider working area. High definition camera is much superior to three-chip camera. Most of the recent reports favor EETS in terms of safety, {{quality of life and}} tumor resection, hospital stay, better endocrinological, and visual outcome as compared to the microscopic technique. Nasal symptoms, blood loss, operating time are less in EETS. Various naso-septal flaps and other techniques of CSF leak repair could help reduce complications. Complications can be further reduced after achieving the learning curve, good understanding of limitations with proper patient selection. Use of neuronavigation, proper post-operative care of endocrine function, establishing pituitary center of excellence and more focused residency and endoscopic fellowship training could improve results. The faster and safe transition from microscopic to EETS can be done by the team concept of neurosurgeon/otolaryngologist, attending hands on cadaveric dissection, practice on models, and observation of live surgeries. Conversion to a microscopic or endoscopic-assisted approach may be required in selected patients. Multi-modality treatment could be required in giant and invasive tumors. EETS appears to be a better surgical option in most pituitary adenoma...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{separation}} of the pterygomaxillary region at the posterior nasal spine level after Le Fort I osteotomy in Class III patients. Patients and Methods: The study group consisted of 37 Japanese patients with mandibular prognathism and asymmetry, with maxillary retrognathism or asymmetry. A total of 74 sides were examined. Le Fort I osteotomy was performed without a pterygoid osteotome, with an ultrasonic curette used to remove interference at the pterygomaxillary region. Postoperative computed tomography (CT) was analyzed for all patients. The separation of the pterygomaxillary region and the location of the descending palatine artery were assessed. Results: Although acceptable separation between the maxilla and pterygoid plates was achieved in all patients, an exact separation of the pterygomaxillary junction at the posterior nasal spine level was found in only 18 of 74 sides (24 %). In 29 of 74 sides (39. 2 %), the separation occurred anterior to the descending palatine artery. In 29 of 74 sides (39. 2 %), complete separation between the maxilla and lateral and/or medial pterygoid plate was not achieved, but lower level separation of the maxilla and pterygoid plate was always complete. The maxillary segments could be moved to the postoperative ideal position in all cases. Conclusion: Le Fort I osteotomy without an osteotome does not always induce an exact separation at the pterygomaxillary junction at the posterior nasal spine level, but the ultrasonic <b>bone</b> <b>curette</b> can remove the interference between maxillary segment and pterygoid plates more safely. © 2009 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons...|$|E
