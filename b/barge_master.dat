60|$|I forgot when I {{was talking}} {{of work to}} say that Uncle Henry got work the very second day that we were here. He works down at the docks where the ships are. I think he supervises the {{incoming}} and outgoing of the American navy. It is called being a stevedore, and no doubt his being an Admiral helped him to get it. He hopes to get a certificate presently to be a <b>Barge</b> <b>Master,</b> which will put him {{in charge of the}} canals. But there is a very difficult examination to go through and Uncle Henry is working for it at night out of a book. He has to take up Vulgar Fractions which, of course, none of our High Seas Command were asked to learn. But Uncle Henry is stooping to them.|$|E
60|$|Of {{course as}} Uncle has not any work or any position, {{we are getting}} poorer and poorer. Cousin Willie has {{been sent to the}} {{fortress}} at Sing-Sing and Cousin Ferdinand of Bulgaria refuses to know us any more, though, from what we hear, he is getting on wonderfully well in the clothing business and is very soon to open a big new store of which he is to be the general manager. Cousin Karl is now the Third Assistant Head-Waiter at the King George Hotel, and in the sphere in which he moves it is impossible for him to acknowledge any relationship with us. I don't know what we should do but that Uncle Henry manages to give us enough of his wages to pay for our board and lodging. Uncle Henry has passed his Naval Examination and is now appointed to a quite high command. It is called a <b>Barge</b> <b>Master.</b> They refused to accept his certificate of a German Admiral, so he had to study very hard, but at last he got his qualification and is now in charge of long voyages on the canals.|$|E
50|$|Masters Energy City {{contains}} a fabrication yard, established in 20. It fabricates and constructs equipment {{for use in}} {{the oil and gas industry}} and other sectors. The fabrication yard has constructed two different 1,000 MT capacity barges and is presently constructing additional three <b>barges.</b> <b>Masters</b> Energy sells petroleum products at over 60 retail outlets in Nigeria at government’s approved pump price. Its depot in Port Harcourt also sells products at government’s approved depot price.|$|R
60|$|At the {{appointed}} hour, the <b>barge</b> of <b>Master</b> George Heriot arrived, handsomely manned and appointed, having a tilt, {{with his own}} cipher, and {{the arms of his}} company, painted thereupon.|$|R
5000|$|... 10 cent in copper-nickel, 11g, 28,5mm dia., round, 1972-1981 (10M). Obverse design: Grand <b>Master's</b> <b>barge.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the outset}} of World War II he joined the 2nd AIF, serving in the commandos, and was a <b>barge</b> <b>master</b> at the landing on Leyte in October 1944.|$|E
5000|$|... 1887 - {{race was}} won by William Giles East {{who went on}} to win the Sculling Championship of England in 1891, became a Queen's Watermen in 1898, and <b>Barge</b> <b>Master</b> to the King in 1906.|$|E
50|$|After {{retiring}} from competitive sculling Ernest Barry turned to coaching. He was appointed the Royal <b>Barge</b> <b>Master</b> to King George VI, {{and later to}} Queen Elizabeth II until {{he retired from the}} position in 1952 because of ill health.|$|E
60|$|They kept in {{the wake}} of the {{handsome}} <b>barge</b> which <b>Master</b> Headley shared with his friend and brother alderman, Master Hope the draper, whose young wife, in a beautiful black velvet hood and shining blue satin kirtle, was evidently petting Dennet to her heart's content, though the little damsel never lost an opportunity of nodding to her friends in the plainer barge in the rear.|$|R
50|$|The main {{products}} {{carried on the}} canal were chalk, coal and timber. Coal from Newcastle or South Wales was transferred from coastal ships into barges at Arundel. Chalk was barged up the River Arun from pits leased and operated by the Earl at Houghton and Amberley. Timber {{and all kinds of}} timber products, including charcoal and oak bark for tanning were barged out from the Peworth area, although there are few records of what passed through Haslingbourne. A lime kiln was operated at Haslingbourne wharf, and some lime barged down the canal. Most of the Petworth trade however went to Coultershaw wharf on the Rother navigation, which was further away from the town but was on the well maintained turnpike road to Chichester. There was no extra toll for using the Petworth canal but this also saved the <b>barge</b> <b>masters</b> having to travel through two locks. From east of Petworth it was often cheaper to cart goods to and from the River Arun, which was free of tolls below Pallingham, avoiding the Rother Navigation tolls payable on passing through Stopham Lock.|$|R
5000|$|In late November 2008 the Atlantic Towing Ltd. {{dredging}} <b>barge</b> Shovel <b>Master</b> {{was being}} towed by the company's tugboat Atlantic Larch from Saint John to Halifax for a refit when it foundered in heavy seas 20 nmi km west of Yarmouth, NS. The barge crew of 3 was rescued by a CH-149 Cormorant {{search and rescue}} helicopter before the barge capsized. Several ATL tugboats and commercial divers responded and a tow line was secured to the capsized, yet floating, barge by the tugboat Atlantic Oak. The barge was towed 45 nmi km south of Yarmouth however it sank in 150 m, carrying 70000 L of diesel fuel, as well as 1000 L of hydraulic fluid and 5000 L of waste oil.|$|R

Dally Messenger III is the great-great-grandson of Thames boat-builder James Arthur Messenger, who was a Queen's Waterman, <b>barge</b> <b>master</b> to Queen Victoria, and sculling {{champion of the world}} from 1854 to 1857.|$|E
50|$|If legend {{is to be}} believed, {{the first}} {{official}} Bristol Channel pilot was <b>barge</b> <b>master</b> George James Ray, appointed by the Corporation of Bristol in May 1497 to pilot John Cabot's Matthew from Bristol harbour to the open sea beyond the Bristol channel. In 1837 Pilot George Ray guided Brunel's SS Great Western, and in 1844 William Ray piloted the larger SS Great Britain on her maiden voyage.|$|E
5000|$|The natural {{dangers of}} the Bristol Channel brought about over many years the {{development}} of the specialist Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter. According to records from Pill, Somerset now housed in the Bristol Museum, the first official Bristol Channel pilot was <b>barge</b> <b>master</b> George James Ray, appointed by the Corporation of Bristol in May 1497 to pilot John Cabot's [...] from Bristol harbour to the open sea beyond. In 1837 Pilot George Ray guided Brunel's , and in 1844 William Ray piloted the larger [...] on her maiden voyage.|$|E
5000|$|Atlantic Oak is a Z-drive class, {{with two}} Aquamaster US 225, Twin screw tug built to a design first {{used for the}} tug Atlantic Spruce. She has two Caterpiller 3516 HD engines with {{a top speed of}} 13 Knots. She carries {{on-board}} firefighting equipment and has an 80 tonne deck capacity. She is 28.79 m long, 11.14 m wide and draws 5.24 5.24 m.== Notable events== In 2008 the dredging <b>barge</b> Shovel <b>Master</b> capsized after experiencing rough seas while being towed by Atlantic Larch from Saint John to Halifax for a refit. The crew were rescued by a CH-149 Cormorant search and rescue helicopter shortly before the barge capsized near [...] Yarmouth. Atlantic Oak towed the capsized, but still floating barge,for only 150m before it sank, spilling thousands of gallons of diesel fuel, hydraulic fluid and waste oil.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} people thought that the master of Vosburg had not done {{everything}} he could have to rescue the barge. The surviving crew of the Wheeler “severely condemned” {{the actions of the}} captain of the Vosburg, saying that Vosburg had recently taken on a fresh supply of coal at Coos Bay and that on board Wheeler there was another towing cable of better quality than the one which had broken. [...] Later, “Mike” Olderman, who along with J.W. Cole, {{had been one of the}} first two crewmen washed off Wheeler into the surf, said they after the towing cable had broken, the crew of Wheeler had tried to attract the attention of Vosburg by building a large fire on the deck, using oil to increase its size. [...] According to Olderman, the barge was not in danger until many hours later when the wind strength increased to that of a hurricane. [...] Capt. W.H. Roberts, assistant inspector of the U.S. life-saving district of Oregon and Washington, who had made the inquiry into the circumstances of the wreck, wrote in his official report: The abandonment of the <b>barge</b> by the <b>master</b> of the tug Vosburg is to be condemned. Had the tug been short of coal, which I believe was the reason given for running to the Columbia River, a plentiful supply could have been obtained by running into Coos Bay, some 25 or 30 miles distant. He could have then searched for and picked up the barge, which would probably would have prevented the loss of property as well as the loss of life.|$|R
5000|$|In 1940, she was machine gunned {{twice in}} the River Medina and bombed in a {{daylight}} raid at Phoenix Wharf by the Luftwaffe. In the same year another Thames sailing barge, Britisher, was destroyed by depth charges only 300 yards away. [...] In 1942 she was very nearly torpedoed off Harwich by a German motor torpedo boat and {{in the following year}} she was attacked by a Focke-Wulf that shot 1,000 holes through her mainsail. [...] However, none her crew were injured and by this point her wheel house had been reinforced with steel to withstand aircraft mounted machine guns. Jim Uglow was awarded an MBE for his work becoming the only <b>Barge</b> <b>Master</b> to be honoured with such an achievement in this line of work.|$|E
5000|$|Pilots in the Bristol Channel {{had their}} own cutters, which were manned by a Westernmen and a boy. The cutters raced westwards to meet the {{incoming}} ships in the Western Approaches of the Irish Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Pilots either owned their own or shared cutters, which were permanently manned by a pilot, western man and a boy, {{one of whom was}} often an apprentice pilot [...] Once a pilot had negotiated a price for pilotage with the master of an inbound vessel, the pilot would board the vessel and the pilot cutter, would follow in the capable hands of the western man and the boy, to be reunited at Hungroad or Kingroad.Records from Pill suggest that the first official Bristol Channel pilot was <b>barge</b> <b>master</b> George James Ray, appointed by the Corporation of Bristol in May 1497 to pilot John Cabot's [...] from Bristol harbour to the open sea beyond.
