5|$|Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, {{and control}} of {{criminal}} activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the <b>behavioural</b> <b>sciences.</b> The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; {{and how they are}} enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a typology of deviance, which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance.|$|E
5|$|Sir William Dargie {{painted a}} {{portrait}} of Fairley in 1943, {{which is in the}} possession the Fairley family. A later 1960 portrait by Dargie, together with a 1945 one by Nora Heysen, is in the Australian War Memorial. Neither is on display, although the latter can be viewed online. A 1954 Dargie portrait of Queen Elizabeth II painted while Dargie was staying at Fairley's home at 81 Duke Street, Grosvenor Square, in London, and subsequently given to Fairley, was sold at auction to the National Museum of Australia in 2009 for $120,000. Fairley's papers are in the Basser Library at the Australian Academy of Science. He is commemorated by the Neil Hamilton Fairley Overseas Clinical Fellowship, which provides full-time training in Australia and overseas in areas of clinical research including the social and <b>behavioural</b> <b>sciences.</b>|$|E
5|$|Charles Sherrington {{published}} his influential 1906 work The Integrative Action of the Nervous System examining {{the function of}} reflexes, evolutionary development {{of the nervous system}}, functional specialisation of the brain, and layout and cellular function of the central nervous system. John Farquhar Fulton, founded the Journal of Neurophysiology and published the first comprehensive textbook on the physiology of the nervous system during 1938. Neuroscience during the twentieth century began to be recognized as a distinct unified academic discipline, with David Rioch, Francis O. Schmitt, and Stephen Kuffler playing critical roles in establishing the field. Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, starting in the 1950s. During the same period, Schmitt established the Neuroscience Research Program, an inter-university and international organisation, bringing together biology, medicine, psychological and <b>behavioural</b> <b>sciences.</b> The word neuroscience itself arises from this program.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2015, Flinders University senior {{management}} began quietly canvassing its staff about {{a plan to}} host the renamed Lomborg Consensus Centre at the University, likely in the Faculty of Social and <b>Behavioural</b> <b>Sciences.</b> A week later the story was broken on Twitter by the NTEU (National Tertiary Education Union) and Scott Ludlam. The story appeared {{the next day in}} The Australian, but described as [...] "academic conversations" [...] with no mention of Bjorn Lomborg’s involvement and portrayed as a grassroots desire for the Centre by the University. The following week, a story appeared in the Guardian quoting two Flinders University academics and an internal document demonstrating staff’s withering rejection of the idea. Flinders staff and students vowed to fight against the establishment of any Centre or any partnership with Lomborg, citing his lack of scientific credibility, his lack of academic legitimacy and the political nature of the process of establishing the Centre with the Abbott federal government. The Australian Youth Climate Coalition and 350.org launched a national campaign to support staff and students in their rejection of Lomborg.|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the {{structured}} use of <b>behavioural</b> <b>science</b> in helping to frame employment research. This structured framing intended to help stimulate more interdisciplinary interaction between sub-disciplines that study employment and <b>behavioural</b> <b>science,</b> setting out new empirical and theoretical applications {{to the study of}} employment decision-making. Firstly, the application of specific <b>behavioural</b> <b>science</b> concepts to employment scenarios, structured around the core facets of <b>behavioural</b> <b>science,</b> introducing the types of bias studied in <b>behavioural</b> <b>science</b> in turn. These core facets are cognitive and social biases, risk preferences and biases, time preferences and biases. These were combined with illustrative examples of how these biases might affect employment decision-making. The employment cycle is then used to demonstrate how the concepts in <b>behavioural</b> <b>science</b> may play out across a range of employment scenarios, unearthing potential theoretical and empirical applications. 	A <b>behavioural</b> <b>science</b> framing was then used to investigate factors related to the addition or omission of low rated journal publications in the assessment of academic resumes. The results of these investigations showed that low rated journal publications are still of some value, albeit journal ratings play a crucial role. Importantly, the extent to which additional low rated journal publications are valued could depend on unconscious social biases that are based on prior expectations, potentially dictated by organizational and ideological learning over time. The empirical work presented data collected from 1, 011 psychology and management faculty based at U. K. and U. S. A. universities. The data was collected using an online randomized control trial survey experiment designed to test the assessment of publication records on academic resumes. Only faculty at levels likely to be involved in academic appointment panels and reviewing academic resumes were contacted to take part...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Health {{partnerships}} {{often use}} health professional training to change {{practice with the}} aim of improving quality of care. Interventions to change practice can learn from <b>behavioural</b> <b>science</b> and focus not only on improving the competence and capability of health professionals but also their opportunity and motivation to make changes in practice. We describe a project that used behavioural scientist volunteers to enable health partnerships to understand and use the theories, techniques and assessments of <b>behavioural</b> <b>science.</b> Case Studies This paper outlines how The Change Exchange, a collective of volunteer behavioural scientists, worked with health partnerships to strengthen their projects by translating <b>behavioural</b> <b>science</b> in situ. We describe three case studies in which behavioural scientists, embedded in health partnerships in Uganda, Sierra Leone and Mozambique, explored the behaviour change techniques used by educators, supported knowledge and skill development in behaviour change, monitored the impact of projects on psychological determinants of behaviour and made recommendations for future project developments. Discussion Challenges in the work included having time and space for <b>behavioural</b> <b>science</b> in already very busy health partnership schedules and the difficulties in using certain methods in other cultures. Future work could explore other modes of translation and further develop methods to make them more culturally applicable. Conclusion Behavioural scientists could translate <b>behavioural</b> <b>science</b> which was understood and used by the health partnerships to strengthen their project work...|$|R
