30|$|A Paired t-test {{was used}} to analyze {{differences}} in the VBD calculated from FFDM versus DBT. The correlation coefficient (R value) and its 95  % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for variables including the age and calculated VBD.

5|$|A {{cluster is}} a group of loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so that in some respects they can <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster {{do not have to be}} symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network. Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. The vast majority of the TOP500 supercomputers are clusters.|$|E
5|$|A {{nest box}} can also <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> an animal {{surveillance}} device. Surveilling animals {{can lead to}} the discovery of new scientific and industrial fields. For example, biologists and engineers can work on barn owl surveillance techniques and devices, while social scientists document the practices that cause humans to observe an animal. While the diet of the barn owl has been studied, other areas like breeding success are not well known. Nest boxes provide direct physical access to the breeding location.|$|E
5|$|According to an {{alternative}} theory, {{popular in the}} earlier 20th century and still represented today, the medieval cultures {{in the area of}} modern Poland are not a result of massive immigration, but emerged from a cultural transition of earlier indigenous populations, who then would need to <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> early Slavs. This view has mostly been discarded, primarily due to a period of archaeological discontinuity, during which settlements were absent or rare, and because of cultural incompatibility of the late ancient and early medieval sites.|$|E
