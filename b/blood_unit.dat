40|$|AbstractWorldwide > 10 million {{adults and}} 250 000 cord <b>blood</b> <b>units</b> are {{available}} for unrelated HCT. HLA matching and, {{in the case of}} cord <b>blood</b> <b>units,</b> cell dose are critical determinants for selecting among these donors. Once a list of suitable adult donors or cord <b>blood</b> <b>units</b> is established, the transplantation physician must choose the optimal donor. We review factors that go into making that decision. We conclude that for adults the optimal donor is a male who is younger and has a larger body weight. When selecting among female adults, the optimal donor is also younger with a larger body weight and has never been pregnant. Additional factors, which can be considered and are relevant particularly for cord <b>blood</b> <b>units,</b> include family and medical histories, risk-exposure history, collection site characteristics, and geographic location...|$|R

There {{are many ways to}} process a cord <b>blood</b> <b>unit,</b> and there are differing {{opinions}} on what the best way is. Some processing methods separate out the red blood cells and remove them, while others keep the red blood cells.

After the unit is slowly cooled to −90 °C, it can then be added to a liquid nitrogen tank which will keep the cord <b>blood</b> <b>unit</b> frozen at −196 °C. The slow freezing process is important to keep the cells alive during the freezing process.

5000|$|While David {{was still}} {{serving in the}} Air Force, Prof. Aharon Katzir from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, asked David to rebuild the Institute's {{electron}} microscope which had been damaged while researchers tried to activate it. For a few months, David {{was working as a}} military doctor during the day and at the Weizmann Institute of Science at night. In 1955, upon his completion of military service, he began working in the Department of Polymers of the Weizmann Institute. In addition to restoring the function of the electron microscope, he developed and prepared the microtome and other devices necessary for the operation of the electron microscope. Later he founded the Electron Microscopy Laboratory at the Weizmann Institute. His pearly research in the Institute's Electron Microscopy Laboratory involved the membrane structure of erythrocytes, their adherence and thrombocytes. In 1957, while working at the Weizmann Institute David Danon founded with Dr. Kalman the Department of Physiology and Anatomy of Animals, at the Faculty of Agriculture in Rehovot where he taught until 1962. His research during this period continued to focus on erythrocytes and thrombocytes, as well as the interaction between these cells and the influenza virus. In 1964 he was appointed head of the Section for Biological Ultrastructure at the Weizmann Institute. In 1967 he was assigned the title of [...] "professor of biology." [...] Prof. Danon was the founder and first President of the Israeli Society for Electron Microscopy and President of the Israeli Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion. At this time he developed and built Fragiligraph, - a device that enables automatic registration of osmotic fragility curve of erythrocytes, later produced by [...] "Elron".. In later years, Prof. Danon became interested in the process of aging of erythrocytes, and joined the Israeli Association of Gerontology. In 1975 he was elected president of the International Association of Gerontology, and was the first and only Israeli scientist to date to serve in this position (1975-1978). Between the years 1978 to 1987, Prof. Danon served as the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Health. In 1979, he was appointed director of the Center for Research on Aging at the Weizmann Institute, a position he held until his retirement from the Institute in 1987. During a Sabbatical in geriatric medicine at Montefiore Hospital in New York in 1984-1985, he devoted major efforts to alleviating the suffering of patients with pressure ulcers. Between the years 1998 to 1991 he served as scientific advisor to the Israeli Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. Upon his retirement from Weizmann Institute, Prof. Danon was the director of the Waldenberg Gerontology Research Center in New Orleans, Louisiana from 1987 to 1992. At that time while continuing his research on the healing of pressure ulcers, he discovered the critical role of macrophages (a special type of white blood cell) in wound healing. He discovered that the injection of macrophages from young mice, accelerated the healing of wounds in old mice. From 1993 onwards Prof. Danon devoted himself entirely {{to the development of a}} unique, remarkably simple, yet new method for the treatment of severe wounds, based on the injection of [...] "activated" [...] macrophages. [...] In this method, Macrophages were prepared from blood units of standard donated blood, using white blood cells that are typically considered undesirable in routine blood transfusions. Macrophages were prepared from a <b>blood</b> <b>unit</b> in a closed sterile system that consisted of a number of interconnected plastic bags. According to the method developed by Prof. Danon, macrophages activation is done by the [...] "hypo-osmotic shock" [...] without any of the toxic materials usually used to activate cells. This work was carried out in the laboratories of Magen David Adom (the Israeli blood bank), and after many years of work the project was crowned with success. As of 1998, the Israeli Ministry of Health has approved the use of activated macrophage injections for the treatment of serious pressure ulcers and other difficult wounds that are not responsive to standard treatments. The method has been so effective, that it is included as covered within Israel's government health coverage plan.|$|E
30|$|After an earthquake, a {{sufficient}} {{amount of blood}} supplies needs to be available in very short {{time in order to}} treat the injured survivors. A lesson from the 2003 Bam concerned the disaster planning and emergency preparedness of the blood supplies for blood transfusions (Abolghasemi et al. 2008). The Bam disaster caused a large flow of blood donors from around Iran, but of the 108, 985 total donated <b>blood</b> <b>units,</b> only 21, 347 were distributed to the hospitals around the country. The hospitals in the Kerman region were overwhelmed in the first days after the earthquake, but they received only 1231 <b>units</b> of <b>blood,</b> a mere 1.3  % of the total blood donated during the first four days after the earthquake. A high number of <b>blood</b> <b>units</b> were discarded because of blood safety issues (Abolghasemi et al. 2008). Poor national blood transfusion organization highlighted the lack of major disaster planning and emergency preparedness for the supply, coordination, and transfer of blood supplies, and necessity of efficient communication between hospitals and blood collection centers. It was identified that 76  % of the <b>blood</b> <b>units</b> that reached the hospitals of Kerman Province were provided by neighboring provinces. For instance, Yazd Province with 923 <b>blood</b> <b>units</b> provided the highest number of <b>blood</b> <b>units.</b> Mobilizing first those provinces with rapid and easy access to the disaster area is vital in disaster planning for the blood supplies (Abolghasemi et al. 2008).|$|R

40|$|Background Donor blood {{screening}} test for antibody against hepatitis C virus (HCV) by third generation ELISA is widely used. However, {{there is still}} a window period during which a donor may already be infected despite a negative {{screening test}}. Objectives To determine the prevalence of hepatitis C infection in thalassemic children who had received screened donor blood and to seek the association between HCV infection and the number of <b>blood</b> <b>unit</b> transfusions received. Methods This was an analytic cross-sectional study. Sixty-seven children who had received third generation ELISA screened donor blood were examined for HCV antibody. The study was conducted in Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, from January to March 2004. The prevalence of hepatitis C was presented in per- centage. The association between HCV infection and sex, age, interval between transfusions, and the number of <b>blood</b> <b>unit</b> trans- fusions received was determined by univariate analysis and logis- tic regression analysis. Results In univariate analysis, significant difference between HCV- infected and uninfected subjects was found in the mean age and mean number of blood units transfused (P< 0. 001). In logistic re- gression analysis, we found a significant association between the quantity of transfused blood with positive HCV antibody (P< 0. 001). The odds ratio for positive HCV antibody was 1. 08 for each <b>blood</b> <b>unit</b> transfusion received (95 %CI 1. 02; 1. 14). The prevalence of hepatitis C in thalassemic children who received third generation ELISA screened blood was 22. 4 % (95 %CI 12. 4 %; 32. 4 %). This prevalence is lower than that in a previous study of thalassemic children receiving unscreened blood (50. 8 %).
