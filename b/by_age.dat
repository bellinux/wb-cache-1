5|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common serious {{neurological}} disorders affecting about 39 million people as of 2015. It affects 1% of the population <b>by</b> <b>age</b> 20 and 3% of the population <b>by</b> <b>age</b> 75. It is more common in males than females with the overall difference being small. Most of those with the disorder (80%) are in the developing world.|$|E
5|$|A {{second type}} are the intraductal {{papillary}} mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). These are macroscopic lesions, which {{are found in}} about 2% of all adults. This rate rises to ~10% <b>by</b> <b>age</b> 70. These lesions have about a 25% risk of developing into invasive cancer. They may have KRAS gene mutations (~40–65% of cases) and in the GNAS Gs alpha subunit and RNF43, affecting the Wnt signaling pathway. Even if removed surgically, there remains a considerably increased risk of pancreatic cancer developing subsequently.|$|E

25|$|The {{death rates}} at extreme old ages start to slow down, {{which is the}} {{opposite}} of what would be expected if death <b>by</b> <b>ageing</b> was programmed. From an individual-selection point of view, having genes that would not result in a programmed death <b>by</b> <b>ageing</b> would displace genes that cause programmed death <b>by</b> <b>ageing,</b> as individuals would produce more offspring in their longer lifespan and they could increase the survival of their offspring by providing longer parental support.|$|R

Any increase in height beyond the post-pubertal age is uncommon. Girls attain reproductive maturity {{about four years}} after the first physical changes of puberty appear. In contrast, boys accelerate more slowly but continue to grow for about six years after the first visible pubertal changes.|$|R
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>age</b> sixteen, Sampson was {{teaching}} at Indian Creek School in Laurel County. He attended Union College in Barbourville, then enrolled at Valparaiso University. He was class president for three years, and earned an A.B. in 1894.

30|$|The tensile {{strength}} of the specimen immersed in 0.2 % APF solution was completely recovered <b>by</b> <b>aging</b> {{at room temperature for}} 240 h, whereas that of the cathodically hydrogen-charged specimen was only partially recovered <b>by</b> <b>aging</b> at room temperature for 240 h (Yokoyama et al. 2007). In the case of aging at room temperature for 24 h after hydrogen charging, the dominant factor that influences the {{tensile strength}} of the specimen is the amount of hydride. However, dissociation of the hydride <b>by</b> <b>aging</b> at room temperature for 240 h was confirmed in both specimens. Therefore, the difference in the tensile strength of both specimens aged at room temperature for 240 h cannot be explained by the amount of hydride.|$|R

5|$|The {{biological}} half-life of strontium in humans has variously been reported as from 14 to 600 days, 1000 days, 18 years, 30 years and, at an upper limit, 49 years. The wide-ranging published {{biological half-life}} figures are explained by strontium's complex metabolism within the body. However, by averaging all excretion paths, the overall biological half-life {{is estimated to}} be about 18 years. The elimination rate of strontium is strongly affected <b>by</b> <b>age</b> and sex, due to differences in bone metabolism.|$|E

5|$|The {{incidence}} of TBI varies <b>by</b> <b>age,</b> gender, region and other factors.

5|$|A {{number of}} risk scores exist to predict {{bleeding}} in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled {{high blood pressure}} (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined <b>by</b> <b>age</b> over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding risk may be increased in people on hemodialysis. Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification. The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E
5|$|Addie Joss {{was born}} in Woodland, Dodge County, Wisconsin. His parents Jacob and Theresa (née Staudenmeyer) worked as farmers; his father, a cheesemaker who was {{involved}} in local politics, had emigrated from Switzerland. A heavy drinker of alcohol, he died from liver complications in 1890, when Joss was 10 years old; Joss remained sober throughout his life {{as a result of his}} father's death. Joss attended elementary school in Juneau and Portage and high school at Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. <b>By</b> <b>age</b> 16 he finished high school and began teaching himself. He was offered a scholarship to attend St. Mary's College (also known as Sacred Heart College) in Watertown, where he played on the school's baseball team. He also attended the University of Wisconsin (now University of Wisconsin-Madison), where he studied engineering. Officials in Watertown were impressed with the quality of play of St. Mary's and put the team on a semipro circuit. During his time on the semipro circuit, Joss employed his unique pitching windup, which involved hiding the ball until the very last moment in his delivery.|$|E

5|$|Aging / Curing: While {{not always}} {{required}}, some teas required additional aging, secondary fermentation, or baking {{to reach their}} drinking potential. For instance, a green tea puerh, prior to curing into a post-fermented tea, is often bitter and harsh in taste, but becomes sweet and mellow through fermentation <b>by</b> <b>age</b> or dampness. Additionally, oolong can benefit from aging if fired over charcoal. Flavoured teas are manufactured in this stage by spraying the tea with aromas and flavours or by storing them with their flavorants.|$|E

The childhood supporter of Red Star Belgrade spent his formative years in the youth teams of his hometown club FK Sloga Doboj as a goalkeeper and later, as a midfielder. He also took up kayaking at the age of 12 on the advice of the doctor treating his growth disorder of the chest.
