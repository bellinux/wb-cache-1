40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of a micro Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) blade using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The 1. 5 m long micro HAWT blade was designed using the Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEM). Parameters such as the chord length lift force, drag force, tip speed ratio, solidity, coefficient of performance, angle of attack, wind relative angle, Reynolds number, efficiency, axial and induction factors were determined. Based on the design parameters the micro blade was created, meshed and boundary conditions identified in a 2 D pre-processor Gambit interface. The meshed blade was exported to Fluent where it was processed and analyzed based on the identified boundary condition. The blade was simulated based on Maiduguri environment which has a recorded average wind speed of 3. 89 m/s and the result showed that the maximum extractable power was 142. 66 watts at a wind relative velocity of 4. 8 m/s when the blade was at 8 o angle of attack and 3 x 106 Reynolds Number. Measured power increased consistently with increased in wind speed, and with a turbine efficiency of 28 % the blade satisfied the Newton’s third law and the <b>Bernoulli’s</b> <b>effect.</b> The profile had the ability to perform and serve as a means of extracting and generating energy from wind, which is a renewable, clean and locally available source of energy in Maiduguri and its environs. The use of this energy source will reduce the large dependence on non-renewable, expensive and environmentally unfriendly means of energy generation. Further studies could be carried experimentally to verify the simulation results...|$|R
40|$|We {{theoretically}} study hydrodynamic phenomena {{originating from}} electron-electron collisions in a two-dimensional Fermi system. We demonstrate that an electron beam sweeping past an aperture creates a pumping effect, attracting carriers from this aperture. This pumping effect originates from the specific electric potential distribution {{induced by the}} injected electrons. In the regions nearby the main stream of injected electrons, a positive potential is induced by the injected electrons. Thus, the normally repulsive Coulomb interaction leads to an attractive force in the Fermi system. This quantum pumping mechanism in a Fermi system differs qualitatively from the <b>Bernoulli</b> pumping <b>effect</b> in classical liquids. We also discuss possible experimental realizations.

40|$|Although {{self-excited}} oscillations in collapsible channel flows {{have been}} extensively studied, {{our understanding of}} their origins and mechanisms is still far from complete. In the present paper, {{we focus on the}} stability and energy budget of collapsible channel flows using a fluid–beam model with the pressure-driven (inlet pressure specified) condition, and highlight its differences to the flow-driven (i. e. inlet flow specified) system. The numerical finite element scheme used is a spine-based arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian method, which is shown to satisfy the geometric conservation law exactly. We find that the stability structure for the pressure-driven system is not a cascade as in the flow-driven case, and the mode- 2 instability is no longer the primary onset of the self-excited oscillations. Instead, mode- 1 instability becomes the dominating unstable mode. The mode- 2 neutral curve is found to be completely enclosed by the mode- 1 neutral curve in the pressure drop and wall stiffness space; hence no purely mode- 2 unstable solutions exist in the parameter space investigated. By analysing the energy budgets at the neutrally stable points, we can confirm that in the high-wall-tension region (on the upper branch of the mode- 1 neutral curve), the stability mechanism is the same as proposed by Jensen and Heil. Namely, self-excited oscillations can grow by extracting kinetic energy from the mean flow, with exactly two-thirds of the net kinetic energy flux dissipated by the oscillations and the remainder balanced by increased dissipation in the mean flow. However, this mechanism cannot explain the energy budget for solutions along the lower branch of the mode- 1 neutral curve where greater wall deformation occurs. Nor can it explain the energy budget for the mode- 2 neutral oscillations, where the unsteady pressure drop is strongly influenced by the severely collapsed wall, with stronger <b>Bernoulli</b> <b>effects</b> and flow separations. It is clear that more work is required to understand the physical mechanisms operating in different regions of the parameter space, and for different boundary conditions...|$|R
5000|$|The Bernoulli {{principle}} {{is not the}} only mechanic in generating ground effect downforce. A large part of ground effect performance comes from taking advantage of viscosity. In the tarp example above neither the tarp nor the ground is moving. The boundary layer between the two surfaces works to slow down the air between them which lessens the <b>Bernoulli</b> <b>effect.</b> When a car moves over the ground the boundary layer on the ground becomes helpful. In the reference frame of the car, the ground is moving backwards at some speed. As the ground moves, it pulls on the air above it and causes it to move faster. This enhances the <b>Bernoulli</b> <b>effect</b> and increases downforce. It is an example of Couette flow.

40|$|We {{describe}} both experimentally and theoretically a hydrodynamic pumping {{mechanism in}} a Fermi liquid, arising from electron-electron interaction. An electron beam sweeping past an aperture is observed to pump carriers from this aperture. Experimentally, the pumping effect induces a current {{in the lead}} connected to the aperture, or induces a voltage signal corresponding to carrier extraction from the lead. Different geometries display the effect, and this work discusses one experimental geometry in detail. Theoretically, {{the solution of the}} Boltzmann equation, including an electron-electron collision integral, shows that the potential induced by injected electrons becomes positive in the regions nearby the main stream of injected electrons. Thus, the repulsive Coulomb interaction leads to an attractive, pumping force in the Fermi liquid. The pumping mechanism here described is shown to be qualitatively different from the <b>Bernoulli</b> pumping <b>effect</b> in classical liquids.

In particular, we emphasize that global U(1) phase rotation symmetry, and not gauge symmetry, is spontaneously violated, and show that the BCS wave function is, contrary to claims in the literature, fully gauge invariant. We discuss {{the nature of the}} order parameter, the physical origin of the many degenerate states, and the relation between formulations of superconductivity with fixed particle numbers vs. well defined phases. We motivate and to some extend derive the effective field theory at low temperatures, explore symmetries and conservation laws, and justify the classical nature of the theory. Most importantly, we show that the entire phenomenology of superconductivity essentially follows from the single assumption of a charged order parameter field. This phenomenology includes Anderson's characteristic equations of superfluidity, electric and magnetic screening, the <b>Bernoulli</b> Hall <b>effect,</b> the balance of the Lorentz force, as well as the quantum effects, in which Planck's constant manifests itself through the compactness of the U(1) phase field.

Here, ultra high-speed imaging was used to capture the complete bubble contour and quantify the gas flow through the neck. The high temporal resolution images enable us to approach the final moment of pinch-off to within 1 μs. It revealed that during the collapse, the flow of gas reverses and accelerates towards its maximum velocity at the moment of pinch-off. However, the resulting decrease in pressure, due to Bernoulli suction, is too low to account for the accelerated collapse. We observe two stages of the collapse process. At first, the neck collapses with a scaling exponent of 1 / 3 which is explained by a “filling effect. ” In the final stage, the collapse is characterized by a scaling exponent of 2 / 5, which can be derived, based on the observation that during the collapse the neck becomes less slender, due to the driving through liquid inertia.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the exponential H∞ filtering {{problem for a}} class of discrete-time switched neural networks with random time-varying delays. The involved delays {{are assumed to be}} randomly time-varying which are characterized by introducing a <b>Bernoulli</b> stochastic variable. <b>Effects</b> of both variation range and distribution probability of the time delays are considered. The nonlinear activation functions are assumed to satisfy the sector conditions. Our aim is to estimate the state by designing a full order filter such that the filter error system is globally exponentially stable with an expected decay rate and a H∞ performance attenuation level. The filter is designed by using a piecewise Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional together with linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach and average dwell time method. First, a set of sufficient LMI conditions are established to guarantee the exponential mean-square stability of the augmented system and then the parameters of full-order filter are expressed in terms of solutions to a set of LMI conditions. The proposed LMI conditions can be easily solved by using standard software packages. Finally, numerical examples by means of practical problems are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter design.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{basis of}} natural ventilation is reviewed and the ventilation performance examined of six different greenhouse and tunnel types equipped with either roof or side, or both roof and side vents. Altogether, sixteen different ventilation configurations are analysed. Neural networks of ventilation rate were first developed to select relevant parameters influencing performance and these {{confirmed that the}} surface area of the vent-opening and wind speed together explain the largest part of the variance of air exchange rate measurements. Ventilation performance is then analysed using physical models derived from <b>Bernoulli's</b> theorem. The <b>effects</b> of vent-opening, their position and type, {{and the influence of}} a crop are all considered, together with different models combining the two major driving forces for natural ventilation, namely, wind and stack forces. Combining both wind and stack effects did not improve the predictive power of the model for the greenhouses equipped with only roof or side vents, but when both roof and side vents are open together, model performance is improved by combination of the two driving forces. It is shown too that the presence of a crop decreases the ventilation efficiency and that the linear dependence of the air exchange rate on wind velocity, when the chimney effect can be neglected, is only partially supported by the experimental data.

40|$|The first passive Inflow Control Devices (ICDs), were {{introduced}} in the early 1990 ’s. Their task is to provide an additional choking effect in long reach horizontal wells and to eliminate heel-toe effect. There are several passive inflow control devices available today starting from the nozzle, helical/channel and tube type. Since none of them is able to provide additional choking effect, when the breakthrough occurs, the more advanced Autonomous Inflow Control Devices (AICDs) had to be developed. The primary function of any AICD {{is to be able}} to provide additional pressure drop when the breakthrough occurs, and unwanted fluids start flowing. There are some differences in the functionality and principles between available AICDs on todays market, and every device has its own range of abilities. Some of them are water and/or gas stopper valve, and some of them are flow controller valves. Water and gas stopper AICDs, are able to autonomously choke production of water and/or gas when it starts flowing, and allow oil producing zones to produce more easily, and most of them have the flow control ability in addition. On the other hand, flow controller AICDs are only regulating the flow rate, in order to keep it relatively constant or in predetermined limits. As a result, all of them have slightly different performance characteristics for different fluid types and flow properties.

5000|$|Sports {{cars are}} most {{commonly}} seen with {{front and rear}} spoilers. Even though these vehicles typically have a more rigid chassis and a stiffer suspension to aid in high speed maneuverability, a spoiler can still be beneficial. This is because many vehicles have a fairly steep downward angle going from the rear {{edge of the roof}} down to the trunk or tail of the car which may cause air flow separation. The flow of air becomes turbulent and a low-pressure zone is created, increasing drag and instability (see <b>Bernoulli</b> <b>effect).</b> Adding a rear spoiler could be considered to make the air [...] "see" [...] a longer, gentler slope from the roof to the spoiler, which helps to delay flow separation and the higher pressure in front of the spoiler can help reduce the lift on the car by creating downforce.

The air flow across the vertical shaft opening creates a lower pressure (see <b>Bernoulli</b> <b>effect)</b> and draws cool air up from the qanat tunnel, mixing with it.

In dry desert climates this can result in a greater than 15 °C reduction in the air temperature coming from the qanat; the mixed air still feels dry, so the basement is cool and only comfortably moist (not damp).

50|$|Like most {{gasoline}} stoves, the Svea 123 uses {{an inverted}} bell-shaped burner {{topped with a}} flame spreader (sometimes called a “target burner” or “plate burner” design). As the vaporized fuel exits the jet, it shoots upward and strikes {{the bottom of the}} flame spreader, where it mixes with air that is drawn into the burner housing by convection and, more importantly at higher flow rates, by <b>Bernoulli</b> <b>effect</b> entrainment. The air/fuel mixture flows around the bottom of the flame spreader where it burns with a blue flame. In this type of burner design, flame efficiency depends on how fast the vaporized fuel strikes the flame spreader and on how well the air and vaporized fuel mixes beneath the flame spreader (i.e., the amount of turbulence in the air/fuel mixing zone). As a result, this design works best at high fuel output levels; efficient combustion is indicated by a blue flame. As the fuel output is decreased (i.e., when the control valve is turned down) the velocity with which the fuel exits the jet is also decreased, and fuel mixing (i.e., the amount of turbulence in the air/fuel mixing zone) is likewise decreased. At very low fuel output levels, the fuel will no longer exit with sufficient velocity to fully strike the flame spreader and combustion will consequently be very inefficient, usually indicated by a yellow flame.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{is the use}} of low or null pitching moment airfoils, seen for example in the Horten series of sailplanes and fighters. These use an unusual wing aerofoil section with reflex or reverse camber on the rear or all of the wing. With reflex camber the flatter side of the wing is on top, and the strongly curved side is on the bottom, so the front section presents a high angle of attack while the back section is more horizontal and contributes no lift, so acting like a tailplane or the washed-out tips of a swept wing. Reflex camber can be simulated by fitting large elevators to a conventional airfoil and trimming them noticeably upwards; the center of gravity must also be moved forward of the usual position. Due to the <b>Bernoulli</b> <b>effect,</b> reflex camber tends to create a small downthrust, so the angle of attack of the wing is increased to compensate. This in turn creates additional drag. This method allows a wider choice of wing planform than sweepback and washout, and designs have included straight and even circular (Arup) wings. But the drag inherent in a high angle of attack is generally regarded as making the design inefficient, and only a few production types, such as the Fauvel and Marske Aircraft series of sailplanes, have used it.|$|E
