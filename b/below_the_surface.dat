40|$|Abstract: Because of {{the smaller}} {{cross-sectional}} area, the flexural properties often become the controlling factor in PHC pile. Φ 500 PHC is widely used as an engineering design pile in the Yangtze River Delta region. On {{the basis of the}} analysis of pile soil interaction mechanism, the single Pile under different conditions is discussed. The parameters are discussed in this article are PHC pile’s wall thickness, horizontal loads, bending moments, pile elastic modulus and other engineering parameters. The studies show that, the distribution of bending moment and shear is significant in 2 ~ 4 m <b>below</b> <b>the</b> top <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> pile, and after 6 m, the value of them closes to 0. The main sphere of influence of the single pile bending moment and shear is concentrated at 3 ~ 4 m <b>below</b> <b>the</b> top <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> pile. Along with horizontal load enlargement, the maximum bending moment is mainly concentrated at 1. 5 m <b>below</b> <b>the</b> top <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> pile, and the maximum pile shear is mainly concentrated at 1. 9 m <b>below</b> <b>the</b> top <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> pile. Along with bending moment {{on the top of the}} pile enlarge, the maximum bending moment is mainly concentrated at 2. 5 m <b>below</b> <b>the</b> top <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> pile, and the maximum pile shear is mainly concentrated at 3. 0 m <b>below</b> <b>the</b> top <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> pile. Optimize sectional area of Φ 500 PHC should be selected as 0. 17, and the wall thickness should be selected as 170 mm...|$|R

5|$|This {{island is}} {{unlikely}} to disappear entirely in the near future. The eroded area consisted mostly of loose tephra, easily washed away. Most of the remaining area is capped by hard lava flows, which are much more resistant to erosion. In addition, complex chemical reactions within the loose tephra within the island have gradually formed highly erosion resistant tuff material, in {{a process known as}} palagonitization. On Surtsey this process has happened quite rapidly, due to high temperatures not far <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E

Widespread lighter motions were observed throughout much of the remaining region, with slight property damage reported from as far afield as Dunedin. The earthquake was felt as far away as New Plymouth and Invercargill.|$|E
