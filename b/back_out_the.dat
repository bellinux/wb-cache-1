5|$|This work {{maintains}} a heavy {{importance in the}} Art History world, as {{it is widely believed}} to be the first painting, since the fall of Rome (ca. 476 AD), to use Scientific Linear One Point Perspective, or, all the orthogonals point to one vanishing point, in this case, Christ. Also, it is one of the first paintings that does away with the use of a head-cluster. A technique employed by earlier Proto-Renaissance artists, such as Giotto or Duccio.

25|$|Cave diving {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{challenging}} and potentially dangerous kinds of diving or caving and presents many hazards. Cave diving is a form of penetration diving, meaning that in an emergency a diver cannot swim vertically to the surface due to the cave's ceilings, and so must swim the entire way <b>back</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> underwater navigation through the cave system may be difficult and exit routes may be at considerable distance, requiring the diver to have sufficient breathing gas to make the journey. The dive may also be deep, resulting in potential deep diving risks.|$|E
25|$|Alligators, {{much like}} birds, {{have been shown}} to exhibit {{unidirectional}} movement of air through their lungs. Most other amniotes are believed to exhibit bidirectional, or tidal breathing. For a tidal breathing animal, such as a mammal, air flows {{into and out of the}} lungs through branching bronchi which terminate in small dead-end chambers called alveoli. As the alveoli represent dead-ends to flow, the inspired air must move <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> same way it came in. In contrast, air in alligator lungs makes a circuit, moving in only one direction through the parabronchi. The air first enters the outer branch, moves through the parabronchi, and exits the lung through the inner branch. Oxygen exchange takes place in extensive vasculature around the parabronchi.|$|E

25|$|Thread forming is {{performed}} using a , or , which closely resembles a cutting tap without the flutes. There are lobes periodically spaced around the tap that actually do the thread forming as the tap is advanced into a properly sized hole. Since the tap does not produce chips, {{there is no need}} to periodically <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> tap to clear away chips, which, in a cutting tap, can jam and break the tap. Thus thread forming is particularly suited to tapping blind holes, which are tougher to tap with a cutting tap due to the chip build-up in the hole. Note that the tap drill size differs from that used for a cutting tap and that an accurate hole size is required because a slightly undersized hole can break the tap. Proper lubrication is essential because of the frictional forces involved, therefore a lubricating oil is used instead of cutting oil.|$|E

Just prior to firing, the glass is [...] "pumped" [...] to a high-energy state with a series of xenon flash tubes, causing a population inversion of the neodymium (Nd) atoms in the glass. This readies them for amplification via stimulated emission when a small amount of laser light, generated externally in a fibre optic, is fed into the beamlines. The glass is not particularly effective at transferring power into the beam, so to get as much power as possible <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> beam is reflected through the glass four times in a mirrored cavity, each time gaining more power.

2500|$|The {{legend of}} the wind blowing around the cathedral is as follows: In olden days, the Devil flew over the ground, riding the wind.

It is true that his back opens up and toads and snakes come out of it, but none of the na√Øve girls notices that [...] nor do many tourists for that matter. Very flattered and curious, the Devil had the idea to enter to see whether there were other sculptures representing him on the inside of the cathedral. Taken captive inside the holy place, he could not come <b>back</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> wind always waits in the square and still howls today from impatience on the places outside the cathedral. The Devil, furious, makes air currents from the bottom of the church to the height of the pillar of angels.|$|E
2500|$|For {{commercial}} harvesting, collectors {{use either}} basking traps or hoop traps. The basking trap is a floating enclosures with sloping sides and a basking surface. Turtles {{are able to}} climb up the sloping sides onto the basking surface, but then when they jump off into the center, they can't get back out. Hoop traps are cylindrical mesh traps with a funnel opening. Hoop traps are submerged and turtles are attracted by bait. In Minnesota, trappers say that they prefer basking traps to target painted turtles and hoop traps for [...] "meat" [...] turtles (snapping turtles and softshell turtles). Minnesota harvest records also show a clear pattern of most painted turtles coming from basking traps and most softshell and snapping turtles from hoop traps. Three quantitative studies of basking traps also show they are more efficient than baited hoop traps for trapping painted turtles. Despite the many hours of night and cloudiness when the basking traps do not lure turtles, the painted turtle's drive to bask is so powerful, that on a per-day basis, these traps are twice as effective. Or, possibly, the basking traps are more effective since painted turtles frequently escape <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> funnel of hoop traps.|$|E

2500|$|Located to {{the north}} of Old Portsmouth, the area where the ground is located was a sea inlet in the 17th century, across which was a dam. [...] The dam allowed the sea into the inlet when the tide came in, and when the tide went <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> dam was closed and the water was only allowed to escape under a watermill, named King's Mill, which powered the {{production}} of grain in the mill. After this, the land was gradually reclaimed from the sea. There is evidence that cricket has been played at the United Services Recreation Ground since 1852. [...] The ground in its present location {{is said to have been}} made available following largescale demolition of defence works in the city during the 1870s. First-class cricket was first played there on 17, 18 and 19 August 1882, when the touring Australians played Cambridge University Past and Present. This first match was won by Cambridge University Past and Present by 20 runs, following an Australian batting collapse in which A. G. Steel took 5/24. Hampshire first played there a week after the first match, against Sussex in which they lost by an innings. [...] Over the coming decade the ground was used once by G.N. Wyatt's XI, on three occasions by Oxford and Cambridge Universities Past and Present and twice by the East of England. Hampshire lost first-class status during this period and were considered a second-class county, though Hampshire did play at the ground once during this period against Sussex in 1888. The 1893 match between the Australians and Oxford and Cambridge Universities Past and Present was notable for the Australians setting what was then a record first-class innings score of 843. The amateur level Royal Artillery (Portsmouth) Football Club also played at the ground during the late 1890s, before the club was dissolved in 1898 because of an 1898 FA Amateur Cup tie in which The Football Association expelled Royal Artillery Portsmouth from the competition for alleged 'professionalism'. Out of the ashes of Royal Artillery, the present day Portsmouth F.C. was born.|$|E
