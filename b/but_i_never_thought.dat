500|$|Reagan's {{ability to}} connect with Americans earned him the laudatory moniker [...] "The Great Communicator." [...] Of it, Reagan said, [...] "I won the {{nickname}} the great communicator. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> it was my style that made a difference—it was the content. I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things." [...] His age and soft-spoken speech gave him a warm grandfatherly image.|$|E
500|$|Tessa {{occasionally}} meets MacLeod's previous Immortal lovers. In [...] "", {{she immediately}} dislikes Amanda (played by Elizabeth Gracen) and the script notes that [...] "...sparks fly {{between the two}} women". Although she quickly earns Amanda's respect, Tessa feels like she has to compete with Amanda, while Amanda comments that Tessa is [...] "...quite refreshing in a gauche sort of way." [...] Gracen played Amanda's interaction with Tessa ambiguously and a little flirtatiously. Tessa is usually jealous of MacLeod's past lovers, but acknowledges in [...] "" [...] that [...] "...it would take me several lifetimes to find out everything in Duncan's past. I know there've been others, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> I would meet one of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Of large build, ruddy countenance and of cheery disposition, Ulyett was {{a typical}} Yorkshireman" [...] He was clean hitter of a cricket ball and a fast bowler with [...] "a high action". Lyttleton also says {{he was not a}} {{particularly}} skilful bowler: [...] "He pounded away straight and hard <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that he used his head much".|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mean your}} character," [...] he said determinedly. [...] "I {{have always known}} how strong and noble it was, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> quite <b>thought</b> you could do {{anything}} so beautiful as this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Give it me," [...] he bade her, waxing fierce. [...] "Gad! It was folly to {{have told}} you of it. I had not done so <b>but</b> that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> you such a fool as to oppose {{yourself}} to the thing we intend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Such quick {{speaking}} is not perhaps {{natural to}} me. But as you demand an immediate answer, I must give you one. I have had much pleasure in your society, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of loving you. Nor can I love you without thinking of it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Conor Oberst {{has stated}} that the sound of The People's Key {{moves away from the}} folk sound that the band had {{accomplished}} on previous records. [...] "We're over the Americana, rootsy, whatever that sound is. People say country <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> we were very country at all. But whatever that element is or that aesthetic is, I guess it's worn a little thin for me these days. So we very much wanted it to be rocking and, {{for lack of a better}} term, contemporary, or modern." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{redesign}} was criticised by {{some for}} having no specifically Welsh symbol (such as the Welsh Dragon), because the Royal Shield {{does not include}} a specifically Welsh symbol. Wrexham MP Ian Lucas, who was also campaigning to have the Welsh Dragon included on the Union Flag, called the omission [...] "disappointing", and stated {{that he would be}} writing to the Queen to request that the Royal Standard be changed to include Wales. The Royal Mint stated that [...] "the Shield of the Royal Arms is symbolic of the whole of the United Kingdom and as such, represents Wales, Scotland, England and Northern Ireland." [...] Designer Dent stated [...] "I am a Welshman and proud of it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> about the fact we did not have a dragon or another representation of Wales on the design because as far as I am concerned Wales is represented on the Royal Arms. This was never an issue for me." ...|$|E
60|$|PATRICIA. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> fairies {{were like}} you. Why, you are taller than I am.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Ramsey: [...] "And I don't like Mr. Ashley at all. Of course I respect him--and I {{admire his}} intellect; there's no {{question}} about his being handsome; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of {{him for a moment}} in any other way; and now I can't even respect him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From my own vine," [...] {{answered}} Philemon. [...] "You may {{see one of}} {{its branches}} twisting across the window, yonder. <b>But</b> wife and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> the grapes very fine ones." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{paused for}} a moment before she {{answered}} him; but it was only for a moment, and then she spoke quite firmly. [...] "Yes, Godfrey, I do; I have thought about it much since then. I have thought, I fear, to no good purpose about aught else. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that we had been unwise in that." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Farnam {{gave her}} a {{thoughtful}} look. [...] "Well, that's plausible; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> you greedy. Why {{do you want the}} extra pay?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Me! Johnny! Father's in {{a mortal}} rage {{with me for}} telling the captain, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> as how all the {{soldiers}} would come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Boys, I've been laying for you, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> I'd get {{a chance}} like this. If Murray only stays out three minutes--just three minutes!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, to be sure!" [...] quoth Mrs. Ledwich. [...] "I knew Mr. Norman {{was very}} clever, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> declare <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of such as this! I will try my poor utmost for those {{interesting}} natives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, my dear! You are a most {{fortunate}} girl,--most fortunate! <b>But</b> somehow <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of it, that a {{child of}} mine should come to live at Bragton and have it, one may say, partly as her own! It is odd after all that has come and gone. God bless you, my dear, and make you happy. You are a very fortunate child." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You!" [...] Mr. Harmer said, {{stopping}} suddenly. [...] "What, {{were you}} with them? I remember {{now that the}} account {{said it was a}} one-armed sailor, <b>but</b> of course <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> for a moment of its being you." ...|$|R
6000|$|SIR JOHN. I {{knew your}} views were extreme in many ways, Stephen, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> {{the husband of}} my {{daughter}} would be a Peace-at-any-price man! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me! {{all this}} may be true, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of it before. I never thought that these {{hard-working}} people had any ideas of taste!" ...|$|E
60|$|KIT. Pew, I {{may have}} gifts; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of that. Why, no: not seaman-like. Pew, you've a heart, that's what I like you for.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be {{too hard}} upon a fellow, Bradley," [...] said Mainwaring as Bradley {{remained}} dark and motionless in the shadow. [...] "It is a poor return I'm making you for your kindness, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> swear <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of anything like--like--this." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{filled me}} with amazement. [...] "That is true," [...] I exclaimed, [...] "when one comes to think of it. It shows the same {{temperament}} in fibre.... <b>But</b> <b>I</b> should <b>never</b> have <b>thought</b> of it." ...|$|R
2500|$|I {{remember}} really vividly, you know, having {{pizza with}} my friends {{a day or two}} after—I opened up the first version of Facebook at the time I thought, [...] "You know, someone needs to build a service like this for the world." [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> just <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that we'd be the ones to help do it. And I think a lot of {{what it comes down to}} is we just cared more.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never learned}} how to observe. Of course I know that some matches turn out well and some don't, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> much about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|SIR JOHN. I {{knew your}} views were extreme in many ways, Stephen, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> {{the husband of}} my {{daughter}} would be a Peace-at-any- price man! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, many a time I've {{looked at}} people smoking, and thought well I wish I could do that; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> I could," [...] said Tom.|$|E
6000|$|... "Four days is the longest," [...] said he. [...] "You won't {{believe that}} story.... It was in Paris, and I had lost my {{money on the}} race-course. There was some due from home which didn't come. Four days and nights I lived on water. My clothes were excellent, and <b>I</b> had jewellery; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> even <b>thought</b> of pawning them. I {{suffered}} most from the notion that people might guess my state. You don't recognise me now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is what beats me," [...] he remarked. [...] "I {{can never}} figure out your European politics, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> should <b>never</b> have <b>thought</b> that England and Germany {{would have allowed}} a small, unoffending country to be overrun and grabbed {{by a lot of}} heathen infidels." ...|$|R
60|$|I was too angry {{to return}} to the cabin, and paced up and down the cold deck biting my lips with vexation. I had so {{expressly}} stipulated with the agents that no captain's wife was to come along. The last thing under the sun I desired in the pet quarters of a ship was a woman. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> about a captain's daughter. For two cents I was ready to throw the voyage over and return on the tug to Baltimore.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Quite so, Mr. Sampson; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of it. Let me see.' He {{took the}} printed paper from his pocket. 'How am I {{to answer all}} these questions?' ...|$|E
60|$|Oh, I {{have heard}} about their growing there, and {{staining}} the rivers brown, and making them good medicine to drink: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> there were any in Europe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you were}} mistaken," [...] {{he said at}} last, gently enough. [...] "I don't know why you should think so, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of marrying you-never thought of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so sorry," [...] Bertha Greendale said, [...] "so awfully sorry. I had no {{idea that}} you thought of me like that. We were such friends so long ago, and it has been so {{pleasant}} since you came home last year, and I like you as if you were a big brother; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of you in any other light, and now it seems dreadful to me to give you pain; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> feel sure that <b>I</b> should <b>never</b> come to love you in that way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You mean, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> {{would have}} found you," [...] {{retorted}} Lightfoot. [...] "I guess I owe these hunters more than you do. I owe them the greatest happiness I have ever known, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> would have <b>thought</b> of it myself. Isn't it queer how things which seem the very worst possible sometimes {{turn out to be}} the very best possible?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, no," [...] I {{was obliged}} to confess, [...] "it's {{one of the richest}} roads in the country. The stock stands at about 180. But I'm really afraid we shall be late to supper if we don't get on," [...] I broke off; though I was not {{altogether}} sorry to arrive after the porter had disposed of the baggage. I dreaded another display of active sympathy on the part of my strange companion; I have often felt sorry myself for the porters of hotels, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of offering to help them handle the heavy trunks that they manage.|$|R
