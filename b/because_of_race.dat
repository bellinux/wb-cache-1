5|$|Another {{executive}} order, also in 1948, made {{it illegal}} to discriminate against persons applying for civil service positions based on race.

25|$|In February 1946, Heman Marion Sweatt, an African American man, {{applied to}} the University of Texas School of Law. He was denied {{admission}} <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>race,</b> and subsequently filed suit in Sweatt v. Painter (1950). The state had no law school for African Americans. Instead of granting Sweatt a writ of mandamus to attend the University of Texas, the trial court granted a continuance for six months to allow the state time to create a law school for blacks.|$|E

According to the 2010 US Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Israel and the Occupied Territories, Israeli law prohibits {{discrimination on the}} basis of race, and the government effectively enforced these prohibitions.|$|E
25|$|The S. 1980 (104th): Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 was {{introduced}} to Congress on June 19, 1996, but died because the Senate Committee found some places for improvement of the bill. It was sponsored by Republican Duncan Faircloth. On May 23, 1996, the House of Representatives introduced H.R. 3525 (104th): Church Arson Prevention Act. The Act was passed by both houses in Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton on July 3, 1996. This bill became law number Pub.L. 104-155. It was sponsored by Republican Henry Hyde. The bill was summarized by the Congressional Research Service as follows: “ makes Federal criminal code prohibitions against, and penalties for, damaging religious property or obstructing any person’s free exercise of religious beliefs applicable where the offense is in, or affects, interstate commerce.” One {{of the changes in}} the bill was the sentence increase for “defacing or destroying any religious real property <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>race,</b> color, or ethnic characteristics…” from 10 to 20 years. It also changed the statute of limitations from five years to seven years after the date the crime was committed. It reauthorizes the Hate Crimes Statistics Act.|$|E

25|$|Watts ran for Congress in 1994 {{to succeed}} Dave McCurdy, who had {{announced}} his retirement from the House of Representatives {{to run for the}} Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending. After a hard-fought primary campaign against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49percent to Apple's 48percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston. Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92percent name recognition in one poll. Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks. Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>race,</b> but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win. On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52percent of the vote as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction. He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House. Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} split was the proposed Fifteenth Amendment, which would prohibit the denial of suffrage <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>race.</b> In {{one of their most}} controversial moves, Anthony and Stanton campaigned against the amendment, insisting that women and African Americans should be enfranchised at the same time. [...] They said that by effectively enfranchising all men while excluding all women, the amendment would create an [...] "aristocracy of sex" [...] by giving constitutional authority to the idea that men were superior to women.|$|E
500|$|Although the Nazis were {{suspicious}} of {{the chairman of the}} local Olympic organizing committee, Theodor Lewald, as he had a Jewish grandmother, they quickly saw the propaganda potential in hosting the Olympic Games. Lewald had intended to stage the Games on a shoestring budget; instead, the resources of the Reich were thrown behind the effort. As the Nazi hatred of the Jews manifested itself in persecution, there were calls to move the Olympics from Germany, or alternatively, to boycott the Games. As head of the Olympic movement in the US, Brundage received many letters and telegrams urging action. In 1933 and 1934, the IOC worked to assure that, consistent with Olympic ideals, the Games would be open to all, and {{that there would be no}} discrimination <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>race</b> or religion. IOC President Comte Henri de Baillet-Latour wrote to Brundage in 1933, [...] "I am not personally fond of jews [...] and of the jewish [...] influence, but I will not have them molested in no way [...] whatsoever." [...] According to historical writer Christopher Hilton in his account of the 1936 Games, [...] "Baillet-Latour, and the great and good around him, had no idea what was coming, and if the [...] German delegates kept offering assurances, what else could they do but accept them?" [...] Baillet-Latour opposed boycotting the Games, as did Brundage (who had learned in 1933 that he was being considered for IOC membership).|$|E

2500|$|Homophobia in the Latino {{community}} is also prevalent within the United States. Many Latinos {{feel like a}} double minority for being both an ethnic minority and a sexual minority. As a result, queer Latinos must straddle multiple cultures at once and take on somewhat contradictory identities {{in order to maintain}} ties within each group – a concept Gloria Anzaldúa calls the [...] "mestiza consciousness". At the same time, they often have to create a [...] "borderland" [...] space for themselves {{that will allow them to}} freely express their sexuality without consequences. Because queer Latinos are often marginalized in both LGBT communities (<b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>race)</b> and Latino communities (because of sexuality), the borderland spaces that exist are often composed strictly of queer Latinos. An example of such a space would be the community that the magazine Esto no tiene nombre created among Latina lesbians around the world.|$|E
2500|$|A {{person may}} face {{persecution}} {{in his or}} her home country <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>race,</b> nationality, religion, ethnicity, or social group, and yet not be eligible for asylum because of certain bars defined by law. The most frequent bar is the one-year filing deadline. [...] If an application is not submitted within one year following the applicant’s arrival in the United States, the applicant is barred from obtaining asylum unless certain exceptions apply. However, the applicant can be eligible for other forms of relief such as Withholding of Removal, which is a less favorable type of relief than asylum because it does not lead to a Green Card or citizenship. [...] The deadline for submitting the application is not the only restriction that bars one from obtaining asylum. If an applicant persecuted others, committed a serious crime, or represents a risk to U.S. security, he or she will be barred from receiving asylum as well.|$|E

Exclusion of blacks from juries, the Court concluded, was a denial of equal protection to black defendants, since the jury had been [...] "drawn from a panel from which the State has expressly excluded every man of [...] race." [...] At the same time, the Court explicitly allowed sexism and other types of discrimination, saying that states [...] "may confine the selection to males, to freeholders, to citizens, to persons within certain ages, or to persons having educational qualifications.
