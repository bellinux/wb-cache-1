In this paper, we show that (1) <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> scheme is equivalent to <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> Diffie-Hellman key exchange scheme over Zn, and (2) impersonation is easier than <b>breaking.</b> <b>The</b> second result is obtained by proving that <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> RSA publickey cryptosystem reduces to <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> Diffie-Hellman scheme over Zn {{with respect to the}} polynomial-time many-one reducibility. ...|$|R

5|$|Grizzly Rage <b>breaks</b> <b>the</b> {{standard}} mold {{for many}} Syfy natural horror films {{in that the}} bear featured is a normal grizzly bear rather than a mutant or genetically altered animal. However, the bear and actors never appear {{together in the same}} frame, rather a man in a bear suit takes over the role when the actors must interact with the bear. Critics heavily panned the film, feeling its plot, script, characters, and special effects were substandard.|$|E

5|$|Like other {{biological}} macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins {{are essential}} parts of organisms {{and participate in}} virtually every process within cells. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle. In animals, proteins are needed in the diet to provide the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized. Digestion <b>breaks</b> <b>the</b> proteins down {{for use in the}} metabolism.|$|E
5|$|The {{preparation}} of haleem {{has been compared}} to that of Hyderabadi biryani.

This has made the dish synonymous with Ramadan. In recognition of its cultural significance and popularity, in 2010, it was granted Geographical Indication status (GIS) by the Indian GIS registry office, making it the first non-vegetarian dish in India to get this status.|$|E
5|$|Tile-based structures.

This was the dominant design strategy used from the mid-1990s until the mid-2000s, when the DNA origami methodology was developed.|$|E
