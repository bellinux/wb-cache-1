40|$|During {{preparations}} for {{the next round of}} multilateral trade negotiations, divergent views emerged among governments as to the scope of the round. In addition to the items mandated by the <b>Built-in</b> <b>Agenda</b> from the Uruguay Round, there were various proposals to extend the Round to other issues. For example, the EU and the US were in favour of adding labour and environment issues as well as some trade areas. Developing Countries stated that they are dissatisfied with the implementation of many Uruguay Round commitments such as the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, the excessive use of anti-dumping actions, and the failure to respect the principle of special and differential treatment. Equally many of the proposed items were strongly opposed by other nations; for example, the Developing Countries generally were determined to keep labour and investment issues out of the negotiations. Moreover, there are now 135 members of the WTO compared with 103 {{at the start of the}} Uruguay Round which may make “consensus” more difficult to achieve. In addition, there have been substantial changes in the world economy in the 1990 s. Capital is much more mobile internationally and exchange rates are more flexible. Man...|$|E
40|$|The {{end of the}} 20 th {{century will}} mark the {{beginning}} of a new era for the world trading system. More than 130 member countries of the World Trade Organization (WTO) will begin negotiations in 1999 on a broad range of subjects, including agriculture, services, intellectual property, and trade and the environment. The authors in this volume analyze the key issues that should be on the agenda of new WTO negotiations to meet the challenges generated by the Asian financial crisis, concerns about the impact of globalization on firms and workers, and the proliferation of regional trading pacts. They present a compelling case for comprehensive trade talks that include new issues such as investment and competition policy, in addition to subjects already part of the WTO's <b>built-in</b> <b>agenda.</b> The overview chapter by Jeffrey J. Schott examines the work of the WTO since its establishment in January 1995 (including its dispute settlement mechanism) and the key challenges facing new trade talks. In addition, Schott proposes a new negotiating strategy to produce concrete results without the lengthy delays of past trade talks. He recommends that governments commit to continuous negotiations in Geneva and use the regularly scheduled meetings of trade ministers to conclude a balanced "round-up" of agreements every two years. An appendix contains statements made by WTO Director General Renato Ruggiero and US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky on the importance of WTO negotiations and the key US objectives in pursuing those talks. ...|$|E
40|$|Written {{prior to}} the WTO conference in Seattle, this paper {{identifies}} negotiating strategies and areas of benefits from a new multilateral round of trade negotiations for developing countries. Although the attempts to launch a round at Seattle failed, the strategy outlined in the paper remains relevant, should fresh efforts be made to launch a round. From the viewpoint of overall strategy, developing countries should limit the agenda for anew round to the built-in Uruguay Round (UR), agenda plus trade liberalization in industrial goods. From the long-run perspective, they need to commit substantial human and financial resources {{to the creation of}} native research and negotiating capacity on WTO-related issues. The areas covered in the paper include trade liberalization, multilateral agreement on investment, dispute settlement, anti-dumping, and labour and environmental standards. Expected benefits from liberalization in industrial products to developing countries justify their inclusion in the new round, even though they are {{not a part of the}} UR <b>built-in</b> <b>agenda.</b> In agriculture, developing countries must watch out against the proliferation of sanitary and phytosanitary(SPS) measures, which threaten to turn into the most important barrier against their agricultural exports as this sector is liberalized. On electronic commerce, a key objective should be to classify it as trade in services. Developing countries should then seek the liberalization of services by developed countries in sectors in which they can export services electronically. There is an acute need to improve the access of developing countries to the legal and professional services necessary to get a fair hearing in the Dispute Settlement Body. Developed countries have substantial in-house resource to devote to disputes which developing countries lack. In the short run, this asymmetry must be corrected by the provision of resources that allow developing countries to hire private legal experts. In the long run, developing countries must develop their own in-house expertise. Time is not yet ripe for a multilateral agreement on investment. Should developed countries nevertheless insist upon it, its scope should be limited to direct foreign investment. Even then, developing countries should insist on a parallel agreement on the movement of natural persons. On other non-trade agenda issues, labour standards should be taken out of the WTO and delegated to the International Labour Organization. Likewise, most of the environmental agenda should be delegated to the United Nations Environmental Protection Agency. ...|$|E
40|$|Trade {{liberalization}} {{has been}} received {{around the world}} with mixed emotions. The completion of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in December 1993 brought conversations about international trade into the conversation of the general public in a significant way for the first time. What is most important, individuals against or concerned about increased global trade have successfully organized themselves into forces of recognition, taking the conversations about trade from the back rooms into the streets. This was manifest at the Third, or Seattle, Ministerial Conference which was aimed at ushering in the Next Round of Trade Negotiations under the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 1999. During the volatile week in Seattle in December 1999, the focus of the media was primarily on the demonstrations and riots on the streets, with little or no coverage of the activities going on in the meetings at the Ministerial Conference. The WTO was unable to make a Ministerial Declaration to launch the next round of trade negotiations, leading some to think that any international trade liberalization effort has been derailed because of the demonstrations and riots. A number of questions emerge {{as a result of the}} events emanating from the Seattle Ministerial Conference, but three of these are of specific interest to this author: 1. What really happened at the Seattle Ministerial and why? 2. What are the implications of what happened to global trade negotiations in the future? 3. Why should Canada care? This paper addresses the above questions, looking at the issues leading up to the Ministerial, the structure of the Ministerial agenda and the positions tabled by various countries in an attempt to understand the outcome of the Seattle Ministerial. It also looks at the changes in the membership of the WTO and the negotiation processes and how these affect future global trade negotiations. We also assess the increasing importance of trade to Canada, arguing that there is an important role for Canada in the current negotiation to ensure its successful conclusion. The layout of the paper is as follows. The next section presents a brief summary of the <b>built-in</b> <b>agenda</b> that was agreed to at the end of the Uruguay Round, explaining the evolving nature of international trade rules and the changes that have occurred in international trade relations since the WTO came into force on January 1, 1995. The section following presents the agenda of the Seattle Ministerial, the positions on the critical subjects of negotiations including agriculture, implementation and rules, market access tabled by the various countries and condition that created for the ability of the Seattle Ministerial to achieve its objectives. The final section presents developments at the WTO since Seattle and what that means for Canada's agri-food industries. International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
