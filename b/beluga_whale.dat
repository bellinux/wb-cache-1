5|$|Fishing is the {{principal}} industry in Sisimiut, with harvested stocks of shrimps, salmon, halibut and cod. The Royal Greenland fish processing plant at the port is the largest within Greenland and is amongst the most modern shrimp-shelling factories in the world. In 2008, supplied by 8 boats and the factory trawlers, the plant processed an annual amount of 20,180 tons of shrimp, around 1,680 tons per month. This was roughly constant throughout the year, although when fish catches were larger the fish was frozen. The plant eventually sold around 6,019 tonnes of shrimp. Hunting {{is also important to}} some of the local livelihoods, mainly seals, walrus, <b>beluga</b> <b>whale,</b> narwhale, reindeer and muskoxen.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The playful, graceful {{motions of}} <b>Beluga</b> <b>whales</b> {{swimming}} in water create a mesmerizing motion space to watch. These highly communicative creatures {{use a variety}} of vocalization, physical expressions and physical contact in their navigation, social interaction and survival. <b>Beluga</b> <b>whales</b> have fatty structures on the top of their heads; it is hypothesized that these structures, called melons, act as acoustical lenses for focusing and directing sounds for echolocation. We have created an installation for participants to play with directional sounds initiated by the playful movement of <b>beluga</b> <b>whales</b> in the water. 2. DESCRIPTION We have produced an interactive multimedia installation piece for the Open Media Environment (aka Atrium) at the University of British Columbia. The installation uses Jitter to process a live webcam feed of the Beluga tank at the Vancouver Aquarium [1]. The motion of <b>Beluga</b> <b>whales</b> in the webcam view trigger various whale-based sounds to enter the sou...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Ethnohistoric records {{indicate}} that the economy of early historic Mackenzie Inuit was centred on the summer hunt for <b>beluga</b> <b>whales</b> (Delphinapterus leucas). However, no systematic attempt {{has been made to}} quantify the dietary importance of <b>beluga</b> <b>whales</b> to earlier, precontact-period Mackenzie Inuit societies. This issue is addressed herein through analysis of over 2000 beluga bones recovered from a semisubterranean house at Gupuk, a Mackenzie Inuit archaeological site on the East Channel of the Mackenzie River. The amount of meat and fat available from <b>beluga</b> <b>whales</b> is compared to that from all other prey species at the site to assess the relative dietary contribution of each taxon. The results indicate that <b>beluga</b> <b>whales</b> were a truly focal resource in the local economy, probably providing over half of the food available to residents of Gupuk and other communities in the Mackenzie Delta for at least half of each year...|$|R

25|$|Palin opposed {{strengthening}} {{protections for}} beluga whales in Alaska's Cook Inlet. She cited state scientists {{who claimed that}} hunting was the only factor causing the whales' decline and that the hunting had been effectively controlled through cooperative agreements with Alaska Native organizations. Recent research states that hunting controls have halted the decline of beluga whales in Cook's Inlet but that the population remains severely depleted and {{at high risk of}} extinction. Federal scientists do not attribute the decline in the Cook Inlet beluga population to human pollution. The Cook Inlet <b>Beluga</b> <b>Whale</b> was declared an endangered species by the Bush Administration on October 17, 2008.|$|E
25|$|Bears, foxes, otters, and sables are numerous, as are {{reindeer}} in the north, and musk deer, hares, squirrels, rats, {{and mice}} everywhere. The bird fauna is mostly the common east Siberian, {{but there are}} some endemic or near-endemic breeding species, notably the endangered Nordmann's greenshank (Tringa guttifer) and the Sakhalin leaf warbler (Phylloscopus borealoides). The rivers swarm with fish, especially species of salmon (Oncorhynchus). Numerous whales visit the sea coast, including the critically endangered Western Pacific gray whale, for which the coast of Sakhalin is the only known feeding ground. Other endangered whale species known to occur in this area are the North Pacific right whale, the bowhead whale and the <b>beluga</b> <b>whale.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Beluga</b> <b>whale</b> {{or white}} whale Delphinapterus leucas (cetuaq, assigarnaq, qecip'atuli in Yup'ik cituaq in Cup'ik, cetuar in Cup'ig) {{is used for}} human and dog food. Beluga {{harvested}} in spring are used primarily for human food, although some are used for dog food. Beluga harvests in the fall usually are lower than in spring. The late fall beluga hunts were used to produce food for the dogs. Parts of the beluga used for human food include the skin, fat, backstrap, and intestines. Backstrap meat is sometimes dried, and beluga skin is sometimes pickled. Beluga products are prepared a number of ways, such as boiling skin and meat (eaten hot or cold); flouring and frying or barbecuing backstraps; and processing fat into oil for use with dried fish and meat. Ways of preserving and using beluga products show local differences between communities and families.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>beluga</b> <b>whale</b> {{or white}} whale (Delphinapterus leucas) is an Arctic and sub-Arctic cetacean. It {{is one of}} two members of the family Monodontidae, along with the narwhal, and {{the only member of the}} genus Delphinapterus.

The tendons of large animals such as wild caribou (tuntu) and semi-domesticated {{reindeer}} (qusngiq), moose (tuntuvak), and <b>beluga</b> <b>whale</b> (cetuaq) (also, for other non-Yup'ik regions of Indigenous peoples of the North America: big horn sheep, black-tailed and white-tailed deer, elk or wapiti, and bison or buffalo) were used for sinew. Dried animal tendons known as sinew are used to make their clothing and footwear, and to sew bedding, tents and kayak covers. These tendons are usually sliced off the long muscles {{on either side of}} the spine of a caribou or <b>beluga</b> <b>whale.</b> Sometimes shorter tendons are taken from other animals' parts such as bird's foot. Yup'iks sewed using caribou (tuntut yualuit, tuntut ivaluit), moose (tuntuviit yualuit, tuntuviim eglua) or beluga (cetuat yualuit) sinews as thread in the old days. The hand-twisted sinew thread is yualukiuraq (in Yup'ik) or qip'ar (in Cup'ig). The iwalukegcaun (in Cup'ig) is wax or soap put on thread when sewing skin. The yualunguaq (in Yup'ik) is sinew thread for fish-skin.|$|E
