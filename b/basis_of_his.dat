5|$|Chesbro {{was elected}} to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946 by the Veterans Committee, though he had {{received}} little consideration from the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Some baseball historians consider the 1946 election a mistake, and believe that Chesbro was elected solely on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> 1904 season.|$|E
5|$|George Went Hensley (May 2, 1881 – July 25, 1955) was an American Pentecostal {{minister}} {{best known}} for popularizing the practice of snake handling. A native of rural Appalachia, Hensley experienced a religious conversion around 1910: on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> interpretation of scripture, he {{came to believe that}} the New Testament commanded all Christians to handle venomous snakes.|$|E
5|$|Yeats's mystical inclinations, {{informed}} by Hindu Theosophical beliefs and the occult, provided {{much of the}} <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> late poetry, which some critics have judged as lacking in intellectual credibility. The metaphysics of Yeats's late works must be read in relation to his system of esoteric fundamentals in A Vision (1925).|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of the retina was the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> research and <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> publications. Michaelson worked as a pathologist in an eye disease hospital in Glasgow {{and served as a}} lecturer at the University of Glasgow.|$|R
50|$|Clarence Arnold Elkins Sr. (born 1963) is an American {{man who was}} wrongfully {{convicted of}} the 1998 rape and murder <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother-in-law, Judith Johnson, Melinda Elkins's mother, and the rape and assault <b>of</b> <b>his</b> niece, Brooke. He was convicted solely on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> {{testimony}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> 6-year-old niece who testified that Elkins was the perpetrator.|$|R
5|$|Based on the {{theories}} of his predecessors, Zhang Heng systematically developed the celestial sphere theory. An armillary constructed on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It is astonishing that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates the celestial globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.|$|E
5|$|Born in London {{and raised}} largely in Brighton, Grinsell {{developed}} an early interest in archaeology through visits to Brighton Museum. Later {{working as a}} bank clerk in London, he embarked on archaeological research in an amateur capacity, visiting prehistoric barrows during his weekends and holidays in order to record their shape, dimensions, and location. On the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> research, he published a range of academic articles and {{books on the subject}} of barrows during the 1930s, gaining recognition as Britain's foremost expert on the subject. In 1933, he carried out his only archaeological excavation, at the Devil's Humps in Sussex.|$|E
5|$|Emanuel's {{eligibility}} for office was challenged on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lack of residency in Chicago {{for one year}} prior to the election. The Board of Elections and the Cook County Circuit Court affirmed his eligibility. A divided Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court, holding on January 24, 2011, that residency for purposes of a candidate is different from residency for purposes of being a voter. A further appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court resulted in a unanimous decision reversing the Court of Appeals and affirming Emanuel's eligibility.|$|E
5000|$|He contributed {{numerous}} articles, {{stories and}} poems to The Bulletin from 1901 and The Lone Hand, often under the pseudonym [...] "Kodak". He commenced {{writing as a}} young single man, working in a bicycle shop then for the International Harvester Company, {{and living in a}} series of boarding-houses, which formed the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> stories.|$|R
5000|$|Beatrice. She is the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> both <b>his</b> {{nervousness}} and romanticism. He is {{attracted to}} her exquisite delicacy despite [...] "no illusions about her" [...] and {{has a sense of}} superiority.|$|R

5|$|His {{work on the}} Newtonian limit, {{particularly}} in relation to cosmological solutions, led Ehlers, together with his former doctoral student Thomas Buchert, to a systematic study of perturbations and inhomogeneities in a Newtonian cosmos. This {{laid the groundwork for}} Buchert's later generalization of this treatment of inhomogeneities. This generalization was the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> attempt to explain what is currently seen as the cosmic effects of a cosmological constant or, in modern parlance, dark energy, as a non-linear consequence of inhomogeneities in general-relativistic cosmology.|$|E
5|$|Noddack was proven {{right after}} all. Fermi had {{dismissed}} {{the possibility of}} fission on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> calculations, {{but he had not}} taken into account the binding energy that would appear when a nuclide with an odd number of neutrons absorbed an extra neutron. For Fermi, the news came as a profound embarrassment, as the transuranic elements that he had partly been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering had not been transuranic elements at all, but fission products. He added a footnote to this effect to his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.|$|E
5|$|On 4 August Thorpe, {{along with}} Holmes {{and two of}} Holmes's associates, were charged with {{conspiracy}} to murder Scott. Thorpe was additionally charged with incitement to murder, on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> alleged 1968 discussions with Bessell and Holmes. After being released on bail, Thorpe declared his innocence and his determination to refute the charges. Although he remained North Devon's MP he withdrew almost completely from public view, except for a brief theatrical appearance at the Liberals' 1978 annual assembly on 14 September—to the annoyance of the party's leaders who {{had asked him to}} stay away.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to help to clarify Heidegger's {{conception}} of metaphysics as "history of esse" (Geschichte des Seins), namely on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> "leading" words (Leitworte), that is through the title "der Anfang" - beginning. The work tries to understand it using what the author terms as "anfängliches Denken", by following the initial grasp of esse...|$|R
5000|$|The 37th Mandala is {{a horror}} novel written by Marc Laidlaw and {{published}} in 1996. It {{tells the story of}} New Age writer Derek Crowe who uses an ancient mystical text as the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works. As his writing gains popularity, it also attracts the unwanted attention of the 37 mandalas [...] - [...] terrible Lovecraftian-style monsters [...] - [...] that the original text was about.|$|R
5000|$|When Nabokov died on July 2, 1977, he {{was still}} working on the novel, since retitled The Opposite of Laura and finally The Original of Laura. The {{incomplete}} manuscript consists of Nabokov's own handwriting across 138 index cards, {{the equivalent of about}} 30 manuscript pages. [...] The use of index cards was normal for Nabokov, the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works, such as Lolita and Pale Fire.|$|R
5|$|Percy George Herbert Fender (22 August 1892– 15 June 1985) was an English cricketer {{who played}} 13 Tests and was captain of Surrey between 1921 and 1931. An all-rounder, {{he was a}} middle-order batsman who bowled mainly leg spin, and {{completed}} the cricketer's double seven times. Noted as a belligerent batsman, in 1920 he hit the fastest recorded first-class century, reaching three figures in 35 minutes which remains a record in 2016. On the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Surrey captaincy, contemporaries judged him the best captain in England.|$|E
5|$|William and {{his brother}} Roger de Chesney were leading {{supporters}} of King Stephen in 1141, and were both leaders in Stephen's army that gathered at Winchester. In 1143, William de Chesney was given control {{of the town and}} royal castle at Oxford. He also held the town and castle of Deddington, which he had acquired at least by 1157, and possibly earlier. Although he did not begin the fortifications at Deddington Castle, it is likely that he began the first stone defences at the site. Deddington was Chesney's most important holding in Oxfordshire, and the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> power in the county.|$|E
5|$|At the 1928 {{election}} Bruce's {{government was}} returned to power, but it now had a majority of just nine a fragile result, given the growing propensity for Nationalist member defections. Most of the Nationalists' parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out. James Scullin had assumed {{the leadership of the}} ALP earlier in the year, upon the retirement of Charlton, and the party was invigorated as a consequence. Bruce was undeterred, though, and became convinced that unless costs of production for industry in Australia could be lowered and industrial peace secured, Australia was heading towards a major economic crisis. This doctrine was the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> appeals to the public for the next year and a half.|$|E
50|$|Neihardt {{was born}} in Sharpsburg, Illinois; {{his family moved to}} Wayne, Nebraska when he was 10. A {{graduate}} of Nebraska Normal College in Wayne at the age of 16, he taught in rural schools near Hoskins. Neihardt had been writing poetry since the age of 12; he published his first book, The Divine Enchantment, at the age of 19. The book is based on Hindu mysticism, which was the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> perspectives and underlay much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> later work.|$|R
50|$|During <b>his</b> Presidency <b>of</b> the International Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions {{he formed}} study groups of colleagues {{from around the}} world to learn from various {{cultures}} about child development and childhood disorders. He initiated this work, led it, and arranged for funding. This effort was the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> books. As a testament to his lasting legacy and expertise, this spring, two books on the subject contain introductions by Dr. Anthony.|$|R
50|$|Louis de Wohl, earlier Ludwig von Wohl, was a German-born Catholic author, and {{had served}} as an astrologer notable for his work with MI5 during World War II. Sixteen <b>of</b> <b>his</b> popular pre-war novels were the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> movies. <b>His</b> later novels are {{literary}} hagiographies of notable Roman Catholic saints and of different periods of the Bible.|$|R
5|$|Druitt rented legal {{chambers}} at 9 King's Bench Walk in the Inner Temple. In {{the late}} Victorian era only the wealthy could afford legal action, {{and only one}} in eight qualified barristers {{was able to make}} a living from the law. While some of Druitt's biographers claim his practice did not flourish, others suppose that it provided him with a relatively substantial income on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> costly lease of chambers and the value of his estate at death. He is listed in the Law List of 1886 as active in the Western Circuit and Winchester Sessions, and for 1887 in the Western Circuit and Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton Assizes.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan, now Abbot of Glastonbury, {{went to work}} at once on {{the task}} of reform. He had to re-create monastic life and to rebuild the abbey. He began by {{establishing}} Benedictine monasticism at Glastonbury. The Rule of St. Benedict was the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> restoration according to the author of 'Edgar's Establishment of the Monasteries' (written in the 960s or 970s) and according to Dunstan's first biographer, who {{had been a member of}} the community at Glastonbury. Their statements are also in accordance with the nature of his first measures as abbot, with the significance of his first buildings, and with the Benedictine leanings of his most prominent disciples.|$|E
5|$|During 1962 – 63, Bánáthy {{focused his}} research, {{using it as}} the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Master's Thesis at San Jose State University. The Monterey Bay Area Council {{published}} Bánáthy's abbreviated version entitled A Design for Leadership Development in Scouting. Responding to widespread interest, Dr. Tripp gave a talk in 1963 at the Fifty-third Annual Meeting of the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America on Development of Leadership in Boy Leaders of Boys. In August 1963, a patrol of Scouts from the San Mateo County Council and a few boys from the Circle Ten Council in Dallas attended White Stag summer camp at Camp Pico Blanco. The program was observed and evaluated by Ken Wells (national director of Research) and John Larson (staff researcher). Wells {{had a long history}} with Wood Badge, beginning as a participant in the second United States Wood Badge course in 1948. They were impressed by the program.|$|E
5000|$|Subliminal {{psychological}} {{influence is}} also referenced frequently by the British mentalist Derren Brown who claims its use as the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> effects.

50|$|The Differend is {{considered}} Lyotard's most important work, {{and has been}} seen as providing the theoretical <b>basis</b> for much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> later work.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{he was a}} child, Woodring has {{experienced}} hallucinatory [...] "apparitions", which have inspired much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> surreal work. He keeps an [...] "autojournal" [...] <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dreams, some <b>of</b> which have formed the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> comics. His most famous creation is fictional—the pantomime comics set in the universe he calls the Unifactor, usually featuring Frank. These stories incorporate a highly personal symbolism largely inspired by Woodrings belief in Vedanta from Hindu philosophy. He also does {{a large amount of}} surrealist painting, and has been the writer on a number of comics from licensed franchises published by Dark Horse and others.|$|R
5|$|East Carolina {{running back}} Chris Johnson {{finished}} {{the game with}} 223rushing yards, 32receiving yards, and 153return yards {{for a total of}} 408all-purpose yards. That mark broke the NCAA bowl record for all-purpose yards previously set by Alabama's Sherman Williams against Ohio State in the 1995 Citrus Bowl. On the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> record-setting performance, Johnson was named the game's Most Valuable Player. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, Boise State tailback Jeremy Avery had a solid, if unspectacular, outing. He produced 69rushing yards, 43receiving yards, 41kick–return yards, and caught a 25–yard touchdown pass. Both Johnson and Avery received the Most Valuable Player award for their respective teams.|$|E
5|$|Epic {{poetry is}} a genre of poetry, {{and a major}} form of {{narrative}} literature. This genre is often defined as lengthy poems concerning events of a heroic or important nature {{to the culture of}} the time. It recounts, in a continuous narrative, the life and works of a heroic or mythological person or group of persons. Examples of epic poems are Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, the Nibelungenlied, Luís de Camões' Os Lusíadas, the Cantar de Mio Cid, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Mahabharata, Valmiki's Ramayana, Ferdowsi's Shahnama, Nizami (or Nezami)'s Khamse (Five Books), and the Epic of King Gesar. While the composition of epic poetry, and of long poems generally, became less common in the west after the early 20th century, some notable epics have continued to be written. Derek Walcott won a Nobel prize to a great extent on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> epic, Omeros.|$|E
5|$|Ernst {{had been}} a canon at Cologne since 1570. He {{had the support of}} the {{neighboring}} Duke of Jülich and several allies within the Cathedral Chapter. Although supported by both the papacy and his influential father, a 1571 effort to secure for him the office of coadjutor of the electorate of Cologne had failed once Salentin had agreed to abide by the Trentine proceedings; as the coadjutor bishop, Ernst would have been well-positioned to present himself as Salentin's logical successor. Since then, however, he had advanced in other sees, becoming bishop of Liège, Freising and Hildesheim, important strongholds of Counter-Reformation Catholicism. He was a career cleric, not necessarily qualified to be an archbishop on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> theological erudition, but by his family connections. His membership in several chapters extended the family influence, and his status as a prebendary gave him a portion of revenues from several cathedrals. He had been educated by Jesuits and the papacy considered collaboration with his family as a means to limit the spread of Lutheranism and Calvinism in the northern provinces.|$|E
50|$|When demobbed, Geoffrey was {{determined}} not to return home without first obtaining a job. He went to his local rep, the Little Theatre in Nottingham (later to become the Nottingham Playhouse) and became a Scenic Painter. He had no prior experience of scenic painting but was hired on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> photographs <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work. While employed there he would have to paint up to three different sets every Sunday. Similar work followed at various other rep theatres including the Liverpool Playhouse and Royal Hippodrome Theatre in Eastbourne.|$|R
40|$|It {{should be}} of interest, whether Dirac's {{equation}} involves all 16 <b>basis</b> elements <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Clifford algebra Cl_D. These include the 6 `tensorial' σ^μν with which the `Pauli terms' are formed. We find that these violate a basic axiom of any *-algebra, when Dirac's Ψ is canonical. Then the Dirac operator is spanned only by the 10 elements 1,iγ_ 5,γ^μ,γ^μγ_ 5 (which don't form a <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Cl_D because the σ^μν are excluded) ...|$|R
2500|$|James Butler Hickok (May 27, 1837 – August 2, 1876), {{better known}} as [...] "Wild Bill" [...] Hickok, was a folk hero of the American Old West known for his work across the {{frontier}} as a drover, wagon master, soldier, spy, scout, lawman, gunfighter, gambler, showman, and actor. He earned a great deal <b>of</b> notoriety in <b>his</b> own time, much of it bolstered by the many outlandish and often fabricated tales that he told about his life. Some contemporaneous reports <b>of</b> <b>his</b> exploits {{are known to be}} fictitious, but they remain the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fame and reputation, along with his own stories.|$|R
