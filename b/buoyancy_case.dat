30|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} thermal dispersion on non-Newtonian power-law nanofluid flow over an impermeable vertical plate. We use a mathematical model for the nanofluid that incorporates the effects of nanoparticle Brownian motion and thermophoresis. The non-Newtonian nature of the fluid is modeled by the power-law index n, and both cases of shear thinning and thickening are investigated. The governing set of equations is solved numerically using the shooting technique. The effects of physical and fluid parameters on the properties are determined for both instances of aiding and opposing buoyancy force. We show, inter alia, that for fixed thermal dispersion coefficient values, the fluid temperature within the boundary layer decreases as the power-law index increases for both aiding and opposing <b>buoyancy</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss two issues, the {{inter-comparison}} of four mixed layer mesoscale parameterizations {{and the search for}} the eddy induced velocity for an arbitrary tracer. It must be stressed that our analysis is limited to mixed layer mesoscales since we do not treat sub-mesoscales and small turbulent mixing. As for the first item, since three of the four parameterizations are expressed in terms of a stream function and a residual flux of the RMT formalism (residual mean theory), while the fourth is expressed in terms of vertical and horizontal fluxes, we needed a formalism to connect the two formulations. The standard RMT representation developed for the deep ocean cannot be extended to the mixed layer since its stream function does not vanish at the ocean's surface. We develop a new RMT representation that satisfies the surface boundary condition. As for the general form of the eddy induced velocity for an arbitrary tracer, thus far, it has been assumed that there is only the one that originates from the curl of the stream function. This is because it was assumed that the tracer residual flux is purely diffusive. On the other hand, we show {{that in the case of}} an arbitrary tracer, the residual flux has also a skew component that gives rise to an additional bolus velocity. Therefore, instead of only one bolus velocity, there are now two, one coming from the curl of the stream function and other from the skew part of the residual flux. In the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>case,</b> only one bolus velocity contributes to the mean buoyancy equation since the residual flux is indeed only diffusive...|$|E
30|$|The {{variation}} in velocity, temperature and nanoparticle volume fraction with the power-law index, Brownian motion and thermophoresis parameters {{is shown in}} Figures  4 - 6. We observe that both the Brownian motion and the thermophoresis parameters increase the fluid velocity and the temperature for both pseudoplastics and dilatants. The nanoparticle Brownian motion enhances thermal conduction via direct heat transport or micro-convection of fluid surrounding individual nanoparticles. For very small solid particles, the Brownian motion is strong. Following earlier studies by Buongiorno [14], Nield and Kuznetsov [5] and others, the thermophoresis parameter values have been selected to simulate realistic applications in heat exchangers, chemical engineering, porous media flows, etc. For particular values of Brownian motion and thermophoresis parameters, {{an increase in the}} velocity boundary layer was observed for both aiding and opposing <b>buoyancy</b> <b>cases.</b> The temperature and nanoparticle volume boundary layer thicknesses decrease as the power-law index increases. The effect of Brownian motion and thermophoresis parameters on the nanoparticle volume fraction profile is exactly opposite to the temperature profile. Here we observe that the change in nanoparticle volume fraction profiles is less in the case of dilatant fluids compared to pseudoplastics.|$|R

A parametric study of the physical parameters involved in the problem is conducted and a representative set of numerical results is illustrated, with accent on the comparison between linear and non-linear stratification. It is significant to notice that the separation of flow is found to be more in the absence of stratification whereas it is less in the presence of stratification.

An isothermal boundary condition is applied for both boundaries, and the buoyancy factor throughout the fluid layer is chosen to be a function of depth. For various profiles of variable buoyancy factor, the associated eigenvalue problem for the linear regime is solved numerically using a spectral method.

40|$|Ventilation stacks are {{becoming}} increasingly common {{in the design of}} naturally ventilated buildings. The overall aim of the work described is ultimately to improve design procedures for such buildings. This thesis presents the experimental and theoretical investigation of unsteady wind effects on natural ventilation of a single envelope with multiple openings for both wind alone, and wind and <b>buoyancy</b> combined <b>cases.</b> There are two types of openings: namely the sharp-edged orifice and the long opening (stacks being treated as long openings). Two methods are adopted: 1) direct wind tunnel measurements using the hot-wire technique; 2) theoretical analysis using steady and unsteady envelope flow models. For the wind alone experiments, the influences of wind speed, wind direction and opening configuration on flow patterns are studied. For the wind and buoyancy combined tests, the transitional process between wind dominated and buoyancy dominated states are investigated. The direct velocity measurements provide the criteria for testing the validity of the theoretical models, and ways to improve them. Additionally, improvements are made to the experimental techniques: e. g. a precise unsteady calibration method of the hot-wire is developed; improvements of pressure measurements are also investigated. The experimental technique works well with multiple stacks. Even though small openings are used, some dependence of the mean pressure coefficient on opening configuration is observed. The theoretical models also work reasonably well with multiple stacks, yet it is observed that the accuracy of the theoretical models decrease with the increasing number of openings, and is sensitive to the chosen discharge coefficient which defines the characteristics of ventilation openings.

40|$|AbstractWe {{experimentally}} {{investigated the}} effect of capillarity and buoyancy on non-wetting phase (NWP) saturation after the drainage. Distributions of the NWP in porous media have been visualized by mean of microtomograhy at a pore- scale. Viscous fingering is caused on the interface when less viscous NWP is displacing viscous WP. In {{the case of the}} upward injection, gas saturation is low compared with the upward case, because the fingering is enhanced by <b>buoyancy.</b> In the <b>case</b> of the downward injection, the fingering due to unfavourable viscosity ratio is suppressed by buoyancy. As a result, the high gas saturation is achieved over the wide range of capillary number. The combined dimensionless group of Bond number and capillary number is introduced to correlate with the gas saturation. Finally, {{the effect of}} heterogeneity on gas saturation after drainage process was discussed. In the case of parallel structure, the NWP flows through layers with high permeability and with low entrance pressure especially for low capillary numbers. Therefore gas saturation is quite low both for upward and downward injections. In the case of serial structure, capillary entrance pressure caused at the interface of discontinuity of pore structure has a strong influence to increase NWP saturation in porous structure before the interface...|$|R

40|$|Personal {{floatation}} devices (PFDs) {{save lives}} in the fishing industry. Most work-related fatalities in the fishing industry are caused by drowning after a vessel disaster or a fall overboard. Although the risk of drowning is high, most deckhands do not wear PFDs while working on the deck. There are currently no mandates by regulatory agencies for these workers to wear PFDs. Past research conducted by NIOSH examined the predictors of PFD use in the fishing industry in Alaska. Workers who believed that PFDs are an entanglement hazard had low PFD use, as did workers who believed that PFDs interfere with work. Workers may wear PFDs more often if they are familiar with newer models that have features which alleviate their concerns regarding comfort. The NIOSH Alaska Pacific Office conducted a study to determine which type of commercially available PFD resulted in the highest satisfaction in actual fishing industry working conditions. Different vessels have unique on-deck work processes, thus four vessel types were targeted: crabbers (vessels dropping baited pots to catch crab {{on the ocean floor}}), longliners (vessels anchoring strings of baited hooks on the ocean floor to catch a variety of bottom fish), gillnetters (vessels towing gillnets to catch primarily salmon), and trawlers (vessels towing large trawl nets to catch groundfish and pelagic fish). Six PFD models were selected to provide a variety of features to test for comfort and functionality. The study revealed that workers on different types of fishing vessels had varying preferences for PFDs. Because no regulations mandating the use of PFDs exist, manufacturers may have more success in supplying PFDs if they engage workers in the design and promotion of newer, more comfortable PFDs. Impact Based on the results of the NIOSH PFD study, a national PFD manufacturer realized there was a need for innovative PFD designs to improve comfort for workers in the fishing industry. They extended the NIOSH study and took a variety of commercially available PFDs to test on several boats where crewmembers gave feedback on the mobility of each PFD. Based on their market research, the company developed a prototype designed to be worn under bibs and raingear with 12 lbs. of flotation, the optimal amount to maintain a low profile while still maintaining buoyancy. This new vest could be worn continuously, even when going ashore, but would still allow <b>buoyancy</b> in <b>case</b> of a fall overboard. This prototype was field-tested for continuous wear and a number of adjustments were made based on fishermen's feedback, including shortening the overall height of the vest and adding indentations on the sides for flexibility when sitting and stepping up, increasing the diameter of the armholes to increase range of motion, lowering the neck to aid in looking downward, and adding reflective loops where gear could be secured to replace pockets that would catch on equipment.

40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{the present}} work is to assess the ability of Eulerian moment methods to {{reproduce}} the physics of two-way coupled particle-laden turbulent flow systems. Previous investigations have been focused on effects such as preferential concentration, and turbulence modulation, but in regimes in which turbulence is sustained by an imposed external forcing. We show that in such regimes, Eulerian methods need resolutions finer than nominal Kolmogorov scale in order to capture statistics of particle segregation, but gas and disperse phase velocity variances can be captured with resolutions comparable to the Kolmogorov length. The work is then extended {{to address the question}} whether Eulerian methods are suitable in scenarios in which the continuum field of interest (temperature or momentum) is itself primarily driven by particles. To this end we have extended our analysis to the problem of turbulence driven by heated particles (Zamansky et al. PoF 2014) and have assessed capabilities of Eulerian methods in capturing particle segregation, as well as statistics of the temperature and velocity fields. Separate investigations are developed for cases with and without buoyancy driven turbulence. For each case corresponding Lagrangian calculations are developed and convergence of statistics with respect to the number of particles is established. Then the statistically-converged Lagrangian and Eulerian results are compared. Results show that accurate capture of segregation by the Eulerian methods always requires resolutions much higher than the nominal Kolmogorov scale. In scenarios for which a continuum phase is forced by particles, results from Eulerian methods show some sensitivity of predicted continuum statistics to the mesh resolution. This sensitivity was found to be largest for the case of a temperature field forced by hot particles, but without presence of <b>buoyancy.</b> In this <b>case</b> a Eulerian method with nominal Kolmogorov resolution was found to be insufficient for capture of temperature statistics. When additional coupling between particles and continuum phase is introduced by including the buoyancy effects, this sensitivity is suppressed in the temperature field, but some sensitivity to the Eulerian mesh resolution were detected in the momentum fields...|$|R
40|$|A free- falling {{lifeboat}} is a {{last resort}} evacuation system, installed on many rigid and floating offshore structures. The diving process of a free-falling lifeboat is a complex matter, as the external forces varies through the process. The diving process is essentially divided into six different phases. These are the launching phase, free-falling phase, water entry phase, submerged phase, water exit phase and the sail away phase. The launching and free-falling phase determines the initial conditions {{at the point of}} impact, typically this will be impact velocity, water entry angle and angular rotations. As the body enters the water, it will be subjected to slamming forces. The pitch motion initially turns from clockwise to counter clockwise rotation, leading to larger slamming forces on the aft part. Eventually the aft part crosses the water surface and there will be an air cavity formation. The gravity will press the two newly formed free surfaces together and the unavoidable collapse leads to a large pressure on the body, in its direction of motion. This is due to the pressure from the water on the newly formed air bubble, entrapped on the very aft part. The body reaches its maximum submergence and then it starts the ascent phase, driven by the <b>buoyancy.</b> In the <b>case</b> of a positive surge motion and a counter clockwise rotation, the body will get this additional contribution in the ascent. The body eventually exits the water, where it gets a certain pop-up height, this height depends on the exit velocity and angle. As the body re-enters the water surface it can be subjected to a second slamming, and its magnitude is dependent on the pop-up height and the rotation after the water exit. It is favourable that the body sail as far as possible away from the evacuation scene. And this distance is dependent on the other phases. A simplified free-falling lifeboat geometry were chosen for the simulations. The body is a semi-ellipsoid with length 10 m, and largest diameter 3 m. The simulations are run in the commercial software Star-CCM+. The simulations are computational expensive, and most of the simulations has been simulated on the high-performance computer, Vilje. A convergence check was preformed to investigate the quality of the solution and a suitable mesh size has been chosen with respect to satisfactory global behaviour and computational time. A simulation has been preformed in calm water conditions. The result and behaviour of the body is reasonable compared to theory. The body is subjected to large deaccelerations and counter clockwise pitch accelerations in the water entry phase. The formation of an air cavity and its collapse is clearly visual in VOF-scenes and as a large peak in the body-fixed acceleration plot. The body exits bow first, gets some air time, and is subjected to a small second slamming as it re-enters the water surface. A parameter investigation has been preformed where the impact velocity, water entry angle and centre of gravity in z-direction has been changed with ± 5 m/s, ± 5 ° and ± 0. 2 m, repectivly. The results showed that changing the velocity gave largest effect in the behaviour of the body, but the highest water entry angle gave the largest submergence which is an important parameter as it gives the highest hydrostatical pressure. Changing the centre of gravity showed to have relative small effects. The lifeboat will most likely be used in a storm-conditions. Eighteen different cases has been simulated, with four different wave phases in three different headings. Three of these has been tested for two additional steepnesses. The waves are modelled as regular linear waves. The results shows that the behaviour of the body is greatly affected when waves are included in the simulation. The wave forces contribute in form of Froude-Krylov forces, diffraction forces and additional drag forces. Some of the largest accelerations in the water entry phase are found when the body dives in the wave phase where the fluid velocity is acting upwards. Large accelerations in the water entry phase are also observed when the fluid velocity is acting in the same global x- direction as the body. This creates a large counter clockwise pitch velocity which increases the slamming load on the aft part. The second slamming is dependent on the water exit, where the exit velocity, water exit angle, wave phase and heading are decisive. The effect of decreasing the steepness was in general smaller accelerations in the water entry phase. The particle velocities are reduced as they are proportional to the wave amplitude. However, the second slamming is dependent on the water exit and the body rotation, and the CAR values shows that there can be large stresses on the passengers also in the case of small steepnesses. Uncertainties connected with the simulations are the segregated flow and its weakness in term of predicting impulse forces like slamming, and how this manifests further in the solution. There has also been detected some unreal large velocities at the aft corner, leading to uncertainties on how these will affect the solution. Some errors in the interpolation between the cells in the overset mesh will be present as the overset mesh does not have a uniform cell size...|$|R
