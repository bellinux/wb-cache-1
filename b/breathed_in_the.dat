5|$|NASA astronauts train {{underwater}} {{to simulate}} the weightlessness and occasionally need to fly afterwards at cabin altitudes not exceeding 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Training dives use 46% Nitrox and can exceed six hours at a maximum depth of 40ffw (12mfw) for a maximum equivalent air depth (EAD) of 24fsw (7 msw). NASA guidelines for EADs of 20–50fsw (6–15msw) with maximum dive durations of 100–400 minutes allow either air or oxygen to be <b>breathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preflight surface intervals. Oxygen breathing during surface intervals reduces the time to fly {{by a factor of}} seven to nine times compared with air. A study by another military organization, the Special Operations Command also indicated that preflight oxygen might be an effective means for reducing DCS risk.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} bathing procedure {{consisted of}} merely reclining in natural pools of hot springs and cool creek water {{for long periods}} of time. [...] During the 1820s crude vapor baths stood over the springs, and bathers <b>breathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vapors for extended periods of time. [...] Wooden tubs were added to some bathhouses in the 1830s. [...] Physicians began arriving in the 1850s, although many visitors did without their services; visitors remained from one week to two months. [...] After the Civil War a tub bath of 15 to 20 minutes was common.|$|E

2500|$|The term spirit means [...] "animating or vital {{principle}} in man and animals".

60|$|When I got to {{the bench}} that {{afternoon}} I was tired. There was a big crowd to see the game; the weather was perfect; Milly sat up in the box and waved her score card at me; Raddy and Spears declared we had the game; the Rube stalked to and fro like an implacable Indian chief--but I was not happy in mind.
