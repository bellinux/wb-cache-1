25|$|A <b>bifold</b> <b>door</b> is a {{unit that}} has several sections, folding in pairs. Wood {{is the most common}} material, and doors may also be metal or glass. Bifolds are most {{commonly}} made for closets, but may also be used as units between rooms. Bi-fold doors are essentially now doors that let the outside in. They open in concert; where the panels fold up against one another and are pushed together when opened. The main door panel (often known as the traffic door) is accompanied by a stack of panels that fold very neatly against one another when opened fully, which almost look like room dividers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{phone booth}} {{is located on}} the east side of Prairie Grove, {{opposite}} the entrance to Prairie Grove Battlefield State Park on U.S. Highway 62, and in front of the Colonial Motel. It is a structure built out of aluminum with a satin finish, and glass window walls, with a <b>bifold</b> <b>door</b> that folds inward, topped by a red panel marked [...] "TELEPHONE". It rests on a small concrete pad, with the door facing the highway, and measures about 86.125 in in height, and 33.5 in in width and depth at its base. It is slightly larger at the top, with an aluminum roof that projects slightly beyond the walls. The interior of the booth houses an aluminum shelf, above which the original telephone is mounted. A swiveling directory holder is mounted in the shelf, and there is a fluorescent light fixture mounted in the ceiling.|$|E
40|$|A {{program of}} {{experimental}} fires {{has been carried}} out to assess fire containment and other fire hazards in lavatory and cargo compartments of wide-body jet aircraft by evaluation of ignition time, burn-through time, fire spread rate, smoke density, evolution of selected combustible and toxic gases, heat flux, and detector response. Two tests were conducted: one involving a standard Boeing 747 lavatory and one involving a simulated DC- 10 cargo compartment. A production lavatory module was furnished with conventional materials and was installed in an enclosure. The ignition load was four polyethylene bags containing paper and plastic waste materials representive of a maximum flight cabin waste load. Standard aircraft ventilation conditions were utilized and the lavatory door was closed during the test. Lavatory wall and ceiling panels contained the fire spread during the 30 -minute test. Smoke was driven into the enclosure primarily through the ventilation grille in the door and through the gaps between the <b>bifold</b> <b>door</b> and the jamb where the door distorted from the heat earlier in the test. The interior of the lavatory was almost completely destroyed by the fire...|$|E
5000|$|Although the Shutter House {{is not a}} LEED {{certified}} building, many sustainable {{features are}} incorporated into the design. The most sustainable element is manifested in the architect’s design thesis of opening traditional Manhattan living space to the surrounding city. The perforated metal shutters, controlled by the tenant to allow or block daylight in each double height space, along with the glass garage-like <b>bifold</b> <b>doors,</b> are designated green features. The <b>bifold</b> <b>doors,</b> located on the southern façade, not only open the apartment to surrounding views, but also blur the boundary between interior and exterior to allow for natural air ventilation. Open facades on both {{the north and south}} sides of the Shutter House allow for daylight to be maximized in each apartment. The architectural and mechanical process of opening up to or closing off from fluctuating environmental conditions results in energy efficiency for each apartment.|$|R
50|$|Sitting on a plinth of blue bricks, the {{building}} is symmetrical about a parapeted projecting breakfront. The breakfront has two wide doorways with <b>bifold</b> <b>doors</b> for vehicle access at ground level and two large recessed arched windows at the upper level. The <b>bifold</b> <b>doors</b> to the right hand side doorway have been replaced with aluminium framed glass sliding doors. Prominent cream rendered banding wraps {{the building}} and gives emphasis to the corners and the breakfront. The double doorway main entrance is defined by a plain projecting cornice sitting on three heavy brackets. Plain rendered arches with prominent keystones frame the central upper level windows. The letters QATB sit {{at the top of}} the parapet below an entablature composed of a plain cornice and chunky dentils. The spandrels below the arched windows contain the words Wynnum Centre. The breakfront is flanked by bays framed by pilasters. At ground level each bay has a single doorway defined by a small plain projecting canopy. The building is crowned by a gambrel tiled roof. A flagpole rises above the parapet.|$|R
50|$|The one-story, {{rectangular}} {{house is}} more substantial than many a bungalow, {{with a large}} living room with Chinese-style lights, three bedrooms separated by both screen and solid doors, and a hall leading {{to the kitchen and}} pantry. It also has a central vacuum system and a basement. The fine craftsmanship can be seen in its parquet floors, built-in furniture, and stained-glass windows. The lava rock used for the foundation, support piers, and texture in the stucco also show commitment to the use of local materials. However, the leaded glass for the windows and the glazed brick for the fireplace both came from Australia, and the beveled glass in the <b>bifold</b> <b>doors</b> to the lānais came from France.|$|R
50|$|The {{asymmetrical}} south elevation contains three bays of casement {{windows and}} a loggia to the ground floor and a verandah enclosed with casement and louvre windows to the upper level. The lintels of the windows are picked out in cream. The pillared loggia is reached by a flight of wide concrete steps from the garden and forms the main entrance to {{the south side of}} the upper level. The north elevation has a plain porch entrance approximately half way along the building. The porch has been enclosed with sheeting and louvres. The bays of windows to the north and west at the northwest corner are sheltered by plain timber framed hoods. The rear elevation contains a set of central <b>bifold</b> <b>doors</b> to the ground floor and a flight of timber stairs rises to a timber landing accessing the rear of the upper level.|$|R
50|$|A common story {{regarding}} the tragedy {{states that the}} doors {{at the bottom of}} the Italian Hall's stairs opened inward. According to the story, when the fleeing party goers reached the bottom of the stairs, they pressed up against the doors, preventing them from opening and causing many people to be crushed. All photos of the doors suggest a double set of doors with both sets opening outward. The book Death's Door: The Truth Behind Michigan's Largest Mass Murder pointed out that the doors were not mentioned as a contributing factor at the December 1913 coroner's inquest, the 1914 subcommittee hearing, or in any of the newspaper stories of the time. That book also included blueprints of the building drawn by an architect, showing the locations and configurations of the doors, the staircase, and the landings. A recent book by Alison K. Hoagland, Mine Towns (declared to be a Michigan Notable Book 2010), alleges there were two sets of doors opening onto a vestibule, and that the outer doors opened outward; and there may have been a set of inner <b>bifold</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{northern}} {{rear side}} of Lochiel {{consists of the}} enclosed courtyard flanked by the two-storeyed rear wing to the east, and the [...] "museum" [...] wing to the west. The enclosed courtyard has a corrugated iron skillion roof supported by timber posts, with louvred glass panels and compressed sheeting forming the exterior wall. A recessed entrance is located centrally, with multi-paned <b>bifolding</b> timber <b>doors.</b> A rendered masonry chimney {{is located at the}} rear of the original section of the building adjacent to the enclosed courtyard.|$|R
50|$|The {{elevation}} to Cedar Street is less grand {{than the}} main elevation to Tingal Road. As the residential {{entrance to the}} superintendent's living quarters it is of a domestic scale appropriate to the streetscape. Corner pilasters emphasised by vertical rendered banding define the brick portion of this elevation. A timber framed annexe attaches to the right hand side and is clad with weatherboards. An external concrete stair, parallel to the elevation, arrives at the central entrance to the living quarters on the upper level. This entrance has a <b>bifold</b> timber <b>door</b> and {{is marked by a}} small bracketed overhang.|$|R
50|$|Rectangular in plan, {{the ground}} floor {{contains}} an engine room, watchroom, dormitory, kitchen, bathroom and recreation room. Tall, vertical, timber, <b>bifold,</b> counterweighted <b>doors</b> to School Road open into the engine room around which the other rooms are arranged in an L-shape. The concrete floor to the engine room has been painted green but the red fire engine guide tracks are evident {{in areas where the}} paint has worn. The watchroom is {{at the front of the}} Station off the engine room and opens into the adjacent dormitory. The fireman's pole terminated in a small hall in the centre of the building to the rear of the engine room. The pole has been removed. The kitchen, bathroom and dormitory open off this hall. The recreation room is to the rear of the Station off the engine room and opening to the rear yard. All ground floor rooms are lined with tongue and groove boarding and have fibro sheeted battened ceilings. The dormitory contains built-in timber cupboards and tilting fanlights to the engine room wall. The bathroom could not be unlocked but a terrazzo floor was evident under the closed door. A serving hatch has been cut into the wall between the kitchen and the recreation room.|$|R
