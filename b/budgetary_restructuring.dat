At the State’s level in Romania, the reform of public spending that focuses primarily on supporting the economical convergence and improving the capacity to absorb EU funds, through <b>restructuring</b> <b>budgetary</b> expenditures, has started. I have identified in this paper four measures which {{may contribute to the}} improvement of the public spending efficiency. These measures regard decentralization, public acquisitions, the state control function, the budgeting procedure. efficiency, public sector, decentralization, program based budget, performance based budget...|$|R
50|$|The New England Immortals RLFC {{were founded}} in 2010 and {{consisted}} of the top players from the 3 New England based AMNRL clubs.They played their inaugural match against the Canadian National Team, on July 31, 2010, defeating the Canadians 12-8 in a tightly contested match. After the AMNRL/USARL split in 2011, the Immortals were transferred to the USARL and became the only form of representation for USARL clubs due to the RLIF regulation that USARL-based players could not represent the Tomahawks. The Immortals took to the field for their second match since their inception, and despite putting up a hard fight, they were out classed by the more experienced Marines, losing by a score of 68-12. As of 2014, due to <b>budgetary</b> cuts and <b>restructuring</b> of the USARL competition, the Immortals have not played a match since their loss to the Royal Marines.|$|R
40|$|The Human Development Report (HDR) {{was first}} {{launched}} in 1990 {{with the single}} goal of putting people back {{at the center of}} the development process in terms of economic debate, policy and advocacy. The goal was both massive and simple, with far-ranging implications — going beyond income to assess the level of people’s long-term well-being. Bringing about development of the people, by the people, and for the people, and emphasizing that the goals of development are choices and freedoms. The Report addresses, as its main issue, the question of how economic growth translates - or fails to translate - into human development. The focus is on people and on how development enlarges their choices. The Report discusses the meaning and measurement of human development, proposing a new composite index. But its overall orientation is practical and pragmatic. It summarizes the record of human development over the past three decades, and it analyses the experience of 14 countries in managing economic growth in the interest of the broadest possible number of people. With this as its foundation, the Report then sets forth strategies for human development in the 1990 s, emphasizing the importance of <b>restructuring</b> <b>budgetary</b> expenditures, including military expenditures, and creating an international economic and financial environment conducive to human development. human development, international development, measurement...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{share of}} healthcare-related {{expenditure}} in the Gross Domestic Product of Kazakhstan is relatively small, {{and it is}} strategically important to <b>restructure</b> <b>budgetary</b> expenses in favor of healthcare with simultaneous redistribution of resources in accordance with changing demands and prioritization of high-quality medical care. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze resource provision to healthcare organizations in Kazakhstan and its structure and level assessment. Materials and Methods: The study is based on a comparative assessment of technical and technological equipment of medical institutions in Almaty, Kazakhstan. We analyzed the scope and structure of the financial component of the resource base in Almaty. We carried out information processing and analysis methods, content analysis, mathematical treatment, as well as conducted case studies. Also, we held opinion poll among medical staff (specialists, managerial staff) (n = 300) P for trend < 0. 001 and patients (n = 210) P for trend < 0. 001. Results: About 18. 8 % of patients do not receive medical care because of defects of the equipment, whereas 19. 9 % of patients claim that the reason of refusal of the provision of medical services is an equipment overload. Conclusion: Most of the respondents referred to on poor technical equipment, mismatch with the world standards of performance and competitiveness. Lack of advanced medical technology, inadequate financing, insufficient supply of domestic medical equipment, and inadequate procurement by tender were also noted. The obtained data point to the need for optimization and upgrading medical equipment at various levels of healthcare...|$|R
40|$|The fifth Cohesion Report {{highlighted}} the strategic {{perspective of the}} new cohesion policy, expressed by the „added territorial cohesion to the twin goals {{of economic and social}} cohesion”. The expected contribution of the cohesion policy is strongly linked to overcoming the crisis, reducing disparities and reaching the ambitious objectives of Europe 2020 Strategy. Unemployment represents the reverse of the medal, a concept and a measure at the intersection of many dimensions, complex and with a large spectrum of interpretations. The spatial dimension of the unemployment was relatively recently addressed by new regional theories, which focused on its: geographical/spatial concentration [Alonso-Villar O. and Del R o C (2008) ], agglomeration, returns and spatial unemployment disparities [Suedekum J. (2004) ] with aspects of dynamic [Martin R. (1997) ], persistence, factors, regional policy rethinking [Chisholm M. (1976) ], convergence/divergence of regional disparities [Marshall (1920), Krugman (1991) and Krugman/Venables (1995)), etc]. Overman and Puga (2002) bring empirical evidences regarding the spatial effects of „Unemployment clusters across European regions and countries”. Following Niebuhr idea, by measuring the spatial autocorrelation, „regions marked by high unemployment as well as areas characterised by low unemployment tend to cluster in space”(Niebuhr, 2005). Therefore, we analysed the case of intra-regional unemployment disparities at the region level (NUTS 2 level - for the case of South Muntenia Region), by using the finest possible disaggregated level for data - the localities. The interest to measure the intraregional unemployment clusters is based on (Goschin, Roman, Ileanu, 2008) the characteristic of the current state and dynamics of regional disparities in Romania descried as “low amplitude of both interregional and intra-regional disparities”, with the distinction that, “intra-regional disparities are much higher than the inter-regional disparities. ”Next to agglomeration and persistence of unemployment in some specific areas, the crisis period and its persistence during the period 2009 - 2010, emphasized the European tendency of increasing „regional disparities” [...] In order to better respond to the crisis` pressure, Romania, started in 2010 a massive process of <b>budgetary</b> sector <b>restructuring,</b> folowed by important exits from employment to unemployment. The significant number of persons without a job suddenly increased the pressure over the labour market insitutionsand diminished the dynamics of the labour market (induced by the limited occupational mobility) acting as a shock (intense and/or long time pressure probability) and being very difficult to be compensated in time by policies. The variables are built with one set of reference data and one set of working data, all for the characteristics: age between 18 - 62 years (total, feminin and masculin (calculated). The reference data was provided by The National Institute of Statistics (INS) demographic data, respectively the stable population registered at the level of a locality, considered to be constant during the analysed period. The working data was obtained from ANOFM/AJOFM (National Employment Agency) and covers 567 localities out {{of the total number of}} 2121 localities from South Muntenia Region, including the number of registered unemployed people under the administrative definiton (unemployed people with indemnisation and without indemnisation), for the characteristic total, female and male (calculated). The secondary working data set is represented by the share of unemployed people as a proxy for the unemployment rate. Using administrative data implies bothdisadvantages and advantages. Some limits of this method induced by the indicators source are:reduced comparability, national unemployment definition, the statistical quality of data, the interval 18 - 62 years represents the functional age for entrance and exist in and out of the labour market in Romania. We consider very important to emphasis the advantages of this approach, especially in the context of the cohesion policy future development. Thus, the advantages refer to: data is public, covers the finest regional level (localities, over LAU / 2, 3174), is available with the best frequency among the labour market indicators - monthly frequency, are the main indicators used in the labour protection policy implementation, etc. Another very important advantage is the perspective of using the flux data (entrance and exits in unemployment at the localities level) next to the stock data we used in our model. We used the Anselin method, 2005 / Varga, 2009, to analyze the Local Spatial Autocorrelations characteristics, to identify the clusters HH, LL with different significance level, for the unemployment and the share of unemployment in the stable population for the mentioned characteristics (total, feminine, masculine, age 18 - 62 years, at locality level), for December 2009 compared to March 2010, at locality level using Arc GIS 9. 3. (Arc GIS Catalog and Arc MAP) Spatial econometrics through the GeoDa software was applied under the hypothesis that localities represent the centres of the Thiessen polygons, using rook contiguity weight file. Results are presented through maps and tables indicated the localities situated in the HH and LL clusters...|$|R
