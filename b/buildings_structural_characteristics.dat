40|$|The 9 / 11 {{terrorist}} attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center were one of the saddest events in history which resulted in a tragic loss of life. An understanding of the structural response of the North Tower (WTC 1) to the fire following the aircraft impact and the collapse sequence is necessary, so that similar attacks on high-rise buildings can be resisted with limited casualties and minimal structural damage. To this end, the effect of elevated temperature on the behavior of structural steel members was studied. The reduction of material properties, such as the yield stress and Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus of elasticity with temperature was discussed. Experimental data from fire tests on structural steel members were presented and conclusions about the deflection characteristics, the critical temperature, the failure mode and the effect of important parameters, such as the loading level, the axial and rotational restraint, were drawn. Once the interaction between fire and steel members was studied, the thermal environment of North Tower was discussed. The structural system of the building was then analyzed in the discussed environment while taking into account the materials, the unique <b>building</b> <b>structural</b> <b>characteristics,</b> and the evidence (observed and inferred) of the initial damage of the impacted zone. Credible failure mechanisms for the North Tower structure were then identified and the dominant factors affecting them were established. The failure mechanism that most likely triggered the collapse initiation was identified. ...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{presents}} {{a complete and}} commented collection of cases of damage and collapse in reinforced concrete (RC) precast industrial buildings, observed by the authors during a series of field surveys after the 2012 Emilia earthquake in Northern Italy. They were selected among {{a total of about}} 2000 industrial RC precast <b>buildings,</b> whose <b>structural</b> <b>characteristics</b> and damage have been collected in a large database by the authors. The main causes of the collapses were vulnerabilities related to the <b>structural</b> <b>characteristics</b> of Italian precast buildings not designed with seismic criteria. In particular, these structures were typically built as an assembly of monolithic elements (roof elements, main and secondary beams, columns) in statically determinate configurations. The most common failure causes identified were: the absence of mechanical connectors between precast monolithic elements, the interaction of structural elements with non-structural walls, the insufficient column bending capacity, the rotation of pocket foundations, the inadequacy of connections of external precast cladding walls to bearing elements (columns and beams), the overturning of racks in buildings used as warehouses or in automated storage facilities...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePurpose and hypotheses: the {{objective}} {{of this study was to}} describe the cognitive distortions and the incidence of <b>structural</b> <b>characteristics</b> in PMU (horseracing) punters. <b>Structural</b> <b>characteristics</b> of horseracing punters were correlated with the degree of severity of gambling. Punters presented cognitive distortions that were correlated with <b>structural</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Method: horseracing punters were recruited from PMU points of sale, Parisian region racetracks and public places. They were evaluated by using the South Oaks gambling screen (SOGS), the Gambling related cognition scale (GRCS) and a questionnaire measuring the incidence of <b>structural</b> <b>characteristics</b> among horseracing punters, corresponding to gambling-inherent properties likely to encourage punting or betting. Results: in a group of 100 horseracing punters, detected by means of the SOGS, 45 were recreational gamblers, 43 were problem gamblers and 12 were probable pathological gamblers. A positive correlation of 0. 27 was observed between SOGS and <b>structural</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Horseracing punters presented strong adhesion to "predictive control", "hope related to gambling" and "perceived inability to stop gambling" cognitive distortions, related to "gambling" and "educational" <b>characteristics.</b> Discussion: the <b>structural</b> <b>characteristics</b> of horseracing punters are relevant to the study of pathological gambling and have a probable impact on the degree of severity of gambling. Links were observed between certain <b>structural</b> <b>characteristics</b> and certain cognitive distortions in the addiction process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

40|$|Purpose of Review: There {{are many}} {{different}} factors involved in how and why people develop problems with video game playing. One such set of factors concerns the <b>structural</b> <b>characteristics</b> of video games (i. e., the structure, elements, and components of the video games themselves). Much of the research examining the <b>structural</b> <b>characteristics</b> of video games was initially based on research and theorizing from the gambling studies field. The present review briefly overviews the key papers {{in the field to}} date. Recent Findings: The paper examines a number of areas including (i) similarities in <b>structural</b> <b>characteristics</b> of gambling and video gaming, (ii) <b>structural</b> <b>characteristics</b> in video games, (iii) narrative and flow in video games, (iv) <b>structural</b> <b>characteristic</b> taxonomies for video games, and (v) video game <b>structural</b> <b>characteristics</b> and game design ethics. Many of the studies carried out to date are small-scale, and comprise self-selected convenience samples (typically using self-report surveys or non-ecologically valid laboratory experiments). Summary: Based on the small amount of empirical data, it appears that structural features that {{take a long time to}} achieve in-game are the ones most associated with problematic video game play (e. g., earning experience points, managing in-game resources, mastering the video game, getting 100...|$|R

Teacher and director pre-service education, teacher and director continuing education, teacher and director wages, provision of benefits to staff, and training budget per staff member consistently predicted quality, accounting for between 27. 4 % and 28. 9 % of the variance in ECERS Total Score. Further, this set of <b>structural</b> <b>characteristics</b> accurately predicted 52 % of "Good," "Mediocre," and "Poor" quality sites. Yet, even within this smaller set of eight structural predictors, two <b>structural</b> <b>characteristics</b> (percent of teachers in the center that have an Associate Degree or higher and the number of benefits) and their interaction most strongly accounted for variance in quality across sites and demonstrated a significant interaction effect. When applied to 38 preschools licensed by the PA Department of Education, teacher education and benefits predicted quality but to a lesser extent.
