5|$|Though Caravan had yet {{to achieve}} strong {{commercial}} success in 1970, they had started to build a live following, including an appearance at the Kralingen Pop Festival in the Netherlands {{to an audience of}} 250,000 and the 10th Plumpton Festival. In between touring, the group had written several new pieces that they wanted to record. Having had problems self-producing the previous album, If I Could Do It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You, the group decided to collaborate with producer David Hitchcock. Hitchcock had become a fan of the band and had been a key figure in getting them signed to Decca Records. He had progressed from the label's art department to production and was keen to work on the album. The group had been apprehensive about Hitchcock working on If I Could Do It All Over Again... but after discovering his enthusiasm and creative ideas, decided it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> enrol him as producer.|$|E
5|$|Anthony first appears when he poses as {{a member}} of the Walford council to help Eddie eject a {{squatter}} from a premises that they want to move their antiques business into. He then decides to remain in Walford and helps his father set up the business. Anthony buys some candlesticks from Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), though she does not know their true value, but when Cora finds out their true value, she accuses Anthony of scamming her. Eddie sells the candlesticks for £8000, and when Tyler decides to take part in an unlicensed boxing match, Michael convinces Anthony that Tyler will win and that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> place a bet on him, knowing that Anthony suffers with a gambling addiction. Anthony steals £8000 from Eddie's safe, but bets on Tyler's opponent Artie Stiller (Maurice Lee), which leaves Michael unimpressed, as he has researched Artie and found out he is tough. During the fight, however, Tyler narrowly wins so Anthony has to confess to Eddie that he has lost the money. Shortly after he does, Tyler collapses and has a seizure, so is rushed to hospital. Eddie is sickened by Anthony's actions and tells him he wishes he was dying in a hospital bed, rather than Tyler. Distraught, Anthony storms out and attends a party run by Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton), culminating in him kissing her. Afterwards, Anthony returns to the hospital to learn that Tyler has been taken for a life-saving operation and is furious that Eddie was not around. Eddie then admits that his children would be better off without him. Tyler survives and recovers, but the brothers are told by Eddie that Michael set up an unfair fight to punish the family, leading Tyler and Anthony to reject Michael. Eddie then leaves Walford, leaving Tyler and Anthony the antiques business.|$|E

25|$|By the 1966-67 season, the {{interest}} in cricket in India had risen to unprecedented levels. Despite being beaten by the West Indies at home, the Indian team's spirits were not dampened. The captain Nawab of Pataudi {{thought that it would}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> introduce more quality spinners into the team in order to compensate for the absence of good new-ball bowlers in the country. Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, the leg spinner, had already established his place in the team with solid performances against Australia and the West Indies. Erapalli Prasanna was making him comeback having been out of the team for five years, while both Venkatarghavan and Bedi played in the series against West Indies. All four of them played their first (and only game together) against England at Birmingham in the summer of 1967. Prasanna and Chandrasekhar impressed in that game, claiming 7 and 6 wickets respectively, and all four bowlers bowled a tight line. Even though these four bowlers continued to play for 11 more years, this remained the only Test where all of them featured in the Indian test XI.|$|E
25|$|The Intelligence to Prevent Terrorism Act was {{introduced}} to the Senate on September 28 by Senators Bob Graham (D-FL) and Jay Rockefeller (D-WV). The bill proposed a number of changes relating to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). The most significant change proposed was to require the Attorney General or head of any other Federal department or agency to disclose to the DCI any foreign intelligence acquired {{in the course of a}} criminal investigation. However, it would also have required that the DCI and Secretary of the Treasury jointly report to Congress as to whether it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> reconfigure the Office of Foreign Assets Control and its Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center to provide for the analysis and dissemination of foreign intelligence relating to the financial capabilities and resources of international terrorist organizations. It would also have required the DCI to establish and maintain a National Virtual Translation Center for timely and accurate translations of foreign intelligence for elements of the intelligence community. Another area it covered was a proposal to make the Attorney General provide a program of training to Government officials regarding the identification and use of foreign intelligence.|$|E

500|$|While D is {{a fantasy}} roleplaying game, Expedition to the Barrier Peaks {{introduces}} science fiction elements into the game. Work on the adventure began in 1976, when TSR was considering publishing a science fantasy role playing game. James M. Ward had shown them his rough notes on Metamorphosis Alpha. Gary Gygax {{thought it would}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> introduce science fiction/science fantasy concepts to D players {{through the use of}} a tournament scenario at the 1976 Origins II gaming convention in Baltimore, Maryland. Gygax started with his old Greyhawk Castle campaign material and added a spaceship, which Rob Kuntz helped him populate with monsters. Kuntz is further credited for [...] "inspiration" [...] for the module; his [...] "Machine Level" [...] having been incorporated into Greyhawk Castle and Tim Kask having played in a D game with science fantasy content run by Kuntz at GenCon VII in 1974.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2004, Halo 2 {{composer}} Martin O'Donnell and album producer Nile Rodgers decided it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> present Halo 2s music in two distinct volumes. The first volume would contain the game's themes that were finished and mixed as well as [...] "inspired-by" [...] offerings from other artists. The first volume was released alongside the video game as Volume 1 on November 9 of the same year. As the soundtrack was finished before all the in-game music was completed, none of the tracks written by O'Donnell appear in Halo 2 in the same arrangement. The bands featured in Volume 1, including Breaking Benjamin and Incubus, were enthusiastic about adding music to the soundtrack. Incubus was tapped to produce a suite of music which appears scattered throughout the soundtrack as four movements. Incubus guitarist Mike Einziger said that [...] "Halo is the only video game that ever inspired us to write a whole suite [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1967 {{during a}} meeting with Alejo Carpentier, Julio Cortázar, and Miguel Otero Silva, the Mexican author Carlos Fuentes {{launched}} a project consisting {{of a series of}} biographies depicting Latin American dictators, which was to be called Los Padres de la Patria (The Fathers of the Fatherland). After reading Edmund Wilson's portraits of the American Civil War in Patriotic Gore, Fuentes recounts, [...] "Sitting in a pub in Hampstead, we thought it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> have a comparable book on Latin America. An imaginary portrait gallery immediately stepped forward, demanding incarnation: the Latin American dictators." [...] Vargas Llosa was to write about Manuel A. Odría, Jorge Edwards about José Manuel Balmaceda, José Donoso about Mariano Melgarejo, and Julio Cortázar about Eva Perón. As M. Mar Langa Pizarro observes, the project was never completed, but it helped inspire a series of novels written by important authors during the Latin American literary boom, such as Alejo Carpentier, Augusto Roa Bastos, Gabriel García Márquez, and Mario Vargas Llosa.|$|E

500|$|Jenna's storyline in {{the episode}} {{received}} mixed reception. Canning enjoyed her subplot but found it predictable and stereotypical, while Sepinwall reported {{it did not}} work, and wrote that Jenna's stories need to have Liz or Jack featured prominently or that she be put with Scott Adsit's 30 Rock character, Pete Hornberger, as in this episode, [...] "as her insanity's only amusing when contrasted against a relatively normal character. As with Sepinwall, Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad believed Jenna's subplot was fair, observing it was great in parts but [...] "it just went on too long and got tedious and silly." [...] He believed it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> have Jenna dating or perhaps marrying a recurring character, but opined [...] "The Ones" [...] did not choose that path.

It was {{followed}} on April 23, 2002 {{by his first}} comedy CD, I Am Not Homer, in which {{he and his wife}} perform several comedy skits. The majority of the sketches had been written and performed before the CD was recorded, and Castellaneta thought that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> preserve them [...] "since [...] don't perform them much anymore." [...] Some came from their sketch series on a local radio station in Chicago and had to be lengthened from the [...] "two-minute bits" [...] that they were originally, while several others were stage sketches performed in a comedy club in Santa Monica. Additionally, [...] "Citizen Kane", a sketch in which two people discuss the film Citizen Kane with different meanings, was something the pair had performed at an art gallery. Castellaneta noted that [...] "we already knew that these skits were funny, [...] some of them we polished and tightened." [...] The skits were principally written by improvising from a basic point, transcribing the results and then editing them to the finished scene. Castellaneta chose the title I Am Not Homer as a parody of Leonard Nimoy's famous first autobiography I Am Not Spock, as well as to show that most of the comedy featured [...] "is not the typical Homer comedy." ...|$|E
500|$|Considered {{rare for}} Disney animals, Pascal and Maximus do not speak.

Identifying themselves as [...] "huge fans" [...] of Chaplin, Greno and Howard suggested that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> have a character like the actor featured in the film. Additionally, the directors explained in an interview with Orange that Pascal and Maximus' silence was also inspired by the roles of Princess Aurora's animal friends in Disney's Sleeping Beauty (1959), following the film's rules and guidelines that even though they do not talk, they remain [...] "very expressive" [...] nonetheless and [...] "act and understand without words." [...] Maximus particularly [...] "belongs to the grand tradition of Disney creatures that are full of personality even though they don't talk." [...] One film critic observed that Pascal and Maximus [...] "have personalities all their own, making use of techniques harkening back to the silent era". Howard explained that [...] "Pantomime acting is a great challenge for our animators" [...] because, according to animator Jin Kim, Pascal and Maximus both [...] "had to be funny without speech", forcing the animators to exaggerate their emotions and facial expressions. The Chicago Sun-Times observed that [...] "Pascal ... doesn't speak, but manages to convey himself with eye rolls and changes of color." [...] Both animals' sound effects are provided by American actor Frank Welker.|$|E

500|$|To {{spread his}} costs over more magazines, Silberkleit soon decided to launch two {{additional}} titles. [...] In November 1939 {{the first issue}} of Future Fiction appeared; it was followed in July 1940 by Science Fiction Quarterly. [...] Hornig was editor for all three of the magazines. [...] In October 1940, Hornig, who was a pacifist, received his military call-up. [...] He decided to move to California and register as a conscientious objector; he continued to edit the magazines from the west coast, but Silberkleit was unhappy with the arrangement. [...] Silberkleit allowed Hornig to retain his post as editor of Science Fiction, and offered the editorship of the other two titles to Sam Moskowitz. [...] Moskowitz declined, saying afterwards that he [...] "would never strike at a man's job", but Donald Wollheim, a member of a group of aspiring writers called the Futurians, heard about the offer. [...] Wollheim told Robert W. Lowndes, another member of the Futurians, about the opening, and urged him to write to Silberkleit. [...] Lowndes later recalled Wollheim's idea: [...] "In the letter, I'd suggest that it might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> add a science fiction title to the list, offering my services as editor at a slightly lower price than Hornig was being paid, and also find fault with all the other sf titles presently out, but particularly with Hornig's". [...] Lowndes relates that Silberkleit took the bait and hired him in November 1940; Hornig recalls the separation as being by mutual consent because of his move to California.

[...] Lowndes subsequently agreed that this was likely to be the real reason Silberkleit replaced Hornig. [...] The first issues Lowndes was responsible for were the Spring 1941 issue of Science Fiction Quarterly and the April 1941 issue of Future Fiction. [...] He completed the preparations for the last issue of Science Fiction, dated September 1941, but he used material that Hornig had already selected for the article, with minor exceptions. [...] The changes included the replacement of Fantasy Times, a fan department by James Taurasi, with Futurian Times, a similar department from a rival group of fans, the Futurians, to which Lowndes belonged. [...] Initially Silberkleit kept tighter control on Lowndes' editorial selections than he had on Hornig's, vetoing five of the seven stories Lowndes proposed for the April 1941 Future, but by the August 1941 issue, Lowndes later recalled, Silberkleit [...] "was satisfied that I knew what I was doing, and... didn't need to oversee any story I had accepted".|$|E
