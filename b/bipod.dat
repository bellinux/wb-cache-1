5|$|The M249 LMG entered {{service in}} 1984 as the M249 SAW. Initial {{reactions}} to the gun were mixed: it fulfilled the light machine gun role well when fired from the ground, but was not as effective when fired from the shoulder or hip. It was praised for its extreme durability and massive firepower, though {{a number of areas}} for improvement were highlighted: the blank firing attachment fitted poorly, the <b>bipod</b> was very weak and broke easily, the sling attachment was awkward, and there were many slots and gaps that accumulated dirt. Some claimed that the heavy-barrelled version of the M16 rifle was a more effective light machine gun.|$|E
5|$|The M249 is gas {{operated}} and air-cooled. It has a quick-change barrel, allowing the gunner to rapidly replace an overheated or jammed barrel. A folding <b>bipod</b> is attached {{near the front}} of the gun, though an M192 LGM tripod is available. It can be fed from both linked ammunition and STANAG magazines, like those used in the M16 and M4. This allows the SAW gunner to use a rifleman's magazines as an emergency source of ammunition in the event that he runs out of linked rounds.|$|E
5|$|There were no {{facilities}} in Port Moresby {{for the bulk}} storage of petroleum products, so they were shipped and distributed in 44-gallon drums, as they were known in SWPA, where food and fuel distribution was through the Australian Army, which used the imperial gallon. A shortage of 44-gallon drums developed in late 1942. Some 150,000 went north but only 10,000 returned. New production was ordered from Rheem in Australia, and civilian holders of 44-gallon drums were urged to empty and return them. Unserviceable drums were either repaired by the Bulk Issues Petrol and Oil Depot (<b>BIPOD)</b> or handed over to salvage. A well-organised collection effort was undertaken by the Port Moresby Base Sub Area which resulted in over 20,000 empty drums being returned to Australia in November.|$|E
50|$|On firearms, <b>bipods</b> are {{commonly}} used on rifles and machine guns to provide a forward rest and reduce motion. They are also seen on other long-barrelled weapons. <b>Bipods</b> permit operators to easily rest a weapon on objects, like the ground or a wall, reducing their fatigue and increasing accuracy and stability. <b>Bipods</b> can be of fixed or adjustable length. Some can be tilted and also have their tilting point close to the barrel's central axis, allowing the weapon to tilt left and right. Some designs also allow the weapon to be rotated side-to-side. There are three ways for <b>bipods</b> to be folded: away from the shooter, towards the shooter, or into a vertical foregrip.|$|R

25|$|The ARM {{light machine}} gun variant is {{additionally}} equipped with a carrying handle, folding <b>bipod</b> and a larger wooden handguard. The wooden handguard remains cooler during sustained automatic fire and has grooves for <b>bipod</b> storage. When folded, the bipod's legs form a speed chute for rapid magazine insertion; the <b>bipod</b> will form a wire cutter and the rear handguard ferrule, which retains the <b>bipod</b> legs, {{can be used to}} open bottles by design, in order to prevent soldiers using magazine lips for this purpose which damaged them.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bipods</b> can be {{of fixed}} or {{adjustable}} length. Those of higher quality can be tilted and also have their tilting point close to the bore central axis, allowing the weapon to tilt left and right a small amount, allowing a quick horizontal sight picture on uneven ground and keeping the operator close to the ground. <b>Bipods</b> {{are for the most}} part folded forward, not back.|$|R

25|$|The Left <b>Bipod</b> Foam Ramp is an {{approximately}} three-foot (one-meter) long aerodynamic component made {{entirely of}} foam. The foam, not normally {{considered to be}} a structural material, is required to bear some aerodynamic loads. Because of these special requirements, the casting-in-place and curing of the ramps may be performed only by a senior technician. The <b>bipod</b> ramp (having left and right sides) was originally designed to reduce aerodynamic stresses around the <b>bipod</b> attachment points at the external tank, but it was proven unnecessary {{in the wake of the}} accident and was removed from the external tank design for tanks flown after STS-107 (another foam ramp along the liquid oxygen line was also later removed from the tank design to eliminate it as a foam debris source, after analysis and tests proved this change safe).|$|E
25|$|Post-disaster {{analysis}} revealed that two previous shuttle launches (STS-52 and -62) also had <b>bipod</b> ramp foam loss that went undetected. In addition, Protuberance Air Load (PAL) ramp foam had also shed pieces, and there were also spot losses from large-area foams.|$|E

Although an improvement over the M14 when in full-auto, it was still difficult to control, overheated rapidly, and the 20-round magazine limited its ability to deliver suppressive fire.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the current opto-mechanical design of NFIRAOS (Narrow Field InfraRed Adaptive Optics System) for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). The preliminary design update review for NFIRAOS was successfully held in December 2011, and incremental design progress has since occurred on several fronts. The majority of NFIRAOS is housed within an insulated and cooled enclosure, and operates at - 30 C to reduce background emissivity. The cold optomechanics {{are attached to}} a space-frame structure, kinematically supported by <b>bipods</b> that penetrate the insulated enclosure. The <b>bipods</b> are attached to an exo-structure at ambient temperature, which also supports up to three client science instruments and a science calibration unit.
