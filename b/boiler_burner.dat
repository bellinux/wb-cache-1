Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Biomass (conventional and non-conventional) fuels co-fired with coal for power and steam generation are being tested and evaluated at several generation stations in the United States. The co-firing technology is expected to reduce landfill requirements for biomass wastes, and to provide a renewable, low pollution and zero net carbon dioxide fuel. The choice of the biomass depends upon local availability and cost of the transportation. The renewable biomass fuels range from agro to animal waste based fuels. For coal fired power plants located around feedlots where cattle are raised, the renewable biomass is the cattle manure, called feedlot biomass (FB). Thus coal could be mixed with feedlot biomass and then fired in existing boiler burners. A 30 KW (100, 000 Btu/hr) <b>boiler</b> <b>burner</b> facility was built at Texas A&M University <b>Boiler</b> <b>Burner</b> Laboratory and the burner was fired with coal or coal-FB blends. Most of the previous data concerned with coal performance results from co-firing of low moisture FB (25 %); so feeding at low flow rate becomes a problem. In order to test the effects of moisture on burner performance, the reactor was modified with external water injection through an atomizer in order to simulate higher moisture. The atomizer uses an airblast to atomize the water into finer droplets. At fixed equivalence ratio and swirl number for the secondary inlet air stream, the test variables selected were simulated moisture contents and particle sizes of feedlot biomass. Measurements of NO[], O?, CO and CO? along the furnace are reported. The summaries of results are as follows. With the atomized air only (i. e. without external water injection), the NO[] concentrations increased from 350 ppm to 650 ppm while CO decreased from 46, 000 ppm to 18, 000 ppm (data measured at the first probe, 6 " from the burner). The external water injection used to simulate high moisture FB decreased the pollutant emissions (NO[]) from 570 ppm (zero external water with atomizing air injection) to 300 ppm (40 % water in FB) but increased CO from 2, 500 ppm (zero external water with atomizing air injection) to 10, 500 ppm (40 % water in FB) (data of moisture effect measured at the last probe, 36 " from the burner) due to more incomplete burning.

40|$|An all-solid-state continuous-wave (cw) {{laser system}} for {{ultraviolet}} absorption {{measurements of the}} nitric oxide (NO) molecule has been developed and demonstrated.

The sum-frequency-mixing process occurs in a beta-barium borate crystal. The nitric oxide absorption measurements are performed by tuning the ECDL and scanning the sum-frequency-mixed radiation over strong nitric oxide absorption lines near 226 nm.

40|$|Reburn {{with animal}} waste yield NO{sub x} {{reduction}} {{of the order of}} 70 - 80 %, which is much higher than those previously reported in the literature for natural gas, coal and agricultural biomass as reburn fuels. Further, the NO{sub x} reduction is almost independent of stoichiometry from stoichiometric to upto 10 % deficient air in reburn zone. As a first step towards understanding the reburn process in a <b>boiler</b> <b>burner,</b> a simplified zero-dimensional model has been developed for estimating the NO{sub x} reduction in the reburn process using simulated animal waste based biomass volatiles. However the first model does not include the gradual heat up of reburn fuel particle, pyrolysis and char combustion. Hence {{there is a need for}} more rigorous treatment of the model with animal waste as reburn fuel. To address this issue, an improved zero-dimensional model is being developed which can handle any solid reburn fuel, along with more detailed heterogeneous char reactions and homogeneous global reactions. The model on ''NO{sub x} Reduction for Reburn Process using Feedlot Biomass,'' incorporates; (a) mixing between reburn fuel and main-burner gases, (b) gradual heat-up of reburn fuel accompanied by pyrolysis, oxidation of volatiles and char oxidation, (c) fuel-bound nitrogen (FBN) pyrolysis, and FBN including both forward and backward reactions, (d) prediction of NO{sub x} as a function of time in the reburn zone, and (e) gas phase and solid phase temperature as a function of time. The fuel bound nitrogen is assumed to be released to the gas phase by two processes, (a) FBN evolution to N{sub 2 }, HCN, and NH{sub 3 }, and (b) FBN oxidation to NO at the char surface. The formulation has been completed, code has been developed, and preliminary runs have been made to test the code. Note that, the current model does not incorporate the overfire air. The results of the simulation will be compared with the experimental results. During this quarter, three journal and four conference publications dealing with utilization of animal waste as fuel have been published.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Power plants spend nearly 50 billion dollars a year on fuel cost. Presently coal accounts for over 75 % of the electricity generated in this country. Due to increasingly harsh environmental regulations, the demand for low sulfur (S) coal has dramatically increased. This increase in demand is expected to cause the price of coal to rise. Such a senario has caused the utilities to explore the possibilities of supplementing coal with fuel alternatives such as the byproducts of process industries. The supplemental fuel for utilities located near feedlots (e. g. Northwest Texas) happens to be feedlot manure. Feedlot manure is attractive because it is nearly ten times cheaper than coal and is relatively inexpensive to transport. There exists nearly six million head of cattle in Northwest Texas which produce 25, 000 tons of manure each day. Feedlot manure presents water and air pollution concerns if not disposed of properly. As such, the feedlot operators are eager to find methods of safely disposing of the feedlot manure. A small scale <b>boiler</b> <b>burner</b> facility has been constructed to simulate a utility class boiler. Experiments were conducted with coal only and then for coal/feedlot manure. Three types of feedlot manure are examined; raw feedlot manure, partially composted feedlot manure, and finished composted feedlot manure. Performance characteristics and emission data were taken for each case. A summary of the results is as follows: (I) sulfur Wyoming coal was fired and a gasification efficiency of 66 % was measured. (i I) Emissions measurements were recorded and it was seen that emissions of NO,, and S 02 increased as the burnt mass fraction increased. However, all emissions were within NSPS guidelines. (iii) The successful firing of coal and feedlot manure was achieved, a gasification efficiency in the range of 86 % was measured, which is higher than 66 % obtained when firing coal alone. (iv) When the fuel blend is fully burnt, the NO,, emissions with the blend firing was lower than the firing of coal alone...|$|E
50|$|Tri-sector {{types are}} the most common in modern power {{generation}} facilities. In the tri-sector design, the largest sector (usually spanning about half the cross-section of the casing) is connected to the boiler hot gas outlet. The hot exhaust gas flows over the central element, transferring some of its heat to the element, and is then ducted away for further treatment in dust collectors and other equipment before being expelled from the flue gas stack. The second, smaller sector, is fed with ambient air by a fan, which passes over the heated element as it rotates into the sector, and is heated before being carried to the boiler furnace for combustion. The third sector is the smallest one and it heats air which is routed into the pulverizers and used to carry the coal-air mixture to coal <b>boiler</b> <b>burners.</b> Thus, the total air heated in the RAPH provides: heating air to remove the moisture from the pulverised coal dust, carrier air for transporting the pulverised coal to the <b>boiler</b> <b>burners</b> and the primary air for combustion. The rotor itself is the medium of heat transfer in this system, and is usually composed of some form of steel and/or ceramic structure. It rotates quite slowly (around 3-5 RPM) to allow optimum heat transfer first from the hot exhaust gases to the element, then as it rotates, from the element to the cooler air in the other sectors.|$|R

The goal of the DOE-sponsored work is to demonstrate an industrial <b>boiler</b> <b>burner</b> with NOx emissions below 9 ppm and CO emissions below 50 ppm (corrected to 3 % stack oxygen). To be commercially successful, these very low levels of NOx and CO must be achievable without significantly affecting other measures of burner performance such as reliability, turndown, and thermal efficiency. Phase 1 of the project demonstrated that sub- 9 ppm NOx emissions and sub- 50 ppm CO emissions (corrected to 3 % oxygen) could be achieved with the RSB in a 3 million Btu/Hr laboratory boiler using several methods of NOx reduction. The RSB was also tested in a 60 million Btu/hr steam generator used by Chevron for Thermally Enhanced Oil Recovery (TEOR). In the larger scale tests, fuel staging was demonstrated, with the RSB consistently achieving sub- 20 ppm NOx and as low as 10 ppm NOx. Large-scale steam generator tests also demonstrated that flue gas recirculation (FGR) provided a more predictable and reliable method of achieving sub- 9 ppm NOx levels. Based on the results of tests at San Francisco Thermal and Chevron, the near-term approach selected by Alzeta for achieving low NOx is to use FGR. This decision was based on a number of factors, with the most important being that FGR has proved to be an easier approach to transfer to different facilities and boiler designs. In addition, staging has proved difficult to implement in a way that allows good combustion and emissions performance in a fully modulating system. In Phase 3 of the project, the RSB will be demonstrated as a very low emissions burner product suitable for continuous operation in a commercial installation. As such, the Phase 3 field demonstration will represent the first installation in which the RSB will be operated continuously with a sub- 9 ppm guarantee...|$|E
40|$|Mercury is {{a leading}} concern among the air toxic metals {{addressed}} in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) because of its volatility, persistence, and bioaccumulation as methylmercury in the environment and its neurological health impacts. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports for 2001 shows that total mercury emissions from all sources in USA is about 145 tons per annum, of which coal fired power plants contribute around 33 % of it, about 48 tons per annum. Unlike other trace metals that are emitted in particulate form, mercury is released in vapor phase in elemental (Hg 0) or oxidized (Hg 2 +, mainly HgCl 2) form. To date, there is no post combustion treatment which can effectively capture elemental mercury vapor, but the oxidized form of mercury can be captured in traditional emission control devices such as wet flue gas defulrization (WFGD) units, since oxidized mercury (HgCl 2) is soluble in water. The chlorine concentration present during coal combustion {{plays a major role}} in mercury oxidation, which is evident from the fact that plants burning coal having high chlorine content have less elemental mercury emissions. A novel method of co-firing blends of low chlorine content coal with high chlorine content cattle manure/biomass was used in order to study its effect on mercury oxidation. For Texas Lignite and Wyoming coal the concentrations of chlorine are 139 ppm and 309 ppm on dry ash free basis, while for Low Ash Partially Composted Dairy Biomass it is 2, 691 ppm. Co-firing experiments were performed in a 100, 000 BTU/hr (29. 3 kWt) <b>Boiler</b> <b>Burner</b> facility located in the Coal and Biomass Energy laboratory (CBEL); coal and biomass blends in proportions of 80 : 20, 90 : 10, 95 : 5 and 100 : 0 were investigated as fuels. The percentage reduction of Hg with 95 : 5, 90 : 10 and 80 : 20 blends were measured to be 28 - 50 %, 42 - 62 % and 71 - 75 % respectively. Though cattle biomass serves as an additive to coal, to increase the chlorine concentration, it leads to higher ash loading. Low Ash and High Ash Partially Composted Dairy Biomass have 164 % and 962 % more ash than Wyoming coal respectively. As the fraction of cattle biomass in blend increases in proportion, ash loading problems increase simultaneously. An optimum blend ratio is arrived and suggested as 90 : 10 blend with good reduction in mercury emissions without any compromise on ash loading...|$|E

In Year 2 described in this progress report, the Toptica ECDL in the original system was replaced with a Sacher Lasers ECDL. The mode-hop-free tuning range and tuning rate of the Toptica ECDL were 25 GHz and a few Hz, respectively. The mode-hop-free tuning range and tuning rate of the Sacher Lasers ECDL were 90 GHz and a few hundred Hz, respectively. The Sacher Lasers ECDL thus allows us to scan over the entire NO absorption line and to determine the absorption baseline with increased accuracy and precision. The increased tuning rate is an advantage in that data can be acquired much more rapidly and the absorption measurements are less susceptible {{to the effects of}} transient fluctuations in the properties of the coal combustor exhaust stream. Gas cell measurements were performed using the NO sensor with the new ECDL, and a few spectra were acquired from the coal exhaust stream. However, the laser diode in the new ECDL failed during the coal combustor tests.

In the current work, dairy biomass (DB) is evaluated as a cofiring fuel with coal in a small scale 29 Â kWt <b>boiler</b> <b>burner</b> facility. Two types of coal (Texas lignite, TXL and Wyoming Powder River Basin coal, WYO) and two forms of partially composted DB fuels were investigated (low ash separated solids LA-PC-SepSol-DB and high ash soil surface HA-PC-SoilSurf-DB). Proximate and ultimate analyses performed on both coals and both DBs reveal the following: higher heating value (HHV) of 28, 460 - 29, 590 Â kJ/kg for dry ash free (DAF) coals and 21, 450 Â kJ/kg for DB; nitrogen loading of 0. 36 and 0. 48 Â kg/GJ for WYO and TXL, respectively and 1. 50 and 2. 67 Â kg/GJ for the LA-PC-SepSol-DB and the HA-PC-SoilSurf-DB respectively; sulfur loading of 0. 15 and 0. 42 Â kg/GJ WYO and TXL, respectively and 0. 33 and 0. 43 Â kg/GJ for the LA-PC-SepSol-DB and the HA-PC-SoilSurf-DB respectively; ash loading from 3. 10 to 8. 02 Â kg/GJ for the coals and from 11. 57 to 139 Â kg/GJ for the DB fuels. The cofiring experiments were performed with 90 : 10 and 80 : 20 and 100 : 00 (mass%) coal:DB blend (96 : 4, 92 : 8, 100 : 00 - % on heat basis). The results revealed that the blend burns more completely in the boiler, due to the earlier release of biomass volatiles and higher amount of volatile matter. Results were obtained for burnt fraction, NOx and CO emission. Pure TXL produced 1505 Â ppm of CO at an equivalence ratio of 1. 1. An 80 : 20 blend of TXL:LA-PC-SepSol-DB produced 4084 Â ppm of CO at the same equivalence ratio. The NOx emissions for equivalence ratio varying from 0. 9 to 1. 2 ranged from 0. 4 to 0. 13 Â kg/GJ for pure TXL coal. The corresponding NOx emissions are 0. 8 - 0. 10 Â kg/GJ for pure WYO coal. For 80 : 20 TXL:LA-SepS-DB blend they ranged from 0. 375 to 0. 05 Â kg/GJ over the same range. In general, the blends produced less NOx than pure coal under rich conditions even though the DB contained more nitrogen.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. In the U. S. alone, approximately 200 million tons of dry cattle waste are being produced annually. Recently, cattle and poultry manure have been classified as biomass fuels and have been identified as sources of renewable energy. One of the processes for energy conversion of biomass fuels is thermochemical gasification. For the current study, a laboratory scale, 10 kW[th], fixed-bed gasifier (reactor internal diameter 0. 15 m, reactor height 0. 30 m) facility was built at the Texas A&M University <b>Boiler</b> <b>Burner</b> Laboratory, and was fired with a) coal, b) feedlot biomass (FB), c) chicken litter biomass (LB), d) high ash feedlot biomass (HFB), e) coal: FB blend (CFB), f) coal: LB blend (CLB), g) coal: HFB blend (CHFB), and h) LB: HFB blend (LHFB). The temperature profiles, and the gas species profile in the bed are measured and the species analyzed for heat contribution. The parametric studies include the effect of fuel particle size (average particle used were 0. 52 mm and 9. 5 mm), and the air flow rate (45 and 60 SCFH) on the gasification characteristics of the fuels. A summary of the results is as follows: The peak temperature in the bed was about 1500 K for coal (4. 28 % ash), 1350 K for FB (14. 83 % ash), and 1200 K for LB (43. 85 % ash), correlating the decreased peak temperature with increased ash content. The devolatilization of coal, FB, and LB yielded the following: CH? (%) : 2. 5, 1. 8, 1. 0, CO (%) : 27. 9, 29. 1, 29. 1, H?: 8. 5, 8. 0, 7. 0. On an average, the heating value of the product gas leaving the gasifier was about 5. 0 MJ/m? for coal, 4. 8 MJ/m? for FB, and 4. 5 MJ/m? for LB. The gasification efficiency (45 SCFH) was the lowest for coal (37 %), followed by 39 % for FB, and 68. 47 % for LB fuels. LB (18. 9 % (Na?O + K?O) in ash) showed consistent bed agglomeration, while FB (7. 03 %) showed a reduced tendency for agglomeration, and coal (1. 98 %) exhibited no agglomeration in the bed. Based on the current gasification study FB is preferred compared to LB, since the former has a lesser tendency to agglomerate...|$|E
40|$|Intensive {{animal feeding}} {{operations}} create {{large amounts of}} animal waste that must be safely disposed of {{in order to avoid}} environmental degradation. Cattle feedlots and chicken houses are two examples. In feedlots, cattle are confined to small pens and fed a high calorie grain diet in preparation for slaughter. In chicken houses, thousands of chickens are kept in close proximity. In both of these operations, millions of tons of manure are produced every year. In this project a co-firing technology is proposed which would use manure that cannot be used for fertilizer, for power generation. Since the animal manure has economic uses as both a fertilizer and as a fuel, it is properly referred to as feedlot biomass (FB) for cow manure, or litter biomass (LB) for chicken manure. The biomass will be used a as a fuel by mixing it with coal in a 90 : 10 blend and firing it in existing coal fired combustion devices. This technique is known as co-firing, and the high temperatures produced by the coal will allow the biomass to be completely combusted. Therefore, it is the goal of the current research to develop an animal biomass cofiring technology. A cofiring technology is being developed by performing: (1) studies on fundamental fuel characteristics, (2) small scale <b>boiler</b> <b>burner</b> experiments, (3) gasifier experiments, (4) computer simulations, and (5) an economic analysis. The fundamental fuel studies reveal that biomass is not as high a quality fuel as coal. The biomass fuels are higher in ash, higher in moisture, higher in nitrogen and sulfur (which can cause air pollution), and lower in heat content than coal. Additionally, experiments indicate that the biomass fuels have higher gas content, release gases more readily than coal, and less homogeneous. Small-scale boiler experiments revealed that the biomass blends can be successfully fired, and NO{sub x} pollutant emissions produced will be similar to or lower than pollutant emissions when firing coal. This is a surprising result as the levels of N are higher in the biomass fuel than in coal. Further experiments showed that biomass is twice or more effective than coal when used in a reburning process to reduce NO{sub x} emissions. Since crushing costs of biomass fuels may be prohibitive, stoker firing may be cost effective; in order simulate such a firing, future work will investigate the performance of a gasifier when fired with larger sized coal and biomass. It will be a fixed bed gasifier, and will evaluate blends, coal, and biomass. Computer simulations were performed using the PCGC- 2 code supplied by BYU and modified by A&M with three mixture fractions for handling animal based biomass fuels in order to include an improved moisture model for handling wet fuels and phosphorus oxidation. Finally the results of the economic analysis show that considerable savings can be achieved with the use of biomass. In the case of higher ash and moisture biomass, the fuel cost savings will be reduced, due to increased transportation costs. A spreadsheet program was created to analyze the fuel savings for a variety of different moisture levels, ash levels, and power plant operating parameters...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to engineer, design, fabricate, and field demonstrate a <b>Boiler</b> <b>Burner</b> Energy System Technology (BBEST) that integrates a low-cost, clean burning, gas-fired simple-cycle (unrecuperated) 100 kWe (net) microturbine (SCMT) with a new ultra low-NOx gas-fired burner (ULNB) into one compact Combined Heat and Power (CHP) product that can be retrofit on new and existing industrial and commercial boilers in place of conventional burners. The Scope of Work for this project was segmented into two principal phases: (Phase I) Hardware development, assembly and pre-test and (Phase II) Field installation and demonstration testing. Phase I was divided into five technical tasks (Task 2 to 6). These tasks covered the engineering, design, fabrication, testing and optimization of each key component of the CHP system principally, ULNB, SCMT, assembly BBEST CHP package, and integrated controls. Phase I work culminated with the laboratory testing of the completed BBEST assembly prior to shipment for field installation and demonstration. Phase II consisted of two remaining technical tasks (Task 7 and 8), which focused on the installation, startup, and field verification tests at a pre-selected industrial plant to document performance and attainment of all project objectives. Technical direction and administration was under the management of CMCE, Inc. Altex Technologies Corporation lead the design, assembly and testing of the system. Field demonstration was supported by Leva Energy, the commercialization firm founded by executives at CMCE and Altex. Leva Energy has applied for patent protection on the BBEST process under the trade name of Power Burner and holds the license for the burner currently used in the product. The commercial term Power Burner is used throughout this report {{to refer to the}} BBEST technology proposed for this project. The project was co-funded by the California Energy Commission and the Southern California Gas Company (SCG), a division of Sempra Energy. These match funds were provided via concurrent contracts and investments available via CMCE, Altex, and Leva Energy The project attained all its objectives and is considered a success. CMCE secured the support of GI&E from Italy to supply 100 kW Turbec T- 100 microturbines for the project. One was purchased by the project’s subcontractor, Altex, and a second spare was purchased by CMCE under this project. The microturbines were then modified to convert from their original recuperated design to a simple cycle configuration. Replacement low-NOx silo combustors were designed and bench tested in order to achieve compliance with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) 2007 emission limits for NOx and CO when in CHP operation. The converted microturbine was then mated with a low NOx burner provided by Altex via an integration section that allowed flow control and heat recovery to minimize combustion blower requirements; manage burner turndown; and recover waste heat. A new fully integrated control system was designed and developed that allowed one-touch system operation in all three available modes of operation: (1) CHP with both microturbine and burner firing for boiler heat input greater than 2 MMBtu/hr; (2) burner head only (BHO) when the microturbine is under service; and (3) microturbine only when boiler heat input requirements fall below 2 MMBtu/hr. This capability resulted in a burner turndown performance of nearly 10 / 1, a key advantage for this technology over conventional low NOx burners. Key components were then assembled into a cabinet with additional support systems for generator cooling and fuel supply. System checkout and performance tests were performed in the laboratory. The assembled system and its support equipment were then shipped and installed at a host facility where final performance tests were conducted following efforts to secure fabrication, air, and operating permits. The installed power burner is now in commercial operation and has achieved all the performance goals...|$|E
40|$|Biomass is a {{sustainable}} energy source with significant potentials for replacing fos-sil fuels and {{electricity for heating}} purposes. Present residential wood combustion can, however, be {{a significant source of}} ambient urban air pollutants such as vola-tile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and particulate matter. Ambient exposure to these pollutants in general has been associated with differ-ent health effects such as cardiopulmonary disease/mortality and cancer risks [1 – 3]. Wood pellets are generally a clean, dry and easily fed fuel to be used in special <b>boilers,</b> <b>burners</b> and stoves on the residential market. Compared with other modern technologies, the majority of the wood-fired appliances currently used suffer from poorly optimized conditions, resulting in considerable emissions of products from incomplete combustion. New and upgraded biomass fuels provide possibilities of more controlled and optimized combustion with less emission of PIC [4]. For future health impact assessments, regulatory standards and evaluations concerning present and future residential biomass combustion, as well as a solid qualitative and quanti-tative knowledge of the emissions from different sources, are of vital importance. In consequence, there is still a strong need for detailed characterization and quantifica-tion of the emissions from residential biomass appliances when using different fuels and combustion techniques [5]...|$|R

40|$|The {{operation}} of energy facilities produce a constant effect upon the environment. Often, the environmental load {{can be reduced}} by transferring heat electropower stations to burning more environmentally friendly fuels, such as natural gas. An interesting case is the Vladivostok CHPP- 2 partially transferred to the burning of natural gas in 2012. The paper deals with the design and technical and economic parameters of the {{operation of}} the boiler having the steam capacity of 210 tons per hour at the Vladivostok CHPP- 2 before and after the latter’s reconstruction, when it was transferred from solid fuels to gaseous ones. The reconstruction has made it possible to reduce the emissions of harmful gaseous substances into atmosphere by an average of 2. 5 – 4 times. Particularly harmful are emissions of nitrogen oxides due to the fact that, during combustion, it is the air nitrogen that is primarily oxidised. The examination of the created mathematical model has demonstrated the best operating conditions for boilers transferred to gaseous fuels. Also, the areas of occurrence of nitrogen oxides as well as the dynamics of their changes in different operating modes of the <b>boiler</b> <b>burners</b> have been revealed. Certain operation modes enable one to decrease the emissions of nitrogen oxide nearly twice. Certain ways to suppress the nitrogen oxides during combustion have been presented as well...|$|R

30|$|Global {{concerns}} {{about the impact of}} toxic gases and effluents on the environment have led to the platinum industry leaders to adopt new strategies of recycling or capturing mine waste. Carbon dioxide (CO 2), for example, from coal-fired power stations and the environment is currently being captured and stored in coal seams underground [1, 2]. Hesselmann and Hough have reported the development of the technology of converting toxic oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from well-designed <b>boiler</b> <b>burners</b> using ammonia-based reagent and hydrocarbon into a flue gas containing NOx and some O 2 [3]. They found that at elevated temperatures the hydrocarbon auto ignites, forming plasma, and creating radicals. These radicals catalysed the NOx reduction reactions—autocatalysis—and the resulting flue gas was found to contain very low NOx and small level of ammonia slip. Other researchers have also reported on the concept of capturing SO 2 from fluidized-bed reactors during coal gasification using dolomite [4]. However, there is scanty literature on the application of acidic chloride solutions as a means of capturing SO 2 from flue gases and the same time precipitate the precious metals as sulphides. It is established that dissolved sulphur reacts readily with base and precious metal ions to form metal sulphides [5, 6, 7]. In industrial sedimentation processes, reduction of metal ions such as sulphides is accomplished by contacting metal-rich solutions with commercial H 2 S or SO 2 gases. To utilize commercial SO 2 gases or other sulphur-bearing gases for recovering metals from solution, it is necessary to put in place effective mechanisms for capturing and solubilizing gases.|$|R
