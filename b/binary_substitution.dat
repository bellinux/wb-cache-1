Previous {{studies have shown that}} analysis of concatenated alignments using maximum likelihood (ML) can produce misleading results. We develop a polynomial-time method that constructs a species tree through inferred rooted triples from concatenated alignments. We call this method SuperMatrix Rooted Triple (SMRT). We show that SMRT performs well in simulations and then show that it is a statistically consistent estimator of a clocklike species tree under a <b>binary</b> <b>substitution</b> model as well as other assumptions. SMRT is therefore a computationally efficient and statistically consistent estimator of species trees...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} point defects on {{persistent}} currents in mesoscopic rings is studied {{in a simple}} tight-binding model. Using an analogy with {{the treatment of the}} critical quantum Ising chain with defects, conformal invariance techniques are employed to relate the persistent current amplitude to the Hamiltonian spectrum just above the Fermi energy. From this, the dependence of the current on the magnetic flux is found exactly for a ring with one or two point defects. The effect of an aperiodic modulation of the ring, generated through a <b>binary</b> <b>substitution</b> sequence, on the persistent current is also studied. The flux-dependence of the current is found to vary remarkably between the Fibonacci and the Thue-Morse sequences...|$|E

For ligands of the first series, the hydrophobicity of para-substituents and the bulk of meta-substituents are shown to be the deciding factors. Similarly, for the other series, the <b>binary</b> <b>substitutions</b> at X-, Y- and R-positions, highlighted by respective dummy variables, and the bulk rendered by groups at R(1) -position, {{are found to be}} significantly correlated with A(1) - and A(2) -receptor affinities. Additionally, the Free-Wilson study of this series resulting into individual substituent contribution, provides similar inferences to these, but in a more exact manner. This study also hints at the possibility of a different accommodation site at the receptor for the R(1) -substituents of the congeners on account of conformational dissimilarity of A(1) - and A(2) -receptors. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Crystallographic group {{theory is}} {{commonly}} {{regarded as the}} method of choice for the description of crystal structures and related phenomena such as phase transformations, antiphase domain formation and twinning. Symmetry alone, however, merely comprises a qualitative picture. On the contrary, number theory seems to be far less explored within a crystallographic context, whereas it possibly allows for a more quantitative arithmetic approach. An illustrative example is given by so-called multiplicative congruential generators (MCGs), i. e. recurrence relations of the form Z(n+ 1) = m Z(n) (mod M), first introduced by Lehmer for the generation of pseudorandom number sequences. However, Marsaglia later noted that MCGs exhibit an intrinsic sublattice structure, which was shown to have some implications for the description of crystal structures. Another example {{is due to the}} bit-reversal, quasirandom number sequences of van der Corput, which exhibit features related to quasiperiodic <b>binary</b> <b>substitution</b> tilings. Both approaches share a common basis, as the integer sequences involved for the generation of the corresponding two- or three-dimensional point sets and their coordinate description are mere permutations of a finite set of successive natural numbers. Notably both methods have their primary application in the generation of random numbers, which sheds some light on the subtle interrelations between distinct states of order. Following the aforementioned number-theoretic construction principles allows for the systematic (algorithmic) generation of artificial crystal structures (permutation structures), as well as their combinatorial enumeration and classification. The peculiar structure of beta-Mn has already identified as a near-miss to these envisioned permutation structures. ...|$|E
40|$|The present work investigates heat {{conduction}} from lattice vibrations {{in a class}} of materials called half-Heuslers. The composition under investigation was XNiSn half-Heusler alloys where X=Ti, Zr or Hf. These materials have received a lot of attention for their favorable properties for hermoelectric applications. However, their lattice thermal conductivity is too high to be applicable as a thermoelectric material. Previous studies have shown that lattice thermal conductivity can be reduced by isoelectronic substitutions on the X-site or by reducing the grain size. The lattice thermal conductivity is calculated by using density functional theory and the phonon Boltzmann transport equation with the frozen phonon approach. Anharmonic three-phonon scattering was used to assess lattice thermal conductivity of pure TiNiSn, ZrNiSn and HfNiSn, the results had good accordance to experimental values. However, a slight overestimation was observed {{due to the fact that}} experimental samples exhibit microstructures which may affect the lattice thermal conductivity. The effect of alloying was then explored within the virtual crystal approximation, making it possible to screen all possible ternary substitutions in the composition Ti_x Hf_ y Zr_(1 -x-y) NiSn. The lowest lattice thermal conductivity was found for the <b>binary</b> <b>substitution</b> where X=Ti and Hf, in the composition Ti_ 0. 5 Hf_ 0. 5 NiSn. Finally, a simple model for boundary scattering was used to quantify the effect of finite grain sizes on lattice thermal conductivity. Using values of the grain size obtained from experimental measurements as input when calculating lattice thermal conductivity showed very good accordance to experimental measurements of lattice thermal conductivity. This study demonstrated that modeling based on first principles can be used to quantify contributions from various scattering mechanisms and thus predict the thermal conductivity of given alloy compositions with a specific grain size...|$|E
40|$|Multivariate {{profiling}} aims to find {{groups in}} a response dataset that are described by relationships with another. Profiling is not predicting each variable within the response set, but finding stable relationships between the two datasets that define common groups. Profiling styles of analysis arise commonly {{within the context of}} survey, experimental design and diagnosis type of studies. These studies produce complex multivariate datasets that contain mixed variables often with missing values that require analysis with a flexible, stable statistical technique. The profiling model under consideration within this thesis is a Classification and Regression Tree (CART). A standard CART model finds groups within a univariate response by building a decision tree from a set of predictor variables. The flexible structure of a CART model allow it to be used for either discriminate or regression analysis whilst also catering for mixed types within the predictor set. The goal of this thesis to develop methods that extend CART for a multivariate response dataset involving mixed data types. Multivariate regression for CART (MRT) has recently been shown to be a powerful profiling and clustering tool. However the same successes in extending CART for multivariate classification and multivariate mixed type analysis is yet to be realised. To begin with thesis explores simple extensions to CART for multivariate mixed type analysis. These are <b>binary</b> <b>substitution</b> of categorical variables within the response set and partitioning of a distance matrix using Db-MRT. These techniques use already existing extensions to CART methods and are used as comparison methods to gauge the performance of the ensemble and consensus approaches that are the focus of this thesis. Ensemble models using CART, such as random forests and treeboost, not only improve the overall accuracy of the model predictions but also introduce an ensemble proximity matrix as a measure of similarity between observations of the response set. In this thesis, through MRT, extensions to both random forests and treeboost are developed such that they predict a multivariate response. Furthermore, by <b>binary</b> <b>substitution</b> of the categorical variables within the response set these multivariate ensemble techniques are further extended to mixed type profiling. A result of this extension is that the ensemble proximity matrix now describes the groups found within the multivariate response. In this way multivariate tree-base ensembles can be interpreted as a cluster ensemble method, where the ensemble proximity matrices can be seen as cluster ensemble consensus matrices. In this thesis these proximity matrices are found to be powerful visualisation tools providing improved resolution of group structure found by a multivariate ensemble method. More so, as in cluster ensembles using these matrices as an input in to a clustering method improves the accuracy of the groups found. The main work of this thesis is the development of the Multivariate Consensus Tree (MCT) framework for mixed type profiling. Motivating the MCT approach is the need to further understand which variables relate to the groups observed within the proximity matrix. To do this MCTs describe three methods to intelligently combine the ensemble proximity matrices of individual responses into one overall consensus matrix. This consensus matrix is a summary of the overall group structure within each individual proximity matrix. As MCTs work solely with proximity matrices they are independent of the data types within the variables of the response set. Furthermore as each response variable is explicitly predicted it is possible to assess the quality of each proximity matrix in terms of predictive accuracy of the corresponding ensemble. The MCT consensus matrix is a visualisation tool for the groups present within both the response and predictor datasets. As a consensus matrix is a similarity matrix this thesis proposes five new splitting criteria for tree-based models that search for decision rules within variables of the predictor set that partition the consensus matrix into the observed groups. This tree provides a logical decision path that predicts each group. As the groups within the response are now defined by their relationships within the predictor set, the MCT profiling is complete. This thesis proposes two algorithms for building an MCT; global MCTs and local MCTs. Global MCTs construct an overall consensus matrix spanning all observations, and recursively partition on this matrix to build the tree. Local MCTs build a new consensus matrix at each terminal node to evaluate each new split. As MCTs have the proximity matrices to summarise the group structure within each response variable methods to identify important subgroups within these variables are also proposed. This search for subgroups within the response can be done on two levels. Firstly to identify subgroups of response variables for overall analysis; and secondly to identify subsets of response variables within any specific group found by the MCT. By finding subsets of response variables that relate to specific group structure the understanding of structure within the dataset is greatly improved. This thesis shows tree-based methods for profiling, in particular MCTs, to be a powerful tool for mixed type analysis. Firstly, the visualisation of the tree, combined with the proximity matrices, provide a unique view of the groups found and allow for their easy interpretation {{within the context of the}} analysis. Secondly, MCTs are shown to accurately estimate the number of groups and provide measures on their stability and accuracy. Furthermore, MCTs are found to be resistant to noise variables within the analysis. Finally they provide methods to find subgroups within the response variables and to identify unimportant variables from the analysis. Throughout this thesis these tree-based methods are compared with standard clustering techniques to provide an accurate benchmark for their performance. ...|$|E

Binary skutterudites, with single and multiple fillers, have been intensively studied in recent years. Compared to binary skutterudites, the ternary systems have received less attention, e. g. Ni 4 Sb 8 Sn 4. Ternary skutterudites are isoelectronic variants of <b>binary</b> skutterudites; cation <b>substitutions</b> appear to be isostructural to their binary analogues.

Skutterudite formation was not achieved in the Ni 4 Bi 8 Ge 4 and Ni 4 Sb 8 Ge 4 systems; skutterudite formation occurred in Ni 4 Sb 8 Sn 4 system.

40|$|Background: In {{observational}} studies, {{analyses of}} blood pressure (BP) typically require some correction {{for the use}} of antihypertensive medications by study participants. Different approaches to correcting for treatment have been compared, but the impact of pharmacogenetic interactions that influence the efficacy of antihypertensive treatments on estimates of genetic main effects has not been considered. This work demonstrates the potential influence of pharmacogenetic interactions in genetic analyses of BP. Methods: A simulation study is conducted to test the influence of pharmacogenetic interactions on approaches to the analysis of BP. Results from three plausible scenarios are presented. Results: Informative BP approaches (Fixed Treatment Effect, Non-parametric adjustment, Censored Normal Regression) perform well when there is no pharmacogenetic interaction, but yield biased estimates of the main effects of particular genetic variants when pharmacogenetic interactions exist. <b>Substitution</b> approaches (<b>Binary</b> Trait, Fixed <b>Substitution,</b> Random Substitution, Median Method) are unaffected by pharmacogenetic interactions, but consistently perform sub-optimally. Conclusions: We recommend that the Informative BP approaches remain the most appropriate methods to use in practice, but stress that caution is required in the interpretation of their results-especially when an interaction between treatment and a genetic variant of interest is suspected. We make some suggestions as to how to check for possible interactions and confirm the results from genetic analyses of BP, but warn that these should be reviewed when data on real pharmacogenetic interactions become available.
