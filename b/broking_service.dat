40|$|We {{introduce}} a new high-frequency foreign exchange dataset from EBS (Electronic <b>Broking</b> <b>Service)</b> that includes trading volume in the global interdealer spot market, data not previously available to researchers. The data also gives live transactable quotes, rather than the indicative quotes {{that have been used}} in most previous high frequency foreign exchange analysis. We describe intraday volume and volatility patterns in euro-dollar and dollar-yen trading. We study the effects of scheduled U. S. macroeconomic data releases, first confirming the finding of recent literature that the conditional mean of the exchange rate responds very quickly to the unexpected component of data releases. We next study the effects of data releases on trading volumes. News releases cause volume to rise, and to remain elevated for a longer period. However, in contrast to the result for the level of the exchange rate, even if the data release is entirely in line with expectations, we find that there is still typically a large pickup in trading volume.

40|$|Using a {{sophisticated}} {{tool of the}} Periodic-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (P-GARCH) model, this article investigates the market institutional effects of the determining role of trading activities and exchange rate volatility on the intraday behaviour of the 15 -minute JPY/USD exchange rate bid-ask spreads in the Electronic <b>Broking</b> <b>Service</b> (EBS) of electronic brokerage market for the period from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2005. We find that the exchange rate volatility both significantly and positively affects the bid-ask spreads, {{while the number of}} deals and quotation changes negatively affect the bid-ask spreads. These results {{are similar to those of}} past studies. We also find that a U-shaped pattern exists in the Tokyo trading hours and an inverted U-shaped pattern in the London trading hours, in addition to a round clock inverted U-shaped pattern of spread volatility. This inverted U-shaped pattern may be caused by unexpected news arrivals. The spread behaviour of the EBS global electronic broking market is not different from that of other electronic interdealer quotation markets and electronic broking markets. ...|$|E

40|$|The large {{diffusion}} of e-learning technologies represents {{a great opportunity}} for underserved segments of population. This is particularly true for people with disabilities for whom digital barriers should be overstepped with the aim of reengaging them back into society to education. In essence, before a mass of learners can be engaged in a collective educational process, each single member should be put in the position to enjoy accessible and customized educational experiences, regardless of the wide diversity of their personal characteristics and technological equipment. To respond to this demand, we developed LOT (Learning Object Transcoder), a distributed PHP-based serviceoriented system designed to deliver flexible and customized educational services for a multitude of learners, each with his/her own diverse preferences and needs. The main novelty of LOT amounts to a <b>broking</b> <b>service</b> able to manage the transcoding activities needed to convert multimedia digital material into the form which better fits a given student profile. Transcoding activities are performed based on the use of Web service technologies. Experimental results gathered from several field trials with LOT (available online a...|$|E
40|$|The {{absence of}} data has, until now, precluded {{virtually}} all research on trading volume {{in the foreign}} exchange market. This paper introduces a new high-frequency foreign exchange dataset from EBS (Electronic <b>Broking</b> <b>Service)</b> that includes trading volume in the global interdealer spot market. The dataset gives volumes and prices at the one-minute frequency over a five-year time period in the euro-dollar and dollar-yen currency pairs. We first document intraday volume patterns in euro-dollar and dollar-yen trading, noting the effects of macroeconomic news announcements but also purely institutional factors. We {{study the effects of}} UK-specific holidays on euro-dollar and dollar-yen trading volume and find that these holidays cause a sharp decline in trading volume even among dealers outside the UK, a natural experiment that we interpret as further evidence that trading activity is not driven solely by the flow of news about fundamentals. Studying the reaction to U. S. macroeconomic announcements, we show that a sharp pickup in trading volume generally occurs in the minutes following news announcements. This rise in trading volume happens even if the data release is entirely in line with market expectations, and it is often negatively related to the dispersion of ex-ante market expectations. Finally, focusing on one particular data release at the one-second frequency, we document a two-stage reaction whereby the price jumps immediately after the announcement without much trading volume, while trading volume and volatility then surge about 15 seconds after the data release.
