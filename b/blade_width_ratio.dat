40|$|Abstract. For a {{centrifugal}} fan impeller the blade shape {{can be defined}} using two parameters: the blade angle and the <b>blade</b> <b>width.</b> There are different design methods depending on the assumption made on both the <b>blade</b> <b>width</b> and the <b>blade</b> angle. In this paper four design methods are presented: constant <b>blade</b> <b>width</b> and variable <b>blade</b> angle; hyperbolic <b>blade</b> <b>width</b> and variable <b>blade</b> angle; hyperbolic <b>blade</b> <b>width</b> and constant <b>blade</b> angle; linear <b>blade</b> <b>width</b> and variable <b>blade</b> angle. The sequential algorithm for solving the characteristic system of equations, which defines the blade geometry, is implemented in a MATLAB script file, for which principal code lines are explained. In the solving process of the characteristic system of equations for all four design methods considered, different relationships for relative velocity are obtained. The comparative graphical analysis of impeller blades obtained {{by all of the}} four design methods, as well as the blade geometry parameters is presented...|$|R

Furcation entrance dimensions equal to or less than 0. 75 mm (the <b>blade</b> <b>width</b> of a new Gracey curet being 0. 76 mm) in maxillary first molars were found in 79 % of buccal entrances, 39 % of mesial entrances, and 43 % of distal entrances.

40|$|Hibbertia Andrews (Dilleniaceae) {{has been}} studied for 200 years, but the {{systematics}} of species from SE Australia have not been addressed. Many of the taxa placed into 16 informal groups by Toelken are undescribed and their phylogenetic relationships are unknown. Therefore, a comprehensive morphological and molecular phylogenetic analysis of 87 SE Australian taxa within Hibbertia subg. Hemistemma was conducted. Morphological {{studies were carried out}} including vegetative, indumentum, floral and leaf cuticular characters to assess intra-specific variation, determine any major lineages and taxon boundaries as well as to explore character evolution. Nuclear rDNA (ITS) and intergenic spacer regions of cpDNA (trnL-F) were amplified and the results compared and combined with morphological phylogenetic analysis. The results, all the 16 informal species groups proposed by Toelken were placed instead into eight clades, with strong support for different species pairs and sister relationships. Most infrataxa within more variable species were not part of monophyletic lineages and none of the 16 informal species groups of Toelken were supported. Vegetative, floral and leaf cuticular characters were important in understanding species of Hibbertia phylogenetic relationships, with general variation in numerous morphological characters such as hair type and density, androecium and gynoecium characteristics, stomata (shape and size), anticlinal and periclinal cell walls and trichome bases. The molecular data and combined data analysis enabled us to recognise eight clade, most with low support, with different groups of closely related taxa received strong support. Several infrataxa within more variable species did not form monophyletic lineages.

Eyes with an optic cup area of <  0. 2  mm 2 were excluded.  RESULTS—In the normal subjects, inferior to temporal rim <b>width</b> <b>ratio</b> (1. 67  (SD 0. 53)) was significantly (p< 0. 0001) higher than superior to temporal rim <b>width</b> <b>ratio</b> (1. 56  (0. 49)). Both ratios were significantly (p< 0. 0001) higher the more vertically the optic disc was configured. In the normal eyes, both ratios were statistically independent of disc size, rim area, refractive error, age, and sex. With the differences being more marked for the inferior to temporal ratio than for the superior to temporal <b>ratio,</b> both rim <b>width</b> <b>ratios</b> were significantly (p< 0. 005) lower in the ocular hypertensive group than in the normal group. Despite the high significance of the differences, diagnostic power of the inferior ratio and the superior ratio was 59 % and 58 %, respectively, indicating a marked overlap between the groups.  CONCLUSIONS—Abnormally low inferior to temporal and superior to temporal rim <b>width</b> <b>ratios</b> can indicate glaucomatous optic nerve damage in some ocular hypertensive eyes. Being independent of optic disc size and ocular magnification, the rim <b>width</b> <b>ratios</b> may be taken as one among other variables for the ophthalmoscopic optic disc evaluation, taking into account, however, a pronounced overlap between normal eyes and ocular hypertensive eyes.    Keywords: neuroretinal rim width ratios; glaucoma; ocular hypertensio...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the factors which influence the changes of lower third molars' angulation and space/crown <b>width</b> <b>ratio</b> by orthodontic treatment. METHODS: Pretreatment and posttreatment panoramic radiographs of 120 orthodontically treated cases were taken. The lower third molars' angulation and space/crown <b>width</b> <b>ratio</b> were examined {{and the relative}} factors on changes were analyzed. RESULTS: (1) The changes of the lower third molars' angulation and space/crown <b>width</b> <b>ratio</b> after orthodontic treatment were quite different among the cases. (2) The factors which influenced these changes mainly included extraction, mandibular plane angle, angulation and space/crown <b>width</b> <b>ratio</b> of lower third molar before orthodontic treatment. (3) Extraction was the most significantly variable associated with lower third molars' upright (angulation < 30 degree) after orthodontic treatment. CONCLUSION: Orthodontic extraction is helpful to upright the lower third molars and to increase the space for third molars; and the pre-treatment lower third molars' angulation and space/crown <b>width</b> <b>ratio</b> are important variables for the changes after treatment; cases with lower mandibular plane angle are apt to greater possibility for the lower third molars' upright. 目的：研究影响口腔正畸患者治疗前、后下颌第三磨牙状态改变的因素。方法：利用正畸治疗前、后的全口曲面断层片,测量 120 例正畸患者的 120 颗下颌第三磨牙[男 37 例,女 83 例,年龄在 1024 岁,平均（ 14. 1 ± 3. 3 ）岁]前倾角度和间隙/宽度比值的改变,统计分析影响正畸治疗前、后改变的因素。结果：（ 1 ）正畸治疗前、后下颌第三磨牙前倾角度和间隙/宽度比值的改变个体差别较大;（ 2 ）影响正畸治疗前、后下颌第三磨牙前倾角度和间隙/宽度比值改变的因素主要有拔牙、下颌平面角、治疗前的前倾角度和间隙/宽度比值（P〈 0. 05 ）,而骨龄和牙龄等因素对下颌第三磨牙状态的影响差异无统计学意义;（ 3 ）Logistic回归分析,进入治疗后下颌第三磨牙前倾角度是否〈 30 °判别方程的因素有拔牙、下颌平面角和治疗前的前倾角度,其中拔牙状况影响程度较大,拔牙使得治疗后的前倾角度〈 30 °（直立倾向）的可能性更大,是不拔牙的 4. 210 倍。结论：正畸拔牙治疗有助于下颌第三磨牙的直立,并使其萌出间隙增大;第三磨牙治疗前的状况（前倾角度和间隙/宽度比值）也是影响治疗后改变的重要因素;下颌平面角度小的患者预后下颌第三磨牙直立的可能性增加。link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The Golden proportion (62 %) and the recurring esthetic dental proportion (RED) are two theories in this field that have been suggested to create harmony among anterior teeth. These have rarely been studied among the Iranian population. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the Golden proportion and RED proportion in students, staff, and patients of Shahed dental school. Patients and Methods: This study was conducted with 116 subjects in Shahed dental school photographs of the subject’s anterior teeth were taken from the frontal view. The perceived <b>width</b> <b>ratios</b> of canine to lateral incisor and lateral incisor to central incisor were calculated. In this study, the Golden proportion was evaluated within the range of 0. 55 – 0. 64. To evaluate the existence of the RED proportion in each subject, the <b>width</b> <b>ratio</b> of canine to lateral incisor was compared with the <b>width</b> <b>ratio</b> of lateral incisor to central incisor.

Elastic upscaling allows layering on a fine length scale {{to be replaced}} by thicker, homogeneous equivalent transversely isotropic layers, thus creating a model with far fewer layers. In this paper, the eVect of inclusions of finite lateral extent on elastic upscaling is examined. For inclusions with a small thickness to <b>width</b> <b>ratio,</b> Backus averaging gives a good approximation to the long-wavelength elastic properties of the medium. However, for larger thickness to <b>width</b> <b>ratios,</b> the anisotropy of the medium can be significantly reduced. For inclusions that are long in comparison to their width, azimuthal anisotropy may result if the inclusions show a preferential orientation. This could result from the presence of flow during deposition. The azimuthal anisotropy increases with increasing thickness to <b>width</b> <b>ratio</b> of the inclusions, and vanishes when this ratio is zero. For larger thickness to <b>width</b> <b>ratios,</b> the magnitude of the azimuthal anisotropy may be of similar magnitude to that commonly seen in sedimentary basins. Azimuthal anisotropy is usually attributed to the presence of aligned fractures within the formation. The present results suggest a further source of azimuthal anisotropy that may be significant.
