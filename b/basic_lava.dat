2500|$|Interpretation of {{the origin}} of the smooth plains is {{difficult}} but significant, because it bears directly on the internal constitution and thermal history of Mercury. Like the lunar maria, the smooth plains occur on the floors of large craters and basins, and the broad swath of plains around Caloris finds an analogy with Oceanus Procellarum around Imbrium on the Moon. However, the Caloris plains differ from the maria in having no observed positive-relief volcanic features such as those sparsely scattered on the lunar maria. The absence of sharp albedo differences between the smooth plains and the older terrain (Hapke and others, 1975), compared with the distinct difference in albedo between the lunar maria and highlands, may be more indicative of composition than of origin of the rocks. On the basis of distribution and volume, Strom and others argued that in most areas the smooth plains consist of extensive sheets of <b>basic</b> <b>lava</b> similar to the lunar maria. Schultz (1977), studying modified impact craters, also argued in favor of volcanism. On the other hand, Wilhelms pointed out that the lunar light plains could also serve as an analog of the mercurian smooth plains: Apollo 16 samples indicate that lunar light plains consist of cataclastic breccia and impact melt, interpreted as being emplaced by large impact events (James, 1977). Wilhelms, therefore, proposed that the smooth plains on Mercury {{may be related to the}} Caloris impact directly, as breccias and impact melts, rather than as lavas. However, the light plains on the Moon are nowhere so well developed or extensive as the plains around Caloris, and if Wilhelms’ explanation is correct, considerable differences must exist between large impact events on the Moon and Mercury.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} the petrology of the Mellid area, the SE {{portion of the}} outer zone of the Ordenes Complex {{which is one of}} the upthrusted Precambrian complexes in the axial zone of the Hercynian orogen in Galicia, NW Spain. An eugeosynclinal rock sequence is found containing units with different metamorphic evolutions. All units were affected by Precambrian tectonization and retrogressive metamorphism. This orogeny may be subdivided into three metamorphic and four deformation phases which caused definite changes in the mineralogical composition and the texture of the rock. The sequence of metamorphic phases, established in a granulite facies unit is as follows: the first phase of Precambrian metamorphism is characterized by the (hornblende-) granulite facies, more precisely the (hornblende-) clinopyroxene-garnet-sodic plagioclase subfacies of the kyanite-bearing granulite facies. At that time, PH 2 O must have been very low locally. The second and third phases were marked by the hornblende-clinopyroxene-garnet-sodic plagioclase subfacies and the amphibolite facies, respectively. The other units bear witness to lower grade metamorphic activities. The granulite facies unit comprises metamorphosed <b>basic</b> <b>lavas,</b> metapelitic rocks, garnet-bearing metagabbros and garnet-bearing peridotites. The metapelitic rocks (kyanite-garnet-orthoclase-sodic plagioclase-biotite) and the metamorphosed <b>basic</b> <b>lavas</b> (clinopyroxenegarnet-sodic plagioclase-amphibole) are described in detail. The latter rocks contain Ca-rich inclusions, displaying scapolite-bearing mineral assemblages. The inclusions can be ascribed to deuteric alteration or incipient metamorphism in the <b>basic</b> <b>lavas</b> prior to the granulite facies metamorphism. The other units contain metasedimentary rocks and granitic and granodioritic orthogneisses. Metamorphic conditions during the Hercynian orogeny did not go further than the lower amphibolite facies. Therefore, retrogradation of the Precambrian units continued but a clear conversion of the rock texture cannot be discerned. The most important Hercynian event in the Mellid area was the emplacement of an ophiolitic rock suite...|$|R

The state area, barring the extreme eastern Vidarbha region, parts of Kolhapur and Sindhudurg, is practically co-terminous with the Deccan Traps. Roughly 60 to 90 million years ago, the outpouring of <b>basic</b> <b>lava</b> through fissures formed horizontally bedded basalt over large areas. Variations in their composition and structure have resulted in massive, well-jointed steel-grey cliff faces alternating with structural benches of vesicular amygdaloid lava and ash layers, all of which contribute to the pyramida-shaped hills and crest-level plateaux or mesas. Earth sculpturing under the tropical climate completed the panorama-sharply defining the landform features in the semi-arid conditions, and rounding the hilltops under water condition. Fluvial action by the Krishna, Bhima, Godavari, Tapi-Purna and Wardha-Wainganga river systems has further aided in the compartmentalisation of the Desh into broad, open river valleys, alternating with plateau interfluves, that form the ribs of the Sahyadrian backbone.

40|$|Archaean {{rocks of}} the area make up three depositional series which are {{separated}} in time one from another by periods of folding.

During the folding, regional metamorphism to the greenschist and amphibolite facies and intrusion of gabbro and ultrabasic rock, took place. The medium-aged rocks were deposited in a broad geosyncline which deepened to the north. In the central parts {{of the area}}, shelf facies deposits consist of <b>basic</b> <b>lavas</b> overlain by felsic agglomerate and coarse clastic sediments, but northward these rocks give way to uniformly banded fine clastic sediments deposited in a deeper sea environment. During the later stages of volcanism and sedimentation the rocks were folded synchronously along north-south and approximately east-west lines and metamorphism to greenschist and amphibolite facies took place. Domal structures controlled the locations of volcanic centres, igneous intrusion, and orebodies. The youngest group of rocks, which occurs in the northwestern area, was folded along dominantly east-west lines. Metamorphism of the original sedimentary rocks to gneisses of the high amphibolite facies may have taken place at this time. Faulting and the related intrusion of diabase dykes along north-south, northeasterly and northwesterly lines took place as uplift occurred in the northern areas during Proterozoic time.

Due to the greater depth at which asthenospheric magmas are derived, mixing occurs between the alkali basaltic and the olivine tholeiitic magmas during ascent through the lithosphere.

Geological, petrographical, chemical and U-Pb geochronological data suggest three distinct volcanic episodes: (1) an Early Ordovician episode, (475, 00 Ma; U-Pb standard determinations on zircons), consisting of intermediate to acid calcalkaline volcanics, presumably related to an ancient active continental margin/volcanic arc setting; (2) a Middle Devonian episode (387 +/- 2 Ma; U-Pb standard determinations on zircons), with calcalkaline acid products of orogenic affinity; (3) a Devonian(?) -Early Carboniferous (?) episode, consisting of within-plate alkaline basalts (WPB), derived from a depleted upper mantle source.

Thus, this study describes {{for the first time}} morphological aspects of lava flows and structural characteristics caused by lava-sediment interaction in the northwestern PCFB province (NW-PCFB). Early Cretaceous (134 to 132 Ma) tholeiitic rocks of the PCFB were emplaced on a large intracratonic Paleozoic sedimentary basin (Parana Basin), mainly covering dry eolian sandstones (Botucatu Formation).

These flows have dispersed vesicles and sand-filled cracks in their base and top borders, as well as the presence of interlayered sandstones with irregular contacts and varied thicknesses.

The inner belt is divided into a Jurassic olistostrome known as the Tanba zone and a hinterland area comprising continental Triassic-Jurassic sediments. The Tanba zone is sliced into two units: a lower one with late Jurassic matrix and Triassic-early Jurassic radiolarite olistoliths, tectonically overthrust by an upper unit comprising an olistostrome with middle Jurassic matrix and blocks which include late Paleozoic limestone, <b>basic</b> <b>lava,</b> and radiolarite. The Tanba zone is overthrust by a Paleozoic nappe complex derived from the hinterland. The basal sole of the nappe corresponds to a peculiar unit called the ultra-Tanba zone. In the Chugoku area, the hinterland is divided into an upper nappe: the Oga nappe, formed by Permo-Carboniferous limestone and Permian clastic rocks and a lower one: the Sangun-Maizuru nappe, formed by Paleozoic high pressure (HP) metamorphics (the Sangun schists), the Permian Maizuru olistostrome, and the dismembered Paleozoic Yakuno ophiolites. In the northern part of SW Japan, the Tanba zone is in faulted contact with the circum-Hida and the Hida zones. The former is interpreted as the equivalent of the Oga and Sangun-Maizuru nappes of the Chugoku domain crushed by post Cretaceous tectonics. The latter consists of Paleozoic high temperature (HT) metamorphic rocks and late Triassic-early Jurassic granite, locally mylonitized and covered by early Jurassic sandstone. The outer belt is formed by a superficial nappe similar to the Tanba zone thrust upon a "deep domain" characterized by a synmetamorphic ductile deformation. The "deep domain" is divided into a lower unit, the Oboke unit formed by continental derived arenites and a Green Schist nappe consisting of oceanic sediments and resedimented ophiolites. The Green Schist nappe overthrusts the Oboke unit under synmetamorphic conditions with an eastward displacement.

[...] Intrusion of the pre-Middle Ordovician garnetiferous muscovite-biotite granites post-dated {{the development of the}} composite gneissic banding in the gneissic basement, and predated the first deformation of the Gander Group. A post Middle Ordovician (pre-Devonlan?) quartz diorite intruded the Gander Group, Davidsville Group and the melange. Evidence suggests that the quartz diorite intruded the Davidsville Group before the latter was penetratively deformed. [...] The ultramafic rooks of the Gander Group are composed dominantly of pyroxenite, minor chromite bearing serpentinites and talc-carbonate schists which were marginally metamorphosed, and have the same composite fabric as the enveloping metasedimentary rocks. They {{do not appear to be}} genetically related to the serpentinized dunite breccia, mafic pillow lavas and hornblende gabbros which were incorporated as blocks in the nearby melange belt separating the Gander and Davidsville Groups. The melange is considered tectonic, having been formed during the upthrusting of the Davidsville Group (onto the Gander Group) as a folded nappe. [...] Four main phases of deformation (each producing a fabric) are recognized in the Gander Group, and two other phases (one penetrative), which may or may not be related to those of the Gander Group, are recognized in the Davidsville Group. Evidence suggests that the third deformation of the Gander Group pre-dated the first deformation of the Davidsville Group. The main schistosity in the Gander Group is a second fabric, which has formed by transposition of an earlier one. Tight to isoclinal folds, boudins and interference patterns were produced during the second and third deformations of the Group. A major southwesterly plunging synform, and numerous minor folds were generated during the first deformation of the Davidsville Group. Kink bands and a series of faults offset the regional foliations and are believed to be developed after the main episodes of folding. [...] The climax of metamorphlsm in the Gander Group, occurred during the second phase of deformation, producing muscovite-biotite schists, actinolite schists, and amphibolites. A later thermal metamorphic event affected rocks of the Gander and Davidsville Groups...|$|E
40|$|The area {{discussed}} {{is in the}} Le Brun and Mint Canyon Quadrangle {{which in}} turn form {{the southwest corner of}} the Elizabeth Lake Quadrangle. This area lies about 45 miles north west of Los Angeles and comprises a part of Sierra Pelona Ridge, Sawmill and Jupiter Mountains. These mountains form a portion of the transverse ranges. The Pelona schists make up about two-thirds of the area, and are probably of Archeozoic age. A series of migmatite forming inclusions in the granitic country rock are probably of Pre-Cambrian age also. These old metamorphics were intruded during Jura-Cretaceous time by batholith whose average composition is that of a monzonite although different facies of it vary from dioritic to granitic. The Martinez formation was deposited in lowermost Eocene time and is made up of 9000 + feet of sandstones, shales and a few intercalated conglomerate beds. These are marine sediments. Between Martinez and Mint Canyon times a thick series of fanglomerates, sands, silts, and muds were laid down in local basins. These continental beds are red in color, and make up the Le Brun formation and Vasquez series. Although this series contains no lava in this area, it contains large thicknesses of <b>basic</b> <b>lava</b> south and east of this locality. The Mint Canyon formation is also continental in origin and lies on the truncated edges of the Vasquez series. It is composed of a basal conglomerate overlain by well bedded sandstones and shales. Terrace materials of two different ages can be recognized. In addition {{there is reason to believe}} that this region was pen plained toward the end of Pliocene time. The strata of the above formations strike east-west or slightly southwest-northeast, and with the exception of the Mint Canyon formation they dip very steeply, in places standing vertical. The foliation of the metamorphic rock also has the same general strike end steep dip of the sediments. The Mint Canyon beds dip off relatively gently to the south. Faulting has been very active in this region and has taken place from middle Miocene time, or perhaps earlier, to the recent. The San Andreas Rift, which passes along just to the north of this area, provides the key to the structural history of the region. Adjacent to the San Andreas Rift large wedges of basement complex shoved up and over the Martinez formation and the Pelona schist, while the faults south of Sierra Pelona Ridge are of the normal type they are not tensional, but compressional faults due to the large horizontal displacement which has taken place along them. Compressional effects such as these are typical along the San Andreas Rift. Folding has played but a minor role in this area. South of the Sierra Pelona Ridge, long slim wedges of igneous and metamorphic rock have been faulted into the Vasquez series; these horses are found sometimes half a mile from the nearest outcrop of igneous or metamorphic rock...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{of an area}} fringing the Namib Desert in southern South West Africa {{has led to the}} clarification of relationships between several geological units of the Late Precambrian Sinclair Group, and to the formulation of a petrogenetic scheme and geotectonic model of evolution. In the area studied, the oldest exposed unit of the Group is the hybrid and heterogeneous Haremub granite which is overlain by the predominantly arkosic Kunjas Formation. This is followed conformably by the Barby Formation, consisting predominantly of <b>basic</b> and felsic <b>lava</b> flows and various volcaniclastic beds including ash-flow tuff deposits. <b>Basic</b> <b>lavas</b> constitute the bulk of the succession and are typically highly porphyritic. A preliminary 'member' subdivision of the Barby sequence is suggested, based mainly on easily-recognisable field and petrographic characteristics. Gabbroic and noritic intrusives in the southwestern part of the area relate to the Barby basic magmatic phase. The following en bloc emplacement of the northwesterly elongated body of Spes Bona syenite was accompanied by intrusion of monzonitic and dioritic magma along fracture zones marginal to the syenite. The emplacement into high crustal levels of large volumes of the porphyritic/granophyric Nubib granite (1360 ± 50 Ma) took place within a major northwest trending zone of crustal weakness which also marked the site of the developing Nam Shear Belt. This shearing imposed a strong but localised mylonitic imprint on all but the youngest intrusions of Nubib granite and on the Barby <b>basic</b> <b>lavas</b> invaded by the granite. Post-dating the Nubib granite and the main phase of shearing is the mixed sedimentary-volcanic Guperas Formation. Deposition took place mainly within a prominent north-south trending graben structure, and volcanic activity was apparently most intense in three fairly distinct centres. Ashflows and felsic lavas were extruded from vents, now preserved as plug-like bodies. The intrusion of dense composite swarms of. basic and felsic dykes took place {{toward the end of the}} Guperas phase. The Rooiberg granite (± 1270 Ma) is intrusive into the Guperas. The Auborus Formation, comprising about 2, 600 m of red felspathic sandstone and conglomerate represents the youngest unit in the evolution of the Sinclair Group. It is preserved in prominent north-south trending graben structures. It has been possible to postulate distinct parent magma types on the basis of major and trace element analyses carried out on sixty-seven samples from the Sinclair Group. The felsic rock-types can be differentiated into a relatively high-Ca group and a relatively low-Ca group, the latter being domi-. nant. The basic rock-types comprise both tholeiitic and calc-alkaline types and the latter are characteristically rich in potassium and associated elements, and have been classed as 'shoshonites'. There exists no direct genetic relationship between the basic and felsic rock-types...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. A {{trachyte}} plug near Jos {{contains a}} suite of inclusions, commonly rounded and of large size, including olivine nodules, pyroxenites, {{and a variety of}} basic to intermediate plutonic rocks, as well as albite megacrysts. The olivine nodules are typical of those found elsewhere in alkaline <b>basic</b> <b>lavas</b> and widely in-terpreted as upper mantle fragments. Most of the other inclusions contain evidence of crystallization at high pressures, even the syenites, which are interpreted as plutonic equivalents of the trachyte; for the feldspar in them is sanidine-microperthite. Discovery of this inclusion assemblage in a trachyte provides further support for the thesis that alkaline salic lavas can be generated at sub-crustal depths, by partial melting beneath domically uplifted continental shield areas (Bailey, I 964). The Nigerian Cenozoic volcanic province lies in an area of regional uplift, and is characterized by scattered small volcanic entres rather than by major eruptive foci. High pressure inclusions are being found at an increasing proportion of these centres, suggesting that the magmas rose directly and rapidly to the surface from the upper mantle levels at which they were all (including the trachyte) generated...|$|R

40|$|A investigação foi realizada no extremo sul do Brasil, nos derrames básicos da Formação Serra Geral, entre os municípios de Santa Cruz do Sul-Herveiras e Lajeado. Na área estão expostas sucessões de derrames baixo Ti com morfologias pahoehoe e rubbly, pertencentes a Província Ígnea Paraná-Etendeka. Na sequência de derrames em Santa Cruz do Sul-Herveiras foram identificadas 16 litofácies e três associações de litofácies 1 - pahoehoe composta inicial, 2 - pahoehoe simples inicial e 3 - rubbly simples tardia. Nos derrames pahoehoe compostos (30 m espessura), apenas vesículas tipo V 1 e gigantes são preservadas. Estudos petrográficos indicaram que os processos de dissolução de cristais e liberação de gás originaram porosidades primárias, enquanto processos de alteração e fraturamento geraram uma grande quantidade de porosidades secundárias. No entanto, a precipitação de minerais secundários nos poros tende a reduzir o espaço disponível para armazenamento de fluidos, demonstrando que apenas a existência de poros é insuficiente para a existência de um reservatório vulcânico. Geoquimicamente, todos os derrames estudados podem ser classificados como do tipo Gramado. As composições variam de basaltos a andesito basálticos de afinidade toleítica nos perfis Santa Cruz e Lajeado, enquanto na área do Morro da Cruz, os derrames do tipo ponded pahoehoe exibem composições de andesitos. A assimilação crustal sugerida para estas sequências vulcânicas permite explicar as altas razões isotópicas iniciais de Sr (0, 707798 – 0, 715751), e os valores baixos de Nd (- 8, 36 a - 5, 41), com associadas variações isotópicas de Pb (18, 42 30 m thickness), just V 1 -type {{and giant}} vesicles are preserved. Petrographic studies {{indicate}} that the dissolution of deuteric crystals and gas releasing processes formed the primary porosities, while processes such as alteration and fracturing generated the secondary porosities. However, the precipitation of secondary minerals in vesicles and cavities decreases the available space for fluid storage, which suggest {{that the existence of}} pores alone is insufficient for creating volcanic reservoirs. Geochemically, all the studied lava flows could be classified in the Gramado type. The geochemical compositions in the Santa Cruz do Sul-Herveiras and Lajeado profiles range from basalt to basaltic andesites with tholeiitic affinity, while in the Morro da Cruz area, the ponded pahoehoe lava flows exhibit andesite compositions. The process of crustal assimilation suggested for these volcanic sequences allow explains the high and widespread initial Sr isotopic ratios at 0. 707798 – 0. 715751 and the low εNd at − 8. 36 to − 5. 41, with associated Pb isotopic variations (18. 42 < 206 Pb/ 204 Pb < 18. 86; 15. 65 < 207 Pb/ 204 Pb < 15. 71; 38. 62 < 208 Pb/ 204 Pb < 39. 37). The magmatic evolution of the SCSH and LJ <b>basic</b> <b>lava</b> flows begins with the storage of mafic liquids during a short period at shallow-level magma chamber, associated to significant crustal contamination that allowed the magma ascent with composition of olivine basalts that exhibit compound pahoehoe morphology at surface. The continuous fractional crystallization within the magma chamber coupled with variable assimilation degrees of distinct contaminants with Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic ages, in addition to significant contribution of magma recharge led to magma ascent with basaltic andesite composition that display at surface the simple pahoehoe morphology. The continuous magma recharge in the magma chamber coupled with higher assimilation degree allowed the formation of basaltic andesite lavas with more contaminated isotopic signatures that exhibit rubbly morphology at the surface. Differentiation process of liquids coupled with the highest assimilation degrees of distinct contaminants during longer time in a shallow-level magma chamber, which is distinct from that where SCSH and LJ magmas have been stored, led to formation of andesites of the Morro da Cruz that exhibit the most contaminated isotopic signatures of south hinge of the Torres Syncline...|$|E
30|$|It is {{unnecessary}} {{to say that}} the quality of water is the most significant concerns of human health, especially in arid environment (Al-Omran et al. 2012). Sometime, humans have to use water contaminated by disease vectors, pathogens, or improper concentrations of toxins (William and Frank 2000). Using this water may lead to various diseases and sometimes death. Monitoring drinking groundwater is essential to confirm its safety (USEPA 2007). The hydrochemical and microbial analyses of groundwater have a substantial role in assessing water quality (Tiwari 2011). Countless people drink Zamzam groundwater in Saudi Arabia (Shomar 2012). According to Arab historians, the Zamzam well has been in use for around 4000  years (Khalid et al. 2014). The major solute chemistry reveals that the water contains high concentration of calcium and its water type is calcium carbonate type. The water is alkaline and the distributions of major salts are: magnesium bicarbonate, magnesium sulfate, sodium and potassium chloride (Shomar 2012; Al-Gamal 2009). The long residence time with aquifer materials of <b>basic</b> <b>lava</b> origin (basalt) {{led to the formation of}} ferro-magnesium minerals, soluble calcium and magnesium, in water (Al-Gamal 2009). Shomar (2012) reported that the Zamzam water contains high concentration of As and NO 3 and set above permission limit of WHO; on the other hand, Al Nouri et al. (2014) reported that the Zamzam water is free of As contaminations and its concentration sets within permissible limits according to WHO (2011) and SASO (1984). Griffin et al. (2007) reported that the Zamzam water contains high concentration of Fluoride and some other element. Mashat (2010) reported that the Zamzam water has no sign of biological growth due to it is naturally pure and salt-sterilized contents. In 1971, the ministry of agriculture and water resources sent Zamzam water samples to the European laboratories to test its potability. The results indicated that the water can be considered suitable for drinking; nevertheless, it contains slightly high concentration of fluoride, calcium, and magnesium (The annual report of the ministry of agriculture and water resources 1971). Calcium and magnesium in water and food are known to have antitoxic activity. They can help prevent the absorption of some toxic elements such as lead and cadmium from the intestine into the blood, either via direct reaction leading to formation of a non-absorbable compound or via competition for binding sites (Kozisek 2004). In addition, the WHO (1980) concluded that the populations supplied with low-mineral water may be at a higher risk in terms of adverse effects from exposure to toxic substances compared to populations supplied with water containing adequate mineral and hardness. Furthermore, the low mineral water and low TDS may cause salts to be leached from the human body. Shomar (2012) reported that the top 14  m of the Zamzam well is excavated in the sandy alluvium of the Wadi Ibrahim; however, the lower 17  m is located in the diorite bedrock. A 0.5 -m-thick highly permeable weathered rock located between the alluvium and bedrock was observed. Most of the alluvial section of the well is lined with stone except for the uppermost 1  m, which has a reinforced concrete collar. The water enters to Zamzam well from alluvial section and at depth 13  m from surface. In attempting to test the well flow rate, a pumping machine at 8000 L s− 1 was operated for more than 24  h. This test showed a decrease in the level of water by about 10  m and then the water level stopped receding. The water level recovered to its approximately original surface just after 11  min after pumping had stopped (ZSRC 2011). The aquifer feeding the Zamzam well appears to recharge from rock fractures in adjacent mountains around Mecca (Makkah). Therefore, the well taps groundwater primarily from the spring-fed alluvium and to a lesser extent from water percolating up through the permeable, weathered fresh bedrock (ZSRC 2011). This study aims to investigate the chemical and microbiological composition of Zamzam water, assess Zamzam waters for drinking purposes, and finally classify the hydrochemical characterization of Zamzam well.|$|E
40|$|Several hundred {{chemical}} analyses of early Proterozoic lavas of the Witwatersrand triad (incorporating the Dominion Group, Witwatersrand Supergroup and Ventersdorp Supergroup) in the Klerksdorp area, have revealed {{the presence of}} various distinct magma types. These essentially correspond to formally defined lithostratigraphic units, but several inconsistencies have necessitated the use of informal nomenclature. The lavas have been regionally metamorphosed to low-grade, greenschist facies assemblages. Original igneous textures are preserved, despite a metamorphic overprint. Metamorphism {{has resulted in a}} certain degree of random chemical remobilization. Ba, Sr, Rb, K₂ 0, Na₂ 0 and CaO have been highly mobile, and their usefulness in petrogenetic modelling is extremely limited. In contrast, Zr, Nb, Y, LREE's, Cr, Ni, Ti 0 ₂ P₂ 0 ₅ and Al₂ 0 ₃ have remained immobile. Ti/Zr and Ti/P ratios together constitute efficient discriminating variables for characterizing the different magma types. Lava compositions range from primitive Mg-rich tholeiites to rhyolites, the bulk being tholeiitic andesites. Al₂ 0 ₃ contents do not exceed 15 %, a feature which reflects the tholeiitic, as opposed to calcalkaline, character of these lavas. Two magma-types are present within the Dominion Group, which is a typical example of bimodal volcanism. The Dominion basic lavas are overlain by the Dominion acid porphyries, with a limited amount of interfingering. The <b>basic</b> <b>lava</b> suite is highly fractionated, with compositions ranging from Mg-, Cr- and Ni-rich tholeiites (close to primary mantle melts) to evolved tholeiitic andesites. The most primitive liquids evolved by 45 % fractional crystallization of hornblende, followed by a further 70 % crystallization of an orthopyroxene-plagioclase assemblage containing up to 3 % sulphides. The Dominion porphyries are rhyolitic, display very limited compositional variation, and probably represent a crustal melt related to the same magmatic event which produced the basic lavas. The only lavas from the Witwatersrand Supergroup present in the Klerksdorp area are those of the Crown Formation (Jeppestown amygdaloid). These are tholeiitic dacites which display extremely limited compositional variation, and are unrelated to any of the other magmas of the Witwatersrand triad. The Ventersdorp Supergroup comprises 4 magma-types: The Kliprivierberg Group lavas at the base are subdivisible into 3 sub-types on the basis of Zr contents. (Zr> 11 Oppm) are the most evolved. They are tholeiitic andesites which display fairly limited compositional variation. It is likely that more evolved compositions are present in other areas where the porphyritic lavas which characterize this unit are better developed. The overlying Orkney lavas are characterized by 110 ppm>Zr> 90 ppm. They are tholeiitic andesites of similar composition to the Alberton lavas, but have lower incompatible element levels, higher siderophile element levels, and are of extremely uniform composition. The uppermost Loraine/Edenville lavas range from magnesian tholeiites to tholeiitic andesites. They are distinguished by Zr< 90 ppm, and contain the most primitive magmas af the Witwatersrand triad, with up to 17, 5 % MgO, 2600 ppm Cr, 600 ppm Ni and M-values up to 77. The most primitive liquids evolved by 38 % fractional crystallization of orthopyroxene ∓ chromite, followed by 35 % fractional crystallization of an extract containing clinopyroxene and plagioclase. The absence of olivine precipitation {{is a result of the}} inherently high Si 0 ₂ content of the magma. The Loraine/Edenville, Orkney and Alberton lavas do not lie on a common liquid line of descent, but are probably consanguinous. The Platberg Group overlies the Kliprivierberg Group, and has a coarse-clastic sedimentary unit, the Kameeldoorns Formation, at the base. Three petrographically distinct porphyritic lava sequences overlie the Kameeldoorns Formation, namely the informal "Goedgenoeg formation", the Makwassie quartz-feldspar porphyries and the Rietgat Formation. Despite petrographic differences, the Goedgenoeg and Rietgat lavas are chemically indistinguishable and thus form a single magma-type. The Makwassie porphyries are dacitic in composition with a high proportion of feldspar and quartz phenocrysts. Rational variation trends are attributed to a nett loss of Si 0 ₂ during secondary alteration. The porphyries are probably of crustal origin. The Goedgenoeg/Rietgat lavas display unusual chemistry and a broad, irrational compositional spectrum. They contain very high incompatible element levels, high nonnative quartz, as well as high MgO, M-values, Cr and Ni relative to the other tholeiitic andesites of the Witwatersrand triad. It is tentatively suggested that they are hybrid magmas containing both crust and mantle components, the former possibly represented by the Makwassie porphyries. Field evidence suggests that Platberg volcanism commenced directly after Klipriviersberg volcanism ceased, and was accompanied by a period of enhanced tectonic activity. The Platberg lavas thus probably reflect a crustal melting cycle associated with the Klipriviersberg magmatic event. The Allanridge lavas are the youngest rocks of the Witwatersrand triad. They are separated from the Platberg Group by a unit of flat-lying sediments, the Bothaville Formation, which was deposited after an extended period of peneplanation. The Allanridge lavas form a separate magma-type. They are tholeiitic andesites of similar composition to the Alberton lavas, but have higher incompatible element levels and are not consanguinous. The compositional similarities amongst the basic magma-types of the Witwatersrand triad suggests that all were generated in an hydrous mantle. Interelement ratio differences between the various magma-types nevertheless support the concept that the mantle was chemically heterogeneous during the early Proterozoic...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEarly Cambrian and Mid–Late Neoproterozoic {{volcanic}} {{rocks in}} China are widespread on several Precambrian continental blocks, which had aggregated to {{form part of}} the Rodinia supercontinent by ca. 900  Ma. On the basis of petrogeochemical data, the <b>basic</b> <b>lavas</b> can be classified into two major magma types: HT (Ti/Y >  500) and LT (Ti/Y    0. 85) and HT 2 (Nb/La ≤  0. 85), and LT 1 (Nb/La >  0. 85) and LT 2 (Nb/La ≤  0. 85) subtypes, respectively.

These volcanics exhibit at least three characteristics: (1) most have a compositional bimodality; (2) they were formed in an intracontinental rift setting; and (3) they are genetically linked with mantle plumes or a mantle surperplume. This rift-related volcanism at end of the Mid–Neoproterozoic and Early Cambrian coincided temporally with the separation between Australia–East Antarctica, South China and Laurentia and between Australia and Tarim, respectively.
