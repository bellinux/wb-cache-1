50|$|One early form of <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> {{that was}} the first to be widely used for {{aircraft}} construction and repair was the Cherry friction-lock rivet. Originally, Cherry friction-locks were available in two styles, hollow shank pull-through and self-plugging types.

50|$|A rivet nut, {{also known}} as a <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> nut or {{threaded}} insert, is a one-piece internally threaded and counterbored tubular rivet that can be anchored entirely from one side. There are two types: one is designed to form a bulge on {{the back side of the}} panel as a screw is tightened in its threads. The other is similarly drawn in using a screw, but is drawn into the sleeve instead of creating a bulge.|$|E

50|$|Internally and {{externally}} locked structural <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> {{can be used}} in aircraft applications because, {{unlike other}} types of <b>blind</b> <b>rivets,</b> the locked mandrels cannot fall out and are watertight. Since the mandrel is locked into place, they have the same or greater load-carrying capacity as solid rivets and may be used to replace solid rivets on all but the most critical stressed aircraft structures.|$|R
50|$|A drive rivet {{is a form}} of <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> {{that has}} a short mandrel {{protruding}} from the head that is driven in with a hammer to flare out the end inserted in the hole. This is commonly used to rivet wood panels into place since the hole {{does not need to be}} drilled all the way through the panel, producing an aesthetically pleasing appearance. They can also be used with plastic, metal, and other materials and require no special setting tool other than a hammer and possibly a backing block (steel or some other dense material) placed behind the location of the rivet while hammering it into place. Drive rivets have less clamping force than most other rivets. Drive screws, possibly another name for drive rivets, are commonly used to hold nameplates into blind holes. They typically have spiral threads that grip the side of the hole.|$|E
40|$|A <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> nut is a {{mechanical}} fastener enabling a fast installation from one side. The setting process relies on plastic deformation due to axial compression of the rivet nut {{in such a}} way that a bulge is formed on the underside of the work piece. The mechanical performance of such a connection partly depends on the final geometry of the rivet nut after forming. In this contribution, the torque-to-turn resistance of an internally threaded round tubular rivet is studied with the aid of finite element techniques. A strategy is presented to simulate the setting process involving large plastic strains and contact pressures. An FE-based inverse method was used to identify the local plastic material properties of the <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> nut. The forming simulation was validated in terms of predicted shape of the rivet nut and the evolution of the setting force. A quasi-static FE model using the shape and solution variables of the deformed rivet nut was used to reproduce the torque-to-turn resistance as a function of the setting force. Finally, the aim is to apply the presented modelling strategy to explore innovative possibilities to increase the torque-to-turn resistance of a <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> nut. status: accepte...|$|E

The experiment itself, the experimental method and the evaluation of the test are described. Mechanism of riveted joint damage produced by galvanic corrosion is proposed. Considerable corrosion damage occurred at combination of the joint members and connected materials with different electrochemical potentials.

A method popularized by Chris Heintz of Zenith Aircraft uses a common flat-head (countersunk) rivet which is drawn into a specially machined nosepiece that forms it into a round head rivet, taking up much of the variation inherent in hole size found in amateur aircraft construction.

5000|$|<b>Blind</b> <b>rivets,</b> {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "pop" [...] rivets (POP is the brand name of the original manufacturer, now owned by Stanley Engineered Fastening, a division of Stanley Black & Decker) are tubular and are supplied with a mandrel through the center. The rivet assembly is inserted into a hole drilled through the parts to be joined and a specially designed tool is used to draw the mandrel into the rivet. This expands the blind end of the rivet and then the mandrel snaps off. These types of <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> have non-locking mandrels and are sometimes avoided for critical structural joints because the mandrels may fall out, due to vibration or other reasons, leaving a hollow rivet that has a lower load-carrying capability than solid rivets. Furthermore, because of the mandrel they are more prone to failure from corrosion and vibration. Unlike solid <b>rivets,</b> <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> can be inserted and fully installed in a joint from only one side of a part or structure, [...] "blind" [...] to the opposite side.|$|R

40|$|The steel {{thin-walled}} {{structures are}} widespread in civil and industrial engineering nowadays. Self-drilling screws or rivets {{are used to}} interconnect thin-walled elements. <b>Blind</b> <b>rivets</b> and nuts as connectors are considered in the frames of this paper. Rivets have some benefits over self-drilling screws. They are: we can obtain more dense connection when using rivets. So we can increase bearing capacity of connection; a lower cost of riveted connection; a large variety of installation tools for riveted connection: manual, pneumatic, battery; side; an easy installation: access to the connected element is required only from one. These benefits provide increasingly growling popularity to rivets. In the paper 4 types of rivets are considered: combined (aluminum/steel) <b>blind</b> <b>rivets,</b> zinc-coated steel <b>blind</b> <b>rivets,</b> stainless steel <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> and <b>blind</b> nuts. The features of each type of rivets are described in the paper. The influence on the behaviour of connections is revealed. The results of experimental research performed by the authors are presented in the paper. A bearing capacity shear of riveted connections is studied in the experiment. There are 3 types of riveted connections subjected to experiment: connection made by blind combined rivets; connection made by zinc-coated steel blind rivets; connection made by blind nuts. A connection between elements with significantly different thicknesses is modeled in the experiment. In reality this situation takes place, for example, in the roofing of buildings, where trapezoidal sheet can be fastened to purlin by rivets. As {{a result of the}} experiment the authors found out that the local deformations occuring under rivet head in the thick element significantly affect the behaviour and bearing capacity of the connection. That’s why the results of connection's bearing capacity obtained in tests were lower than the bearing capacity of rivet declared by manufacturers...|$|R
40|$|The {{yield load}} {{equivalent}} for mechanical joints is a characteristic joint value, which appraises the joint specific deformation behavior. The value considers the maximum load {{of a joint}} {{as well as the}} ductility of the joint. Therefore the value is a combined strength / deformation value with high information content. The value guaranties an adequate joint deformation reserve. The shown examples and the application variety prove the adaptability of the yield load equivalent. Those examples as been verified for different fastener types and joint geometries. Based on the appraisal of shear loaded lock bolt and <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> joints the yield load equivalent has been used and proven for the appraisal of: 1. punch rivets / self piercing riveting 2. clinching 3. spot welding 4. tension loaded joints 5. peel loaded joints The appraisal of multiple joint specimens was difficult and is now possible with the yield load equivalent. For this kind of joints the yield load equivalent de liver the possibility to describe the complex joint characteristic with one comparable value. The easy appraisal of the transition area between force and form closure is an additional and important issue for the characterization of load bearing characteristic of mechanical joints. Due to this value a comparability of test result is possible without knowledge of the exact test assembly. Current research projects at the Fraunhofer AGP - Rostock have the goal of implementing the yield load equivalent in national guidelines and standards for dimensioning of <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> and lock bolt joints...|$|E

40|$|For the {{dismantling}} of austenitic components of nuclear facilities fastening techniques, usable remote controlled under water, are investigated. The components are only one-sided accessable. The fastening techniques are based on Drawn Arc Stud Welding, Mechanical Drilling followed by mechanical clamping of the fastening elements and thermal drilling with Contact Arc Metal Cutting (CAMC) followed by mechanical clamping of the fastening elements. In thermal drilling process with CAMC hollow electrodes of different materials with internal water scavenging are investigated with regard to wear behaviour and removal rate. The graphite type EG 88 shows the longest electrode life, tested in plates of thickness from 20 mm up to 65 mm and using dielectric fluid both drinking water and deionized water. 14 holes were drilled in a plate of a thickness of 30 mm (adequate to 420 mm) without electrode-changing, in this time the wear on the length 16, 9 mm. Minor tapered holes and rough interior surfaces of the pearcing holes are the results. Fastening elements plug and <b>blind</b> <b>rivet,</b> which are customary in trade, have been investigated. The latter guarantees the necessary mould clamp. The selected <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> is usable for plate-thicknesses from 6 mm up to 42 mm. In tensile test the rivet pin breaks from 78 kN upwards.
