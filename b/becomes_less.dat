5|$|For most bikes, {{depending}} on geometry and mass distribution, capsize is stable at low speeds, and <b>becomes</b> <b>less</b> stable as speed increases {{until it is}} no longer stable. However, on many bikes, tire interaction with the pavement is sufficient to prevent capsize from becoming unstable at high speeds.|$|E
5|$|From {{this point}} on, the term 'dreadnought' <b>became</b> <b>less</b> widely used. Most pre-dreadnought battleships were {{scrapped}} or hulked after World War I, so the term 'dreadnought' <b>became</b> <b>less</b> necessary.|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} stair <b>became</b> <b>less</b> {{common in}} the 20th century. As houses <b>became</b> <b>less</b> formal and household staff <b>became</b> <b>less</b> common, the need for both front and back stairs declined. Many houses were designed with a single stair for common use. However, since the 1980s, house sizes have increased significantly and designs have become more elaborate and more complex. Multiple stairs are becoming more common once again. Combination stairs are occasionally seen in new house designs.|$|R

5|$|The American robin's {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} woodland and more open farmland and urban areas. It <b>becomes</b> <b>less</b> common as a breeder in the southernmost {{part of the}} Deep South of the United States, and there prefers large shade trees on lawns.

25|$|In general, dogs age in {{a manner}} similar to humans. Their bodies begin to develop {{problems}} that are less common at younger ages, they are more prone to serious or fatal conditions such as cancer, stroke, etc., they <b>become</b> <b>less</b> mobile and may develop joint problems such as arthritis, and in old age often <b>become</b> <b>less</b> physically active. Additionally, they <b>become</b> <b>less</b> able to handle change, including wide climatic or temperature variation, and may develop dietary or skin problems or go deaf. In some cases incontinence may develop and breathing difficulties may appear.|$|R
5|$|Also, whilst {{productivity}} {{figures have}} improved, median incomes and stock market prices, {{and thus the}} returns to capital and labor, have not improved. Furthermore, government consumption (government activity excluding transfer payments) represents between 15–20% of GDP, but since the sector is measured at cost it <b>becomes</b> <b>less</b> and less productive as it grows larger. Thus, the more government consumption there is, the more published GDP figures tend to overestimate growth in living standards.|$|E
5|$|In nuclear reactors, 10B is {{used for}} {{reactivity}} control and in emergency shutdown systems. It can serve either function {{in the form of}} borosilicate control rods or as boric acid. In pressurized water reactors, boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel <b>becomes</b> <b>less</b> reactive.|$|E
5|$|With {{regard to}} the show's notorious habit of killing off major characters, Armitage {{said he had no}} {{preference}} as to Lucas' possible exit. He has performed his own stunts on the series, which have included a waterboarding scene, although the character <b>becomes</b> <b>less</b> physical in the ninth series. The Lucas North character and his portrayal by Armitage met with unanimous praise from cast, crew, and reviewers.|$|E

5|$|As time passes, Woodroof shows {{compassion}} towards gay, lesbian, and transgender {{members of}} the club and making money <b>becomes</b> <b>less</b> of a concern; his priority is provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in 1987 he files {{a lawsuit against the}} FDA. He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{in large}} {{bodies of water}} differs {{markedly}} from camouflage on land. The environment {{is essentially the same}} on all sides. Light always falls from above, and there is generally no variable background to compare with trees and bushes. Three main camouflage methods predominate in water: transparency, reflection, and counter-illumination. Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counter-illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage <b>becomes</b> <b>less</b> important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, acne was {{estimated}} to affect 633 million people globally, making it the 8th most common disease worldwide. Acne commonly occurs in adolescence and affects an estimated 80–90% of teenagers in the Western world. Lower rates are reported in some rural societies. Children and adults may also be affected before and after puberty. Although acne <b>becomes</b> <b>less</b> common in adulthood, it persists in nearly half of affected people into their twenties and thirties and a smaller group continue to have difficulties into their forties.|$|E

5|$|It is conjectured that a {{progressive}} decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals. Conversely, some hormones are {{regulated by the}} immune system, notably thyroid hormone activity. The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly. As people age, two things happen that negatively affect their vitamin D levels. First, they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels. This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation. Second, as a person ages the skin <b>becomes</b> <b>less</b> adept at producing vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|Past Phoenicia, the {{surrounding}} slopes become steeper {{as the road}} and creek curve around Panther Mountain, one of the Catskill High Peaks, to the south. At Allaben, the Shandaken Tunnel crosses under the road, bringing water from Schoharie Reservoir into the creek. The road and creek start bending to the south to the hamlet of Shandaken, where the town hall {{on the south side}} of the road is followed by the southern terminus of NY42's northern segment. As NY28 continues trending southwest, the valley <b>becomes</b> <b>less</b> developed. Balsam Mountain, another High Peak, looms ahead.|$|E
5|$|Prevention mostly {{involves}} eliminating kissing {{bugs and}} avoiding their bites. Other preventative efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine {{has not been}} developed as of 2017. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox. Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but <b>becomes</b> <b>less</b> effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of end–stage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox cause temporary side effects in up to 40% of people including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation.|$|E

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} form {{complete}} series of compounds with all usually encountered anions, which well illustrate group trends. These compounds {{can be described}} as involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions. This description is most accurate for alkali halides and <b>becomes</b> <b>less</b> and less accurate as cationic and anionic charge increase, and as the anion becomes larger and more polarisable. For instance, ionic bonding gives way to metallic bonding along the series NaCl, Na2O, Na2S, Na3P, Na3As, Na3Sb, Na3Bi, Na.|$|E
5|$|The {{pulsations}} {{result from}} a process called the κ-mechanism. A part of the star's outer atmosphere becomes optically thick due to partial ionization of certain elements. When these atoms lose an electron, the likelihood that they will absorb energy increases. This results {{in an increase in}} temperature that causes the atmosphere to expand. The inflated atmosphere <b>becomes</b> <b>less</b> ionized and loses energy, causing it to cool and shrink back down again. The result of this cycle is a periodic pulsation of the atmosphere and a matching variation of the luminosity.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} Parkinson's disease, with {{treatment}} directed at improving symptoms. Initial treatment is typically with the antiparkinson medication levodopa (L-DOPA), with dopamine agonists being used once levodopa <b>becomes</b> <b>less</b> effective. As the disease progresses and neurons continue to be lost, these medications become less effective {{while at the same}} time they produce a complication marked by involuntary writhing movements. Diet and some forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving symptoms. Surgery to place microelectrodes for deep brain stimulation has been used to reduce motor symptoms in severe cases where drugs are ineffective. Evidence for treatments for the non-movement-related symptoms of PD, such as sleep disturbances and emotional problems, is less strong.|$|E
