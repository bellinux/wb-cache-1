40|$|There was {{an average}} annual {{increase}} in employment of 1. 7 p. c. in 2008, according to the statistics gleaned from a reduced population of enterprises that filed their social balance sheet by 16 September 2009 at the latest. End-of-year results (+ 0. 8 p. c.) point to a significant slowdown in growth {{during the course of}} the year, reflecting the economic downturn which began at the end of 2007. Full-time staff numbers stabilised, but the number of part-time workers continued to grow. The expansion of this part-time working arrangement is not only attributable to the recruitment of workers on shorter hours; shifts between full-time and part-time working arrangements have also been observed, especially in large firms that have restructured. As a result of the economic downturn, the share of temporary work has fallen. In firms filing a full-format social balance sheet, a reduction in the use of temporary agency workers has also been noted. The overall wage bill in the firms included in the reduced population grew by 5. 3 p. c. in 2008. At the same time, the volume of labour expanded by 1. 6 p. c., so that costs per hour worked increased by 3. 7 p. c. on average. This article includes an assessment, by <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> of how closely the indicative wage norm set for the period 2006 - 2008 has been followed. This survey was carried out on the basis of a population of firms that had filed a social balance sheet for the three consecutive years. For the first time ever, thanks to the introduction of a new version of the social balance sheet, it has been possible to have a breakdown of staff numbers by educational level. On average, women tend to have a more intensive level of training than men. Workers’ educational requirements vary considerably according to the <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> Since the year 2008, training activities have been broken down between formal and informal vocational training and initial training, whereas before only formal training and a very small proportion of informal training had been taken into account. Participation rates for these three types of training come to respectively 37, 21 and 1 p. c. of the workforce. Budgets for training accounted for a total of 1. 7 p. c. of staff expenses, including 1. 2 p. c. for formal training alone, which is still well below the target for the private sector that had been set at 1. 9 p. c. for 2006. Major differences in training policy can be observed in firms classified by size and <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> whether it is a question of ranging from the volume of training activities, the size of budget, or type of training selected. An analysis of individual data shows that the probability for an enterprise to provide formal or informal training depends above all on its size, with the <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> ranking second. Whether it is linked to a non-resident firm and the composition of the workforce (notably the relative share of staff with higher education qualifications) also play a significant role. Within firms that do offer training, the dispersion of training costs depends very much on firm-specific factors, which cannot be taken into consideration by a general model. employment, staff costs, training, working hours, employment contract, full-time, part-time, skills, temporary worker...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{applies the}} theory of finite Markov chains to analyse the {{demographic}} evolution of Belgian enterprises. While other methodologies concentrate on the entry and exit of firms, the Markov approach also analyses migrations between economic sectors. Besides helping to provide a fuller picture {{of the evolution of}} the population, Markov chains also enable forecasts of its future composition to be made, as well as the computation of average lifetimes of companies by <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> The method is applied to Belgian data from the Crossroads Bank for Enterprises (CBE). To ensure compliance with Eurostat-OECD definitions, only 'active' enterprises, i. e. enterprises with a positive turnover and/or at least one employee, are considered. The forecasting method is applied to simulate the demographic evolution of the CBE population between 2000 and 2006. This simulation seems to match well the observed changes. Taking migrations into account yields better forecasts than if they are not considered. Moreover, several off-diagonal percentages in the transition matrix are sigificantly different from zero. A case study shows that these migrations are changes in main activity and not the consequence of corrections of wrongly classified firms. Next, the average remaining lifetime and the average age of enterprises in a particular <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> is computed and analysed. These lifetimes and ages differ considerably across branches. As expected the life-times of public services are longer than average. Shorter lifetimes combined with an increasing number of enterprises is an indication of renewal inside the branch. A low average age is a sign of relatively new branches. Comparing age to total expected lifetime yields an indicator of closeness to extinction. This might be an indicator of the maturity of the branch. The method is more generally applicable {{in the sense that it}} can be used to analyse other populations than those from the CBE and other partitions of the populatio...|$|E

40|$|According to {{the results}} of the social balance sheets {{available}} in September 2008, employment rose by 2. 3 p. c. in 2007. The increase concerned both full-time as well as part-time workers. The rise in part-time working is only partially explained by the hiring of part-time workers : this year again, medium-sized and large enterprises also saw numerous changes in working arrangements. Although women still account for the bulk of part-time workers, the increase in the part-time rate was greater for men than for women. The analysis shows that part-time working is spread unevenly in the various branches of activity. As in previous years, the article studies staff movements and the characteristics of workers joining and leaving companies filing full-format accounts. It also examines reasons for leaving and the external turnover of workers by comparing the results from the various groups of enterprises categorised according to their size or their <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> The analysis also highlights the further advance in 2007 of temporary employment contracts – whose proportion is tending to become more uniform in the various categories of company size – and the increased use of agency work in companies filing full-format accounts. Recourse to these contracts as instruments for workforce adjustments varies considerably from one <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> to the other. The total wage bill rose by 5. 1 p. c. between 2006 and 2007 in the reduced population of companies. Over the same period there was a 2. 3 p. c. {{growth in the number of}} hours worked, so that hourly labour costs grew by 2. 8 p. c. on average. The rise was more pronounced for full-time than for part-time workers. Major differences in levels are still discernible in terms of hourly costs, depending on the size and <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> of the companies. In terms of training, the results for 2006 still fall well short of the set targets : training costs accounted for 1. 17 p. c. of the total wage bill whereas the target specified in the Generation Pact for this same year was 1. 9 p. c. At the same time, the participation rate in training was only 35. 2 p. c. whereas a target has been set of 50 p. c. by 2010. Growth was nevertheless recorded between 2006 and 2007 within a favourable economic context : the cost indicator for training grew by 4 p. c. and the participation rate by 0. 2 p. c. If these increases were applied to the level observed in 2006, these same indicators should amount to 1. 22 and 35. 3 p. c. respectively for 2007. employment, staff costs, training, working hours, employment contract, full-time, part-time, skills, temporary worker...|$|E
