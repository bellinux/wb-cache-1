5|$|Momohime's {{story begins}} after {{she wakes up}} Kyo with {{memories}} of being killed by the dying Jinkuro when he was aiming for her betrothed, the samurai lord Yukinojo. Upon encountering the spirit of Jinkuro, he forcefully possesses her, but before the process of soul transference is finished, they are attacked. In the confusion, Momohime's soul is kidnapped by the vengeful monk Rankai and Jinkuro is forced to follow Kongiku as Momohime's body will die if her soul is harmed. With her soul safe, Jinkuro sets out to regain the Dark Resurrection Demon <b>Blade</b> <b>so</b> he can properly utilize his Soul Transference Technique and gain influence through a new host. Encountering Yukinojo, who is searching for Momohime, the two battle. Momohime forces Jinkuro to spare Yukinojo, even when she learns that Yukinojo's intentions in marrying her {{were part of a}} scheme to ruin her family as punishment for defying the shogun. Jinkuro goes to Yukinojo's compound to retrieve the Dark Resurrection, but the storehouse where it is said to be is absorbed into Yomi by demons. Descending into Yomi, Jinkuro's soul is briefly captured by a demon, and it is only with Momohime's help that he escapes and learns that the Dark Resurrection was never in the storehouse. With Momohime's body beginning to fail due to the strain Soul Transference put on it, Jinkuro attempts to ascent to Heaven so he can become an immortal demon, but is stopped by Raijin and Fujin.|$|E

Link then has to defeat the Imprisoned, a monstrous form of Demise attempting to reach the Sealed Temple, after the old woman shows him a second dormant Time Gate. With the Imprisoned defeated, Link sets out to strengthen the Goddess Sword by passing trials set by the ancient Goddesses and using their gifts to find Sacred Flames to purify and strengthen the <b>blade</b> <b>so</b> the Time Gate can be awakened. Returning to find the Imprisoned attempting to break free, Link reseals it with help from Groose. Activating the Time Gate and traveling to the past, he finds Zelda and learns that she is the mortal reincarnation of Hylia: Hylia could not kill Demise and was too weakened from their battle to fend him off again, so she created the Goddess Sword and reincarnated as a mortal to find someone who would fulfill her duty by using the Triforce to wish Demise's destruction, as only mortals can use the artifact. Zelda then seals herself inside a crystal to strengthen the seal on Demise, after granting her power to the Goddess Sword, evolving it into the true Master Sword.|$|E

Kumbudren Samy tries to bribe the doctor to lie but she tells the police constable who only pleads with the him but later gives up and releases him. Actor Suriya attends a school function in the town to promote educational awareness through his Agaram Foundation. Just as he is about to leave the Zamindar requests him to stay and witness Walter's acting skills, who shows off his depictions of the nine emotions (Navarasas) and impresses everyone, including Kumbedren Samy. The drunk Kumbredren Samy then reveals to the drunk Zamindar that he actually does love his brother and that all the anger and hate it is just an act.|$|E
500|$|During the 16th century {{members of}} Clan MacAulay were in {{conflict}} with members of clans Buchanan and Galbraith. On 1 August 1590, Walter MacAulay, son of Allan MacAulay of Durling, was killed on the [...] "Highway and street of Dunbarton" [...] in a clash against a contingent of Buchanans, who were led by Thomas Buchanan, Sheriff Depute of Dunbarton. Also wounded in the encounter was Walter's brother, Duncan MacAulay, who was wounded through the [...] "harn pan" [...] (brain); John dhu MacGregor, who was wounded behind his shoulder <b>blade</b> <b>so</b> that [...] "his lights and entrails might be seen" [...] (lungs); James Colquhoun, who {{was wounded in the}} [...] "wamb" [...] (stomach); and others including a MacAulay, Miller, and MacGibbon.

On 6 October 1590, Thomas Buchanan of Blairlusk, John Buchanan, his son John Buchanan Burgess of Dunbarton, and others were formally charged in Edinburgh with the murder of Walter MacAulay. The accused were ordered to appear before the Justice at Edinburgh on 21 December 1590. The case was then deferred to March and again the accused failed to appear. The following May saw the Bond of Manrent between MacAulay of Ardincaple and MacGregor of Glenstrae, in which both chiefs swore to assist each other, their [...] "kin and friends in all their honest actions against whatsoever person or persons the Kings Majesty being only excepted".|$|E
2500|$|In older plug designs both blades {{were the}} same width, so the plug could be {{inserted}} into the receptacle either way around. Many plugs manufactured since 1948 are polarized; the neutral blade is [...] wide, [...] wider than the line <b>blade,</b> <b>so</b> the plug can be inserted only one way. Polarized 1-15P plugs will not fit into unpolarized receptacles, which possess only narrow slots. Polarized 1-15P plugs will fit 5-15R grounded receptacles, which have the same wider slot for the neutral blade. Some devices that do not distinguish between neutral and line, such as internally isolated AC adapters, are still produced with unpolarized narrow blades. Cheater plug adapters allow a [...] "3-prong" [...] grounded 5-15P plug to be mated to a non-grounded 1-15R receptacle. The adapters include a spade lug to allow connecting to ground, often via the cover screw used to attach the outlet faceplate. These adapters are illegal in some jurisdictions, in particular throughout Canada.|$|E

25|$|The NEMA 5-15 plug has two flat {{parallel}} blades like NEMA 1-15, {{but also}} adds a ground (earth) pin. It is rated 15A at 125 volts. The ground (earth) pin {{is longer than}} the line and neutral <b>blades,</b> <b>so</b> the device is grounded before the power is connected. Both current-carrying blades on grounding plugs are normally narrow, since the ground (earth) pin enforces polarity. NEMA 1-15 plugs are also compatible with NEMA 5-15 sockets.|$|R

While the propellers of the aircraft were found fully feathered after the crash, the crew did not feather them, because they were attempting to restart the engines.

50|$|Armament {{was similar}} to the Cant Z.1007, rather than the SM.79. There was a dorsal Caproni-Lanciani Delta turret, with a 12.7 mm (.50 in) Scotti machine gun, and 350 rounds. Another Scotti was in the ventral gondola. Other two Scotti were in the flanks with six 120-round belts. It was a {{theoretical}} improvement, though Scotti machine guns, even with a slightly higher rate of fire, were much less reliable than the Breda. Another disadvantage was the inability of the turret to fire directly forward, through the propeller's <b>blades,</b> <b>so</b> the aircraft had no defence from frontal attacks.|$|R

Like most women of her class she was armed only with a single slender <b>blade,</b> <b>so</b> that in such an emergency as now confronted her she must depend almost solely upon her cleverness in remaining undiscovered by enemies. With utmost caution she crept warily toward the crest of the hill, taking advantage of every natural screen that the landscape afforded to conceal her approach from possible observers ahead, while momentarily she cast quick glances rearward lest she be taken by surprise from that quarter.|$|E
50|$|The multi-bladed {{wind pump}} or wind turbine atop a lattice tower {{made of wood}} or steel hence became, for many years, a fixture of the {{landscape}} throughout rural America. These mills, made {{by a variety of}} manufacturers, featured a large number of <b>blades</b> <b>so</b> that they would turn slowly with considerable torque in moderate winds and be self-regulating in high winds. A tower-top gearbox and crankshaft converted the rotary motion into reciprocating strokes carried downward through a rod to the pump cylinder below. Today, rising energy costs and improved pumping technology are increasing interest in the use of this once declining technology.|$|R
5000|$|The {{use of a}} rotor for {{vertical}} flight {{has existed}} since 400 BC {{in the form of}} the bamboo-copter, an ancient Chinese toy. The bamboo-copter is spun by rolling a stick attached to a rotor. The spinning creates lift, and the toy flies when released. The philosopher Ge Hong's book the Baopuzi (Master Who Embraces Simplicity), written around 317, describes the apocryphal use of a possible rotor in aircraft: [...] "Some have made flying cars 飛車 with wood from the inner part of the jujube tree, using ox-leather (straps) fastened to returning <b>blades</b> <b>so</b> as to set the machine in motion".|$|R
50|$|Because of his {{technical}} background Fred {{was invited}} to join the newly created group around Ludwig Bölkow.

Boelkow was in need for a test pilot for his Bo 46 project (the Bo 46 employed a novice rotor concept with variable sweep main rotor <b>blades</b> <b>so</b> to achieve higher speeds in forward flight.
