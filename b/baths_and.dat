5|$|Pensford Colliery, {{which opened}} in 1909, had the latest {{equipment}} at the time including coal cutters. It had a red brick winding house, pithead <b>baths</b> <b>and</b> a coal washery. Faulting made coal production expensive and it closed in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Little factual {{information}} survives about Vespasian's government during {{the ten years}} he was emperor, his reign {{is best known for}} financial reforms following the demise of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Vespasian was noted for his mildness and for loyalty to the people. For example, much money was spent on public works and the restoration and beautification of Rome: a new forum, the Temple of Peace, the public <b>baths</b> <b>and</b> the Colosseum.|$|E
5|$|Much {{like many}} architects of his generation, {{following}} the British victory Hollamby pursued {{a career in}} local authority offices. He first worked as an architect for the Miners' Welfare Commission from 1947 to 1949, in this position designing pithead <b>baths</b> <b>and</b> a colliery extension at Lofthouse, Yorkshire. After gaining further qualifications from the Royal Institute of British Architects, he proceeded with a three-year evening course in town planning, run by William Holford and Arthur Ling at the Bartlett School of Architecture, London.|$|E

5|$|Being well-educated themselves, the Ayyubid rulers became munificent {{patrons of}} {{learning}} and educational activity. Different madrasa-type schools were built by them throughout the empire, not only for education, but also to popularize knowledge of Sunni Islam. According to Ibn Jubayr, under Saladin, Damascus had 20 schools, 100 <b>baths,</b> <b>and</b> {{a large number of}} Sufi dervish monasteries. He also built several schools in Aleppo, Jerusalem, Cairo, Alexandria, and in various cities in the Hejaz. Similarly, many schools were built by his successors also. Their wives and daughters, commanders, and nobles established and financed numerous educational institutions as well.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the amphitheatre was completed, Titus's short reign had already endured a series of disasters: two months after he had succeeded Vespasian, Mount Vesuvius had erupted, {{destroying}} Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae, and Oplontis; a fire had burned {{in the city of}} Rome for three days and three nights causing substantial damage and destroying the Temple of Jupiter that had recently been restored by Vespasian; and there had been an outbreak of plague which was said to be the worst the city had ever endured. To dedicate the amphitheatre and the <b>baths,</b> <b>and</b> probably in an attempt to mollify both the Roman public and the gods, Titus inaugurated the opening of the Colosseum with lavish games which lasted for more than a hundred days.|$|E
5|$|Hot springs {{have been}} used for bathing at least since Paleolithic times. The oldest known spa is a stone pool on China's Lisan {{mountain}} built in the Qin Dynasty in the 3rd century BC, at the same site where the Huaqing Chi palace was later built. In the first century AD, Romans conquered Aquae Sulis, now Bath, Somerset, England, and used the hot springs there to feed public <b>baths</b> <b>and</b> underfloor heating. The admission fees for these baths probably represent the first commercial use of geothermal power. The world's oldest geothermal district heating system in Chaudes-Aigues, France, has been operating since the 14th century. The earliest industrial exploitation began in 1827 with the use of geyser steam to extract boric acid from volcanic mud in Larderello, Italy.|$|E

5|$|The {{fortress}} contained barracks, granaries, headquarters, military <b>baths,</b> <b>and</b> {{an unusual}} elliptical building which {{had it been}} finished may have been intended to act as the governor of Britain's headquarters. Several factors including {{the uniqueness of the}} elliptical building, the method of construction, and the unusual size of the fortress– 20% larger than other Roman fortresses in Britain– suggest that it may have been intended as the base for a potential invasion of Ireland, and perhaps eventually to become the capital of the unified British Isles under Rome.|$|E

5|$|Examples of Ottoman Turkish {{architecture}} {{are located}} in the Old Bazaar. Mosques in Skopje are usually simple in design, with a square base and a single dome and minaret. There entrance is usually emphasised by a portico, as on Mustafa Pasha Mosque, dating from the 15th century. Some mosques show some originality in their appearance: Sultan Murad and Yahya Pasha mosques have lost their dome and have a pyramidal roof, while Isa Bey mosque has a rectangular base, two domes and two side wings. The Aladža Mosque was originally covered with blue faience, but it disappeared in the 1689 Great Fire. However, some tiles are still visible on the adjoining türbe. Other Turkish public monuments include the 16th-century clock tower, a bedesten, three caravanserais, two Turkish <b>baths</b> <b>and</b> the Stone Bridge, first mentioned in 1469.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the First World War, {{sales of}} peat began to decline, as working horses were {{replaced}} by motor lorries and tractors. The British Moss Litter Company bought up two other companies who were extracting peat in Crowle Moor in 1935. Most peat was sold as bales, with 'fine' peat being used by gardeners and the growing of mushrooms and 'litter' being used for animal bedding, while 'tailings' were used for floor covering at show-jumping events and for bulking up feed for cows. Around one-fifth was not baled, and was used for various purposes, including the production of firelighters, for health cures at Harrogate <b>baths,</b> <b>and</b> the purifying of gas by gas companies, for which it was mixed with iron ore at Creyke's Siding. By the late 1940s, it was finding a new market as litter for battery hen houses, and by then around 90 per cent was baled.|$|E
5|$|John Thomas Perceval, {{the son of}} Spencer Perceval, {{spent about}} a year at Brislington House, from 1831 until February 1832, {{followed}} by two years at Ticehurst House, Ticehurst in Sussex. In Brislington House Perceval experienced, {{in spite of the}} expense, a regime of deprivation, brutality and degradation. For eight months, during which time he was completely under the control of his voices, spirits and presences, he was kept under restraint, either in a straitjacket or tied down in bed. Treatment consisted of cold <b>baths</b> <b>and</b> an operation to sever his temporal artery. He was later {{one of the founders of}} the Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society and acted as their honorary secretary for about twenty years. Perceval's two books about his experience in asylums were republished by the anthropologist Gregory Bateson in 1962, and in recent years he has been hailed as a pioneer of the mental-health advocacy movement.|$|E

5|$|The baths were {{originally}} built in approximately 1815, {{by a local}} builder called Newton, from John Pinch the elder's design, on the Duke of Cleveland's land, giving the site its name. They were intended as public pleasure <b>baths,</b> <b>and</b> {{are believed to be}} the oldest surviving outdoor swimming baths in England. The area of Bath to the north and east of the River Avon was undergoing development {{at the end of the}} 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, after the opening of Pulteney Bridge on land around Bathwick which had been owned by William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath. William Johnstone had inherited the land and planned to create a new town. It was foreseen that, along with the access provided by Pulteney Bridge and Great Pulteney Street, the eastern side of the Avon would become popular with speculators and developers, as Bath had become perhaps the most fashionable of the rapidly developing British spa towns, attracting many notable visitors. In the 18th century, Bath acquired its first purpose-built theatre, the Old Orchard Street Theatre. It was rebuilt as the Theatre Royal, along with the Grand Pump Room attached to the Roman <b>Baths</b> <b>and</b> assembly rooms. Master of ceremonies Beau Nash, who presided over the city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761, drew up a code of behaviour for public entertainments. After 1789, the financial climate did not encourage further building, as the Panic of 1797, related to a period of deflation between 1793 and 1800, was followed by the Napoleonic Wars, which saw the Depression of 1807. These limited the proposed development of new housing in the area for some years. The Bathwick Water Act of 1801 had prohibited nude bathing in the river and meant that many local subscribers were willing to put money into the construction of the baths.|$|E

The garden is laid out with octagonal flower beds and has good network of water supply. There are niches in the Mahal which permit natural light to the main hall and smaller rooms.|$|E
5|$|There are 58 {{scheduled}} monuments in Bath and North East Somerset. Some of {{the oldest}} are Neolithic including the Stanton Drew stone circles and several tumuli. The Great Circle at Stanton Drew {{is one of the}} largest Neolithic monuments ever built, and the second largest stone circle in Britain (after Avebury). The date of construction is not known but is thought to be between 3000 and 2000 BCE which places it in the Late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age. There are also several Iron Age hillforts such as Maes Knoll, which was later incorporated into the medieval Wansdyke, a defensive earthwork, several sections of which are included in this list. The Romano-British period is represented with several sites, most notably the Roman <b>Baths</b> <b>and</b> city walls in Bath. More recent sites include several bridges which date from the Middle Ages to the Palladian bridge in Prior Park Landscape Garden and Dundas Aqueduct which was built in 1805 which is the most recent site included in the list.
