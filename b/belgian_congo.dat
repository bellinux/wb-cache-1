5|$|Despite Belgium's occupation, the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo</b> {{remained}} {{loyal to}} the government in exile and was put {{at the disposal of}} the Allies, making a significant contribution to the Allied war effort.|$|E
5|$|A medical unit {{from the}} Congo, the 10th (<b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo)</b> Casualty Clearing Station, {{was created in}} 1943 and served {{alongside}} British forces in the Far East during the Burma Campaign. The unit included 350 African and 20 European personnel and continued to serve with the British until 1945.|$|E

50|$|Following <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo's</b> {{independence}} as the Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville) in 1960, Belgian interests {{supported the}} short-lived breakaway state of Katanga (1960-1963).|$|R
50|$|The area {{included}} all pre-1914 German colonial territories in Africa, {{as well as}} additional parts of the French, Belgian and British colonial holdings in Africa. These included the French and <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congos,</b> Northern and Southern Rhodesia (the latter going perhaps to South Africa), Nyasaland, southern Kenya with Nairobi (northern Kenya was {{to be given to}} Italy), Uganda, Gabon, Ubangui-Chari, Nigeria, Dahomey, the Gold Coast, Zanzibar, nearly all of Niger and Chad, as well as the naval bases of Dakar and Bathurst.|$|R
5|$|The {{participation}} of {{soldiers from the}} <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo</b> was, however, largely forgotten following Congolese independence in 1960 and decades of subsequent war. In recent years {{the profile of the}} veterans has been raised by exhibitions creating greater public awareness.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of working elephants {{has also been}} attempted in Africa. The taming of African elephants in the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo</b> began by decree of Leopold II of Belgium during the 19th century and continues to the present with the Api Elephant Domestication Centre.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, as {{a direct}} result of this campaign, Belgium {{formally}} annexed the territory, creating the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo.</b> Conditions for the indigenous population improved dramatically with the suppression of forced labour, although many officials who had formerly worked for the Free State were retained in their posts long after annexation.|$|E
50|$|Ferdinand Essandja (sometimes Fernand Essendja or Ferdinand Esandja) was a Congolese {{politician}} and businessman. He {{was the chairman}} of the Parti de l’Unité Congolaise in 1959. He attended the Belgo-Congolese Round Table Conference in early 1960 as a delegate of the Parti National du Progrès (PNP) to participate in negotiations for the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo's</b> independence. At one point he served as the mayor of the Barumbu commune of Léopoldville. In June 1961 Essendja became the managing director of Air Congo, the flag carrier of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. By 1967 he was the vice president of company.|$|R
50|$|The Assistant Secretary {{felt that}} Northern Rhodesia had {{bargaining}} {{power with the}} northern frontier (the Mpweto line), which the Belgians were keen on. He proposed that the Anglo-Belgian Fisheries Advisory Board meet regularly to resolve each territory's fishing rights, to agree on African fishing methods, {{to agree that the}} Europeans buy the fish caught by the Africans (Greeks at Mpweto had in the past been doing large scale fishing and refused to buy excess fish from the Africans), to check legislation, and to look into the issue of <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo's</b> desire to hunt crocodiles. The Assistant Secretary noted that the Belgians were uncooperative.|$|R
25|$|Partially {{motivated}} by Rhodes's {{dream of a}} Cape to Cairo Railway, railway and telegraph lines were laid across previously barren Rhodesia with great speed, linking South Africa to the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo's</b> southern Katanga province by 1910. The British South Africa Police, responsible for law enforcement in Southern Rhodesia, was established in 1896. A number of police forces north of the river amalgamated to form the Northern Rhodesia Police in 1911. Northern and Southern Rhodesians fought alongside the British in the Second Boer War and the First World War; about 40% of Southern Rhodesian white men fought in the latter, mostly on the Western Front in Europe. Black soldiers served in East Africa with the Rhodesia Native Regiment.|$|R
5|$|In 1913, the {{government}} increased restrictions on private travel and immigrants, which meant anybody arriving in Mongalla and wishing to go north from the Uganda or the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo</b> could be examined for sleeping sickness by a medical officer. The maximum punishment for any {{breach of the}} new regulations was a £10 fine or a 6-month prison sentence.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, a three sided pyramid {{was erected}} in Faradje, <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo</b> {{to commemorate the}} actions of the Congolese in Ethiopia. Each face of the pyramid was inscribed with the name of each major {{location}} of fighting, including Saïo. Many locations throughout the country (presently the Democratic Republic of the Congo) are named for the battle.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt's {{expedition}} reached Mongalla {{at the end}} of February, {{coming from}} the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo</b> via the Lado Enclave. He was impressed by the Egyptian and Sudanese troops, but when visiting a native dance he commented on the lack of middle-aged men, a result of the Mahdist wars that had ended over ten years ago.|$|E

5|$|Since that discovery, {{there have}} been many {{searches}} in terrestrial materials for natural sources of technetium. In 1962, technetium-99 was isolated and identified in pitchblende from the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo</b> in extremely small quantities (about 0.2ng/kg); there it originates as a spontaneous fission product of uranium-238. The Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor contains evidence that significant amounts of technetium-99 were produced and have since decayed into ruthenium-99.|$|E
5|$|The {{involvement}} of the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo</b> (the modern-day Democratic Republic of Congo) in World War II began with the German invasion of Belgium in May 1940. Despite Belgium's surrender, the Congo remained in the conflict on the Allied side, administered by the Belgian government in exile, and provided much-needed raw materials, most notably gold and uranium, to Britain and the United States.|$|E
5|$|A medical unit {{from the}} Congo, the 10th (<b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo)</b> Casualty Clearing Station, {{was formed in}} 1943, and served {{alongside}} British forces during the invasion of Madagascar and in the Far East during the Burma Campaign. The unit (which had a small body of Force Publique troops for local defense of the station) included 350 black and 20 white personnel, and continued to serve with the British until 1945.|$|E
50|$|When the <b>Belgians</b> granted <b>Congo</b> {{independence}} in 1960 {{the new state}} deteriorated rapidly, {{and so did the}} park. It was only in 1969 when President Mobutu began to take a personal interest in conservation, that the park was revived. In the process of Mobutu's Africanization campaign, it was renamed Virunga National Park, and the first Congolese Wildlife Authority was established.|$|R

25|$|A former <b>Belgian</b> colony, the <b>Congo</b> gained {{independence}} {{during the}} Year of Africa. The State of Katanga, led by Moise Tshombe soon announced secession, supported by Belgian business interests, the Belgian military, and indirectly by France.|$|R
5|$|After the Allied {{victory in}} Abyssinia the Force Publique {{moved to the}} British colony of Nigeria, which was {{being used as a}} staging ground for a planned {{invasion}} of Vichy-controlled Dahomey which did not occur, was also garrisoned by 13,000 Congolese troops. Then a part of the Force Publique went to Egypt and British Mandatory Palestine and was redesignated the 1st <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo</b> Brigade Group during 1943 and 1944.|$|E
5|$|Belgian {{reporter}} Tintin {{and his dog}} Snowy {{travel to}} the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo,</b> where a cheering crowd of native Congolese greet them. Tintin hires a native boy, Coco, to assist him in his travels, and shortly after, Tintin rescues Snowy from a crocodile. A criminal stowaway attempts to kill Tintin, but monkeys throw coconuts at the stowaway that knock him unconscious. A monkey kidnaps Snowy, but Tintin saves him by disguising himself as another monkey.|$|E
5|$|Brazil {{has been}} elected ten times to the Security Council. It has contributed troops to UN {{peacekeeping}} efforts in the Middle East, the former <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo,</b> Cyprus, Mozambique, Angola, and more recently East Timor and Haiti. Brazil {{is one of the}} main contributors to the UN regular budget. Prior to the UN's founding in 1945, Franklin D. Roosevelt lobbied for Brazil to be included on the Security Council, but the UK and the Soviet Union refused.|$|E
5000|$|After the <b>Belgians</b> quit <b>Congo,</b> a {{civil war}} {{situation}} developed in that country. When the United Nations decided upon military intervention to retrieve the situation, India contributed a brigade of around 3000 men to the U.N. force. In November 1961, the U.N. Security Council decided {{to put a stop}} to the hostile activities of the Katangese troops in Congo. This greatly angered Tshombe, Katanga's secessionist leader, and he intensified his 'hate the UN' campaign. The result was more violence against UN personnel.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{creation}} of Belgium as a nation state, Belgian people have sought refuge abroad on several occasions. From {{the early days of}} independence and the threat of The Netherlands or France, to two World Wars and the Independence of <b>Congo,</b> <b>Belgians</b> have been on the run themselves, for various reasons, as refugees.|$|R
50|$|In 1961, {{he joined}} an International Red Cross {{expedition}} to the Congo. There he managed together with Gerry Joyce (another Australian surgeon) a District Hospital that had been abandoned by the <b>Belgians</b> following the <b>Congo</b> independence movement and revolution. The context was difficult, {{as a result of}} the period of turmoil of those years.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{no longer}} having {{authority}} {{in its own}} country, the government administered the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo</b> and held negotiations with other Allied powers about post-war reconstruction. Agreements made {{by the government in}} exile during the war included the foundation of the Benelux Customs Union and Belgium's admission into the United Nations. The government also exercised influence within the Belgian army-in-exile and attempted to maintain links with the underground resistance.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{went on to}} pen {{a string}} of Adventures of Tintin, sending his {{character}} to real locations such as the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo,</b> the United States, Egypt, India, China, and the United Kingdom. He also sent Tintin to fictional countries of his own devising, such as the Latin American republic of San Theodoros, the East European kingdom of Syldavia, or the fascist state Borduria—whose leader, Müsstler, {{was a combination of}} Nazi German leader Adolf Hitler and Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini.|$|E
5|$|Szilárd was {{concerned}} that German scientists might also attempt this experiment. The German nuclear physicist Siegfried Flügge published two influential articles on the exploitation of nuclear energy in 1939. After discussing this prospect with fellow Hungarian physicist Eugene Wigner, they decided that they should warn the Belgians, as the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Congo</b> was the best source of uranium ore. Wigner suggested that Albert Einstein might be a suitable person to do this, as he knew the Belgian Royal Family.|$|E
50|$|This {{violence}} immediately led to {{a military}} intervention into Congo by Belgium in an ostensible effort to secure the safety of its citizens (the earlier Luluabourg intervention had been against orders). The re-entry of these forces was a clear violation of the national sovereignty of the new nation, as it had not requested <b>Belgian</b> assistance (see <b>Congo</b> Crisis).|$|R
5000|$|In the 1920s and 1930s the Union Minière du Haut Katanga company, {{operating}} in the then <b>Belgian</b> colony of <b>Congo,</b> had a virtual monopoly of the world uranium market (holding most of the deposits known at the time). The uranium mined in Congo was mostly transported to the UMHK refinery for uranium ore which was located in Olen.|$|R
50|$|Le Mouvement Géographique was a {{geographical}} magazine published in Brussels from 1884 to 1922. It was initially edited by Alphonse-Jules Wauters, and primarily promoted and documented <b>Belgian</b> colonisation of <b>Congo.</b> From 1890, it {{was owned by}} the Compagnies du Congo pour le Commerce et l'Industrie. Another periodical edited by Wauters, Le Congo illustré, was folded into the Mouvement Géographique in 1896.|$|R
