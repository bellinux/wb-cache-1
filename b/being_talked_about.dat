Living in Dallas, Texas at the time, Sisler and his son Dave followed Ichiro's progress throughout the season. Both had mixed feelings about the record chase; they were happy that George Sisler's name was <b>being</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> and that people were re-discovering him as a player, but both were hoping that, if the record was not broken in 154games, {{there would be an}} asterisk noting that it took Ichiro more games to achieve it. Ichiro finished the season with 262hits, and the Mariners extended an invitation for the entire Sisler family to attend the celebration at Safeco Field. The younger Sisler was prevented by an emergency heart procedure from travelling to Seattle. Both remarked that the Mariners were a classy organization for extending the invitation.|$|E

2500|$|Logician and philosopher Alfred Tarski {{developed}} the theory for formal languages (such as formal logic). Here he restricted {{it in this}} way: no language could contain its own truth predicate, that is, the expression is true could only apply to sentences in some other language. The latter he called an object language, the language <b>being</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about.</b> (It may, in turn, have a truth predicate {{that can be applied}} to sentences in still another language.) The reason for his restriction was that languages that contain their own truth predicate will contain paradoxical sentences such as, [...] "This sentence is not true". As a result, Tarski held that the semantic theory could not be applied to any natural language, such as English, because they contain their own truth predicates. Donald Davidson used it as the foundation of his truth-conditional semantics and linked it to radical interpretation in a form of coherentism.|$|E

He was named in unofficial mid-year All-Australian teams by Mark Robinson and AFL Media and was named the tenth best midfielder in the league by Wayne Carey.

2500|$|Addressee honorifics {{express the}} social {{status of the}} person being spoken to (the hearer), {{regardless}} of what is <b>being</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about.</b> For example, Javanese has three different words for [...] "house" [...] depending on the status level of the person spoken to. Referent honorifics express {{the status of the}} person being spoken about. In this type of honorific, both the referent (the person being spoken about) and the target (the person whose status is being expressed) of the honorific expression are the same. This is exemplified by the T–V distinction present in many Indo-European languages, in which a different 2nd person pronoun (such as tu or vous in French) is chosen based on the relative social status of the speaker and the hearer (the hearer, in this case, also being the referent). Bystander honorifics express the status of someone who is nearby, but not a participant in the conversation (the overhearer). These are the least common, and are found primarily in avoidance speech such as the [...] "mother-in-law languages" [...] of aboriginal Australia, where one changes one's speech in the presence of an in-law or other tabooed relative.|$|E

2500|$|In the U.S. {{reviews of}} Brothers in Arms were more positive. Writing for Spin magazine, E.

That doesn't happen as often as I'd like on this new album by a band I've cared about for a long time, but I find myself returning to certain cuts the way one might come back to a favorite chair." [...] He singled out the [...] "haunting ballad" [...] "Your Latest Trick", the [...] "acerbic satire of vid-rock culture" [...] in [...] "Money for Nothing" [...] and the [...] "outstanding craftsmanship in the words and music" [...] of the title track, which was [...] "not a new message, but at least something other than sex, cars, or drugs is <b>being</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> here. Take that {{and the quality of the}} musicianship, and you've got a lot." [...] Debby Bull gave the album a mixed review for Rolling Stone magazine, praising the [...] "carefully crafted" [...] effort, writing, [...] "The record is beautifully produced, with Mark Knopfler's terrific guitar work catching the best light". Although she found the lyrics literate, Bull noted that the scenarios [...] "aren't as interesting as they used to be on records like Making Movies". Despite the production values and notable contributions from guest artists like drummer Omar Hakim and the Brecker Brothers, Bull concluded that [...] "the music lacks the ache that made Knopfler's recent soundtracks for Comfort and Joy and Cal so powerful." [...] In Rolling Stones end-of-year round-up of 1985's key albums, Fred Schruers said that [...] "Knopfler's nimble, evocative guitar style and gentle vocalizing are still as appealing as the were on previous scenario-rich albums".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1920s Browne began a {{speaking}} tour around the country, providing {{information about her}} beliefs {{on the need for}} accessibility of information about birth control for women, women’s health problems, problems related to puberty and sex education and high maternal morbidity rates among other topics. [...] These talks urged women to take matters of their sexuality and their health into their own hands. Birth control was an embarrassing issue because it would directly challenge relations between men and women too, making this control for women a touchy subject. [...] During this tour several women asked Browne for abortions, however as Jones recognizes in her article, Browne was not “medically qualified” and had to refuse them. Though she was becoming increasingly interested in women’s right to terminate their pregnancies, she would still be considered a “heretic” were she to say so at this time. [...] Despite this, in 1929 she brought forward her lecture “The Right to Abortion” in front of the World Sexual Reform Congress in London. [...] In the years leading up to the presentation of this paper, Browne worked to gather information on maternal mortality, and found that rates were higher than ever before in 1929, and became the secretary of the Chelsea Labour Party in hopes of bringing ideas of birth control and abortion to light in political platform in 1926. [...] She was unable to do so as she was forced to leave Chelsea later in 1926, as the Party was no longer recognized as a political Party. By the end of the 1920s, Browne had felt that the fight for birth control had become more successful, as it was more frequently seen in the public sphere and was now <b>being</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> and debated more openly. [...] In April 1930 the Birth Control Conference was a success bringing 700 delegates to attendance and bringing birth control into the political sphere, which she attended and spoke at. [...] In July 1930, the Ministry of Health issued MCW/153, which allowed local authorities to give birth control advice in welfare centres, another partial success for Browne.|$|E
