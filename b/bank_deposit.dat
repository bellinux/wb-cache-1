5|$|The Soviet {{monetary}} reform of 1991, {{commonly referred to}} as the Pavlov reform, was the last {{monetary reform}} prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Initiated on 22 January 1991, it was intended to withdraw money from circulation for reallocation to the production of consumer goods, which were in short supply. In a speech, Pavlov stated that the reason for the withdrawal was the government's belief that money was being sent to the Soviet Union from abroad, fuelling inflation. Although ridiculed by the Soviet press at the time, three years later the truth of Pavlov's statement was verified. Mikhail Gorbachev then signed a presidential decree ordering the Soviet financial system to stop accepting and exchanging banknotes issued in 1961. The directive also included 50-rouble and 100-rouble banknotes issued in 1991. On 23 January 1991, the government began restricting monthly <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> withdrawals to 500 rubles with the official explanation that this was to freeze the income of corrupt officials, capitalists and criminals.|$|E

40|$|The {{seasonal}} behaviour of <b>bank</b> <b>deposits</b> is to a {{large extent}} influenced by interest payments. In Italy this problem is particularly serious because, in the past, interests on <b>bank</b> <b>deposits</b> were paled only once a year (in December). The seasonally of <b>bank</b> <b>deposits</b> thus changes over time and it is highly correlated with the level of interest rates. This paper shows that the standard XllARIMA procedure is unable to remove seasonally from the series of Italian <b>bank</b> <b>deposits</b> and suggests several suitable alternatives...|$|R

The Monetary Authority of Macau regulates offshore finance, while the Macau Trade and Investment Promotion Institute provides services for investment in Macau. In 2007, Moody's Investors Service upgraded Macau's foreign and local currency government issuer ratings to 'Aa3' from 'A1', citing its government's solid finances as a large net creditor. The rating agency also upgraded Macau's foreign currency <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> ceiling to 'Aa3' from 'A1'.|$|E
25|$|In most legal systems, a <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> {{is not a}} bailment. In other words, {{the funds}} {{deposited}} {{are no longer the}} property of the customer. The funds become the property of the bank, and the customer in turn receives an asset called a deposit account (a checking or savings account). That deposit account is a liability on the balance sheet of the bank. Each bank is legally authorized to issue credit up to a specified multiple of its reserves, so reserves available to satisfy payment of deposit liabilities are less than the total amount which the bank is obligated to pay in satisfaction of demand deposits.|$|E

In the early 1970s, prior to entering the drug trade, Escobar acted as a thief and bodyguard, allegedly earning US $100,000 by kidnapping and holding a Medellín executive for ransom. Escobar began working for Alvaro Prieto, a contraband smuggler who operated around Medellín, aiming to fulfill a childhood ambition to have COL $1 million {{by the time he}} was 22. Escobar is noted for his <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> of COL $100 million (more than US $3 million), when he turned 26.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Based on a reduced-form {{equation}} {{derived from}} a simultaneous model of bank loan demand and supply, this study finds that the equilibrium bank loan has a negative relationship with the discount rate and the 10 -year U. S. government bond yield; it has a positive relationship with <b>bank</b> <b>deposits,</b> industrial production, appreciation of the yuan, and the inflation rate. A lower discount rate or more <b>bank</b> <b>deposits</b> will increase <b>bank</b> loan supply. Conversely, a higher discount rate or less <b>bank</b> <b>deposits</b> will reduce <b>bank</b> loan supply. Hence, the bank lending channel is confirmed...|$|R
25|$|Since 2009 Kenya's largest {{mobile phone}} company {{extended}} its mobile phone bank transaction payment system M-Pesa {{to be used}} for the payment of water utility bills. As of 2012 more than 12 million Kenyans and 85% of the urban population use mobile phones for Bank transactions. A study by the University of Oxford showed that prior to the introduction of this system residents of Kiamumbi on the outskirts of Nairobi had to make a 40-minute round trip on public transport, a wait in a lengthy queue to make a <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> and then present the slip at the offices of the water utility to pay their monthly bill. When the small utility serving the local water system allowed payments through M-Pesa in December 2010, within two months half their customers switched to the mobile phone payment system.|$|E

Recapitalisation refers to injecting money into banks so that they can meet their immediate obligations and resume lending, as was done in 2008 in the U.S. via the Troubled Asset Relief Programme.|$|E
2500|$|Common {{methods of}} Internet access by users include dial-up with a {{computer}} modem via telephone circuits, broadband over coaxial cable, fiber optics or copper wires, Wi-Fi, satellite and cellular telephone technology (3G, 4G). The Internet may often be accessed from computers in [...] libraries and Internet cafes. Internet access points exist in many public places such as airport halls and coffee shops. Various terms are used, such as public Internet kiosk, public access terminal, and Web payphone. Many hotels also have public terminals, though these are usually fee-based. These terminals are widely accessed for various usages, such as ticket booking, <b>bank</b> <b>deposit,</b> or online payment. Wi-Fi provides wireless access to the Internet via local computer networks. Hotspots providing such access include Wi-Fi cafes, where users need to bring their own wireless devices such as a laptop or PDA. These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based.|$|E

2500|$|The Banking Act of 1933 (the 1933 Banking Act) joined {{together}} two long-standing Congressional projects: (1) a federal system of <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> insurance championed by Representative Steagall and (2) the regulation (or prohibition) of {{the combination of}} commercial and investment banking and other restrictions on [...] "speculative" [...] bank activities championed by Senator Glass {{as part of a}} general desire to [...] "restore" [...] commercial banking to the purposes envisioned by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. [...] Although the 1933 Banking Act thus fulfilled Congressional designs and, at least in its deposit insurance provisions, was resisted by the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Administration, it later became considered part of the New Deal. The deposit insurance and many other provisions of the Act were criticized during Congressional consideration. [...] The entire Act was long-criticized for limiting competition and thereby encouraging an inefficient banking industry. Supporters of the Act cite it as a central cause for an unprecedented period of stability in the U.S. banking system during the ensuing four or, in some accounts, five decades following 1933.|$|E
