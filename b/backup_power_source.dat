50|$|This higher {{dependence}} on back-up/Load following power plants {{to ensure a}} steady power grid output has the knock-on-effect of more frequent inefficient (in e g/kW·h) throttling up and down of these other <b>power</b> <b>sources</b> in the grid to accommodate the intermittent <b>power</b> <b>source's</b> variable output.

50|$|The station {{continued}} to grow during the 1980s, but was somewhat hampered by problems with its signal. Unlike most NPR stations of the time, it had no <b>backup</b> <b>power</b> <b>source</b> for its transmitter, resulting in frequent outages.

To solve the problem, WFSU won approval for a new station on 88.9 FM, operating from a new tower northeast of Tallahassee. All NPR news and information programming moved there on October 14, 1990. Classical music remained on 91.5, which received new call letters, WFSQ.

50|$|A valve-regulated {{lead-acid}} battery (VRLA) is a battery type that is popular in telecommunications network environments as a reliable <b>backup</b> <b>power</b> <b>source.</b> VRLA batteries {{are used in}} the outside plant at locations such as Controlled Environmental Vaults (CEVs), Electronic Equipment Enclosures (EEEs), and huts, and in uncontrolled structures such as cabinets.GR-4228, VRLA Battery String Certification Levels Based on Requirements for Safety and Performance, is a new industry-approved set of VRLA requirements that provides a three-level compliance system. The compliance system provides a common framework for evaluating and qualifying various valve-regulated {{lead-acid battery}} technologies. The framework intends to alleviate the complexities associated with product introduction and qualification. For a VRLA, the quality system employed by the manufacturer is an important key to the overall reliability of it. The manufacturing processes, test and inspection procedures, and quality program used by a manufacturer should be adequate to ensure that the final product meets the needs of the end user, the application, and industry-accepted standards and processes (i.e., ANSI/IEC, TL9000, and GR-78, Generic Requirements for the Physical Design and Manufacture of Telecommunications Products and Equipment.|$|E
50|$|The {{dry dock}} was 91.5 metres long, 16.3 metres wide and 5.5 metres deep from water level. The pump {{machinery}} {{consisted of a}} main pump and additional centrifugal pump; they were operated by a single-cylinder 85−90-ihp steam engine and a Cornwall boiler, or two traction engines, which were used as <b>backup</b> <b>power</b> <b>source.</b> Leakage water was pumped out by Worthington pump. The wooden gate was designed {{in a similar way}} as the Swedish Oskarshamn dock gate and made by Ostrobothnian carpenters who had fled from their homes due to the prevailing famine. The gate launching ceremony took place on 13 November 1867 at 2−4 pm; the yard was decorated by flags and a large crowd witnessed the event. When the gate was lowered, it pushed away a large mass of water, and the gate foundation failed plunging the nearest bystanders into water; however, all of them were resqued to rowing boats. After the reinstalling the gate and inspection by authorities, the dock was ready to use. Another milestone was reached when the first docking took place in April 1868, again during presence of crowd. The vessel was steamship Constantin operated by Syd-Finska Kustångfartygbolaget.|$|E

Lead-acid batteries are finding considerable use as both primary and <b>backup</b> <b>power</b> <b>sources.</b> For complete battery utilization, the charger circuit must charge the battery to full capacity, while minimizing over-charging for extended battery life.
