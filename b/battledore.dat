2500|$|The {{history of}} sports in India {{dates back to}} the Vedic era. Physical culture in ancient India was fuelled by {{religious}} rights. The mantra in the Atharvaveda, says, [...] "Duty is in my right hand and the fruits of victory in my left." [...] In terms of an ideal, these words hold the same sentiments as the traditional Olympic Oath: [...] "For the Honour of my Country and the Glory of Sport." [...] Badminton probably originated in India as a grownup's version of a very old children's game known in England as <b>battledore</b> and shuttlecock, the <b>battledore</b> being a paddle and the shuttlecock a small feathered cork, now usually called a [...] "bird." [...] Games like chess (chaturanga), snakes and ladders, playing cards, originated in India, and it was from here that these games were transmitted to foreign countries, where they were further modernised.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{decided to}} stay and hold Khartoum despite the orders of the Gladstone {{government}} to merely report about the best means of supervising the evacuation of the Sudan. Powers who acted as Gordon's unofficial press attaché wrote in The Times: [...] "We are daily expecting British troops. We cannot bring ourselves {{to believe that we}} are to be abandoned". In his diary, Gordon wrote: [...] "I own to having been very insubordinate to Her Majesty's Government and its officials, but it is my nature, and I cannot help it. I fear I have not even tried to play <b>battledore</b> and shuttlecock with them. I know if I was chief I would never employ myself for I am incorrigible".|$|E

50|$|In 1856 he {{registered}} the first printed {{set of rules}} for the game of croquet and in 1860 printed a pamphlet called 'Badminton Battledore' {{a description of the}} ancient game of <b>battledores</b> and shuttlecocks as played competitively at Badminton House, the Duke of Beaufort's estate in Gloucestershire, England.|$|R

60|$|A {{month of}} plans, vicissitudes, and {{suspense}} followed, during which Amanda strove manfully; Matilda suffered agonies {{of hope and}} fear; and Lavinia remained a passive shuttlecock, waiting to be tossed wherever Fate's <b>battledore</b> chose to send her.|$|E

50|$|This game {{is played}} by two people, using small rackets, called <b>battledores,</b> made of {{parchment}} or rows of gut stretched across wooden frames, and shuttlecocks, made of a base of some light material, such as cork, with trimmed feathers fixed around the top. The object is for players to bat the shuttlecock {{from one to the}} other as many times as possible without allowing it to fall to the ground.|$|R

'Battledore and {{shuttlecock}}'s a wery good game, vhen you ain't the shuttlecock and two lawyers the <b>battledores,</b> {{in which case}} it gets too excitin' to be pleasant. Come avay, Sir.

60|$|The fates favoured Amy at {{last for}} about half after three, the billiards were interrupted, and Philip, pronouncing the rain to be almost over, invited Guy to take a walk, and they set out in a very gray wet mist, while Charlotte and Amy {{commenced}} a vigorous game at <b>battledore</b> and shuttle-cock.|$|E

60|$|While these {{victories}} and defeats {{were taking place}} in the course of time, many strange things happened at home. The young King, as he grew up, proved to be very unlike his great father, and showed himself a miserable puny creature. There was no harm in him--he had a great aversion to shedding blood: which was something--but, he was a weak, silly, helpless young man, and a mere shuttlecock to the great lordly <b>battledores</b> about the Court.|$|R
500|$|It is {{believed}} that around age twelve Yasohachi began to study with Toyohara (Ichiōsai) Chikanobu (not {{to be confused with}} [...] Kunichika’s student Toyohara Chikanobu). At the same time he designed actor portraits for <b>battledores</b> sold by a shop called Meirindo. His teacher gave him the name [...] "Kazunobu". It may have been on the recommendation of Chikanobu that the boy was accepted the following year as an apprentice in the studio of Utagawa Kunisada, the leading and most prolific print maker of the mid-19th century.|$|R
50|$|Experienced {{with both}} hornbooks and <b>battledores,</b> {{children}} graduated {{on to the}} modern concept of a small book, multiple paper pages covered with a thick, protective layer. Early reading booklets or religious primers contained both the alphabet and increasingly complicated lists of alphabetized syllables along with selected excerpts from the Bible. From tablet to booklet, the ABC format served as the most common framework for additional reading materials. The first church primers paralleled the introduction of school textbooks known as “the ABC”. Both colonial primers and ABC spellers employed the alphabet as an organizational feature for literacy instruction and spiritual study.|$|R
60|$|She {{had been}} a famous battledore-player in the {{galleries}} of Caergwent Castle; and once when she took up the <b>battledore</b> to give a lesson, it seemed as if, between her and Mrs. Lacy, the shuttlecock would not come down--they kept up five hundred and eighty-one, and then only stopped because {{it was necessary for}} her to go to dinner.|$|E
6000|$|Beside that {{significant}} wreck of a pen stood a little carriage clock in a case, and this suddenly lifted a slender voice and announced five. She turned round on her stool and sat {{staring at the}} clock. She smiled with {{the corners of her}} mouth down. [...] "Home," [...] she said, [...] "and begin again. It's like <b>battledore</b> and shuttlecock....|$|E
60|$|She {{could not}} {{conceive}} anyone {{being unable to}} play at <b>battledore,</b> and thought Kate's failures and dislike pure perverseness. Once Kate by accident knocked her shuttlecock through the window, and hoped she had got rid of it; but she was treated {{as if she had}} done it out of naughtiness, and a new instrument of torture, as she called it, was bought for her.|$|E
60|$|You rather entertained a notion, once, {{of coming}} to see me at Genoa. I shall return straight, on the 9th of December, {{limiting}} my stay in town to one week. Now couldn't you come back with me? The journey, that way, is very cheap, costing little more than twelve pounds; and I am sure the gratification to you would be high. I am lodged in quite a wonderful place, and would {{put you in a}} painted room, as big as a church and much more comfortable. There are pens and ink upon the premises; orange trees, gardens, <b>battledores</b> and shuttlecocks, rousing wood-fires for evenings, and a welcome worth having.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile, the want of {{the amount}} of air and running about to which she had been used, did really tell upon her; she had giddy {{feelings}} in the morning, tired limbs, and a weary listless air, and fretted over her lessons at times. So they showed her to the doctor, who came to see Lady Jane every alternate day; and when he said she wanted more exercise, her morning walk was made an hour longer, and a shuttlecock and <b>battledores</b> were bought, with which it was decreed that Mrs. Lacy should play with her for exactly half an hour every afternoon, or an hour when it was too wet to go out.|$|R
60|$|The sisters bravely set {{themselves}} to scramble among the rocks, each surface {{turned to the}} sea-breeze exquisitely and fantastically tinted by coloured lichens, and all interspersed with the classical acanthus' noble leaves, the juniper, and the wormwood. On they went, winding upwards as Bertha hoped, but also sideways, and their circuit had lasted a weary while, and made them exhausted and breathless, when looking round for their bearings, they found themselves in an enchanted maze of gray rocks, half hidden in myrtle, beset by the bristly <b>battledores</b> of prickly pear, and shaded by cork trees. Above was the castle, perched up, and apparently as high above them as when they began their enterprise; below was a steep descent, clothed with pines and adorned with white heaths. The place was altogether strange; they had lost themselves; Bertha began to repent of her adventure, and Maria was much disposed to cry.|$|R
60|$|In {{this latter}} respect Lord Ronald took after his father. From the start the lad had shown the {{greatest}} promise. At Eton {{he had made}} a splendid showing at <b>battledore</b> and shuttlecock, and at Cambridge had been first in his class at needlework. Already his name was whispered in connection with the All-England ping-pong championship, a triumph which would undoubtedly carry with it a seat in Parliament.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is right, nevertheless, Rosy, {{and so are}} you, for the {{two things}} go together, and in helping seven lads you are unconsciously doing much to improve one lass," [...] said Dr. Alec, {{stopping}} to nod and smile at the bright-faced figure resting on the old bamboo chair, after a lively game of <b>battledore</b> and shuttlecock, {{in place of a}} run which a storm prevented.|$|E
6000|$|So they two {{played at}} wordy <b>battledore</b> [...] And kept a curse {{forever in the}} air, [...] Flying this way or that from shore to shore; [...] No other labor did this holy pair, [...] Clothed and {{supported}} from the lavish store [...] Which crowds lanigerous brought with daily care; [...] They toiled not neither did they spin; their bias [...] Was tow'rd the harder task of being pious.|$|E
60|$|There now {{arose in}} Kent an Irishman, who gave himself {{the name of}} Mortimer, but whose real name was JACK CADE. Jack, in {{imitation}} of Wat Tyler, {{though he was a}} very different and inferior sort of man, addressed the Kentish men upon their wrongs, occasioned by the bad government of England, among so many <b>battledores</b> and such a poor shuttlecock; and the Kentish men rose up to the number of twenty thousand. Their place of assembly was Blackheath, where, headed by Jack, they put forth two papers, which they called 'The Complaint of the Commons of Kent,' and 'The Requests of the Captain of the Great Assembly in Kent.' They then retired to Sevenoaks. The royal army coming up with them here, they beat it and killed their general. Then, Jack dressed himself in the dead general's armour, and led his men to London.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{believed}} that around age twelve Yasohachi began to study with Toyohara (Ichiōsai) Chikanobu (not {{to be confused with}} Kunichika’s student Toyohara Chikanobu). At the same time he designed actor portraits for <b>battledores</b> sold by a shop called Meirindo. His teacher gave him the name [...] "Kazunobu". It may have been on the recommendation of Chikanobu that the boy was accepted the following year as an apprentice in the studio of Utagawa Kunisada, the leading and most prolific print maker of the mid-19th century.By 1854 the young artist had made his first confirmed signed print and had taken the name [...] "Kunichika", a composite of the names of this two teachers, Kunisada and Chikanobu. His early work was derivative of the Utagawa style and some of his prints were outright copies (an accepted practice of the time). While working in Kunisada's studio Kunichika was assigned a commission to make a print illustrating a bird's-eye view of Tenjinbashi Avenue following the terrible earthquake of 1855 that destroyed most of the city. This assignment suggests that he was considered one of Kunisada's better students.|$|R
60|$|It must be {{explained}} that Aunt Rosina, as Miss Houston was called, had been {{well acquainted with}} her nephew's earlier engagement, and had approved of Imogene as his future wife. Then had come the unexpected collapse in the uncle's affairs, by which Aunt Rosina {{as well as others}} in the family had suffered,--and Frank, much to his aunt's displeasure, had allowed himself to be separated from the lady of his love on account of his comparative poverty. She had heard of Gertrude Tringle and all her money, but from a high standing of birth and social belongings had despised all the Tringles and all their money. To her, as a maiden lady, truth in love was everything. To her, as a well-born lady, good blood was everything. Therefore, though there had been no quarrel between her and Frank, there had been a cessation of sympathetic interest, and he had been thrown {{into the hands of the}} <b>Battledores</b> and Shuttlecocks. Now again the old sympathies were revived, and Frank found it convenient to drink tea with his aunt when other engagements allowed it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Common sense {{will serve}} us {{better at the}} moment," [...] {{answered}} Wilding {{with a touch of}} sharpness. He turned to the frowning and perplexed Duke--whose mind was being tossed this way and that, like a shuttlecock upon the <b>battledore</b> of these men's words. [...] "Your Grace," [...] he said, [...] "forgive me that I speak it if hear it you will, or forbid me to say it if your resolve is unalterable in this matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{might play}} after our walk---and after tea; {{but it had}} to be quiet play, not real good games, even before Fly was ill---at least we did have some real games when Primrose came over, or when Cousin Rotherwood had us down in his study or in the hall; but Fly got tired, and knocked up very soon even then. Miss Elbury wanted us always to play <b>battledore</b> and shuttlecock, or Les Graces, if we couldn't go out.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fancy {{after all}} that fellow Houston going and marrying such a girl as Imogene Docimer, without a single blessed {{shilling}} to keep themselves alive." [...] This was said in the smoking-room of Houston's club by Lord John <b>Battledore</b> to Tom Shuttlecock; but it was said quite aloud, so that Houston's various acquaintances might be enabled to offer their remarks on so interesting a subject; and to express their pity for the poor object of their commiseration.|$|E
6000|$|But {{chief of}} all the addle-witted crew Conceded by the Hangman's League to you, The fool (his dam's acquainted with a knave) Whose fluent pen, of his no-brain the slave, Strews notes of {{introduction}} o'er the land And calls it hospitality--his hand May palsy seize ere he again consign To me his friend, as I to Hades mine! Pity the wretch, his faults howe'er you see, Whom A accredits to his victim, B. Like shuttlecock which <b>battledores</b> attack (One speeds it forward, one would drive it back) The trustful simpleton is twice unblest-- A rare good riddance, an unwelcome guest. The glad consignor rubs his hands to think How duty is commuted into ink; The consignee (his hands he cannot rub-- He has the man upon them) mutters: [...] "Cub!" [...] And straightway plans to lose him at the Club. You know, good Killer, where this dunce abides-- The secret jungle where he writes and hides-- Though no exploring foot has e'er upstirred His human elephant's exhaustless herd. Go, bring his blood! We'll drink it--letting fall A due libation to the gods of Gall. On second thought, the gods may have it all.|$|R
6000|$|Nevertheless, the {{children}} rejoiced greatly in the snow-storm. They {{had already made}} acquaintance with it, by tumbling heels over head into its highest drifts, and flinging snow at one another, as we have just fancied the Berkshire mountains to be doing. And now they {{had come back to}} their spacious play-room, which was as big as the great drawing-room, and was lumbered with all sorts of playthings, large and small. The biggest was a rocking-horse, that looked like a real pony; and there was a whole family of wooden, waxen, plaster, and china dolls, besides rag-babies; and blocks enough to build Bunker Hill Monument, and nine-pins, and balls, and humming tops, and <b>battledores,</b> and grace-sticks, and skipping-ropes, and more of such valuable property than I could tell of in a printed page. But {{the children}} liked the snow-storm better than them all. It suggested so many brisk enjoyments for to-morrow, and all the remainder of the winter. The sleigh-ride; the slides down hill into the valley; the snow-images that were to be shaped out; the snow-fortresses that were to be built; and the snowballing to be carried on! ...|$|R
60|$|Aided now {{a little}} by the planet, {{one of the}} consorts of the Richard, the Pallas, {{hovering}} far outside the fight, dimly discerned the suspicious form of a lonely vessel unknown to her. She resolved to engage it, if it proved a foe. But ere they joined, the unknown ship--which {{proved to be the}} Scarborough--received a broadside at long gun's distance from another consort of the Richard the Alliance. The shot whizzed across the broad interval like shuttlecocks across a great hall. Presently the <b>battledores</b> of both batteries were at work, and rapid compliments of shuttlecocks were very promptly exchanged. The adverse consorts of the two main belligerents fought with all the rage of those fiery seconds who in some desperate duels make their principal's quarrel their own. Diverted from the Richard and the Serapis by this little by-play, the Man-in-the-Moon, all eager to see what it was, somewhat raised himself from his trap-door with an added grin on his face. By this time, off sneaked the Alliance, and down swept the Pallas, at close quarters engaging the Scarborough; an encounter destined {{in less than an hour}} to end in the latter ship's striking her flag.|$|R
