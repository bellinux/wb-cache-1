40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of relaxation and thermalization in an exactly solvable model of a particle interacting with a harmonic oscillator bath. Our goal is to understand the effects of non-Markovian processes on the relaxational dynamics and to compare the exact evolution of the distribution function with approximate Markovian and Non-Markovian quantum kinetics. There are two different cases that are studied in detail: i) a quasiparticle (resonance) when the renormalized frequency of the particle is above the frequency threshold of the bath and ii) a stable renormalized `particle' state below this threshold. The time evolution of the occupation number for the particle is evaluated exactly using different approaches that yield to complementary insights. The exact solution allows us to investigate {{the concept of the}} formation time of a quasiparticle and to study the difference between the relaxation of the distribution of bare particles and that of quasiparticles. We derive a non-Markovian quantum kinetic equation which resums the perturbative series and includes off-shell effects. A Markovian approximation that includes off-shell contributions and the usual Boltzmann equation (energy conserving) are obtained from the quantum kinetic equation in the limit of wide separation of time scales upon different coarse-graining assumptions. The relaxational dynamics predicted by the non-Markovian, Markovian and <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>approximations</b> are compared to the exact result. The Boltzmann approach is seen to fail in the case of wide resonances and when threshold and renormalization effects are important. Comment: 39 pages, RevTex, 14 figures (13 eps figures...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of relaxation and thermalization in an exactly solvable model {{with the goal of}} understanding the effects of off-shell processes. The focus is to compare the exact evolution of the distribution function with different approximations to the relaxational dynamics: Boltzmann, non-Markovian and Markovian quantum kinetics. The time evolution of the distribution function is evaluated exactly using two methods: time evolution of an initially prepared density matrix and by solving the Heisenberg equations of motion. There are two different cases that are studied in detail: i) no stable particle states below threshold of the bath and a quasiparticle resonance above it and ii) a stable discrete exact `particle' state below threshold. For the case of quasiparticles in the continuum (resonances) the exact quasiparticle distribution asymptotically tends to a statistical equilibrium distribution that differs from a simple Bose-Einstein form as a result of off-shell processes. In the case ii), the distribution of particles does not thermalize with the bath. We study the kinetics of thermalization and relaxation by deriving a non-Markovian quantum kinetic equation which resums the perturbative series and includes off-shell effects. A Markovian approximation that includes off-shell contributions and the usual Boltzmann equation are obtained from the quantum kinetic equation in the limit of wide separation of time scales upon different coarse-graining assumptions.

40|$|Electronic {{devices are}} vital for our modern life. Semiconductor devices {{are at the}} core of them. Semiconductor devices are governed by the {{transport}} and behavior of electrons and holes which in turn are controlled by Fermi-Level or the Quasi-Fermi Level. The most frequently used approximation for the population of electrons and holes based on the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>approximation</b> of Fermi-Dirac distribution. However when the Fermi-level is closer to the majority carrier band edge, by less than 3 kT, it causes significant errors in the number of the carriers. This in turn causes errors in currents and other quantities of interest. In heavily doped semiconductors, it is desirable to use Fermi-Dirac Integral itself. However this is a tabulated function and therefore approximations are developed. Most of the approximation are mathematically cumbersome and complicated and they are not easily differentiable and integrable. Although several approximations have been developed, some with very high precision, these are not simple nor are they sufficiently useful in semiconductor device applications. In this thesis after exploring and critiquing these approximations, a new set of approximations is developed for the Fermi-Dirac integrals of the order 1 / 2. This analytical expression can be differentiated and integrated, still maintaining high accuracy. These new approximation {{is in the form of}} an exponential series with few terms using Prony’s method. Application of this approximation for semiconductor device calculations are discussed.

The observed baryon asymmetry can be realised for a breaking of the mass degeneracy as small as O(10 ^- 8).
