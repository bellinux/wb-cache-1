5|$|Exile was {{received}} well by critics; The Daily Telegraph {{called it the}} best game in the Myst series. Conversely, long-time critics of the series complained that Exile continued to prove that Mysts slower gameplay did not <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fast-paced modern game market; GameSpot editor Greg Kasavin described the Myst series as having lost its relevance. Despite selling {{more than one million}} copies within the first year of release, Exile fared poorer commercially than Myst and Riven, which had sold more than 10million copies combined. , the fourth game in the series, was developed and published solely by Ubisoft.|$|E
5|$|Group 3 is a {{group of}} {{elements}} in the periodic table. This group, like other d-block groups, should contain four elements, but it is not agreed what elements <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> group. Scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y) are always included, but the other two spaces are usually occupied by lanthanum (La) and actinium (Ac), or by lutetium (Lu) and lawrencium (Lr); less frequently, it is considered the group should be expanded to 32 elements (with all the lanthanides and actinides included) or contracted to contain only scandium and yttrium. When the group is understood to contain all of the lanthanides, its trivial name is the rare-earth metals.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{based on}} evidence from ITS and large subunit ribosomal RNA sequence data have not confirmed that Leucopholiota decorosa belongs in the Tricholomataceae family. However, the analysis does show it to be phylogenetically related to Phaeolepiota aurea, a species of unclear status in the Agaricales, and it confirms that L.decorosa does not <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family Agaricaceae. According to the species authors, L.decorosa would fit best in the Biannularieae tribe of the Tricholomataceae as described by Rolf Singer in his comprehensive monograph on the Agaricales. This tribe also contains the genera Catathelasma and Armillaria.|$|E

5|$|Whether the bigeye and {{smalltooth}} sand tigers <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{same family}} as the superficially similar {{sand tiger shark}} (C. taurus) has been debated among systematists, with morphological and dentitional studies giving inconsistent results. A 2012 molecular phylogenetic analysis, based on mitochondrial DNA, supported a sister species relationship between O. noronhai and O. ferox but not a clade consisting of Odontaspis and Carcharias. Instead, Odontaspis {{was found to be}} closer to the crocodile shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai), suggesting that it and Carcharias should be placed in separate families.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, the English {{scientist}} George Ernest Shelley {{used the}} spelling Necrospa in a book, thereby creating a junior synonym; however, he attributed {{the name to}} zoologist Philip Sclater. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway suggested that the Rodrigues starling should <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same genus as the hoopoe starling, Fregilupus, due to the similarity of the species. More subfossils found in 1974 added support to {{the claim that the}} Rodrigues bird was a distinct genus of starling. The stouter bill is mainly what warrants generic separation from Fregilupus. In 2014, the British palaeontologist Julian P. Hume described a new extinct species, the Mauritius starling (Cryptopsar ischyrhynchus), based on subfossils from Mauritius. It was shown to be closer to the Rodrigues starling than to the hoopoe starling, due to the features of its skull, sternum and humerus. Until then, the Rodrigues starling was the only Mascarene passerine bird named from fossil material.|$|E
5|$|The genus Carcharocles may be invalid, and {{the shark}} may {{actually}} <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Otodus, making it Otodus megalodon. A 1974 study on Paleogene sharks by Henri Cappetta erected the subgenus Megaselachus, classifying the shark as Otodus (Megaselachus) megalodon, along with O. (M.) chubutensis. A 2006 review of Chondrichthyes elevated Megaselachus to genus, and classified the sharks as Megaselachus megalodon and M. chubutensis. The discovery of fossils {{assigned to the}} genus Megalolamna in 2016 led to a re-evaluation of Otodus, which concluded that it is paraphyletic, that is, it consists of a last common ancestor {{but it does not}} include all of its descendants. The inclusion of the Carcharocles sharks in Otodus would make it monophyletic, with the sister clade being Megalolamna. There was one apparent description of the shark in 1881 classifying it as Selache manzonii.|$|E

5|$|The {{sculpture}} department comprises work created before 1850 {{that does}} not <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Etruscan, Greek, and Roman department. The Louvre has been a repository of sculpted material since its time as a palace; however, only ancient architecture was displayed until 1824, except for Michelangelo's Dying Slave and Rebellious Slave. Initially the collection included only 100pieces, {{the rest of the}} royal sculpture collection being at Versailles. It remained small until 1847, when Léon Laborde was given control of the department. Laborde developed the medieval section and purchased the first such statues and sculptures in the collection, King Childebert and stanga door, respectively. The collection was part of the Department of Antiquities but was given autonomy in 1871 under Louis Courajod, a director who organized a wider representation of French works. In 1986, all post-1850 works were relocated to the new Musée d'Orsay. The Grand Louvre project separated the department into two exhibition spaces; the French collection is displayed in the Richelieu wing, and foreign works in the Denon wing.|$|E

25|$|A {{different}} approach, {{this time}} based on sequences of nuclear histone H3 and mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) genes was proposed by Latiolais and colleagues in a 2006 paper.

25|$|In {{his more}} {{thorough}} 1992 description, Peng {{added a new}} species to the genus Agilisaurus. This species had previously been known as Yandusaurus multidens.

Previously divided into six subfamilies, a study of anatomical characters by Livezey suggests the Anatidae are better treated in nine subfamilies.

Annandale believed this bivalve was most similar to Corbula pfefferi (now Potamocorbula abbreviata), an Indian species. The species epithet mesopotamica refers to the species having been found in the Mesopotamian region.|$|E

25|$|As Bentham {{never visited}} Australia, {{he only had}} access to {{preserved}} specimens. Thus {{he was unable to}} distinguish between some similar pairs of species, and so reduced the number of species to 46. He retained Isostylis, but replaced Meissner's four series by four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters. Two of these, Oncostylis and Eubanksia, were reasonably well-defined and homogeneous; section Orthostylis was somewhat heterogeneous; section Cyrtostylis was erected to contain the species that did not <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other sections, and was therefore highly heterogeneous.|$|E
