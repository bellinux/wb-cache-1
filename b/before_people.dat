25|$|Pica is most {{commonly}} seen in pregnant women, small children, {{and those with}} developmental disabilities such as autism. Children eating painted plaster containing lead may suffer brain damage from lead poisoning. There is a similar risk from eating soil near roads that existed before tetraethyllead in petrol was phased out (in some countries) or <b>before</b> <b>people</b> stopped using contaminated oil (containing toxic PCBs or dioxin) to settle dust. In addition to poisoning, {{there is also a}} much greater risk of gastro-intestinal obstruction or tearing in the stomach. Another risk of eating soil is the ingestion of animal feces and accompanying parasites. Pica can also be found in other animals and is commonly found in dogs.|$|E
25|$|A {{fire alarm}} box is an outdoor device used for notifying a fire {{department}} of a fire. Early boxes used the telegraph system and were the main method of calling the fire department to a neighborhood in the days <b>before</b> <b>people</b> had telephones. When the box is triggered, a spring-loaded wheel spins and taps out a signal onto the fire alarm telegraph wire, indicating the box number. The receiver at a fire station then can match the number to the neighborhood. The municipal fire alarm system got its start in Massachusetts. It was invented by Moses G. Farmer, an engineer, and Dr. William Channing, a Harvard-educated Bostonian. Their revolutionary creation was installed in 1851 and consisted of 40 miles of wire and 45 boxes in Boston.|$|E
25|$|Polanski later stated that, in {{the months}} {{following}} the murders, he suspected various friends and associates, and his paranoia subsided only when the killers were arrested. Newspapers claimed that many Hollywood stars were moving out of the city, while others were reported to have installed security systems in their homes. Writer Dominick Dunne later recalled the tension:The shock waves that went through the town were beyond anything I had ever seen <b>before.</b> <b>People</b> were convinced that the rich and famous of the community were in peril. Children were sent out of town. Guards were hired. Steve McQueen packed a gun when he went to Jay Sebring's funeral. In 1994, the Tate/Polanski house was demolished and a new house was constructed on the site with the street address changed to 10066 Cielo Drive.|$|E

500|$|The {{rough edge}} of Dylan's singing was unsettling to some but an {{attraction}} to others. Joyce Carol Oates wrote: [...] "When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, {{the effect was}} dramatic and electrifying." [...] Many early songs reached the public through more palatable versions by other performers, such as Joan Baez, who became Dylan's advocate {{as well as his}} lover. Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him on stage during her concerts. [...] "It didn't take long <b>before</b> <b>people</b> got it, that he was pretty damned special," [...] says Baez.|$|E

5000|$|The pleonastic {{article is}} {{widespread}} among languages in the area, {{as far north}} as Troms. A pleonastic article, similar to the vocative is always put <b>before</b> <b>people's</b> names, pet's names, and words like e.g. father and mother. e.g. [...] "‘n far å a’ mor" [...] (mum and dad). The pleonastic article differs between feminine (a’) and masculine (‘n) nouns.|$|R
500|$|<b>Before</b> <b>people</b> could gravitate towards {{areas of}} work that matched their names, many people were given names that matched their area of work. The way people are named has changed over time. In pre-urban times people were only known by a single name [...] for example, the Anglo-Saxon name Beornheard. Single names were chosen for their meaning or given as nicknames. In England {{it was only after}} the Norman conquest that {{surnames}} were added, although there were a few earlier bynames that were not hereditary, [...] such as Edmund Ironside. Surnames were created to fit the person, mostly from patronyms (e.g., John son of William becomes John Williamson), occupational descriptions (e.g., John Carpenter), character or traits (e.g., John Long), or location (e.g., John from Acton became John Acton). Names were not initially hereditary; only by the mid-14th century did they gradually become so. Surnames relating to trades or craft were the first to become hereditary, as the craft often persisted within the family for generations. The appropriateness of occupational names has decreased over time, because tradesmen did not always follow their fathers: an early example from the 14th century is [...] "Roger Carpenter the pepperer".|$|E
500|$|A comment he {{made during}} the debate became another {{campaign}} issue for Thompson. He again apologized for remarks, this time over an {{answer to a question}} in which he stated that he believed the decision to fire a gay worker based on the morals of the employer is something that should be [...] "left up to the individual business." [...] A few days following the debate, the candidate rescinded the comments, and blamed the gaffe on a malfunctioning hearing aid, stating that he [...] "didn't hear the question." [...] Thompson also said that he was sick during the debate, having been hospitalized three days earlier with the flu and bronchitis, and that all he could think about [...] "was getting off the stage." [...] Campaign adviser Steve Grubbs would later point to this episode as the moment Thompson's campaign became [...] "unrecoverable." [...] Thompson was harshly criticized for the remarks. Jason Stephany, the political director of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, rhetorically asked [...] "How many times is he going to say something that's completely offensive to the majority of Americans <b>before</b> <b>people</b> start to say, 'What's going on here?'" [...] Thompson tried to reassure the public that there was [...] "nothing discriminatory about [...] at all." [...] Afterwards, he finished second in a poll of state convention members from Wisconsin, with 84 of the 306 members polled, trailing Fred Thompson who received 95 votes. He stood at 16% in an average of statewide polls for the state in May, and stood at 4.3% in Iowa, where he based his campaign.|$|E

2500|$|At the assemblies, {{working group}} {{proposals}} {{are made to}} meeting participants, who comment upon them using a process called a stack; a queue of speakers that anyone can join. In New York City, Occupy Wall Street uses {{what is called a}} progressive stack, in which people from marginalized groups are sometimes allowed to speak <b>before</b> <b>people</b> from dominant groups, with facilitators, or stack-keepers, urging speakers to [...] "step forward, or step back" [...] based on which group they belong to, meaning that women and minorities get to go {{to the front of the}} line, while white males must often wait for a turn to speak.

2500|$|There are {{two views}} {{as to the}} cause of Nancy Hanks Lincoln's death. [...] One view is that she died of [...] "milk sickness." [...] Several people died that Fall from the illness, {{including}} Elizabeth and Thomas Sparrow, who raised her and then lived with on the Lincoln's property at the Little Pigeon Creek settlement. The Sparrows died in September, weeks before Nancy's death, and Dennis moved in with the Lincolns. [...] It was caused by settlers drinking the milk or eating the meat of cows that had eaten the white snakeroot. [...] The plant contains the potent toxin temetrol, which is passed through the milk. The migrants from the East were unfamiliar with the Midwestern plant and its effects. In the nineteenth century <b>before</b> <b>people</b> understood the cause of the illness, thousands in the Midwest died of milk sickness.|$|E
2500|$|In Rowntree's work, he {{surveyed}} rich families in York {{and drew a}} poverty line {{in terms of a}} minimum weekly sum of money [...] "necessary to enable families... to secure the necessaries of a healthy life" [...] (quoted in Coates and Silburn, 1970). The money needed for this subsistence level of existence covered fuel and light, rent, food, clothing, and household and personal items, adjusted according to family size. He determined this level using social scientific methods which hadn't been applied to the study of poverty before. For example, he consulted leading nutritionists of the period to discover the minimum calorific intake and nutritional balance necessary <b>before</b> <b>people</b> got ill or lost weight. [...] He then surveyed the prices of food in York to discover what the cheapest prices in the area for the food needed for this minimum diet were and used this information to set his poverty line.|$|E

[...] Simon of the Daily Mirror quipped that Malick was [...] "just what the doctor ordered" [...] to counterbalance the programme's weaker males.
