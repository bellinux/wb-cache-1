5|$|In 1918, Fred Whitlam was {{promoted}} to deputy Crown solicitor and transferred to Sydney. The family lived first in the North Shore suburb of Mosman and then in Turramurra. At age six, Gough began his education at Chatswood Church of England Girls' School (early primary schooling at a girls' school was not unusual for small <b>boys</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time). After a year there, he attended Mowbray House School and Knox Grammar School, {{in the suburbs of}} Sydney.|$|E
5|$|A {{school day}} at the orphanage would start at 6:00a.m. with many morning chores to be completed, predominately cleaning. A mass would be held at 7:15a.m., and breakfast would follow. <b>Boys</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> orphanage would then go to school. All boys over 14 were given a {{religious}} education at the Brother's Cathedral School, whereas the younger boys attended the infants' school at the Convent. All boys were also trained in technical education. Before leaving, the orphanage trained the boys in all classes of agriculture. This was so the boys were well educated and had the knowledge to become sufficient farmers {{when they left the}} orphanage.|$|E

5|$|Himmler's first name, Heinrich, {{was that}} of his godfather, Prince Heinrich of Bavaria, {{a member of the}} royal family of Bavaria, who had been tutored by Gebhard Himmler. He {{attended}} a grammar school in Landshut, where his father was deputy principal. While he did well in his schoolwork, he struggled in athletics. He had poor health, suffering from lifelong stomach complaints and other ailments. In his youth he trained daily with weights and exercised to become stronger. Other <b>boys</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> school later remembered him as studious and awkward in social situations.|$|E
5|$|In February 1918, he was {{appointed}} Officer in Charge of <b>Boys</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Royal Naval Air Service's training establishment at Cranwell. With {{the establishment of the}} Royal Air Force two months later and the reassignment of Cranwell from Admiralty to Air Ministry responsibility, Albert transferred from the Royal Navy to the Royal Air Force. He {{was appointed}} Officer Commanding Number 4 Squadron of the Boys' Wing at Cranwell until August 1918, before reporting to the RAF's Cadet School at St Leonards-on-Sea. He completed a fortnight's training and took command of a squadron on the Cadet Wing. He was the first member of the royal family to be certified as a fully qualified pilot.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in several locations. In France, Super Bear Studios was used between January and July1979, with Waters recording his vocals at the nearby Studio Miraval. Michael Kamen supervised the orchestral arrangements at CBS Studios in New York, in September. Over {{the next two months}} the band used Cherokee Studios, Producers Workshop and The Village Recorder in Los Angeles. A plan to work with the Beach <b>Boys</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Sundance Productions studio in Los Angeles was cancelled. For a week in November they worked at the Producers Workshop.|$|E

5|$|After Driberg {{had risen}} to {{responsible}} positions within the school (deputy head boy, head librarian, and chief sacristan, among others), his Lancing career ended suddenly {{in the autumn of}} 1923, when two boys complained about his sexual overtures. To avoid distressing the widowed Amy Driberg (John Driberg had died in 1919), the headmaster allowed him to remain in the school {{for the remainder of the}} term, stripped of his offices and segregated from all social contact with other <b>boys.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of the term he was required to leave, on the pretext that he needed private tuition to pass his Oxford entrance examination which he had failed the previous summer. Back in Crowborough, after several months' hard application under the guidance of his tutor, the future Lord Justice Pearson, Driberg won a classics scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album began on May 1, 1979 at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Gold Star Studios had become famous through its history with artists like Eddie Cochran and the Beach <b>Boys.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> Ramones' request, Ed Stasium {{helped with the}} album's engineering. During the studio work, Spector's recording methods were different from those the Ramones were accustomed to from their four previous studio albums. The band recorded their earlier compositions in the shortest time possible for the lowest feasible budget, with a relatively low production value. With End of the Century, the band experienced Spector's infamous perfectionism, and a budget of $200,000 to fully record and produce the album. This is significant because the band's debut album cost $6,400 total, and their second album cost $10,000. End of the Century {{is the most expensive}} album in the Ramones' career.|$|E

25|$|The Junior Chronicle and The Chronicle are the {{official}} School magazines, the latter having been founded in 1863. Both are edited by <b>boys</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> School. Although liable to censorship, {{the latter has}} a tradition of satirising and attacking School policies, as well as documenting recent events. The Oppidan, founded in 1828, was published once a Half; it covered all sport in Eton and some professional events as well, but no longer exists.|$|E
25|$|After {{the war in}} {{his studio}} at Ybl Bazár in Budapest he created statues: the Corpus Hungaricum, Attila József the poet and Sorrow of Mother among others.

This activity has been recognized and honored by the British Museum.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, Golovkin {{purchased}} a beige-colored VAZ-2103 car, which he stored {{in his garage}} where he began constructing a basement, originally {{to be used as}} a workshop, however he realized it could be used as a dungeon to commit his sexual crimes. From August 1990, Golovkin killed eight boys aged 10 to 15-years-old, on two occasions torturing two <b>boys</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time. In September 1992, Golovkin raped and killed three boys who he had lured into his garage, offering to commit theft from a warehouse. The last of them Golovkin tortured and raped for 12 hours and then hung up before he went to work.|$|E
25|$|Adulthood {{was reached}} {{at the age}} of 18, and the young adult (eiren) {{initially}} served as a trainer for the <b>boys.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, the most promising youths were included in the Krypteia. At 20, Spartans became eligible for military service and joined one of the messes (syssitia), which included 15 men of various ages. Those who were rejected retained a lesser form of citizenship, as only the soldiers were ranked among the homoioi. However, even after that, and even during marriage and until about the age of 30, they would spend most of their day in the barracks with their unit. Military duty lasted until the 60th year, but there are recorded cases of older people participating in campaigns in times of crisis.|$|E
25|$|The first Captain of Boats {{recorded}} in Tacchella's Register was appointed in 1862. The first {{reference to the}} Derby Grammar School Boat Club appears in an advertisement in the Derby Mercury of June 3, 1863, which mentions the Rev. T.H.L. Leary, Headmaster at the time, providing trophies for competition amongst <b>boys</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> school at the forthcoming regatta. The original Derby School boathouse was situated just upstream of the Derwent Rowing Club's own Club House {{on the west side}} of the river Derwent. The school boat club was closed shortly after the death in 1889 of the headmaster, the Rev. Walter Clark. For 41 years no rowing activities took place at the school. It is recorded there was conflict within the school that rowing was attracting more members than the cricket club was prepared to allow and therefore responsible for bringing pressure to bear which resulted in the demise of rowing.|$|E
