50|$|In {{exchange}} for {{his involvement in the}} Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, he was appointed Ontario's chief coroner in 1961.

In the view of observers, Dempster's column in his last years lost its bite, and in his industry he was considered something of a relic: [...] "by now a brand rather than a journalistic asset". Paul Dacre, who succeeded Sir David English as editor of the Mail in 1992, reportedly held a low opinion of Dempster's column, and revived the 'Ephraim Hardcastle' feature, under the responsibility of Dempster's old colleague on the Eye Peter McKay, in 1996.|$|R
500|$|He was {{in charge}} for the first game at the Walkers Stadium. Despite a good start to their campaign, the club fell into the relegation zone in the new year. Adams was clearly resentful of lucrative long term {{contracts}} dealt out to his less talented players by previous managers, which restricted his ability to bring in fresh faces to boost their campaign. Leicester slipped back down again in 2003–04 to 18th place, bracketed together with the two other relegated sides — Leeds United and Wolverhampton Wanderers — whose goal difference was inferior to Leicester's. The [...] "Foxes" [...] were becoming a [...] "yo-yo club" [...] and Adams blamed this on a lack of investment. During March 2004 nine Leicester players were arrested for various offences related to a drunken outing that ended with an alleged sexual assault on three German tourists, with three players being charged: Paul Dickov, Frank Sinclair and Keith Gillespie. The three faced up to fourteen years in prison if found guilty of rape, and the trio's bail totalled £196,500. The club had already been rocked by various incidents on overseas tours over years, with Stan Collymore arrested for setting off a fire extinguisher in 2000, and Dennis Wise breaking Callum Davidson's jaw in a row over a card game in 2002. Adams had previously initiated a crackdown in club discipline, {{going so far as}} to enforce random <b>breathalyser</b> tests. Adams said that [...] "in a lot of people's eyes, the players are guilty before they have had a fair trial – which is not the case". The incident also cast doubt over Adams' future at the club, as reports surfaced that he planned to quit the club. He did in fact offer his resignation, which was rejected by the club. However, he kept faith in his players' innocence, and claimed [...] "if they are guilty of anything it is of being unprofessional – of being drunk to excess". His faith was later vindicated when it transpired that all allegations against the players were false.|$|E

40|$|The {{methods of}} {{teaching}} statistical inference vary and too often, insufficient links are made to the achievement of students. Many of the underlying ideas are counter-intuitive, {{as illustrated by the}} well-known examples of Kahneman and Tver-sky, and Gigerenzer. Recent testing of able students will be discussed. Simulations can also play a part, as demonstrated with an example from real-life of <b>breathalysers.</b> The ideas of decision-making are not particularly deep and complex, but the application of ideas in practice proves to be difficult. For example it is not simple to use ideas of utility in conjunction with probability, where the differences are quite subtle and need practice to be well understood. Students find it hard to apply the expected utility theo-rem and ideas of the probability premium in insurance. They are also perplexed by Arrow‟s theorem showing that simple and intuitive conditions for voting lead to con-tradictions, undermining the idea of a fair ballot.

40|$|The Netherlands Transport Research Centre (AVV) of the Dutch Ministry of Public Works {{commissioned}} the SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research {{to perform a}} study into alcohol locks. These locks are <b>breathalysers</b> which are fitted between the ignition and the starting motor of a car. Although the idea of fitting an alcohol lock originated in the early 1960 s, the equipment has been technically perfected since that time. The present generation of alcohol locks is equipped with advanced devices {{in order to prevent}} deception. Some countries have already imposed quality standards on alcohol locks. Experience abroad has taught that alcohol locks are effective in the short term. The literature reports extensively about various alcohol lock programmes conducted in the United States, Canada, and Australia. In The Netherlands, {{there is a need for}} an alternative method to tackle drink driving. The notorious offender should not only have an alcohol lock fitted in his car, but should also be intensively supervised by a social worker. It was concluded that it would be of benefit to conduct an experiment with alcohol locks in The Netherlands. Sufficient knowledge is available to design an experiment linked to an effectivity study. This experiment would only be useful, however, if the user is also subjected to intensive supervision. (A...|$|R

AlcoSense launched a disposable <b>breathalyser</b> specifically for use in France: the AlcoSense Singles NF, certified to meet all French specifications.In 2015 AlcoSense launched the AlcoSense Pro and in 2016 the AlcoSense Ultra. Both use fuel cell sensors. The AlcoSense Ultra uses the same fuel-cell sensor as several police breathalysers but does not carry UK Home Office approval. They contained a number of unique new features that advise the user if they are blowing correctly, provided an estimated time until sober, and they can work with any drink-drive limit anywhere in the world. By selecting a country from a pre-loaded list, the unit will automatically set itself up to the local drink-drive limit. In particular the time until sober had been questioned by medical experts.|$|E
