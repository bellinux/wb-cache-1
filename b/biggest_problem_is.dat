500|$|The New York Times {{film critic}} Bosley Crowther noted {{the film was}} a subtle satire on Beatlemania and the Beatles themselves. The Beatles are portrayed as likeable young lads who are {{constantly}} amazed at the attention they receive and who want {{nothing more than a}} little peace and quiet; however, {{they have to deal with}} screaming crowds, journalists who ask nonsensical questions, and authority figures who constantly look down upon them. In fact their <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> McCartney's elderly, but [...] "clean" [...] grandfather, played by Wilfrid Brambell. The New Yorker critic Brendan Gill wrote: [...] "Though I don't pretend to understand what makes these four rather odd-looking boys so fascinating to so many scores of millions of people, I admit that I feel a certain mindless joy stealing over me as they caper about uttering sounds." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Ragan, who was {{involved}} in the race's largest accident, [...] "Everybody was real racy and I just got into the back of Menard. You get a good run, and you're pushing a little bit, and I guess he was pushing whoever was in front of him. And when you've got the meat in between the sandwich, you usually get wrecked." [...] Harvick blamed the accident on drivers who had little experience of pack racing: [...] "The <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the tandem racing has been so easy for these guys to stay attached that some of them haven't raced in pack racing. It's {{going to take a lot}} more patience from a lot of guys who haven't done this before." [...] Nevertheless, Menard thought that the pack style of racing would be a good combination for the Daytona 500 and believed it would be [...] "chaotic" [...] and [...] "exciting". Four days after the race, NASCAR announced that the pressure relief values in the engine would be increased from [...] to [...] after some drivers complained of overheating issues while they were running in packs. The race had a television audience of 7.46million viewers.|$|E
500|$|... "Sparks Fly" [...] is {{a country}} pop song with a length of four minutes and 22 seconds. The song, written solely by Swift, is in the key of D minor with Swift's vocals {{spanning}} two octaves, from F3 to C5. Johnathan Keefe claimed that [...] "the a capella [...] "Drop everything now" [...] exclamation simply commands attention, with the desperation in Swift’s call-to-action answering the common criticisms that her work is sexless and chaste." [...] Bobby Peacock stated that [...] "I wouldn't mind if the banjo from the 2007 version were left in, but its omission is [...] hardly make-or-break. Perhaps my <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that the song's chorus undermines itself {{in the second half}} – it starts out emphatic [...] and anthemic as usual, but there's just no [...] "oomph" [...] on the hook. It almost feels as if she's trailing off mid-sentence." [...] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 stated [...] ""Sparks Fly" [...] centers around a simple but effective hook—"I see sparks fly whenever you smile"—that further cements Swift’s reputation as one the craftiest songwriters in popular music." [...] Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country commented on the chorus of the song stating, [...] "Though Swift implies that this particular crush is a [...] "bad idea," [...] she still insists that they should try to make it work in the chorus: [...] "Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain / Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain / ‘Cause I see sparks fly / Whenever you smile," [...] she sings insistently." ...|$|E

2500|$|Untener also {{organized}} {{a series of}} preaching seminars for priests. [...] At the 1993 National Conference of Bishops, Untener reportedly interrupted the proceedings by commenting on how many people felt bored during Mass. [...] Untener told a reporter, [...] "They {{were talking about the}} niceties of phrases - debating whether `prince' or `ruler' was a better word to use in the lectionary..." [...] Untener stood up and shouted, [...] "The <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> not whether we use `prince' or `ruler.' The <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the Mass is boring for most people." [...] Untener encouraged priests to stick to one point in their homilies and to keep their talks at seven minutes or less.|$|E

2500|$|Patrick Goldstein, {{writing in}} the Los Angeles Times, said [...] "The picture's <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that it simply doesn't capture the {{chilling}} intensity of its source material," [...] and noted {{that there was a}} [...] "largely lackluster early reaction" [...] to the film by most film critics. Most felt that while the novel portrayed Hanna's illiteracy as a metaphor for generational illiteracy about the Holocaust, the film failed to convey those thematic overtones.|$|E
2500|$|Delinda Deline (Molly Sims) is Ed and Jillian's {{daughter}} and the entertainment/food and beverage manager {{for all the}} food and beverage outlets in the Montecito: the Mystique Club, the former Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, Opus Bar, and the Bella Petto Pool Bar. Delinda is also shown to have a genius-level IQ, and once majored in psychology, but decided the human race's <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that they are boring. Delinda {{has also been shown}} to be fluent in French, in the season-four episode, [...] "The Burning Bedouin". Delinda leaves the Montecito in the beginning of season three, until Monica forces Ed to hire her back. She becomes Danny's girlfriend after a long and complicated romantic history with him. [...] They are [...] "involved" [...] briefly for the first episodes of season one before calling it off. During season three, an old college flame returns and asks Delinda to marry him. She accepts, but before the ceremony, Ed is shot. In the fray of Ed's medical crisis, Delinda calls off her wedding to Derek. At the end of the season-five finale, Delinda becomes overwhelmed with pain after just learning that A.J. Cooper is alive; he was supposedly killed in a plane crash. Jillian is with her, and Delinda begins bleeding.|$|E

2500|$|Despite, and at {{the same}} time {{precisely}} because of, its claim of authority on the English language, the Oxford English Dictionary has been criticised since at least the 1960s from various angles. It has become a target precisely because of its scope, its claims to authority, its British-centredness and relative neglect of World Englishes, its implied but not acknowledged focus on literary language and, above all, its influence. The OED, as a commercial product, has always had to manoeuvre a thin line between PR, marketing and scholarship and one can argue that its <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the critical uptake of the work by the interested public. In his review of the 1982 supplement, University of Oxford linguist Roy Harris writes that criticizing the OED is extremely difficult because [...] "one is dealing not just with a dictionary but with a national institution", one that [...] "has become, like the English monarchy, virtually immune from criticism in principle". He further notes that neologisms from respected [...] "literary" [...] authors such as Samuel Beckett and Virginia Woolf are included, whereas usage of words in newspapers or other less [...] "respectable" [...] sources hold less sway, even though they may be commonly used. He writes that the OEDs [...] "lack-and-white lexicography is also black-and-white in that it takes upon itself to pronounce authoritatively on the rights and wrongs of usage", faulting the dictionary's prescriptive rather than descriptive usage. To Harris, this prescriptive classification of certain usages as [...] "erroneous" [...] and the complete omission of various forms and usages cumulatively represent the [...] "social bias" [...] of the (presumably well-educated and wealthy) compilers. However, the identification of [...] "erroneous and catachrestic" [...] usages is being removed from third edition entries, sometimes in favour of usage notes describing the attitudes to language which have previously led to these classifications.|$|E
2500|$|There was, {{by early}} 2007, some {{perception}} that Jean's schedule was seemingly thinner {{than that of}} her predecessors; an initial explanation of fatigue was further detailed by the Secretary to the Governor General as thyroid problems, and that the vicereine's doctor had advised rest after Jean's previously hectic diary. At the same time, some in the Ottawa Press Gallery opined that Jean had on a few occasions {{in the previous year}} overstepped the boundaries of an office that was expected to remain non-partisan; journalist Chantal Hébert said that the Governor General had [...] "been wading uncommonly deep in political territory over the past few months," [...] citing Jean's criticism of Quebec sovereigntists and her expressed support for the mission of Canadian troops in Afghanistan. Further, Michael Valpy penned a piece in The Globe and Mail critiquing Jean for inviting who Valpy described as [...] "potentially politically charged individuals" [...] to post on her Citizen Voices website. Jean had also made, at the roast-like annual National Press Gallery dinner, satirical remarks about Parti Québécois leadership candidate André Boisclair's admitted cocaine use and, in a September 18, 2006 interview regarding a proposed subsidy for Canadians to travel domestically, she commented that Quebecers [...] "are sometimes very disconnected from the rest of Canada" [...] and that their isolation affected Canada's unity. Jean later clarified her opinion by adding that Canadians from all provinces were disconnected {{from other parts of the}} country, and a September 26 editorial in the Montreal Gazette supported Jean's statements on the divisions between Canada's peoples, saying that supporting national unity was a part of a governor general's mandate; but, the ire of Quebec separatist politicians was not assuaged. Further, the content of a speech by Jean to mark the 25th anniversary of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms was regarded as thinly veiled criticism of her Cabinet's decision to end the Court Challenges Program and, into 2007, it was reported that Jean's staff at Rideau Hall had been systematically removing royal portraits from the walls of the residence. All of this prompted Valpy to reveal that, early in his time as prime minister, Stephen Harper was told by Alex Himelfarb, then the Clerk of the Privy Council: [...] "Prime Minister, your <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> in Rideau Hall," [...] meaning Jean and her potential to be a [...] "loose cannon".|$|E
