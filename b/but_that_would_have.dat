5|$|The {{team had}} {{originally}} {{wanted to create}} the game's boss battles in-house around the game's similar elements of player choice, with their initial design inspired by the boss fights in Metal Gear Solid. As the development on the story and gameplay framework took priority, boss battles became less and less of a focus. It eventually reached a point when the main development team could not complete them {{in time for the}} game's release. The team contemplated cutting them, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> negatively impacted the story and other areas of the game's design. In the end, development of the boss battles was outsourced to Grip Entertainment. Having been given access to the game's engine, Grip Entertainment were given the task of creating the boss battles and incorporating them into the framework of Human Revolution. For this, they needed to incorporate their own technology into the system, working from Eidos' specifications while bringing their own development style to bear on the project. They also attempted to balance the boss fights' action-focused approach with the other elements within Human Revolution so it would be accessible to all players.|$|E

25|$|The air {{offensive}} against the RAF and British industry failed {{to have the}} desired effect. More might have been achieved had OKL exploited the vulnerability of British sea communications. The Allies did so later when Bomber Command attacked rail communications and the United States Army Air Forces targeted oil <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> required an economic-industrial analysis of which the Luftwaffe was incapable. OKL instead sought clusters of targets that suited the latest policy (which changed frequently) and disputes within the leadership were about tactics rather than strategy. Though militarily ineffective, the Blitz cost around 41,000 lives, may have injured another 139,000 people and did enormous damage to British infrastructure and housing stock.|$|E

25|$|The starry {{ceiling is}} astronomically {{inaccurate}} {{in a complicated}} way. While the stars within some constellations appear correctly as they would from earth, other constellations are reversed left-to-right, as is the overall arrangement of the constellations on the ceiling. For example, Orion is correctly rendered, but the adjacent constellations Taurus and Gemini are , with Taurus near Orion's raised arm where Gemini should be. One {{possible explanation is that}} the overall ceiling design might have been based on the medieval custom of depicting the sky as it would appear to God looking in at the celestial sphere from outside, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> reversed Orion as well. A more likely explanation is partially mistaken transcription of the sketch supplied by Columbia Astronomy professor Harold Jacoby. Though the astronomical inconsistencies were noticed promptly by a commuter in 1913, they have not been corrected in any of the subsequent renovations of the ceiling.|$|E
25|$|United's chances {{continued}} to flow thick and fast. Michael Carrick rounded the goalkeeper {{only to be}} tackled on the line by Distin, whilst Patrice Evra had a shot turned onto the post by David James before things went {{from bad to worse}} for the Manchester side. With 12 minutes to play, Portsmouth counter-attacked down the right hand side, forcing a two-on-two situation. The ball was squared to Milan Baroš, who was felled by Kuszczak in the box. The referee had no hesitation in sending Kuszczak off, despite both Rooney and Anderson having gotten back behind the ball before the foul. Nevertheless, referee Atkinson's decision meant that United had no recognised goalkeeper available for the remaining time. Wayne Rooney offered his services, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> left United without a recognised centre-forward, so Rio Ferdinand was given the responsibility of attempting to save the penalty. However, although he dived the right way, Ferdinand was unable to get a hand to the ball, and Sulley Muntari gave Portsmouth the lead. United fought hard to get their deserved equaliser, but even Ronaldo's free kick was off-target, and United were knocked out of the FA Cup.|$|E

Hans Beimler, who converted Danus' story into a teleplay, was aware of the mythology of the Grail as he wrote the script and wanted to avoid giving the sword any mystical or magical powers. He said that [...] "It's the concept of the sword that has the power. We could have said that some technology or magic gave the Klingons the feeling of power, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a cheap way to go."

Rather than risk delaying the completion of the ships the machinery from HMS Tiger was duplicated with the addition of three extra boilers to provide the required power needed for the additional speed. Each ship had two paired sets of Brown-Curtis direct-drive steam turbines, housed in separate engine-rooms. Each set comprised high-pressure ahead and astern turbines driving an outboard shaft and low-pressure ahead and astern turbines, housed in the same casing, driving an inner shaft.

500|$|The area {{underneath}} the London Eye where the Doctor and Rose confront the Nestene Consciousness was filmed in an unused paper mill in Grangetown, Cardiff. It underwent steam cleaning {{because there were}} such high health and safety concerns. They were only permitted to film for three days, which required {{that some of the}} sequence be cut: originally, there was to be another Auton Mickey involved. Special effects producer Mike Tucker was reminded of the James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun when reading the scene in which the Nestene's lair is blown up, and sought to display it as a major effect. The production team built a one-sixth scale model of the warehouse where the explosions were filmed. Tucker did a model explosion for the destruction of Henrik's as well, although that was only for the roof; the rest was done by CGI. The production team considered doing the explosion practically, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been too expensive. In the original script, Rose's first experience of seeing the TARDIS interior was shared with the audience. Director Keith Boak, however, wanted her to exit and run around the TARDIS before entering again, at which point the interior would be revealed to the audience. This change was eventually embraced by the executive producers. Davies remarked that he originally wanted to take Rose and the audience inside the TARDIS in all one shot, but this was not a feasible with the budget. This effect would later be accomplished in the 2012 Christmas special, [...] "The Snowmen".|$|E
500|$|Following the assassinations, Serbian Ambassador to France Milenko Vesnić and Serbian Ambassador to Russia Spalaiković put out {{statements}} {{claiming that}} Serbia had warned Austria-Hungary {{of the impending}} assassination. Serbia soon thereafter denied making warnings and denied knowledge of the plot. [...] Prime Minister Pašić himself made these denials to Az Est on 7 July and to the Paris Edition of the New York Herald on 20 July. Other voices eventually spoke out on the “warning”. As Serbian Education Minister Ljuba Jovanović wrote in Krv Sloventsva, in late May or early June, Prime Minister Pašić reviewed {{the plot of the}} impending assassination with members of his cabinet. On 18 June, a telegram, lacking in specifics, ordered Serbia's Ambassador to Vienna, Jovan Jovanović, to warn Austria-Hungary that Serbia had reason to believe there was a conspiracy to assassinate Franz Ferdinand in Bosnia. On 21 June, Ambassador Jovanović met with Austro-Hungarian Finance Minister Bilinski. [...] According to Serbian Military Attaché to Vienna, Colonel Lesanin, Ambassador Jovanović, spoke to Bilinski and [...] "...stressed in general terms the risks the Archduke heir apparent might run from the inflamed public opinion in Bosnia and Serbia.

His journey might give rise to incidents and demonstrations that Serbia would deprecate <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> fatal repercussions on Austro-Serbian relations." [...] Jovanović came back from the meeting with Bilinski and told Lesanin that [...] "...Bilinski showed no sign of attaching great importance to the total message and dismissed it limiting himself to remarking when saying goodbye and thanking him: [...] 'Let us hope nothing does happen.'" [...] The Austro-Hungarian Finance Minister took no action based on Jovanović's remarks.|$|E

2500|$|The plaintiffs did {{not argue}} that making Aboriginal {{children}} attend a church run institution was {{the imposition of}} religious observance, but that the system of spiritual beliefs and practices of the Aboriginal people was a religion and the laws prohibited Aboriginal children from {{the free exercise of}} that religion by separating them from indigenous culture. The Bringing Them Home report had found that Aboriginal children were removed because their Aboriginality was 'a problem' and to prevent the children from acquiring Aboriginal `habits', culture and traditions. This argument was rejected by the High Court, with the majority, BrennanCJ, DawsonJ, TooheyJ, and GummowJ, holding section 116 was directed to the purpose of a law and not to the effect of the law, and that the challenged laws did not have the purpose of restricting the practise of religion. held that [...] none of the laws had that prohibited purpose. GaudronJ agreed with the majority that section 116 was directed to the purpose of the legislation, but {{that the purpose of the}} 1918 Ordinance could not be determined on the material before the High Court.

2500|$|In 1958 life {{looked good}} for Peter May of Charterhouse, Cambridge, Surrey and England; his county had been County Champions {{for seven years}} running, with May the captain {{for the last two}} seasons, and England had never been {{defeated}} under his leadership. Vice-captain on the triumphant tour of Australia in 1954-55 he had beaten South Africa 3-2 in 1955, considered by many to have been the most exciting Test series since the war, Australia 2-1 in 1956, the West Indies 3-0 in 1957 and New Zealand 4-0 in 1958. He was widely regarded as the best post-war batsman England produced, tall, strong and disciplined with a near-perfect technique, a straight bat and a complete range of strokes. His standards improved with the responsibilities of captaincy and his Test average as captain was [...] His greatest century was against the West Indies in 1957 when England followed on 288 runs behind at , he made 285 not out, the highest score by an England captain until Graham Gooch's , adding 411 with Colin Cowdrey (154) - still an England record for any wicket - and destroyed the mesmerising hold the spinner Sonny Ramadhin had over English batsmen. In the low scoring Ashes series of 1956 he had made 453 runs (90.60) and was out only once for less than 50, when he made 43. Although himself a highly educated amateur and a gentleman he realised that the old class divisions in English cricket were breaking down and under Len Hutton's leadership the amateur and professional had merged. He enjoyed the complete loyalty of the team and the selectors and was ready to help his players and smooth down feathers. As a captain he was a strict team disciplinarian who expected high standards, he was ruthless when the occasion demanded, but could be inflexible and unimaginative and lacked the charisma of a natural leader. In 1958-59 he played too defensively and surrendered the initiative to readily to Benaud as he concentrated on saving runs instead of trying to get batsmen out. Faced with Meckiff's bowling in the disastrous First Test he declined to make an official complaint as it would appear unsporting and sour grapes. A more ruthless captain may have resolved this problem {{at the start of the}} series, even at the loss of Tony Lock, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> damaged Anglo-Australian cricketing relations. After the Australian tour May beat New Zealand 1-0, India 5-0 and led England to its first series victory in the West Indies 1-0. He lost 2-1 to the 1961 Ashes series and retired due to ill-health having been captain in a then record 41 Tests, Richie Benaud being the only man to defeat him in a Test series.|$|E
