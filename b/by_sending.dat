5|$|At the Eastern Gate, Thomas {{assembled}} more forces than at {{the other}} gates, so that Khalid {{would be unable to}} move to Shurahbil's assistance and take command in that decisive sector. Thomas' attack at several gates also gave more flexibility to the operation: if success were achieved in any sector other than the Gate of Thomas, such success could be exploited <b>by</b> <b>sending</b> troops to that sector to achieve the breakthrough. Thomas ordered Khalid to be taken alive.|$|E

5|$|Civil {{war broke}} out again in England in 1215 between forces loyal to King John and rebel barons, {{supported}} in due course by Prince Louis of France.

Despite John's death, the war continued until forces loyal to John's young son, Henry III, finally achieved victory over the rebels in 1217.|$|E
5|$|Criticisms of Abercrombie {{begin with}} his {{reliance}} on relatively poor intelligence. Reports reached {{him that the}} French strength at Carillon was 6,000, and that a further 3,000 were expected. Many of these reports were from French deserters or captives, and Abercrombie should have investigated them <b>by</b> <b>sending</b> out scouts or light infantry. Even if the reports were accurate, Abercrombie's army still significantly outnumbered that of Montcalm. The same sources must also have reported the shortage of provisions at the fort, a sign that a siege would have ended quickly.|$|E
5|$|Despite Swedish {{hopes that}} the Dutch would not enter the conflict, they honored their 1649 treaty <b>by</b> <b>sending</b> a 45-ship relief fleet.

Wrangel suggested the Swedes should attack, but Charles X still wanted to avoid provoking the Dutch.|$|E

5|$|During the 1830s, the Mexican {{government}} wavered between federalist and centralist policies. As {{the pendulum}} swung sharply towards centralism in 1835, several Mexican states revolted.

5|$|During the Quasi-War, the United States {{paid tribute}} to the Barbary States {{to ensure that they}} would not seize or harass American {{merchant}} ships.

Thomas Jefferson responded <b>by</b> <b>sending</b> a squadron of warships to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and to pursue peace with the Barbary States.|$|E
5|$|During these years, Harrison {{exhibited}} {{a number of}} personality quirks that became legendary.

Usually the topics were intellectual rather than related to the running of the railroad. Another oddity was his refusal to use his railroad pass, which entitled him to free travel. Instead, he personally paid for his commute between his home and the railroad's offices.|$|E
