5|$|Apart {{from the}} typical colouration, Djungarian hamsters {{can also be}} {{coloured}} pearl, sapphire, sapphire pearl, and marbled. Other colorations are available, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> strongly suspected to appear only in hybrid crossings with Campbell's dwarf hamsters. Some of these colorations are mandarin, blue, argente, yellow blue fawn, camel, brown, cream, merle, and umbrous.|$|E
5|$|Both {{bacteria}} and eukaryotes, but not archaea, make spores. Some species of Haloarchaea undergo phenotypic switching and grow as several different cell types, including thick-walled structures that {{are resistant to}} osmotic shock and allow the archaea to survive in water at low salt concentrations, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> not reproductive structures and may instead help them reach new habitats.|$|E
5|$|Canada's federal {{structure}} divides government responsibilities {{between the}} federal government and the ten provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons. Canada's three territories also have legislatures, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces. The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.|$|E

5|$|Intermediate birds occur {{where the}} {{recognised}} forms meet and interbreed, and have sometimes been given subspecies status, including S. b. kreczmeri in Poland and S. b. pateffi in Bulgaria, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> not generally accepted as valid taxa.|$|E
5|$|Like most {{plants of}} {{agricultural}} importance, several subspecies and varieties of P.sativa have been described, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> mostly no longer recognized as independent taxa, but rather, morphological {{variations of the}} same taxon.|$|E
5|$|Magnesium-poor adakites {{have been}} found at Monte Burney. Fueguino {{volcanic}} rocks also include adakites <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> richer in magnesium. These adakitic magmas reflect the subduction of a relatively hot and young Antarctic Plate. In the case of Monte Burney, these magmas then underwent some fractionation during ascent, as it was retarded by the tectonic regimen, which is somewhat compressive.|$|E

5|$|Opposable thumbs {{allowing}} the grasping of objects {{are most often}} associated with primates, like humans, monkeys, apes, and lemurs. Opposable thumbs also evolved in pandas, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> completely different in structure, having six fingers including the thumb, which develops from a wrist bone entirely separately from other fingers.|$|E
5|$|Social housing {{represents}} {{a little more}} than 17 percent of the city's total residences, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> rather unevenly distributed throughout the capital: the vast majority of these are concentrated in a crescent formed by Paris's south-western to northern periphery arrondissements.|$|E
5|$|The +3 {{oxidation}} state {{is known in}} compounds like manganese(III) acetate, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> quite powerful oxidizing agents and also prone to disproportionation in solution, forming manganese(II) and manganese(IV). Solid compounds of manganese(III) are characterized by its strong purple-red color and a preference for distorted octahedral coordination resulting from the Jahn-Teller effect.|$|E

50|$|It also {{proposed}} in 2009 to operate services from London King's Cross to Scarborough via the Yorkshire Coast Line, Skegness, Sheffield via Grantham, Grimsby and Middlesbrough, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> rejected in 2010 by the ORR. It was {{also proposed}} in December 2013 that services would run services between Kings Cross and Skipton, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> withdrawn in 2014 by the ORR.|$|R

5|$|While domesticated rats are not removed {{enough from}} their wild {{counterparts}} {{to justify a}} distinct subspecies (compare Canis lupus familiaris), there are significant differences that set them apart; the most apparent is coloring. Random color mutations may occur in the wild, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> rare. Most wild R. norvegicus are a dark brown color, while fancy rats may be anything from white to cinnamon to blue.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are {{omnivorous}} and forage in {{wetlands and}} saltwater marshes. They tear up {{the ground with}} their powerful beaks in search of bulbs and edible roots. Northern populations mainly eat tubers of the bulkuru sedge (Eleocharis dulcis) which they extract by digging holes in the mud, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> not available south of Brisbane. They also eat the shoots and leaves of wetland and upland plants, cereal grains, seeds, insects, mollusks, crustaceans, frogs and lizards. In saltwater marshes they may drink saline water and they have glands near their eyes through which they can excrete excess salt.|$|E

5|$|Commemorative coins with €2 {{face value}} {{have been issued}} with changes {{to the design of}} the {{national}} side of the coin. These include both commonly issued coins, such as the €2 commemorative coin for the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, and nationally issued coins, such as the coin to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics issued by Greece. These coins are legal tender throughout the eurozone. Collector coins with various other denominations have been issued as well, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> not intended for general circulation, and they are legal tender only in the member state that issued them.|$|E
5|$|Factory-based {{industry}} {{accounted for}} an estimated 29.7% of GDP in 2009. More than 75% of Cameroon's industrial strength is located in Douala and Bonabéri. Cameroon possesses substantial mineral resources, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> not extensively mined (see Mining in Cameroon). Petroleum exploitation has fallen since 1986, but {{this is still a}} substantial sector such that dips in prices have a strong effect on the economy. Rapids and waterfalls obstruct the southern rivers, but these sites offer opportunities for hydroelectric development and supply most of Cameroon's energy. The Sanaga River powers the largest hydroelectric station, located at Edéa. The rest of Cameroon's energy comes from oil-powered thermal engines. Much of the country remains without reliable power supplies.|$|E
5|$|High {{figures for}} tanks lost {{during the battle}} have been widely {{attributed}} to the Germans, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> incorrect. For example, Rotmistrov in his postwar accounts of the battle stated that the Germans lost 350–400 tanks, including 70 Tigers, and 3,500–10,000 soldiers on 12 July, and a Soviet General Staff study of the Battle of Kursk reported that the Germans lost 300 tanks, 20 assault guns and over 4,500 soldiers in the battle from 12 to 16 July inclusive. However, archival data of the German units involved show that much lower losses were incurred during the battle.|$|E
