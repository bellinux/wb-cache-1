5|$|The {{proposed}} {{bond issue}} went ahead in July 2006. Arsenal issued £210million worth of 13.5-year bonds with a spread of 52 <b>basis</b> <b>points</b> over government bonds and £50million of 7.1-year bonds with a spread of 22 <b>basis</b> <b>points</b> over LIBOR. It {{was the first}} publicly marketed, asset-backed bond issue by a European football club. The effective interest rate on these bonds is 5.14% and 5.97%, respectively, and are due to be paid back over a 25-year period; the move to bonds has reduced the club's annual debt service cost to approximately £20million a year. In September 2010, Arsenal announced that the Highbury Square development – {{one of the main}} sources of income to reduce the stadium debt – was now debt free and making revenue.|$|E

Furthermore, governments of Member States where central banks currently hold Greek government bonds in their investment portfolio commit to pass on to Greece an amount equal to any future income until 2020.

40|$|Abstract The {{proposed}} {{method for}} low-dimensional illumination space representation (LDISR) of human faces {{can not only}} synthesize a virtual face image when given lighting conditions but also estimate lighting conditions when given a face image. The LDISR {{is based on the}} observation that 9 <b>basis</b> <b>point</b> light sources can represent almost arbitrary lighting conditions for face recognition application and different human faces have a similar LDISR. The principal component analysis (PCA) and the nearest neighbor clustering method are adopted to obtain the 9 <b>basis</b> <b>point</b> light sources. The 9 basis images under the 9 <b>basis</b> <b>point</b> light sources are then used to construct an LDISR which can represent almost all face images under arbitrary lighting conditions. Illumination ratio image (IRI) is employed to generate virtual face images under different illuminations. The LDISR obtained from face images of one person can be used for other people. Experimental results on image reconstruction and face recognition indicate the efficiency of LDISR. Key words LDISR, basis image, illumination ratio image, face recognition...|$|R

Owing to data availability, we restrict the analysis of mortgage pricing to Italian households.

40|$|Institutional {{brokerage}} {{rates have}} been in decline. We investigate whether this reduction has coincided with a fall in benefits provided by brokers to institutional asset managers.

We find that later period active funds recoup a combined 1. 75 <b>basis</b> <b>point</b> benefit (from price impact cost recovery and short-term alpha) per <b>basis</b> <b>point</b> of brokerage cost. Later period active investors saw improved trade price impact and shorter-term alpha net benefits, relative to earlier period active investors.

When a card is stolen, or an unauthorized duplicate made, most card issuers will refund {{some or all of}} the charges that the customer has received for things they did not buy. These refunds will, in some cases, be at the expense of the merchant, especially in mail order cases where the merchant cannot claim sight of the card. In several countries, merchants will lose the money if no ID card was asked for, therefore merchants usually require ID card in these countries. Credit card companies generally guarantee the merchant will be paid on legitimate transactions regardless of whether the consumer pays their credit card bill.|$|E
25|$|On 27 March 2012, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) {{signed an}} {{agreement}} to lend $250 million to BMRC to part-finance Phase 2 of the metro rail project.

25|$|The main number {{which is}} used to assess the value of the bond is the gross {{redemption}} yield. This is defined such that if all future interest and principal repayments are discounted back to the present, at an interest rate equal to the gross redemption yield (gross means pre-tax), then the discounted value is equal to the current market price of the bond (or the initial issue price if the bond is just being launched). Fixed income investments such as bonds and loans are generally priced as a credit spread above a low-risk reference rate, such as LIBOR or U.S. or German Government Bonds of the same duration. For example, if a 30-year mortgage denominated in US dollars has a gross redemption yield of 5% per annum and 30 year US Treasury Bonds have a gross redemption yield of 3% per annum (referred to as the risk free yield), the credit spread is 2% per annum (sometimes quoted as 200 <b>basis</b> <b>points).</b> The credit spread reflects the risk of default. Risk free interest rates are determined by market forces and vary over time, based on a variety of factors, such as current short-term interest rates, e.g. base rates set by central banks such as the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England in the UK, and the Euro Zone ECB. If the coupon on the bond is lower than the yield, then its price will be below the par value, and vice versa.|$|E
