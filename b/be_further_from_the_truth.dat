5|$|Women {{were not}} {{explicitly}} banned from voting in Great Britain until the 1832 Reform Act and the 1835 Municipal Corporations Act. In England the suffrage movement existed {{before and after}} the 1832 act, but did not form a national organisation until the creation of the National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1872. Although there were notable exceptions such as the working-class areas of Lancashire, the women's suffrage movement in England was predominantly a middle-class movement. In Wales there were only two narrow bands of wealthy society in the Anglicised north and south coastal areas. Much of the female population of an emerging 19th century Wales was based in the low-waged, densely-populated, industrialised valleys of the south. At first women found work in metalworking and coal extraction, but then faced mass unemployment after the 1842 Mines and Collieries Act had prohibited them from working underground. The coal mining industry, with its absence of pithead baths, led to unpaid women's employment as the need to keep both their homes and the family's menfolk clean became a never ending task. This led to the image of the stoic Welsh Mam, a matriarch of the home, but little could <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> in a society controlled by men.|$|E

25|$|The recent anti-Latin resentment in the Empire {{led to the}} Crusader states {{losing their}} {{protection}} from Byzantium. However, whilst the Crusader states should not and did not rely on Byzantium for protection, the Byzantines certainly did in that it kept the aggressive expansionism of Islam in check. This could not <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> {{in regards to the}} Principality of Antioch. With the fall of Jerusalem in 1187 to Saladin it was Western Europe that immediately posed a threat to the Empire. A new Crusade was declared by the recently elected Pope Gregory VIII.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a popular}} {{misconception}} among the general public that most Jews went to their deaths passively. Nothing could <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> Jewish resistance to the Nazis comprised not only their armed struggle but also spiritual and cultural opposition which gave the Jews dignity despite the inhumane conditions {{of life in the}} ghettos. Many forms of resistance were present, even though the elders were terrified by the prospect of mass retaliation against the women and children in the case of anti-Nazi revolt. As the German authorities undertook to liquidate the ghettos, armed resistance was offered in over 100 locations on either side of Polish-Soviet border of 1939, overwhelmingly in eastern Poland. The uprisings erupted in 5 major cities, 45 provincial towns, 5 major concentration and extermination camps, as well as in at least 18 forced labor camps. Notably, the only rebellions in Nazi camps were Jewish.|$|E
500|$|Zeta Psi ("Zete") at Dartmouth College {{was founded}} in 1853 as the Psi Epsilon chapter of the {{national}} fraternity, and was the fifth fraternity founded at the college. [...] The fraternity became inactive in 1863, but was revived from 1871 through 1873 after which it again became inactive. [...] The current Psi Epsilon Chapter of Zeta Psi at Dartmouth was established in 1920. [...] In 2001, the Dartmouth chapter was derecognized by the college because [...] "the fraternity harassed specific fellow students and violated ethical standards that Dartmouth student organizations agree to uphold, by periodically creating and circulating among Zeta Psi members 'newsletters' that purported to describe situations, some of them of a sexual nature, of various members of the fraternity and other students." [...] Zeta Psi, meanwhile, countered that [...] "nothing could <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth...</b> Dartmouth College lacks jurisdiction to punish Psi Epsilon of Zeta Psi's for alleged violations of its own rules or regulations,". [...] From 2001 to 2006, Zeta Psi continued to operate as an independent fraternity, not officially recognized by Dartmouth College. In January 2007, Dartmouth College announced an agreement that would allow Zeta Psi to reorganize on campus as early as 2009. Part of the agreement dictated that the organization [...] "go dark", with no activities or recruiting, for a period of two years. [...] During these two years, alumni raised millions of dollars and the physical plant was entirely gutted and renovated, with a three-story addition being constructed on the west-side of the house. Also, the basement was enlarged. [...] On October 12, 2009, the Psi Epsilon Association of Zeta Psi Fraternity (Dartmouth Zete's alumni association) announced that 35 undergraduates had joined the newly re-recognized fraternity. [...] , after only little more than a year, Zete has around 60 brothers and counting.|$|E

[...] The Connecticut Democratic Party filed an FEC complaint against Linda McMahon's campaign in October, claiming the WWE's [...] "Fan Appreciation Day" [...] was an [...] "illegal campaign contribution". The complaint also cited the taping of [...] "Smackdown in Bridgeport Harbor Yard" [...] on Election Day, claiming it intended to suppress voter turnout in a Democratic-leaning community.|$|E
2500|$|Contrary to George Will's [...] "Al Gore's Green Guilt" [...] Roger Revelle—our {{father and}} the [...] "father" [...] of the {{greenhouse}} effect—remained deeply concerned about global warming {{until his death in}} July 1991. That same year he wrote: [...] "The scientific base for a greenhouse warming is too uncertain to justify drastic action at this time." [...] Will and other critics of Sen. Al Gore have seized these words to suggest that Revelle, who was also Gore's professor and mentor, renounced his belief in global warming. Nothing could <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> When Revelle inveighed against [...] "drastic" [...] action, he was using that adjective in its literal sense—measures that would cost trillions of dollars. Up until his death, he thought that extreme measures were premature. But he continued to recommend immediate prudent steps to mitigate and delay climatic warming. Some of those steps go well beyond anything Gore or other national politicians have yet to advocate. [...] Revelle proposed a range of approaches to address global warming. Inaction was not one of them. He agreed with the adage [...] "look before you leap," [...] but he never said [...] "sit on your hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{feel as if}} I had {{not done}} her justice, and {{as if she might}} seem stern, unsympathising, and lacking in tenderness. Yet nothing could <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> She was an old-fashioned mother, who held it her duty to keep up her authority, and counted over- {{familiarity}} and indulgence as sins. To her 'the holy spirit of discipline was the beginning of wisdom,' and to make her children godly, truthful, and honourable was a much greater object than to win their love. And their love she had, and kept to a far higher degree than {{seems to be the case}} with those who court affection by caresses and indulgence. We knew that her approval was of a generous kind, we prized enthusiastically her rare betrayals of her motherly tenderness, and we depended on her in a manner we only realised in the desolation, dreariness, and helplessness that fell upon us, when we knew that she was gone. She had not, nor had any of us, understood that she was dying, and she had uttered only a few words that could imply any such thought. On hearing that there was a letter from Clarence, she said, 'Poor Clarence! I should like to have seen him. He is a good boy after all. I've been hard on him, but it will all be right now. God Almighty bless him!' ...|$|E

60|$|Brandeis {{had held}} all day by Mulinuu, expecting the {{reported}} real attack. He woke on the 13th {{to find himself}} cut off on that unwatered promontory, and the Mataafa villagers parading Apia. The same day Fritze {{received a letter from}} Mataafa summoning him to withdraw his party from the isthmus; and Fritze, as if in answer, drew in his ship into the small harbour close to Mulinuu, and trained his port battery to assist in the defence. From a step so decisive, it might be thought the German plans were unaffected by the disastrous issue of the battle. I conceive nothing would <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> Here was Tamasese penned on Mulinuu with his troops; Apia, from which alone these could be subsisted, {{in the hands of the}} enemy; a battle imminent, in which the German vessel must apparently take part with men and battery, and the buildings of the German firm were apparently destined to be the first target of fire. Unless Becker re-established that which he had so lately and so artfully thrown down--the neutral territory--the firm would have to suffer. If he re-established it, Tamasese must retire from Mulinuu. If Becker saved his goose, he lost his cabbage. Nothing so well depicts the man's effrontery as that he should have conceived the design of saving both,--of re-establishing only so much of the neutral territory as should hamper Mataafa, and leaving in abeyance all that could incommode Tamasese. By drawing the boundary where he now proposed, across the isthmus, he protected the firm, drove back the Mataafas out of almost all that they had conquered, and, so far from disturbing Tamasese, actually fortified him in his old position.|$|E
