50|$|In 1973 it was proven for {{the first}} time that {{polyester}} degrades when disposed in bioactive material such as soil. Polyesters are water resistant and can be melted and shaped into sheets, bottles, and other products, making certain plastics now available as a biodegradable product. Following, polyhydroxylalkanoates (PHAs) were produced directly from renewable resources by microbes. They are approximately 95% cellular bacteria and can be manipulated by genetic strategies. The composition and biodegradability of PHAs can be regulated by blending it with other natural polymers. In the 1980s the company ICI Zenecca commercialized PHAs under the name <b>Biopol.</b> It was used for the production of shampoo bottles and other cosmetic products. Consumer response was unusual.

Fibronectin (FN) was used as substrate for cell attachment. for both cell types, this fucan has shown a dose-dependent anti-adhesive effect, reaching saturation at around 400 mu g/mL. This effect was abolished by desulfation of the fucan. in addition, this polymer exhibited the highest inhibitory effect in comparison to other sulfated polysaccharides. the fucan was biotinylated and used as a probe to identify its action sites. Biotinylated fucan was detected in the extracellular matrix environment by confocal microscopy and flow cytometric analysis, {{but not at the}} cell surface. the results suggest that the fucan shows anti-adhesive activity by binding directly to FN, and blocking FN sites that are recognized by cell surface ligands, possibly the integrin family.

Here, a sulfated galactan was isolated from the species Codium isthmocladum and its structure was studied by a combination of chemical analyses and NMR spectroscopy. Two fractions (SG 1, similar to 14 kDa, and SG 2, similar to 20 kDa) were derived from this highly polydisperse and heterogeneous polysaccharide. Both exhibited similar structures in (1) H 1 D NMR spectra. the structural features of SG 2 and its desulfated derivative were analyzed by COSY, TOCSY, DEPT-HSQC, HSQC, and HMBC. This sulfated galactan is composed preponderantly of 4 -sulfated, 3 -linked beta-D-galactopyranosyl units. in minor amounts, it is sulfated and glycosylated at C- 6. Pyruvate groups are also found, forming five-membered cyclic ketals as 3, 4 -O-(1 ' carboxy) ethylidene-beta-D-galactose residues.

30|$|The limited {{carbohydrate}} utilization {{range of}} R. eutropha {{coupled with the}} high costs of these carbon sources in biopolymer production restricts its application in biotechnological processes. Renewable substitutes for the so far used expensive substrates must be investigated to lower the commercial PHA production costs (e.g. of the thermoplastic <b>Biopol)</b> to make them competitive with the petrochemical-based plastic manufacture. Based on the experimental results, it appears that polymer accumulation in strain H 16 is reduced to a minor extend when cells were grown on glycerol (70.7 %, w/w, PHB after 260 h of cultivation) in comparison to accumulation experiments made on sodium gluconate or fructose (up to 78 %, w/w, PHB after 28 h of cultivation, Kaddor and Steinbüchel 2011). We demonstrated that strain H 16 has the potential to utilize glycerol for indeed suboptimal growth but with an unrestricted capability of valuable PHB production. Although glycerol transport and utilization is independent of the PEP-PTS in strain H 16, deletion of the PTS homologous genes affected anyhow carbon and PHB metabolism in this strain indicating a complex regulatory function of the PTS. However, the slow growth of the wild type on this cheap and abundant sugar substitute prevents it currently from its use in industrial large-scale productions. Heterotrophic growth on glycerol is related to carbon and energy limiting conditions. Besides oxidative stress proteins and hydrogenases, enzymes of gluconeogenesis and the CBB pathway as well as PhaA and PhaB belong to the most abundant proteins of glycerol-grown cells (Friedrich et al. 1981; Schwartz et al. 2009).|$|E
30|$|The {{major step}} of the {{separation}} process is the extraction of PHA granules (Jacquel et al. [2008]). Extraction using solvents such as chloroform, methylene chloride, propylene carbonate and dichloroethane resulted in very pure PHA (Ramsay et al. [1994]). This extraction method required large quantities of toxic and volatile solvent, which not only increased the total production cost but also had adverse environmental consequences ([Choi and Lee 1997]). During digestion of non-PHA cellular materials using hypochlorite, severe degradation of PHA was observed. An enzymatic digestion method developed by Zeneca {{was used for the}} production of <b>Biopol</b> (PHBV) but the use of expensive chemicals and complex processes {{did not seem to be}} economical ([Holmes and Lim 1990]). The extraction {{step of the}} described procedure consumed no energy and lesser quantities of chemicals compared to other recovery methods such as solvent and supercritical fluid extraction, digestion by sodium hypochlorite and enzymes as well as mechanical disruption of cell walls by high-pressure homogenization and ultrasonication (Jacquel et al. [2008]). As the PHA granules themselves do not contain much contaminant (Steinbüchel et al. [1995]), highly pure PHA can be produced by processes that break the cell and solubilize cellular material other than PHA. Therefore, a simple digestion method by inexpensive chemicals seems to be the most efficient and economical recovery process. Subsequent purification steps were essential to obtain a high-purity product. Surfactant pre-treatment and hypochlorite digestion under optimized conditions resulted in a very pure PHB with less degradation (Choi and Lee, [1999]) and was applied for post-extraction purification in the present study.|$|E

The need to provide more goods using renewable resources, combined with advances in science and technology, has provided a receptive environment for biorefi nery systems development. Biorefi neries offer the promise of using fewer non-renewable resources, reducing CO 2 emissions, creating new employment, and spurring innovation using clean and effi cient technologies. Lessons are being learned from the establishment of fi rst-generation biofuel operations. The factors that are key to answering the question of biorefi nery sustainability include: the type of feedstock, the conversion technologies and their respective conversion and energy effi ciencies, the types of products (including coproducts) that are manufactured, and what products are substituted by the bioproducts. The <b>BIOPOL</b> review of eight existing biorefi neries indicates that new effi cient biorefi neries can revitalize existing industries and promote regional development, especially in the R&D area.

40|$|Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), {{of which}} {{polyhydroxybutyrate}} (PHB) {{is the most}} abundant, are bacterial carbon and energy reserve materials of widespread occurrence. They are composed of 3 -hydroxyacid monomer units and exist as {{a small number of}} cytoplasmic granules per cell. The properties of the C 4 homopolymer PHB as a biodegradable thermoplastic first attracted industrial attention more than 20 years ago. Copolymers of C 4 (3 -hydroxybutyrate [3 HB]) and C 5 (3 -hydroxyvalerate [3 HV]) monomer units have modified physical properties; e. g., the plastic is less brittle than PHB, whereas PHAs containing C 8 to C 12 monomers behave as elastomers. This family of materials is the centre of considerable commercial interest, and 3 HB-co- 3 HV copolymers have been marketed by ICI plc as <b>Biopol.</b> The known polymers exist as 2 (1) helices with the fiber repeat decreasing from 0. 596 nm for PHB to about 0. 45 nm for C 8 to C 10 polymers. Novel copolymers with a backbone of 3 HB and 4 HB have been obtained. The native granules contain noncrystalline polymer, and water may possibly act as a plasticizer. Although the biosynthesis and regulation of PHB are generally well understood, the corresponding information for the synthesis of long-side-chain PHAs from alkanes, alcohols, and organic acids is still incomplete. The precise mechanisms of action of the polymerizing and depolymerizing enzymes also remain to be established. The structural genes for the three key enzymes of PHB synthesis from acetyl coenzyme A in Alcaligenes eutrophus have been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. Polymer molecular weights appear to be species specific. The factors influencing the commercial choice of organism, substrate, and isolation process are discussed.

40|$|Fucan is a {{term used}} to denominate a family of sulfated L-fucose-rich polysaccharides. the brown alga Spatoglossum schroederi(Dictyotaceae) has three heterofucans namely fucan A, B and C. the 21 kDa fucan A is {{composed}} of a core of a beta (1 - 3) glucuronic acid-containing oligosaccharide of 4. 5 kDa with branches at C 4 of the fucose chains a (1 - 3) linked. the fucose is mostly substituted at C 4 with a sulfate group and at C 2 with chains of beta (1 - 4) xylose. This fucan has neither anticoagulant (from from 0. 1 to 100 mu g) nor hemorrhagic activities (from 50 to 800 mu g/mL). the antithrombotic test in vivo showed that fucan A has no activity {{in any of the}} concentrations (from 0. 2 to 20 mu g/g/day) tested 1 h after polysaccharide administration. However, when fucan A was injected endovenously 24 h before the ligature of the venae cavae, we observed a dose-dependent effect, reaching saturation at around 20 mu g/g of rat weight. in addition, this effect is also time-dependent, reaching saturation around 16 h after fucan administration. in addition, regardless of the administration route, fucan A displayed antithrombotic activity. the exception was the oral pathway. of particular importance was the finding that fucan A stimulates the synthesis of an antithrombotic heparan sulfate from endothelial cells like heparin. the hypothesis has been raised that the in vivo antithrombotic activity of fucan A is related to the increased production of this heparan. Taken together {{with the fact that the}} compound is practically devoid of anticoagulant and hemorrhagic activity, the data suggest that it may be an ideal antithrombotic agent in vivo.

40|$|Presentado como póster a <b>BIOPOL</b> - 2007 1 st International Conference on Biodegradable Polymers and Sustainable Composites, Alicante, October 3 - 5, 2007. Polypropylene is,with PVC and polyethylene, one of {{the most}} {{employed}} polymers for the production of daily life items. Although it is a thermoplastic polymer and nowadays the recycling conscience of the society is increasing, it is still found in urban wastes and therefore in landfills. Then, the main disadvantage is the permanence and the long life time of this type of plastics. The addition of biodegradable polymers has been claimed as a way to palliate this problem, since with degradation of the biodegradable fraction, the whole plastic object could collapse and practically be converted in a compostable stuff. For example, in the report published by NOLAN-ITU Pty Ltd on October 2002, there is a full revision about biodegradable polymers. It is worth mentioning starch based polymers as well as biodegradable polyesters. In the biodegradable polyesters family, it is possible to find polyhydroxyalkanoates, which are produced naturally by different kind of bacteria. The most common polyhydroxyalkaonates are based on poly 3 -hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and its copolymers with 3 -hydroxy-n-valeric acid (PHBV). Concentrations reported in bibliography for PHB with oxidized polypropylene lie up to 10 %, higher PHB concentrations may involve an adverse effect on mechanical properties of such blends, although the highest PHB concentrations, the most biodegradable blend is obtained. In the case of more polar polymers, as PVC, higher PHB concentrations (up to 70 %) have been reported. Thus, miscibility of polyhydroxyalcanoates and its effect on mechanical properties is {{one of the}} factors to have in mind. On the other hand, SEBS copolymers have also been used as a impact modifier for polypropylene, while in some other cases, they have been used as compatibilizers between polymers of different polarities. The aim of the present work has been the study of the properties of ternary blends PP-PHB-SEBS, where polypropylene is the major component.

40|$|The fast {{growth of}} the oil price is {{increasingly}} seen as a structural element rather than a short-term phenomenon. Expanding oil supply {{is becoming more and}} more problematic and, even assuming the availability of new resources, their exploitation requires massive investments. On the other side, oil demand is significantly growing in countries like China and India. Given their size and their current level of consumption and economic activity, such countries could easily sustain oil demand for a long future. A pressure is exerted on both on the supply and on the demand side and, therefore, on oil price. The HOP! research project has been co-funded by the European Commission DG Research to provide quantitative and qualitative analysis of direct and indirect impacts on the European economy of long term oil price escalation. The study has been undertaken by three partners, with TRT Trasporti e Territorio (Italy) taking the lead and collaborating with Fraunhofer Institute Systems and Innovation research (Germany) and the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies of the European Commission Joint Research Centre (Spain). Impacts of high oil prices can be separated into direct effects on the energy system and the transport system as well as indirect effects on the overall economic system. Of course, changes taking place in one system also affect the other systems. For instance, if alternative transport fuels enter the market to a large extent, the composition of the vehicle fleet and the transport costs of different transport modes will be affected. As a consequence, the increase of transport costs has an impact on the production costs and, hence, on GDP. Changes in GDP, investments and trade volumes would then change energy and transport demand. Given the numerous direct and indirect impacts of high oil prices and their linkages, the final result of an oil price peak can hardly be predicted on a qualitative basis and is likely to change over time. For this reason, in HOP! an analytical toolbox consisting of the two interconnected models ¿ POLES (in an adapted version for the HOP! project including the Biofuels model <b>BioPOL)</b> and ASTRA ¿ is applied to simulate the effects of various scenarios assuming high oil prices, taking into account various feedback loops and the dynamics of impacts.

40|$|The brown alga Spatoglossum schroederi {{contains}} three {{fractions of}} sulfated polysaccharides. One {{of them was}} purified by acetone fractionation, ion exchange, and molecular sieving chromatography. It has a molecular size of 21. 5 kDa and contains fucose, xylose, galactose, and sulfate in a molar ratio of 1. 0 : 0. 5 : 2. 0 : 2. 0 and contains trace amounts of glucuronic acid. Chemical analyses, methylation studies, and NMR spectroscopy showed that the polysaccharide has a unique structure, composed of a central core formed mainly by 4 -linked beta-galactose units, partially sulfated at the 3 -O position. Approximately 25 % of these units contain branches of oligosaccharides (mostly tetrasaccharides) composed of 3 -sulfated, 4 -linked alpha-fucose {{and one or two}} nonsulfated, 4 -linked beta-xylose units at the reducing and nonreducing end, respectively. This sulfated galacto-fucan showed no anticoagulant activity on several in vitro assays. Nevertheless, it had a potent antithrombotic activity on an animal model of experimental venous thrombosis. This effect is time-dependent, reaching the maximum 8 h after its administration compared with the more transient action of heparin. the effect was not observed with the desulfated molecule. Furthermore, the sulfated galactofucan was 2 -fold more potent than heparin in stimulating the synthesis of an antithrombotic heparan sulfate by endothelial cells. Again, this action was also abolished by desulfation of the polysaccharide. Because this sulfated galactofucan has no anticoagulant activity but strongly stimulates the synthesis of heparan sulfate by endothelial cells, we suggested that this last effect {{may be related to the}} in vivo antithrombotic activity of this polysaccharide. in this case the highly sulfated heparan sulfate produced by the endothelial cells is in fact the antithrombotic agent. Our results suggested that this sulfated galactofucan may have a potential application as an antithrombotic drug.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for the {{development}} of new antibiotics to overcome the ever growing number of drug-resistant bacteria. [1] In 2007 a previously unknown antibacterial peptide was discovered, namely Septocylindrin B, which was obtained from a terrestrial isolate of the fungus Septocylindrum sp. [2]. It belongs to the family of the peptaibols and closely relates to alamethicin, one of the most extensively studied among the peptaibols, a large class of peptides with three characteristic features: a high alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) residue content, an acetylated N-terminus and a terminal alcohol function as C-terminus. [3] Recent studies have shown that septocylindrin B exhibits a significant antibacterial and antifungal activity. It has a terminal Phaol-residue [2 -{[(2 S) - 2 -amino- 3 -phenylpropyl]amino} ethanol], which contains a secondary amine and a primary alcohol function. The main goal of this thesis was the synthesis of the peptaibol Septocylindrin B and several analogues. The latter differ from the original peptide only in their last amino acid derivative: Phaol. The first objective was to synthesize the orthogonally protected Phaol in large amounts. In chapter two, a reproducible large scale synthesis of Phaol is described. Two synthetic routes were examined, but only one was able to provide an easily purifiable Phaol moiety. After the optimisation of this synthesis, several analogues were synthesized. All these amino acid derivatives were orthogonally protected after which they were incorporated into the peptide chain, which gave rise to Septocylindrin B and several of its analogues. The obtained peptides were tested for their ability to permeate artificial lipid membranes, using a fluorescent-dye leakage assay. Their antibacterial and antifungal properties were also investigated. In this way, the role of the N-terminal residue could be investigated. The conformational analysis indicates that the peptide folds in a right-handed alpha-helix. Comparison with a reference, [Glu(OMe) 7, 18, 19] Alamethicin F 50, confirmed these conclusions. The leakage assays, to investigate the ability of the peptides to permeate artificial membranes, indicate that the synthesized peptides have this capability to permeate a bilayer. The protected analogues are less potent to do so than the unprotected peptides. The results of the antibacterial and antifungal tests show no improved bioactivity of any of the synthesized analogues, in comparison to the published bioactivity of Septocylindrin B. Some peptides showed good antibacterial activity. The results of the antibacterial tests indicate that the primary alcohol function and the secondary amine are necessary for the bioactivity, seeing as none of the protected analogues were active. The necessity of the alcohol function is also proven. This in contrast with the necessity of reduced amide function in the Phaol residue. [1] Raja, A.; LaBonte, J.; Lebbos, J.; Kirkpatrick, P.

40|$|Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are polyesters {{produced}} and stored intracellularly as reserve materials for carbon and energy {{by a wide}} range of prokaryotic microorganisms under imbalanced nutritional conditions. PHA production by pure culture has been extensively studied, enabling high production yields and a variety of polymer characteristics. Poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate (3 HB) -co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate (3 HV) (PHBV) has been commercially available under the trade name <b>Biopol.</b> However, the high production costs of these biopolymers are a major barrier for their widespread acceptance as substitute for traditional non-biodegradable polymers. The main costs are associated with maintaining the sterile conditions required by pure cultures, the use of expensive feed materials (eg. sugars) and also the polymer extraction process. Producing PHAs using mixed cultures (such as activated sludge) can drastically simplify the production process and significantly reduce the feed costs due to the use of cheap substrates. It also has the additional benefits in reusing waste materials. To date, substantial efforts have been put into improving PHA productivity in mixed cultures, with the characteristics of these bio-polyesters largely unexplored. The main product is typically PHB, which has several inherent deficiencies in properties. These include brittleness due to its high crystallinity, and thermal instability near its melting point of 175 - 180 °C. To overcome the drawbacks of PHB, non- 3 HB monomer units are incorporated in the bio-polymerisation process, but this generally requires the addition of specific and often complex precursor substrates. Glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) are emerging as an attractive alternative to other heterotrophic PHA producers due to their special metabolism. GAOs were initially identified as competitors to the polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) in alternating anaerobic/aerobic wastewater treatment systems. Under anaerobic conditions, GAOs generate energy and reducing power from glycogen hydrolysis, which are used for taking up carbon sources (eg. acetate or propionate) and their synthesis into PHAs as intracellular storage products. Under aerobic conditions, the stored PHAs is partly oxidised for energy generation with the remainder used for biomass growth and glycogen replenishment. The anaerobic hydrolysis of glycogen yields both acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA which can be condensed to form 3 -hydroxybutyryl-CoA and 3 -hydroxyvaleryl-CoA, the precursors of 3 HB and 3 HV. Therefore GAOs are capable of producing multiple 3 - hydroxyalkanoate (3 HA) monomers even when only a single carbon source (eg., acetate) is supplied. The potential of producing copolymers without addition of particular monomer-relevant carbon sources provides GAOs an advantage over other mixed culture heterotrophs in terms of polymer quality. So far, two main bacterial species have been identified to display the GAO phenotype, namely, Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis (henceforth referred to as Competibacter) and Defluviicoccus vanus-related GAOs belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria phylum (henceforth referred to as DvGAOs). This thesis focuses on the PHA production by GAOs. The capability of GAOs to produce heterogeneous PHAs from a single carbon source is investigated by characterising the PHA products and optimising the polymer productivity. Moreover, DvGAOs are comprehensively studied for their ability to yield novel four-monomer copolymers of 3 HB, 3 HV, 3 -hydroxy- 2 -methylvalerate (3 HMV) and 3 -hydroxy- 3 - methylbutyrate (3 HMB) with controllable composition and favourable physical properties. The main contributions from this thesis are summarised below. The polymers consisting of 3 HB, 3 HV and minor amounts of 3 HMV and 3 HMB, produced by Competibacter-dominated GAOs using acetate as a sole carbon source, were identified to be true copolymers based on a detailed characterisation using &sup 1 H and ¹&sup 3 C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The monomer sequence distribution analysis using a known polymer characterisation model suggests that these polyesters are mixtures of random copolymers and thus likely possess desirable properties for practical use, which was confirmed experimentally. This demonstrates that GAOs have a true potential for producing high-quality polymers from a simple and cheap carbon source. The PHAs produced by GAOs under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were characterized using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The acetate-derived copolymers possessed characteristics similar to those of commercially available PHBV products. The anaerobically produced PHA contained a relatively constant proportion of non- 3 HB monomers (30 ± 5 C-mol%), irrespective of the amount of acetate assimilated. In contrast, under aerobic conditions, GAOs only produced 3 HB monomers from acetate causing a gradually decreasing 3 HV fraction. The 3 HV fraction thus obtained ranged from 7 to 35 C-mol%, depending on the amount of acetate supplied under aerobic conditions. The PHAs produced under solely anaerobic conditions featured lower melting points and crystallinity, higher molecular weights, and narrower molecular weight distributions compared to the aerobically produced polymers. However, the anaerobic production yield was limited at 28 % of dry cell weight (DCW) due to the shortage of glycogen, while aerobic production obtained a maximum polymer content of 41 % based on DCW. To increase the PHA yield from anaerobic production, a novel three-stage strategy was developed. It was demonstrated to be an effective approach to optimise both {{the quantity and quality of}} the copolymers produced by GAOs. Using the Competibacterdominated GAO culture, up to 48 wt% poly(3 HB-co- 3 HV-co- 3 HMV) based on DCW was achieved from acetate as the sole carbon source, close to the highest copolymer yield reported to date produced by mixed cultures but using specific precursor substrates. The optimisation method comprised of an aerobic famine, an aerobic feast, and an anaerobic feast period. The glycogen storage was enhanced through the initial two aerobic periods and hence increased the energy and reducing power available for the final anaerobic polymer synthesis step. The terpolymers/copolymers thus produced displayed high molecular weights (380 - 460 kg/mol) with a narrow distribution range. A feeding strategy based on pH-stat was demonstrated to achieve the automatic control of feed addition. Using a highly enriched DvGAO mixed culture (95 ± 3 %) copolymers of 3 HB, 3 HV, 3 HMV and 3 HMB with controllable monomer fractions were obtained from acetate and propionate substrates. Through manipulating the ratio of acetate and propionate in the medium, the 3 HB and 3 HMV monomer portions could be varied extensively (10 to 66 mol% 3 HB and 2 to 41 mol% 3 HMV). The microstructure study revealed that the PHAs produced were likely random copolymers or mixtures of random copolymers. These PHA products were demonstrated to possess favourable properties. The weight-average molecular weights were in the range 390 - 560 kg/mol, while the DSC traces showed melting temperatures in the range of 70 to 161 °C, glass transition temperatures between - 8 and 0 °C, and melting enthalpies (ΔHm) between 9. 1 and 31. 5 J/g. The incorporation of considerable amounts of 3 HMV and 3 HMB constituents greatly lowered the crystallinity, potentially providing the ductile and tough materials required for many practical applications. The anaerobic metabolism of DvGAOs with acetate and propionate was found to be well described by the metabolic models previously proposed for GAOs and verified with experimental data obtained with other types of GAO cultures. The results suggested DvGAOs likely use metabolic pathways similar to those used by other GAOs for anaerobic acetate and propionate uptake. However, when both acetate and propionate were present simultaneously, DvGAOs took up these two carbon sources sequentially, with propionate uptake preceding acetate uptake. As a result, mixtures of 3 HV& 3 HMV-rich copolymers and 3 HB& 3 HV-rich copolymers were formed. Through model-based analysis, it was hypothesised that DvGAOs prefer propionate in order to maximise their production of PHAs with the same glycogen consumption, which would enhance their growth potential in the following aerobic period. This feature may explain the more efficient PHA production by DvGAOs with propionate as the carbon substrate compared to acetate. Despite very low acetate consumption when propionate was available in excess, the presence of acetate considerably stimulated the uptake of propionate in comparison to the case where only propionate was present. This was likely due to the difference of the intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level in the two cases. A lower intracellular ATP level detected in the simultaneous presence of acetate and propionate might stimulate the glycolysis process resulting in a higher propionate uptake rate. This thesis shows that GAOs have indeed a good potential as cost-effective PHA producers. They are able to efficiently generate true copolymers of up to four 3 HA monomers with desirable properties from simple carbon sources. Through manipulating the feed composition, comonomer fractions can vary in a wide range resulting in a variety of polymer properties. The contribution from this work could be very useful for the current drive to cost-effectively produce good quality PHAs to replace conventional petrol-derived polymers...|$|E
40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} (AC) is an aneural and avascular {{tissue that}} covers the ends of articulating bones in diarthrodial joints, and its main functions are to distribute joint loading and to provide nearly frictionless movement of the articulating bones. The mechanical properties of AC can be attribute to the complex structure of its extracellular matrix (ECM), mainly composed by collagen fibres, proteoglycan (PG) aggregates and interstitial water [1, 2]. Nowadays, the progression of mean expectation of life has highlighted {{the importance of a}} correct diagnosis for many age-related diseases. In AC, aging process occur in older age with cellular senescence [3, 4] and ECM modifications [5, 6], frequently involving in Osteoarthritic diseases [7 – 9]. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease and represent {{one of the most common}} disabilities cause (6, 6 % of Italian population, actually), posing a high economical burden to society. OA is characterized by the proceeding destruction of AC by uncontrolled proteolysis of ECM and typically leads to a remodeling of affected joints. No treatment neither early diagnosis method currently exist for OA pathologies, and the detection of differences and relations between early OA and aging is still an open field in clinical research [3, 8, 10]. To understand the progression of the disease, the comprehension of mechanisms involving on to ECM components during AC degradation is essential. The reduction of PGs concentration is recognized as the first symptom of degeneration in OA [11 – 14], while collagen fibers result more resistant from degradation. Using different experimental techniques, it is possible to observe the contribution of degradation of a specific macromolecule to the AC disease progression. Dielectric Spectroscopy (DS) resulted as an indirect indicator of collagen fibrils integrity through observation of intermolecular hydrogen bounds formation between water molecules [15]. Moreover, some water molecules result oriented along collagen fibers and that orientation is well recognized by Magnetic Resonance T 2 -weighted imaging (T 2 w-MRI) contrast variations through intra-molecular dipole interactions of water hydrogen nuclei[16 - 18]. The study of the dynamic of water molecules in cartilage resulted to provide information on cartilage structure [19 - 21]. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) [22 - 26] is a widely used Magnetic Resonance technique to investigate fiber microstructures in human brain, like in skeletal muscle tissue [27]. Moreover, some authors [20, 28, 29] have demonstrated that DTI technique can recognise collagen fibril orientation and other authors [20, 30, 31] have shown how the reduction of proteoglycan content in cartilage affect water Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC). For all the cartilage futures listed so far, and taking into account the potentiality provided by DTI investigations, here we monitored cartilage aging by means of DTI and T 2 -weighted imaging techniques. Specifically, starting to the observation that in cartilage is generally observed a reduction in water content during aging [32], we investigate in vitro cartilage samples during natural dehydration process. Moreover, we combined NMR with DS measurements to deeply investigate structural variation in cartilage matrix. [1] Zernia, G. 2006. Collagen dynamics in articular cartilage under osmotic pressure.
