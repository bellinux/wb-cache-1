5|$|The black <b>bean</b> <b>aphid</b> {{is a major}} pest {{of sugar}} beet, bean and celery crops {{with large numbers of}} aphids cause {{stunting}} of the plants. Beans suffer damage to flowers and pods which may not develop properly. Early-sown crops may avoid significant damage if they have already flowered before the number of aphids builds up in the spring. Celery can be heavily infested. The plants are stunted by the removal of sap, the stems are distorted, harmful viruses are transmitted, and aphid residues may contaminate the crop.|$|E
5|$|The black <b>bean</b> <b>aphid</b> {{may have}} {{originated}} in Europe and Asia {{but it is}} now one of the most widely distributed species of aphids.

In the warmer parts of its range, apterous individuals can survive the winter and they may continue to reproduce asexually all year round.|$|E
5|$|The black <b>bean</b> <b>aphid</b> (Aphis fabae) is a {{small black}} insect in the Aphis genus, with a broad, soft body, {{a member of the}} order Hemiptera. Other common names include blackfly, <b>bean</b> <b>aphid</b> and beet leaf aphid. In the warmer months of the year it is found in large numbers on the undersides of leaves and on the growing tips of host plants, {{including}} various agricultural crops and many wild and ornamental plants. Both winged and wingless forms exist and at this time of year, they are all females. They suck sap from stems and leaves and cause distortion of the shoots, stunted plants, reduced yield and spoiled crops. This aphid also acts as a vector for viruses that cause plant disease and the honeydew it secretes may encourage the growth of sooty mould. It breeds profusely by live birth but its numbers are kept in check, especially in the later part of the summer, by various predatory and parasitic insects. Ants feed on the honeydew it produces and take active steps to remove the aphid's enemies. It is a widely distributed pest of agricultural crops and can be controlled by chemical or biological means. In the autumn, winged forms move to different host plants where both males and females are produced. These mate and the females lay eggs which overwinter.|$|E

5|$|The black <b>bean</b> <b>aphid</b> {{has both}} sexual and asexual generations in its life cycle. It also {{alternates}} hosts {{at different times}} of year. The primary host plants are woody shrubs, and eggs are laid on these by winged females in the autumn. The adults then die and the eggs overwinter. The aphids that hatch from these eggs in the spring are wingless females known as stem mothers. These are able to reproduce asexually, giving birth to live offspring, nymphs, through parthenogenesis. The lifespan of a parthenogenetic female is about 50 days and during this period, each can produce as many as 30 young. The offspring are also females and able to reproduce without mating, but further generations are usually winged forms. These migrate to their secondary host plants, completely different species that are typically herbaceous plants with soft, young growth.|$|E
5|$|The black <b>bean</b> <b>aphid</b> is a small, soft-bodied insect {{that has}} {{specialised}} {{piercing and sucking}} mouthparts which are used to suck the juice from plants. This aphid is usually seen in large numbers and is a tiny, plump insect about two millimetres long with a small head and bulbous abdomen. The body is blackish or dark green in colour. Many adults are devoid of wings, a state known as aptery. Winged forms, known as alates, are longer and more slender than aptates and have shiny black heads and thoraxes. The membranous wings of the alates are held angled over the body. The antennae are less {{than two-thirds of the}} length of the body and both they and the legs are pale yellow in colour with black tips. The tibiae of the hind legs are swollen in egg-laying females. Near the rear of the abdomen are a pair of slender, elongated tubes known as cornicles or siphunculi. Their function is the production of a defensive waxy secretion. They are twice as long as the finger-like tail and both are brownish-black.|$|E

40|$|Many animal paths have an {{intricate}} statistical pattern that manifests {{itself as a}} power law-like tail {{in the distribution of}} movement lengths. Such distributions occur if individuals move according to a L??vy flight (a mode of dispersal in which the distance moved follows a power law), or if there is variation between individuals such that some individuals move much farther than others. Distinguishing between these two mechanisms requires large quantities of data, which are not available for most species studied. Here, we analyze paths of black <b>bean</b> <b>aphids</b> (Aphis fabae Scopoli) and show that individual animals move in a predominantly diffusive manner, but that, because of variation at population level, they collectively appear to display superdiffusive characteristics, often interpreted as being characteristic for a L??vy flight...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDefences against parasites are {{typically}} associated with costs to the host {{that contribute to the}} maintenance of variation in resistance. This also applies to the defence provided by the facultative bacterial endosymbiont Hamiltonella defensa, which protects its aphid hosts against parasitoid wasps while imposing life-history costs. To investigate the cost-benefit relationship within protected hosts, we introduced multiple isolates of H. defensa to the same genetic backgrounds of black <b>bean</b> <b>aphids,</b> Aphis fabae, and we quantified the protection against their parasitoid Lysiphlebus fabarum as well as the costs to the host (reduced lifespan and reproduction) in the absence of parasitoids. Surprisingly, we observed the opposite of a trade-off. Strongly protective isolates of H. defensa reduced lifespan and lifetime reproduction of unparasitized aphids to a lesser extent than weakly protective isolates. This finding has important implications for the evolution of defensive symbiosis and highlights the need for {{a better understanding of how}} strain variation in protective symbionts is maintained...|$|R

All the treatments were replicated four times. Results indicated that both treatments gave significant difference in mean number of aphids compared to control, however, lmidacloprid (Confidor 200 SL) was found as the most effective in controlling aphids with low number of aphids compared with other treatments.

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{accidental}} introduction, the invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, has successfully invaded {{many parts of the}} world including the California coast. Argentine ants are extraordinarily effective in displacing native ants. This study aims to link animal behavior and growth to resource consumption. We examined how different diets affect Argentine ant behavior. We hypothesized that having a diet composed of both carbohydrate and protein may increase colony size and activity level rather than having a diet composed of only nitrogen-based protein. To test this hypothesis, we first conducted a greenhouse experiment in which we used the presence or absence of honeydew-producing black <b>bean</b> <b>aphids,</b> Aphis fabae, to manipulate carbohydrate resources given to the ants. Our results show that carbohydrate- based honeydew gave ant colonies a higher number of surviving workers and a lower trophic level. We then conducted a lab experiment in which we tested activity and growth potential of Argentine ants from different supercolonies and manipulated their access of carbohydrate. The results showed that having sugar in the diet increased colony activity, individual level aggression, and likelihood for worker survival, and greater colony growth. These results aid our understanding to the nutritional ecology of Argentine ants, and possibly related species of Hymenoptera...|$|R

If AM fungi affect plant volatiles only via increased P acquisition, we predicted that the emission of volatiles and the attractiveness of mycorrhizal <b>beans</b> to <b>aphids</b> {{would be similar to}} those of non-mycorrhizal beans supplied with additional P.

The attractiveness of plants to pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris) was positively affected by AM fungi and correlated with the extent of root colonization; however, attractiveness was neither affected by P treatment nor correlated with leaf P concentration. These findings suggest that increased P uptake is not the main mechanism by which mycorrhiza increase the attractiveness of plants to aphids.
