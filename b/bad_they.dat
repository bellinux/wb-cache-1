5|$|Pepper Rodgers {{was hired}} soon after Fulcher quit. Rodgers was hired {{away from the}} UCLA Bruins and like Carson and Fulcher, simply could not return Tech to its {{national}} prominence of Dodd's era, and after six seasons, Rodgers had accumulated only 34 wins and barely a 50% winning percentage. Rodgers flamboyant demeanor shortened his welcome at the school, and Athletic Director Doug Weaver, replaced him with Bill Curry. Homer Rice became Athletic Director, and attempted to reinvigorate Tech's program by joining the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1980. The Georgia Tech football program reached its lowest point in modern history after the hiring of Bill Curry, who had no experience as a head coach, but was a refreshing change after the flamboyant Rodgers. Curry's first two Tech teams from 1980–1981 went 2-19-1 with the only bright spots being a brilliant 24-21 victory over Bear Bryant's Alabama team at Legion Field to open the 1981 season and a 3-3 slug fest in 1980 with then No.1 rated Notre Dame at Grant Field. Things had gotten so <b>bad,</b> <b>they</b> could only get better. He slowly rebuilt the team, restored a winning mentality to the Georgia Tech fan base, and in 1985 Tech won 9 games, including a 17-14 victory over Michigan State in the All American Bowl.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the film}} is of course fictional and Hertzfeldt has never done {{advertising}} work, he received many offers to do television commercials after Billy's Balloon drew international attention. In appearances Hertzfeldt has often told the humorous story of how he was tempted to produce the worst possible cartoons he {{could come up with}} for the companies, make off with their money, and see if they would actually make it to air. Eventually this became the germ for Rejecteds theme of a collection of cartoons so <b>bad</b> <b>they</b> were rejected by advertising agencies, leading to their creator's breakdown and ultimately the cartoons' metaphysical crisis.|$|E

25|$|In X-Men: Days of Future Past, the time-displaced Wolverine {{encourages}} the young Charles Xavier to later recruit Jean Grey {{for the future}} team, along with Ororo Munroe and Scott Summers, arguing that the good they accomplished outweighs the <b>bad</b> <b>they</b> experienced. Commentary in the film confirms that the young red-haired girl's identity in the field who was marveling at Magneto levitating the Robert F. Kennedy stadium was in fact Jean Grey as a young child. When the timeline resets, Logan is astonished to discover that Jean and Cyclops are {{alive and well in}} the new timeline, suggesting that the events of the original X-Men films played out very differently.|$|E
25|$|These {{examples}} show that, in {{the absence}} of effective legal tender laws, Gresham's Law works in reverse. If given the choice of what money to accept, people will transact with money they believe to be of highest long-term value. However, if not given the choice, and required to accept all money, good and <b>bad,</b> <b>they</b> will tend to keep the money of greater perceived value in their possession, and pass on the bad money to someone else. In short, {{in the absence}} of legal tender laws, the seller will not accept anything but money of certain value (good money), while the existence of legal tender laws will cause the buyer to offer only money with the lowest commodity value (bad money) as the creditor must accept such money at face value.|$|E
25|$|A {{whiteboard}} grid {{is used to}} plan episodes a {{few weeks}} in advance, based on release schedules, events like E3, interviews, and other segments. They try to time reviews so they occur before or in the week the game is released, however, being a television show with a longer production period than most online content, {{this is not always}} possible. One challenge is having publishers provide games early enough to be reviewed and filmed in time. Often they receive debug code which can only be played on debug consoles, and developers are usually still working out kinks, so will provide a list of bugs for the team to take into account. Good Game also have to be wary of embargo dates as reviews can't be broadcast before then. Even if the embargo ends a few hours after a Good game episode, the review must be held back for a week. Sometimes, Good Game can only get a copy of the game after it is released, and Bajo points out that while this is sometimes due to random factors it can also be a sign that the game is <b>bad.</b> <b>They</b> try to avoid having too many of the same type of game in each week, and try to include games on all consoles. They hope that all this will ensure there is something for everyone.|$|E

500|$|Co-creators and {{executive}} producers Damon Lindelof and J.J. Abrams wrote the premiere's teleplay {{based upon a}} story by Lindelof. The episode was Abrams' first Lost writing credit since the pilot. They laid out the third season {{with the idea of}} [...] "us versus them"; Carlton Cuse, a showrunner, explained, [...] "And who is us? And who is them? I mean I think we all tend to objectify people who we don't know much about and I think that's the audience's view of The Others right now -- they are <b>bad,</b> <b>they</b> are the malevolent force on the island. But {{over the course of the}} stories we're going to be telling this season on the show we expect the audience's view of The Others to change a lot." ...|$|E
500|$|This was {{the first}} episode to air which was {{executive}} produced by Mike Scully. Sam Simon pitched an episode {{for one of the}} first seasons which saw Homer getting a gun and nobody wanting him to have it. The episode concluded with Homer foiling a robbery and stating that although guns bring destruction, it worked for him. However, this episode was pitched by Scully for either season seven or eight, before being used for season nine. This provided the basic outline, and John Swartzwelder wrote the script. A lot of lines in the episode put guns in a positive light, as the staff felt that they could not just make an episode about how <b>bad</b> <b>they</b> were. Several of the staff, including Swartzwelder, are [...] "pro gun", although others, such as Matt Groening, are completely against them. The episode was designed to be non-biased and to portray each side of the argument equally. Scully noted that if there is any message in the episode it is that a man like Homer should not own a gun. The censors were nervous about some of the episode's subject matter, such as Homer pointing the gun in Marge's face, and Bart aiming the gun at Milhouse with the apple in his mouth, but ultimately let it go.|$|E

The Doctor and Amy take Vincent in the TARDIS to {{the present and the}} Van Gogh exhibit at the Musée d'Orsay. Vincent is stunned at the display and becomes emotionally {{overwhelmed}} when he overhears art curator Dr. Black (Bill Nighy) say that Van Gogh was [...] "the greatest painter of them all" [...] and [...] "one of the greatest men who ever lived". They return an emotionally changed Vincent to the past and say their final goodbyes. As the Doctor and Amy return to the present, Amy is confident that there will be hundreds of new paintings by Vincent waiting for them, though the Doctor is less certain. The former is crushed to learn that Vincent still committed suicide weeks after their adventure, at the age of 37. The Doctor explains that life is a mixture of bad and good, and while their brief encounter with Vincent couldn't undo all of the <b>bad,</b> <b>they</b> added some good to his life. The evidence is in Vincent's displayed works: the face no longer appears in The Church, and now Vase with 12 Sunflowers bears the inscription, [...] "For Amy".|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{received}} some criticism. Dan Compora of Airlock Alpha {{said after a}} run of [...] "several strong" [...] episodes, Lost [...] "has slipped into mediocrity. While none of the recent episodes have been <b>bad,</b> <b>they</b> haven't been anything special. For a hundredth episode, average simply isn't good enough. While the shooting of Daniel at the end was stunning, I expected something much more {{from the rest of}} the episode than learning the identity of Daniel's parents." [...] A reviewer for TVoholic.com thought the episode was good, though not as good as [...] "The Constant", and he thought [...] "it came with lots of answers and references to past episodes from this season and the ones before it, making it all the more exciting." [...] The reviewer would, however, have [...] "loved any sort of explanation as to why [...] changed his mind about changing the past or how he thought this could work. There must have been something that made Daniel think this was possible, but he was in such a rush that he never took care to explain." [...] Jon Lachonis of TVOvermind said that as an internal character piece, [...] "The Variable" [...] was not [...] "so much a great ending for Daniel. We brushed up against many key events and people – Theresa, Daniel’s ‘nurse’, and the Widmore and Eloise parental connection, etc. – but these forays into the geniuses’ past events were more to thread Daniel through the plot than to establish their connection to who Daniel truly was." ...|$|E

[...] The longshoremen had to pay for their jobs on the dock; the seafarers were little more than slaves on the ships.

[...] They were willing to strike because their conditions were so <b>bad,</b> <b>they</b> had almost nothing to lose.|$|E

He drew Giant-Size Avengers #4 which featured the wedding of the Vision and the Scarlet Witch. Writer Tony Isabella and Heck launched the new superhero team book The Champions in October 1975. But in 1977, he began working almost exclusively for DC. Heck explained in 1985, [...] "I left Marvel for a change of pace. I kept getting all the new inkers. Everyone who walked in, I got them.

2500|$|Among the {{negative}} reviews, Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert wrote: [...] "Tommy Boy {{is one of}} those movies that plays like an explosion down at the screenplay factory. You can almost picture a bewildered office boy, his face smudged with soot, wandering through the ruins and rescuing pages at random. Too <b>bad</b> <b>they</b> didn't mail them to the insurance company instead of filming them." [...] The film is on Ebert's [...] "Most Hated" [...] list. Caryn James of The New York Times wrote that the film was [...] "the very poor cousin of a dopey Jim Carrey movie". Owen Gleiberman graded the film a [...] "C" [...] on an A+ to F scale, and Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress said that it was [...] "nothing great."

Explaining how this apparent contradiction is resolved, Maimonides said that just as God desired that fire rises upward and water descends downward, so too, God desired that people have free choice and be responsible for their deeds, without being pulled or forced. Rather, people, on their own initiative, with the knowledge that God granted them, do anything that people are able to do. Therefore, people are judged according to their deeds. If they do good, they are treated with beneficence. If they do <b>bad,</b> <b>they</b> are treated harshly. This is implied by the prophets.|$|E
