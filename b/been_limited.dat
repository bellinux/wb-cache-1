5|$|Bicycle kicks {{can be used}} defensively {{to clear}} away the ball from the goalmouth or offensively to strike at the opponent's goal {{in an attempt to}} score. The bicycle kick is an {{advanced}} football skill that is dangerous for inexperienced players. Its successful performance has <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> largely to the most experienced and athletic players in football history.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{appear to}} moult {{once a year}} in spring or summer, {{although}} observations have <b>been</b> <b>limited.</b> Young birds spend about a year in juvenile plumage before moulting into adult plumage at around a year old. Juvenile birds have more brown-tinged and uniform plumage; the darker colour around the lores and eyes are less distinct. Their blackish bill is yellow-tipped, and the gape is yellow. Their eyes are brownish, but turn yellow early. The exact timing is unknown but likely to be around four months of age.|$|E
5|$|Cyprus {{appears to}} be the {{principal}} intermediary station between Mycenaean Greece and the Middle East, based on the considerable greater quantities of Mycenaean goods found there. On the other hand, trade with the Hittite lands in central Anatolia appears to have <b>been</b> <b>limited.</b> Trade with Troy is also well attested, while Mycenaean trade routes expanded further to the Bosphorus and the shores of the Black Sea. Mycenaean swords have been found as far away as Georgia in the eastern Black Sea coast.|$|E

5|$|Expansion {{during the}} war had <b>been</b> <b>limited,</b> with the RAN growing to include thirty-seven ships and more than 5,000 {{personnel}} by 1918. The RAN's losses had also been modest, only losing the two submarines AE1 and AE2, whilst casualties included 171 fatalities – 108 Australians and 63 officers and men on loan from the Royal Navy, {{with less than a}} third the result of enemy action.|$|E
5|$|Facility {{reconstruction}} has not <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> to VOA/Camp Ware and Schiefflin/EBK.

There is also a plan to rebuild Camp Todee in Todee District, upper Montserrado. The Barclay Training Center (BTC) was handed back to the Government of Liberia on July 31, 2009 at a ceremony attended by the Minister for National Defense and the United States Ambassador {{after four years of}} management by DynCorp.|$|E
5|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} (FFVs) {{are based}} on dual-fuel systems that supply both fuels into the combustion chamber {{at the same time}} in various calibrated proportions. The most common fuels used by FFVs today are unleaded gasoline and ethanol fuel. Ethanol FFVs can run on pure gasoline, pure ethanol (E100) or any combination of both. Methanol has also been blended with gasoline in flex-fuel vehicles known as M85 FFVs, but their use has <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> mainly to demonstration projects and small government fleets, particularly in California.|$|E

5|$|Fund {{accounting}} is {{an accounting}} system for recording resources whose use has <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> by the donor, grant authority, governing agency, or other individuals or organisations or by law. It emphasizes accountability rather than profitability, {{and is used}} by Nonprofit organizations and by governments. In this method, a fund consists of a self-balancing set of accounts and each are reported as either unrestricted, temporarily restricted or permanently restricted based on the provider-imposed restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} cost-effective, reliable, sustainable, and {{environmentally}} friendly, but has historically <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> to areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded {{the range and}} size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|Governments {{around the}} world are {{considering}} a range of waste management and disposal options, usually involving deep-geologic placement, although there has <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> progress toward implementing long-term waste management solutions. This is partly because the timeframes in question when dealing with radioactive waste range from 10,000 to millions of years, according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses.|$|E

Due to the high cost of getting into space, manned spaceflight has <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> to low Earth orbit and the Moon.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, President Clinton {{signed into}} effect the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which {{included}} the largest {{capital gains tax cut}} in U.S. history. Under the act, the profits on the sale of a personal residence ($500,000 for married couples, $250,000 for singles) were exempted if lived in for at least 2 years over the last 5. (This had previously <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> to a $125,000 once-in-a-lifetime exemption for those over the age of 55.) There were also reductions {{in a number of other}} taxes on investment gains.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, air {{furnaces}} (such as reverberatory furnaces) {{are naturally}} aspirated, usually by the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue. According to this broad definition, bloomeries for iron, blowing houses for tin, and smelt mills for lead would {{be classified as}} blast furnaces. However, the term has usually <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> to those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron, an intermediate material used {{in the production of}} commercial iron and steel, and the shaft furnaces used in combination with sinter plants in base metals smelting.|$|E

5|$|Oslac (fl. 966–975) is {{regarded}} as the first ealdorman (or earl) of York and its dependent territories. These included but may not have <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> to the southern half of Northumbria. His background is obscure because of poor source documentation. The latter has facilitated disagreement amongst historians regarding his family and ethnicity.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} {{appears to}} have arrived in Fiji in 1925 on Ono-i-lau and Vatoa islands. It may have colonised from New Zealand via Raoul in the Kermadec Islands where it is abundant, that group being roughly equidistant between New Zealand and Fiji. Its spread in Fiji has <b>been</b> <b>limited,</b> and there are doubts about the population's viability. Tonga was colonised {{at about the same}} date and the birds there have been slowly spreading north through the group.|$|E

5|$|The odorless and {{tasteless}} thallium sulfate {{was once}} widely used as rat poison and ant killer. Since 1972 this use has been prohibited in the United States due to safety concerns.

This use has <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> due to their narrow therapeutic index, and the development of improved medicines for these conditions.|$|E
