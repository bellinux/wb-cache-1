He also changed the way the UFW approached strikes. In the past, the union would strike but end the walkout once the union had won the organizing election (held under the procedures of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act). Employers would then file numerous appeals to the election, and over the many months (and sometimes years) it took for the appeals to be heard the union's support would vanish. Medina's new strategy {{was to keep the}} workers on strike even after the organizing election was won; this pressured employers to waive their legal right to appeal, recognize the union, and enter collective bargaining neogtiations immediately. If negotiations stalled, Medina's <b>back-up</b> <b>strategy</b> was ask union members to perform their jobs sloppily and then leave work. The employer would institute a lockout, a strike would begin, and the employer would return to the bargaining table to get the harvest in.|$|E

It examines whether laypeople perceive CE to be an acceptable <b>back-up</b> <b>strategy</b> (plan B) if current efforts to mitigate CO 2 emissions were to fail. This idea is a common justification for CE research in the scientific debate and may significantly influence future public debates. Ninety-eight German participants chose their preferred climate policy strategy in a quasi-realistic scenario. Participants could chose between mitigation and three CE techniques as alternative options. We employed a think-aloud interview technique, which allowed us to trace participants ’ informational needs and thought processes. Drawing on Huber’s risk management decision theory, the study addressed whether specific CE options {{are more likely to}} be accepted if they are mentally represented as a <b>back-up</b> <b>strategy.</b> Results support this assumption, especially for cloud whitening. This result is especially relevant considering the high prevalence of the plan B framing in CE appraisal studies and its implications for public opinion-formation processes.

40|$|A three-dimensional, implicit, {{finite element}} {{composites}} damage model is developed, {{and applied to}} a problem involving highly complex, three-dimensional loading, i. e. a single-lap, multi-bolt, composite joint, having variable clearances. The model extends a previous model, adding Puck’s criteria to allow delamination-like, transverse cracking-like or mixed mode failures to be simulated. Plasticity is also added for non-reversible strains in the undamaged parts of the matrix, and a mesh independence strategy is incorporated. A <b>back-up</b> <b>strategy</b> for when the Newton–Raphson method fails to converge, adds significantly to model robustness. The model is implemented in a commercial, implicit solver and demonstrates excellent robustness, being capable of following damage progression from onset, through bearing failure at the holes, to catastrophic, net-tension failure. The predicted failure modes and loads are in good agreement with experiment. The effect of clearance on secondary bending, and consequently on damage progression, is demonstrated. The current model shows better capability than our previous model for predicting matrix damage near the hole, which will be important for future fatigue modelling studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{competitive}} pressure in pharmaceutical industry is reflected by longer development times and increasing development costs yielding less new chemical entities. In particular, identification of suitable lead compounds {{is one of}} the key challenges in early drug discovery. Next to well established techniques like high throughput screening (HTS) and virtual screening computer-aided rescaffolding has become an important approach in detecting novel chemical structures [1, 2]. The development of New Chemical Entities (NCEs) requires the exploration of novel landscapes in chemical space. Rescaffolding is in particular important in lead identification but also in lead optimization. If a lead series cannot be optimized in multidimensional space, scaffold-rescuing is often perceived as <b>back-up</b> <b>strategy</b> to transfer hitherto available SAR into a new scaffold. With a binding site or a pharmacophore in hand often de novo design methods are applied to identify novel chemical matter. However, de novo design differs from rescaffolding in that the goal of the first is primarily to generate new molecules in chemical space while the latter aims to design new scaffolds under constraints: high similarity in the desired property space and novelty in scaffold space. This allows jumping out of the known region of chemical space towards new regions of chemistry resulting in molecules with similar properties and activities but with novel frameworks. This talk will focus on ligand-based rescaffolding by taking into account only the topology of reference molecules. Several descriptors have been successfully applied for rescaffolding purposes, e. g. CATS (includin...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} {{in the application of}} the overlapping waves model (Siegler, 1996) to monitor developments in children’s thinking across a diverse range of educational contexts. The present work examines the extent to which this model {{can be applied to the}} context of a nonalgorithmic domain: children’s early reading and spelling using immediately retrospective self-report methodology. We examined (i) abundant variability, (ii) adaptive choice and (iii) gradual change in strategy choice in children’s reading and spelling performance on three regular intervals over a period of three months. Studying within-child performance over time revealed strong individual differences in reading and spelling performance and evidence that the children were strategically choosing relevant strategies on a trial-by-trial basis. Indeed, despite showing within-child variability across the trials, there was a general shift in children’s choice of strategies, moving away from relying on less efficient <b>back-up</b> <b>strategies</b> (alphabetic decoding, analogy) to direct retrieval methods. It is expected that these findings will help to illustrate the importance of self-reflection (or self explanation) of strategy choice as an educational tool for enabling children’s developments in reading and spelling. This may lead to a reconceptualisation of some of the current theoretical models of early reading and spelling development (Frith, 1985; Goswami & Bryant, 1990). ...|$|R

The Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) is a transformation program for the ATC system in the United States. The latest estimates by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) show that by 2018 NextGen will reduce total delays in flight by 35 percent and provide 23 billion dollars in cumulative benefits. A satellite-based technology called the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system {{is one of the most}} important elements in NextGen. FAA expects that ADS-B systems will be available in the National Airspace System (NAS) by 2020. However, an alternative surveillance system is needed due to vulnerabilities that exist in ADS-B systems. Multilateration has a high accuracy performance and is believed to be an ideal <b>back-up</b> <b>strategy</b> for ADS-B systems. Thus, in this study, we develop the ADS-B and multilateration sensor fusion algorithm for aircraft tracking applications in ATC. The algorithm contains a fault detection function for ADS-B information monitoring by using Trajectory Change Points reports from ADS-B and numerical vectors from a hybrid estimation algorithm. We consider two types of faults in the ADS-B measurement model to show that the algorithm is able to deal with the bad data from ADS-B systems and automatically select good data from multilateration systems. We apply fuzzy logic concepts and generate time variant parameters during the fusion process. The parameters play a role of weights for combining data from different sensors. The algorithm performance is validated through two aircraft tracking examples. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the challenges faced by the recipients of the child support grant, with special reference to Morgan Bay, a rural area {{under the aegis of}} the Amathole District Municipality in East London. The child support grant is a strategy that was introduced to alleviate poverty in previously disadvantaged communities. The child support grant replaced the state maintenance grant. South Africa has high levels of unemployment; and this situation is considered to be a major contributing factor to poverty. After the apartheid era, the African National Congress (ANC) led government introduced a litany of redistributive policy frameworks aimed at reversing the imbalances of the past created by the apartheid government. The child support grant, which was established during the year 1998, is viewed as one of the strategies introduced by the South African government aimed at alleviating poverty caused by the lack of jobs. The aim of the study is to assess the implementation of the child support grant impact as a developmental strategy in rural communities, such as Morgan Bay. The study seeks to determine how the child support grant redistribution has affected rural communities. In other words, the research seeks to determine whether the child support grant redistribution has affected rural communities positively or negatively, and to ascertain whether it has mitigated the impact of socio-economic challenges in rural communities. The study also seeks to explore other strategies, which could be implemented to supplement the child support grant, and possibly decrease the level of dependence on the child support grant – by having a <b>back-up</b> <b>strategy</b> for alleviating poverty...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{understood}} in car parking behavioural research that sociological, psychological and practical factors determine where a motorist parks and when they decide to do so. Empirical studies from the 1980 s suggested that motorists then adopted a series of strategies when seeking the most suitable space closest to their destination and psychologists have suggested that this was predominantly actioned from the unconscious (i. e. habit). Over {{the last thirty years}} however society has seen a revolution in communications technology, information availability and general travel behaviour and therefore these views on motorist behaviour when searching for a parking space may no longer be valid. To assess this, a survey of motorists was undertaken in 2013 in Brighton and Hove to determine whether the patterns identified in the 1980 ’s data are still in use today and how strategies (if any) of motorists vary according to their socio-demographic characteristics. Key findings include that while motorists still usually head for the same car park initially, there is now often a much clearer <b>back-up</b> <b>strategy</b> if unsuccessful; this may involve cruising (where vehicles seem to be driving around with little purpose), but this is not as random as identified in previous research. Motorists also revealed strong optimism tendencies and often cynical views about real-time parking information. Eight distinct psychographic groups were extracted through cluster analysis, with each group representing a unique combination of preferences, worldviews and attitudes, indicating that different groups may need to be targeted in different ways to optimise the chance of influencing parking behaviour. It is clear from the data that the same parking behaviour can take place for different reasons and that the same attitudes can lead to different behaviours. The implications of this are that local authorities may need to rethink their strategies to best influence motorist parking behaviour. <br/...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Any {{organism}} {{depends on}} its ability to sense temperature and avoid noxious heat. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans responds to noxious temperatures exceeding ∼ 35 °C and also senses changes in its environmental temperature in the range between 15 and 25 °C. The neural circuits and molecular mechanisms involved in thermotaxis have been successfully studied, whereas details of the thermal avoidance behavior remain elusive. In this work, we investigate neurological and molecular aspects of thermonociception using genetic, cell biological and physiological approaches. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show here that the thermosensory neurons AFD, in addition to sensing temperature within the range within which the animals can thrive, also contribute to the sensation of noxious temperatures resulting in a reflex-like escape reaction. Distinct sets of interneurons are involved in transmitting thermonociception and thermotaxis, respectively. Loss of AFD is partially compensated by the activity of a pair of multidendritic, polymodal neurons, FLP, whereas laser ablation of both types of neurons abrogated the heat response in the head of the animals almost completely. A third pair of heat sensory neurons, PHC, is situated in the tail. We find that the thermal avoidance response requires the cell autonomous function of cGMP dependent Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated (CNG) channels in AFD, and the heat- and capsaicin-sensitive Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid (TRPV) channels in the FLP and PHC sensory neurons. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results identify distinct thermal responses mediated by a single neuron, but also show that parallel nociceptor circuits and molecules may be used as <b>back-up</b> <b>strategies</b> to guarantee fast and efficient responses to potentially detrimental stimuli...|$|R

Procedures: Users were recruited through a commercial provider. Qualitative interviews with 10 carers were completed to generate an in-depth description of how the devices were used and the perceived impact. A questionnaire was administered to ascertain sample characteristics. Findings: Most carers preferred to use tracking as a <b>back-up</b> to other <b>strategies</b> of management, particularly supervision by a carer and locked doors. In cases where the carers perceived the risk of harm from getting lost to be low, tracking was used to preserve the independence of the person with dementia. The carers reported that tracking gave them reassurance and also enhanced the sense of independence both for themselves and for the person with dementia. The poor reliability of the device was identified as a substantial limitation. Conclusion: Larger studies are needed to assess the safety and clinical value of GPS tracking. These should explore the views of people with dementia. Assessment tools are needed to assess suitability.

40|$|This Thesis {{deals with}} an {{innovative}} {{approach to the}} design of ground-source heat pump systems (GSHP), based on performance optimization during the entire operational life. Both design and management strategies are taken into account in order to find the optimal level of exploitation of the ground source, minimizing a proper performance index. The proposed method takes into account all the macro-systems governing the energy balance of the GSHP, namely: building thermal energy loads, efficiencies of the heat pump unit and back-up systems, and thermal response of the ground source. For each of them, suitable simulation models are presented and discussed. A rigorous mathematical formulation of the optimal design problem is provided, together with a specific resolution technique. In this regard, we also propose a statistically based evaluation methodology in order to analyze the soundness {{of the results of the}} optimization procedure. The main results of the proposed design and optimization methodology are: thermal capacities of heat pump and back-up generators, length and number of ground heat exchangers and the optimal load share between GSHP and <b>back-up</b> systems (control <b>strategy).</b> If installation costs and energy prices are taken into account, investment figures are also an output. We show how a proper synergy among GSHP and back-up generators leads to notable energetic and economic benefits, ensuring higher energetic performances, lower installation costs, and a sustainable exploitation of the ground-source. The proposed methodology can be conveniently applied to numerous professional, political, economic, and research activities. In this Thesis, we present two case studies. The first one refers to a typical professional design case, showing both the energetic and economic benefits achievable through the illustrated procedure with respect to traditional design methods. The second one illustrates as the proposed methodology can be applied to investigate the technological room for improvement of GSHP technology: in other words, we figure out the subsystem on which technological development should be focused, the expected benefits and some hints about a possible strategy for research activities...|$|R
40|$|This study {{concentrates}} {{on the relationship between}} the students’ thinking styles (Stenberg, 1999) and the strategies (Kirby, 1988) the students employ when dealing with exam-type questions in mathematics. Thinking styles are the “preferred way[s] of using the ability one has” (Sternberg, 1999, p. 8) and are conceptualised to be relatively stable over time and context. A strategy is the “combination of tactics, or a choice of tactics, that forms a coherent plan to solve a problem” (Kirby, 1988, p. 230 - 231). The students’ attainment, the nature of task and the students’ views are also considered in this study. A three-phase study including both quantitative and qualitative techniques was designed with the aim of delineating this relationship. The study was conducted with 2 nd year students (N= 99) following a BSc in Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics of the University of Athens, although, for methodological reasons, additional data were collected from a broader group of undergraduates (NUG= 224). The students’ thinking styles were identified through a version of the Sternberg-Wagner Thinking Styles Inventory (Sternberg, 1999), translated into Greek. Two main Style Cores were identified: Core I (creative, original, critical and non-prioritised thinking) and Core II (procedural, already tested and prioritised thinking). Based on these cores, the students were assigned to two clusters: Cluster 1 C 2 C (High Core I/Low Core II) and Cluster 3 C 4 C (High Core II/Low Core I). In order to identify the students’ strategies, the A-B-Δ strategy classification was introduced, expanding on Weber’s (2005) semantic, syntactic and procedural strategies. The AB-Δ strategies were grouped in three Strategy Types depending on their links with truth,memory and flexibility, respectively identified as: α-type, β-type and δ-type. Students assigned to Cluster 1 C 2 C appeared to prefer more α-type and less β-type Initial Strategies than those assigned to Cluster 3 C 4 C. The nature of the task appeared to affect this link. On the other hand, in the context of Back-Up Strategies, stylistic preferences and ‘high’ attainment appeared to regulate a link between the nature of the task and a <b>Back-Up</b> <b>Strategy,</b> rather than forming a style-strategy link (as in the case of Initial Strategy). Drawing from Skemp’s (1979) views about reality (inner and social) and survival (respectively, internal consistency and social survival), it is argued that the students choose different strategies, because they essentially perceive the given task in qualitatively different ways. The students’ different stylistic preferences indicate differences in their inner reality, thus affecting their choice of an ascertaining argument, which in turn determines their selection of Initial Strategy. The failure of the students’ Initial Strategy leads them to re-evaluate the task itself, thus resulting in a change of the reality in which the students have to survive and this, in turn, determines the students’ Back-Up Strategies...|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{quality in}} {{healthcare}} buildings influences patients’ well-being {{as well as}} staff’s productivity and satisfaction. Particularly, public spaces in a healthcare facility, such as a lobby and waiting areas, create the first impression and shape the experience of healthcare. ^ Improving indoor environmental quality in the public spaces of healthcare facilities can reduce stress and fear in the patients and visitors and positively affect their psychological well-being. Even though several healthcare evaluation systems (e. g., Achieving Excellence Design Evaluation Toolkit) {{have been developed to}} assess indoor environmental quality of major areas of healthcare facilities, no framework has specifically assessed the indoor environmental quality of public spaces in those facilities. To promote healthcare users’ well-being, it is essential to create an indoor environmental quality assessment tool (IEQ) for evaluating public healthcare spaces. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop such tool based on a review of related literature, current certification programs, healthcare organizational standards, and reviews of the developed assessment tool from healthcare design professionals. ^ To verify the validity of the IEQ, the study used Delphi technique. Three Delphi panel groups (researchers, designers, and practitioners) reviewed and provided feedback on the elements of the assessment tool. The researchers revised the IEQ according to the Delphi panels 2 ̆ 7 feedback. Subsequently, the researchers and two healthcare professional volunteers designed case studies to test the usability, viability, and reliability of the newly developed IEQ. ^ The tool assesses three sub-categories, including the visual environment (daylighting, artificial lighting, quality of view, visual stimuli ornaments, architectural structure, color coordination, and natural environment), the auditory environment (noise level, environmental surfaces, environmental intervention, and background music), and indoor air quality (thermal comfort, CO 2 level, and odor). The developed assessment tool includes detailed knowledge, design <b>strategies,</b> <b>back-up</b> calculations and questions in technical language. The IEQ is separated into three parts: (1) measurement, (2) observation, and (3) rubric. The measure can be used to compare the ideal and actual healthcare environments. ^ The findings demonstrated the importance of the indoor environmental quality in the healthcare facilities and result in the finalized assessment tool. By evaluating an indoor environmental quality of healthcare facilities located in the U. S., this research study could provide a systematic approach to identifying weaknesses and strengths of indoor environmental quality in healthcare. Healthcare professionals can use IEQ measure to identify and solve environmental quality problems in the healthcare settings. This study could provide actual numeric values of indoor environmental quality, which managers and healthcare industry stakeholders can use as a marketing tool or benchmarking process. ^ The IEQ could be used to gather the data that would allow healthcare professionals to make future design decisions. Moreover, the study can provide information that could improve the well-being and healing environment of patients and visitors in a healthcare building. Increasing visitors’ satisfaction with the environment, their satisfaction would enhance their overall hospital experiences with the healthcare service, measured by the national standard survey instrument Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Provider and System (HCAHPS). ...|$|R
