5|$|During {{his second}} term, Ross {{was forced to}} {{intervene}} in the Jaybird-Woodpecker War in Fort Bend County. Sheriff Jim Garvey feared there would be armed battles between the white supremacist Democrats (the Jaybirds) and the <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had retained political power (who, with their white supporters, were known as Woodpeckers). At Garvey's request, Ross sent two militia companies, which managed to impose a four-month peace. In August 1889, Ross sent four Texas Rangers, including Sergeant Ira Aten, to quell the unrest. Violence erupted, leaving four people dead and injuring six, including a Ranger. Aten wired Ross for help. The following morning, the Houston Light Guard arrived and instituted martial law; that evening, Ross arrived with an Assistant Attorney General and another militia company. Ross fired all the local civil officials and called together representatives from both factions. On his suggestion, the two groups agreed to choose a mutually acceptable sheriff to replace Garvey, who had been killed in the firefight. When they could not agree on a candidate, Ross suggested Aten; both groups finally agreed, thus halting the conflict.|$|E
25|$|Antislavery {{interests}} {{petitioned the}} convention to abolish slavery, which {{was rejected by}} the convention delegates. The constitution adopted increased opportunities for citizens to engage in the political process, but it limited suffrage to white males. Similarly to other southern states, such as Virginia, it disfranchised free <b>black</b> <b>men,</b> <b>who</b> had had the right to vote under the 1796 constitution. That followed fears raised by the 1831 Nat Turner slave rebellion.|$|E
25|$|Groups {{may differ}} in how a disease progresses. <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were {{diagnosed}} with HIV generally fared worse than their white and Hispanic counterparts. The percentage of men studied with very low CD4+ T-cell count, defined as fewer than 50 cells per microliter, at AIDS diagnosis was 24.1% for white men, 27.8% for Hispanic men, and 34.4% for Black men. Black men were also {{significantly less likely to}} be alive three years after diagnosis (80.6%) than Hispanic or white men, who had 85.2% and 84.5% survival rates, respectively. However, the reasons for these differences are not clear, and should not be understood as an essential difference between races, but rather as effects of social and environmental factors.|$|E

500|$|When Roy Bryant was {{informed}} {{of what had}} happened, he aggressively questioned several young <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> entered the store. That evening, Bryant, with a black man named J. W. Washington, approached a [...] black teenager walking along a road. Bryant ordered Washington to seize the boy, {{put him in the}} back of a pickup truck, and took him to be identified by a companion of Carolyn's who had witnessed the episode with Till. Friends or parents vouched for the boy in Bryant's store, and Carolyn's companion denied that the boy Bryant and Washington seized was the one who had accosted her. Somehow, Bryant learned that the boy in the incident was from Chicago and was staying with Mose Wright. Several witnesses overheard Bryant and his 36-year-old half-brother, John William [...] "J. W."

[...] The ACNO and NERL joined together to hire Jones as the defense attorney for all 99 of the convicted men. [...] The NAACP hired former state attorney general George W.

[...] The first of the black units, the 99th Fighter Squadron, trained at an airfield in Tuskegee, Alabama, which {{gave rise to the}} name [...] "Tuskegee Airmen" [...] as a blanket term for the Army's black aviators. [...] Under the command of Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., the first African American to fly [...] as an officer, the 99th saw action in North Africa and Italy in 1943.

2500|$|When {{black men}} wished to become Masons {{in the new}} nation the white members of the Lodge had to {{unanimously}} vote to accept a petitioner to receive Masonic degrees. If one white person voted against the petitioner that person would be rejected. In a letter by General Albert Pike to his brother in 1875 he said, [...] "I am not inclined to mettle in the matter. I took my obligations to white men, not to Negroes. When I have to accept Negroes as brothers or leave Masonry, I shall leave it." [...] Masonic and Grand Lodges generally excluded African Americans. Since the votes were anonymous, {{it was impossible to}} identify the member who had voted against accepting a black member. The effect was the <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had legitimately been made Masons in integrated jurisdictions could be rejected. Racial segregation existed until the 1960s and still persists in some jurisdictions.|$|E
