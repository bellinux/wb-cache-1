5|$|Throughout {{his life}} in {{politics}} and his long military career he characterised the arrogant and extravagant aristocrat of the period. His progression through the Army was marked by many episodes of extraordinary incompetence, but this can be measured against his generosity to the men under his command and genuine bravery. As {{a member of the}} landed aristocracy he had actively and steadfastly opposed any political reform in Britain, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> year of his life he relented and came to acknowledge that such reform would bring benefit to all classes of society.|$|E
5|$|When the {{competition}} was revived in the 1990s, {{for the first two}} seasons all English sides playing in the First Division (2nd level) participated, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> two tournaments only 8 English teams played. In 1994/95, two of the clubs relegated from the Premiership were joined by six teams that had just missed out on promotion. For 1995/96, only one relegated Premiership team competed – most of the remaining teams had finished in mid-table or lower table in the previous First Division campaign, and Birmingham City had just been promoted from Division Two.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the last}} round of matches, Al-Talaba had 17 points and Al-Shorta had 15. Al-Talaba winning in {{the last round}} and Al-Shorta losing or drawing would secure the title for Al-Talaba <b>but,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> match, they lost 1–2 against Al-Tayaran and Al-Shorta won 3–0 against Al-Zawra'a to create a tie on points and goal difference, Al-Shorta had scored more goals than Al-Talaba and {{therefore}} {{were expected to be}} crowned champions, but the Iraq FA ruled that the greater number of wins should take precedence and declared Al-Talaba as champions. This was a controversial decision at the time as {{it was the first time}} such a phenomenon had happened in Iraqi football.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{dermatologist}} Frederick Parkes Weber {{wrote an}} article about von Recklinghausen disease in the British Journal of Dermatology. erroneously citing Merrick {{as an example of}} the disease, which German pathologist Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen had described in 1882, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> year has been found that this conjecture was wrong. In fact, symptoms that are always present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin, and (which is a peculiar characteristic of this disease) the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called café au lait spots.; however, these spots were never observed on Merrick's body. For this reason, although this diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnosis were advanced, such as those of who suffer Maffucci syndrome and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (Albright's disease).|$|E
5|$|Celski {{advanced}} to finals of the 1500m after winning 1st {{place in the}} heats, quarterfinals, and semifinals. During the finals, Celski was in the lead with about five laps to go, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> few laps, the three Korean skaters managed to overtake him, sweeping the podium with Kwak Yoon-Gy in 1st. Celski finished in 4th place, in front of teammate Travis Jayner, who came in 6th. The next day, Celski competed in the 500m. During the semifinals, Celski attempted a pass from fourth to third place, but during his pass, François-Louis Tremblay of Canada, in second place at the time, fell, tripping Celski on his way down. Celski finished the race in 3rd, but was then disqualified, while Tremblay advanced. In the 1000m, Celski finished third behind Lee Ho-Suk and Kwak Yoon-Gy {{with a time of}} 1:27.515. In the 3000m, Celski again placed third behind Lee Ho-Suk and Kwak Yoon-Gy. Celski finished fourth overall with 39 points. Celski then combined with Jordan Malone, Travis Jayner, and Simon Cho in the 5000m relay to finish second behind South Korea with a time of 6:46.205.|$|E

5|$|February {{began with}} another SEC match-up, this time against unranked Alabama. Starter Kyra Elzy tore her ACL {{during the game}} ending her season, during this game, while going up for a rebound. Meanwhile, Alabama was keeping close to the Lady Vols, by slowing the game down. At half time, Tennessee only had a 13-point lead. The team never did shake off the Crimson Tide, but did manage {{to pull out the}} win, 73–66. A trip to Ole Miss was next, and the team started off much better, score the first ten points of the game and having a 54–17 lead at halftime. Summitt let the bench play the rest of the game, {{ultimately}} winning 91–45. This game was followed up by a non-conference match against longtime rival Old Dominion, whom Tennessee had beaten in the previous year's national championship. The game was even for fifteen minutes, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> five minutes of the half, Tennessee was able to build a twelve-point lead. Holdsclaw took over the second half for the Lady Vols, scoring 24 points for an 85–61 victory, ODU's biggest loss in four years. This match was followed up with another conference game, this time against the Mississippi State Bulldogs. UT started out sloppily, and ended the half with only a nine-point lead. However, once again the team came out strong to open the second half, raising their lead and eventually had double State's points, with ten minutes remaining. The Bulldogs cut the lead to eleven, but then Summitt put Holdsclaw back in, scoring eight in a row, giving Tennessee another victory, 74–52.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the late}} 1950s, Reno was the {{gambling}} {{capital of the}} United States, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> twenty years Las Vegas' rapid growth, American Airlines' 2000 buyout of Reno Air, {{and the growth of}} Native American gaming in California have reduced its business.

25|$|Gatchina Palace, {{completed}} by Antonio Rinaldi in 1781, became Paul's residence in 1783; formally, {{it was his}} property and Pavlovsk became property of Maria Fyodorovna. Paul associated Rinaldi's style with Orlov brothers, murderers of his fathers, and immediately launched remodeling of the palace. Paul and Maria's private suites were redesigned in austere styling with inexpensive materials, in contrast with lavishly decorated public halls. Until 1790 Paul lived a quiet life of a landlord, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> six years of Catherine's reign (1790–1796) Gatchina became a base for Paul's private militarized party, called Gatchintsy or Ostrogoths.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, {{though he}} had such poor support that Northamptonshire only twice reached 300 in an innings and in one game against Worcestershire he scored 141 out of 199 before being ninth out, Bakewell {{improved}} considerably upon his 1934 form and played with considerable success in two Tests against South Africa. Northamptonshire's dependence upon him was starkly seen in that he averaged 42 an innings and nobody else did better than 23. The following year he was not as consistent, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> match he played a magnificent unbeaten innings of 241 against the strong bowling of Derbyshire - who had sealed their only ever County Championship title - to almost give Northamptonshire an elusive victory.|$|E
25|$|Durham played three Championship {{matches in}} June, and {{although}} they missed Paul Collingwood for {{two of them and}} Steve Harmison and Mike Hussey for all three, due to international duties, they won one and drew two to stretch their unbeaten run to eight - keeping them 21 points ahead of second-placed Worcestershire when the teams broke off to play Twenty20 cricket. There were also two National League matches - Durham beat Derbyshire to get revenge for the C Trophy loss a month earlier, which gave them a six-point lead, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> match before the summer break Sussex Sharks beat them by seven wickets, to close the gap to two points.

25|$|It {{is argued}} that the {{rationale}} behind this law is that an iambic word {{at the beginning of}} the third metron might give the false impression that the line had come to an end.
