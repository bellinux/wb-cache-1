40|$|Beer {{contains}} {{a variety of}} proteins and polypeptides, most of them originate from the proteolytic and chemical modifications of barley proteins occurring during brewing. In beer {{there are only a}} part of <b>barley</b> water <b>soluble</b> proteins, previously extracted, with molecular weights (MW) ranging from approximately 5 up to more than 100 kDa. However only two major proteins have been characterized, one of MW of 40 kDa, derived almost unmodified, from barley albumin protein Z and another with MW of about 10 kDa corresponding to lipid transfer protein 1 of barley (BLTP 1). In this study we analyzed the protein component modifications during brewing in order to evaluate the technological and healthy importance of beer protein fractions...|$|R
40|$|Barley and malt proteins, of {{infusion}} (IoB) and decoction (EBC) mashing worts as well {{as commercial}} wort and beer, obtained from the Castlemaine Perkins brewery, Brisbane, were gel filtered, with or without further treatments. A general, similar pattern of protein and peptide profiles emerged from barley malt and beer. This confirmed the widely assumed fact that beer proteins descend from barley, some transformed and others perhaps mostly unchanged by processing. In the gel-filtrate profiles, a maximum of 8 or 9 fractions were discerned. These fractions were collected and quantified for protein contents and amino acid compositions. The first four fractions contained the proteins and polypeptides of molecular weight higher than 14, 000. Consequently, the remaining fractions contain the smaller peptides (< 14, 000), that were completely removed by dialysis. The effects of processing on proteins and peptides varied contingent upon the type of processing step considered and the pre-chromatographic treatment. Malting was the most effective process remarkably increasing the soluble protein contents, especially the smaller peptide fractions and the colour development. This is the first report, {{as far as we}} are aware of, on the gel filtration profiles of wort and beer low molecular weight peptides including those of barley wort. The importance of the smaller peptides in foam formation and retention cannot be overemphasised. The amino acid composition of the fractions revealed much more diversity than was observed in the comparison of the profiles. Proline content of fraction 1 resembled that of <b>barley</b> <b>soluble</b> proteins while fractions F 2, F 3 and F 4 that of glutelin and only fraction 8 that of hordein. The latter, suggests that hordeins or, at least the peptide products rich in proline, are likely to be completely digested to amino acids, during malting. ...|$|R
40|$|Numerous studies {{reveal the}} {{cardiovascular}} benefits of consuming dietary fiber and, especially, cereal fiber. Cereal fiber {{is associated with}} cardiovascular risk reduction through multiple mechanisms and consuming a variety of cereal fiber sources offers health benefits specific to the source. Certain cereal fibers have been studied more extensively than others and provide greater support for their incorporation into a healthful diet. β-glucan from oats or barley, {{or a combination of}} whole oats and <b>barley,</b> and <b>soluble</b> fiber from psyllium reduces the risk of coronary heart disease; inulin-type fructans added to foods and beverages may modestly decrease serum triacylglycerols; arabinoxylan and resistant starch may improve glycemic control. Individuals with low cereal fiber intake should increase their intake of whole grains in order to receive the benefits of whole grains in addition to fiber. For those adjusting to the texture and palatability of whole grains, turning to added-fiber products rich in β-glucan and psyllium may allow them to reach their fiber goals without increasing caloric intake...|$|R
40|$|The newly {{developed}} barley-flaxseed composites were unique because <b>barley</b> provides the <b>soluble</b> fiber β -glucan that is {{beneficial for improving}} food texture and preventing coronary heart disease along with {{the health benefits of}} omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (w - 3 PUFAs) of flaxseed. The new composites of barley with flaxseeds were prepared using prowashonupana, a barley variety containing high β -glucan content, with 10, 20, and 50 % flaxseed for enhancing health benefits of functional food. Besides the nutritional aspects of barley-flaxseed composites, they have improved water holding capacities, texture, and useful pasting and viscoelastic qualities measured using a Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) followed by an advanced rheometer. The pasting and rheological properties of the barley flour were not greatly influenced by 10 % ground flaxseed replacements but showed differences at the 50 % replacement level. Shear thinning properties were observed for all the composites. These functional composites could be valuable and applicable for developing new functional food products with health benefits of decreasing heart problems, diabetes, and obesity along with providing desirable texture. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{association}} between nitrate reductase (NR) and membranes was examined. Nitrate reductase activity (NRA) associated with the microsomal fraction of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) roots amounted to 0. 6 to 0. 8 % of soluble NRA following sonication {{in the presence of}} 250 mM KI and repeated osmotic shock. This treatment removed all contaminating soluble NRA from microsomes of uninduced barley roots that had been homogenized in a soluble extract from roots of NO 3 (-) -induced plants. On continuous sucrose gradients, NRA co-migrated specifically with VO 4 (-) -sensitive ATPase activity, a plasma membrane (PM) marker; activity of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, assayed as cytosolic marker, co-migrated with NRA. Microsomal NRA was absent in <b>barley</b> deficient in <b>soluble</b> NR. Perturbation and trypsinolysis experiments with PM vesicles isolated by aqueous two-phase partitioning indicated that NR is associated with the periphery of the cytoplasmic face of the bilayer. These results demonstrate that PM and soluble NRs are essentially the same protein but that the membrane-associated form is tightly bound. Although it is possible that PM-associated NR exists in vivo, unequivocal evidence for this has yet to be shown. However, PM NR is definitely present in vitro...|$|R
40|$|The cereal non-starch {{polysaccharide}} dietary fibres beta-glucan and arabinoxylan (AX), which {{can contribute to}} health, occur both under a soluble and an insoluble form. The latter can enzymically be solubilised. Barley and wheat, rich in beta-glucan and AX respectively, can thus be valuable sources of soluble fibre. The objective of Solfibread, an EU sponsored research project (www. solfibread. com), was to enhance the health promoting effect of bread by providing and implementing technologies for increased <b>barley</b> and wheat <b>soluble</b> fibre levels in consumer acceptable staple food bread products. Specific objectives were to optimise the production of barley flour {{both in terms of}} nutritional as well as functional effects, to investigate the functional potential of barley proteins, to identify efficient endoxylanases and characterise barley endoxylanase inhibitors, to investigate the beta-glucan in breadmaking and to optimise the production of bread containing milled barley products in terms of both health promoting and organoleptic properties. We demonstrate that we were successful in developing and industrially implementing technology for milling hull-less barley into flour. We were equally successful in the development of palatable breads with added value in terms of health promoting effects through increasing the levels of both soluble beta-glucan and AX and new enzyme technologies. status: accepte...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 90 - 95). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Sorghum bran, barley flour, and flaxseed were substituted at different levels to achieve an acceptable bread formulation. The sorghum bran was substituted at 5 - 10 % of the total flour while barley flour and flaxseed remained constant at 5 and 2 %, respectively. The barley flour was also substituted at 5 - 10 % of wheat flour while sorghum bran and flaxseed were constant at 5 and 2 %. The brans and barley flour were analyzed for dietary fiber, phenols, tannins, anthocyanins, and ORAC values. Effects of substitutions on bread qualities were evaluated and optimum levels of use determined. The sorghum bran was highest in dietary fiber (45 %), tannins, phenols, and ORAC value. The barley flour contained less dietary fiber (13. 9 %) but higher levels of b-glucans (4. 4 %). The flaxseed contained omega- 3 fatty acids and dietary fiber (28 %). The higher percentages of sorghum bran or barley flour reduced specific volumes and increased firmness. The optimum levels of 6 % sorghum bran and 5 % barley flour were chosen based on bread qualities and dietary fiber levels. The amount of flaxseed was increased from 2 to 5 %, increasing the amount of omega- 3 fatty acids. The bread prepared using the "Breadmix" formula was a "good source" of dietary fiber (soluble and insoluble) (~ 3 g/serving). The brown sorghum added significant levels of antioxidants while the flaxseed added a good source of omega- 3 fatty acids (~ 500 mg/serving). The <b>barley</b> flour added <b>soluble</b> fiber content. Breads prepared from the formulated Breadmix were compared to commercially available bread mixes. The Breadmix product had higher specific volume, moisture, texture, darker crumb and crusts, and highest taste/aroma scores and overall acceptability in sensory analysis. Commercial variety bread properties were similar to those of 24 hour old bread prepared from the Breadmix. Under proper storage conditions, the Breadmix remained stable for 3 months. Significant amounts of dietary fiber, antioxidants, and omega- 3 fatty acids are present in the Breadmix and could be promoted as a nutraceutical product...|$|R
40|$|The {{physiological}} {{characteristics of}} native and bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) in oats and barley-based fermented products were studied {{in relation to}} the physico-chemical properties. Article I presents a parallel-randomized double blind clinical trial using a dairy-based product (control), an oat-based product (fermented with V 2, which is a mixture (1 : 1) of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. Thermophilus / Lactobacillus acidophilus) and a ropy, oat-based product (fermented with V 2 / Pediococcus damnosus 2. 6 (Pd)). The total cholesterol level in subjects fed the ropy, oat-based product was significantly reduced from 6. 08 mmol/L to 5. 82 mmol/L (4. 3 %), P = 0. 007 and this decrease differed significantly (6 %, P = 0. 022) from the value obtained for the group fed the dairy-based (control) product. A drop of 5. 5 % in LDL-cholesterol was also observed as compared with the run-in value in the group fed ropy, oat-based product. In article II, the ability of different lactic acid bacteria to influence the physico-chemical characteristics (content, viscosity and molecular weight) of dietary fibre in ?-glucan rich barley and oat concentrates was investigated. Two methodologies, one including filtration and another centrifugation-dialysis, to quantify the dietary fibre, were compared. The centrifugation-dialysis method generally resulted in significantly (P < 0. 05) higher values than the filtration method with the exception of <b>soluble</b> <b>barley</b> fibres. The insoluble fibre content was found to decrease after fermentation. The maximum viscosity of the soluble fibre in oat fibre concentrates decreased after fermentation. However, the molecular weight was apparently not affected. In article III, the molar mass and rheological properties of an exopolysaccharide (EPS) from Pediococcus damnosus 2. 6 were investigated. The EPS was observed to be a flexible chain polymer with molar mass, 4. 0 x 106 gmol- 1. Rheological behaviour of the EPS was compared to that of a commercial cereal ?-glucan (0. 359 x 106 gmol- 1). The maximum storage modulus G´max for EPS solution was lower than that for the cereal ?-glucan at all concentrations while the relaxation time, trelax was higher. In article IV, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) formation in rats fed fermented oat fibre concentrates was compared with that of rats fed native oat fibre concentrate. All the fermented fibre concentrates resulted in a higher propionic acid concentration in the distal colon (P< 0. 05), while rats fed Pd fermented fibre concentrate gave lower concentration of butyric acid (P< 0. 05, P< 0. 01) {{in all parts of the}} hindgut as compared with rats fed the native fibre concentrates. The fermented fibre concentrates seemed to favour the formation of acetic and propionic acid, while the native fibre concentrate favoured the formation of butyric acid...|$|R
