40|$|International audienceUntil now, all reports {{state that}} during {{eversion}} <b>of</b> the drone <b>endophallus,</b> two substances are ejected, viz. semen and mucus, {{and that the}} mating sign of a queen bee consists <b>of</b> the <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> the <b>endophallus</b> filled with mucus. I examined substances ejected during eversion of drone endophalli, as well as substances present in the mating sign. In the fully everted endophallus, creamy semen was found near the chitinized plates, amorphous white mucus was located further distally and a transparent-whitish condensed substance appeared at the end <b>of</b> the everted <b>endophallus.</b> In mating signs, white mucus was found near the bursa copulatrix of the queens and a transparent-whitish condensed substance in the distal part of the sign. Microscopic examinations showed that the transparent-whitish substance consisted of fragments of epithelial membranes sloughed from mucus glands. Thus, not two substances, but three, viz. semen, mucus and epithelial membranes, are ejected during endophallus eversion and natural mating with queen bees...|$|R
2500|$|Mating {{between a}} single drone {{and the queen}} lasts less than 5 seconds, and it is often {{completed}} within 1–2 seconds. Mating occurs mid-flight, and 10–40m above ground. [...] Since the queen mates with 12±7 drones, and drones die after mating, each drone must {{make the most of}} his single shot. The drone makes first contact from above the queen, his thorax above her abdomen, straddling her. [...] He then grasps her with all six legs, and everts the endophallus into her opened sting chamber. If the queen’s sting chamber is not fully opened, mating is unsuccessful, so some males that mount the queen do not transfer semen. Once the endophallus has been everted, the drone is paralyzed, flipping backwards as he ejaculates. [...] The process of ejaculation is explosive—semen is blasted through the queen’s sting chamber and into the oviduct. The process is sometimes audible to the human ear, akin to a [...] "popping" [...] sound. The ejaculation is so powerful that it ruptures the endophallus, disconnecting the drone from the queen. The <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> the <b>endophallus</b> is broken off inside of the queen during mating—so drones mate only once, and die shortly after. The leftover penis remaining in the queen’s vagina {{is referred to as the}} “mating sign”. The plug will not prevent the next drone from mating with the same queen, but may prevent semen from flowing out of the vagina.|$|R

50|$|In lithic analysis, a {{subdivision}} <b>of</b> archaeology, a <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> applied force (also {{known as a}} <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> percussion or simply <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> force) is a defining characteristic of a lithic flake. <b>Bulb</b> <b>of</b> applied force was first correctly described by Sir John Evans, the cofounder of prehistoric archeology. However, <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> percussion was coined scientifically by W.J. Sollas. When a flake is detached from its parent core, {{a portion of the}} Hertzian cone of force caused by the detachment blow is detached with it, leaving a distinctive bulb on the flake and a corresponding flake scar on the core. In the case of a unidirectional core, the <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> applied force is produced by an initiated crack formed at the point of contact, which begins producing the Hertzian cone. The outward pressure increases causing the crack to curve away from the core and the bulb formation. The <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> applied force forms below the striking platform as a slight bulge. If the flake is completely crushed the bulb will not be visible. <b>Bulbs</b> <b>of</b> applied force may be distinctive, moderate, or diffuse, depending upon the force of the blow used to detach the flake, and upon the type of material used as a fabricator. The <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> applied force can indicate the mass or density of the tool used in the application of the force. The bulb may also be an indication of the angle of the force. This information is helpful to archaeologists in understanding and recreating the process of flintknapping. Generally, the harder the material used as a fabricator, the more distinctive the <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> applied force. Soft hammer percussion has a low diffuse bulb while hard hammer percussion usually leaves a more distinct and noticeable <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> applied force. Pressure flake also allowed for diffuse <b>bulbs.</b> The <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> percussion of a flake or blade is convex and the core has a corresponding concave bulb. The concave bulb on the core is known as the negative <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> percussion. <b>Bulbs</b> <b>of</b> applied force are not usually present if the flake has been struck off naturally. This allows archaeologists to identify and distinguish natural breakage from human artistry. The three main bulb types are flat or nondescript, normal, and pronounced. A flat or nondescript bulb is poorly defined and does not rise up on the ventral surface. A normal bulb on the ventral side has average height and well-defined. A pronounced bulb rises up on ventral side and is very large.|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: Despite {{morphological}} {{and molecular}} data analysed so far, phylogenetic relationships of many lineages of genus Carabus Linnaeus 1758 (Carabini, Carabinae, Carabidae) present in Europe, {{have not been}} yet fully understood and molecular data have not been fully integrated with the morphological classifications. The aim {{of this research was}} to: (i) complement the phylogenetic relationships in the systematics of carabids within the genus Carabus with endemic species from Dinaric karst not included so far in molecular systematics research, and to (ii) examine the degree of matching of the molecular data with the existing morphological classifications based on the structure of frontal shields of larvae and the structure <b>of</b> the <b>endophallus</b> in adult specimens. Materials and Methods: In this research, phylogenetic relationships between 31 species from genus Carabus were analysed. Analyses were based on the DNA sequences of mitochondrial gene for cytochrome c oxidase subunit I. For phylogenetic inference maximum likelihood and Bayesian analysis methods were used. Results: The obtained results showed a greater concordance of molecular data with the classifications based on the structure <b>of</b> <b>endophallus</b> than with the classification based on structure of frontal shields of larvae. The results mainly corresponded to the phylograms in the previous studies confirming the taxonomic status of some species. For three species, Carabus creutzeri and C. parreyssi alpine-dinaric endemic species and C. ulrichi, all included {{for the first time in}} molecular analysis, results indicated taxonomic congruence of molecular data with the classification based on the structure <b>of</b> <b>endophallus.</b> Conclusions: Systematic categories within the genus Carabus cannot be based only on the structure <b>of</b> the <b>endophallus,</b> but the results of molecular analysis should also be included. As the topology of several groups still remains uncertain, molecular phylogeny requires further investigations with a larger data set and additional molecular markers. Carabus species from the western part of Balkan Peninsula, mainly endemics, have been under-represented in hitherto molecular systematic analyses. Further studies, including their distribution and ecology as well as studies including other Balkan’s endemic species are required to explain speciation events. This study contributes to the Barcode of Life Initiative...|$|R
