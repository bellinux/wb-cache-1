40|$|The {{basic design}} {{features}} of the Rancho Anthropomorphic Manipulator (RAM), <b>bilateral</b> <b>manipulator</b> system are reported. In contrast with other previous electrically powered manipulators, the RAM features increased payload capability, structural integrity, position control, {{and the ability to}} interchange its own terminal devices. A set of detailed design drawings and a motion picture are considered...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{and analyses}} several control strategies for generalized, <b>bilateral</b> master/slave <b>manipulator</b> systems. In these manipulators the two arms have different dynamic/kinematic properties which implies {{a more difficult}} control problem. Attention is focused on torque/force driven arms. Required performance for the necessary control computer(s) is discussed...|$|R

50|$|While at Argonne National Laboratory Goertz {{developed}} the master-slave manipulator {{in order to}} safely handle hazardous material from the 100-B plutonium reactor at Hanford. The initial master-slave manipulator device was designed by Goertz in 1948 as a seven-degree-of-freedom bilateral (symmetrical) metal tape transmission pantograph device, which was operated through a leaded glass wall. In 1949 Goertz filed a patent for a mechanical, <b>bilateral</b> master-slave <b>manipulator,</b> and in 1951 Goertz improved upon this design with the first tel-operated articulated arm with a design that relied on mechanical coupling between the master and slave arms through the utilization of steel pulleys and cables. This was a major milestone in force feedback technology and derivatives of this design are still seen today.|$|R
40|$|A {{control scheme}} for linear {{dynamically}} similar <b>bilateral</b> teleoperated <b>manipulator</b> system which {{ensures that the}} closed loop system is energetically passive is proposed. Energetic passivity implies that the teleoperated manipulator system is safe to interact with, and that the coupling between the system and any strictly passive environment is stable. The control objective is for the two manipulators in the system to behave in unison {{under the influence of}} both the operator and the work environment, while maintaining energetic passivity. The dynamics of the system in unison and its response to the operator and work environment can be specified as kinematic and power scalings. To maintain energetic passivity with feedback and feedforward actions, the proposed control makes use of two fictitious internal energy storages. The result is that when the internal state of the storage elements are suitably initialized, the teleoperated manipulator system achieves asymptotic locking even in the presence of external (bounded) forcing from the operator and work environment. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} a <b>bilateral</b> teleoperated <b>manipulator</b> system is considered. The goal of the control are to i) {{coordinate}} the motions of the two manipulators according to a prede ned kinematic scaling, ii) render the dynamics of a locked system, and its response to forces from the human operator and environment to approximate that of prede ned natural dynamics, iii) to provide for possible scaling of power. In addition, for safety reasons, the closed loop system need to remain passive. For linear dynamically similar systems, dynamics of the system can be block diagonalized into two decoupled mechanical systems: the shape system that deals with the coordination error, and the locked system that describe the average motion of the two manipulators. The passive velocity eld control methodology is then applied to the shape system to regulate the coordination error at 0 {{and at the same}} time preserves the passivity of the overall system. ...|$|R
40|$|The random {{time delay}} brings great {{challenges}} to the controller design for the Internet-based teleoperation system, the worst case {{is that it can}} destabilize the Internet-based teleoperation system. This paper first gives a brief historical preview of bilateral passive control theory, and then a direct passive scattering transform method, extending the passive bilateral control method to the Internet-based random time delay teleoperation system, is advanced to guarantee the teleoperation systemâ€™s stability with any non-symmetric random network time delay. Finally, a virtual master-slave <b>manipulator</b> <b>bilateral</b> control scheme is designed for mobile robot teleoperation based on the passive scattering transformation method, and simulations are carried out to verify the results {{at the end of this}} paper.

40|$|Significant {{research}} {{have been conducted}} {{in the field of}} Internet-based teleoperation. However, {{there is a lack of}} objective performance measures beyond completion time, which is dependent on several external factors to the system. This paper develops the concept of event-synchronization for supermedia enhanced Internet based teleoperation systems. Supermedia is the term used to refer to the different feedback streams; for example, video, haptic, temperature and others. This performance measure or system property is not affected by external factors; such as, the human operator and the communication characteristics. In addition, the design, which is based on Petri Net theory, of systems satisfying this property is detailed. The experimental results obtained using a mobile <b>manipulator</b> <b>bilateral</b> teleoperation system are given. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} how to establish performance charts for selection of network parameters for effective utilization of a <b>bilateral</b> teleoperated <b>manipulator</b> working under a wireless communication channel. The {{goal is to}} construct a set of charts that help researchers and engineers to select appropriate parameters of wireless network setup for a known configuration of environment obstruction. To achieve this goal, a teleoperated setup comprising a master haptic device, a slave manipulator dynamic simulator, and a communication channel emulated using the NS 2 simulator, is first developed. Next, performance indices are defined to evaluate the quality of position tracking of the slave manipulator end-effector and force tracking of the master haptic. Three indices, chosen in this paper, are: the integral of squared position and force errors, the integral of absolute position and force error, and the amplitude of position and force overshoot. Extensive experiments on the developed setup are then conducted to study effects of time-varying packet loss {{on the performance of}} the teleoperated system. The largest mean packet loss, at which the system exhibits satisfactory tracking, is then quantified. This packet loss is used as an indicator to define regions representing the quality of tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated by testing a fully-instrumented hydraulically-actuated system under various real wireless channel scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The Space Shuttle EVA on-orbit {{satellite}} servicing {{time is a}} scare commodity {{which has}} been limited for each mission to two 6 -hour work periods with an intervening 40 -hour rest period. New complex missions being planned require more servicing than two EVA's can accommodate. The GSFC (Goddard Space Flight Center) Satellite Servicing Project has been working for several years to develop a Serving Aid Tool to effectively extend this on-orbit servicing capability by IVA {{to the point that}} use of a master-slave <b>bilateral</b> force reflecting <b>manipulator</b> is now planned. This will be controlled from the Shuttle aft flight deck by the RMS mission specialist using a miniature hand controller while outfitted with a physical restraint system. This development is being done on a low cost basis using demonstrated state-of-the-art commercial teleoperated system hardware and software upgraded for space flight use...|$|R
