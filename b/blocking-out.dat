5000|$|Although KDOC {{continues}} to carry MeTV on subchannel 56.3, KVME in Bishop became affiliated with MeTV on April 30, 2012. That station carries MeTV on their primary digital channel 20 (virtual channel 20.1), {{which is also}} available on the DirecTV and Dish Network local packages tier for the Los Angeles market. Both stations market the subchannel as [...] "Me-TV Hollywood", changing from KDOC's previous brand of [...] "Me-TV Los Angeles". Local advertising for MeTV Hollywood is sold by a jointly managed ad sales team for both stations. However, KNET's MeTV feed does not carry the full schedule of programming, electing to carry Spanish-language religious and paid programming during the early morning weekday hours of 5:30 to 8am, <b>blocking-out</b> regularly-scheduled programming in those hours. The KDOC version airs all programming intact.|$|E
5000|$|Her {{documentary}} Ima {{shows her}} fight {{to uncover the}} secrets of her grandmother's survival during the Holocaust. Her style is [...] "very personal yet without being intrusive." [...] The result is [...] "a very honest, unpathetic exploration of the 'third generation'." [...] The film won the Findling Award and the Bayerische Dokumentarfilmpreis - Junger Löwe in 2002. Its short version Matrilineal was shown at the International Critic's Week or Sémaine de la critique 2003 during the Cannes Film Festival. Matrilineal was awarded the Jameson Short Film Award in 2002 because of its originality [...] "in portraying {{how difficult it is}} to overcome the often essential self-protection of <b>blocking-out</b> terrible events and how liberating dialogue can be. The accent within the film is not so much on the final statement, as on showing the difficult ways needed to break down self-built barriers. The movement of the excellent camerawork underlines the authenticity of the psychological process involved." ...|$|E
40|$|The current {{research}} examined how drivers handle task-demands induced {{by listening to}} the radio while driving. In particular, we explored the traces of a possible cognitive strategy that might be used by drivers to cope with task-demands, namely <b>blocking-out</b> auditory distracters. In Study 1 (N = 15), participants listened to a radio-broadcast while watching traffic videos on a screen. Based on a recall task asking about what they had listened to, we created baseline scores reflecting the general levels of <b>blocking-out</b> of radio-content when there was no concurrent driving task accompanying the radio-listening. In Study 2 (N = 46), participants were asked to complete two drives in the simulator: one drive in high-complexity traffic and another in low-complexity traffic. About half of the participants listened to a radio-broadcast while driving, and the other half drove in silence. The radio-listeners were given the same recall task that we had used in Study 1. The results revealed that the participants who drove while {{listening to the radio}} (Study 2) recalled less material from the radio-broadcast as compared to the participants who did not drive (Study 1). In addition, the participants who drove while listening to the radio recalled less talk-radio excerpts when driving in high-complexity traffic than when driving in low-complexity traffic. Importantly, listening to the radio did not impair driving performance. Together, these findings indicate that <b>blocking-out</b> radio-content might indeed be a strategy used by drivers to maintain their driving performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Die theoretisch begründete Skepsis gegenüber einer gelingenden Verbindung von Kunst und Schule steht realgeschichtlich einer vielgestaltigen kunstorientierten Arbeit an Schulen gegenüber, die derzeit durch den Ausbau der Ganztagsschule noch vorangetrieben wird. In diesem Beitrag werden Ergebnisse aus einer Schulkulturanalyse präsentiert, die das kunstbetonte Schulprogramm einer Regelgrundschule in einem sozialen Brennpunktgebiet als in die symbolische Ordnung der Schulkultur eingegangenes ausweisen. Weiterhin werden die aus der Kunstbetonung resultierenden schulkulturellen Strukturproblematiken und die zentralen strukturellen Widersprüche herausgearbeitet: Die Orientierung am realitätsentlasteten Modus ästhetischer Erfahrung legitimiert die Ausblendung der krisenhaften Einbettung der Schule. Diese Form der Krisenlösung stößt jedoch an strukturelle Grenzen, denn auch an einer kunstbetonten Schule bleibt die Schulkultur auf die Vermittlung universell gültiger Wissensbestände bezogen. " (Autorenreferat) "While {{chances for}} {{successful}} school-and-the-arts alliances are viewed with theoretically grounded skepticism, real {{history shows that}} there is a large variety of arts activities at schools. Today, these activities are even further enhanced by the expansion of the all-day school. The results of an analysis of the school culture at a regular elementary school located in a deprived area show that the school program's focu on arts activities has become {{part and parcel of the}} symbolic order of the school's culture. The article further deals with the structural problems on the level of school culture and with the key structural contradictions that result from this focus on arts activities: The <b>blocking-out</b> of the school's crisis-prone embedding is legitimated by the relief from the pressure of reality that is provided by this orientation to the mode of esthetic experience. This form of solution to crisis, however, comes up against structural limitations, for even at a school with a focus on arts activities, school culture is still geared to the imparting of universally valid knowledge.
