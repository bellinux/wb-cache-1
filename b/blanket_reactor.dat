40|$|Greywater {{consists}} of household wastewater excluding toilet discharges. Three systems were compared for the biological treatment of greywater {{at a similar}} hydraulic retention time of approximately 12 – 13 hours. These systems were aerobic treatment in a sequencing batch reactor, anaerobic treatment in an up-flow anaerobic <b>blanket</b> <b>reactor</b> and combined anaerobic-aerobic treatment (up-flow anaerobic <b>blanket</b> <b>reactor</b> + sequencing batch reactor). Aerobic conditions resulted in a COD removal of 90 %, which {{was significantly higher than}} 51 % removal by anaerobic treatment. The low removal in the anaerobic reactor may have been caused by high concentration of anionic surfactants in the influent (43. 5 mg/L) and a poor removal of the colloidal fraction of the COD in up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors. Combined aerobic-anaerobic treatment accomplished a COD removal of 89 %, similar to the aerobic treatment alone. Greywater methanization was 32 % for the anaerobic system and 25 % for the anaerobic-aerobic system, yielding a small amount of energy. Therefore, anaerobic pre-treatment is not feasible and an aerobic system is preferred for the treatment of greywate...|$|E

40|$|High-rate {{anaerobic}} digestion {{can be applied}} in upflow anaerobic sludge <b>blanket</b> <b>reactors</b> {{for the treatment of}} various wastewaters. In upflow anaerobic sludge <b>blanket</b> <b>reactors,</b> sludge retention time is increased by a natural immobilization mechanism (viz. the formation of a granular type of sludge). When this sludge is cultivated on acid-containing wastewater, the granules mainly consist of an acetoclastic methanogen resembling Methanothrix soehngenii. This organism grows either in rods or in long filaments. Attempts to cultivate a stable sludge consisting predominantly of Methanosarcina sp. on an acetate-propionate mixture as substrate by lowering the pH from 7. 5 during the start-up to approximately 6 failed. After 140 days of continuous operation of the reactor a filamentous organism resembling Methanothrix soehngenii prevailed in the sludge.

40|$|Abstract}A novel {{anaerobic}} treatment system, the anaerobic migrating <b>blanket</b> <b>reactor</b> (AMBR), was developed after completing a parallel study with upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) and anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) processes. Using sucrose {{as the main}} component of a synthetic wastewater, the AMBR achieved a maximum chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading rate of 30 g. l 1. day 1 at a 12 -h hydraulic retention time (HRT). This resulted in a standard methane production rate (SMPR) of 6. 5 l. l 1. day 1 and an average methane-based COD (MCOD) removal efficiency of 62. 2 %. A key element in granular biomass formation was migration of the biomass blanket through the reactor. Although a carbohydrate-rich wastewater was used, no separate pre-acidification was required for the AMBR, because of high mixing intensities and wash out of acidogenic bacteria. In contrast, the absence of pre-acidification created ‘‘bulking’ ’ problems (caused by abundant acidogenic bacteria at the surface of granules) in a UASB reactor, operated under conditions {{similar to that of the}} AMBR. As a result, a maximum COD loading rate and SMPR of 21 g. l 1. day 1 and 4. 9 l. l 1. day 1 were achieved, respectively, for the UASB reactor at a 12 -h HRT. These values were 18 g. l 1. day 1 and 3. 7 l. l 1. day 1, respectively, for an ASBR at a 12 -h HRT. Hence, the performance of the AMBR in treating a carbohydrate-rich wastewater was found to be superior in terms of maximum loading rate and SMPR. # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.
