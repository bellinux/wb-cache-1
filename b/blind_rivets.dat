40|$|An {{aggravating}} {{international competition}} {{and the necessity of}} flexible assembling even in single item production systems force the rail vehicle industry to innovative technical solutions including the connection technologies. Therefore, screw connections with <b>blind</b> <b>riveted</b> nuts are used for the assembling of the interior construction in railway vehicles. Based on the needed class of risk, the load capacity of the preloaded screw connections with <b>blind</b> <b>riveted</b> nuts must be proved in accordance with the technical standards. The assumptions for screw connections underlying these technical standards are partly applicable on the connections with <b>blind</b> <b>riveted</b> nuts. On that account, the following article describes a procedure to generate the necessary proof in an experimental way...|$|R
40|$|A <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> nut is a {{mechanical}} fastener enabling a fast installation from one side. The setting process relies on plastic deformation due to axial compression of the rivet nut {{in such a}} way that a bulge is formed on the underside of the work piece. The mechanical performance of such a connection partly depends on the final geometry of the rivet nut after forming. In this contribution, the torque-to-turn resistance of an internally threaded round tubular rivet is studied with the aid of finite element techniques. A strategy is presented to simulate the setting process involving large plastic strains and contact pressures. An FE-based inverse method was used to identify the local plastic material properties of the <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> nut. The forming simulation was validated in terms of predicted shape of the rivet nut and the evolution of the setting force. A quasi-static FE model using the shape and solution variables of the deformed rivet nut was used to reproduce the torque-to-turn resistance as a function of the setting force. Finally, the aim is to apply the presented modelling strategy to explore innovative possibilities to increase the torque-to-turn resistance of a <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> nut. status: accepte...|$|R
5000|$|While {{structural}} <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> using {{a locked}} mandrel are common, {{there are also}} aircraft applications using [...] "non-structural" [...] <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> where the reduced, but still predictable, strength of the rivet without the mandrel is used as the design strength. A method popularized by Chris Heintz of Zenith Aircraft uses a common flat-head (countersunk) rivet which is drawn into a specially machined nosepiece that forms it into a round head rivet, taking up much of the variation inherent in hole size found in amateur aircraft construction. Aircraft designed with these rivets use rivet strength figures measured with the mandrel removed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Blind</b> <b>rivets,</b> {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "pop" [...] rivets (POP is the brand name of the original manufacturer, now owned by Stanley Engineered Fastening, a division of Stanley Black & Decker) are tubular and are supplied with a mandrel through the center. The rivet assembly is inserted into a hole drilled through the parts to be joined and a specially designed tool is used to draw the mandrel into the rivet. This expands the blind end of the rivet and then the mandrel snaps off. These types of <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> have non-locking mandrels and are sometimes avoided for critical structural joints because the mandrels may fall out, due to vibration or other reasons, leaving a hollow rivet that has a lower load-carrying capability than solid rivets. Furthermore, because of the mandrel they are more prone to failure from corrosion and vibration. Unlike solid rivets, <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> can be inserted and fully installed in a joint from only one side of a part or structure, [...] "blind" [...] to the opposite side.|$|E
50|$|They are {{available}} in flat head, countersunk head, and modified flush head with standard diameters of 1/8, 5/32 and 3/16 inch. <b>Blind</b> <b>rivets</b> are made from soft aluminum alloy, steel (including stainless steel), copper, and Monel.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> has {{strength}} properties {{that can be}} measured in terms of shear and tensile strength.

50|$|One early form of <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> {{that was}} the first to be widely used for {{aircraft}} construction and repair was the Cherry friction-lock rivet.

50|$|Oscar rivets {{are similar}} to <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> in {{appearance}} and installation, but have splits (typically three) along the hollow shaft. These splits cause the shaft to fold and flare out (similar to the wings on a toggle bolt's nut) as the mandrel is drawn into the rivet. This flare (or flange) provides a wide bearing surface that reduces the chance of rivet pull-out. This design is ideal for high vibration applications where the back surface is inaccessible.|$|E
50|$|The RV-12 is {{the first}} {{production}} kit from Vans that is predominantly constructed using <b>blind</b> <b>rivets,</b> which allows {{the majority of the}} construction to be done without an assistant. The use of computerized punch machines to punch out most of the rivet holes to final size simplifies construction by minimizing the need to debur or final size most of the rivet holes. Since the wings are designed to be detached, the majority of the airplane can be constructed in most standard residential garages.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shear test}} {{involves}} installing a rivet into two plates at specified hardness and thickness and measuring the force necessary to shear the plates. The tensile test {{is basically the}} same, except that it measures the pullout strength. Per the IFI-135 standard, all <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> produced must meet this standard.

50|$|A rivet nut, {{also known}} as a <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> nut or {{threaded}} insert, is a one-piece internally threaded and counterbored tubular rivet that can be anchored entirely from one side.

40|$|The {{yield load}} {{equivalent}} for mechanical joints is a characteristic joint value, which appraises the joint specific deformation behavior. The value considers the maximum load {{of a joint}} {{as well as the}} ductility of the joint. Therefore the value is a combined strength / deformation value with high information content. The value guaranties an adequate joint deformation reserve. The shown examples and the application variety prove the adaptability of the yield load equivalent. Those examples as been verified for different fastener types and joint geometries. Based on the appraisal of shear loaded lock bolt and <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> joints the yield load equivalent has been used and proven for the appraisal of: 1. punch rivets / self piercing riveting 2. clinching 3. spot welding 4. tension loaded joints 5. peel loaded joints The appraisal of multiple joint specimens was difficult and is now possible with the yield load equivalent. For this kind of joints the yield load equivalent de liver the possibility to describe the complex joint characteristic with one comparable value. The easy appraisal of the transition area between force and form closure is an additional and important issue for the characterization of load bearing characteristic of mechanical joints. Due to this value a comparability of test result is possible without knowledge of the exact test assembly. Current research projects at the Fraunhofer AGP - Rostock have the goal of implementing the yield load equivalent in national guidelines and standards for dimensioning of <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> and lock bolt joints...|$|R

50|$|Due to this feature, <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> {{are used}} mainly when {{access to the}} joint is {{available}} from only one side. The rivet is placed in a drilled hole and is set by pulling the mandrel head into the rivet body, expanding the rivet body and causing it to flare against the reverse side. As {{the head of the}} mandrel reaches the face of the blind side material, the pulling force is resisted, and at a predetermined force, the mandrel snaps at its break point, also called blind setting. A tight joint formed by the rivet body remains, the head of the mandrel remains encapsulated at the blind side, although variations of this are available, and the mandrel stem is ejected.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of <b>blind</b> <b>rivets,</b> installation of a solid rivet typically required access to both sides of the assembly: a rivet hammer {{on one side and a}} bucking bar on the other side. In 1916, Royal Navy reservist and engineer Hamilton Neil Wylie filed a patent for an [...] "improved means of closing tubular rivets" [...] (granted May 1917). In 1922 Wylie joined the British aircraft manufacturer Armstrong-Whitworth Ltd to advise on metal construction techniques; here he continued to develop his rivet design with a further 1927 patent that incorporated the pull-through mandrel, and allowed the rivet to be used blind. By 1928, the George Tucker Eyelet company produced a [...] "cup" [...] rivet based on the design. It required a separate GKN mandrel and the rivet body to be hand assembled prior to use for the building of the Siskin III aircraft. Together with Armstrong-Whitworth, the Geo. Tucker Co. further modified the rivet design to produce a one-piece unit incorporating mandrel and rivet. This product was later developed in aluminium and trademarked as the [...] "POP" [...] rivet. The United Shoe Machinery Co. produced the design in the U.S. as inventors such as Carl Cherry and Lou Huck experimented with other techniques for expanding solid rivets.|$|E

40|$|For the {{dismantling}} of austenitic components of nuclear facilities fastening techniques, usable remote controlled under water, are investigated. The components are only one-sided accessable. The fastening techniques are based on Drawn Arc Stud Welding, Mechanical Drilling followed by mechanical clamping of the fastening elements and thermal drilling with Contact Arc Metal Cutting (CAMC) followed by mechanical clamping of the fastening elements. In thermal drilling process with CAMC hollow electrodes of different materials with internal water scavenging are investigated with regard to wear behaviour and removal rate. The graphite type EG 88 shows the longest electrode life, tested in plates of thickness from 20 mm up to 65 mm and using dielectric fluid both drinking water and deionized water. 14 holes were drilled in a plate of a thickness of 30 mm (adequate to 420 mm) without electrode-changing, in this time the wear on the length 16, 9 mm. Minor tapered holes and rough interior surfaces of the pearcing holes are the results. Fastening elements plug and <b>blind</b> <b>rivet,</b> which are customary in trade, have been investigated. The latter guarantees the necessary mould clamp. The selected <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> is usable for plate-thicknesses from 6 mm up to 42 mm. In tensile test the rivet pin breaks from 78 kN upwards. The rivet case is formed in minor tapered holes {{in the same way}} as in rough interior surfaces of holes. Drill bur does not influence the results. The developed combined one-way fastening elements and repeatedly applicable fastening elements are able to pierce (CAMC), to interlock and also to fix and to transport the segments of the components without changing end effector of the manipulator.

40|$|The steel {{thin-walled}} {{structures are}} widespread in civil and industrial engineering nowadays. Self-drilling screws or rivets {{are used to}} interconnect thin-walled elements. <b>Blind</b> <b>rivets</b> and nuts as connectors are considered in the frames of this paper. Rivets have some benefits over self-drilling screws. They are: we can obtain more dense connection when using rivets. So we can increase bearing capacity of connection; a lower cost of riveted connection; a large variety of installation tools for riveted connection: manual, pneumatic, battery; side; an easy installation: access to the connected element is required only from one. These benefits provide increasingly growling popularity to rivets. In the paper 4 types of rivets are considered: combined (aluminum/steel) <b>blind</b> <b>rivets,</b> zinc-coated steel <b>blind</b> <b>rivets,</b> stainless steel <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> and blind nuts. The features of each type of rivets are described in the paper. The influence on the behaviour of connections is revealed. The results of experimental research performed by the authors are presented in the paper. A bearing capacity shear of riveted connections is studied in the experiment. There are 3 types of riveted connections subjected to experiment: connection made by blind combined rivets; connection made by zinc-coated steel blind rivets; connection made by blind nuts. A connection between elements with significantly different thicknesses is modeled in the experiment. In reality this situation takes place, for example, in the roofing of buildings, where trapezoidal sheet can be fastened to purlin by rivets. As {{a result of the}} experiment the authors found out that the local deformations occuring under rivet head in the thick element significantly affect the behaviour and bearing capacity of the connection. That’s why the results of connection's bearing capacity obtained in tests were lower than the bearing capacity of rivet declared by manufacturers...|$|E

50|$|A drive rivet {{is a form}} of <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> {{that has}} a short mandrel {{protruding}} from the head that is driven in with a hammer to flare out the end inserted in the hole.

They can also be used with plastic, metal, and other materials and require no special setting tool other than a hammer and possibly a backing block (steel or some other dense material) placed behind the location of the rivet while hammering it into place. Drive rivets have less clamping force than most other rivets. Drive screws, possibly another name for drive rivets, are commonly used to hold nameplates into blind holes. They typically have spiral threads that grip the side of the hole.|$|R
