40|$|WO 2008003373 A 1 UPAB: 20080324 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} reducing intensities of subpixels of matrix {{screen to}} form intensity focuses for subpixel groups behind <b>barrier</b> <b>grids.</b> The focuses are displaced by a constant absolute value continuously through directly adjacent subpixels and through subpixel group boundaries with different stereo image views. The intensity focuses are increasingly widened or compressed relative to screen edges, and {{the intensities of}} the individual subpixels are altered by simple multiplication by standardized constant or variable intensity factors which are ascertained {{as a function of}} motion. USE - Used for an autostereoscopic presentation of image formation on a matrix screen, in an information technology, communication technology, medical technology, computer technology and video technology and also used in public area and private area. ADVANTAGE - The method ensures a fluent, continuous electronic image tracking without perceptible changing effects in the case of physical changes in head position and at a condition for the matrix image with a high image quality with respect to same consistent image resolution, channel crosstalk or another negative effect, thus realizing noise resistant autostereoscopic presentation of image formation in a simple, real time and cost effective manner...|$|R

5000|$|The oldest known {{publication}} {{about using}} a line sheet as a parallax barrier {{to produce an}} autostereogram is found in an article by Auguste Berthier in the French scientific magazine [...] "Le Cosmos" [...] of May 1896. Berthier's idea was hardly noticed, but American inventor Frederic Eugene Ives had more success with his very similar parallax stereogram since 1901. He also patented the technique for a [...] "Changeable sign, picture, &c."

Léon Gaumont introduced Ives' pictures in France and encouraged Eugène Estanave {{to work on the}} technique. Estanave patented a <b>barrier</b> <b>grid</b> technique for animated autostereograms. Animated portrait photographs with line sheets were marketed for a while, mostly in the 1910s and 1920s.

An energy intensive fossil-fuel powered economy makes South Africa {{vulnerable to the}} impact of climate change. South Africa’s commitment to environmentally sustainable energy utilisation, rural electrification needs and energy security is the driving force to venture into renewable energy options. This study investigates the renewable energy options available in South Africa to ascertain which are the most viable to implement. It identifies the obstacles preventing the implementation of renewable energy options and seeks to find solutions to overcome them. This study considered the role of public private partnerships in transforming renewable energy in South Africa through effective public private partnering. A qualitative approach was adopted for this study. Primary data was collected through direct communication in the form of personal ‘face-to-face’ and telephonic interviews and content analysis of documentary materials. This study confirmed that South African conditions were favourable for the implementation {{of a wide range of}} renewable technologies. Legislative <b>barriers,</b> <b>grid</b> access and infrastructure, tariff structures and lack of information were identified as some of the major obstacles delaying the implementation process. Regulatory reform was required to overcome some of these hurdles.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade Grid {{computing}} has matured considerably. A number of groups have built, operated, and expanded large testbed and production Grids. These Grids have inevitably been {{designed to meet the}} needs of a limited set of initial stakeholders, resulting in varying and sometimes ad-hoc specifications. As the use of e-Science becomes more common, this inconsistency is increasingly problematic for the growing set of applications requiring more resources than a single Grid can offer, as spanning these Grid islands is far from trivial. Thus, Grid interoperability is attracting much interest as researchers try to build bridges between separate Grids. Recently we ran a case study that tested interoperation between several Grids, during which we recorded and classified the issues that arose. In this paper we provide empirical evidence supporting existing interoperability efforts, and identify current and potential <b>barriers</b> to <b>Grid</b> interoperability. 1...|$|R

He was probably also {{inspired by the}} <b>barrier</b> <b>grid</b> autostereograms of Frederic Ives and Eugène Estanave, representing Estanave at several presentations of Estanave's works at the French Academy of Sciences. Lippmann suggested to use a screen of tiny lenses. Spherical segments should be pressed {{into a sort of}} film with photographic emulsion on the other side. The screen would be placed inside a lightproof holder and on a tripod for stability. When exposed each tiny lens would function as a camera and record the surroundings from a slightly different angle than neighboring lenses. When developed and lit from behind the lenses should project the life-size image of the recorded subject in space. He could not yet present concrete results in March 1908, {{but by the end of}} 1908 he claimed to have exposed some Integral photography plates and to have seen the [...] "resulting single, full-sized image". However, the technique remained experimental since no material or technique seemed to deliver the optical quality desired. At the time of his death in 1921 Lippmann reportedly had a system with only twelve lenses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Grid computing, being {{a gifted}} way for {{distributed}} supercomputing. There {{are lots of}} challenges for grid computing, both from technical {{point of view and}} from nontechnical point of view and {{there are quite a few}} <b>barriers</b> from <b>grid</b> computing being widely accepted by common end users. Grid computing is taken to the next level which aids in the discovery and use of remote resources for computing and storage. The Grids create an illusion of a simple, large and robust self configuring virtual computer consisting of well connected heterogeneous systems sharing various resources. The users don’t need any direct control over the diverse resources of the Grid. A major difficulty for Grid services is how to gain confidence that a distant system is performing in accordance with their norms. Proper resource distribution and deployment cannot be achieved unless trust is established in the Grid. In this paper we have discussed different challenges and barriers for the improvement and usage of grid computing are listed. Abstract — Grid Computing,Trust,Challenges. I...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper investigates, {{by means}} of a {{numerical}} model, the possibility of using an active noise barrier to virtually reduce the acoustic transparency of a partition wall inside an enclosure. The room is modeled with the image method as a rectangular enclosure with a stationary point source; the active barrier is set up by an array of loudspeakers and error microphones and is meant to minimize the squared sound pressure on a wall {{with the use of a}} decentralized control. Simulations investigate the effects of the enclosure characteristics and of the barrier geometric parameters on the sound pressure attenuation on the controlled partition, on the whole enclosure potential energy and on the diagonal control stability. Performances are analyzed in a frequency range of 25 – 300 Hz at discrete 25 Hz steps. Influencing parameters and their effects on the system performances are identified with a statistical inference procedure. Simulation results have shown that it is possible to averagely reduce the sound pressure on the controlled partition. In the investigated configuration, the surface attenuation and the diagonal control stability are mainly driven by the distance between the loudspeakers and the error microphones and by the loudspeakers directivity; minor effects are due to the distance between the error microphones and the wall, by the wall reflectivity and by the active <b>barrier</b> <b>grid</b> meshing. Room dimensions and source position have negligible effects. Experimental results point out the validity of the model and the efficiency of the barrier in the reduction of the wall acoustic transparency...|$|E

We also note that the size of the region where the magnetic field magnitude is high (> 20 nT) is larger and the proton density near Mars is smaller, compared with the previous work. The reduced proton density, resulting from a stronger magnetic barrier and a stronger bow shock, should result in fewer protons reaching the exobase.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the nano-diode and nano-triode structures of vacuum electronics.

The structures under consideration require to use of low voltages on the gate (grid) electrodes.

40|$|Scientific {{research}} {{communities have}} benefited recently from the increasing availability of computing and data infrastructures with unprecedented capabilities for large scale distributed initiatives. These infrastructures are largely defined and enabled by the middleware they deploy. One {{of the major}} issues in the current usage of research infrastructures {{is the need to}} use similar but often incompatible middleware solutions. The European Middleware Initiative (EMI) is a collaboration of the major European middleware providers ARC, dCache, gLite and UNICORE. EMI aims to: deliver a consolidated set of middleware components for deployment in EGI, PRACE and other Distributed Computing Infrastructures, extend the interoperability between grids and other computing infrastructures, strengthen the reliability of the services, establish a sustainable model to maintain and evolve the middleware, fulfil the requirements of the user communities. This paper presents the consolidation and development objectives of the EMI software stack covering the last two years. The EMI development roadmap is introduced along the four technical areas of compute, data, security and infrastructure. The compute area plan focuses on consolidation of standards and agreements through a unified interface for job submission and management, a common format for accounting, the wide adoption of GLUE schema version 2. 0 and the provision of a common framework for the execution of parallel jobs. The security area is working towards a unified security model and lowering the <b>barriers</b> to <b>Grid</b> usage by allowing users to gain access with their own credentials.

40|$|Pharmacological and lesion data {{indicate}} that acetylcholine {{plays an important role}} in memory formation. Increased levels of acetylcholine in the hippocampal formation are associated with successful encoding while disruption of the cholinergic system leads to impairments on a range of mnemonic tasks. Cholinergic signalling from the medial septum also plays a central role in generating and pacing theta-band oscillations throughout the hippocampal formation. New results suggest a potential link between these distinct phenomena. Environmental novelty, a condition associated with strong cholinergic drive, has been shown to induce an expansion in the firing pattern of entorhinal grid cells and a reduction in the frequency of theta measured from the LFP. Computational modelling suggests the spatial activity of grid cells is produced by interference between neuronal oscillators; scale being determined by theta-band oscillations in entorhinal stellate cells, the frequency of which are modulated by acetylcholine. We propose a causal link: increased cholinergic signalling in response to environmental novelty triggers grid expansion.

40|$|Mozambique and Tanzania are {{countries}} with very low rural electrification (RE) rates as only about 5 % {{of the rural}} population use electricity. Despite efforts to extend the national grid in rural areas, most remote areas will not be reached within the foreseeable future. Off-grid (decentralized) electricity grids {{are seen as a}} complement and forerunner to the national grid, making electricity available many years in advance and creating demand and a customer base. Renewable energy sources are plentiful in the region and may be particularly useful for off-grid systems. The countries' power sectors are undergoing interesting changes with potential to speed up the pace of RE. However, there are significant barriers to effective RE by grid-extension and off-grid installations. In this study, the specific drivers and barriers for RE in Mozambique and Tanzania are explored across a spectrum of involved actors. By qualitative methodology, drivers and barriers were first identified through literature survey, then data was collected both in semi-structured interviews carried out with power sector actors from national to local level and in visits to off-grid electricity users in Tanzania and Mozambique during eight weeks in 2010. Findings illustrate generic, country-specific, and renewable-energy-technology-specific drivers and <b>barriers</b> to <b>grid</b> and off-grid rural electrification, as perceived by different power sector actors. Results were validated and discussed with three external specialists. Drivers and barriers strongly relate to the roles of national and local actors in planning and implementation. The main drivers are political ambitions based on expected growth of demand, but bottom-up drivers such as local initiatives by industries or churches also exist. The barriers are related to lack of access to human capital, to difficulties in planning and donor dependency, to low rural markets and little interest from private sector, and to more straightforward technical matters such as difficulties with installing electric equipment in traditional buildings. Although off-grid systems and renewable energy sources are recognized by the actors, specific barriers to these systems are related to young organizations responsible for implementation and to guilt-by-association with dysfunctional diesel-based off-grid systems...|$|R
40|$|Cyprus is {{an island}} in the Mediterranean Sea. It has an {{isolated}} electricity grid and energy system which is fully reliant on imported fossil fuels. Burning fossil fuels for electricity generation has a negative impact on the environment due to the greenhouse gas emissions and importing the fuels places a huge burden on the economy of the country and a risk in terms of the electricity supply security of the island. One way to reduce dependency on imported fuels is to implement renewable energy solutions in the island. There are many studies assessing the availability of renewable energy sources, evaluating future electricity demand and investigating methods of demand reduction in Cyprus but there are a very limited number of studies specifically produced for Cyprus that address the integration and cost of renewable energy sources and explore their effects on the grid system. This thesis illustrates the big picture of Cyprus in terms of availability of exploitable renewable energy sources, current electricity generation and electricity demand characteristics. In order to address the <b>grid</b> code <b>barrier,</b> the <b>grid</b> codes of developed European countries are investigated. From this research, amendments to the current grid are produced. These additional mandatory codes will form the infrastructure for renewable energy projects and bring knowledge to the current system operator from other experienced countries. In addition renewable energy technologies worldwide are investigated in terms of output capacity, energy pricing, investment, and operation costs. Pricing and cost information is applied to the case of Cyprus. By further optimizing the technologies appropriately to Cyprus conditions, current and future cost analysis is produced. By producing reliable data on the cost and performance of renewable energy technologies the significant barrier to the uptake of these technologies is lowered. This will enable governments and financial bodies to arrive at an accurate assessment of which renewable energy technologies are the most appropriate for their particular circumstances...|$|R
