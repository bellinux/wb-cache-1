5000|$|The Acephala means [...] "no head" [...] as {{the plants}} have leaves with no central head; the {{opposite}} arrangement of white cabbage, or Savoy cabbage. Each cultivar {{has a different}} genome owing to mutation, evolution, the ecological niche, and intentional plant-breeding by man. Mabberley (1997, p. 120) has the Acephala group in three sub-groups: kale, <b>borecole,</b> and collards.|$|E

Mr. Chaundy raised {{a great number of}} mongrels by planting together six distinct varieties of cabbage. These mongrels displayed an infinite diversity of character; [...] "But the most remarkable circumstance was, that, while all the other cabbages and <b>borecoles</b> in the nursery were destroyed by a severe winter, these hybrids were little injured, and supplied the kitchen when there was no other cabbage to be had." ...|$|R

Introduction: Object of Investigation. - The cabbage plant, Brassica oleracea, presents {{us with a}} {{wider range}} of varieties than perhaps any other cultivated plant. There is no other of our garden vegetables which gives so many useful forms as it does. In the wild state it is found on the coasts of western Europe, and persons familiar only with the garden forms would, most likely, not recognize it. Seedlings of the wild plant grown in rich soil show great variations. Selection of these variations has resulted in a number of races, each with numerous varieties. At maturity these races differ very markedly in certain characters. It is not difficult to appreciate the difference between the green and the red cabbage with great single heads; Brussel-sprouts with numerous little heads; broccolis and cauliflowers with the greater number of their flowers in an aborted condition, incapable of producing seed and borne in a dense corymb instead of in an open panicle; Savoys with their blistered and wrinkled leaves; and <b>borecoles</b> and kales which come nearest to the wild parent form. Now the seeds of these races are uniform to a degree. Seen in mass some are a little lighter or darker, some are smaller or larger than usual, but in no case are there any distinguishable markings. As there are no distinguishable features in the seeds, the question we are concerned with is: How soon in the life history of the plants does differentiation begin...|$|R

5000|$|In August 1781, it was {{reported}} in L'ésprit des Journaux, that MM Grœffer et Bessel had been issued a royal patent (dated 30 December 1780) for their preparation of cooked and preserved vegetables for the Royal Navy {{and the use of}} those on sea voyages; it was the first recorded patent for preserving vegetables by drying them. For that purpose, it {{was reported}}, they had purchased 200 arpents of land near the [...] "nouvelle globe", Mile End, for plantings, which appears to be Gordon's long-established plant nursery. The patent was issued for preserving [...] "a vegetable of the Brassica kind, generally known by the name of green and brown <b>borecole,</b> scotch or other kale with a salt solution and drying so it will keep for up to a year." ...|$|E
40|$|Downy mildew {{resistance}} was previously identified from screening a Brassica oleracea collection against two standard UK isolates of Hyaloperonospora parasitica. Sources of resistance were chosen from this material and developed further {{in this study}} by generating doubled haploid (DH) and inbred lines. Seedlings from the new lines were tested for resistance to a larger collection of H. parasitica isolates collected in 2001 - 02 and 2007 - 08 from the main broccoli and cauliflower production regions of the UK. Three lines (derived from <b>borecole</b> or summer cabbage) were broadly resistant to the pathogen isolates. Three of the remaining lines exhibited strong isolate-specific resistance; several examples of weak or basal level of resistance to some isolates were observed. A new H. parasitica variant collected in 2008 was virulent in the broadly resistant lines, but was avirulent in a line with narrow specificity of resistance. The F 2 and BC 1 seedlings derived from outcrossing {{each of the three}} broadly resistant lines to susceptible broccoli and cauliflower lines segregated in a manner indicating that the resistance is controlled by a single dominant gene. No susceptibility was observed amongst F 2 seedlings derived from intercrossing the three resistant lines, indicating that they all share the same or closely linked broad spectrum resistance gene(s). DH lines were produced from F 1 plants and resistant plants were further back-crossed to produce broccoli and cauliflower-like lines that could be useful pre-breeding material. A combination of resistance from lines with broad and narrow specificity is recommended for controlling downy mildew in UK brassica production...|$|E
