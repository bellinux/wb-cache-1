25|$|When Lindsay Hassett {{retired after}} the 1953 Ashes Series his vice-captain Arthur Morris was not {{appointed}} {{to succeed him}} because he was not a state captain. In 1954-55 Australia had not played a Test series since and the selectors were divided as to who should be captain. As with everything else down under cricket was divided between the power centres of Sydney, New South Wales and Melbourne, Victoria. The fast bowling all-rounder Keith Miller was captain of New South Wales and the winner of the 1954-55 Sheffield Shield. He had the obvious advantage of being an automatic selection for the Australian team, and was a charismatic and inspirational leader on the field. Against him was his cavalier approach to the game and that he was little inclined to enforce discipline. His rival was the captain of Victoria, the off-spinner Ian Johnson. Johnson had been little used on the 1948 tour and was left behind in 1953 and was not an automatic selection for the Test team. However, {{he was the son of}} the Test selector William Johnson, had attended the elite Wesley College. Lindsay Hassett and the chairman of selectors Don Bradman favoured Johnson and he was appointed captain by the A.C.B.. Unlike Miller he was seen as a safe pair of hands and he was an astute captain and a fine ambassador for Australian cricket, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>everybody</b> was happy with the choice. Frank Tyson reckoned that his innings victory in the First Test cost Australia the series as it confirmed Johnson in the captaincy, whereas Miller might have won the next three vital Tests. As it was vice-captain Arthur Morris was blamed for the defeat in Sydney and (strangely) Melbourne and the selectors stuck by Johnson. He went on to captain the successful Australian tour of the West Indies in 1954-55, where his diplomacy ensured that he did not suffer the same problems as Len Hutton in 1953-54, and his captaincy was considered to be equal to that of Richie Benaud. He retired after the Australian tour of England, Pakistan and India in 1956, where he again failed to regain the Ashes after being 1-0 up in the series.|$|E

40|$|Research has {{repeatedly}} shown that neighbourhood disadvantage negatively influences individual educational outcomes. However, the great variation in outcomes indicates substantial unobserved heterogeneity. Looking at {{the rates of}} obtaining a basic educational qualification, the hypothesis is that individual traits of adolescents can buffer neighbourhood effects. First, adolescents with a more resilient personality may {{be better able to}} cope with neighbourhood adversity. And second, educational commitments might buffer adolescents from negative neighbourhood influences. These hypotheses are tested employing survival analysis, using six wave panel data, containing information on ten years of adolescents' lives. The results show that resilients experience no negative influence of neighbourhood disadvantage, while both undercontrollers and overcontrollers do. And, the stronger adolescents' educational commitments, the less they experience the negative effect of neighbourhood adversity.

An exhaustive survey of his works is out of the question, nor would any one be repaid for the labour of criticism. A mere list of the topics that he handled would fill a long chapter. A redaction of a long treatise on harmony, a vast sheaf of notes on the elements of physiology, a collection of miscellanea on the drama, a still more copious collection of miscellanea on a hundred points in literature and art, a fragment on the exercise of young Russians, an elaborate plan of studies for a proposed Russian University,--no less panurgic and less encyclopædic a critic than Diderot himself could undertake to sweep with ever so light a wing over this vast area.

40|$|Daniel Hamermesh has {{undertaken}} an extensive survey {{of what we}} know about the impact of income maintenance programs on employment, unemployment and labor force participation. Reflected in this paper is an awesome amount of research, both that of others and his own. And, on balance, he has done an excellent job of synthesizing this literature. He is, certainly, the resident expert in this area among us. If this conference is a supplyside harvest, we may note that Hamermesh has been busy tilling the fields, and gathering the crops. However, there are problems. The first problem Hamermesh has is where to look for evidence of supply-side effects. He starts by looking at macro time series data, regressing log U * (where U* l 00 ~U* is the unemployment rate adjusted for shifts in demographic composition) on lagged values of two policy variables: (1) NRR—net replacement rate of aggregate transfers payments; (2) TAX—the overall tax rate on earnings. Unfortunately the results seem not to be to his liking, though they would warm the heart of a Lafferite. A one standard deviation increase in NRR from its mean raises U * from 5 % to 7. 85 %, and a similar increase in tax raises U * from 5 % to 6. 19 %. Flamermesh then decides that truth may only be revealed by an examination of the effect of individual programs. <b>But</b> <b>not</b> <b>everybody’s</b> examination. For instance, the 1973 study of benefits by Feldstein, which finds that Unemployment Insurance benefits and taxes have raised NAIRU by 1. 25 percentage points, and a 1977 study by Clarkson and Meiners, which finds that AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) plus Food Stamps have raised the measured unemployment rate by 2 percentage points, are rejected as patently too large. Finally Hamermesh hits upon a solution. He takes the Perlof...|$|R
