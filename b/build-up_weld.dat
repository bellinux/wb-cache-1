Aerosol emission rates were found to range from 0. 1 mg/s up to 1. 4 mg/s, which is much lower than aerosol emission in arc <b>build-up</b> <b>welding.</b> Emission rates of gaseous substances (NO, NO_x, ozone) are three order of magnitude lower than those of aerosols and can be regarded as uncritical. Aerosol particle composition and particle size distribution have been measured and related to process parameters. The majority of the emissions is known to be allergizing, toxic and carcinogenic.

40|$|Laser beam <b>build-up</b> <b>welding</b> gains {{increasing}} {{importance for}} the production of high-performance coatings for applications in surface treatment and remanufacturing. However, the cladding rate is low and the specific running costs are comparatively high, so that potential laser applications remain undeveloped first of all for economical reasons. Against this background, innovative developments aim at combining laser <b>build-up</b> <b>welding</b> and efficient spraying, welding, and heat treating techniques. For large area claddings, laser assisted plasma spraying guarantees as a one-step coating process high deposition rates, completely dense coatings and a strong, metallurgical bonding to the substrate. Furthermore, the sequential combination of laser and plasma build up welding (PTA) is a promising variant {{for the production of}} precision parts. Here, the laser beam generates the outer contours of filigree and complex shape, and the plasma gun fills efficiently the inner volume. Finally, the combinat ion of laser cladding and simultaneous induction heating is a solution for the production of up to 65 HRC hard and crack-free metal coatings or composite claddings containing up to 75 % carbide particles. The welding speed reaches up to 10 m/min. Examples of application are ceramic coatings on turbine blades, nickel-base coatings on metal forming tools, and repaired tools and molds...|$|R

The laser <b>build-up</b> <b>welding</b> process especially {{is now a}} standard technology where cost efficient, precisely localized and near net shape repair welds are required. The concept of integrating the modular laser components into standard machine tools makes the technology easily accessible to the user and very efficiently combines <b>build-up</b> <b>welding</b> and metal-cutting processes. Design/methodology/approach Specially designed laser system technology is available as add-on kits for different machine tools of the end-users. They can choose from a large variety of laser sources, manufacturing heads, welding material supply as well as process control devices. User-friendly software guides through the entire process chain. So, optimized laser systems for different cladding and build-up applications can be installed easily and inexpensively in common turning and milling machines.

This study {{addresses}} the fatigue {{life of the}} headâtoâskirt welds of tall distillation columns. Fatigue tests were done on two types of weld geometries which approximate the headâtoskirt configurations. From the fatigue tests {{it was determined that}} the fatigue life of the experimental samples can be substantially improved by applying <b>weld</b> <b>buildâup</b> between the head and the skirt. The expected fatigue life of the test samples was determined by way of calculation employing the so called NominalâStressâApproach, the EffectiveâNotchâStressâApproach and the StressâLifeâApproach. For both the NominalâStressâApproach and the EffectiveâNotchâStressâApproach the predicted fatigue life was found to be overly conservative compared to the experimental results. The StressâLifeâApproach predicted the fatigue life to within a factor of 1. 3 for both the geometries under investigation when displacements due to welding are taken into account. If displacements due to welding is omitted this factor is increased, for the geometry without <b>weld</b> <b>buildâup,</b> to 2.

40|$|Integrally bladed rotor disks {{are used}} to an {{increasing}} extent in low-pressure compressors (LPC) and highpressure compressors (HPC) of aero engines. These bladed disks {{are referred to as}} blisks. One of the objectives pursued under the EU sponsored AWFORS project is to test laser cladding for its suitability to restore damaged blades of titanium blisks. This paper describes details of the laser cladding process to manufacture conventional and blade-like specimens in the titanium alloy Ti 6242 and the characterization of <b>build-up</b> <b>welds</b> by evaluation of their microstructure, hardness survey and residual stress measurements. The crucial point with regard to the application of laser cladding to replace damaged titanium blisks blades is the verification that the strength properties are not reduced. For this reason, another focus of this paper is on mechanical testing of laser clad specimens of Ti 6242. Tensile and fatigue tests on conventional and blade-like specimens were performed. Both the tensile strength and the fatigue strength of laser clad specimens exceed the corresponding strength values of Ti 6242 base material. Altogether the results show that laser cladding is a highly promising technology to restore damaged blades of titanium blisks...|$|R
40|$|The {{repair and}} quick {{geometrical}} changes of components and tools are currently {{the most important}} applications of laser <b>build-up</b> <b>welding.</b> Advanced laser technology permits {{the integration of the}} main process steps into one machining center for a very efficient and flexible manufacturing process. The solution presented in this paper consists of a 3 axes CNC milling machine, in which a 3 kW Nd:YAG laser, a coaxial powder nozzle, and a digitizing system are integrated. All functions (data processing, laser process, powder feeding, and milling) are controlled by one CNC controller using specially developed software. In the first step the workpiece needs to be adjusted to the machine table. Then the contour of the damaged surface is determined by either an optical or mechanical digitizing system. Using the resulting data, a software system generates automatically the laser build-up strategy and the CNC programs for the laser and the milling processes. After laser freeforming, a raw piece with an oversize of 0. 3 to 0. 6 mm is made. From this geometry the end contour is milled with an accuracy of some 10 microns.

40|$|The quick {{manufacturing}} {{of large}} metal forming tools, e. g. for car body parts, {{is a novel}} and promising application of the Metal-LOM technique.

In the solution presented in horizontal or vertical layers by a specially developed software. Subsequently, steel sheets with a typical thickness of around 1 mm are cut according to these slices, stacked, and joined to a package.

40|$|Laser beam <b>build-up</b> <b>welding</b> {{belongs to}} the {{technical}} group of thermal coating. With a coating thickness between 0. 1 and 3 mm it is positioned close to PTA and TIG cladding. The special features consist in the excellent controllability of the cladding process, high precision of the material deposition, low thermal influence on the workpiece and low base material deposition, low thermal influence on the workpiece and low base material mixing, the absence of mechanical effects on the melt pool {{as well as the}} large number of coating and substrate materials available for the manufacturing process. Currently, the most important application is the repair of complex shaped and expensive components and tools.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study the effect of Post Weld Heat Treatment on the micostructural and {{strength}} properties of high chromium steel [AISI 410] components. This work also aims to estimate the magnitude and distribution of the residual stress on the above type of welded components. In introducing this work an extensive literature survey on the historical development and {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of welding process has been presented. A review of the different technique which are used to determine the residual stress is also presented. In this work two types of Post Weld Heat Treatment were used. in the first type of heat treatment, the specimen was kept at 316 Â°C for 30 min, then at 427 Â°C for 30 min, and finally, at 546 Â®C for 2 hrs. In the second type of heat treatment the specimen was kept at 760 Â°C for 2 hrs. Two types of specimens were used to simulate <b>build-up</b> <b>welding</b> and crack repair conditions, each type of these specimens have different parameters (thickness, bead length and width). Stress relaxation technique was used to detemine the magnitude and distribution of the residual stresses for the above specimens. The results show that the first type of heat treatment reduces the hardness in the welding zone by about 15 % of the hardness of the as welded specimen and improves the tensile strength. The second type of heat treatment decreases the hardness in the welding zone by about 40 % but decreases the tensile strength by about 10 %. The residual stress measurements show that there is a tensile stress around the welded zone, and that the greatest value recorded is about 72 N/mm*. These residual stresses decrease as the distance from the welding zone increases...|$|R
40|$|Allseas Engineering bv is an {{engineering}} {{center of the}} Allseas group, {{a major player in}} the offshore pipe lay market and recently expanding the activities to the offshore heavy lift sector. Because of the necessity to design and build lifting structures and equipment of a tremendously high capacity, the demand for high-strength steels usage has been arisen. These steels are to be welded and used in a harsh offshore environment. Localized heating and melting of a workpiece during welding lead to the build-up of residual stresses. When distortion is prevented due to constraints in structures or due to clamping, stress levels will be high and may exceed the yield strength. Post weld treatments are often carried out to mitigate or re-distribute the residual stresses. Ultrasonic impact techniques make use of the combined effects of the high frequency impacts and ultrasonic oscillations in the treated material. Ultrasonic impact treatment (UIT) has been applied successfully to increase the fatigue life of parts and welded elements, to eliminate distortion caused by welding and other technological processes, to relieve residual stresses, and to increase the hardness of materials. Although reported results on fatigue life are very promising, the detailed changes induced in the treated material and the mechanisms by which such changes occur are still poorly understood. In this research, the main objectives are to understand the stress <b>build-up</b> during multi-pass <b>welding,</b> and the mechanisms involved in post weld ultrasonic impact treatments, how these affect the residual stress state in the welded area.

40|$|Abstract This thesis studies {{controlling}} {{factors that}} govern transverse hydrogen cracking in high-strength multipass weld metal (WM). The experiments {{were concerned with}} heavy-restraint Y- and U-Groove multipass cracking tests of shielded-metal arc (SMAW) and submerged-arc (SAW) weld metals. Results of tensile tests, hardness surveys, weld residual stress measurements and microstructural investigations are discussed. The analytical phase comprised numerical calculations for analysing the interactions between crack-controlling factors. The objectives were: (i) the assessment of WM hydrogen cracking risk by defining the Crack-No Crack boundary conditions in terms of 'safe line' description giving the desired lower-bound estimates, and (ii) to derive predictive equations capable of giving reliable estimates of the required preheat/interpass temperature T 0 /Ti for the avoidance of cracking. Hydrogen cracking occurred predominantly in high strength weld metals of Rp 0. 2 â 580 - 900 MPa. At intermediate strengths of Rp 0. 2 â 500 - 550 MPa, cracking {{took place in the}} cases where the holding time from welding to NDT inspection was prolonged to 7 days. Low strength WMs of Rp 0. 2 â¤ 480 MPa did not exhibit cracking under any conditions examined. Cracking occurrence was, above all, governed by WM tensile strength, weld diffusible hydrogen and weld residual stresses amounting to the yield strength. The appearance of cracking vanished when transferring from 40 to 6 mm thick welds. The implications of the holding time were more significant than anticipated previously. A period of 16 hrs in accordance with SFS-EN 1011 appeared much too short for thick multipass welds. Interpass time and heat input showed no measurable effect on cracking sensitivity, hence being of secondary importance. Equations were derived to assess the weld critical hydrogen content Hcr corresponding to the Crack-No Crack conditions as a function of either weld metal Pcm, yield strength Rp 0. 2 or weld metal maximum hardness HV 5 (max). For the calculation of safe T 0 /Ti estimates, a formula incorporating: (i) WM strength as a linear function of either weld carbon equivalent CET or weld HV 5 (max), (ii) <b>weld</b> <b>build-up</b> thickness aw in the form of tanh expression and (iii) weld diffusible hydrogen HD in terms of a combined [ln / power law] expression was found descriptive...|$|R
