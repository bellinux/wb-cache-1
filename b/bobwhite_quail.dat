500|$|Some animals, {{previously}} {{present in}} abundance, have disappeared, or the populations declined, through habitat loss. By 1912, after the forests had been clearcut, Quehanna {{was covered by}} [...] "vast expanses of brush, created when the root systems of cut-off trees sprouted up through the discarded tops and limbs of the logged forest". Once the forest fires were controlled, this brush offered habitat for many game species. By the early 1940s, the CCC had thinned brush in many areas, and the forest had matured. Shade from the canopy decreased brush in the understory. By the early 21st century, many of the trees in Quehanna were 80 to 100 years old, and the maturation of the forests led to the disappearance of species like <b>bobwhite</b> <b>quail,</b> ring-necked pheasant, and snowshoe hare; white-tailed deer, ruffed grouse, black squirrel, and cottontail rabbit all became less common. Efforts by the Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association (MCSA) to reintroduce <b>bobwhite</b> <b>quail,</b> ring-necked pheasant, and snowshoe hare have been unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|Susan Stranahan's Susquehanna: River of Dreams {{reports that}} before Curtiss-Wright {{took over the}} area in 1955, Quehanna was {{considered}} [...] "some of the best hunting land in the state". No hunting or fishing were initially allowed on the leased land, but by July 1959 fishing on Mosquito Creek was allowed again, as was limited hunting to help control the deer. In October 1963 hunting resumed throughout the wild area, four years before the state purchased the land back from Curtiss-Wright. As of 2010, the Pennsylvania Game Commission allowed hunting of the following species found in Quehanna Wild Area: American crow, beaver, black bear, black squirrel, bobcat, <b>bobwhite</b> <b>quail,</b> cottontail rabbit, coyote, elk, house sparrow, raccoon, red fox, ring-necked pheasant, ruffed grouse, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and woodcock. The Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association has sponsored an annual coyote hunt each winter hunt since 1992. The club has also provided food plots for deer and elk, fed game animals in winter, planted and pruned fruit trees, stocked fish, and treated streams for acid rain.

40|$|Abstract: Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) {{populations have}} {{declined}} {{throughout most of}} their distribution, and these declines have become more dramatic in recent years. In this review, we examine the role of predation in quail management. Predation is {{the major source of}} nest loss and of mortality for young and adult quail. Mean nest success across studies reviewed was 28 %. Mammalian predators most often implicated in nest predation include striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), raccoons (Procyon lotor), opossums (Didelphis virginianus), foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus and Vulpes vulpes), coyotes (Canis latrans), and feral hogs (Sus scrofa). Accipiters (Accipiter spp.) and northern harriers (Circus cyaneus) are the most common avian predators of quail. Less information is available for assessing the impact of predation on scaled quail, but observations from areas where <b>bobwhites</b> and scaled <b>quail</b> are sympatric suggested that scaled quail are less vulnerable to predation than <b>bobwhites.</b> Although <b>quail</b> have adaptations for coping with high predation rates (e. g., renesting, large clutches), populations in some areas may be suppressed by predation. Changes in land use, management practices, and predator communities interact to depress quail populations over much of the bobwhiteâ€™s range. Because of their relatively small size, {{and the fact that they}} spend their entire lives on the ground, various species of quail are extremely vulnerable to predation. However, prevailing paradigms in quail management suggest that predators are rarely a management concern, and that predation should be managed only indirectly (i. e., habitat management) (Errington 1934). Rollins and Carroll (2001) reviewed the evidence relative to the impacts of predation on northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter <b>bobwhite)</b> and scaled <b>quail</b> (Callipepla squamata) as models for North American species. This paper is an abridged summary of that review...|$|R

40|$|Lipids are {{believed}} to be the major fuel used during non-stop flights in migrant bird species, and potential mechanisms that enhance the capacity for fatty acid utilization have been identified in migrant birds. One of these adjustments is the use of dietary lipids, such as n- 3 eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), as performance-enhancing substances. Recently, these fatty acids have been found to improve the oxidative capacity of wild semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) just prior to their migration to South America, by increasing the activity of the Krebs cycle and beta-oxidation enzymes. However, these experiments were conducted in a "natural context" and consequently it is impossible to control for a number of confounding variables (such as seasonal migration effects) that could also affect oxidative enzymes independent of diet. Therefore, this thesis aimed to investigate the effects of the diet on Krebs cycle and beta-oxidation enzymes using captive <b>bobwhite</b> <b>quails</b> (Colinus virginianus) as a model, while also attempting to elucidate the potential mechanisms of action. My goal was to characterize the roles of EPA and DHA in stimulating oxidative capacity, either through changes in membrane composition or through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Birds received the following dietary treatments for 6 weeks: EPA, DHA or EPA+DHA. Following the experimental treatments, the activity of several enzymes was measured in quail flight muscles including Krebs cycle enzymes such as citrate synthase and cytochrome oxydase (respectively CS, COX); and markers for beta-oxidation such as carnitine palmitoyl transferase and 3 -hydroxyacyl dehydrogenase (respectively CPT and HOAD), as well as the expression of PPAR genes. Results reveal that dietary n- 3 fatty acids stimulated the activity of oxidative enzymes by 58 - 90 %; surprisingly increases such as these are found only in extreme regimes of endurance training. Moreover, sedentary quails showed the same changes in membrane composition as refueling sandpipers. EPA and DHA have shown similar doping effects, possibly because the two fatty acids are easily interconverted. The substitution of n- 6 arachidonic acid (ARA) by dietary n- 3 fatty acids in membrane phospholipids {{plays an important role in}} mediating the metabolic effects of the diet, but results provide no significant support for the involvement of PPARs (as determined by changes in gene expression). This study also demonstrates that modifications in fatty acid composition of mitochondrial and sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes can be assessed by monitoring total muscle phospholipids, because all phospholipids are equally affected by diet. Overall the dietary n- 3 fatty acids stimulate the capacity for aerobic metabolism in quail flight muscles, thereby mimicking the natural doping effects previously reported in wild sandpipers. However, the absence of associations between the activity of some enzymes and membrane composition is strong evidence that PPARs could be involved in the stimulation of oxidative capacity...|$|R
40|$|The rearing of grouse and quail for enjoyment, profit, or {{stocking}} in {{the wild}} {{has been an important}} aspect of grouse and quail biology. The very presence of chukar and gray partridges in North America, the occurrence of ruffed grouse in Newfoundland and Nevada, the presence of <b>bobwhites,</b> scaled <b>quail,</b> and California quail in Washington, and many other examples are ample testimony to the potential value of careful propagation and release programs. Between 1938 and 1968 a total of 110, 663 bobwhites, 18, 136 other native quails, 7, 977 grouse, and 50, 568 chukar partridges were released under Pittman-Robertson programs in the United States (based on a recent summary provided by the Bureau of Sports Fisheries and Wildlife). An additional but unspecified number of gray partridges was also part of the release program. Yeatter (1935) estimated that more than 260, 000 of these birds had been released in North America by the 1930 s. The problems of keeping and breeding grouse in captivity are distinctly different from and much greater than those of propagating quails and partridges, and as a result relatively few persons have succeeded in keeping and breeding grouse in large numbers or with consistent success. This is largely a reflection of the greater sensitivity of grouse to various poultry diseases and parasites that are transmitted by ground contact, forcing the game breeder to keep the birds on wire-bottom cages where they can have no direct contact with the ground or their own droppings. A summary of the diseases and parasites of grouse and quails has been provided by Bump et al. (1947) and Stoddard (1931), respectively, although the treatments recommended have been greatly modified in more recent years...|$|R

40|$|Providing {{supplemental}} feed is {{a popular}} management practice for <b>quail</b> (northern <b>bobwhite</b> Colinus virginianus and scaled quail Callipepla squamata) in Texas. It is common knowledge that non-target species, e. g., raccoons (Procyon lotor), are frequent visitors at feeding stations intended for quail. However, empirical data are scarce on seasonal visitation rates at such feeders, either by quail or by non-target species. The ecological efficacy and economic efficiency of a feeding program for quail depends on several variables; {{perhaps the most important}} of these is how much of the feed is consumed by quail versus various non-target species. I monitored species visitation seasonally at free-choice quail feeders with motion-sensing cameras at 4 sites in West Texas (Coke, Fisher and Stonewall counties). Quail feeders were monitored using active-infrared sensing camera systems and passive-infrared video systems, to compare data obtained via these 2 surveillance techniques. I tested 2 research hypotheses: 1) that quail feeders are visited by a wide range of non-target species; and 2) active-infrared surveillance will yield a more precise estimate of species visitation than estimates derived from passive video surveillance. Major findings included documentation of approximately 14 mammalian and 18 avian species that were recorded in a total of 6, 558 events. Data analysis yielded a chronology of feeding behavior by all visiting species. I found that species visitation at quail feeders varied according to season, with the greatest number of events occurring during the fall and the fewest during the winter. Feeder visitation also varied according to lunar phase, with the fewest events occurring during the new moon phase. I recorded the duration of each event monitored on videotape, a total of 29, 235 minutes, and determined that feeder visitation by raccoons comprised 43. 2 % of all time spent at quail feeders across all species. Visitation by <b>bobwhite</b> and scaled <b>quail</b> comprised only 5. 4 % of time spent at quail feeders by all visiting species. This study confirmed the need for strategy implementation that minimizes non-target consumption of feed intended for quail...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 For my {{research}} goals I addressed the theoretical importance {{of competition in}} habitat selection of 2 quails and examined the use of resources in peripheral and core areas. Methodological objectives were to determine cover and food selection of Texas bobwhite (Colinus virginianus texanus) and chestnut-bellied scaled quail (Callipepla squamata castanogastris) in southern Texas. The Welder Refuge was the core area for bobwhites. The Chaparrosa and Experiment Ranches were peripheral areas for both quails. The core population for scaled quail was located at the Killam Ranch. Available cover formed a gradient from Welder to Killam. The highest percentage of herbaceous material was on Welder, whereas the largest amount of bare ground and shrub cover was at Killam. <b>Bobwhites</b> and scaled <b>quail</b> used and preferred different cover types. Bobwhites selected dense herbaceous material, whereas scaled quail preferred sparse vegetation and a shrub overstory. Based on niche breadth estimates, both quails used a narrow range of cover types in their respective core areas and a broad range in the peripheral areas. The frequency of available food items also formed a gradient. Welder had the largest percent frequency of animal matter and of herbaceous seeds and green leaves. Killam had the highest frequency of seeds, leaves, and fleshy fruits from woody plants. Bobwhites preferred grass seeds and animal matter, whereas scaled quail selected the fruits and seeds of woody plants. Niche breadth estimates were relatively constant for each quail. Theoretically, when intraspecific competition is most intense a species selects {{a broad range of}} habitats, whereas sympatric species occupy a narrow range of resources due to interspecific competition. However, when I used niche breadth estimates to address my first goal, neither component of the habitat (cover or food) followed the anticipated pattern. Therefore, I believe competition is not the major selective force in habitat selection of quails. The generalization has been put forth that in the peripheral part of a range birds occupy their optimal habitat, whereas {{at the center of the}} range, optimal and suboptimal habitats are used. However, the core area contains an abundance of preferred habitat and a species is able to meet its life-history requirements within a narrow range of cover types. Peripheral areas supply only suboptimal habitat and in order to fulfill the species-specific needs a species must use a wide range of cover types...|$|R
