Nonionic detergents are produced by alkylation of phenol to give the alkylphenols, e.g., nonylphenol, which are then subjected to ethoxylation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bisphenol-A</b> (BPA) is a toxic {{chemical}} compound present in commercially available tin can plastic linings {{and transferred to}} canned food.
