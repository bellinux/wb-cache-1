25|$|In 1835, German theologian David Friedrich Strauss {{published}} his extremely controversial The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined (Das Leben Jesu). While not denying that Jesus existed, he did {{argue that the}} miracles in the New Testament were mythical retellings of normal events as supernatural happenings. According to Strauss, the early church developed these miracle stories to present Jesus as a fulfillment of Jewish prophecies of what the Messiah would <b>be</b> <b>like.</b> <b>This</b> rationalist perspective was in direct opposition to the supernaturalist view that the bible was accurate both historically and spiritually.|$|E

500|$|... "Bad for Good" [...] {{was one of}} {{the many}} songs written by Steinman under the {{inspiration}} of Peter Pan and lost boys who never grow up. This is reflected in lyrics such as [...] "You know I'm gonna <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> forever/I'm never gonna be what I should." [...] The song was written to appear on the follow-up to Bat Out of Hell, but which Steinman recorded himself.

500|$|Fenriz, drummer of Darkthrone, {{included}} a Sarcófago track ("Satanic Lust") in his The Best of Old-School Black Metal compilation, released by Peaceville Records.

Euronymous, the deceased guitarist of Mayhem and erstwhile leader of the so-called [...] "Inner Circle", traded correspondence with Lamounier {{in the early days of}} Norway's scene. In the Lords of Chaos book, Metalion (Slayer fanzine, ex-Head Not Found) stated that Euronymous was [...] "obsessed with them because wore lots of spikes and corpsepaint.

500|$|The episode has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics. Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times remarked, [...] "Great acting, a decent twist {{and the truth}} {{behind one of the}} most enigmatic characters in television history. Why can’t more Fringe episodes <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> Why can’t more television be like Fringe?'". Hanson also lauded Jared Harris' performance, calling him [...] "a fantastic villain. Arrogant and superior, with hints of insecurity. Jones’ speech about all living creatures needing incentive might have been goofy coming from any other actor, but from Harris, it is creepy beyond belief. So glad Fringe found a way to bring David Robert Jones back." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler rated it 9.0/10 for being a [...] "fast-paced story" [...] that was [...] "the best episode of the season so far". He continued [...] "Olivia's great escape from Jones and Bad Nina was fantastic television and some clever writing." [...] Isler did find some of the Observer revelations [...] "a bit of a let-down" [...] however, as he felt he had already been made aware of them; this was not enough to make him critical of the episode.|$|E

In a 2005 interview at her college alma mater, Goldberg explained her motivation: [...] "I'll tell you how I wrote the book. I did write it very consciously to get darker and stronger as it continues. I wanted it at first to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> sunny, happy, Reader's Digest kind of read, and to lull people into this sense of complacency and then hit them over the head." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his text}} Buddho Ajahn Thate {{describes}} {{what it is}} like when the mind has finally rid itself of preoccupation with sensual distractions and is able to focus on the breath, mantra, or a part of the body, in meditation: [...] "When you first enter concentration, this is what it's like: [...] You'll have no idea at all of what concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going to feel like. You are simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object – and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object is what will bring you to a state of concentration. You won't be thinking at all that concentration will <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> or like that, or that you want it to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> or like that. It will simply take its own way, automatically. No one can force it. At that moment you will feel as if you are in another world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and solitude to which nothing else in the world can compare. When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and you will remember it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. You have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't try to remember your past states of concentration, and don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you will just be making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|E

Six years later, Rucker signed to Capitol Nashville as a country music singer, releasing the album, Learn to Live that year. Its first single, [...] "Don't Think I Don't Think About It", made him the first black artist to reach {{number one on the}} Hot Country Songs charts since Charley Pride in 1983.

It was followed by two more number one singles, [...] "It Won't <b>Be</b> <b>Like</b> <b>This</b> for Long" [...] and [...] "Alright" [...] and the number three, [...] "History in the Making."
