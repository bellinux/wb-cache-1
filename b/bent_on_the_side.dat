40|$|Introduction: Spontaneous {{pulmonary}} torsion is {{an extremely}} rare event and is known to occur as a complication of thoracic surgery and traumatic injuries. Presentation of case: An 18 -year-old man presented to our hospital with pain in the left back region. Clinical examination, computed tomography and bronchoscopy are crucial for diagnosis of pulmonary torsion. During thoracotomy, the lingula segment was observed to be <b>bent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head <b>side</b> and turned 180 ° counterclockwise; subsequently, lingulectomy was performed. Discussion: Spontaneous pulmonary torsion may occur in pulmonary conditions such as pneumothorax, atelectasis, infection, pleural effusion, congenital defect, or tumor. Furthermore, it can be speculated that torsion of the segment is possible only in the patients with an accessory fissure or those who have undergone a segmentectomy. Conclusion: We have reported an extremely rare case {{with respect to the}} fact that the pulmonary torsion occurred spontaneously in an unseparated segment, and that the etiological factor could not be identified...|$|R

One of his Spies, reporting from Prince Karl's quarters, Friedrich has at this time discovered to be a Double-Spy, reporting thither as well. Double-Spy, there is an ugly fact;--perhaps not quite convenient to abolish it by hemp and gibbet; perhaps it could be turned to use, as most facts can? [...] "Very good, my expert Herr von Schonfeld [that was the knave's name]; and now of all things, whenever the Prince does get across,--instant word to us of that! Nothing so important to us. If he should get BETWEEN us and Breslau, for example, what would the consequence be!" [...] To this purport Friedrich instructs his Double-Spy; sends him off, unhanged, to Prince Karl's Camp, to blab this fresh bit of knowledge. [...] "We likewise," [...] says Friedrich, [...] "ordered some repairs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roads leading to Breslau;"--last turn of the hand to our bit of toasted fragrancy. And Prince Karl is actually striding forward, at an eager pace:--and Nadasti VERSUS Winterfeld, the other day, could Winterfeld have guessed it, was the actual vanguard of the march; and will be up again straightway!

50|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> {{morning of}} August 6, Shinji shows his Father a wooden boat Gen made for him, and tells his Father that Gen {{promised to take}} him to the river to set it afloat after he returns from school. Gen leaves his home around 7:40 in the morning. Upon {{reaching}} his school at approximately 8:15, Gen and a female friend take notice of a single B-29 aircraft flying far overhead. Like other Hiroshima residents, they are not concerned, since they decide that a single aircraft cannot possibly pose any kind of threat. As this occurs, his father, sister, and brother watch and discuss as an army of ants enters their home in large numbers, while his mother hangs clothes on a clothesline on a second-floor balcony of the house. Gen, who is tossing a pebble up and down, drops it and bends over to pick it up. Suddenly, there is a blinding flash of white light, which horribly burns Gen's friend and the eyes of nearby people begin to melt as their skin burns away. Gen's father, sister and brother are buried by their collapsing home, and Gen's mother falls from the balcony. Gen is protected from the flash because he was <b>bent</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other <b>side</b> of a stone wall, but is blown back by the shock wave, and is buried under some rubble. Several explicit and dramatic scenes throughout Hiroshima show the effects of the explosion, as buildings are destroyed and people are literally evaporated.|$|R
50|$|It is {{four stories}} in height, built of light colored brick, terra cotta and brownstone. <b>The</b> front <b>on</b> Schermerhorn street is ninety feet in width. The {{basement}} is built of rough hewn brownstone. A flight of stone steps, converging towards the top, {{leads to a}} wide arched doorway, supported by four finely carved pillars of red sandstone, with Corinthian foliage and floral designs in terra cotta. To {{the right of the}} entrance the building is flanked by a huge circular tower, rising from the basement to a point just above the fourth story, where it terminates in a conical roof. There are four rows of arched and mullioned windows in the tower, with panes of <b>bent</b> glass. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> opposite <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> building, {{between the first and second}} stories, a wide bay window projects outward for some distance, its roof forming a balcony of considerable dimensions, enclosed by rails of dark brownstone. The features of this window are two panes of bent glass, eight by ten feet in size, which are said to be the largest of their kind in the country. Above the arch of the doorway four pilasters, faced with terra cotta flower and basket work, and capped with elaborately carved brownstone copings, extend to the height of the building, terminating at either corner of the gable. At every suitable space <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front of the club house there is an abundance of delicated carvings and moulding, while each of the windows is supported on sheaves of slender columns, crowned with richly foliated capitals.|$|R
60|$|We find this, for instance, {{in one of}} {{the very}} first and {{perhaps one of the most}} picturesque of all the facts that are {{recorded}} or reported of him. As a youth, tall, very shy and quiet, he was only notable for intellectual interests of the soberest and most methodical sort, especially for the close study of mathematics. This also, incidentally, was typical enough, for his work in Egypt and the Soudan, by which his fame was established, was based wholly upon such calculations. It was not merely mathematical but literally geometrical. His work bore the same relation to Gordon's that a rigid mathematical diagram bears to a rough pencil sketch on which it is based. Yet <b>the</b> student thus <b>bent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> strictest <b>side</b> of his profession, studying it at Woolwich and entering the Engineers as the most severely scientific branch of the army, had as a first experience of war something so romantic that it has been counted incredible, yet something so relevant to the great reality of to-day that it might have been made up centuries after his death, as a myth is made up about a god. He happened to be in France in the most tragic hour that France has ever known or, please God, will ever know. She was bearing alone the weight of that alien tyranny, of that hopeless and almost lifeless violence, which the other nations have since found to be the worst of all the terrors which God tolerates in this world. She trod that winepress alone; and of the peoples there were none to help her. In 1870 the Prussian had already encircled Paris, and General Chanzy was fighting against enormous odds to push northwards to its relief, when his army was joined by the young and silent traveller from England. All that was in Kitchener's mind or motives will perhaps never be known. France was still something of an ideal of civilisation for many of the more generous English gentry. Prussia was never really an ideal for anybody, even the Prussians, and mere success, which could not make her an ideal, had not yet calamitously made her a model. There was in it also, no doubt, a touch of the schoolboy who runs away to sea--that touch of the schoolboy without the sense of which the staidest Englishman will always be inexplicable. But considered historically there is something strangely moving about the incident--the fact that Kitchener was a French soldier almost before he was an English one. As Hannibal was dedicated in boyhood to war against the eagles of Rome, Kitchener was dedicated, almost in boyhood, to war against the eagles of Germany. Romance came to this realist, whether by impulse or by accident, like a wind from without, as first love will come to the woman-hater. He was already, both by fate and choice, something more than he had meant to be. The mathematician, we might almost say the calculating boy, was already gambling in the highest lottery which led to the highest and most historic loss. The engineer devoted to discipline was already a free lance, because already a knight-errant.|$|R
