500|$|The early {{breakaway}} {{was formed}} by two riders, Gijs Van Hoecke (...) and, for the second day running, Jesper Asselman. The two riders briefly had a lead of seven minutes, but this was controlled by , especially Ian Stannard. Asselman allowed Van Hoecke to win the two early sprints for the combativity jersey and, in return, was allowed to win all three sprints in the golden kilometre. The two riders had a two-minute advantage at this point. In the main peloton, Philippe Gilbert and Andriy Hryvko (...) competed for the remaining one-second bonuses: Gilbert won the first and third; Hryvko won the second. Asselman and Van Hoecke were then caught by the peloton—led by —with [...] remaining. Despite several crashes in the final kilometres of the stage, the peloton came to the finish together. [...] attempted to lead out Tom Boonen {{as they entered the}} final , but Lotto-Soudal were able <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> Greipel <b>to</b> the <b>front</b> <b>to</b> open his sprint with [...] to the finish line. He finished comfortably ahead of Guarnieri, with Boonen in third.|$|R
60|$|Having {{stated the}} {{military}} arrangements of the captain, we may here mention {{a mode of}} defence on the open prairie, which we have heard from a veteran in the Indian trade. When a party of trappers is on a journey with a convoy of goods or peltries, every man has three pack-horses under his care; each horse laden with three packs. Every man is provided with a picket with an iron head, a mallet, and hobbles, or leathern fetters for the horses. The trappers proceed across the prairie in a long line; or sometimes three parallel lines, sufficiently distant from each other to prevent the packs from interfering. At an alarm, {{when there is no}} covert at hand, the line wheels so as <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the <b>front</b> <b>to</b> the rear and form a circle. All then dismount, drive their pickets into the ground in the centre, fasten the horses to them, and hobble their forelegs, so that, in case of alarm, they cannot break away. Then they unload them, and dispose of their packs as breastworks {{on the periphery of the}} circle; each man having nine packs behind which to shelter himself. In this promptly-formed fortress, they await the assault of the enemy, and are enabled to set large bands of Indians at defiance.|$|R

40|$|The landing {{response}} of tethered flying housefliesMusca domestica elicited by motion of periodic gratings is analysed. The {{field of view}} of the compound eyes of a fly can be subdivided into a region of binocular overlap and a monocular region. In the monocular region the landing response is elicited by motion from <b>front</b> <b>to</b> back and suppressed by motion from back <b>to</b> <b>front.</b> The sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>front</b> <b>to</b> back motion in monocular flies (one eye covered with black paint) has a maximum at an angle 60 °– 80 ° laterally from the direction of flight in the equatorial plane. The maximum of the landing response <b>to</b> <b>front</b> <b>to</b> back motion {{as a function of the}} contrast frequencyw/λ is observed at around 8 Hz. In the region of binocular overlap of monocular flies the landing response can be elicited by back <b>to</b> <b>front</b> motion around the equatorial plane if a laterally positioned pattern is simulataneously moved from <b>front</b> <b>to</b> back. 40 ° above the equatorial plane in the binocular region the landing response in binocular flies is elicited by upward motion, 40 ° below the equatorial plane in the binocular region it is elicited by downward motion. The results are interpreted as an adaptation of the visual system of the fly to the perception of a flow field having its pole in the direction of flight...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The optomotor {{following}} response, {{a behavior}} based on movement detection {{was recorded in}} the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster b fore and after the injection of picrotoxinin, an antagonist of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The directional selectivity of this response was transiently abolished or inverted after injection. This result is in agreement with picrotoxinin-induced modifications observed in electrophysiological activity of direction-selective cells in flies (Biilthoff and Schmid 1983; Schmid and Bfilthoff, in preparation). Furthermore, walking and flying flies treated with picrotoxinin followed more actively motion from back <b>to</b> <b>front</b> instead of <b>front</b> <b>to</b> back as in normal animals. Since {{the difference in the}} responses <b>to</b> <b>front</b> <b>to</b> back and back <b>to</b> <b>front</b> motions is proposed <b>to</b> be the basis of fixation behavior in flies (Reichardt 1973) our results support his notion and are inconsistent with schemes explaining fixation by alternative mechanisms. ...|$|R
