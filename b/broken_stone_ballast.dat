500|$|The {{design of}} the {{permanent}} way was a departure from that of London's previous tube railways, which used track laid on timber baulks across the tunnel with {{the bottom of the}} tube left open. This approach caused what the BS's management regarded as an unacceptable level of vibrations. They resolved this by mounting the sleepers on supports made of sand and cement grout, with the sleeper ends resting on comparatively soft <b>broken</b> <b>stone</b> <b>ballast</b> underneath the running rails. A drain ran parallel with the rails underneath the middle of the track. The rails themselves were unusually short– only [...] long– as this was the maximum length that could be brought in through the shafts and then turned horizontally to be carried into the tunnels. Power was supplied through third (positive) and fourth (negative) rails laid in the middle and outside of the track, as used on the District Railway.|$|E

40|$|Although {{it is now}} universally {{accepted}} that good-quality hard angular stone of nominal size 40 – 50 mm is the best material for ballast, historically track has been for longer on non-stone <b>ballast</b> than on <b>stone</b> <b>ballast.</b> Even the <b>stone</b> <b>ballast</b> specified up until the 1980 s was of a smaller average size than present ballast. Research into the two-layered ballast system and a study of development of ballast specification from the early 1900 s suggests that current ballast specifications should be changed to ballast of smaller size. This would: cause substantial reduction in maintenance requirements for ballasted railway track; reduce track noise levels; provide better ride quality; and increase ballast life...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} the heterotrophic microbial communities colonising <b>stone</b> <b>ballasts</b> at diesel depots. The number of bacteria (both total culturable heterotrophic bacteria and hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria) was {{proportional to the}} level of hydrocarbon contamination. However, {{there was no significant difference}} in the level of total culturable heterotrophs (TCHs) and the hydrocarbon degrading bacteria. Addition of nutrients to the ballast stimulated the biological activity and possibly the removal of hydrocarbons. However, this was only evident in the highly contaminated <b>stone</b> <b>ballasts</b> samples. The biological activity was evaluated using CO 2 production. The production of CO 2 was higher in nutrient amended treatments in which high numbers of TCHs were present. Characterisation of heterotrophic communities using Biolog revealed differences in the microbial metabolic profiles for the different sites. The results suggest that the heterotrophic microbial communities at different diesel depots are different...|$|R
