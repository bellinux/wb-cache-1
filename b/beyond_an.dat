5|$|Camouflage may extend <b>beyond</b> <b>an</b> {{aircraft}}'s airframe. High-flying aircraft {{can sometimes}} be detected by their vapor contrails. Researchers have considered whether these might be reduced {{with the use of}} chemical additives. Work was carried out on a contrail management system for B-2 stealth bombers in 1994. From the Second World War onwards, reconnaissance pilots took care to avoid creating contrails, varying their altitude as necessary; the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft was equipped with a mirror to enable the pilot to see if the plane was creating a contrail, and to take action accordingly.|$|E
5|$|The IND {{side of the}} station, the {{southern}} side, was completed in 1984, when it was named the Construction Achievement Project of the Year by the Metropolitan Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers; however, it did not open for passenger service until October 29, 1989, due to delays {{in the construction of}} the multi-level 63rd Street Tunnel, caused by the financial crisis of the 1970s. Upon the station's opening, it operated as a typical one-track, one-side platform station on each level, with only the IND side in use, while the BMT side of each level was hidden <b>beyond</b> <b>an</b> orange tiled false wall. Switches on both levels connected the lines to the west of the station.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Stoa {{was built}} upon the artificially raised {{portion of the}} Temple Mount platform. Arches {{underneath}} supported the columns of the Stoa, and provided service areas for the structures above. The Huldah Gates {{at the bottom of}} the southern wall led through corridors beneath the Stoa, rising to the Temple plaza, and served as the main entrance to the Temple compound for worshipers. Additional passages led to storage areas, and possibly provided secondary access to the Stoa and the Temple <b>beyond.</b> <b>An</b> arched overpass on the eastern side of the Temple Mount led to a gate which opened into the so-called Solomon's Stables just beneath the eastern end of the Stoa. It is widely assumed that at least part of this area was used as a storage area in conjunction with business conducted in the Stoa.|$|E

25|$|The Copyright law of 1993 had {{specified}} {{a general}} duration of copyrights of 50 years <b>beyond</b> <b>an</b> author's death, or 50 {{years since the}} publication of an anonymous work.

In 2004, this copyright term was extended to 70 years for all works still copyrighted.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the British remaining in the region, several states also held competing claims on the future state of Michigan. In 1779, Virginia established Illinois County with boundaries that encompassed all of the land east of the Mississippi River, north of the Ohio River and west of the Appalachian Mountains. For all practical purposes, however, the county government never exercised actual control <b>beyond</b> <b>an</b> area limited to a few old French settlements along the major rivers. The {{overwhelming majority of the}} northwestern lands were controlled by the native tribes. New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts also claimed portions of what was to become Michigan, but were even less able to enforce their pretensions, given Britain's control of the Great Lakes and the hostility of the tribes.|$|E

25|$|The joint venture's design, {{designated}} as the SN 600, was first revealed {{to the public as}} a scale model, described as the SN 600 Diplomate, which was displayed at the 1968 Hanover ILA Air Show. Concidentally, the reveal roughly aligned with that of a reasonably comparable aircraft, the Cessna Citation 500. While frequently contrasted with the Citation 500, the SN 600 is a larger aircraft capable of carrying more passengers, being equipped with swept wings, and was envisioned to be cheaper during its launch year. The joint venture's own forecasts for the SN 600 included, <b>beyond</b> <b>an</b> anticipated order from the French military services for 60 aircraft, a minimum of 400 of the type which were to be sold upon the global market of an anticipated demand for such a class of aircraft between 1974 and 1980 of 2,800 business jets.|$|E
25|$|Bermuda was colonised by the English as an {{extension}} of Virginia and has long had close ties with the US Atlantic Seaboard and Canadian Maritimes as well as the UK. It had a history of African slavery, although Britain abolished it decades before the US. Since the 20th century, there has been considerable immigration to Bermuda from the West Indies, as well as continued immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands. Unlike immigrants from British colonies in the West Indies, the latter immigrants have had greater difficulty in becoming permanent residents as they lacked British citizenship, mostly spoke no English, and required renewal of work permits to remain <b>beyond</b> <b>an</b> initial period. From the 1950s onwards, Bermuda relaxed its immigration laws, allowing increased immigration from Britain and Canada. Some Black politicians accused the government of using this device to counter the West Indian immigration of previous decades.|$|E

25|$|Galbraith's main ideas focused {{around the}} {{influence}} of the market power of large corporations. He believed that this market power weakened the widely accepted principle of consumer sovereignty, allowing corporations to be price makers, rather than price takers, allowing corporations with the strongest market power to increase the production of their goods <b>beyond</b> <b>an</b> efficient amount. He further believed that market power {{played a major role in}} inflation. He argued that corporations and trade unions could only increase prices to the extent to which that their market power allowed. He argued that in situations of excessive market power, price controls effectively controlled inflation, but cautioned against using them in markets that were basically efficient such as agricultural goods and housing. He noted that price controls were much easier to enforce in industries with relatively few buyers and sellers. Galbraith's view of market power was not entirely negative; he also noted that the power of U.S. firms played a part in the success of the U.S. economy.|$|E
