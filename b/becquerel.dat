5|$|Brachytherapy {{dates back}} to 1901 (shortly after the {{discovery}} of radioactivity by Henri <b>Becquerel</b> in 1896) when Pierre Curie suggested to Henri-Alexandre Danlos that a radioactive source could be inserted into a tumour.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the Russian team {{proposed}} the name becquerelium after Henri <b>Becquerel.</b> The American team in 1997 {{proposed the}} name hahnium after Otto Hahn (previously this {{name had been}} used for element 105).|$|E
5|$|While {{studying}} naturally fluorescing minerals in 1896, the French physicist Henri <b>Becquerel</b> {{discovered that}} they emitted radiation without any exposure to an external energy source. These radioactive materials {{became the subject of}} much interest by scientists, including the New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford who discovered they emitted particles. He designated these particles alpha and beta, {{on the basis of their}} ability to penetrate matter. In 1900, <b>Becquerel</b> showed that the beta rays emitted by radium could be deflected by an electric field, and that their mass-to-charge ratio was the same as for cathode rays. This evidence strengthened the view that electrons existed as components of atoms.|$|E
25|$|On 13 October 2011 {{the city}} of Yokohama {{terminated}} the use of dried shiitake-mushrooms in school lunches after tests had found radioactive cesium in them up to 350 <b>becquerels</b> per kilogram. In shiitake mushrooms grown outdoors on wood in a city in the prefecture Ibaraki, 170kilometers from the nuclear plant, samples contained 830 <b>becquerels</b> per kilogram of radioactive cesium, exceeding the government's limit of 500 <b>becquerels.</b> Radioactive contaminated shiitake mushrooms, above 500 <b>becquerels</b> per kilogram, were also found in two cities of prefecture Chiba, therefore restrictions were imposed on the shipments from these cities.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} weeks of February 2012 up to 214,200 <b>becquerels</b> of {{radioactive}} caesium per kilogram was measured in samples gravel in the quarry near Namie, situated inside the evacuation zone. The gravel stored outside showed about 60,000–210,000 <b>becquerels</b> of caesium in most samples. From the 25 quarries in the evacuation zones, up to 122,400 <b>becquerels</b> of radioactive caesium was found at {{one that has been}} closed since the nuclear crisis broke out on 11 March 2011. In one quarry, that is still operational 5,170 <b>becquerels</b> per kilogram was found. Inspections were done at some 150 of the 1.100 construction sites, where the gravel form the Namie-quarry was suspected to be used. At 27 locations the radioactivity levels were higher than the surrounding area.|$|R
2500|$|Levels of cesium in {{groundwater}} from monitoring wells {{around the}} reactors jumps by 90 times {{compared with the}} levels 3 days earlier. [...] The contamination is now measured at 9,000 <b>becquerels</b> of cesium-134 and 18,000 <b>becquerels</b> of cesium-137 per litre of water. [...] As well, tritium levels in seawater from the port next to the plant have been increasing since May, and a water sample taken on 3 July showed 2,300 <b>becquerels</b> per litre, the highest measurement {{since the start of}} the nuclear crisis in March 2011.|$|R
5|$|In the {{interests}} of standardising health-related units of measure used in the nuclear industry, the 12th CGPM (1964) accepted the continued use of the curie (symbol Ci) as a non-SI unit of activity for radionuclides; the <b>becquerel,</b> sievert and gray were adopted in later years. Similarly, the millimetre of mercury (symbol mmHg) was retained for measuring blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|She was {{acutely aware}} of the {{importance}} of promptly publishing her discoveries and thus establishing her priority. Had not <b>Becquerel,</b> two years earlier, presented his discovery to the Académie des Sciences the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity, and even a Nobel Prize, would instead have gone to Silvanus Thompson. Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the Académie on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann. Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by <b>Becquerel,</b> so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt had published his own finding in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen {{discovered}} {{the existence of}} X-rays, though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood. In 1896, Henri <b>Becquerel</b> discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power. He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Marie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{objections}} from concerned residents {{it became more}} and more difficult to dispose of the ashes of burned household garbage in and around Tokyo. The ashes of waste facilities in the Tohoku, Kanto and Kōshin'etsu regions were proven to be contaminated with radioactive cesium. According to the guidelines of the Ministry of Environment, ashes radiating 8,000 <b>becquerels</b> per kilogram or lower could be buried. Ashes with cesium levels between 8,000 and 100,000 <b>becquerels</b> should be secured, and buried in concrete vessels. A survey was done on 410 sites of waste-disposal facilities, on how the ash disposal was proceeding. At 22 sites, mainly in the Tokyo Metropolitan area, the ashes with levels under 8000 <b>becquerels</b> could not be buried due to the objections of concerned residents. At 42 sites, ashes were found that contained over 8,000 <b>becquerels</b> of cesium, which could not be buried. The ministry made plans to send officials to meetings in the municipalities to explain to the Japanese people that the waste disposal was done safely, and to demonstrate how the disposal of the ashes above 8000 <b>becquerels</b> was conducted.|$|R
25|$|In February 2014, NHK {{reported}} that TEPCO was reviewing its radioactivity data, after finding much {{higher levels of}} radioactivity than was reported earlier. TEPCO now says that levels of 5 million <b>becquerels</b> of strontium per liter were detected in groundwater collected in July 2013 and not 900,000 <b>becquerels,</b> as initially reported.|$|R
2500|$|The Japanese {{government}} bans {{shipments of}} rice from a farm near the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant. 630 <b>becquerels</b> of cesium per kilogram {{was found in}} the rice, over the 500 <b>becquerels</b> of cesium per kilogram allowed for human consumption. (From hundreds of spots tested around Fukushima, none had previously exceeded the limit.) ...|$|R
5|$|She {{was born}} in Warsaw, {{in what was then}} the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied at Warsaw's clandestine Flying University and began her {{practical}} scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her older sister Bronisława to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. She shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie and with physicist Henri <b>Becquerel.</b> She won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Prior to this, {{there had}} been failed {{synthesis}} attempts in 1986–7 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna (then in the Soviet Union) and in 1990 at the GSI; a 1995 attempt at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory resulted in signs suggesting but not pointing conclusively at {{the discovery of a}} new isotope 267Ds formed in the bombardment of 209Bi with 59Co, and a similarly inconclusive 1994 attempt at the JINR showed signs of 273Ds being produced from 244Pu and 34S. Each team proposed its own name for element 110: the American team proposed hahnium after Otto Hahn in an attempt to resolve the situation on element 105 (which they had long been suggesting this name for), the Soviet team proposed becquerelium after Henri <b>Becquerel,</b> and the German team proposed darmstadtium after Darmstadt, the location of their institute. The IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party (JWP) recognised the GSI team as discoverers in their 2001 report, giving them the right to suggest a name for the element.|$|E
5|$|The 1789 {{discovery}} of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who named the new element after the planet Uranus. Eugène-Melchior Péligot {{was the first}} person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by Henri <b>Becquerel.</b> Research by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, Enrico Fermi and others, such as J. Robert Oppenheimer starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in Little Boy, the first nuclear weapon used in war. An ensuing arms race during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived plutonium-239. The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety. See Nuclear proliferation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the city}} of Yokohama in March and October food was served to 800 people with dried shiitake-mushrooms that came from a farm near this town at a {{distance}} of 250kilometer from Fukushima. The test-results of these mushrooms showed 2,770 <b>Becquerels</b> per kilo in March and 955 <b>Becquerels</b> per kilo in October, far above the limit of 500 <b>Becquerels</b> per kilo set by the Japanese government. The mushrooms were checked for contamination {{in the first week of}} November, after requests of concerned people with questions about possible contamination of the food served. No mushrooms were sold elsewhere.|$|R

5|$|As of 2017, Nobel Prizes {{have been}} awarded to 844 men, 48 women (Marie Curie won it twice), and 27 organizations. Sixteen women {{have won the}} Nobel Peace Prize, {{fourteen}} have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, twelve have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, four have won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, two have won the Nobel Prize in Physics and one, Elinor Ostrom, has won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The first woman to win a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 with her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri <b>Becquerel.</b> Curie is also the only woman to have won multiple Nobel Prizes; in 1911, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Curie's daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935, making the two the only mother-daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes. The most Nobel Prizes awarded to women {{in a single year}} was in 2009, when five women became laureates. The most recent women to be awarded a Nobel Prize were Tu Youyou and Svetlana Alexievich (2015).|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{was first}} {{observed}} to be radioactive in 1898, by the German chemist Gerhard Carl Schmidt and later that year, independently, by the Polish-French physicist Marie Curie. It {{was the second}} element that {{was found to be}} radioactive, after the 1896 discovery of radioactivity in uranium by French physicist Henri <b>Becquerel.</b> Between 1900 and 1903, British physicists Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements. This observation led to the identification of the half-life as one of the outcomes of the alpha particle experiments that led to their disintegration theory of radioactivity. The biological effect of radiation was discovered in 1903. The newly discovered phenomenon of radioactivity excited scientists and the general public alike. In the 1920s, thorium's radioactivity was promoted as a cure for rheumatism, diabetes, and sexual impotence. In 1932, most of these uses were banned in the United States after a federal investigation into the health effects of radioactivity. Public interest in radioactivity had declined {{by the end of the}} 1930s.|$|E
25|$|According to TEPCO the {{emissions}} {{immediately after the}} accident were around 220 billion becquerel; readings declined after that, and in November and December 2011 they dropped to 17 thousand <b>becquerel,</b> about one-13 millionth the initial level. But in January 2012 due to human activities at the plant, {{the emissions}} rose again up to 19 thousand <b>becquerel.</b> Radioactive materials around reactor 2, where the surroundings were still highly contaminated, got stirred up by the workers {{going in and out}} of the building, when they inserted an optical endoscope into the containment vessel as a first step toward decommissioning the reactor.|$|E
25|$|In the {{prefecture}} Shizuoka at {{the beginning}} of April 2012, tests done on tea-leaves grown inside a greenhouse were found to contain less than 10 <b>becquerels</b> per kilogram, below the new limit of 100 <b>becquerels,</b> The tests were done in a governmental laboratory in Kikugawa city, to probe cesium-concentrations before the at the end of April the tea-harvest season would start.|$|R
50|$|The rate {{at which}} {{aperiodic}} or stochastic events occur may be expressed in <b>becquerels</b> (as {{in the case of}} radioactive decay), not hertz, since although the two are mathematically similar by convention hertz implies regularity where <b>becquerels</b> implies the requirement of a time averaging operation. Thus, one bequerel is one event per second on average whereas one hertz is one event per second on a regular cycle.|$|R
50|$|At the Fukushima Daiichi plant, 12 {{water storage}} tanks overflowed from the typhoon's heavy rains. Beta {{radiation}} levels skyrocketed to 400,000 <b>becquerels</b> {{in the wake}} of the storm, 6,500 times greater than prior to Wipha. The overflow was blamed on TEPCO's inadequate preparation and not heeding warnings of the storm. In addition, beta radiation was detected in areas beyond the levees designed to hold back contaminated water. On October 24, it was announced that radiation levels in water near the Fukushima nuclear plant reached an all-time high of 140,000 <b>becquerels,</b> greatly surpassing the previous peak of 59,000 <b>becquerels.</b> The spike in radiation is at least partially attributed to torrential rains from Typhoon Wipha.|$|R
25|$|The pyroelectric effect, {{by which}} a {{material}} generates an electric potential {{in response to a}} temperature change, was studied by Carl Linnaeus and Franz Aepinus in the mid-18th century. Drawing on this knowledge, both René Just Haüy and Antoine César <b>Becquerel</b> posited a relationship between mechanical stress and electric charge; however, experiments by both proved inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|In 1839, Alexandre Edmond <b>Becquerel</b> {{discovered}} the photovoltaic effect while studying {{the effect of}} light on electrolytic cells. Though not equivalent to the photoelectric effect, his work on photovoltaics was instrumental in showing a strong relationship between light and electronic properties of materials. In 1873, Willoughby Smith discovered photoconductivity in selenium while testing the metal for its high resistance properties in conjunction with his work involving submarine telegraph cables.|$|E
25|$|Henri Poincaré did {{not receive}} the Nobel Prize in Physics, but he had {{influential}} advocates like Henri <b>Becquerel</b> or committee member Gösta Mittag-Leffler. The nomination archive reveals that Poincaré received a total of 51 nominations between 1904 and 1912, the year of his death. Of the 58 nominations for the 1910 Nobel Prize, 34 named Poincaré. Nominators included Nobel laureates Hendrik Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman (both of 1902), Marie Curie (of 1903), Albert Michelson (of 1907), Gabriel Lippmann (of 1908) and Guglielmo Marconi (of 1909).|$|E

Minister for Consumer Affairs and Food Safety Renhō stated on 3 June 2011, that [...] "there are cases in which aracha are sold as furikake [...] and so on and they are eaten as they are, therefore we think that it is important to inspect tea leaves including aracha from the viewpoint of consumers' safety." ...|$|R
5000|$|In April 2011, {{elevated}} levels of caesium-137 were also being found in the environment after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disasters in Japan. In July 2011, meat from 11 cows shipped to Tokyo from Fukushima Prefecture {{was found to have}} 1,530 to 3,200 <b>becquerels</b> per kilogram of Cs-137, considerably exceeding the Japanese legal limit of 500 <b>becquerels</b> per kilogram at that time. In March 2013, a fish caught near the plant had a record 740,000 <b>becquerels</b> per kilogram of radioactive caesium, above the 100 <b>becquerels</b> per kilogram government limit. A 2013 paper in Scientific Reports found that for a forest site 50km from the stricken plant, Cs-137 concentrations were high in leaf litter, fungi and detritivores, but low in herbivores. By the end of 2014, [...] "Fukushima-derived radiocesium had spread into the whole western North Pacific Ocean", transported by the North Pacific current from Japan to the Gulf of Alaska.

Telesurgery was developed by Jacques Marescaux and his team on 7 September 2001 across the Atlantic Ocean (New-York-Strasbourg, Lindbergh Operation). A face transplant was first done on 27 November 2005 by Dr Bernard Devauchelle.|$|E
25|$|While <b>Becquerel</b> was {{interested}} primarily in conducting scientific research into fluorescence, Thomas Edison briefly pursued fluorescent lighting for its commercial potential. He invented a fluorescent lamp in 1896 that used a coating of calcium tungstate as the fluorescing substance, excited by X-rays, but although it received a patent in 1907, {{it was not}} put into production. As with a few other attempts to use Geissler tubes for illumination, it had a short operating life, and given {{the success of the}} incandescent light, Edison had little reason to pursue an alternative means of electrical illumination. Nikola Tesla made similar experiments in the 1890s, devising high-frequency powered fluorescent bulbs that gave a bright greenish light, but as with Edison's devices, no commercial success was achieved.|$|E
25|$|A {{solar cell}} is any device that {{directly}} converts the energy in light into electrical energy {{through the process}} of photovoltaics. Although French physicist Antoine-César <b>Becquerel</b> discovered the photovoltaic effect much earlier in 1839, the first solar cell, according to Encyclopædia Britannica, was invented by Charles Fritts in 1883, who used junctions formed by coating selenium with an extremely thin layer of gold. In 1941, the silicon solar cell was invented by another American named Russell Ohl. Drawing upon Ohl's work, three American researchers named Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller, and Daryl Chapin essentially introduced the first practical use of solar panels through their improvement of the silicone solar cell in 1954, which by placing them in direct sunlight, free electrons are turned into electric current enabling a six percent energy conversion efficiency.|$|E
