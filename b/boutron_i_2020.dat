We found 3 heterozygous missense (novel I 2012 T, G 2019 S, and <b>I</b> <b>2020</b> T) mutations in LRRK 2 exon 41. We identified 11 among 868 PD probands (1. 3 %) including 2 sporadic cases and 8 of 130 (6. 2 %) autosomal dominant PD families. The LRRK 2 mutations in exon 41 exhibited relatively common and worldwide distribution. Among the 3 mutations in exon 41, {{it has been}} reported that Caucasian patients with G 2019 S mutation have a single founder effect. In the present study, Japanese patients with G 2019 S were unlikely to have a single founder from the Caucasian patients. In contrast, <b>I</b> <b>2020</b> T mutation has a single founder effect in Japanese patients. Clinically, patients with LRRK 2 mutations had typical idiopathic PD. Notably, several patients developed dementia and psychosis, and one with <b>I</b> <b>2020</b> T had low cardiac 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) heart/mediastinum ratio, although the ratio was not low in other patients with <b>I</b> <b>2020</b> T or G 2019 S.

40|$|The LRRK 2 {{mutation}} {{is a major}} causal {{mutation in}} familial Parkinson’s disease. Although LRRK 2 contains functional GTPase and kinase domains and their activities are altered by pathogenic mutations, most studies focused on LRRK 2 kinase activity because the most prevalent mutant, G 2019 S, enhances kinase activity. However, the G 2019 S mutation is extremely rare in the Asian population. Instead, the G 2385 R mutation was reported as a major risk factor in the Asian population. Similar to other LRRK 2 studies, G 2385 R studies have also focused on kinase activity. Here, we investigated GTPase activities of G 2385 R with other LRRK 2 mutants, such as G 2019 S, R 1441 C, and <b>I</b> <b>2020</b> T, as well as wild type (WT). Our results suggest that both <b>I</b> <b>2020</b> T and G 2385 R contain GTPase activities stronger than that of WT.

In the present study, we investigated {{for the first time}} a transgenic (TG) mouse strain expressing human LRRK 2 with an <b>I</b> <b>2020</b> T mutation in the kinase domain, which had been detected in the patients of the original PARK 8 family. Results The TG mouse expressed <b>I</b> <b>2020</b> T LRRK 2 in dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and olfactory bulb. In both the beam test and rotarod test, the TG mice exhibited impaired locomotive ability in comparison with their non-transgenic (NTG) littermates. Although there was no obvious loss of DA neurons in either the substantia nigra or striatum, the TG brain showed several neurological abnormalities such as a reduced striatal dopamine content, fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus in DA neurons, and an increased degree of microtubule polymerization. Furthermore, the tyrosine hydroxylase-positive primary neurons derived from the TG mouse showed an increased frequency of apoptosis and had neurites with fewer branches and decreased outgrowth in comparison with those derived from the NTG controls. Conclusions The <b>I</b> <b>2020</b> T LRRK 2 TG mouse exhibited impaired locomotive ability accompanied by several dopaminergic neuron abnormalities.

40|$|Activating {{mutations}} in the leucine rich repeat protein kinase 2 (LRRK 2) gene {{are the most}} common cause of inherited Parkinson’s disease (PD). LRRK 2 is phosphorylated on a cluster of phosphosites including Ser 910, Ser 935, Ser 955 and Ser 973, which are dephosphorylated in several PD-related LRRK 2 mutants (N 1437 H, R 1441 C/G, Y 1699 C and <b>I</b> <b>2020</b> T) linking the regulation of these sites to PD. These serine residues are also dephosphorylated after kinase inhibition and lose 14 - 3 - 3 binding, which serves as a pharmacodynamic marker for inhibited LRRK 2. Loss of 14 - 3 - 3 binding is well established, but the consequences of dephosphorylation are only now being uncovered. In the present study, we found that potent and selective inhibition of LRRK 2 kinase activity leads to dephosphorylation of Ser 935 then ubiquitination and degradation of a significant fraction of LRRK 2. GNE 1023 treatment decreased the phosphorylation and stability of LRRK 2 in expression systems and endogenous LRRK 2 in A 549 cells and in mouse dosing studies. We next established that LRRK 2 is ubiquitinated through at least Lys 48 and Lys 63 ubiquitin linkages in response to inhibition. To investigate the link between dephosphorylation induced by inhibitor treatment and LRRK 2 ubiquitination, we studied LRRK 2 in conditions where it is dephosphorylated such as expression of PD mutants [R 1441 G, Y 1699 C and <b>I</b> <b>2020</b> T] or by blocking 14 - 3 - 3 binding to LRRK 2 via difopein expression, and found LRRK 2 is hyper-ubiquitinated. Calyculin A treatment prevents inhibitor and PD mutant induced dephosphorylation and reverts LRRK 2 to a lesser ubiquitinated species, thus directly implicating phosphatase activity in LRRK 2 ubiquitination.

LRRK 2 is a complex kinase consisting of LRR, ROC, COR, kinase, and WD 40 domains [5]. The Sagamihara family patients have the <b>I</b> <b>2020</b> T mutation in the kinase domain [2].

It also determines CO 2 intensity cuts that would be needed in those countries and regions if the emission reductions were achieved through intensity-based targets while assuming no effect on forecasted economic growth. Considering that the stabilization of CO 2 concentrations at 450 ppm requires the global trend of CO 2 emissions to reverse before 2030, this study develops two scenarios: reversing the global CO 2 trend in (<b>i)</b> <b>2020</b> and (ii) 2025.

Mengden tilgjengelige roterende {{reserver}} og primærreserver bestemmer systemets kortsiktige respons. Norge og Sverige inngikk i 2012 en avtale om økt energiproduksjon på 24, 6 TWh fra ny fornybar energi, kalt grønne sertifikater. Det antas at ny installert effekt fra vindkraft og uregulerbar vannkraft vil være ca. 12 500 MW <b>i</b> <b>2020.</b> Disse prognosene er studert i simuleringsprogrammet Aristo. Simuleringene i Aristo viser frekvensforløp til identiske utfall av forbruk og produksjon, der systemets frekvens logges i 45 sekunder etter utfallet finner sted. Utfallene av forbruk og produksjon er basert på dimensjonerende utfall for Norge og synkronsystemet Norden, og er av størrelsesorden 850 MW, 1200 MW og 1360 MW. Utfallene er simulert i produksjonssituasjoner som representerer 2014 og 2020. Vi kan se fra simuleringen at systemet har en høyere H-verdi i 2014, enn <b>i</b> <b>2020.</b> Resultatene viser at systemets reguleringsevne svekkes med økt andel uregulerbar kraft i samtlige produksjons- og lastsituasjoner. Bare ett av tre scenarier simulert for 2020 overholdt dagens krav til systemets reguleringskapasitet. Resultatene fra simuleringene i Aristo lot seg ikke separeres i effekter som skyldes ny uregulerbar produksjon eller av endret kraftflyt. Simulatorprogrammet Aristo er derfor ikke godt egnet til å studere mekanismene bak de simulerte frekvensforløp i Norden og er bedre egnet for spenningsanalyser og frekvensanalyser i øydrift for mindre avgrensede områder. Det er krav om at frekvensstabiliteten ikke skal svekkes for å unngå problemer og kostnader for forbrukerne. Det betyr økte systemkostnader for systemansvarlig. Økte balanseringskostnader dekkes av økt innmatingstariff for samtlige kraftprodusenter. Dette bryter med et prinsipp for samfunnsøkonomi som tilsier at en enhet som påfører systemet en kostnad, bør belastes kostnaden. Felles innmatingstariff for samtlige kraftprodusenter begrunnes med politisk vedtatt satsningen på økt utbygging av fornybar kraft. Abstract This thesis analyses simulated {{effects of}} increased installed unregulated {{power in the}} interconnected grid in the Nordic countries in 2020. The purpose {{is to examine the}} effects of new renewable production, and the system's ability to maintain a short-term frequency stability. The total rotatational inertia and primary frequency control are the short-term frequency responses of the power system. The agreement on green certificates from 2012, will initiate new renewable energy production of total 24, 6 TWh in Norway and Sweden. It is believed that the installed capacity of wind turbines and small-scale hydropower will be 12 500 MW by 2020. This prognosis is further studied in the simulation program Aristo. The simulations in Aristo show the development of the system frequency at losses of consumption or production. The system frequency is logged for 45 seconds after the fault occurs. The frequency deviations that occur when consumption or production is lost, is dimentional to the size of the incident. The size of the faults studied, are the biggest faults the power system of Nordic synchronous area are designed to handle. Fault sizes are 850 MW, 1200 MW and 1360 MW. The faults are simulated in different production modes which represent year 2014 and 2020. We can see from the simulation that the system reaches a higher frequency, and the frequency deviation is bigger at identical incidents in 2020 from 2014. The results show that the system frequency control deteriorates with increased amount of wind and small-scale hydropower production units. Only one of the three scenarios simulated for 2020, complied within the limits of the required control capacity of the power system. The effects arising from renewable power production, or from the change of system power flow, could not be isolated or determinated in the simulations. Aristo is therefore not well suited for analysis of total power system stability of the interconnected synchrounous grid. Aristo is better suited for analysis which involves voltage deviations and stability, or frequency analysis studied in grid islands. A decrease in frequency stability, leads to increased demand for frequency control. The TSO`s demand for primary control increase, meaning increased system stability costs. The increased system operating costs, are today covered by tariffs for all power producers. This violates a principle of economics, that indicates that a unit that inflicts the system a cost, should be charged by this cost. Equal increase of tariffs for all power producers, is justified by the political focus on increased development of renewable energy. M-B...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the plethora}} of {{sequence}} variants in LRRK 2, only a few clearly segregate with PD. Even within this group of pathogenic mutations, the phenotypic profile can differ widely. We examined multiple properties of LRRK 2 behavior in cellular models over-expressing three sequence variants described in Greek PD patients in comparison to several known pathogenic and non-pathogenic LRRK 2 mutations, to determine if specific phenotypes associated with pathogenic LRRK 2 {{can be observed in}} other less-common sequence variants for which pathogenicity is unclear based on clinical and/or genetic data alone. The oligomerization, activity, phosphorylation, and interaction with FADD was assessed in HEK 293 T cells over-expressing LRRK 2; while the induction of neuronal death was determined by quantifying apoptotic nuclei in primary neurons transiently expressing LRRK 2. One LRRK 2 variant, A 211 V, exhibited a modest increase in kinase activity, whereas only the pathogenic mutants G 2019 S and <b>I</b> <b>2020</b> T displayed significantly altered auto-phosphorylation. We observed an induction of detergent-insoluble high molecular weight structures upon expression of pathogenic LRRK 2 mutants, but not the other LRRK 2 variants. In contrast, each of the variants tested induced apoptotic death of cultured neurons similar to pathogenic LRRK 2 in a FADD-dependent manner. Overall, despite differences in some properties of LRRK 2 function such as kinase activity and its oligomerization, each of the LRRK 2 variants examined induced neuronal death to a similar extent. Furthermore, our findings further strengthen the notion of a convergence on the extrinsic cell death pathway common to mutations in LRRK 2 that are capable of inducing neuronal death...|$|R

In characterizing the novel ROC domain mutant A 1442 P, we {{compared}} its steady-state protein levels, propensity to aggregate, and toxicity with the pathogenic R 1441 C mutant and wild-type (WT) LRRK 2. Mutant (R 1441 C and A 1442 P) and WT LRRK 2 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and FLAG were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells using plasmid constructs. Western analysis and fluorescence microscopy consistently demonstrated lower mutant LRRK 2 protein levels compared with WT. A time-course expression study using flow cytometry showed that WT LRRK 2 expression increased initially but then plateaued by 72 hr. Conversely, R 1441 C and A 1442 P mutant expression attained 85 % and 74 % of WT levels at 24 hr but fell to 68 % and 55 % of WT levels by 72 hr, respectively. We found that proteasome inhibition markedly increased mutant LRRK 2 to levels approaching those of WT. Taken together, our findings reveal increased intracellular degradation for both mutants. Furthermore, the impact of mutant and WT LRRK 2 expression on HEK 293 cell viability was assessed under normative and oxidative (hydrogen peroxide) conditions and found not to differ. Expression of WT and mutant LRRK 2 protein gave rise to intracellular aggregates of similar appearance and cellular localization. In summary, we provide evidence that the novel A 1442 P mutant and the previously investigated R 1441 C pathogenic mutant exhibit increased intracellular degradation, a property reportedly demonstrated for the pathogenic LRRK 2 kinase domain mutant <b>I</b> <b>2020</b> T...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the motor phenotype of LRRK 2 G 2019 S mutation carriers. LRRK 2 mutation carriers were previously reported to manifest the tremor dominant motor phenotype, {{which has been}} associated with slower motor progression and less cognitive impairment compared with the postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) phenotype. Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Setting: Thirteen movement disorders centers. Participants: Nine hundred twenty-five early-onset Parkinson disease cases defined as age at onset younger than 51 years. Main Outcome Measures: LRRK 2 mutation status and Parkinson disease motor phenotype: tremor dominant or PIGD. Demographic information, family history of Parkinson disease, and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score were collected on all participants. DNA samples were genotyped for LRRK 2 mutations (G 2019 S, <b>I</b> <b>2020</b> T, R 1441 C, and Y 1699 C). Logistic regression was used to examine associations of G 2019 S mutation status with motor phenotype adjusting for disease duration, Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, levodopa dose, and family history of Parkinson disease. Results: Thirty-four cases (3. 7 %) (14 previously reported) were G 2019 S carriers. No other mutations were found. Carriers {{were more likely to be}} Ashkenazi Jewish (55. 9 % vs 11. 9 %; P <. 001) but did not significantly differ in any other demographic or disease characteristics. Carriers had a lower tremor score (P =. 03) and were more likely to have a PIGD phenotype (92. 3 % vs 58. 9 %; P =. 003). The association of the G 2019 S mutation with PIGD phenotype remained after controlling for disease duration and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry (odds ratio, 17. 7; P <. 001). Conclusion: Early-onset Parkinson disease G 2019 S LRRK 2 carriers are more likely to manifest the PIGD phenotype, which may have implications for disease course...|$|R

40|$|Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK 2) are {{currently}} {{the most common}} genetic cause of familial late-onset Parkinson disease, which is clinically indistinguishable from idiopathic disease. The most common pathological mutation in LRRK 2, G 2019 S LRRK 2, is known to cause neurite retraction. However, molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of neurite length by LRRK 2 are unknown. Here, we demonstrate a novel interaction between LRRK 2 and the Rho GTPase, Rac 1, which plays {{a critical role in}} actin cytoskeleton remodeling necessary for the maintenance of neurite morphology. LRRK 2 binds strongly to endogenous or expressed Rac 1, while showing weak binding to Cdc 42 and no binding to RhoA. Co-expression with LRRK 2 increases Rac 1 activity, as shown by increased binding to the p 21 -activated kinase, which modulates actin cytoskeletal dynamics. LRRK 2 constructs carrying mutations that inactivate the kinase or GTPase activities do not activate Rac 1. Interestingly, LRRK 2 does not increase levels of membrane-bound Rac 1 but dramatically changes the cellular localization of Rac 1, causing polarization, which is augmented further when LRRK 2 is co-expressed with constitutively active Rac 1. Four different disease-related mutations in LRRK 2 altered binding to Rac 1, with the G 2019 S and R 1441 C LRRK 2 mutations attenuating Rac 1 binding and the Y 1699 C and <b>I</b> <b>2020</b> T LRRK 2 mutations increasing binding. Co-expressing Rac 1 in SH-SY 5 Y cells rescues the G 2019 S mutant phenotype of neurite retraction. We hypothesize that pathological mutations in LRRK 2 attenuates activation of Rac 1, causing disassembly of actin filaments, leading to neurite retraction. The interactions between LRRK 2 and Rho GTPases provide a novel pathway through which LRRK 2 might modulate cellular dynamics and contribute to the pathophysiology of Parkinson disease...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMutations in the Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase- 2 (LRRK 2) gene cause late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK 2, {{contains}} Leucine Rich Repeats, a GTPase domain, a COR domain, a kinase and a WD 40 motif. Little {{is known}} about how LRRK 2 is regulated, what its physiological substrates are or how mutations affect LRRK 2 function. Thus far LRRK 2 activity has only been assessed by autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of myelin basic protein, which is catalysed rather slowly. We undertook a KESTREL screen in rat brain extracts to identify proteins that were phosphorylated by an activated PD mutant of LRRK 2 (G 2019 S). This led to the discovery that moesin, a protein which anchors the actin-cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, is efficiently phosphorylated by LRRK 2, at Thr 558, a previously identified in vivo phosphorylation site that regulates the ability of moesin to bind actin. LRRK 2 also phosphorylated ezrin and radixin {{that are related to}} moesin, at the residue equivalent to Thr 558, as well as a peptide encompassing Thr 558 (LRRKtide). We exploited these findings to determine how nine previously reported PD mutations of LRRK 2 affected kinase activity. Only one of the mutations analysed, namely G 2019 S, stimulated kinase activity. Four mutations inhibited LRRK 2 kinase activity (R 1941 H, I 2012 T, <b>I</b> <b>2020</b> T and G 2385 R), whereas the remainder (R 1441 C, R 1441 G, Y 1699 C and T 2356 I), did not influence activity. Therefore, the manner in which LRRK 2 mutations induce PD, is more complex than previously imagined, and not only caused by an increase of LRRK 2 kinase activity. Finally, we show that the minimum catalytically active fragment of LRRK 2, requires an intact GTPase, COR and kinase domain as well as WD 40 motif and C-terminal tail. This study suggests that moesin, ezrin and radixin may comprise LRRK 2 substrates, findings that have been exploited to develop the first robust quantitative assay to measure LRRK 2 kinase activity...|$|R
