5|$|Beaumont almost {{instantly}} became a boomtown with investors {{from around the}} state and the nation participating in land speculation. Investment in Texas speculation in 1901 reached approximately $235 million US (approximately $ in present-day terms). The level of oil speculation in Pennsylvania and other areas of the United States was quickly surpassed by the speculation in Texas. The Lucas gusher itself was short-lived; production fell to 10,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day by 1904. The strike, however, was only the beginning of a much larger trend.|$|E
5|$|Wooden casks {{were still}} in use in the 1960s. The cask beer line was removed in 1976, but {{restored}} in 1984. In 1984 the original brewhouse was converted into a brewery museum. In November 1985 a new £5 million brewhouse opened. Production of Foster's Lager began in 1987. By 1989 the brewery had a production capacity of 1.2 million <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> annum. Scottish & Newcastle used the John Smith's Brewery to brew many of its ale brands. In 2004, a new £24 million bottling facility was opened in 2004, described as the most modern bottling facility in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Resident Office {{moved from}} Marudi to Miri in 1912. Miri grew {{as fast as}} the rate of oil {{production}} by the Shell company. In 1920, roads were built in Miri. Bicycles and motorcycles were also bought into the town. By 1921, there were 40 shop houses in Miri, with one English school and one Chinese school. Motor cars were later introduced to the town. In 1924, Pujut Road was built to link Miri with Lutong. By 1925, rotary drilling was introduced. Oil production continued to increase until it reached a peak of 15,211 <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day in 1929. Water supply were improved, jungles were cleared, and more roads were built. Miri became the administrative centre of the entire Baram region in 1929.|$|E
5|$|The Bahraini Economic Vision 2030 {{published}} in 2008 {{does not indicate}} how the stated goal of shifting from an economy built on oil wealth to a productive, globally competitive economy will be attained. Bahrain has already diversified its exports to some extent, out of necessity. It has the smallest hydrocarbon reserves of any Gulf state, producing 48,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day from its one onshore field. The bulk of the country’s revenue comes from its share in the offshore field administered by Saudi Arabia. The gas reserve in Bahrain is expected to last for less than 27 years, leaving the country with few sources of capital to pursue {{the development of new}} industries. Investment in research and development remained very low in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Sarawak Shell Bintulu Plant (SSBP), {{formerly}} known as Bintulu Crude Oil Terminal (BCOT), was established in 1979. It consists of three crude oil storage tanks, each with a capacity of 410,000 barrels. It has three major areas of operation: Crude Oil Operations, Condensate Stabilisation, and Gas Sales Facilities. Royal Dutch Shell started to establish the world's first Shell Middle Distillate Synthesis plant (Shell MDS) in 1993. It {{is also known as}} Bintulu Gas-To-Liquid plant (Bintulu GTL). The plant has a production capacity of 14,770 <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day with a total investment of over US$1billion as of the year 2010.

5|$|A year later, when OPEC met in Vienna on 4 December 2015, the {{organization}} had exceeded its production ceiling for 18 consecutive months, US oil production had declined only slightly from its peak, world markets {{appeared to be}} oversupplied by at least 2 million <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day despite war-torn Libya pumping 1 million barrels below capacity, oil producers were making major adjustments to withstand prices as low as the $40s, Indonesia was rejoining the export organization, Iraqi production had surged after years of disorder, Iranian output was poised to rebound with the lifting of international sanctions, hundreds of world leaders at the Paris Climate Agreement were committing to limit carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and solar technologies were becoming steadily more competitive and prevalent. In light of all these market pressures, OPEC decided to set aside its ineffective production ceiling until the next ministerial conference in June 2016. By 20 January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket was down to US$22.48/bbl – less than one-fourth of its high from June 2014 ($110.48), less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up.|$|E

25|$|The Libyan {{interior}} ministry reported on 3 May 2012 {{that the oil}} fields were operating in a normal fashion and the production was good. He added that the production of oil had reached 1.55 million <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day the previous week, almost pre-war levels. However, by September 2013, armed groups were blockading oilfields, cutting production to about 100,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> day, leading to some fuel shortages and blackouts. Many in the armed groups were current and former employees of units set up to secure the oilfields, reacting to corruption and low pay.|$|E
50|$|The {{refinery}} {{project is}} being implemented at a capital cost of Rs 270,000 million being funded through {{a mix of}} equity and debt. This represents a capital cost of less than US$10,000 <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>per</b> day and compares very favourably with the average capital cost of new refineries announced in recent years. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates the average capital cost of new refinery in the OECD nations {{to be in the}} region of US$15,000 to 20,000 <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>per</b> day. The low capital cost of RPL becomes even more attractive when adjusted for high complexity of the refinery.|$|R
50|$|The cost of oil {{worldwide}} {{rose from}} $71.40 <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> to $73.50 <b>per</b> <b>barrel,</b> {{the highest in}} eight months, before the trend reversed sharply; the total increase due to Perkins's trading was more than $1.50 <b>per</b> <b>barrel,</b> which is generally only caused by major events with geopolitical significance.

40|$|Oil prices {{collapsed}} {{beginning in}} late 1997 {{from an average}} of $ 17 <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> (dated Brent used as a wide reference at the time) to a low of just above $ 10 <b>per</b> <b>barrel.</b> This low level, which was reached as early as March/April 1998, held with some fluctuations, until early 1999. The fall was of the order of 40 percent. The impact on the export revenues of oil-exporting countries was severe. The base price of $ 17 <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> that has been characteristic of oil price movements since 1989 was not very rewarding. A 40 percent fall from this level involves a greater percentage fall from net unit revenues since that number, equal to price minus unit costs, is smaller than the <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> price. To illustrate, assuming that average per unit cost was about $ 1. 5 <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> at the time, per unit revenue at $ 17 <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> would have been $ 15. 5 <b>per</b> <b>barrel.</b> A $ 7 <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> price fall would have reduced revenue by 45 percent...|$|R
