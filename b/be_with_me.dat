[...] Soldiers and passersby mock him about it. Two convicted thieves are crucified along with Jesus. In Matthew and Mark, both thieves mock Jesus. In Luke, one of them rebukes Jesus, while the other defends him. Jesus tells the latter: [...] "today you will <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in Paradise" [...] (Luke 23:43). In John, Mary, the mother of Jesus, and the beloved disciple were at the crucifixion. Jesus tells the beloved disciple to take of his mother (John 19:26–27).|$|E

500|$|The Duke and Duchess {{settled in}} France. In May 1939, the Duke was {{commissioned}} by NBC to give a radio broadcast (his first since abdicating) {{during a visit to}} the battlefields of Verdun. In it he appealed for peace, saying [...] "I am deeply conscious of the presence of the great company of the dead, and I am convinced that could they make their voices heard they would <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in what I am about to say. I speak simply as a soldier of the Last War whose most earnest prayer it is that such cruel and destructive madness shall never again overtake mankind. There is no land whose people want war." [...] The broadcast was heard across the world and by millions in America. It was widely seen as supporting appeasement, and the BBC refused to broadcast it. It was broadcast outside the United States on shortwave radio and was reported in full by British broadsheet newspapers.|$|E
500|$|... "Evermore"'s lamenting melody is {{paired with}} lyrics that express loneliness, {{accompanied}} by heavy orchestration that swells and loudens as the ballad progresses. Both [...] "brooding" [...] and hopeful {{at the same}} time, Jay Jason of Comicbook.com believes that the song's lyrics are inspired by the popular saying [...] "If you love someone, let them go." [...] Stevens' voice quavers with emotion when he sings the phrase [...] "I never needed anybody in my life". Amanda Greever of The Daily Times insists that the song's lyrics will move all listeners to tears. Featuring lyrics that revolve around heartache and heartbreak, [...] "Evermore"'s chorus reads: [...] "Now I know she'll never leave me/Even as she runs away/She will still torment me/Call me, hurt me/Move me, come what may/Wasting in my lonely tower/Waiting by an open door/I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in/And <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> for evermore", which Stevens performs vulnerably. The track also discusses themes such as true love, sacrifice and learning to understand love. Stevens sings within the vocal range of a [...] "deep, resonating baritone" [...] throughout the song, which lasts a total duration of three minutes and fourteen seconds; Channel NewsAsia contributor Genevieve Sarah Loh compared Stevens' voice, whose notes are suspended by the instrumentation, to [...] "melted-chocolate", gradually becoming more human-sounding as the song progresses. Belting comfortably, Stevens' voice {{has been compared to}} that of Terrence Man, the actor who originated the role of the Beast in the Broadway adaptation and recorded [...] "If I Can't Love Her". Some traces of Auto-Tune can be heard in Stevens' performance.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} this goal, Nietzsche parodied a passage from the New Testament, which the Nietzsche-Archiv, headed by Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, decided to suppress so {{that there would be}} no doubt as to the strict correctness of Nietzsche's use of the Bible. According to Nietzsche, one of the thieves, who was also being crucified, said, [...] "This was truly a divine man, a child of God!" [...] Nietzsche had Christ reply, [...] "If you feel this, you are in Paradise, you are a child of God." [...] In the Bible, only Luke related a dialogue between Christ and the thief in which the thief said, [...] "This man has done nothing wrong" [...] to which, Christ replied, [...] "Today I tell you, you will <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in Paradise." [...] (Luke 23: 39-43) Nietzsche had the thief speaking the words that the centurion later spoke in Luke 23: 47, Matthew 27: 54, and Mark 15: 39. In these passages, Christ was called the Son of God by the soldier. The Nietzsche Archives' suppression was lifted in later editions and now appears exactly as Nietzsche wrote.|$|E
