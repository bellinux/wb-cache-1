500|$|As {{a result}} of World War II in the 1940s, Asch and other social psychologists were {{interested}} in propaganda. They wondered: How do you get people to <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want them to believe? How do you get people to believe they should sacrifice for the war effort? ...|$|E
500|$|... "Acrobat" [...] {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{personal}} songs on Achtung Baby with Bono acknowledging personal weakness, contradictions, and inadequacy. The Edge noted that the song contained [...] "a bit of venom", likening it to [...] "the bitter, John Lennon tradition of 'Working Class Hero', slightly snarling and cynical." [...] Bono stated [...] "as we moved from the eighties to the nineties, I stopped throwing rocks at the obvious symbols of power and the abuse of it. I started throwing rocks at my own hypocrisy... 'Acrobat' [...] 'Don't <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> hear, don't <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> see / If you just close your eyes / You can feel the enemy...' I can't remember it, but the point is: you start to see the world in a different way, and you're part of the problem, not just part of the solution". In 2006, he noted it was [...] "a song about being a hypocrite, and I think we all can be and I certainly have been. And you know, you exact very high standards on people in the world but then you don't live them personally", noting the theme was most evident in the lyric [...] "I must be an acrobat to talk like this and act like that". Hot Press editor Niall Stokes felt The Edge's guitar playing combined elements of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] with [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky". Speaking of its theme he said [...] "at its heart is an awareness of the ravages of time, and what it does to people and to relationships. But beyond that, there is the self-awareness that, itself, comes only with experience... Bono acknowledges his own weakness and inadequacy. He is more conscious now than ever before of the contradictions in his own position." [...] Andy Greene of Rolling Stone believed the [...] "aggressive and venomous" [...] song reflected Bono's thoughts during the album sessions, saying [...] "Nearly every lyric brims with rage... It was a new decade and it was quite possible they were about to be dismissed as a relic of the past." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Fool in Love" [...] was {{released}} in July 1960 and became an immediate hit, peaking at number 2 on the Hot R Sides chart and number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 that October. Kurt Loder described the track as [...] "the blackest record to ever creep into the white pop charts since Ray Charles' gospel-styled 'What'd I Say' that previous summer." [...] A second pop hit, [...] "It's Gonna Work Out Fine" [...] (1961), reached the top 20 and earned the group a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock and Roll Performance. Notable singles released during the duo's Sue Records period included the R hits, [...] "I Idolize You", [...] "Poor Fool", and [...] "Tra-La-La-La." [...] In 1964, Ike & Tina left Sue and signed with Kent Records, releasing the modest single, [...] "I Can't <b>Believe</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Say." [...] The following year, they signed with Loma Records, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Records and run by Bob Krasnow, who had become their manager shortly after they left Sue Records. Between 1964 and 1969, Ike & Tina signed with more than ten labels.|$|E

2500|$|Whilst Clarkson {{states such}} views in his columns {{and in public}} appearances, his public persona does not {{necessarily}} represent his personal views, as he acknowledged whilst interviewing Alastair Campbell saying [...] "I don't believe what I write, {{any more than you}} [...] <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say".|$|E
2500|$|He {{traveled}} all over China. In the 1930s K. P. Chen {{would go into}} the Chinese countryside and attempt to make small farmers [...] "banking-conscious", as observed by a Chartered Bank manager who accompanied Chen on one of his stints. [...] "Don't go to Sinkiang. It's a very hard trip—even dangerous. And when you come back, no one will <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> find there." [...] he once told a Time Inc.'s Nanking correspondent, Frederick Gruin.|$|E
2500|$|Jett has {{consistently}} refused to either {{confirm or deny}} rumors that she is lesbian or bisexual. In a 1994 interview with Out magazine she said, [...] "I'm not saying no, I'm not saying yes, I'm saying <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want. Assume away—go ahead." [...] In 2006, she also addressed the rumors that she is an open lesbian by saying, [...] "I never made any kind of statement about my personal life on any level. I never made any proclamations. So I don't know where people are getting that from." ...|$|E

6000|$|There {{are those}} who scoff at the schoolboy, calling him {{frivolous}} and shallow: Yet it was the schoolboy who said [...] "Faith is <b>believing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> know ain't so." [...] --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear child," [...] said Ermine, [...] "she is {{our great}} blessing, and some day I trust {{will be the}} same to her dear father. Oh, Colin! it is too much to hope that <b>you</b> have not <b>believed</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> must have heard! And yet you wrote to him." ...|$|R
2500|$|Lerner {{points out}} that grey and black {{operations}} ultimately have a heavy cost, in that the target population sooner or later recognizes them as propaganda and discredits the source. He writes, [...] "This {{is one of the}} few dogmas advanced by Sykewarriors that is likely to endure as an axiom of propaganda: Credibility is a condition of persuasion. Before you can make a man do as you say, you must make him <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say." [...] Consistent with this idea, the Allied strategy in World War II was predominantly one of truth (with certain exceptions).|$|E
2500|$|Neal Ascherson defended Kapuściński in March 2010 by saying: [...] "None of the doubts, {{as far as}} I can see, {{are about}} the despatches and {{features}} he sent to newspapers, or to the Polish Press Agency. They are about his books. The adventures and encounters he describes in his books are on a different level of veracity. Like his friend Gabriel García Márquez, Kapuściński {{used to talk about}} [...] "literary reportage". You're meant to <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are being told, but not in every literal detail. [...] Scrupulous in his journalism, in his books he was capable of inventing {{in order to make a}} truth even truer. He was a great story-teller, but not a liar." ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry {{suffers from}} suriphobia (fear of rats), similar to his son's fear of snakes, and, apparently, also from acrophobia. He {{also has a}} habit of saying [...] "This is intolerable!" [...] in {{particularly}} trying circumstances. When Indy punches a Nazi while on the tank, he shouts, [...] "You call this archaeology?!" [...] Throughout the film, Henry is shocked by his son's violent lifestyle, such as when he guns down a pair of Nazis, saying [...] "Look what you did! I can't <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> did!" [...] He also is unimpressed when his son defeats their Nazi pursuers with only a pole during their escape on motorcycle. During the tank battle, though, he blows up a truck full of Nazis to Brody's horror, explaining [...] "It's war!" ...|$|E

5000|$|During a {{difficult}} childhood, Bibiano {{was unable to}} pay for BJJ training. His instructor said he‘d continue to train him, {{as long as he}} cleaned the gym after the class.
