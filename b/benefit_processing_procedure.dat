40|$|This {{undergraduate}} thesis presents {{details of}} the RCERO Ljubljana project, the Regional Waste Management Centre with its most important part: the mechanical-biological treatment plant. The plant has been constructed for the reception and processing of household waste, bulky waste, biodegradable waste and waste from craft activities, manufacturing and service activities {{for the city of}} Ljubljana and the Central Slovenia region. The presentation covers a description of the facilities and installations at the plant. Individual groups of activities are presented, including waste <b>processing</b> <b>procedures</b> and the connections and interconnections between <b>processing</b> <b>procedures</b> at a plant of this type. Waste processing is necessary and important for reducing the quantities of waste placed in andfill and for increasing the use of renewable sources obtained from waste processing. Individual groups and sub- groups of mechanical and biological waste processing herefore take place at the plant. Waste fractions capable of being used for recycling and fractions serving as raw materials for the preparation of secondary fuels are obtained by means of the mechanical processing of waste with separation. In biological processing, biogas is obtained from biodegradable waste through a process of anaerobic fermentation. This gas is used as a fuel in waste <b>processing</b> <b>procedures.</b> Furthermore, the thesis addresses the optimisation of <b>processing</b> <b>procedures</b> via an analysis of waste <b>processing</b> <b>procedures</b> and data. The daily plan, {{in the form of a}} table, is a plan for the optimal use of working time, depending on the waste <b>processing</b> <b>procedures</b> involved. The daily plan table for waste processing has been already in use at the plant for the processing of waste and the analysis of procedures...|$|R

30|$|In those papers, all {{authors have}} {{referred}} to their customize simulators and code by using object-oriented language for expansion modules, which follow object-oriented design rules; therefore, those system architectures posses the convenience for modification and the flexibility for expansion. However, those properties are difficult to quantify and have a consistent assessment metric. Moreover, some papers have mentioned that none of simulation software is able to reproduce all of MAC layer control messages and <b>processing</b> <b>procedures,</b> {{as well as we}} found that any two simulation software do not implement the same control message types and <b>processing</b> <b>procedure.</b> Hence, it would be different for the performance expression of time-related evaluation metrics in different simulation software, e.g., the influence of packet delay time. In order to investigate how the management message <b>processing</b> <b>procedure</b> affects the time-related evaluation metrics, a system architecture should allow users to arbitrarily define his management message types and <b>processing</b> <b>procedure,</b> and then, we can obtain a more objective system performance evaluation results. Finally, to our knowledge, it often is incompatible for the operation interface of scheduling modules due to incorporation for the different scheduling factors and algorithms, which leads the studies inconvenience to evaluate the performance of various scheduling algorithms. Therefore, it would be helpful {{for the study of the}} scheduling algorithm selection, if the system architectures of schedule algorithm and operation interface can be independently developed.|$|R

30|$|In {{the virtual}} {{simulation}} world, time is advanced in a non-continuous way, and the advanced interval precision determines the required reality time. For saving reality time, {{we focus on}} the occurrence time of the specific event, called monitor time. We list all the event types that possibly occur at monitor time, which are enumerated in the event package. The <b>processing</b> <b>procedures</b> of all event types define a common execution interface, which consist of many sub-procedures, while the operating interface of these sub-procedures is defined in the event <b>processing</b> <b>procedure</b> package. The different types of devices may have the same type of events, but their <b>processing</b> <b>procedure</b> may be different; therefore, the execution details and steps of the sub-procedures are provided by the device class, i.e., the concept that “the event owner certainly has the ability to handle event.” We establish a chain of event types to accomplish a specific purpose to facilitate the management of the relationship among events and to mitigate the management problem caused by increasing the number of sub-procedures because the system quickly grows up, where the codes are independently in various sub-packages, that is how we implement the command flow way.|$|R

30|$|This package {{uses the}} {{interface}} class as super class and defines five basic operate interfaces, namely event identity code (EID), event owner (EO), event type (ET), trigger time (TT), and execution method (EM). EID {{is used to}} facilitate tracing the footprints of a specific event instance and convenience to monitor and debug. EO is responsible to provide the code entity of the event processing sub-procedure. ET is used to define event priority and the relationship among events. TT is used to sequentially perform event on time. EM is used to make all event types have a common interface method to perform their <b>processing</b> <b>procedure.</b> Under {{the different types of}} network topology, the same type events may trigger the same new events but having different owners, e.g., in transparent relay network, the users send the bandwidth request information to BS. After BS finishes the scheduling procedure, it informs the users to send data to tRS. However, in non-transparent relay network, the ntRS is responsible for the user all the request, scheduling, and grant procedures. In order to let the same type event have the different <b>processing</b> <b>procedures</b> with the different owners, we proposed a system architecture to allow that event type, <b>processing</b> <b>procedure,</b> and event owner can be developed and grow up independently to increase flexibility.|$|R
