500|$|Manson {{confirmed}} {{during his}} {{appearance at the}} 2010 Revolver Golden Gods Awards in April that the band had recorded 13 songs, and also {{expressed an interest in}} releasing the record in a different way from previous ones. Fred Sablan – guitarist for Twiggy's side-project Goon Moon – joined the band in July, and in October Twiggy described the upcoming album as being [...] "almost done", saying: [...] "It's our best record yet. I mean, everyone always says that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is our best work so far. It's kind of like a little more of a punk rock Mechanical Animals, without sounding too pretentious." [...] Manson attested that its lyrical content would be [...] "more romantic" [...] yet [...] "self-abusive", and described its sonic elements as being [...] "suicide death metal".|$|E
500|$|Veteran trainer Ginger McCain queried the {{suggestion}} of reducing {{the size of the}} fences {{in the aftermath of the}} race. McCain said: [...] "You don't make things better by making it easier. Its speed that does the damage." [...] Champion jockey Tony McCoy also defended the National, saying, [...] "I personally don't think the sport could be in any better shape for horses or jockeys." [...] Ornais's owner, Andy Stewart, later said: [...] "We're still grieving <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> whole hyped up situation regarding the Grand National is totally wrong... National Hunt racing is safer and compliant with every single sport that goes along. My son snowboarded in France and, unfortunately, he had an accident and he'll never walk again. Why don't we just get on with it and enjoy the sport?" ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{cultural}} reference {{appeared in}} a scene when Emma hears Leroy (who is actually Grumpy) whistling Whistle While You Work (the song used in the 1937 film version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), indicating its acknowledged ties to Disney, whose subsidiary ABC Studios {{also happens to be}} the production company behind Once Upon a Time, since Disney has allowed them access to their fairy tale characters and properties for use in the series. [...] "They've given us license," [...] Kitsis said. [...] "I could be wrong, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is the first time anyone's shown Snow White with a sword, or pregnant." [...] Other Disney references include the blue star candle Emma wishes on, nodding to the scene in the 1940 film version of Pinocchio where Pinocchio wishes on a blue star and his wish is granted by the Blue Fairy (both of whom also make a brief appearance alongside Jiminy Cricket in this episode).|$|E
5000|$|... "He'll be a sad loss <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> at <b>this</b> {{stage of}} his career it's {{important}} he plays football." [...] Blackpool assistant manager Steve Thompson following Jørgensen's release.|$|R
6000|$|... "Amos," [...] said De Catinat, [...] "I {{have spent}} my life among brave men, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>this</b> is the bravest man that I have ever met!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is all, Captain Bayley; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>this,</b> {{with what}} you have told me, is quite {{sufficient}} to bring the guilt home to the true party, and to completely clear Norris." ...|$|R
500|$|After {{writing songs}} with themes of {{independence}} for Control and social injustice for Rhythm Nation 1814, Jackson desired to devote {{her new album}} to love and relationships, describing the theme of her new album as [...] "intimacy" [...] and that [...] "exual communication {{is the name of}} the game." [...] She stated in an interview with David Wild for Rolling Stone that [...] "hile I was doing Rhythm Nation, I was thinking about how things were so hard, so regimented and so black and white... I thought I'd do something on the sexy side—which is hard for me since I grew up as a tomboy and don't really think of myself that way. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> album is more on the feminine tip." [...] She also commented on how her experience acting in Poetic Justice played a role in taking a new direction with her music. Speaking with biographer David Ritz, she stated that [...] "Rhythm Nation was a heavy record, and Poetic Justice was a heavy movie. I wanted to do something lighter but also daring... When I wrote the album, I was still in a poetic frame of mind, inspired by Maya's beautiful language. You can hear that inspiration or the interludes and especially on the song [...] "New Agenda". This time I felt much freer expressing myself." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{garnered}} {{a largely}} positive reception from critics. Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "Powerfully depicts both Mulder's gnawing sense of defeat and his bond with Scully, strangely growing stronger with separation" [...] before concluding that the episode was [...] "fairly standard." [...] The site ultimately gave the episode a B. Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club positively compared and contrasted the episode to the cartoon Scooby Doo, Where Are You? writing that, [...] "I {{used to be a}} huge [...] "Scooby Doo" [...] fan. [...] Of course, none of [...] were really monsters. [...] The X-Files exploited a simple truth: we all want to believe. We might be afraid of what's lurking in the dark, but isn't there always a bit of wishing inside that fear? A hope that what we think we know isn't everything there is to know. That just once it might be nice to reach for a zipper and instead find nothing but cool scales." [...] Handlen ultimately called the episode [...] "Essential." [...] Reviewer Dan Barrett from the 400 Club wrote that [...] "The X-Files is off to a stonking good start with this season 2 opening." [...] Bob Curtright, writing for the Los Angeles Daily News, called the episode [...] "an engrossing chiller about potential contact from outer space." [...] He compared the episode positively to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and noted that the episode was [...] "both scary and wondrous" [...] and [...] "offer no pat answers that might tend to blow the credibility." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, writing that the episode was not [...] "what the fans were expecting, and its reputation isn't great. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> clever and claustrophobic little take, which does so much not only to refresh the show but to analyze what it's actually about, is one of the very best." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nick Roman of Ricky.Org said: [...] "Once Upon a Time {{has dealt}} with LGBT romance before, but never with as much depth as we get here with “Ruby Slippers”. While you could make the {{argument}} that the show should be focusing more on the Hades story at this late stage of the season rather than a one-off story about Ruby's romance with Dorothy. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> episode illustrates why not every one-off story has to feel like filler.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} is time; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> always <b>think</b> <b>this</b> last talk before going upstairs, the best thing in the whole day!" [...] said the happy wife as she took the candle.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> {{you will}} find the n's and m's much bother; the contractions are the great nuisance. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>this</b> {{development}} of Gothic writing one of the oddest absurdities of mankind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Friend Andrew," [...] he said, [...] "you {{have set}} me a puzzle. You have set {{me a good}} many since I used to run errands for you at Eton, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>this</b> is the toughest." ...|$|R
2500|$|Healthy in Paranoid Times was {{met with}} mixed reviews. It was loved and hated by many critics who either called it the band's best work to date or their weakest. It was also called [...] "their most sonically mature album to date." [...] and their best album since Clumsy by Circle 6 Magazine. At the time, the band praised their own efforts on the album. Duncan Coutts said in an interview, [...] "I {{think this is the}} closest we've ever come to {{achieving}} what we heard in our heads and got on (record). For us this is the most complete record, start to finish. Some of the other records had awesome moments, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is as close as we feel we have gotten to getting a whole record exactly the way we wanted it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon parting with Interscope, Manson said [...] "a {{lot of the}} {{creative}} control on which my hands were tied [...] ", while stating that the band had been writing new material while touring their previous album. At the beginning of 2010, Vrenna {{said that they were}} [...] "talking and coming up with concepts" [...] for their upcoming studio album. Manson attested that its lyrical content would be [...] "more romantic" [...] yet [...] "self-abusive", and described its sonic elements as being [...] "suicide death metal". That April, Manson expressed interest in releasing the record in a different way from previous ones. Fred Sablan – bassist for Twiggy and Masters of Reality vocalist Chris Goss' project Goon Moon – joined the band in July. By October, Twiggy described the album as being [...] "almost done", and opined that [...] "It's our best record yet. I mean, everyone always says that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is our best work so far. It's kind of like a little more of a punk rock Mechanical Animals, without sounding too pretentious." [...] The following month, it was announced that the band had signed a joint-venture deal with London-based indie label Cooking Vinyl. As part of the deal, the band would retain creative control over their artistic direction, with the band and label sharing profits equally after the label recoups costs associated with marketing, promotion and distribution.|$|E
6000|$|We must to our oar; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> {{and another}} {{are all that}} even success would prompt me to write; and surely {{those that have been}} my {{defenders}} ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>this</b> {{new thing}} was coming up," [...] growled Jarvey. [...] "We were to share equal {{on what we}} {{happened}} {{to get out of}} the greasers. This is another thing entirely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} had much hope of doing anything, before, with the regulars in the forest, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> do <b>think,</b> <b>this</b> time, {{we have got a}} chance of licking the French. What do you say, captain?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have not}} the {{slightest}} doubt about {{the magnitude of the}} evils which accrue from the steady increase of European armaments; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>this</b> regrettable fact is merely the superficial expression of social forces, the operation of which cannot be sensibly affected by agreements between Governments.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Featherstone {{looked at}} him with gentle {{approval}} and her husband said, [...] "Lawrence has taken a very proper line; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> matter need not be spoken of again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forrest and I," [...] he remarked. [...] "Jolly low cutting, too. I {{have played}} against you often, Forrest, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> {{is our first}} rubber together. Here's good luck to us!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, nonsense! I wouldn't give a fig for {{all your}} politics, generally, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is {{something}} downright cruel and unchristian. I hope, my dear, no such law has been passed." ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Inspector General Earl Devaney gave {{testimony}} on his {{investigation of the}} MMS gifts scandal: [...] "I {{think there is a}} bar &#91;against corporations offering gifts&#93;, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> in <b>this</b> case a decision was made at the Department of Justice... to approach the oil and gas people in a different way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Edith," [...] he had said, [...] "you {{know that}} I am unwilling to oppose you; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that in <b>this</b> your {{feelings}} are carrying you too far." ...|$|R
6000|$|Foster hesitated. [...] "After all, {{it might}} be better to keep the police off Daly's track until I've seen him. He might make trouble for Lawrence if he was arrested, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>this</b> counts for much. You would be nearer the mark if you took it for granted that I'm {{naturally}} rash and can't resist a chance of adventure." ...|$|R
6000|$|And after Leonard's parting embrace to his favourite, she {{received}} it; and quickly overtaking the pensive {{steps of the}} lady, arrested her progress with, 'I beg your pardon, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is your dog.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now I feel better,' said Mrs Jo, as {{they all}} trooped down the hill soon after. 'Some of our boys are failures, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> {{one is going to}} be a success, and patient Daisy a happy girl at last. Nat is your work, Fritz, and I congratulate you heartily.' ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him with a happy smile. [...] "What should I fear? Aren't you {{able to take care of}} me? It must be for my sake that you are so timid and I love you for it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> must be the first time you ever hesitated long. Where has your usual {{recklessness}} gone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Right, Norman, {{that is what}} {{my father}} before me always said, and the way I have always acted myself; much better let a few trifles go on not just as one would wish, than be for ever interfering. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> really <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is a case for it, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> you ought to let {{yourself}} {{be influenced by the}} fear of any party-spirit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Her father!" [...] {{cried the}} lady, smiling. [...] "Nay; Maude {{is a good}} daughter, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was <b>this</b> young golden-haired squire of whom I have heard who has made her turn her back upon the world." ...|$|R
50|$|Now we have Jena Osman’s new book, An Essay in Asterisks, which I {{necessarily}} {{read with}} a more open mind, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is a much richer book than The Character, more generous in its pleasures. Here she is again probing consciousness and politics and language {{in a variety of}} inventive ways. These tricks might be called wordplay but the end is anything but playful.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are going}} out, mademoiselle. So am I. I will walk {{with you if}} you will allow me. I think the real thing has begun. The firing last night was only, I fancy, to rouse the Germans and make them pass as bad a night as our men were doing, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is the real thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Under your favour, Mr. Sprott," [...] said I, [...] "this {{young lady}} is come from Scotland seeking him, and by {{whatever}} mistake, {{was given the}} name of your house for a direction. An error it seems to have been, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> places both you and me--who am but her fellow-traveller by accident--under a strong obligation to help our countrywoman." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{give you}} this story as a just caution to a young tradesman, and to show how {{necessary}} it is that a tradesman should have judgment in the goods he buys, and how easily he may be imposed upon and abused, if he offers to buy upon his own judgment, when really it is defective. I could enlarge this article with many like examples, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> may suffice.|$|E
