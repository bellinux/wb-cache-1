50|$|Kepler also {{introduced}} {{a new form of}} texture handling known as bindless textures. Previously, textures needed to be bound by the CPU to a particular slot in a fixed-size table before the GPU could reference them. This led to two limitations: one was that because the table was fixed in size, there could only be as many textures in use at one time as could fit in this table (128). The second was that the CPU was doing unnecessary work: it had to load each texture, and also bind each texture loaded in memory to a slot in the <b>binding</b> <b>table.</b> With bindless textures, both limitations are removed. The GPU can access any texture loaded into memory, increasing the number of available textures and removing the performance penalty of binding.|$|E

30|$|Integrating Components with Compositions is {{accomplished}} by issuing a wireTo command to the node hosting the provided interface and a wireFrom command to the node hosting the required interface. This establishes the necessary routing entries in the <b>binding</b> <b>tables</b> of the Event Manager(s) and thus connects the two components. Wiring commands may specify a specific component ID, or may use wildcards to connect compatible interfaces that are provided by unknown components.|$|R
30|$|The LooCI event-bus is an asynchronous, event-based {{communication}} medium that promotes loosely coupled interactions. On the one hand, synchronization decoupling {{is provided by}} non-blocking interactions between components and the event bus. On the other hand, loose coupling in space is realized by separating distribution concerns from component implementation. LooCI components interact with the event bus via their provided and required interfaces, but have no knowledge about their communication partners. This information is stored in the binding tables of the Event Manager. A local <b>binding</b> <b>table</b> contains entries for bindings between local components, while a remote <b>binding</b> <b>table</b> contains entries for distributed bindings between a local and a remote component. The binding tables are therefore asymmetric. Bindings are only allowed between compatible interfaces and are generally defined by a <source event type, source component ID, source address, destination event type, destination component ID, destination address> tuple.|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the LMA must be {{involved}} in the inter-cluster handoff because the MN changes its cluster and connects to a new HMAG. In this study, MAG 1 and MAG 2 were assumed to be attached to HMAG 1 and HMAG 2, respectively. Once MAG 2 detects the MN attachment, it sends an LPBU to its HMAG 2. Once HMAG 2 receives the LPBU, it searches for a matched entry for MN in its <b>binding</b> <b>table.</b> Since the MN comes from another cluster, HMAG 2 will not find any entry for this specific MN. HMAG 2 then sends a PBU to the LMA to update the BCE of the MN. The LMA updates the HMAG field for the MN and replies via a PBA to the requesting HMAG 2. Once HMAG 2 receives the PBA, it creates an entry for the MN and replies by sending an LPBA back to the requesting MAG 2. The MAG 2 consequently creates the required entry for the MN in its <b>binding</b> <b>table</b> and advertises the HNP to the MN.|$|E
30|$|A LooCI binding is {{realised}} as an outgoing binding {{entry on}} the sending node and an incoming binding entry {{on the receiving}} node, which is established by issuing bindTo and bindFrom calls to the sender and receiver, respectively. These bindings are stored in a <b>binding</b> <b>table</b> {{which is used to}} dispatch events. LooCI bindings are created at runtime after the deployment of the involved components. High-priority binding is mediated by the transmission of a event using the network stack of the host operating system.|$|E
50|$|The use of cluster {{identifiers}} enforces {{the binding}} of complementary entities using the <b>binding</b> <b>tables,</b> which are maintained by zigbee coordinators, as the table {{must always be}} available within a network and coordinators {{are most likely to}} have a permanent power supply. Backups, managed by higher-level layers, may be needed by some applications. Binding requires an established communication link; after it exists, whether to add a new node to the network is decided, according to the application and security policies.|$|R
50|$|The {{application}} support sublayer (APS) {{is the other}} main standard component of the layer, and as such it offers a well-defined interface and control services. It works as {{a bridge between the}} network layer and the other elements of the application layer: it keeps up-to-date <b>binding</b> <b>tables</b> {{in the form of a}} database, which can be used to find appropriate devices depending on the services that are needed and those the different devices offer. As the union between both specified layers, it also routes messages across the layers of the protocol stack.|$|R

30|$|In the inter-cluster handoff, the MN {{movement}} is detected by another MAG located outside the cluster {{domain of the}} serving MAG. Thus, when the destination MAG accepts to register the MN, an LPBU message {{is sent to the}} respective HMAG including the MN-ID. However, the HMAG will not find the MN-ID in its <b>binding</b> <b>table</b> as the MN comes from another cluster. Therefore, the LMA must be involved in the process. This is done by the requesting HMAG sending a PBU message to the LMA advertising the new location of the MN. Subsequently, the LMA will update its BCE tables and send a reply to the requesting HMAG.|$|E

30|$|When the MN {{decides to}} move from its serving network to another within the CSPMIPv 6 domain, the MN {{movements}} could be either an intra- or inter-cluster handoff. In the intra-cluster handoff, the MN is supposed {{to move to another}} MAG within the same cluster domain. In other words, the MN movement is still controlled by the same cluster head HMAG. Therefore, the handover here is performed by the HMAG through updating its <b>binding</b> <b>table</b> without any intervention from the LMA. To do so, the destination MAG to which the MN decides to move, will send an LPBU message to the respective HMAG including the MN-ID. Here, the HMAG will only need to update its table by setting the new MAG address in its MAG field as opposed to the inter-cluster handoff. This is done once the MN information has already been recorded. Then, the respective HMAG sends back an LPBA message, including the HNP to the requesting MAG as well as configures the routing performed with the requesting MAG in order to forward the MN packets.|$|E

30|$|In our {{previous}} research, we {{proposed that the}} MRT-enabled routers can update their <b>binding</b> <b>tables</b> after receiving ICMP reply messages sent by the CN. The MRT-enabled routers can update their tables directly because payload in the ICMP echo reply message has already contained binding information. Unfortunately, the binding information can also be modified by a malicious ICMP message. This may cause severe consequence, regarding security problem. Thus, the ICMP message can only be used for triggering the MRT-enabled routers to update their binding information with the HA. Moreover, the binding update should be further protected by the secret key mechanism as explained in Section 4.1.|$|R
30|$|As {{defined in}} the RFC 792 [9], when a host or router cannot deliver a {{datagram}}, the datagram is discarded, and the host or router sends an ICMP destination-unreachable message back to the source host. The code field for this message specifies the reason for discarding the datagram. In this scheme, we use a special transport port number which is unused in well-known Internet services and is used only for the MRT discovery scheme. When the MN leaves its home network and visits a foreign network or receives a tunneled packet from the CN, the MN first sends a probe packet to the CN with a predefined and unused destination port number, for example, 10101. The probe packet is a general UDP message used to trigger CN to reply an ICMP destination-unreachable error report. Thus, The CN will issue an ICMP destination-unreachable message back to the MN with the code filed of ICMP message equal to 3 since the CN does not listen to that port number. The ICMP error message will {{be transferred to the}} HA. When the intermediate MRT-enabled routers receive an ICMP destination-unreachable message with the code equal to 3 and the destination port number of the original transport header equals the predefined number, they will issue an MRT binding request to the destination address of the ICMP message and try to update their <b>binding</b> <b>tables.</b> In other words, the ICMP destination-unreachable message is used to trigger the MRT-enabled routers to update their <b>binding</b> <b>tables.</b>|$|R
30|$|Once the HMAG k {{receives}} the LPBU message, the HMAG k fetches its <b>binding</b> <b>table</b> by {{searching for the}} HMN information. If the HMN moves to another MAG within the HMAG k cluster domain, which is as called intra-cluster handoff mobility, the HMAG k updates its Binding Cash Entry (BCE) by setting the New MAG (NMAG) address instead of the TMAG address in its MAG field. On the other hand, if the HMN moves to another MAG in a new HMAG (NHMAG) cluster domain within the CSPMIPv 6 domain, which is as called inter-cluster handoff mobility, the NHMAG will not find any matching entry in its BUL table. Since the HMN comes from another cluster, so the NHMAG sends PBU to the LMA to update its BCE for the HMN. Then, the HMAG field entry in the BCE of the LMA will be modified by setting the NHMAG address and releases the old one for the HMN. After that, the LMA replies to the NHMAG via sending a PBA message.|$|E
40|$|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) {{provides}} a means of allocating and managing IP addresses dynamically over a network. An important characteristic of the DHCP server is that different hosts or network cards {{are not allowed to}} simultaneously use the same IP address in the DHCP mechanism. However, anyone can guest corresponding parameters such as IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway from the DHCP mode, and then reconfigure a static IP to access the network from DHCP mode. According to the DHCP mechanism, this study traces abnormalities of the client IP or MAC address by comparing the ARP table and DHCP <b>binding</b> <b>table</b> in this paper. This work performs the proposed method to detect abnormal hosts on both DHCPv 4 and DHCPv 6. The difference between these two tables provides illegality information to transmit to relevant routers or switching devices via the DHCP server to block the illegal user from accessing network resources. This study approach requires no source address or MAC address retrieval of the packet. This work significantly improves system performance by effectively blocking illegal users before packets transmit. </p...|$|E
30|$|It is {{reported}} that bacterial allosteric l-LDHs consistently undergo the Monod-Wyman-Changeux-type (MWC-type: pre-existing type) (Monod et al. [1965]; Iwata et al. [1994]; Arai et al. [2010]) allosteric transition, where the active (R) state with high affinity to pyruvate and FBP, and the inactive (T) state with low affinity. However, such drastic structural changes {{appear to be}} unnecessary for the three d-LDHs, which exhibit apparently much smaller changes in catalytic activity due to the allosteric transition than the l-LDHs. In fact, the MWC model is not available for the case of PALDH, which shows negative homotropic cooperativity. In addition, FNLDH shows significant positive homotropic cooperativity also for NADH binding, which is less affected by FBP or Mg 2 + than pyruvate <b>binding</b> (<b>Table</b> 3), suggesting that FNLDH changes in its structure through two steps, the NADH binding and following pyruvate binding steps, in the allosteric transition. The Lactobacillus d-LDHs consistently have dimeric structure, whereas the three d-LDHs from Gram-negative bacteria have tetrameric structure. Thus, tetramerization might be correlated with the allostery of d-LDHs. It is highly desirable to determine the 3 D-structures of these d-LDHs.|$|E
30|$|As the GUID encodes the {{structure}} of the type system, it is significantly larger than the SHORT_ID, which is optimally compact. Therefore only the SHORT_ID is used when routing messages between interfaces: i.e., it is embedded in all messages and used in the <b>binding</b> <b>tables</b> of the Event Manager. On the other hand, GUIDs are only transmitted (i) with the component at deployment time, (ii) with introspection commands and responses to support discovery and (iii) with wiring commands to support type checking at bind-time. The overhead of the semantic type system at runtime can therefore be viewed as the overhead of transmitting additional type data and the computational overhead of compatibility testing.|$|R
30|$|CSPMIPv 6 is {{proposed}} {{to overcome the}} common disadvantages of PMIPv 6 and SPMIPv 6 by dividing the proxy domain {{into a number of}} local sub-domains. Each sub-domain is represented as a cluster that constitutes a group of MAGs with one Head MAG (HMAG), {{which is one of the}} PMIP MAGs that functions as a cluster head. HMAGs are selected during network installation and configuration. The method used for creating the optimum clusters is beyond the scope of this study. This section discusses the architecture, signaling, <b>binding</b> <b>tables,</b> and messages of the proposed CSPMIPv 6.

30|$|To provide IP {{mobility}} management, the IETF {{proposed and}} released the Mobile Internet Protocol IPv 4 (MIPv 4) [16, 17]. The home agent (HA), foreign agent (FA), mobile node (MN), corresponding node (CN), care of address (CoA), visitor list (VL), and mobility <b>binding</b> <b>table</b> (MBT) network entities were introduced by MIPv 4 protocol. HA {{is responsible for}} keeping the MN reachable when it moves in the Internet in the same domain and keeping their mobility information in MBT. A foreign agent {{is located in the}} foreign domain which supports the moving MN. When the MN reaches a foreign domain, the foreign domain assigns a CoA (temporary address based on the current position of the MN) to the MN and keeps the information of arriving MN in its VL and informs the HA about the MN movements. Then, the entry information on the local MBT will be updated by HA. CN is the mobile host being either in static or mobile node that communicates with the MN. As a result of the short range of IP address and high burden of network entity adverted, the Mobile Internet IPv 6 (MIPv 6) [18] and network mobility (NEMO) approach [19] were proposed by the IETF. This was done to overcome the aforementioned problems in MIPv 4. However, the MIPv 6 and NEMO protocols are not efficient for critical applications (real-time applications), due to high handover latency, packet ratio loss and signaling overhead [20].|$|E

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of the peer-to-peer paradigm in the world of software, a lot of applications have been created in order to such architecture. Most of them are developed for providing a data sharing service among users connected to a network and programs such as Napster, Gnutella, eMule and BitTorrent have became the so called killer-applications. However some eorts have been spent in order to develop other solutions with the usage of peer-to-peer paradigm. In the case of databases some projects are started with the general purpose of sharing data sets with other databases. Generally they push on the idea of providing the data contained in their database schemes with other peers in the network showing concepts such schema matching, mapping tables and others which are necessary to establish connections and data sending. The thesis analyzes some of such projects in order to see which of them is the most dened and well-supported by concepts and deni- tions. Hyperion Project of the University of Torono in collaboration with the University of Trento is the most promising and it aims {{to be one of the}} rst Peer-to-Peer Database Management Systems. However the common idea of considering the peer-to-peer paradigm equal to data sharing - in the way presented by applications such as Napster or others - leads to a lot diculties, it is hard to handle the data sets, some operations must be done manually and there can be some cases where the peer-to-peer paradigm is not applied at all. For this reason the goal is to dene and show the concept of peer-to-peer database built from the scratch with a suitable DBMS for it. A real denition of peer-to-peer database has not been ever made and here for the rst time we tried to give one according to our vision. The denition depends on some precise concepts such global schema - which is the original design of the database -, sub-schema - a well logical dened sub-set of entities of the original schema - and <b>binding</b> <b>tables</b> - necessary to allow the creation of constraints and relations among the entities. Then to show the validity of such concepts and how a management system for peer-to-peer databases can be developed and used, a prototype (named Dionysius) has been realized by modifying HSQLDB - an ordinary DBMS developed in Java - and adding the peer-to-peer platform by using the JXTA libray set...|$|R

MacBeath’s group developed a forward-phase assay using Microarrays In Microtiter plates (MIMs) technology, in which a virtually complete set of human SH 2 and PTB domains was immobilized in microarrays aligned with the wells of a 96 -well plate, thereby allowing simultaneous probing of multiple microarrays (Jones et al., 2006).

Panomics has introduced a conceptually similar membrane-based SH 2 domain macro-array with 34 SH 2 domains, and described its use for phosphorylated peptides, recombinant proteins and cell lysates (Panomics). Taking advantage of the Luminex fluorescent bead technology, this group also reported a forward-phase bead-based assay in which different SH 2 domains are conjugated to microspheres with distinct fluorophore labels.

Suddenly, parameters recorded daily, {{as a means of}} quality control, were ob-served to change. Since no new techniques in handling the kit had been introduced and preparation of kit rea-gents was confirmed to be consistent with the manufac-turer's protocol, the assay itself became ·suspect. Using a representative time period prior to the observed change, comparisons of data were made:from complete daily records. Investigating several parameters in light of radioimmunoassay principles, a probable cause was determined. Materials and Methods The digoxin kit used required a 30 -min incubation of 125 1 -digoxin derivative with patient serum and antibody followed by a 5 -min adsorption of unbound digoxin onto dextran-coated charcoal (DCC), centrifugation at 4, 000 g for 10 min at 40 °C, decantation, and assessment of radioactivity in the antibody-bound fraction. Com-puterized data handling and standard curve-fitting tech-niques were employed. The quality control program, in-cluding records of percent total binding (%B/T), per-cent bound of the 0 ngfml standard (% 80), and high and low digoxin level reference serums assayed daily, aided in determining the validity of each run. Toxic ranges were considered to be above 2. 5 ngfml with a minimum detectable dose of 0. 4 ngfml. Observations In mid-November 1974, a drop in %B/T across the assay range was noted.

We have performed a number of in vitro and in vivo tests [i. e., estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor binding assays, thyroid hormone receptor binding assays, human breast cancer cell line MCF- 7 proliferation assays (E-SCREEN), uterotrophic assays in immature and ovariectomized rats, Hershberger assays, and prolactin release assays and steroidogenesis] and found no effects of styrene dimers or trimers on sex hormones in any of these assays (2 – 7). These results are supported by Fail et al.

In addition, the Japan Environment Agency referred to their studies (9) and removed the styrene dimers and trimers from their list of endocrine disruptors (9). However, Ohyama et al.

The present study also revealed that mTOR-inhibition decreases the phosphorylation in eIF 5 B. To explore effects of Ser 214 phosphorylation on eIF 5 B functions, we used the CRISPR-cas 9 technology to knockdown the expression of eIF 5 B, showing that the expression level of eIF 5 B in eIF 5 B-knockdown cells was one third {{of that in the}} control cells as determined by qPCR (Fig. S 3). Then, plasmids containing the wildtype eIF 5 B, and two mutants eIF 5 B-S 214 A and eIF 5 B-S 214 E were transiently transfected into the eIF 5 B-knockdown cells, respectively, followed by immunoprecipitation to identify the binding partners of eIF 5 B and mutants. The mRNA level and protein expression of wild type eIF 5 B and two mutants were detected by qPCR, Western blotting and mass spectrometry, as shown in Figs. S 3, S 4 and S 5. The binding partners of the wild type eIF 5 B and two mutants were identified by label free quantification (LFQ) using the MaxQuant software. When a protein was only present in the eIF 5 B immunoprecipitated complex or the total ion intensity of corresponding tryptic peptides from one protein identified in the eIF 5 B immunoprecipitated complex is five times higher than that in the FLAG-only immunoprecipitated complex, this protein was considered as the binding partner of eIF 5 B. Forty five <b>binding</b> partners (<b>Table</b> S 4) of the wild type eIF 5 B were identified in two independent biological replicates and the interactome was analyzed using STRING software ([URL] (Fig. S 6). To understand the biological relevance of these proteins, the Gene Ontology (GO) was used to cluster proteins according to their associated biological processes. The annotations of gene lists were summarized via a pie plot based on KEGG pathway analysis as shown in Fig.  2 B. Eighty percent of eIF 5 B-binding proteins participated in the genetic information processing, including ribosome biogenesis, messenger RNA biogenesis and spliceosome. In comparing to proteins binding to the wild type eIF 5 B, several proteins were found to preferentially bind to eIF 5 B-S 214 E mutant, but not eIF 5 B-S 214 A mutant as displayed in Fig.  2 C. These proteins were considered to have the higher affinity to Ser 214 -phosphorylated eIF 5 B. Among them, N-acetyltransferase 10 (Nat 10), a RNA acetyltransferase, is responsible for 18 S rRNA processing through inducing N 4 -acetylcytidine formation (Ito et al., 2014). The Nat 10 -eIF 5 B interaction was verified by reciprocal immunoprecipitation (Fig.  2 D) and eIF 5 B was immunoprecipitated by Nat 10 -specific antibody in Nat 10 -transfected 293 T cells. Using PRM-based targeted mass spectrometry, we found that the ratio of the phosphorylated Ser 214 -containing peptide to the unphosphorylated peptide in the Nat 10 -immunoprecipitated eIF 5 B was 3 times higher than that in eIF 5 B from 293 T cells, which confirmed that Nat 10 preferred to bind to Ser 214 phosphorylated eIF 5 B (Fig.  2 E). It was reported that the mTOR pathway involved in rRNA maturation with unknown mechanism (Iadevaia et al., 2012). Our results suggested that mTOR phosphorylated eIF 5 B to enhance the binding of eIF 5 B with Nat 10 and to promote rRNA processing.|$|R
40|$|In our {{continuous}} {{search for}} plant secondary metabolites that bind to CB and/or opioid receptors, we selected four extracts that showed interesting affinity versus the above mentioned receptors. In particular: the DCM extract {{obtained from the}} aerial parts of Stachys glutinosa (SGE) was able to bind with a good affinity both MOR and DOR with a Ki of 10. 3 and 9 μg/mL, respectively while the DCM extract from the leaves of Otanthus maritimus (OME) showed good binding affinity to CB 1 (Ki = 2. 2 μg/mL) and CB 2 (Ki = 1. 3 μg/mL) and moderate affinity to MOR and DOR. The third was an alkaloid fraction obtained from the MeOH extract of the roots of Withania somnifera (WSAE) that displayed appreciable affinity versus DOR (Ki = 25. 5 μg/mL), CB 1 (Ki = 23. 5 μg/mL), CB 2 (Ki = 20. 3 μg/mL) and GABAA (Ki = 14 μg/mL). The in toto MeOH extract (WSE) bound with very low affinity to CB and opioid receptors but displayed interesting affinity to GABAA receptors (Ki = 14 μg/mL) Based on this results this study, carried out {{in collaboration with the}} group of Dr. Stefania Ruiu of CNR-­‐Institute of Translational Pharmacology of Cagliari, aimed to: 1. Isolate the secondary metabolites that were responsible of the observed binding affinity 2. Identify the compounds by spectrometric and spectroscopic methods 3. Evaluate the binding affinity of the isolated metabolites to opioid and cannabinoid receptors. 4. Evaluate the most potent and abundant compounds in antinociceptive experiments in mice. A total of 30 secondary metabolites were isolated from the extracts. Two semisynthetic derivatives were also prepared. The OME yielded two new alkylamides and one new neo-­‐lignan, along with thirteen known compounds. Among the constituents identified, 1 -­‐[(2 E, 4 E, 8 Z) -­‐tetradecatrienoyl]piperidine was the most potent binder to both CB 1 and CB 2 receptors with a Ki value of 0. 8 M and 0. 16 M, respectively. The molecular modeling approaches applied in this study put in evidence, important requirements for the activity of this series of compounds and gives several hints for the design of optimized CB 2 ligands. From the SGE one new neo-­‐clerodane, 3, 4 α-­‐epoxyroseostachenol along four known flavones (eupatilin, sideritoflavone, xanthomicrol, and 8 -­‐methoxycirsilineol) and one neo-­‐clerodane diterpene (roseostachenone), were isolated. In order to find a structure-­‐activity relationships, two metoxyflavones (5 -­‐demethyltangeretin, and tangeretin) were synthesized by methoxylation of xanthomicrol. Our results showed that xanthomicrol, the main constituent of S. glutinosa aerial parts (2 % of the dried extract) is the principal responsible of the observed opioid binding affinities of the extract, with a Ki value of 0. 825 μM to μ opioid receptor. Since the μ receptor is thought to be primarily responsible for the mediation of opioid anti-­‐nociception, we evaluated the anti-­‐ nociceptive activity of xanthomicrol in the tail flick test. Our data demonstrated that pretreatment of xanthomicrol inhibited morphine-­‐induced anti-­‐nociception in the tail flick test, suggesting an antagonistic effect at μ opioid receptor. As regards WSE and WSAE, the results of the <b>binding</b> assays (<b>Table</b> 10) for the μ, CB and GABAA receptors suggested a possible anti-­‐nociceptive effect of W. somnifera. Starting from these preliminar data and from previous studies demonstrating that Withania somnifera prevented the development of tolerance to the analgesic effect of morphine, 166 using behavioral appoaches we demonstrate {{for the first time the}} ability of WSE pre-­‐treatment to prolong analgesia and to prevent the development of rebound hyperalgesia in mice treated with morphine...|$|R
