5000|$|Sight setter : [...] Operates {{the sight}} setting equipment. In single mounts, he stands {{just behind the}} trainer (See the man with {{headphones}} in the Mk21 open mount picture), while in twin mounts he sits between the guns, just forward of the projectile hoists. The sight setter moves the sights' reticles relative to the <b>barrel's</b> <b>axis.</b> In early open mounts, this was done by moving the platforms to which the sights were bolted. Sights in enclosed mounts have movable prisms in their optical paths. [...] The sight setter has three dials, and two hand cranks. (pictured) The two right dials and right hand crank control the elevation reticle offset (called Sight Angle). The upper right dial is scaled in minutes of arc, and the lower right dial is in yards. The left dial and hand crank control the reticle's left and right offset (called Sight Deflection), and the dial is scaled in angular mils. When the mount is in Automatic Control, he turns his hand cranks to keep index marks on his dials matched to lines on the central disks of the dials. These disks are electrically controlled by the Fire Control System by synchro. This is called matching the pointers, and it allows the sights {{to remain on the}} target while the mount is controlled by the Fire Control System. In local control, he takes sighting orders from the Mount Captain in yards of range and mils of deflection.|$|R
500|$|The {{periscopic}} sights (the {{boxes on}} the side of the mount) allowed the trainer and pointer to see the target from inside the armored enclosure. Each sight had movable prisms that allowed its line of sight to be moved relative to the <b>barrel's</b> bore <b>axis.</b> These prisms could be controlled by the fire control system when the mount was in Automatic, or by the mount's sight setter operator when the mount was in Local. [...] Local control was not the preferred combat method, but it could be used if the fire control systems were damaged. The mount captain was trained in aiming and correcting the fall of shot.|$|R
50|$|The Canadian M203A1 by Diemaco (now Colt Canada) is {{a similar}} design with a {{different}} mounting system that does not require mounting points of the same profile as the M16A1 rifle's. The weapon's 9-inch barrel slides further forward than the standard American models, which allows longer rounds to be loaded. This model is identifiable by the increased distance between the grenade launcher's <b>barrel</b> <b>axis</b> and the rifle's. This weapon {{may no longer be}} in production, but is still in use.|$|E

50|$|The Caracal is a fully ambidextrous polymer framed pistol that {{features}} an ergonomically designed grip with a rounded butt and a grip angle of 111°. The lower forward {{edge of the}} frame has a mounting-bracket or rail interface system for mounting accessories.The pistol's low slide profile design holds the pistol <b>barrel</b> <b>axis</b> close to the shooter's hand and makes the pistols more comfortable to shoot by reducing muzzle rise and allows faster aim recovery in rapid shooting sequence. The distance from the pistol barrel central axis {{to the top of}} the grip is 18 mm. This low bore axis principle is also found in the Glock, Steyr M and in the later developed Arsenal Firearms Strike One pistols.|$|E
40|$|The {{intended}} aim {{of studies}} on the modelling of a bullet interacting with a barrel is to generate a virtual, computer-based model, experimentally verified for some selected mating conditions, and to become able to predict – with strong probability – processes and phenomena that take place within a system with imperfections. In the case under consideration the problem of contact between the barrel and the bullet has been described with the calculation method based on the penalty function. Calculations were made using the so-called direct-integration procedure, colloquially called the,,explicit integration”. Preliminary analysis {{has been carried out}} on the effect of the shift of the centre of mass of the bullet moving in the barrel. Simulation included the bullet displacement along the <b>barrel’s</b> <b>axis,</b> with the assumed positions of the centre of mass – 5 % and + 5 % as measured from the bottom and referred to the initial model (0 %). Results of numerical calculations suggest the effect of shift of the bullet’s centre of mass, which-when exposed to complex states of loading- experiences oscillating movements of the bottom and the tip. Additionally, this analysis proves that there is a complex state of stress due to compression, torsion, and bending of the bullet while interacting with the inner part of the barrel. Numerical solutions may support the analytically approached solving of such mechanical system. They may also offer more precise determination of, e. g. initial and boundary conditions for the bullet’s free flight, which is of great significance to the accuracy of fire, and therefore, to the weapon...|$|R
50|$|On firearms, bipods are {{commonly}} used on rifles and machine guns to provide a forward rest and reduce motion. They are also seen on other long-barrelled weapons. Bipods permit operators to easily rest a weapon on objects, like the ground or a wall, reducing their fatigue and increasing accuracy and stability. Bipods can be of fixed or adjustable length. Some can be tilted and also have their tilting point close to the <b>barrel's</b> central <b>axis,</b> allowing the weapon to tilt left and right. Some designs also allow the weapon to be rotated side-to-side. There are three ways for bipods to be folded: away from the shooter, towards the shooter, or into a vertical foregrip.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "ball detent" [...] is {{also used}} when {{referring}} to a mechanism in paintball markers designed to prevent the [...] paintball from rolling out of the firing chamber before being fired. Some designs {{are similar to those}} outlined above, with a cartridge utilizing a ball bearing in a bore with spring pressure. The cartridge is installed perpendicular to the <b>barrel</b> bore <b>axis,</b> just ahead of where the ball rests before being fired. Other designs use elastic rubber protrusions that block the ball until it is pushed over it by the bolt. Some designs use precisely calibrated rings or [...] "barrel sizers" [...] that are selected to have a slightly smaller inner diameter than the outer diameter of the paintballs being used. They rely on simple constriction of the bore to prevent paintballs from rolling through them from the force of gravity. When the marker is fired, the air pressure pushes the ball through the bore, causing it to compress enough to pass through. Paintballs have varying diameters depending on a number of factors; this type of ball detent must be sized correctly to avoid compressing the paintball too much, causing it to burst. If a too large sizer is selected, balls may roll through it.|$|R
5000|$|The Glock pistol has a {{relatively}} low slide profile, which holds the <b>barrel</b> <b>axis</b> close to the shooter's hand and makes the pistol more comfortable to fire by reducing muzzle rise and allows for faster aim recovery in rapid firing sequences.The rectangular slide is milled from a single block of ordnance-grade steel using CNC machinery. The barrel and slide undergo two hardening processes prior to treatment with a proprietary nitriding process called Tenifer. The Tenifer treatment is applied in a [...] nitrate bath. The Tenifer finish is between 0.04 and 0.05 mm in thickness, and is characterized by extreme resistance to wear and corrosion; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth.|$|E
50|$|In 1925, Rodolfo Cosmi {{produced}} the first working hybrid prototype semi-automatic shotgun, which had an 8-round magazine {{located in the}} stock. While it reloaded automatically after each shot like a semi-automatic, it had a break-action to load the first shell. This design has only been repeated once, by Beretta with their UGB25 automatic shotgun. The user loads the first shell by breaking the gun {{in the manner of}} a break-action shotgun, then closes it and inserts the second shell into a clip on the gun's right side. The spent hulls are ejected downwards. The guns combine the advantages of the break action (they can be proven to be safe by breaking open, there are no flying hulls) with those of the semi-automatic (low recoil, low <b>barrel</b> <b>axis</b> position hence low muzzle flip).|$|E
50|$|The pistol {{frame is}} made out of Zytel polymer {{reinforced}} with a stainless steel chassis. The pistol comes with three removable and interchangeable grips.The slide and barrel are made out of stainless steel that after hardening is treated with a proprietary nitriding process called Melonite. The Melonite process produces a matte gray non-glare surface with a 68 Rockwell C surface hardness rating.The pistol has a very low slide profile which holds the <b>barrel</b> <b>axis</b> close to the shooter's hand and makes the M&P more comfortable to shoot by reducing muzzle rise and allowing for faster aim recovery in rapid shooting sequence.The slide has four contact points with the frame. This was done to make the rail system self cleaning, by leaving room for any dirt or small foreign objects to fall out of the weapon.|$|E
50|$|The KRISS Vector {{uses the}} KRISS Super V Recoil Mitigation System, {{that is an}} {{articulated}} mechanism which allows the bolt and an inertia block to move downward into a recess behind the magazine well. The theory {{is that at the}} end of this travel, the energy is transmitted downward rather than rearward, thus reducing the felt recoil. When fired, the <b>barrel</b> <b>axis</b> is in line with the shoulder as in the M16 rifle, but also in line with the shooter's hand. This is intended to reduce muzzle climb when combined with the off-axis bolt travel, though it also greatly raise the sight line in comparison to the bore axis. The initial prototype model by TDI achieved a rate of fire of 1,500 rounds per minute (RPM), though this was bought down to around 1,200 rounds per minute (RPM) on the production models.|$|E

5000|$|As the manufacturers' product page states:The revolvers of cal. 357 Magnum {{have been}} {{designed}} to comply requirements of demanding users from among the law enforcing corps, private security agencies and citizens who take their safety seriously. The design of cartridge cylinder mounting in tilting console and shock transition control from the console to the frame considers as much as possible maintaining the minimum limits for a long time. Cylinder rotation design takes no compromise in forcing the cylinder turn by exact spacing distance to safely adjust to the barrel leaving no reckon on inertia of the cylinder to finish its turning movement. The user obtains thus a guarantee of safe action disabled when the cartridge is off the <b>barrel</b> <b>axis</b> even if the cylinder is braked, e.g. with impurities. The combination of 357 Magnum cartridge high output and our revolver makes up a reliable arms system for any crisis situation. Drop safety and all-steel design guarantee a high level of safety when carried under any condition. The accuracy and power of the six-inch version is a challenge for hunters using short guns.|$|E
50|$|The {{machine gun}} feeds from the {{left-hand}} side {{through a variety}} of disintegrating ammunition belt types: the American M13 linked belt, the German DM6 counterpart to the M13 or the segmented German DM1 belt. The ratcheting wheel feed unit was designed as an easily removable module that is inserted into the bottom portion of the feed block (installed in place of the standard magazine well), below the <b>barrel</b> <b>axis.</b> As a result of this configuration (the bolt passes over the belt), the ammunition belt is aligned upside down compared to most other belt-fed weapons (that is, the links face downward). The feed mechanism is actuated by the reciprocating movement of the bolt; a curved cam slot {{on the bottom of the}} bolt engages an actuator in the feed mechanism, rotating the double sprockets and positioning a new round in the feed path. Simple conversion from belt to magazine feed is possible by installing an adapter in the feed block which enables the use of H&K’s proprietary 20-round box magazine (from the G3 rifle) or a 50-round drum magazine. The HK21 uses a modified G3 receiver that has been extended to the front sight base and is equipped with a detachable bipod (mounted either in front of the feed mechanism or at the muzzle) and tripod and vehicle mounting points. The HK21 has close to a 48% parts interchangeability with the G3.|$|E
40|$|Two VDAC (voltage-dependent anion-selective channel) isoforms were {{purified}} {{from seed}} cotyledons of Phaseolus vulgaris by chromatofocusing chromatography. Attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy {{was used to}} study the structural properties of the two isoforms reconstituted {{in a mixture of}} asolectin and 5 % stigmasterol. The IR spectra of the two VDAC isoforms were highly similar indicating 50 to 53 % anti-parallel beta-sheet. The orientation of the beta-strands relative to the <b>barrel</b> <b>axis</b> was calculated from the experimentally obtained dichroic ratios of the amide I beta-sheet component and the amide II band. Comparing the IR spectra of the reconstituted VDAC isoforms with the IR spectra of the bacterial porin OmpF, for which a high resolution structure is available, provided evidence for a general structural organization of the VDAC isoforms similar to that of bacterial porins. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange measurements indicated that the exchange of the amide protons occurs to a higher extent in the two VDAC isoforms than in the OmpF porin.

40|$|The {{electrostatic}} {{properties of}} seven alpha/beta-barrel enzymes selected from different evolutionary families were studied: triose phosphate isomerase, fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate aldolase, pyruvate kinase, mandelate racemase, trimethylamine dehydrogenase, glycolate oxidase, and narbonin, a protein without any known enzymatic activity. The {{backbone of the}} alpha/beta-barrel has a distinct electrostatic field pattern, which is dipolar along the <b>barrel</b> <b>axis.</b> When the side chains {{are included in the}} calculations the general effect is to modulate the electrostatic pattern so that the electrostatic field is generally enhanced and is focused into a specific area near the active site. We use the electrostatic flux through a square surface near the active site to gauge the functionally relevant magnitude of the electrostatic field. The calculations reveal that in six out of the seven cases the backbone itself contributes greater than 45 % of the total flux. The substantial electrostatic contribution of the backbone correlates with the known preference of alpha/beta-barrel enzymes for negatively charged substrates...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn polytopic α-helical transmembrane proteins, the {{distribution}} of amide vibrational transition moments can be nonaxial, if the helix axes are tilted relative to the symmetry axis of the helix bundle. The infrared dichroic ratios from oriented samples then contain nonaxial terms and, in the most general case, require a second-order parameter for the axis of the helix bundle. The extent of nonaxiality depends on the summation over the individual amide transition moments along the helix. Because this is strongly oscillatory, with a 3. 6 -residue periodicity, complete axial symmetry is not achieved rapidly on progressive summation. Expressions for the contributions of residual nonaxiality to the dichroic ratios are derived. A similar situation arises for oligomers of transmembrane β-barrel proteins, e. g., the porin trimer. In this case, the extent of nonaxiality depends {{not only on the}} number of residues in the β-barrel, but also on the tilt of the β-strands relative to the <b>barrel</b> <b>axis</b> and the characteristic dimensions of a β-sheet, which together determine the axial periodicity.

40|$|AbstractThe β-barrels {{found in}} the outer {{membranes}} of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms constitute an important functional class of proteins. Here we present solid-state NMR spectra of the bacterial outer membrane protein OmpX in oriented lipid bilayer membranes. We show that OmpX is folded in both glass-supported oriented lipid bilayers and in lipid bicelles that can be magnetically oriented with the membrane plane parallel or perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} magnetic field. The presence of resolved peaks in these spectra demonstrates that OmpX undergoes rotational diffusion around an axis perpendicular to the membrane surface. A tightly hydrogen-bonded domain of OmpX resists exchange with D 2 O for days and is assigned to the transmembrane β-barrel, while peaks at isotropic resonance frequencies that disappear rapidly in D 2 O are assigned to the extracellular and periplasmic loops. The two-dimensional 1 H/ 15 N separated local field spectra of OmpX have several resolved peaks, and agree well with the spectra calculated from the crystal structure of OmpX rotated with the <b>barrel</b> <b>axis</b> nearly parallel (5 ° tilt) to the direction of the magnetic field.
