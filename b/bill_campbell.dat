5|$|The Rocketeer is a 1991 American period superhero {{adventure}} {{film from}} Walt Disney Pictures, produced by Charles Gordon, Lawrence Gordon, and Lloyd Levin, directed by Joe Johnston, that stars <b>Bill</b> <b>Campbell,</b> Jennifer Connelly, Alan Arkin, Timothy Dalton, Paul Sorvino, and Tiny Ron Taylor. The film {{is based upon}} the character of the same name created by comic book artist and writer Dave Stevens. Set in 1938 Los Angeles, California, The Rocketeer tells the story of stunt pilot Cliff Secord who stumbles upon a hidden rocket powered jet pack that he thereafter uses to fly without the need of an aircraft. His heroic deeds soon attract the attention of Howard Hughes and the FBI, who are hunting for the missing jet pack, as well as the Nazi operatives that stole it from Hughes.|$|E
5|$|The Cubs' closer for 1981, Dick Tidrow, had a 3–10 {{season with}} a 5.06 ERA, and as a result, in 1982 Smith, Willie Hernández and <b>Bill</b> <b>Campbell</b> shared closing duties. Smith pitched well and even started five games from mid-June to early July. Significantly, former Cubs star pitcher Ferguson Jenkins {{returned}} to the team in 1982, and became {{a major influence on}} the young reliever; Smith credited Jenkins with simplifying his delivery, introducing him to the slider and forkball, and teaching him how to set up hitters. In what would be the last start of his career, Smith picked up his first major league hit, a home run off eventual Hall of Famer Phil Niekro. Smith managed only two singles {{for the rest of his}} career. He saved 17 games during that season and performed as the regular closer for the Cubs, a position he held for the next five years.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural award {{winners were}} <b>Bill</b> <b>Campbell</b> (AL) and Rawly Eastwick (NL); Campbell also {{won in the}} {{following}} season. Dan Quisenberry and Mariano Rivera each won the AL award five times, while Rollie Fingers and Bruce Sutter won the award four times each. Lee Smith won the award on three occasions; Campbell, Dennis Eckersley, Dave Righetti, John Franco, Éric Gagné, Randy Myers, Trevor Hoffman, Francisco Rodríguez, Heath Bell, and José Valverde each won the award twice. Sutter (NL 1979), Fingers (AL 1981), Steve Bedrosian (NL 1987), Mark Davis (NL 1989), Eckersley (AL 1992), and Éric Gagné (NL 2003) won the Relief Man and the Cy Young Award in the same season; Fingers and Eckersley won the AL MVP as well, in 1981 and 1992 respectively. Todd Worrell won both the Relief Man and the MLB Rookie of the Year Award in the 1986 MLB season. Rivera and Joe Nathan were the only relief pitchers to have tied in points for the award, and both were awarded in 2009. Goose Gossage, Fingers, Eckersley, and Sutter were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Craig Kimbrel (NL) and Jim Johnson (AL) were the final award winners in 2012. Sanofi acquired Rolaids from Johnson & Johnson unit McNeil Consumer Healthcare in 2013, but the award was not continued {{as a part of}} its marketing strategy.|$|E

25|$|The Cubs {{struggled}} in Cactus League action, so Green began {{to rebuild the}} team before it left Mesa. Green began by releasing Ferguson Jenkins, who was just 16 games shy of winning 300 games. Jenkins' release ended the right-hander's second stint with the Cubs, and effectively, his career. Green's biggest move of the spring came on March 26, when he sent journeyman reliever <b>Bill</b> <b>Campbell</b> and catcher Mike Diaz to Philadelphia for pitcher Porfi Altamirano and outfielders Gary Matthews and Bob Dernier.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Davis {{ran against}} six other contenders in his race for State Controller; {{several of those}} candidates, {{including}} Democrat John Garamendi and Republican <b>Bill</b> <b>Campbell,</b> were arguably better known at the time. Davis served as State Controller for eight years until 1995. As California's chief fiscal officer, he saved taxpayers {{more than half a}} billion dollars by cracking down on Medi-Cal fraud, rooting out government waste and inefficiency and exposing the misuse of public funds. He was the first controller to withhold paychecks from all state elected officials, including himself, until the governor and the Legislature passed an overdue budget. He also found and returned more than $1.8 billion in unclaimed property to California citizens, including forgotten bank accounts, insurance settlements and stocks.|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, Luke McManus of RTÉ {{compared}} its {{songs to}} [...] "those jazzy Beastie Boys tracks", {{and described the}} sound as [...] "undemanding and smooth".

[...] Bryan Carroll of Allmusic criticized the predominance of [...] "mood pieces", and stated, [...] "on the whole Soul Food Taqueria fails {{to stick to the}} ribs because it simply lacks the proper spice". Other critics cited Guerrero's simple, inventive style and sound for the album as one of its better qualities. <b>Bill</b> <b>Campbell</b> of Ink 19 called the album an [...] "exemplary album ... 100% soul". He also commended Guerrero's musicality, [...] "he constructs heartfelt music with a complexity few can pull off successfully", as well as his guitar playing, as Campbell wrote [...] "his guitar work is subtle and works the spaces between the beats marvelously".|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, the Atlanta Housing Authority first {{announced}} plans for the [...] "Historic Westside Village", a $130 million commercial, residential and retail project at the area's southern end near Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. at Ashby St. A Publix supermarket opened in May 2002 but the overall project stalled by 2003 as further anchor tenants did not materialize.

500|$|Keyes {{was also}} {{especially}} critical of Pat Buchanan, once saying {{during an interview}} on the Talk from the Heart program with Al Kresta (simulcast on KJSL St. Louis and WMUZ Detroit) that Buchanan had a [...] "black heart." [...] Keyes's entry into the Republican race after Buchanan had secured victories in New Hampshire and Louisiana led many to believe that Keyes was a stalking horse for neoconservative elements in the Republican Party, since Buchanan had been a well-known ardent foe of abortion and had suffered political fallout for bringing abortion and [...] "cultural war" [...] {{to the center of}} the public policy debate. [...] Later during the primaries, Keyes was briefly detained by Atlanta police when he tried to force his way into a debate to which he had been invited, and then uninvited.

500|$|For years, {{the belief}} {{was that the}} final 46seconds of the game were not played after Chamberlain scored his 100th point due to the celebration on the court; Chamberlain himself was quoted as having made that claim. However, {{recordings}} from the WCAU radio broadcast include announcer <b>Bill</b> <b>Campbell</b> resuming his play-by-play call after Chamberlain's 100th point and calling the game to its conclusion. By Gary M. Pomerantz |publisher=Crown Publishing Group (Random House)}} [...] (The web page's interactive audio broadcast of the game uses Adobe Flash Player.) A copy of the radio broadcast of the game was only uncovered in 1988. WCAU's original game tape had been recorded over by one of its engineers, a standard practice in those days. However, a Philadelphian had recorded with a Dictaphone part of Campbell's coverage in the fourth quarter, but only the Warriors possessions. Two years later, a reel-to-reel tape of Campbell's entire fourth quarter call surfaced; Jim Trelease, then a college student at the University of Massachusetts, had recorded a 3am re-broadcast of {{the fourth quarter of}} the game. The NBA merged the reel-to-reel with the Dictaphone tape, which also included a short postgame show. German sports journalist Gunter Bork specified that the interruption resulting from Chamberlain's 100th point lasted for nine minutes, after which play continued.|$|E

During that period, he divided his time between his law practice and work in radio. One of Boortz's clients was boxer Evander Holyfield. Holyfield later sued Boortz and other members of his management team {{in the aftermath of a}} failed Subaru dealership investment. Boortz told Atlanta Magazine [...] "It had nothing to do with representing him as a boxer. It was settled and disappeared." [...] Some time later, in a heated on-air exchange between Atlanta mayor <b>Bill</b> <b>Campbell</b> and Boortz, Campbell remarked on the Holyfield relationship: Campbell (sarcastically): By the way, Neal, Evander Holyfield sends his regards ... We talked a little about how good he's doing now and the fact he's getting ready to open up his 57,000 square-foot, $20 million home. How he's fighting for $35 million a fight. I was sorta thinking about when you were representing him. He was living in an apartment over on Lenox Road. He was fighting for about $20,000 a fight. It's sort of interesting how your great legal skills have transferred into financial well-being for Evander .... Boortz responded by calling mayor Campbell an [...] "unethical son of a bitch". Boortz later remarked [...] "It's the only time I've ever been on the air that I lost control." [...] In 1993, Boortz closed his law practice and devoted his full-time to his radio career.|$|E

5000|$|Zingers in {{approximately}} 1/32 scale: In the early 1970s, MPC ventured into caricature model concepts, similar to Revell's Ed Roth Ratfink custom car kits, or <b>Bill</b> <b>Campbell's</b> Weird-Ohs series for Hawk. Such impish creations were popular {{at the time}} and reflected the strong-willed independence of the western and national sub-cultures, which were tied to, first, the beatniks and later, to the hippie scene. MPC's offerings were marketed as 'Zingers', and featured comical stubby and swollen looking vehicles with huge drag racing engines. Examples include Dick Branstner's 'Little Red Truck' (based quite broadly on his 'Color Me Gone' Dodge Truck); the Super Drag Zinger, Super Semi, and Super Dune Zinger; a 1965 Dodge van, a VW microbus, a VW bug, and a Corvette. MPC's caricature models differed from other manufacturer's offerings (such as Aurora) in that they did not feature strange people or animals, but, rather, only oddly distorted vehicles. Thus MPC's answer to the imp phase of hot-rodding was to make the vehicles themselves into caricatures. The Zinger line was reintroduced in 2009 by Round 2 LLC, a recognition of MPC's stature among historic kit-makers.|$|R
