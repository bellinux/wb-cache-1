500|$|A {{piezoelectric}} {{material is}} one which changes shape when an electric field is applied. In reverse, it produces an electric field {{when it is}} distorted. A piezoelectric transducer, in essence, is made simply <b>by</b> <b>plating</b> electrodes on to the piezoelectric material. Early piezoelectric materials used in transducers such as barium titanate had poor temperature stability. [...] This precluded the transducer from functioning {{as one of the}} resonators; {{it had to be a}} separate component. [...] This problem was solved with the introduction of lead zirconate titanate (abbreviated PZT) which is stable enough to be used as a resonator. Another common piezoelectric material is quartz, which has also been used in mechanical filters. [...] However, ceramic materials such as PZT are preferred for their greater electromechanical coupling coefficient.|$|E

500|$|As was {{standard}} for German warships of the period, Seydlitz used Krupp cemented and nickel steel for her armor plating.

50|$|Endothelial {{colony forming}} cells are a late {{outgrowth}} cell type; that is, {{they are only}} isolated after significantly longer culture than CFU-Hill cells.

50|$|Gold has a {{density of}} 19.3 g/cm3, almost {{identical}} to that of tungsten at 19.25 g/cm3; as such, tungsten {{has been used in}} counterfeiting of gold bars, such as <b>by</b> <b>plating</b> a tungsten bar with gold, or taking an existing gold bar, drilling holes, and replacing the removed gold with tungsten rods. By comparison, the density of lead is 11.34 g/cm3, and that of the densest element, osmium, is 22.588 ± 0.015 g/cm3.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the density}} is so {{similar to that}} of gold ({{tungsten}} is only 0.36% less dense), tungsten can also be used in counterfeiting of gold bars, such as <b>by</b> <b>plating</b> a tungsten bar with gold, which has been observed since the 1980s, or taking an existing gold bar, drilling holes, and replacing the removed gold with tungsten rods.

50|$|Thermal {{wheels are}} not {{suitable}} for use where total separation of supply and exhaust air streams is required, since air will bypass at the interface between the air streams at the heat exchanger boundary, and {{at the point where}} the wheel passes from one air stream to the other during its normal rotation.
