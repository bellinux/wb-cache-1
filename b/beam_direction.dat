The in-line configuration also provides a relatively easy extension to apply CCD sensors, creating a separate class of experiments known as digital in-line holography.

30|$|We {{investigate}} the aspect angle {{sensitivity of the}} pump-induced artificial optical emissions in the ionosphere over the European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association (EISCAT) high-frequency transmitter facility at Ramfjord, Norway, {{as a function of}} the pump beam launch angle relative to the magnetic field line direction. The highest intensity optical emissions occur when the pump <b>beam</b> pointing <b>direction</b> is in the magnetic zenith (approximately 12 ° S of local zenith). For pump <b>beam</b> <b>directions</b> further north from field aligned, the optical emission intensity decreases for the same pump power. In addition, the primary photon-emitting region becomes displaced towards the magnetic zenith relative to the pump beam and for larger aspect angles, the brightest emissions were found to be outside the − 3 -dB pump beam width. The Cooperative UK Twin-Located Auroral Sounding System (CUTLASS) coherent scatter high-frequency (HF) radar detected a quasi-constant level of backscatter power from the pumped ionosphere, indicating that saturated striations were formed for all pump <b>beam</b> <b>directions.</b> This indicates that the presence of upper-hybrid resonance is not sufficient to explain the angular sensitivity of the optical emissions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, two {{radiation}} pattern-reconfigurable antennas {{are designed}} to operate near the frequency of 1. 8 GHz. The geometry of the proposed antennas is symmetric {{with respect to the}} vertical center line. The electrical shapes of the antennas are composed of a monopole-loaded loop and an open wire. The open wire functions as either a director or reflector for the two antennas. Depending on the switching state, the antennas can select between two <b>beam</b> <b>directions</b> with no input impedance difference. The sizes of each antenna are then optimized to achieve beam switching capability using PIN diodes and FETs. The reflection coefficients and gain patterns for two bias conditions using both switches are measured and compared with the simulated results.

40|$|The paper compares {{observational}} {{results of}} Jupiter's decametric radiation with the <b>beaming</b> <b>directions</b> predicted by emission of a wide-angle conical sheet of radiation. Using the conical <b>beaming</b> model, <b>beaming</b> <b>directions</b> were calculated assuming a source region above the planetary surface along the Io-affected magnetic flux tube {{at a point}} where the electron gyrofrequency is equal to the radiated frequency. The analysis is based on the octupolar magnetic field models from the Pioneer 11 measurements, and an apparent displacement of the flux tube 20 deg ahead of the Io orbital position produces agreement between the calculated and observed positions of the sources. The longitudinal extents of the three main sources are approximated by limiting radiation to points where the angle between the magnetic field vector at the point of emission and the Zenographic equatorial plane is at a minimum. For lower frequencies the Io-dependent radiation is emitted at all longitudes, and the beaming model concurs with this conclusion when all cutoffs are eliminated...|$|R
