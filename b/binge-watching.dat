500|$|Critics previewed {{the first}} four episodes of the season under {{non-disclosure}} agreements that they not reveal any spoilers. Reviews began appearing as early as January 31. Many critics who previewed the season noted the first episode was shocking, but withheld the surprises of the four episodes made available for preview. Willa Paskin of Slate broke the embargo nearly a day early revealing several spoilers. Whereas [...] critics had been somewhat split on the propriety of <b>binge-watching</b> the first season, they were more supportive of the practice for season two.|$|E
500|$|Lena Hall, a Broadway {{actress and}} singer, stated {{she watches the}} show as it makes her feel [...] "super happy" [...] and appreciates the lessons the show teaches, and {{considers}} herself a [...] "Pegasister". In winning the 2014 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical, Hall ended her acceptance speech mentioning the television show's subtitle, [...] "Friendship Is Magic". Over four months after her shout-out at the Tonys, Hall announced on her Twitter {{that she would be}} a guest star in the show's fifth season, and soon appeared in the episode [...] "The Mane Attraction" [...] as Coloratura/Rara. Upon the episode's premiere, Hall live streamed her reaction to the episode with her niece on Periscope and letting viewers ask questions during the commercial breaks, she went into detail about her experiences behind the scenes of the production of the episode and her history with the show itself, admitting to <b>binge-watching</b> the first three seasons of the show when she first started to watch it.|$|E

500|$|Earlier {{versions}} of the story featured a sensate from Iraq and more about Whispers, the villain of the show. The show was transformed when the writers decided to limit the storytelling, {{with the exception of}} the opening scene of the first episode, to the perspective of the eight characters. This means that every scene set in San Francisco must be about Nomi, in Chicago about Will and so on. Since the show begins with the characters not knowing what is happening to them and without being able to cut e.g. to the villains like a traditional show, the audience starts with the same questions and confusion as the characters do. As the characters slowly begin to understand more about what's happening to them over the course of several episodes, the audience does as well, at the same pace. Straczynski notes this type of writing wouldn't work if they were writing for a traditional network. [...] "The first episode is written in a way that you could never do a pilot. With pilots you have to set up all the rules and explain everything to hook people in," [...] said Stranczynski. Instead, taking advantage of the <b>binge-watching</b> model Netflix promotes, the series was written as a continuous 12-hour movie, making it possible to tell the story at a different pace.|$|E
500|$|The {{second season}} was made {{available}} {{in its entirety}} on February 14, 2014 (Valentine's Day) at 12:01a.m. PT. Prior {{to the release of}} season 1, three reviewers, Hank Stuever of The Washington Post, Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal, and Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times, commented on possible binge viewing by Netflix customers. Stanley notes that the show [...] "is probably seen best one episode at a time. It's a delicious immorality play with an excellent cast, but the tempo is slow and oddly ponderous—a romp slowed down to a dirge". Smith also notes that due to its [...] "relentless theme", [...] "House of Cards might go down better in smaller portions and thus be enjoyably prolonged", deriding potential binge watchers as people who liken a delicacy to a [...] "bag of M's". However, Stuever disagreed about season 1 saying [...] "So, on the iffy chance that House of Cards draws you in and you simply cannot stop watching, then, yes, you may power-binge your way through all 13 hours at once". Upon viewing the four episode season 2 preview Time James Poniewozik says [...] "I could easily see powering through the season in a free weekend, precisely because no individual episode needs much time to sink in". Stanley also felt the second season was [...] "binge-worthy" [...] upon viewing the preview. However, Ellen Gray of Philly.com supports not <b>binge-watching</b> the season, as she believes it does not serve it well.|$|E

50|$|After {{a dispute}} over the film's tone, Carnahan quit in July 2004. Tom Cruise then called J.J. Abrams, {{offering}} the directorial role for the film after having <b>binge-watched</b> the first two seasons of Alias. Abrams ultimately signed on, with production delayed a year due to his contractual obligations with Alias and Lost. During this time, Branagh, Moss, and Johansson departed from the project because of the many delays in production. On June 8, 2005, Paramount Pictures gave the film the green-light after a new cast of actors was hired and the film's budget was redeveloped, with Cruise taking a major pay cut.|$|R
5000|$|For season 2, which premiered on September 23, 2015, {{the show}} changed to allow each episodes winner {{to return for}} the next episode as the {{returning}} champion; however, if a game ended with all three players finishing with 0 points, it would result in three new players competing the next episode. This is the same format followed by Jeopardy!, {{in which they could}} compete indefinitely unless beaten; a tie between two or three players with at least 1 point would result in a sudden-death answer playoff, in a pre-determined category. This was to allow the show to be seen as more easily <b>binge-watched.</b>|$|R
500|$|BuzzFeed {{ranked the}} episode 3rd on its {{complete}} ranking of Veronica Mars episodes, {{comparing it to}} Buffy the Vampire Slayer"both these shows have always managed a perfect balance between high school drama (gossip, futile betrayals, and short-lived romances) and extremely powerful and dark themes (sexism, rape, harassment, addiction, and domestic violence)." [...] TV Line ranked the episode 2nd on a similar list, only below [...] "Pilot". Wired called the episode a necessary episode if one <b>binge-watched</b> the show, writing that [...] "The information she uncovers is staggeringly heartbreaking, {{and the way in}} which the show handled the arc pays off with complex, difficult confrontations." ...|$|R
2500|$|As Netflix {{does not}} reveal {{subscriber}} viewership numbers {{for any of}} their original series, Parrot Analytics determined the season was generating the second-highest demand among the Marvel Netflix series during their respective launch weeks. Parrot calculated that Iron Fist was generating over 63 million [...] "Demand Expressions" [...] at its peak, behind Luke Cages 69 million, with Parrot calculating expressions [...] "by evaluating streaming video, P2P-sharing, social chatter, and more." [...] 7Park Data, which measures the number of streams on subscription video services, determined Iron Fist {{to be the most}} binge-watched premiere for Netflix in 2017. It found that 54.7% of Iron Fist streams on March 17, 2017 were of three episodes or more, against the average hour-long show binge score of 46.9%. 7Park Data also determined that Iron Fist accounted for 14.6% of all Netflix streams on its premiere date, the highest percentage of any series premiere measured by the company, beating the second season of Daredevil (13.8%) and Luke Cage (12.8%) on their premiere dates. Parrot later revealed that demand for Iron Fist a week after it launched was cut in half. This was the largest drop in retention between the four Marvel Netflix series, potentially indicating [...] "that people started <b>binge-watching</b> the show in its first few days and then didn't come back to finish the season the next weekend." [...] The marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the third-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering slightly 28% of the viewers that the second season of Daredevil received, which was the most viewed season according to Jumpstart. Jumpshot, which [...] "analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company’s U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.|$|E

[...] Researchers have argued that <b>binge-watching</b> should be defined based on the context and the actual content of TV show.|$|E
25|$|In India, where Netflix was {{unavailable}} prior to January 2016, House of Cards premiered on February 20, 2014, on Zee Café. Seasons 1 and 2 were aired back–to–back. The channel aired all 13 episodes of season 3 on March 28 and 29, 2015. This {{marked the first}} time that an English-language general entertainment channel in India aired all episodes of the latest season of a series together. The move was intended to satisfy viewers' urge to <b>binge-watch</b> the season. Although Netflix launched in India in January 2016, House of Cards was not available on the service until March 4. All episodes of season 4 had their television premiere on Zee Café on March 12 and 13, 2016.|$|R
5000|$|A {{marathon}} is {{an event}} in which viewers or readers engage many hours-worth of media (film, television, books, YouTube videos etc.) in a condensed time period. This phrase represents a two-fold shift from <b>binge-watch</b> in that it incorporates other media (not just television) and it reduces the negative connotations associated with bingeing. In the 2014 book Media Marathoning: Immersions in Morality, Lisa Perks describes media marathoning as a “comprehensive and complimentary phrase” that “connotes a conjoined triumph of commitment and stamina. This phrase also captures viewers’ or readers’ engrossment, effort, and sense of accomplishment surrounding their media interaction.” [...] Netflix Executive Todd Yellin {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "I don't like the term 'binge,' because it sounds almost pathological. 'Marathon' sounds more celebratory." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{a report}} {{released}} by Netflix {{it was discovered that}} at least 70% of the viewers that watched up to the third episode ended up watching the entire first season, and Straczynski was told there are people that watch it [...] "straight through – three, four, six times." [...] In another report released by Netflix, Sense8 was listed among the shows whose viewers tend to heavily <b>binge-watch</b> their first seasons, rather than savoring their episodes by watching them at a slower pace. Netflix's Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos praised the success of Sense8 in the up-and-coming French and German markets but also globally. Vice president of international series for Netflix Erik Barmack has named Sense8 {{one of the most popular}} Netflix series in the Brazilian market. Less than three days after the premiere of the first season, Variety reported that it had been pirated more than half a million times, regardless of the series' digital distribution.|$|R
50|$|Research {{conducted}} by media scholar Emil Steiner at Temple University isolated six motivations for <b>binge-watching.</b> The author concludes that while compulsiveness is possible, most binge-viewers have an ambivalent {{relationship with the}} nascent techno-cultural behavior.

5000|$|Research {{conducted}} at the University of Texas at Austin found binge watching television is correlated to depression, loneliness, self-regulation deficiency, and obesity.

25|$|The Netflix {{model has}} also {{affected}} viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60% of Americans said they <b>binge-watch</b> shows and nearly {{eight out of}} 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule. Netflix has successfully continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes {{at a time of}} their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace. Netflix has capitalized on these habits by automatically playing the next episode in the series, removing the 15-second wait times of content on other streaming services. The structure that allows convenient viewing of episodes, as well as the intent to provide content of quality comparable to some broadcast and cable television programs, in effect often results in the viewer being hooked into the program by the time the next episode starts.|$|R
5000|$|ITV Director of Television Peter Fincham {{warned that}} <b>binge-watching</b> erodes the [...] "social value" [...] of {{television}} {{as there are}} fewer opportunities to anticipate future episodes and discuss them with friends.|$|E
5000|$|Researchers have operationally defined media marathoning and <b>binge-watching</b> in {{different}} ways. Perks provides medium-specific definitions. Marathoners must have [...] "viewed a television season {{in a week}} or less, watched three or more films from the same series {{in a week or}} less, or read three or more books from the same series in a month or less." [...] A Netflix-commissioned study defined [...] "binge-watching" [...] as viewing 2-6 episodes of the same show in one sitting. A 2014 TiVo survey defined <b>binge-watching</b> as watching 3 or more episodes of the same show in one day.In extreme media marathons, such as the Simpsons Marathon (which lasted 86 hours and 37 minutes), the viewing time can last an exceptionally long time.|$|E
