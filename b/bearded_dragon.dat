40|$|Egg {{incubation}} temperature impacts {{a range of}} phenotypes in oviparous reptiles including sex, growth, physiology, behaviour and cognition. However, the long-term behavioural consequences of egg {{incubation temperature}} have seldom been studied. This project investigated {{the long-term effects of}} egg incubation temperature on the behaviour and cognition of <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons.</b> The first experiment tested the impact of incubation temperature on the growth and foraging behaviour of <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons.</b> The second experiment tested the personality of lizards and the third the gaze following ability of lizards. The results showed that egg incubation temperature influenced the growth and foraging behaviour of <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons.</b> While the personality of the lizards was unaffected, incubation temperature did influence the development of different behavioural traits during ontogeny. The gaze following ability of <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons</b> was unaffected by incubation temperature however the results did show {{for the first time that}} a lizard species is capable of gaze following into the distance. The overall results show that incubation temperature impacted upon some of the long-term behaviour of <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons</b> and suggests that egg incubation temperature will influence the lifetime history trajectory of <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons...</b>|$|R

25|$|There {{are more}} than 700 species of lizards in Australia with representatives of five families. There are over 130 species in 20 genera of gecko found {{throughout}} the Australian continent. The Pygopodidae is a family of limbless lizards endemic to the Australian region; all 39 species from seven genera occur in Australia. The Agamidae or dragon lizards are represented by 70 species in 14 genera, including the thorny devil, <b>bearded</b> <b>dragon</b> and frill-necked lizard. There are 30 species of monitor lizard, family Varanidae, in Australia, where they {{are commonly known as}} goannas. The largest Australian monitor is the perentie, which can reach up to 2m in length.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{exposure}} to different UVb compact lamps on the vitamin D status of growing <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons</b> (Pogona vitticeps) was studied. Forty-two newly hatched <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons</b> (< 24 h old) were allocated to six treatment groups (n = 7 per group). Five groups were exposed to different UVb compact lamps for two hours per day, with a control group not exposed to UVb radiation. At 120 days of age, blood samples were obtained and concentrations of 25 (OH) D 3, Ca, P and uric acid were determined. In addition, plasma 25 (OH) D 3 concentration was determined in free-living adult <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons</b> to provide a reference level. Only one treatment resulted in elevated levels of 25 (OH) D 3 compared to the control group (41. 0 ± 12. 85 vs. 2. 0 ± 0. 0 nmol/L). All UVb-exposed groups had low 25 (OH) D 3 plasma levels compared to earlier studies on captive <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons</b> {{as well as in}} comparison with the free-living adult <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons</b> (409 ± 56 nmol/L). Spectral analysis indicated that all treatment lamps emitted UVb wavelengths effective for some cutaneous vitamin D synthesis. None of these lamps, under this regime, appeared to have provided a sufficient UVb dose to enable synthesis of plasma 25 (OH) D 3 levels similar to those of free-living <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons</b> in their native habitat. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This article {{describes}} a newly recognized highly malignant neoplastic entity in young <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons</b> (Pogona vitticeps), gastric neuroendocrine carcinomas, which readily metastasize. Ten <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons</b> with histories of anorexia (8), vomiting (3), hyperglycemia (2), and anemia (3) {{were included in}} this study. All animals had neoplastic masses in their stomach, with metastasis to the liver. Microscopically, 6 of these neuroendocrine carcinomas were well-differentiated and 4 were poorly differentiated. For further characterization, immunohistochemistry for protein gene product 9. 5, neuron-specific enolase, endorphin, chromogranins A and B, synaptophysin, somatostatin, insulin, glucagon, gastrin, pancreatic polypeptide, and vasoactive intestinal peptide was performed on 5 animals. Because only immunolabeling for somatostatin was consistently observed in all neoplasms, a diagnosis of somatostatinoma was made for these 5 <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons.</b> Some neoplasms also exhibited multihormonal expression. Electron microscopy performed on 1 tumor confirmed the presence of neuroendocrine granules within neoplastic cells. Gastric neuroendocrine carcinomas, and specifically somatostatinomas, have not been previously reported in <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons,</b> or other reptiles, and may be underdiagnosed due to inconsistent, ambiguous clinical signs. In humans, pancreatic somatostatinomas {{are associated with a}} syndrome of hypersomatostatinemia, which includes hyperglycemia, weight loss...|$|R

40|$|Regulating body {{temperature}} {{is a critical}} function for vertebrates and many invertebrates. Vertebrates that rely on ambient temperature as a heat source (ectotherms) make use of multiple voluntary and involuntary behaviours to thermoregulate, including body orientation. The purpose of this work was to examine orientation behaviour in <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons</b> (Pogona vitticeps) as well as possible coordination between thermoregulatory responses. Both adult and two week old neonatal <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons</b> were placed in a thermal gradient and left to thermoregulate behaviourally in order to observe {{the presence of a}} thermoregulatory orientation preference. Since a thermal orientation bias could manifest from a preference for favoring rostral versus caudal traits, animals were subsequently subjected to a separate experiment, in which either heat exchange across the tail or respiratory heat exchange from gaping was inhibited. Changes in thermoregulatory behaviour were then observed in the manipulated <b>bearded</b> <b>dragons</b> in order to assess the potential contributors to thermal preferences as well as isolate potential coordination between behaviours. Both adult and two week old neonatal dragons displayed a non-random orientation preference for facing a heat source that strengthened with time exposed to a thermal gradient, supporting this behaviour as a thermoregulatory response. <b>Bearded</b> <b>dragons</b> also exhibited changes in orientation preference and gaping behaviour when the tail was insulated and when gaping was inhibited, but no changes to selected ambient temperature, indicating that the changes to gaping and orientation behaviours are compensatory responses that support the presence of coordination between thermoregulatory behaviours...|$|R
