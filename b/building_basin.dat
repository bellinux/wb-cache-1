5000|$|Jean Bart {{was laid}} down in December 1936; she {{was built in the}} large Caquot dock in Penhoët, {{commonly}} known as the [...] "Jean Bart dock". She was floated out on 6 March 1940, and transferred from the <b>building</b> <b>basin</b> to the nearby fitting-out basin. She was expected to leave in October 1940. In May 1940, it was decided that the uncompleted battleship had to be sent to a safer place in Britain or in French Africa, beyond the Luftwaffe's range. However, the fitting-out basin, where the ship was afloat, was separated from the navigational channel by an earth dam. In late May, when it appeared that Germany would win the Battle of France, the Navy began dredging the earth dam, so Jean Bart could leave at high tide on 20 June. Half the propulsion machinery (boilers and turbines) was installed, to be used when necessary. On 18 June, as German troops were approaching, her captain was ordered to prepare to sail immediately or to scuttle the ship. The dredging work was finished the middle of the next night, with very narrow margins for the battleship to pass through, and {{in the early hours of}} 19 June, nearly in view of the German vanguard, Jean Bart - barely 75% completed, her steam engines never having been worked before, and under the threat of German bombers - was taken out of the Saint Nazaire docks by four tugs. She reached Casablanca under her own steam on 22 June; the average speed on the journey's final leg was 22 kn.|$|E
40|$|A logical {{sequence}} {{for evaluating the}} mechanical properties of N-Reactor pressure tubing in the as-received condition is similar to evaluation after reactor service. The usual difficulties associated with testing a heavy tube to failure with 300 C water are compounded after reactor service by the high gamma radioactivity of the discharged tubes. Success in testing of discharged reactor pressure tubing in a pilot underwater facility led {{to the construction of}} an Irradiated Tube Testing ·Facility (ITTF) adjacent to the Radiometallurgy Building. The ITTF consists of a 10. ft 6 in. deep, water-filled basin 15 ft long by 10 ft wide, with six test chambers placed within the basin. These chambers are stainless steel bell jars that enclose the specimen, blast shielding, and electric furnace. The vessels exclude water from the hot specimen and furnace during testing and contain the pressure surge that occurs when the hot pressurized water flashes to steam upon failure of the test specimen. The ITTF basin is connected to the Radiometallurgy <b>Building</b> <b>Basin</b> by an underwater tube containing a conveyor system. The conveyor makes it possible to transfer highly radioactive materiais with ease and safety. Remote handling tools were developed to measure the tubes, attach end closures, attach thermocouples, and load lhe specimen within the furnace containment vessels...|$|E

40|$|Held in Chicago to {{celebrate}} the 400 th anniversary {{of the discovery of}} America, the Chicago World’s Fair of 1893 {{has been one of the}} first events of a kind later defined as ‘media events’ (Susman, 1983). Set up in a liminal period for American life, this ‘event’ was a ‘rite of passage’ paving the road to modernity out of traditional life, as Henry Adams recognized when he defined the Fair as “the first expression of American thought as a unity. ” I suggest the Columbian Exposition is a worthwhile case study for this special issue from a historical point of view. The Fair was indeed one of the first cases in which the interplay among urban planning, communication technologies and marketing strategies — a mark of the contemporary production of urban space (McQuire, 2008) — can be observed. I would also suggest it is important from a genealogical point of view because it contributes to unveil the conditions of emergence of such interplay as the outcome of a process of interactions among several social actors which had the task of marketing an imaginary of the city adequate to the new economic and social conditions of America (Harris, 1990). I will therefore attempt to show how the Chicago World’s Fair was both a place where to trace back the genesis of modern American urban life and an opérateur of such emergence, given the fact that the experience of its ideal city life contributed in shaping the imaginary at its foundation. Through a description of the Fair I show how the representation (a literal ‘staging’) of a temporary ideal city — a land of enchantment freed from pain and poverty, with beautiful marble–like <b>buildings,</b> <b>basins,</b> theatres, palaces of consumption, spectacles, entertainments and wonders — was strategically conceived to produce actual effects on the imaginary of the public. As Lewis Mumford (1934) and Louis Sullivan (1949) recognized, the ‘liminal’ characters of the fair became ‘permanent’ features of modern cities and their everyday life through the staging of illusory (but with real consequences) effects...|$|R
