50|$|The bilge area is {{the lowest}} area on a ship. The bilge water that {{collects}} here include drain water or leftover water from the boilers, water collecting tanks, drinking water and other places where water can not overflow. However, bilge water doesn't just include water drainage. Another system that drains into the <b>Bilge</b> <b>system</b> comes from the propulsion area of the ship. Here fuels, lubricants, hydraulic fluid, antifreeze, solvents, and cleaning chemicals drain into the engine room bilges in small quantities. The OWS is intended to remove {{a large proportion of}} these contaminants before discharge to the environment (overboard to the sea).|$|E

50|$|This also {{predicated}} a need {{to change}} the electrical systems and the installation of a third generator. The requirements of the Canadian Shipping Act meant that the electrical supply would be changed to 120 Volts/60 Hertz and that the water cooling system had to be redesigned. The addition of a hardened point for the possible installation of heavier armament required strengthening the foredeck and improving the fire protection. The installation of a new firemain supply to the new ammunition storage lockers required the redesign of several systems, among them the auxiliary seawater and <b>bilge</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ships {{that do not}} {{leak oil}} into the ship's bilge water have {{installed}} Fast Oil Recovery Systems (FORS) Their goal is to eliminate all of the oil-contaminated <b>bilge</b> water. Their <b>systems</b> remove 99.9 percent of {{the oil in a}} vessel's bilge, and save thousands of dollars. They use these systems instead of absorbent pads and filters because pads and filters are messy, expensive, and require high maintenance.|$|R
50|$|The kayak Lot 41 was {{designed}} for the trans-Tasman crossing by Rob Feloy, who had designed the kayak for Peter Bray's trans-Atlantic Crossing approximately six years earlier. The Lot 41 design includes two cockpits, a cabin at {{the stern of the}} craft, a large water tank and storage for over 60 days of food for the two kayakers. An array of solar panels was incorporated into the design in order to charge the batteries used to power communication <b>systems,</b> <b>bilge</b> pumps and a water desalination unit. The fibreglass kayak was built in Australia in 2005, and was fitted with support systems including emergency beacons, satellite phone, global tracking system, and GPS.|$|R
5000|$|The DUKW {{was built}} around the GMC AFKWX, a cab-over-engine (COE) version of the GMC CCKW six-wheel-drive {{military}} truck, {{with the addition of}} a watertight hull and a propeller. It was powered by a 269.5 cuin L GMC Model 270 straight-six engine. A five-speed overdrive transmission drove a transfer case for the propeller, then a two-speed transfer case to drive the axles. The propeller and front axle were selectable from their transfer case. A power take-off on the transmission drove the air-compressor and winch. It weighed 13,000 lb empty and operated at 50 mph on road and 5.5 kn on water. It was 31 ft long, 8 ft wide, 7 ft high with the folding-canvas top down and 8 ft high with the top up. It was not an armored vehicle, being plated with sheet steel between 1/16 and 1/8 inches (1.6-3.2 mm) thick to minimize weight. A high-capacity <b>bilge</b> pump <b>system</b> kept it afloat if the thin hull was breached by holes up to 2 in in diameter. One in four DUKWs mounted a [...]50-caliber Browning heavy machine gun on a ring mount.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{our project}} is to design, {{construct}} and test an ROV that responds dependably to user commands. This task involves designing the physical structure of the ROV, its propulsion system, and its navigation system. We used the Seafox, a simple ROV whose designers published instructions for its construction [1], {{as a basis for}} our vehicle's structure. Our project involves slight modifications to the Seafox's physical configuration and great expansion upon its control unit. We have created control circuitry that operates the ROV's <b>bilge</b> pump propulsion <b>system</b> and is compatible with a joystick command interface for real-time control. Our design allows the ROV to maneuver along 5 axes (forward, backward, right, left, pitch, and yaw - Figure 2). An on-board camera provides visual feedback from the ROV to aid in navigation and exploration, and sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes are included for use in localization. The ROV serves as a platform upon which other sensors and/or mechanical components can be mounted for further work in underwater environments...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{in marine}} systems design {{is about how}} to assess the future {{uncertainty}} in a design setting, or as the topic puts it; semi-submersible platform design to meet uncertainty in the future operation scenarios. Central terms that will be discussed are robustness, flexibility, adaptability, and real options, so-called ilities. Also, methods for evaluation of designs in relation to ilities and future uncertainty are presented. The background for this thesis is the ever importance of a good assessment of investment projects in the offshore business in general, and more specific in relation to designs subjected to different forms of ilities. Now, more than ever, {{it is crucial to}} make the right decisions when designing an offshore construction, to ensure that an investment is viable. This thesis has used the concept of an intervention semi, provided by Aker Solutions, to assess problems related to these aspects. At first, design drivers for the concept were identified. These were found to be cost, weigh and operability, where (total) cost and (total) weight are strictly correlated. Operability, meaning the ability to keep operations running in different conditions and situations, are mainly dependent on motion characteristics and layout, where vertical motions were found to be the most important. The properties of the intervention semi was presented as a functional breakdown, divided in five main categories; well intervention, drilling, power generation, station keeping and transit, and other functions. The last category, the one called other functions, incorporated accommodation, ballast and <b>bilge</b> water <b>systems,</b> and heave compensation system. Most relevant for the intervention concept are the intervention functions and drilling functions. Of well intervention procedures, the concept {{should be able to do}} wireline operations, coiled tubing operations, and for drilling, through tubing rotary drilling will be the main procedure. After presenting the properties for the intervention semi concept, aspects of changing requirements due to uncertainty in the future, were discussed. The design functions of changing requirements identified were operation method and technology, environment and legislation, area of operation, and economics. Following this, a discussion of how to accommodate for these changing requirements were presented, with focus on aspects regarding flexibility, robustness, adaptability, and real options. After these terms and aspects had been discussed, an evaluation of the concept in relation to the ilities presented was done. Most relevant was the possibility of a development of the coiled tubing equipment, the aspect of managed pressure drilling as a function that might be needed in the future, and the use of rental equipment. Also, ilities were identified and discussed in a concept similar to the intervention semi presented in this thesis. From this, it was found that functions related to the environment (regarding emissions) would be a potential area of ilities, due to the continually increasing focus on such matters, and by having functions related to this designed with ilities, It would make it easier to improve these functions at a later time. Also, the aspect of extra deck space was discussed, which will give the design better flexibility, and in general, it was found that flexibility in the procedures for intervention and drilling operation was important for this concept. Some functions and aspects were also found not to be relevant for any sort of ilities. Among these were functions related to heavy drilling, increased water depth and the aspect of ice class. To find the value of a design with functional ilities, different methods and aspects were presented. At first, economical aspects were discussed, and methods using net present value were found to be relevant in relation to the valuation of ilities. Another approach discussed was scenario development and assessment, where in particular one method was found relevant. This method proposes to find an optimal design for the scenario assumed most probable, and then test this design against the other possible scenarios (using the models as simulation models) to get an impression of the resilience of the designs. Two decision support models were proposed, Model 1 and Model 2. The first model presented, Model 1, can be described as a &# 147;hybrid&# 148; decision model, part static, part dynamic, where an optimal design is found for a set of contracts, taking real options into consideration. The contracts should reflect the future, and from a set of base designs, with varying possibilities for functions and options, a design with an optimal combination of capabilities and options will be the result of solving the problem. Model 2 is sort of a static variant of Model 1, where the possibility of real options is no longer available. The model will still find a design with an optimal combination of capabilities for a set of contracts, but all capabilities must be part of the construction initially. Further, the two models are implemented for use in a commercial solver, and parameters and constraints are discussed. These implemented models were then used for the illustrative cases. The case studies illustrate how the two models presented can be utilised, and in addition illustrate how the scenario assessment discussed earlier can be combined with the decision support models. There are mainly three cases presented; two where Model 1 is used, and a third, where Model 2 is used. In Case 1 there are three base designs, with different characteristics, and one only attribute (supplementary function) that should be assessed. Three scenarios are presented as a basis for the contract generation. First, an optimal design solution was found for each scenario (Case 1 a, Case 1 b and Case 1 c). Secondly, a scenario assessment was done, where the solution from the scenario assumed most probable is tested against the other two scenarios using the model as a simulation model rather than an optimisation model. Scenario 1 was assumed to be the most probable one, represented by Case 1 a, and the optimal solution for this case was Design 1. This design was then tested against the two other scenarios, and it came out with a rather good result, illustrating the resilience of the chosen design. Case 2 illustrated a more complex problem, where an optimal solution should be found among 16 different base designs and four possible attributes. The attributes could either be part of the design initially or made as options that can be realised at a later time. The instance tested is assumed to be somewhat more complex than a commercial problem, but illustrates in a good way the capability of Model 1. Case 3 is an example of how Model 2 can be used. In Case 3 a, only one base design is available, and with a set of four possible attributes, an optimal design should be found. Due to the &# 147;static&# 148; character of Model 2, the attributes can only be part of the initial design. Case 3 b is much the same, except here there are two base designs to choose among, in addition to the four attributesA computational study was carried out, using Model 1, and only this, as it is assumed to be the most complex of the two models. The test incident assumed most relevant, with 100 contracts, four base designs, and eight attributes, can be solved one time in on the average less than two seconds, and for a full scenario analysis, consisting of about 1000 runs, the analysis will take about half an hour. As a concluding remark for this thesis, I will say that the main scope, which I in my opinion was to discuss how different design solutions can be evaluated in relation to future uncertainty, was answered in a good way with the two decision models proposed together with how these could be used in a scenario setting. </p...|$|R
