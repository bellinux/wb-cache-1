In this paper, we propose a new <b>blending</b> method to effectively control {{the shape of}} <b>blending</b> surfaces, which can also satisfy the <b>blending</b> constraints of tangent continuity exactly. This new <b>blending</b> method {{is based on the}} concept of swept surfaces controlled by a vector-valued fourth order ordinary differential equation (ODE).

The shape of <b>blending</b> surfaces is controlled by manipulating the generator with the solution to a vector-valued fourth order ODE. This new <b>blending</b> methods have the following advantages: (1) exact satisfaction of C 1 C 1 continuous <b>blending</b> boundary constraints, (2) effective shape control of <b>blending</b> surfaces, (3) high computing efficiency due to explicit mathematical representation of <b>blending</b> surfaces, and (4) ability to <b>blend</b> multiple (more than two) primary surfaces...|$|R
