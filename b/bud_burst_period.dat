40|$|Viticultural {{practices}} such as trunk girdling and shoot topping along with defoliation, shading and node number per vine treatments were used to alter the carbohydrate physiology of mature Chardonnay grapevines growing in the cool climate of Canterbury, New Zealand. The timing of vine defoliation in the season previous to fruiting decreased concentrations of over-wintering carbohydrate reserves (mostly starch) in both the trunks and roots of grapevines. Roots were particularly sensitive, with defoliation as early as 4 weeks after bloom in the previous season reducing starch concentrations to 1. 5 %Dwt at bud burst compared with 17 %Dwt in non-defoliated vines. In contrast, partial vine defoliation as early as bloom in the previous season reduced root starch concentrations to 4 - 7 %Dwt at bud burst compared with 15 %Dwt in non-defoliated vines. Vine shading and trunk girdling treatments at bloom in the previous season, resulted in small reductions in root starch concentrations (16 %Dwt) compared with non-shaded and non-girdled vines (19 %Dwt), but shoot topping did not. Study across three growing seasons established that higher concentrations of over-wintering trunk and root carbohydrate reserves were associated with warmer and sunnier weather in the previous growing season. Individual shoot leaf removal at either the beginning or {{towards the end of}} the inflorescence initiation period, reduced shoot starch concentrations to 3 - 6 %Dwt compared with 11 %Dwt for no leaf removal, such reductions persisted through to the following season. Shoot topping at the start of the initiation period had no effect on shoot carbohydrate accumulation, but trunk girdling temporarily increased shoot starch concentrations during the first 31 days after treatment. Reductions in over-wintering trunk and root carbohydrate reserves were associated with a reduction in inflorescences per shoot and flowers per inflorescence in the following season, the reduction as much as 50 % compared with non carbohydrate stressed vines. While there were strong linear or curvilinear relationships between the concentration of starch in trunks and roots at bud burst and inflorescences per shoot and flowers per inflorescence, in case the of inflorescences per shoot, there was not an immediate cause and effect because inflorescences were initiated in the previous season. Individual shoot leaf removal during the inflorescence initiation period illustrated that leaf removal directly inhibited the initiation of inflorescences in latent buds. Shoot carbohydrate measurements showed a strong curvilinear relationship to the number of inflorescences per shoot, with a threshold starch concentration of 10 - 12 %Dwt during the inflorescence initiation period required for a maximum number of inflorescences per shoot. Furthermore, examination of individual node positions emphasised the importance of the subtending leaf on the initiation of inflorescences within the latent bud. The number of inflorescences per shoot post bud burst was reduced on vines that were both carbohydrate reserve stressed (by previous season's defoliation) and had a high node (108) number retained per vine after winter pruning compared with little or no reduction in inflorescences per shoot on carbohydrate reserve stressed vines that had a low (20) node number per vine. The reduction in inflorescences per shoot on high node vines was associated with reduced carbohydrate reserves and reduced shoot vigour (thinner and lighter shoots). Flowers per inflorescence were reduced by as much 50 % in response to lower overwintering carbohydrate reserves. Fewer flowers per inflorescence were attributed to a reduction in primary branching of the inflorescence and also a reduction in flowers per branch. Strong linear relationships between the concentrations of starch in trunks and roots and flowers per inflorescence indicate that the determination of flowers per inflorescence, unlike inflorescences per shoot, may be dependent on the level of overwintering carbohydrate reserves. This is most likely due to changes in branching of the inflorescence and individual flower formation occurring during the <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> <b>period.</b> Per cent fruitset was not affected by reductions in carbohydrate reserves, so fewer inflorescences per shoot and flowers per inflorescence resulted in reduced vine yield. The findings of this thesis indicate that changes in the level of carbohydrate production and partitioning in response to a range of viticultural management practices and seasonal weather contribute to seasonal variation in grapevine flowering and yields in New Zealand's cool climate environment. The relationships between carbohydrate reserves and flowering illustrate the potential to use this information to predict grapevine flowering and forecast yields. The practical implications of this research illustrate that the viticulturist must manage grapevines not only for the current crop, but also for subsequent crops by maintaining sufficient carbohydrate reserves for balanced growth flowering and fruiting from season to season...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Plants {{regulate}} cellular oxygen partial pressures (pO 2), {{together with}} reduction/ oxidation (redox) state to manage rapid developmental transitions such as <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> after a <b>period</b> of quiescence. However, {{our understanding of}} pO 2 regulation in complex meristematic organs such as buds is incomplete, and particularly lacks spatial resolution. Methods: The gradients in pO 2 from the outer scales to the primary meristem complex were measured in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) buds, together with respiratory CO 2 production rates and the accumulation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, from ecodormancy through the first 72 h preceding <b>bud</b> <b>burst,</b> triggered by the transition from low to ambient temperatures. Key Results: Steep internal pO 2 gradients were measured in dormant buds with values as low as 2. 5 kPa found {{in the core of}} the bud prior to <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> Respiratory CO 2 production rates increased soon after the transition from low to ambient temperatures and the bud tissues gradually became oxygenated in a patterned process. Within 3 h of the transition to ambient temperatures, superoxide accumulation was observed in the cambial meristem, co-localising with lignified cellulose associated with pro-vascular tissues. Thereafter, superoxide accumulated in other areas subtending the apical meristem complex, in the absence of significant hydrogen peroxide accumulation, except in the cambial meristem. By 72 h, the internal pO 2 gradient showed a biphasic profile, where the minimum pO 2 was external to the core of the bud complex. Conclusions: Spatial and temporal control of the tissue oxygen environment occurs within quiescent buds, and the transition from quiescence to <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> is accompanied by a regulated relaxation of the hypoxic state and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the developing cambium and vascular tissues of the heterotrophic grapevine buds...|$|R

Although the large interannual variations in dates of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> and growth termination have been widely discussed, little is known about the genotypic and spatial variations in phenology and how these sources of variation are related to temporal variation. We measured <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> of eight white birch (Betula pendula Roth) clones in two field experiments daily over 6 years, and deter-mined the termination of growth for the same clones over 2 years.

Al-though interannual variations in date of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> {{have been widely}} discussed, {{little is known about}} within-population vari-ation, the key determinants for this variation and the effects of this variation on estimates of trends in <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> date. Over a period of nine years, we monitored timing of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> daily in 30 mature white birch (Betula pendula Roth) trees in a natu-rally regenerated stand. Our results revealed not only large interannual variation but also considerable intraannual varia-tion among individual trees in date of <b>bud</b> <b>burst,</b> the maximum within-population variation being four weeks. <b>Bud</b> <b>burst</b> can be accurately predicted by the date when a threshold value of tem-perature sum in spring is reached (base temperature + 5 °C).

In grapevine, it has been shown that if canes are trained upward, terminal buds grow shoots first. <b>Bud</b> <b>burst</b> timing is not easily predictable because its relationship with temperature is very complex and because there is strong competition among buds along the cane. Along a single cane, a <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> hierarchy can be created using artificial tools. An experiment was carried out with the aim of assessing the effect of bud heating on <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> timing and to evaluate if a <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> hierarchy could be established in Merlot grapevines. Both curved canes (Sylvoz) and untied canes (Casarsa) were used. In the middle of the cane, where blind buds often occur, two buds were isolated inside a PET (Polyethylen Therphthalate) bottle together with a resistor which enhanced the temperature inside the enclosure. The internal temperature was monitored by using a thermocouple connected with a data-logger; two power levels for bud heating (0. 4 W or 0. 2 W) were compared and in both cases an anticipation of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> was observed when compared to the un-heated control.

40|$|Summary We {{examined}} {{effects of}} elevated CO 2 and tem-perature on cold hardiness and <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seedlings. Two-year-old seedlings were grown for 2. 5 years in semi-closed, sunlit chambers at either ambient or elevated (ambient + » 4 °C) air {{temperature in the}} presence of an ambient or elevated (ambient + » 200 ppm) CO 2 concentration. The elevated temperature treatment delayed needle cold hardening in the autumn and slowed dehardening in the spring. At maximum hardiness, trees in the elevated temperature treatment were less hardy by about 7 °C than trees in the ambient temperature treatment. In gen-eral, trees exposed to elevated CO 2 were slightly less hardy during hardening and dehardening than trees exposed to ambi-ent CO 2. For trees in the elevated temperature treatments, date to 30 % burst of branch terminal buds was advanced by about 6 and 15 days {{in the presence of}} elevated CO 2 and ambient CO 2, respectively. After <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> started, however, the rate of in-crease in % <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> was slower in the elevated temperature treatments than in the ambient temperature treatments.

40|$|Summary According to {{prevailing}} theory, {{air temperature}} {{is the main}} environmental factor regulating the timing of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> of boreal and temperate trees. Air temperature has a dual role in this regulation. First, after the cessation of growth in au-tumn, prolonged exposure to chilling causes rest completion, i. e., removes the physiological growth-arresting conditions in-side the bud. After rest completion, prolonged exposure to warm conditions causes ontogenetic development leading to <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> or flowering. During the past three decades, several simulation models based on chilling and forcing have been de-veloped and tested. In recent modeling studies of the timing of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> in mature trees, the simpler thermal-time models that assume forcing starts on a fixed date in the spring have outper-formed the chilling-forcing models. We hypothesize that this discrepancy {{may be due to}} some element missing from the chilling-forcing models. We tested two new model formulations by introducing re-versing, temperature-driven elements that precede forcing and by fitting the models to seven historical time series of data of flowering and leaf <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> of common boreal tree species. In these tests, both of the new models were generally more accu-rate in predicting the timing of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> than a classical chill-ing-forcing model, but less accurate than the simple thermal-time model. We therefore conclude that besides chilling, other environmental factors are involved in the regulation of the tim-ing of <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> Further work is needed to determine if the regulatory factors derive from air temperature or from some other environmental condition such as changes in light condi-tions, like day length or night length...|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{elevated}} CO 2, clone {{and plant}} nutrition on bud dormancy of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) were examined. Sitka spruce seedlings were fumigated with ambient or elevated (ambient + 350 µmol mol– 1) concentrations of CO 2 in open-top chambers for three growing seasons. In 1991 and 1992, elevated CO 2 delayed <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> {{in the spring}} and advanced bud set in the autumn. The effect of the open-top chamber on the thermal requirement for <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> was greater than the effect of elevated CO 2 (50 and 30 day degrees (Dd), respectively). In a second study, four clones of Sitka spruce taken from two provenances, at 43 and 54 ° N, were fumigated with ambient or elevated CO 2. There was a large natural variation in the timing of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> and <b>bud</b> set among the clones. Elevated CO 2 had no effect on bud dormancy of the Skidegate a clone, but it reduced the growing season of the North Bend b clone by 20 days. In a third study, Sitka spruce seedlings growing in ambient or elevated CO 2, were supplied with one of three nutrient regimes, low (0. 1 x potential), medium (0. 5 x potential) or high (2. 0 x potential), using a method and solution based on the Ingestad technique. Elevated CO 2 did not affect bud dormancy in the high-nutrient treatment, but it reduced the growing season of plants in the low-nutrient treatment by 22 days. Increasing plant nutrient supply lengthened the growing season, plants flushed earlier {{in the spring and}} set bud later in the autumn. The effects of elevated CO 2 plus a 0, 2 or 4 °C climatic warming on the timing of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> and the subsequent risk of frost damage were assessed using a simulation model and meteorological data from three sites, Edinburgh, Braemar and Masset.

Consequently, several ex situ clone collections have been established throughout Europe for elm breeding and conservation.

Our aim was to analyse the variation in timing of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> and to acquire basic knowledge on the environmental control of this adaptive trait in European elms, under the hypothesis that DED susceptibility is related to spring phenology. The variation in the <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> date of European elms among collections and years was explained by a phenological model assuming that the thermal time required for <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> decreases exponentially with increasing chilling during winter down to a level where chilling requirement is fully met. According to the fitted curves, European elms have low dormancy and short chilling requirement for dormancy release. Although no simulation was performed, {{on the basis of}} the model applied we can hypothesise that under climate warming elms would flush earlier in most of Europe.

However, {{little is known about the}} effects of temporary water or light intensity constraints. We therefore studied the impact of temporary water restriction or light limitation on the branching and development of rose bush axes. Rooted cuttings of Rosa hybrida ‘Radrazz’ were grown until the secondary axes had ceased to elongate, in a greenhouse for water experiment and in growth chambers for light experiment. During the water experiment, the irrigation threshold was maintained at − 8 kPa to ensure that water was not limiting until the primary axis reached the floral bud visible stage. Plants were then subjected to water restriction for 0, 7, 14, 21 or 35 days, with an irrigation threshold of − 26 kPa. They were then returned to the initial conditions and grown without water constraint until the end of the experiment. During the light experiment, plants subjected to light limitation were illuminated with low-intensity light (91 μmol m− 2 s− 1) from cutting <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> until the floral bud visible stage (16 days), or to the petal color visible stage (27 days). Plants were then placed at high light intensity (580 μmol m− 2 s− 1). Control plants were maintained continuously in high-light intensity conditions. We found that, during constraint, a similar number (water restriction) or fewer (light limitation) <b>buds</b> <b>burst</b> than in control plants. When constraints were released, <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> rapidly increased to levels + 41 – 54 % higher than those of control plants for water-restricted plants and + 34 – 45 % higher than those of control plants for light-limited plants. Excess <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> occurred in the median zone of the primary axis. Flowering shoot number was 35 % and 22 % higher than control levels in plants subjected to 16 and 27 days of light limitation, respectively. Water limitation did not increase the number of flowering shoots despite the increase in <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> it induced, due to an increase in the number of blind shoots. Overall, our findings show, for the first time, that temporary water or light restrictions promote the branching and development of rose bush axes.

40|$|Key message: In mature black spruce, <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> {{process is}} {{anticipated}} by soil warming, while delayed by foliar applications of nitrogen; however, the effects depend on growth {{conditions at the}} site. Abstract: The observation of phenological events {{can be used as}} biological indicator of environmental changes, especially from the perspective of climate change. In boreal forests, the onset of the <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> is a key factor in the length of the growing season. With current climate change, the major factors limiting the growth of boreal trees (i. e., temperature and nitrogen availability) are changing and studies on mature trees are limited. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of soil warming and increased nitrogen (N) deposition on <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> of mature black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP]. From 2008 onwards, an experimental manipulation of these environmental growth conditions was conducted in two stands (BER and SIM) at different altitudes in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. An increase in soil temperature (H treatment) and a canopy application of artificial rain enriched with nitrogen (N treatment) were performed. Observations of bud phenology were made during May–July 2012 and 2013. In BER, H treatment caused an anticipation (estimated as 1 – 3 days); while N treatment, a delay (estimated as 1 – 2 days but only in 2012) in <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> No treatments effect was significant in SIM. It has been demonstrated that soil temperature and N availability can play an important role in affecting <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> in black spruce but the effects of these environmental factors on growth are closely linked with site conditions...|$|R
40|$|Des Douglas issus de boutures âgées de 9 il 12 mois ont été soumis à divers traitements lumineux et thermiques afin d’observer la capacité de débourrement de l’ensemble des bourgeons. En début d’expérience, tous les bourgeons étaient en repos apparent. Par rapport à une photopériode courte (9 h) un éclairement de 16 h (250 ụE m- 2 s- 1) stimule {{fortement}} le débourrement des bourgeons. Cette stimulation s’observe également pour un éclairement faible (40 ụE m- 2 s- 1) donné en complément de la période de 9 h. Ces résultats ont été confirmés chez des plants issus de semis et âgés de 4 ans où, de plus, un éclairement pendant 16 h accroît fortement le nombre de bourgeons réactivés. Une période de froid (5 °C) réactive tous les bourgeons d’une bouture si le traitement a duré 9 semaines. L’allongement de la pousse de première génération qui se produit dès la fin de la période froide est d’autant plus important que le froid a duré plus longtemps. Enfin, des températures élevées données en alternance (35 °C pendant 9 h et 25 °C pendant 15 h) durant 2 semaines accroissent notablement le débourrement des bourgeons. 1 et 3 semaines de ce traitement stimulent également, mais de façon moindre, le débourrement. Ces effets sont obtenus en régime d’alimentation hydrique et minérale non limitante. La discussion met l’accent sur l’hétérogénéité physiologique de la population de bourgeons d’un jeune plant révélée par des exigences différentes pour leur débourrement, en photo-périodes longues ou en températures froides ou en températures chaudes. The aim of {{this article}} was to describe and to measure the characteristics of the <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> of 9 to 12 month old cuttings of Pseudotsuga menziesii as a function of variations in photoperiod, light energy and temperature. At the beginning of the experiments, all the buds were seemingly in a rest state. Compared with a short photoperiod (9 h) a 16 h lighting period (250 ụE m- 2 s- 1) - accelerated and strongly stimulated the intensity of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> (fig. 1). The same result, although less intense, was observed when weak lighting (40 ụE m- 2 s- 1) was given as a complement to the 9 h period (fig. 1). These results have been confirmed on 4 years old plants on which a high energy (430 ụE m- 2 s- 1) - 16 h lighting period strongly enhanced the number of reactivated buds (fig. 2) as compared with the reactivated buds numbered on plants placed under the same photoperiod but with less intense light (250 ụE m- 2 s- 1). On those plants placed in 9 h photoperiod, only intense light slightly enhanced the <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> A cold <b>period</b> (5 °C) accelerated the growth of all buds of the cuttings if the treatment lasted 9 weeks. For shorter cold periods, the intensity of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> depended upon the duration of the stay at cold temperature (fig. 3). The elongation of the shoot of the first generation which occured immediately after the cold period was higher when the cold period was longer (fig. 4). Finally, high temperatures given alternatively (35 °C during 9 h and 25 °C during 15 h) for 2 weeks enhanced appreciably the <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> 1 or 3 weeks of this treatment were less effective (fig. 5). These effects were obtained in non limiting conditions of water and mineral nutrition. Whatever the culture conditions, a slow growth phase took place immediately after a rapid elongation period. This was morphologically visible by the formation of scaly buds or, in some cases, by a few scales surrounding green buds. We discuss the physiological heterogeneity {{of the population of the}} buds of a cutting as revealed by their different photoperiodic or temperature needs for their <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> These factors are not essential for the growth of all the buds, but they synchronize and hasten the renewal of the growth.

40|$|ABSTRACT Temperate climate {{fruit trees}} often exhibit uneven budding and flowering, {{due to the}} low number of {{chilling}} hours that determine the occurrence of dormancy and its depth. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the depth of bud dormancy in peach tree cultivars and evaluate the efficiency of the tetrazolium test for dormancy and comparing with biological test. Branches of the cultivars Aurora 1, Chimarrita, Chiripá, Coral, Eldorado, Granada, Leonense, Maciel, Marli, Premier, and Vanguard were collected between May and August 2008 at two locations: Curitiba and Lapa. The evaluation of dormancy was performed using a biological test of single node cuttings through the parameters: average time for <b>bud</b> <b>burst,</b> velocity of <b>bud</b> <b>burst,</b> final rate of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> and rate of vigorous <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> For the tetrazolium test, 300 mg of buds was used and the color intensity readings were obtained using a spectrophotometer. The peach tree cultivars evaluated differ in the intensity of dormancy in late fall. The most intense endodormancy cultivars found were: Chiripá, Leonense and Eldorado cultivars, and the weaker cultivars found were: Aurora 1 and Maciel. The tetrazolium test was efficient at estimating the intensity of dormancy in peach trees when the occurrence of cold was suitable for installation endodormancy. At a location with the lowest occurrence of cold (Curitiba), the tetrazolium test did not simulated successfully the biological test results...|$|R
40|$|Warmer spring temperatures, as {{caused by}} climate warming, {{led to an}} earlier <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> in spring and an {{extended}} growing season in many temperate and boreal tree species. But to which extent will the phenology of these species keep tracking rising temperatures in future? Temperature, photoperiod and degree of winter chilling are the main environmental factors controlling tree spring phenology. Contrary to the high inter-annual variation of spring temperatures, photoperiod is an astronomical, weather independent environmental cue for the progression of the season. Photoperiodic control of spring development prevents trees from flushing too early under mild winter and early spring temperatures, before the period of potentially fatal freezing damage is over. Photoperiod sensitive species are therefore likely to stop tracking climate warming the closer the temperature modulated bud break is shifted toward the genetically fixed photoperiod threshold. I assessed the photoperiod sensitivity of spring bud swelling and <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> in several common temperate tree species using growth chamber experiments with variable photoperiod × temperature interaction and evaluated commonly used phenological models to represent these interactions. Short photoperiods delayed <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> in late successional species to various degrees, whereas no distinct photoperiod sensitivity of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> was observed in early successional and exotic (ornamental) species, which are thus mostly temperature controlled. Climate warming will thus not necessarily lead to progressively longer growing seasons in late successional species, as is often assumed...|$|R
40|$|Main {{conclusion}} Epigenetic memory {{affects the}} timing of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> phenology and the expression of bud burstrelated genes in genetically identical Norway spruce epitypes in a manner usually associated with ecotypes. In Norway spruce, a temperature-dependent epigenetic memory established during embryogenesis affects {{the timing of}} <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> and <b>bud</b> set in a reproducible and predictable manner. We hypothesize that the clinal variation in these phenological traits, which is associated with adaptation to growth under frost-free conditions, has an epigenetic component. In Norway spruce, dehydrins (DHNs) {{have been associated with}} extreme frost tolerance. DHN transcript levels decrease gradually prior to flushing, a time when trees are highly sensitive to frost. Furthermore, EARLY BUD BREAK 1 genes (EBB 1) and the FT-TFL 1 - LIKE 2 -gene (PaFTL 2) were previously suggested to be implied in control of bud phenology. Here we report an analysis of transcript levels of 12 DHNs, 3 EBB 1 genes and FTL 2 in epitypes of the same genotype generated at different epitype-inducing temperatures, before and during spring <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> Earlier flushing of epitypes originating from embryos developed at 18 C as compared to 28 C, was associated with differential expression of these genes between epitypes and between buds and last year’s needles. The majority of these genes showed significantly different expressions between epitypes in at least one time point. The general trend in DHN expression pattern in buds showed the expected reduction in transcript levels when approaching flushing, whereas, surprisingly, transcript levels peaked later in needles, mainly at the moment of <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> Collectively, our results demonstrate that the epigenetic memory of temperature during embryogenesis affects <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> phenology and expression of the bud burst-related DHN, EBB 1 and FTL 2 genes in genetically identical Norway spruce epitypes...|$|R

Resistant mature trees had a higher radial growth rate than susceptible trees, especially during periods of budworm defoliation. Clones from resistant trees grew larger crowns than clones from susceptible trees, whereas stem base diameter at the ground line and height did not differ. Half-sib seedling progeny from resistant trees had larger stem diameter, height, and total biomass than progeny from susceptible trees. Mean 5 -year radial growth increment of mature trees was more strongly correlated with growth of seedlings than with growth of clones.

For the future climate we included two different scenarios (RCP 8. 5, RCP 2. 6) each of them containing a triple set with minimum, medium and maximum temperature increase. The time period between 1981 and 2010 as the last three decades in the observed data was chosen as reference. In general we found an acceleration of the phenological development (all main phases) mainly beginning in the late 1980 s. For the three-decade period between 2031 and 2060 this acceleration will reach 11 ± 311 ± 3 days in the RCP 8. 5 -scenario. The acceleration for the other stages behaved similarly and results in an earlier harvest ripeness of 13 ± 113 ± 1  days. Since a warmer spring in general leads to earlier <b>bud</b> <b>burst,</b> but does not reduce the risk of frost events during this period in the same manner, changes in the risk of spring frost damage were relatively small. For the coming decades this risk will not decrease for all traditional German viticultural regions in the RCP 8. 5 -scenarios; on the contrary, our results suggest it is likely to increase. The results showed an increasing spring frost risk not only for the debated “upcoming” potential viticultural areas in eastern Germany, an effect which will partly also reach the southernmost viticultural areas.
