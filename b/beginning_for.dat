The belief was that for an infant to survive a caesarian section was a miracle, and thus a fitting <b>beginning</b> <b>for</b> a future saint.|$|E

In their ninth game of the season, however, the Hokies suffered their first loss, falling 21–28 to the Pittsburgh Panthers. The next week, Tech suffered an even closer loss, losing to Syracuse in triple overtime despite a record performance from Tech quarterback Bryan Randall, who accumulated 504passing yards and fivetouchdown passes.|$|E

5|$|Data {{processing}} {{begins with}} indexing the reflections. This means identifying {{the dimensions of}} the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in reciprocal space. A byproduct of indexing is to determine the symmetry of the crystal, i.e., its space group. Some space groups can be eliminated from the <b>beginning.</b> <b>For</b> example, reflection symmetries cannot be observed in chiral molecules; thus, only 65 space groups of 230 possible are allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral. Indexing is generally accomplished using an autoindexing routine. Having assigned symmetry, the data is then integrated. This converts the hundreds of images containing the thousands of reflections into a single file, consisting of (at the very least) records of the Miller index of each reflection, and an intensity for each reflection (at this state the file often also includes error estimates and measures of partiality (what part of a given reflection was recorded on that image)).|$|E

5|$|The Open Door is {{the second}} studio album by American rock band Evanescence. It was {{released}} on September 25, 2006, through Wind-up Records. The initial date for the record to be made available for purchase was in March 2006, but was changed {{as a result of}} guitarist Terry Balsamo's stroke, the loss of the band's former manager, and Will Boyd's and Ben Moody's departure from the group. The record symbolizes a new <b>beginning</b> <b>for</b> the band, incorporating new elements into their previous musical styles, including gothic rock, symphonic rock and pop music as well as the use of choirs on several songs. The writing process for the album took over 18 months to complete; most of the songs were written by Amy Lee and Terry Balsamo, while production was handled by Dave Fortman.|$|E

25|$|Father Raffeiner was {{actively}} engaged in establishing the parish. Back then a large German-speaking colony was located east of the Bowery, necessitating the establishment of religious services in German. Raffeiner first temporarily rented a carpenter shop on Delancey Street for services.

25|$|Other early ethologists, such as Charles O. Whitman, Oskar Heinroth, Wallace Craig and Julian Huxley, instead {{concentrated}} on behaviours {{that can be}} called instinctive, or natural, in that they occur in all members of a species under specified circumstances. Their <b>beginning</b> <b>for</b> studying the behaviour of a new species was to construct an ethogram (a description of the main types of behaviour with their frequencies of occurrence). This provided an objective, cumulative data-base of behaviour, which subsequent researchers could check and supplement.|$|E
25|$|Related activities, {{just after}} WWII, {{included}} a Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG), first in Greece. Another MAAG went to French Indochina in 1950.

MAAG activities were intended to be largely advisory (i.e., noncombat), while the Special Forces was designed from the <b>beginning</b> <b>for</b> training and leading guerrillas of the host nation against an occupier.|$|E

25|$|The {{problems}} are especially acute in some northern regions of France. The French government no longer disposes {{of chemical weapons}} at sea. For this reason, piles of untreated chemical weapons accumulated. In 2001, it became evident that the pile stored at a depot in Vimy was unsafe; {{the inhabitants of the}} neighboring town were evacuated, and the pile moved, using refrigerated trucks and under heavy guard, to a military camp in Suippes.

A four coin set with face values of $30, $75, $150, and $300 respectively were complemented by the high quality artwork that adorned these luxury items. Famed artists such as Robert Bateman and Glen Loates contributed to these collections with polar bear and bird designs. The issue price for these collections was around $1,990 and the casing was a walnut or burgundy (for 1994) case with a black suede four hole insert and a Certificate of Authenticity.|$|E
