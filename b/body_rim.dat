30|$|The {{meaning of}} this change of {{scenario}} becomes clear if we refer to Gibson’s idea that objects, even the simplest and most trivial, contain more than one affordance. In {{the case of a}} common coffee-cup the visual affordances offered to our motor system concern the handle, central <b>body,</b> upper <b>rim,</b> etc. Consequently, observing it “will determine the activation of several neural populations in the upper intraparietal area (UIA), each of which codes a specific affordance. It is probable that these “proposals” for action be sent to the F 5 area, triggering authentic potential motor acts. Now the choice of how to act will not just depend on the intrinsic properties of the object in question (shape, size, inclination, etc.) but also on what we intend to do with it, and the use functions we acknowledge it has, etc. In the case of the cup, for example, we will grasp it in different ways depending on whether we want to pick it up to drink coffee, rinse it or, more simply, move it. And already in the first case our grip may be different according to whether we are afraid of being burnt, if there are any objects surrounding the cup, our habits, and whether we are inclined to respect good manners, etc.” (Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia 2006, p. 36).|$|R

40|$|This study {{combines}} a theoretical modelling of dexterity with a practical apprenticeship in glass-working {{in order to}} examine a group of core-formed glass alabastra from Mediterranean Group I (c. 525 to c. 400 BCE). Core-formed vessels were made by forming glass around an internal mould which was scraped out after the vessel had cooled. The core-forming tradition lasted from c. 1500 BCE until c. 100 BCE. Mediterranean Group I is of interest because of the wide variety of consistency displayed in <b>body</b> shaping, <b>rim</b> and handle making, and decoration. To understand this variety it was necessary to undertake a theoretical and practical investigation of skill. The theoretical investigation revealed that skill has been conventionally analysed in terms of knowledge. This cognition-based analysis ignores the dimension of moving, specifically of the skilled gesture and the process of becoming dexterous. The practical apprenticeship demonstrated that this process, as a kinaesthetic experience, is value-positive - that is to say, it gives rise to value judgements on artefact feature, gesture in synergy with tools and materials, and craft working behaviour. This remodelling of skill allows one to form a gestural as opposed to a feature-based artefact typology and in so doing to identify, not simply distinct communities of practice, but different types of communities whose judgements arose out of the experience of becoming dexterous. Redefined in this way skilled making can be repositioned within archaeological theory as a central mode of interaction with the material world, a mode which has the intrinsic potential to generate value and social meaning...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} {{four and a half}} years this group has been {{involved}} in a programme of development and testing of methods for the study of organic residues in archaeological ceramics. The analytical approach used is based on solvent extraction of powdered potsherds to release lipids absorbed in the ceramic fabric, with gas chromatography (GC) and combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) being used to characterise andquantify the individual components of the residues. Our most recent work has focused on an assemblage of more than sixty reconstructed vessels of Late Saxon/early medievaldate for which full or partial profiles were available. Analysis of potsherds sampled from different parts of these vessels, e. g. <b>rim,</b> <b>body</b> and base, have shown that different concentrations of lipid can exist in different parts of a vessel. This observation has important consequences for the sampling of potsherds for organic residue analysis. More significantly, these results indicate that the variation in the concentration of lipid in different parts of a vessel may reflect the way in which the vessel was used in antiquity. This paper discusses the results obtained from preliminary laboratory simulation experiments which have been carried out using replica vessels to provide supporting evidence for this potentially new approach to interpreting vessel use. Consideration will also be given to the possibility of using potsherds from these replica vessels in laboratory experiments aimed at simulating the decay of absorbed lipids during burial...|$|R
40|$|Discrete bodies {{which may}} be {{designated}} cytochondria occupy {{the greater part of}} the cytoplasm of liver cells. A part, but not all, of these bodies have the characteristics of mitochondria. They consist of a rim which stains deeply and a central part which stains faintly or remains unstained. In liver cells about portal spaces, in foci of regeneration, and in tumor cells the rims of the cytochondria stain with basic dyes and contain ribonucleic acid or related substances. With increasing accumulation of basophile substances about cytochondria as the central veins are approached, these bodies aggregate to form clumps or orient themselves with palisade-like arrangment in two rows just within the margins of the liver cell columns. With aggregation of the cytochondria that are surrounded by basophile material, other cytochondria in the same cells are devoid of this material and wholly acidophile. With chromatolysis (disappearance of basophile substance) caused by dimethylaminoazobeiizene (butter yellow) cytochondria lose their peripheral basophilia and stain only with acid dyes. When ribonucleic acid is removed from fixed liver tissue by ribonuclease, cytochondria lose their affinity for basic stains and become acidophile. Of the cytochondria that are surrounded by ribonucleic acid or related substances part have the characteristics of mitochondria. Under the influence of butter yellow cytochondria may become greatly swollen and intensely acidophile in the center though they retain their basophile <b>rim.</b> These swollen <b>bodies</b> in part at least have the reactions of mitochondria. In tumor cells of hepatomas mitochondria are smaller and less abundant than in parenchymatous cells of the liver, and accompanying them are bodies of similar size which do not react as mitochondria.

40|$|Berry sensory {{assessment}} (BSA) is {{a technique}} that can help grapegrowers and winemakers make decisions about harvest date and grape product allocation. BSA as a structured technique {{has been used by}} grapegrowers, winemakers and researchers for the last thirteen years. However the number of studies reporting results of the effect of viticultural practices on berry sensory characteristics and wine quality is limited. This thesis examined the BSA technique through four different studies. Study one is a combined review literature review and industry survey paper in which the methodology of Berry Sensory Assessment is presented and the research conducted using BSA is discussed. It also presents the results of a survey channeled to Australian grapegrowers and Australian and New Zealand winemakers about their experience using BSA, their perceptions on its use and their suggestions for improving the methodology. It was evident from the survey that 90 % of grapegrowers and winemakers use BSA and they want to understand the link between BSA and wine quality. These results demonstrated the importance of BSA for wine producers and the need for further improvement. The aim of study number two was to determine if berry sensory attributes and berry compositional variables could predict wine sensory attributes, wine compositional variables and wine quality in Shiraz. The analyses of berry and wine sensory attributes, compositional measures and wine quality using partial least squares regression and Pearson’s correlations from two seasons identified several relationships between berry sensory attributes and wine sensory attributes and quality. A significant negative relationship was identified between seed bitterness and wine savoury spice flavour for the two seasons. The berry sensory attribute pulp detachment from the skin was identified as a predictor of various wine sensory attributes (eg. the harder to detach skin from the pulp the higher intensity for wine <b>body</b> colour, <b>rim</b> colour and dark berry aroma) and wine quality scores in the season 2011. The aim of study number three was to determine if berries stored at - 20 °C for three months could be used instead of fresh berries to conduct BSA. Being able to conduct BSA on frozen berries could help to reduce sensory fatigue in assessors by allowing them to evaluate samples over a longer time period and to schedule BSA away from the busy harvest period. The results of this study determined that sensory profile from Shiraz berries differed in five sensory attributes – pulp sweetness, pulp fresh fig flavour, skin colour extraction, skin bitterness and seed astringency - between fresh and frozen berries at three times of harvest, preventing the evaluation of these five sensory attributes in Shiraz frozen berries. Study number four aimed to determine the effect of three rootstocks on sensory and compositional differences of Shiraz grapes and wines in comparison to a nongrafted control. The trial was conducted over two seasons. Berry and wine sensory and compositional {{differences were found between the}} grafted treatments and the nongrafted control. PCA was able to discriminate the wines from the four treatments in three groups of aroma compounds (acetate esters, ethyl esters and higher alcohols) in both seasons. The results of wine quality scores from two seasons showed that the un-grafted treatment had the lowest quality and 110 Richter and Schwarzmann the highest. The findings from this study identified relationships between the sensory and compositional variables in berries and wines that are affecting wine quality. It also showed that that the use of rootstocks has an impact on berry and wine sensory and compositional characteristics. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|U istraživanjima kasnosrednjovjekovnoga dvora knezova Iločkih pronađena je raznovrsna antička materijalna ostavština koja obogaćuje dosadašnje skromne spoznaje o Cucciumu i limesu u hrvatskome Podunavlju. U iskopavanjima 2002. godine otkriven je paljevinski grob s drvenom arhitekturom u kojem su se nalazili prilozi dvojakoga podrijetla. Autohtono podrijetlo u latenskoj kulturi mlađega željeznoga doba pokazuju lonci zaobljenoga tijela izrađeni rukom i zdjela S-profilacije. Sjevernoitalskoga podrijetla su zdjelica tankih stijenki, keramička svjetiljka, staklena posuda te ostali prilozi koji zajedno s Klaudijevim novcem datiraju grob u sredinu 1. st. Na osnovi nalaza posuda izrađenih u latenskim tradicijama pretpostavlja se kako je u grobu bila pokopana osoba starosjedilačkoga podrijetla, dok importirani prilozi svjedoče o ranoj romanizaciji južne Panonije i dunavskoga limesa. O postojanju složenoga pogrebnoga rituala svjedoče izdvojeni ostaci kultiviranih biljaka domaćega i uvoznoga podrijetla koje su bile položene u lonce. The high Danube bank near Ilok, {{which is}} {{situated}} on the western slopes of Fruška gora, was continuously settled in all prehistoric periods, and after that - as the finds analyzed herein indicate - in the Roman time, but Ilok experienced its peak in the Late Middle Ages, {{in the period of}} Nikola and his son Lovro. The beginning of excavations in Ilok’s upper town is particularly significant for reveal of the topography of Roman Ilok, which remained almost completely unknown due to a small number of finds. Data about the Roman settlement of Ilok (Cuccium) are preserved in several Itineraries, with different forms for the settlement’s name. Thus Notitia Dignitatum mentions two cavalry units, Cuneus equitum Promotorum and Equites Sagittarii, in Cuccium of the 4 th century. The excavations of the Institute of Archaeology in Zagreb began in 2001 in the extension of the eastern wing of Odescalchi Castle, to be continued in 2002 towards the west to encompass the lawn in front of the castle (Fig. 1). In preloess layer SJ 224 (10 YR 4 / 3) {{in the southern part of}} the excavated area, filling SJ 229 was isolated. This filling is the first in a number of preserved fillings of the larger prehistoric pit SJ 306 which by finds was dated to the beginning of the Early Iron Age. In prehistoric filling SJ 229 another younger rectangular filling SJ 230 (5 Y 4 / 3) was identified, whose western edge was damaged by recent burial in lime pit SJ 216, whereas the southern part lies outside the margin of the excavated area. Filling SJ 230 is part of the Early Roman grave SJ 273. Along the southern profile of the dig in filling SJ 230 a smaller burial SJ 270 and filling SJ 269, which caused no major damage to the grave (Fig. 5), were identified. The bottom of the grave with finds remained preserved, and the lack of incinerated human remains is possibly due to the fact that they are situated in the southern part of the grave, which has not yet been excavated, even though it is highly possible that they were destroyed in an earlier intervention in the grave filling. All grave goods were found in the eastern part of the grave (Fig. 2, Fig. 4). In the middle of the grave, close to the top of SJ 230, a hollow shafted iron axe (Pl. 2, 7) was found, which on account of its position compared to other finds is supposed to have entered the grave by digging through the older prehistoric strata, thus not belonging to the grave goods. On the bottom of the grave, filling SJ 268 (2. 5 Y 5 / 6) was isolated which belongs to the thin layer of preserved wooden architecture (Fig. 2 - 3), on whose remains in the northeastern corner of the grave two hand-made pots with a rounded body and a flat rim and bottom (Pl. 1, 1 - 2) were found, as well as fragments of a wheel-made bowl with an S profile (Pl. 2, 1). In the corner of the grave, fragments of a dark-gray bowl with thin walls (Pl. 2, 6) and a play-token of dark blue glass paste (Pl. 2, 1) were found. A part of the bowl was also in a pot laid slightly more to the south (Pl. 1, 2). Around both pots numerous seeds were identified, which is why the complete content of the filling around the vessels and their filling is flotated. In the eastern part of the grave there were fragments of a glass vessel, probably a funnel or a glass (Pl. 2, 4). Fragments of a ceramic lamp (Pl. 2, 5), a bronze earring (Pl. 1, 3), a fragment of a bronze needle (Pl. 1, 5) and an iron rivet (Pl. 2, 8) were found in the southeastern excavated part of the grave. Also in that part of the grave a bronze artifact, which probably represents a vessel’s handle fastening system (Pl. 1, 4), and Claudius coin (Pl. 1, 6) were found. Beneath the remains of planks, filling SJ 272 (5 Y 5 / 4) was isolated, which contained no grave goods. The excavated part of grave SJ 273 is rectangular-shaped with rounded corners with dimensions of 2. 12 m (W-E) and 1. 88 m (N-S up to the dig profile). The results of research indicate that all the grave goods were lain on the bottom of a wooden case, the existence of which is proved not only by SJ 268, but also by four uncovered post holes, one in each corner (SJ 277 and SJ 295), and two more in the middle of the western and eastern side of the grave respectively (SJ 275 and SJ 293). Although the southern part of the grave was not excavated, it can be assumed that post holes were in the southeastern and southwestern corner of the grave. All the holes are quadrangular, and in the bottom part they become octagonal to make post driving easier. The results of floatation of part of the filling around the ceramic vessels laying in the northeastern part of the grave and the filling of pots indicated the existence of a complex funeral custom which is reflected in the presence of a relatively large number of isolated cultivated plants. Archaeobotanical analysis showed that among grave goods there were cereals (barley, millet, and different types of wheat), leguminous plants (lentil and vetch) as well as a large number of “fruit” objects (melon/cucumber, fig, apple/ pear cherry/sour cherry/sloe, plum, elder and vinegrape). The fig and probably the melon were imported to the Ilok since they are cultivated in warmer (sub) Mediterranean areas, whereas the other sorts were probably cultivated in the surroundings of Ilok. All of the cereals and vetch are carbonized, i. e. they were intentionally or unintentionally burned. Apparently they were laid onto a funeral pile. The remaining “fruit” finds were calcified, i. e. they were laid into the grave fresh or dried, probably when laying the human remains and other grave goods. With the exception of the fig, which had to be dried due to long transport from the Mediterranean region, the remaining fruits could have been laid fresh. Apples, pears, plums, sourberries and elder berries as well as vinegrapes and melons ripen at the same time of the year, i. e. in the early autumn, which suggests that the burial took place in that season. Still one has to keep in mind that “fruit” objects could have been kept in dried state for a relatively long time. The remains of a Roman grave were found in the excavations of 2002, indicating the existence of a cemetery, which had been unknown until now. The grave contained a cremation burial, with grave goods that were laid on the bottom in the northeastern corner and along the eastern side of the wooden case, rectangular in shape, which was probably made of oakwood (Fig. 4). The answers to questions on the chronological position, ethnic determination and the origin of the finds shall be given after an analysis of the grave goods, which can be divided in two groups, the first represented by three ceramic vessels made following the tradition of the La Tène culture, and the other group of finds which are northern Italic imports and which, along with the coin, make dating of the grave possible. These finds consist of a ceramic bowl with thin walls, a glass vessel, a ceramic lamp, a bronze earring and a glass paste play-token. The same origin can be assumed concerning the finds that were preserved only in fragments such as a bronze handle fastening system of a vessel and a needle. On the basis of their shape and technological characteristics, the two hand-made pots with rounded bodies and the wheel-made, S-profiled bowl are connected with the tradition of the La Tène culture. The dark gray to dark brown pots with an admixture of quartz and chuff in abundance, have a rounded <b>body,</b> a flat <b>rim</b> beneath which there is a horizontal groove and a flat bottom (Pl. 1, 1 - 2). These are situla form pots, for which there are numerous parallels in the Late La Tène Scordiscs settlements in eastern Slavonia and Syrmia, found also in Early Roman strata and graves. Of similar origin is also the S-profiled, wheel-made bowl with a rich admixture of quartz (Pl. 2, 1) that was also found in the northeastern corner of the grave. The hand-made pots with rounded bodies and the S-profiled bowl represent the Late La Tène heritage of the Scordiscs and testify to the presence of an autochthonous population in the Early Roman sites of the 1 st century, whose traditions are the strongest in the shapes, techniques and methods of decorating coarse pottery. As indicated by the finds from the settlement layers in Vinkovci, Osijek and Srijemska Mitrovica, the local craftsmen continued the production of recognizable shapes, thus satisfying the needs of the indigenous population. Those forms were decorated by familiar motifs by applying combed or broom-shaped ornaments and by polishing. Ceramic ware with autochthonous features was preserved until the period of the Flavians, suggesting the existence of indigenous peregrine communities which preserved the achievements of their own material culture up until the end of the 1 st century, but due to intensified romanization in the 2 nd century this autochthonous trait The second and larger group of finds from the grave testifying|$|R
