500|$|There is also {{debate over}} whether or not a-consciousness and p-consciousness always co-exist or if they can exist separately. [...] Although p-consciousness without a-consciousness is more widely accepted, there have been some {{hypothetical}} examples of A without P. Block for instance suggests the case of a “zombie” that is computationally identical to a person but without any subjectivity. However, he remains somewhat skeptical concluding [...] "I don’t know whether there are any actual cases of A-consciousness without P-consciousness, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> I have illustrated their conceptual possibility." ...|$|E

[...] The chorus includes a clip of Bale saying [...] "it's fucking distracting", and [...] "What don't you fuckin' understand?". The sound collage includes clips of Barbra Streisand from a 2006 exchange with a supporter of former-President George W. Bush, making it sound as though Streisand is arguing with Bale. Piane told the Associated Press: [...] "I don't know if Christian Bale is enjoying it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> he does. I think I've taken something that maybe made him look really bad and turned it into something that all these people are enjoying." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{one last}} {{interview}} with Feletti—who again said almost nothing, citing a sacred oath—Carboni {{informed him that}} so {{far as he could}} see, there was no evidence to support his version of events. Feletti replied: [...] "I commiserate with the Mortara parents for their painful separation from their son, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> that the prayers of the innocent soul succeed in having God reunite them all in the Christian religion... As for my punishment, not only do I place myself in the Lord's hands, but I would argue that any government would recognise the legitimacy of my action."

500|$|Around midday, Rupert {{was joined}} on Marston Moor by Newcastle, {{accompanied}} by a mounted troop of [...] "gentleman volunteers" [...] only. Rupert greeted him by saying, [...] "My Lord, I wish you had come sooner with your forces, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> we shall yet have a glorious day." [...] Newcastle counselled that the three allied armies, with separate garrisons, recruiting areas and lines of communication to protect, would eventually separate. He also suggested waiting for a force of 3,000 under Colonel Clavering and collected garrisons amounting to another 2,000 to join the Royalist army. Rupert was adamant that the King's letter (which he never showed to Newcastle) was a command to engage and defeat the enemy immediately. Furthermore, Rupert wished {{to compensate for the}} Royalists' numerical inferiority by catching the enemy unawares, and before further Parliamentarian reinforcements could increase their superiority in numbers.|$|E

Moffat criticises [...] "the [...] government talk about the specially talented needing more education, but that's absurd, the equivalent of hospitals for the healthy." [...] Moffat expected that teachers would find the show funny because it [...] "has certain notes of accuracy", recognising familiar myths such as the dead teacher and teachers' contempt for their pupils. Moffat continued to say that teachers would [...] "also recognise the pathological preference for science over arts and all that league-table shit. An official teaching organisation couldn't say, 'It's a very faithful portrayal,' <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> they'd say, 'It's a comedy series. Why take it seriously?'

500|$|Following {{a ten-year}} absence of nighttime-run stages, {{the first two}} Special Stages of the event were held on Thursday night. They were the first night stages {{scheduled}} in the rally since 1997. Throughout the day it had rained, and although it had stopped before the race began, the roads were still very wet and slippery. In discussing the day's weather, Grönholm said that he expected the stages that night to be difficult, and added, [...] "I hope this time we can take the right tyres, we were always {{a little bit on}} the wrong side – it’s not easy, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> we will manage to get it right this time." [...] Earlier in the day, the crews had driven a shakedown stage in Mauves; however, due to a large number of fans and spectators along the route the shakedown was stopped early, and some crews including Loeb and co-driver Daniel Elena were forced to carry out last-minute testing and necessary changes to their cars on the main roads back to Valence. Though forty-nine crews registered in the rally, only forty-seven actually competed. Privateers François Duval driving a , and Angelo Villa in a [...] failed to start the event.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from Moncton, Schmirler felt physically well, but suffered a setback when a CAT scan revealed spots around her lungs. The {{decision was made}} not to proceed with further chemotherapy, but she continued with the orthomolecular therapy. She {{had been scheduled to}} work the 2000 Scott Tournament of Hearts, but was unable to do so. She faxed a statement from the hospital, which was read by TSN's Vic Rauter. [...] "I'm still fighting hard and I still hope {{to make it to the}} Brier, not playing but talking. For Saskatchewan, I was hoping to be in your green shoes (at the Scott). But keep things in perspective. There are other things in life besides curling, which I have found. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> to be on the curling trail again next year. And I'll see you all in Sudbury (the next Scott site) in 2001. Your curling friend, Sandra." [...] However, the optimism in her statement belied the seriousness of her condition. She had been moved to palliative care. She died in her sleep at the Pasqua Hospital Palliative Care Unit on the morning of March 2, 2000 at age 36.|$|E

500|$|In {{the third}} round of the League Cup, Arsenal faced Derby County at Pride Park. Wenger made several first team changes to give his younger players playing time; Arsenal ran out 2–1 winners, a {{performance}} where [...] "every touch by a Derby player was greeted with ironic cheers." [...] However, the team were beaten comprehensively in the next round to Chelsea at Highbury, losing 0–5. The result inflicted Arsenal's biggest defeat in over eight years and Wenger defended his team selection, virtually a 'second team': [...] "I knew before the game that this kind of thing might happen. You only had to look at the team sheets. If we had won I would still have gone on playing the same side because the players need the experience." [...] Bergkamp, who was rested for the match, echoed his manager's comments: [...] "We had a lot of young players on the field against Chelsea and, although they were feeling very down after losing like that, they will learn from it. To be honest, the scoreline doesn't mean anything, whether it was 1–0 or 5–0. The supporters will feel bad <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> they understand Saturday will be a different game [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Coppola's {{first three}} films examine {{feminine}} self-definition and maturation, usually in privileged circumstance. Lost in Translation (2003) depicts an encounter and brief friendship between two lonely Americans in a luxurious Tokyo hotel; Marie Antoinette (2006), a stylized biopic of the eponymous queen, examined her loneliness. Somewhere examines similar themes {{of success and}} isolation, but from a male perspective. The film explores Marco's seclusion and depression despite his outward professional success and the resulting wealth and fame. He appears to suffer from anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure, but the film itself is reticent in suggesting its causes. [...] "He believes he's nothing", summarized film critic Roger Ebert, [...] "and it appears he's correct". The film's opening shot, a Ferrari circling a race-track {{in and out of}} a stationary camera position, its whine and roar rising and falling, establishes the theme of ennui. The sequence's length also offers a visual cue from Coppola to relax, observe and withhold expectations. Coppola said she wanted to hint at this with a simple camera set-up, [...] "so you're alone with this guy and not aware that it's a movie. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> it's a welcome contrast to the style of most movies out there. Something that gives you a chance to take a breath".|$|E
500|$|Chelsea manager Mourinho was {{primarily}} concerned with the fitness of his squad {{in the aftermath of}} the match, in particular Ballack, who was substituted with an injury early in the match: [...] "He had a kick in the muscle and he couldn't run <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> he will be back soon, we have quite a few players not in condition and we need players back, so I hope it's not a big deal." [...] He felt that the fitness of the two squads was the decisive factor in the match: [...] "Today our bench was not very good, with some kids, Liverpool could inject fresh blood at the same time as some of my players became really tired. They were broken. They were in better condition than us, you could see the difference between Frank Lampard and Sissoko." [...] Mourinho was also unconcerned about his team's form heading into the start of the season: [...] "Liverpool had more intensity and pace, qualities that make a team better. They had that and we didn't. We had a big percentage of the ball possession, but Liverpool defended with intensity and looked dangerous when they counter-attacked. I keep saying they are a difficult team to beat and they can go to every game with an ambition to win. They are a good team but over 10 months of competition we will be there." ...|$|E

As she continues to chant about making love in apocalyptic circumstances, [...] "So when the world's at war / Let our love heal us all", she projects a universal [...] "all you need is love" [...] feeling, as noted by Jillian Mapes. In the second verse, Beyoncé sings, [...] "Hey! I don't know much about guns but I ... I've been shot by you", as she pushes the final word [...] "you" [...] up at a full octave. She then continues: [...] "Hey! And I don't know when I'm gonna die, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> that I'm gonna die by you / Hey! And I don't know much about fighting, but I, I know I will fight for you / Hey! Just when I ball up my fist, I realize that I'm laying right next to you". According to Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times, these lines are intended to show that love conquers all. The song ends with an intense electric guitar solo.|$|E
500|$|Chris Coghill {{was cast}} as Whitney's abuser Tony on 20 June 2008. Upon {{accepting}} the role, he commented: [...] "Shona doesn't act, or look, {{like a little}} child. Which helps." [...] He has added of their off-screen relationship: [...] "Shona's fantastic to work with. She's very natural, very instinctive and a natural actress. There isn't any uncomfortable feeling at all." [...] Having undergone a thorough characterisation session, Coghill began shooting on 30 June 2008, and first appeared on-screen on 12 September 2008. Coghill has explained that Tony began grooming Whitney {{as soon as he}} met Bianca, ingratiating himself so as to become the family's [...] "hero figure" [...] and [...] "saviour". Discussing his character's relationship with Whitney, Coghill explained that: [...] "The lie that Tony has spun to Whitney is that as soon as she's 16 they'll run away together and start a new life. But Tony's the type of paedophile who preys on younger children. Whitney is beginning to pass her sell-by date with him. [...] He feels like he's losing his little girl but needs to keep Whitney under his control and not speak out." [...] Coghill stated that: [...] "This is the most challenging role I have had to play. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> by EastEnders tackling the sensitive issue of child abuse it can raise awareness." [...] When asked how she felt about the abuse storyline, Palmer commented: [...] "It would be brilliant if it helped somebody. If one person out there who's been abused saw [...] {{go out of their way}} to make it easier on the victim – Whitney's evidence is given by video link – it will be worth it." ...|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin {{reported}} that past season premieres of 30 Rock {{had a solid}} track record as being the worst episodes of the season, nonetheless Rabin found [...] "The Fabian Strategy" [...] hilarious and breaking that barrier. He wrote that Matt Damon has been great on the show as Carol; however, his only complaint was Carol's character flaw as being too sensitive. Rabin, who has complained [...] "extensively" [...] about Jenna's character in the past, said the character was in [...] "fine form" [...] {{in her role as}} a TGS producer. Rabin gave the episode an A- grade rating. Bob Sassone of TV Squad deemed this episode a [...] "solid season-opener" [...] that featured [...] "lots of great lines and plot development". Meredith Blake, a contributor from the Los Angeles Times, was thrilled that the Jack and Avery relationship [...] "not only lasted the summer, but is thriving", and wrote that she was looking forward to the pregnancy storyline involving Avery. Blake noted that Damon's character was [...] "darn-near perfect, by which I mean 'a male version of Liz.'" [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for HitFix said that [...] "The Fabian Strategy" [...] did not [...] "live up to the good old days" [...] of past episodes, nonetheless {{reported that}} he [...] "laughed enough" [...] and was pleased with the direction the show took Liz and Carol's relationship. Sepinwall did not like Tracy and Kenneth's story, calling it a complete miss, but was appreciative of the other storylines, choosing Pete and Jenna's as his favorite. Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times was positive about Damon's role on the show, noting that he has been a [...] "hoot". Scott Eidler of The Cornell Daily Sun commented that the episode was a [...] "nice start to the [...] season" [...] of 30 Rock as it was [...] "perhaps more plot-driven than packed with the emotional and uproariously funny episodes that concluded last season." [...] Eidler commented that [...] "The Fabian Strategy" [...] never did [...] " [...] the utter hilariousness of last season, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> that wasn't the climax... and it can eventually return to its previous heights of hilarity". TV Guides Bruce Fretts was complimentary towards Damon's role as Tina Fey's love interest, writing that Damon [...] "showed a refreshingly silly side in keeping with 30 Rocks anything-goes spirit." [...] Matt Wilstein of The Huffington Post called the premiere [...] "a very solid first episode", enjoying Damon's part on the show and the Kenneth story of him still being fired by NBC.|$|E
