40|$|A <b>bioreactor</b> <b>apparatus</b> is {{described}} for studying bacterial attachment. A cyclic, on-off, flow regime was imposed within the apparatus. Model calculations illustrate {{the utility of}} this flow pattern in the selection and maintenance of slow-growing, adherent organisms. The apparatus {{is believed to have}} general utility in testing bacterial attachment influenced by many types of experimental or environmental constraints, including variations in fluid dynamics, presence of toxic substances (metals or organics), nature of the substratum surface, concentrations of limiting nutrients, and competition between bacterial strains. As an example application, the apparatus was employed to test 14 bacterial strains for surface attachment in a nutrient-limited growth medium. The medium was developed, using the chemical equilibrium program MINEQL, for planned studies of biofilms in a solution with a chemically defined composition that permits calculation of trace metal speciation. The apparatus was used to select organisms with growth and attachment characteristics that could not be evaluated by conventional batch, or chemostat, culture conditions. When supplied with acetate, pyruvate, or succinate as a carbon and energy source, the gram-negative strains Pseudomonas cepacia 17616 and Zoogloea sp. WGO 4 showed superior attachment characteristics to glass surfaces in the chemically defined medium but only moderate fluid-phase growth. The gram-positive Arthrobacter sp. strain 9 G 4 D and gram-negative species P. pickettii and Zoogloea sp. WNJ 8, when supplied with pyruvate as a carbon and energy source, were capable of superior growth in the fluid phase but formed only a low to moderate biofilm surface coverage...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the effects of {{hydrodynamic}} turbulent shear stress on the biological responses of carrot cell cultures (Daucus carota) has been performed over a range of turbulent shear stresses. The experimental apparatus mimics turbulent conditions similar to the impeller region of a conventional stirred tank <b>bioreactor.</b> The <b>apparatus</b> was designed with the aid of simulations made using the computational fluid dynamics package CFX 4. It consists of two concentric cylinders and a rotating cylindrical rod to provide turbulent mixing. The model was based on the two dimensional structure of a cylindrical wake in an annulus. The empirical shear stress agreed well with simulated values. Cell damage was found to correlate well with both the bulk energy dissipation and ‘local’ energy dissipation rate. The initial results suggest that significant cell damage occurs when the maximum energy dissipation is 50 Wkg⁻¹ and the total energy dissipation is 10 ⁴ Jkg⁻¹. These values are slightly higher than those reported earlier¹⁻²...|$|R
40|$|Based on Johnson Space Flight Center's {{development}} of a rotating <b>bioreactor</b> cell culture <b>apparatus</b> for Space Shuttle medical research, Johnson Space Flight Center engineers {{who worked on the}} original project formed a company called Synthecon, with the intention of commercializing the bioreactor technology. Synthecon grows three dimensional tissues in the bioreactor. These are superior to previous two-dimensional tissue samples in the study of human cell growth. A refined version of the Johnson Space Center technology, Synthecon's Rotary Cell Culture System includes a cell culture chamber that rotates around a horizontal axis. The cells establish an orbit that approximates free fall through the liquid medium in the chamber. The technology has significant applications for cancer research and treatment as well as AIDS research...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND All known organisms {{develop and}} evolve in the {{presence}} of gravitational force, and it is evident that gravity has a significant influence on organism physiology and development. Microgravity is known to affect gene expression, enzyme activity, cytoskeleton organization, mitotic proliferation and intracellular signaling. OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of the present study was}} to study some aspects of the development in vitro of mouse embryonic testes in simulated microgravity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Testes from mouse embryos (12. 5 - 16. 5 days post coitum, d. p. c.) were cultured in simulated microgravity and standard static culture conditions. The microgravity condition was provided by a Rotary Cell Culture System (RWV) <b>bioreactor,</b> an <b>apparatus</b> designated for 3 D tissue and small organ cultures. After 48 h of the culture in the RWV, testis morphology and size was evaluated. RESULTS: The first observation was that the culture in the RWV bioreactor had a beneficial effect on the testis growth and on the survival of germ cells in comparison to static 2 D culture methods. Moreover, we found, that RWV culture caused disorganization the gonadal tissues, namely of the testis cords. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the maintenance of testis cord could be sensitive to microgravity. We hypothesize that while the effect on testis growth is due to a better nutrient and oxygen supply, the testis cord's disorganization might depend on the microgravity conditions simulated by the bioreactor. Considering the complexity of the processes involved in the formation of the testis cords and their dynamic changes during the embryo fetal period, further studies are needed to identify the causes of such effect...|$|R
