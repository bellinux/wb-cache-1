5|$|Even as {{the growth}} of the {{technology}} sector transformed the region's economy, progressive politics continued to guide the region's political environment. By the turn of the millennium, Non-Hispanic whites, the largest ethnic group in the United States, were only half of the population in the <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> as immigration among minority groups accelerated. During this time, the <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> {{was the center of the}} LGBT rights movement: in 2004, San Francisco began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, a first in the United States, and four years later, a majority of voters in the <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> rejected California Proposition 8, which sought to constitutionally restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples but ultimately passed statewide. The <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> was also the center of contentious protests concerning racial and economic inequality. In 2009, an African American man named Oscar Grant was fatally shot by <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> Rapid Transit police officers, precipitating widespread protests across the region and even riots in Oakland, and whose name was symbolically tied to the Occupy Oakland protests two years later that sought to fight against social and economic inequality. Following the Inauguration of Donald Trump as President of the United States in 2017, the <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> became a center of resistance to his administration, beginning with widespread protests in concert with the nationwide Women's March a day later, followed by frequent public feuds between Trump and various <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> political, cultural, and business figures over issues of race and immigration, among others.|$|E

These agencies include the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board, <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> Air Quality Management District, the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and the Association of <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> Governments, the latter two of which partner to deliver a <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> Census using the nine-county definition.|$|E

After being ceded to the United States in 1848, the <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> grew immensely due to the California Gold Rush, establishing itself {{as one of the}} most important regions on the West Coast. Today, the <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> is the home of Silicon Valley, Wine Country, and numerous companies, universities, bridges, airports, and parks.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{archaeological evidence}} of human {{settlements in the}} <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> dates back to 3000 BC. In 1769, the <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> was inhabited by the Ohlone people when a Spanish exploration party led by Gaspar de Portolà entered the Bay – the first documented European visit to the <b>Bay</b> <b>Area.</b> After Mexico established independence from Spain in 1821, the region was briefly controlled by the Mexican government until the United States seized the territory in 1846 during the Mexican–American War. Soon after, discovery of gold in California attracted a flood of treasure seekers, many using ports in the <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> as an entry point. During {{the early years of}} California's statehood, state legislative business rotated between three locations in the <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> before a permanent state capital was established in Sacramento. A major earthquake leveled the city of San Francisco and environs in 1906, but the region quickly rebuilt in time to host the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition. During World War II, the <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> {{played a major role in}} America's war effort in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater, with San Francisco's Fort Mason acting as a primary embarkation point for American forces. In 1945, the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco, establishing the United Nations, and in 1951, the Treaty of San Francisco officially ended the U.S.'s war with Japan. Since then, the <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> has experienced numerous political, cultural and artistic movements, developing unique local genres in music and art and establishing itself as a hotbed of progressive politics. Economically, the post-war <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> saw huge growth in the financial and technology industries, creating a vibrant and diverse economy with a gross domestic product of over $700 billion, and home to the second highest concentration of Fortune 500 companies in the United States.|$|E

5|$|During {{the later}} 20th century and afterward, {{many of the}} {{communities}} and businesses in the area began cooperative efforts, including the Clear Lake Area Chamber of Commerce, the <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> Houston Economic Partnership, and the <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> Houston Transportation Partnership, to create a distinct economic and civic identity for the region and to plan regional development. Though most of the communities {{in the region have}} been incorporated into municipalities, a few unincorporated communities remain under the extra-territorial jurisdiction of neighboring towns. These include San Leon, Bacliff, and Smith Point. The communities of San Leon and Bacliff, despite their seaside location, their proximity to the relatively prosperous Clear Lake Area, and the development of summer resort communities there in the early 20th century, have suffered economic decline since the mid-20th century and are among the least affluent parts of the <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> today.|$|E

5|$|Politics in the <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the most liberal in California and in the United States.
