50|$|A {{classic example}} of {{biochemical}} evidence for evolution is the variance of the ubiquitous (i.e. all living organisms have it, because it performs very basic life functions) protein Cytochrome c in living cells. The variance of cytochrome c of different organisms is measured {{in the number of}} differing amino acids, each differing amino acid being a result of a <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> <b>substitution,</b> a mutation. If each differing amino acid is assumed the result of one <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> <b>substitution,</b> it can be calculated how long ago the two species diverged by multiplying the number of base pair substitutions by the estimated time it takes for a substituted base pair of the cytochrome c gene to be successfully passed on. For example, if the average time it takes for a base pair of the cytochrome c gene to mutate is N years, the number of amino acids making up the cytochrome c protein in monkeys differ by one from that of humans, this leads {{to the conclusion that the}} two species diverged N years ago.|$|E

50|$|The T315I is {{a unique}} {{mutation}} because of its resistance to all approved Bcr-Abl inhibitors, prior to ponatinib. It {{is caused by a}} single cytosine to thymine (C -> T) <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> <b>substitution</b> at position 944 of the Abl gene (codon '315' of the Abl protein) sequence resulting in amino acid (T)hreonine being substituted by (I)soleucine at that position - thus 'T315I'. This substitution eliminates a critical oxygen molecule needed for hydrogen bonding between imatinib and the Abl kinase, and also creates steric hindrance to the binding of most TKIs.When discovered, it was estimated that every 6 out of 9 cases of advanced stage CML with imatinib resistance carried this mutation. T315I produces the highest magnitude of resistance of any mutation both to imatinib and second generations TKIs. Ponatinib (Iclusig) by Ariad was approved in 2013 for use as second-line CML treatment, and is the only licensed TKI which binds to the T315I mutated kinase successfully.|$|E

We used computational protein design to alter the cleavage specificity of I-MsoI for three contiguous <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> <b>substitutions,</b> resulting in an endonuclease whose activity and specificity for its new site rival that of wild-type I-MsoI for the original site. Concerted design for all simultaneous substitutions was more successful than a modular approach against individual substitutions, highlighting the importance of context-dependent redesign and optimization of protein–DNA interactions. We then used computational design based on the crystal structure of the designed complex, which revealed significant unanticipated shifts in DNA conformation, to create an endonuclease that specifically cleaves a site with four contiguous <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> <b>substitutions.</b> Our results demonstrate that specificity switches for multiple concerted <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> <b>substitutions</b> can be computationally designed, and that iteration between design and structure determination provides a route to large scale reprogramming of specificity...|$|R

5000|$|Until the {{commercial}} development of mobile DNA technology in 2007 and zinc-finger nuclease technology in 2009, {{there were only}} two technologies {{that could be used to}} produce rat models of human disease: cloning and chemical mutagenesis using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). Although cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) could theoretically be used to create rats with specific mutations by mutating somatic cells, and then using these cells for SCNT, this approach has not been used successfully to create knockout rats. One problem with this strategy is that SCNT is extremely inefficient. The first published attempt had a success rate of less than 1%. Alternatively, ENU mutagenesis is a common random mutagenesis gene knockout strategy in the mouse that can also be used in the rat. ENU mutagenesis involves using a chemical, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), to create single base changes in the genome. ENU transfers its ethyl group to oxygen or nitrogen radicals in DNA, resulting in mis-pairing and <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> <b>substitution.</b> Mutant animals can be produced by injecting a male mouse with ENU, and breeding with a wild type female to produce mutant offspring. ENU mutagenesis creates a high frequency of random mutations, with approximately one base pair change in any given gene in every 200-700 gametes. Despite its high mutagenicity, the physical penetration of ENU is limited and only about 500 genes are mutated for each male and a very small number of the total mutations have an observable phenotype. Thousands of mutations typically need to be created in a single animal in order to generate one novel phenotype.|$|E

All of the deletions removed a Hha I site at {{the border between the}} alpha-specific sequences (Y alpha) and the adjacent Z region. We also examined several spontaneous inc mutations that prevent MAT switching. Two of these mutations were cloned in recombinant DNA plasmids and their sequences were determined.

40|$|Instability of {{repetitive}} sequences is {{a hallmark}} of human cancer, and its enhancement {{has been linked to}} oxidative stress. Malondialdehyde is an endogenous product of oxidative stress that reacts with guanine to form the exocyclic adduct, pyrimido[1, 2 - α]purin- 10 (3 H) -one (M 1 G). We used site-specifically modified single- and double-stranded vectors to investigate the mutagenic potential of M 1 G in bacteria and mammalian cells. M 1 G induced frameshift mutations (- 1 and - 2) when positioned in a reiterated (CpG) 4 sequence but not when positioned in a nonreiterated sequence in Escherichia coli and in COS- 7 cells. The frequency of frameshift mutations was highest when M 1 G was placed at the third G in the sequence. M 1 G induced <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> <b>substitutions</b> at comparable frequencies in both sequence contexts in COS- 7 cells.

We studied the specificity and rate of different mutational biases in real time in the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium under conditions of strongly reduced selection {{and in the absence}} of the major DNA repair systems involved in repairing common spontaneous mutations caused by oxidized and deaminated DNA bases. The mutational spectrum was determined by whole-genome sequencing of two S. typhimurium mutants that were serially passaged for 5, 000 generations. Analysis of 943 identified <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> <b>substitutions</b> showed that 91 % were GC-to-TA transversions and 7 % were GC-to-AT transitions, commonly associated with 8 -oxoG- and deamination-induced damages, respectively.

With regard to mutational biases, there was a significant increase in C-to-T transitions on the nontranscribed strand, and for highly expressed genes, C/G-to-T mutations were more common than expected; however, no significant mutational bias with regard to leading and lagging strands of replication or chromosome position were found. These results suggest that, based on the experimentally determined mutational rates and specificities, a bacterial genome lacking the relevant DNA repair systems could, as a consequence of these underlying mutational biases, very rapidly reduce its GC content...|$|R

Balanced rearrangements of 6 q are less common but occur in leukaemias of both lymphoid and myeloid origin. With the aim of identifying genes that contribute to leukaemia through loss or rearrangement the breakpoints of translocations and deletions of 6 q were mapped by FISH. Comparison between the mapped deletions led to the identification of a 4. 8 Mb CDR and candidate tumour suppressor gene (GluR- 6). Expression of GluR- 6 was demonstrated to occur in haernatologic tissues and mutation analysis was performed on leukaemic samples with clonal deletions of the region.

In seven cases breakpoints clustered within a 14 Mb region of 6 q 22 -q 23 but different subregions were defined for five analysed in detail.
