[...] But several critics have praised the film. Upon its initial release on videotape, Tim Lucas in The Video Watchdog Book said, [...] "The movie is terrific, much more exciting than most contemporary horror video releases..." [...] Kim Newman, in The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural, noted that Inferno was [...] "a dazzling series of set pieces designed to give the impression that the real world is terrifying, beautiful, erotic and dangerous Inferno is a masterpiece of absolute film, and perhaps the most underrated horror movie of the 1980s." [...] In 2013, Time Out compiled a list of the 100 greatest horror films ever made based on the top ten lists of over one hundred film directors, screenwriters, and critics, and Inferno was listed as #92; in the resulting critical commentary for the film, Nigel Floyd wrote, [...] "Horror cinema at its most baroque: a simple libretto is embroidered with elaborate, flowing camera movements, abstract blocks of colour, unsettling sound effects and soundtrack composer Keith Emerson’s thunderous rock variations on Verdi...Argento’s best work is far behind him, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>alone</b> justifies his cult reputation." ...|$|E

Six breeds of robotic bug-like drones designed to [...] "cleanse" [...] Mata Nui to its former barren state. The Bohrok rampage across the island and tear down the regions of each village, forcing the Turaga and Matoran to flee. While many of the villagers are placed {{under the influence of the}} Bohrok's brain-like Krana organisms, others find new ways to retaliate against the swarms. The Toa collect all eight varieties of Krana from each breed while combating the swarms and later reunite to travel down to the Bohrok's underground nests. There, they place the Krana in niches located in each breed's hive, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>alone</b> fails to stop the swarms. The Toa then discover powerful, sentient battle armor named Exo-Toa. Donning them, they're directed to the chamber of the true Bohrok commanders: the Bahrag twins Cahdok and Gahdok. As the Toa battle the nest queens, they discover that the Exo-Toa are hampering their elemental abilities. Taking the robotic armor off, they are able to re-access them and trap the Bahrag in a cage of solid protodermis (a material created by all six Toa's elemental powers). On the surface, the swarms stop in mid-action. The Matoran begin the process of rebuilding their villages with help from the Bohrok robots now that their Krana are powerless. The Toa's victory is short-lived when the ground beneath them opens up and plunges each of them into tubes filled with energized protodermis, transforming the heroes into more powerful beings with new armor, masks and weapons; creating the Toa Nuva. At the same time, a set of new Kanohi masks are placed in secret hiding places all over Mata Nui for the heroes to find, six symbol plaques connected to the Toa's elemental abilities appear in each village, and a cube that can fit all the plaques together is formed near the Bahrag's prison. Emerging from the tubes and returning to the surface, the Toa Nuva engage in battle against one another to test their new powers, but their actions lead to anger amongst them and despite Gali's pleas, all think it best to go their separate ways.|$|E

6000|$|But {{when two}} brethren {{were coming to}} him, and water failed them on the journey, one of them died, {{and the other was}} about to die. In fact, being no longer able to walk, he too lay upon the ground expecting death.

For this has been showed to me as I prayed." [...] So the monks going found the one lying dead, and buried him; and the other they recovered with the water, and brought him to the old man. Now the distance was a day's journey. But if any one should ask why he did not speak before one of them expired, he does not question rightly; for the judgment of that death did not belong to Antony, but to God, who both judged concerning the one; and revealed concerning the other. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>alone</b> in Antony was wonderful, that sitting on the mountain he kept his heart watchful, and the Lord showed him things afar off.|$|E
60|$|Divergence of Character.--The principle, which I have {{designated}} by this term, is of high importance on my theory, and explains, as I believe, several important facts. In the first place, varieties, even strongly-marked ones, though having somewhat {{of the character}} of species--as is shown by the hopeless doubts in many cases how to rank them--yet certainly differ from each other far less than do good and distinct species. Nevertheless, according to my view, varieties are species in the process of formation, or are, as I have called them, incipient species. How, then, does the lesser difference between varieties become augmented into the greater difference between species? That this does habitually happen, we must infer from most of the innumerable species throughout nature presenting well-marked differences; whereas varieties, the supposed prototypes and parents of future well-marked species, present slight and ill-defined differences. Mere chance, as we may call it, might cause one variety to differ in some character from its parents, and the offspring of this variety again to differ from its parent in the very same character and in a greater degree; <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>alone</b> would never account for so habitual and large an amount of difference as that between varieties of the same species and species of the same genus.|$|E
