5|$|Once filming on {{the movie}} was completed, Berg began to explore {{adapting}} the story for television. Berg later said he had regretted having to jettison many of the interpersonal topics from the book <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> constraints of a feature film. Creating a TV series, particularly one based on fictional characters, allowed him to address many of those elements in-depth.|$|E
5|$|If a {{laser beam}} is swept quickly across a distant object, the spot of light can move faster thanc, {{although}} the initial movement of the spot is delayed <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> it takes light {{to get to the}} distant object at the speedc. However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speedc from the laser to the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move faster thanc, after a delay in time. In neither case does any matter, energy, or information travel faster than light.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{state that}} Deusdedit {{died of the}} plague that was {{prevalent}} in England at the time. Because Bede records the death of Deusdedit shortly after he mentions {{the outbreak of the}} plague, the historian J. R. Maddicott asserts that both Deusdedit and Eorcenberht were struck suddenly with the disease and died quickly. Bede is not specific on the type of plague, but Maddicott argues that <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of its eruption and the way it arrived in England it was probably bubonic plague. Although Bede does not describe either Eorcenberht or Deusdedit's symptoms he does discuss another victim of the 664 disease, who suffered from a tumour on his thigh, resembling the characteristic groin swellings of bubonic plague.|$|E

5|$|The CAB Rating for {{the show}} was 22.1% and placed 12th among the highest rated evening {{programs}} of the 1932–33 season. The CAB Rating was not disappointing – popular established shows such as The Shadow and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes did not perform as well – but {{it was less than}} half of Texaco's Fire Chief, which got a 44.8% CAB Rating and was the third highest-rated program of the season. One reason for the lower ratings may be <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> slot the show aired. In September 1932, only 40% of radio owners were listening to the radio at 7:00p.m., whereas 60% listened at 9:00p.m. The 1932–1933 season's top-rated shows, The Chase and Sanborn Hour, Jack Pearl's Baron Münchhausen, and Fire Chief all aired after 9:00p.m. Standard Oil decided it could not compete with Texaco in the ratings and Five-Star Theater was not renewed for a second season.|$|E

However, according to the BMRCL, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> taken by the Indian Railways to approve works at Swastik Station and Malleswaram 66-metre metro viaduct, the Green Line was expected to open only in April–May 2013.

25|$|The {{aldosterone}} {{production is}} also affected to one extent or another by nervous control, which integrates the inverse of carotid artery pressure, pain, posture, and probably emotion (anxiety, fear, and hostility) (including surgical stress).

Thus, there is an advantage to an animal's anticipating a future need from interaction with a predator, since too high a serum content of potassium has very adverse effects on nervous transmission.|$|E

However, the bullet that had wounded him at Gettysburg had lodged close to a major artery {{and could not be}} removed without risking his life, so he suffered groin pain for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> his life. Nonetheless, he tried to attract northern capital to rebuild the devastated local economy. He and former classmate and Confederate general John D.

25|$|Gautier did not {{consider}} himself to be dramatist but more of a poet and storyteller. His plays were limited <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in which he lived; during the Revolution of 1848, many theaters were closed down and therefore plays were scarce. Most of the plays that dominated the mid-century were written by playwrights who insisted on conformity and conventional formulas and catered to cautious middle-class audiences. As a result, most of Gautier's plays were never published or reluctantly accepted.|$|E
25|$|In April 2008, Edmonton City Council {{approved}} $45 {{million in}} funding {{to build a}} tunnel under the Epcor Tower site immediately, {{while it was still}} under construction, with the aim of saving $140 million more than would have been required to dig under the tower once it was completed. This step was taken even though the rest of the project had not yet been approved, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> constraint posed by the construction of the new tower. Construction on the tunnel began in August 2009 and was completed by approximately September 2010.|$|E

Also, the Patriots received eight total roster exemptions for the NFL Europe allocations of Earl Charles, Todd Mortensen, Rich Musinski, Zuriel Smith, Antwain Spann, Nick Steitz, and Ray Ventrone (one for each player, plus one bonus exemption <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> Ventrone spent on a practice squad in 2006).|$|E

25|$|Different {{pieces of}} wood cut from a large tree may differ decidedly, {{particularly}} if the tree is big and mature.

2500|$|In <b>the</b> Bonciu chapter <b>of</b> his own {{companion}} to Romanian literature (published 2008), Nicolae Manolescu suggested that <b>the</b> author <b>of</b> Bagaj... was more gifted than consecrated novelists such as Gib Mihăescu.

During a far-reaching literary debate of late 2008, Cernat has also criticized those postmodern authors who, in his view, overrate H. Bonciu and Constantin Fântâneru to <b>the</b> detriment <b>of</b> interwar classics. Such conclusions were mirrored by other authors.
