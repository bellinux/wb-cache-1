5|$|After small planetesimals—about 1km in diameter—have {{formed by}} {{one way or}} another, runaway {{accretion}} begins. It is called runaway because the mass growth rate is proportional to , where R and M are the radius and mass of the growing body, respectively. It {{is obvious that the}} specific (divided by mass) growth accelerates as the mass increases. This leads to the preferential growth of larger <b>bodies</b> at the expense of smaller ones. The runaway accretion lasts between 10,000 and 100,000years and ends when the largest <b>bodies</b> exceed approximately 1,000km in diameter. Slowing of the accretion is caused by gravitational perturbations by large <b>bodies</b> on the remaining planetesimals.

In an online survey, 1287 Dutch women answered questions concerning dispositional mindfulness, <b>body</b> comparison, and <b>body</b> satisfaction. Results showed that <b>body</b> comparison was related negatively to both dispositional mindfulness and <b>body</b> satisfaction, whereas the two latter variables were related positively. <b>Body</b> comparison partially mediated the relation between mindfulness and <b>body</b> satisfaction.
