Bintang Plaza and Boulevard Shopping Mall are the two major shopping destinations for Brunei people. As of 2014, Miri visitor movement along Kuala Baram-Kuala Belait checkpoint (Sungai Tujoh, along the Sarawak-Brunei border) reached a total of 2.9 million people in one year. Miri is also an eco-tourism gateway to four national parks and a marine national park.|$|E

This is different from most central banks, which use interest rates to manage policy.|$|E

2500|$|In general, {{bilateral}} {{relations with other}} ASEAN members are strong; however, disagreements have arisen, and relations with neighbouring Malaysia and Indonesia have sometimes been strained. Malaysia and Singapore have clashed over the delivery of fresh water to Singapore, and access by the Singapore Armed Forces to Malaysian airspace. Border issues exist with Malaysia and Indonesia, and both have banned the sale of marine sand to Singapore over disputes about Singapore's land reclamation. [...] Some previous disputes, such as the Pedra Branca dispute, have been resolved by the International Court of Justice. [...] Piracy in the Strait of Malacca has been a cause of concern for all three countries.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the 1997 and 1998 haze-related air {{pollution}} episodes on the tourism industry in Brunei Darussalam has been analysed using multiple regression analysis and monthly arrival data of tourists from January 1995 to September 1999, a sample of 57 monthly observations. The analysis is first undertaken using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Count data models based on Poisson regression are then used to estimate the {{impact of the}} haze-related air pollution. Conservative estimates of impact of the haze-related air pollution using OLS regression are a reduction of 3. 75 per cent in the number if tourists and direct economic loss to the tourism industry of about one million <b>Brunei</b> <b>dollars</b> (B$). Using the Poisson regression analysis, monthly arrivals are estimated to be reduced by about 28. 7 per cent resulting in total direct loss of about B$ 8 million. ...|$|R

50|$|In the Philippines, {{there is}} one {{shopping}} mall called the Duty Free Philippines Fiestamall, which is located {{a few miles away}} from Ninoy Aquino Airport as opposed to being at the airport itself. It is the only shopping mall {{of its kind in the}} world. The goods that are sold in this mall are often imported products which come from around the world (mainly from United States, Asia and Australasia) and are not found in any other shopping malls in the country, aside from duty-free malls. Tourists, visitors and returning citizens of Philippines often pay a visit to this mall shortly after their arrival (since only arriving passengers and their companions are allowed access). In order to gain entry, a passport is needed to be presented and registered at the Customer Registration Counter at the entrance of the mall. The customer will then be issued a shopping card; these shopping cards must be presented to the cashier for validation of purchases. Arriving customers are given a certain tax-free allowance on purchases and anything in excess will be subject to local and national taxes. In the past, the mall used to only accept US dollars and Philippine peso but in recent years, it had begun accepting other currencies such as Japanese yen, <b>Brunei</b> <b>dollar,</b> Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Saudi riyal, Bahraini dinar, and Thai baht. Currency exchange booths are also available inside the mall if a customer wishes to exchange currencies into Philippine pesos or US dollars. Credits cards can also be used for purchasing goods.In Australia, duty-free shops, once common, have all but disappeared since the introduction of GST in 2000. Retailer James Richardson operates several duty-free shops in major cities, but most duty-free shops are now located within international airports. Residents and tourists are allowed to purchase virtually any physical good within 60 days of departure, which needs to be taken on the outward flight, and claim the GST component back through the Tourist Refund Scheme when passing through customs. Consumers are now free to fully use their items prior to departure. This is in contrast prior to 2000, where all purchases had to be packed by the duty-free store in a sealed clear plastic bag, and could only be broken open by customs staff just prior to departure.|$|E
