The design of <b>bogie</b> <b>bolster</b> wagons had developed from earlier timber wagons: these were short four-wheeled wagons, each carrying a single swivelling bolster. A pair of such wagons could carry a large treetrunk to a sawmill, but they required either the tree to take the full tension of the train or for a suitable number of match wagons to be marshalled between the two bolster wagons.

5000|$|The Engineers Department {{had many}} {{different}} wagons for their specialised needs {{such as the}} ballast wagons which were all given diagram numbers in the P series. Most of these were small iron open wagons varying from 8 to 20 tons capacity, but some had specialised discharge systems - P6, P7 and P22 were hoppers, {{and a number of}} side-tipping wagons were also bought in 1930 but never allocated a diagram number. [...] Rail wagons ('') were mixed in with revenue earning <b>bogie</b> <b>bolsters</b> in the J diagrams, but open wagons for new sleepers had their own T diagram series, which also included special well wagons to carry sleepers with their rail chairs fixed to them (T1, T12 and T13).The operating department had a requirement for wagons to carry gas for carriage lighting. These were given the telegraphic code 'Cordon' and came in two distinct styles, with two long tanks {{along the length of the}} wagon (diagram DD5) or nine short tanks stacked across the wagon (DD4). [...] There were also match or 'shunting' trucks to connect broad and standard gauge wagons until the broad gauge was abandoned in 1892, or to run with overhanging or dangerous loads. [...] These were originally just ordinary flat trucks run without a load, but in later years a number of old wagons were kept for this purpose and given diagrams L21 to L23. Cranes also had match trucks of various styles in diagrams L1 to L20. [...] Shunters trucks were another kind of flat wagon and could be found in diagrams M1 to M5. These had full length footboards and handrails for shunters who rode on them during movements around stations and depots; they carried a distinctive asymmetrical toolbox and usually had their depot name painted on this.|$|R
5000|$|A bogie ( [...] ) is a wheeled wagon or trolley. In {{mechanics}} terms, a bogie is {{a chassis}} or framework carrying wheels, {{attached to a}} vehicle. It can be fixed in place, as on a cargo truck, mounted on a swivel, as on a railway carriage or locomotive, or sprung as in the suspension of a caterpillar tracked vehicle. Usually, two bogies are fitted to each carriage, wagon or locomotive, one at each end. An alternate configuration often is used in articulated vehicles, which places the bogies (often jacobs bogies) under {{the connection between the}} carriages or wagons. Most bogies have two axles, as this is the simplest design, but some cars designed for extremely heavy loads have been built with up to five axles per bogie. Heavy-duty cars may have more than two <b>bogies</b> using span <b>bolsters</b> to equalize the load and connect the bogies to the cars. Usually, the train floor is at a level above the bogies, but the floor of the car may be lower between bogies, such as for a double decker train to increase interior space while staying within height restrictions, or in easy-access, stepless-entry, low-floor trains.|$|R
50|$|The bolster springs are {{supported}} on a lower spring beam. The lower spring beam is a fabricated structure {{made of steel}} plates. It is trapezoidal in shape with small steel tubes on each end. The location of the bolster spring seating is marked by two circular grooves in the center. A rubber washer is placed at the grooved section. The bolster spring sits on the rubber washer. The lower spring beam is also a free-floating structure. It is not bolted or welded either to the bogie frame or the <b>bogie</b> <b>bolster.</b> It {{is attached to the}} bogie frame on the outside {{with the help of a}} steel hanger. They are traditionally called the BSS Hangers (Bogie Secondary Suspension Hangers). A BSS pin is placed in the tubular section in the end portion of the lower spring beam. A hanger block is placed below the BSS pin. The BSS hanger in turn supports the hanger. This arrangement is done on all the four corners of the lower spring beam. The top end of the hanger also has a similar arrangement. However, instead of the BSS pin, steel brackets are welded on the lower side of the bogie frame of which the BSS hanger hangs with the help of hanger block. This arrangement is same for all the four top corners of the hangers. Hence, the lower spring beam also become a floating member hinged to the bogie frame with the help of hangers on the top and the bottom. This allows for the longitudinal movement of the lower spring beam.|$|E

50|$|The fixed bogies {{which are}} used by most 100% low floor trams {{increase}} track wear and decrease {{the speed at which}} a tram can drive through a curve (usually 4 - 15 km/h in 20 m radius curve). The 15 T is designed to cope with these issues through Jacobs bogies under the articulations and pivoting bogies at the tram's ends. For a time it was said to be the only true 100% low floor tram with pivoting bogies in production. However, the Alstom Citadis X04, an experimental 100% low floor tram currently being developed with pivoting bogies (but with sections of high floor seating over the bogies), has made an initial production appearance as a modified Citadis 301 (with a fixed centre bogie) in Istanbul, and for Helsinki, a tram with similar interior solution and all pivoting bogies is undergoing trials as of 2015. With the same length of tramcar, the Škoda 15 T has also four bogies compared to the predecessor Škoda 14 T's three (same on most other 100% low floor trams) (fixed) bogies, which decreases the load each wheel puts on the track. The most of the tram floor is at height of 350 mm above rail; the height over the bogies is 450 mm above rail; the transition is inclined, without interior steps. The corridor above the central bogies is 700 mm wide. The bogies may be all driven, or some of them may be idle ones, depending on the customer's preferences. The bogies have two axles and two-level springing. The mounted wheels are made of rubber-sprung wheels with integrated brake-discs and axle bearing. On the axle bearings there is a combined, dynamically resistant, primary rubber-bonded-metal-sprung bogie framework. This bogie framework supports four traction motors and one (in outer bogies) or two (in inner <b>bogies)</b> sprung swing <b>bolsters.</b> The secondary springing of the swing bolsters is secured by steel coil springs with parallel hydraulic rotating dampers. On the swing bolsters there are pivot bearings, which facilitate full rotation of the bogie below the body without any limitations.|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Raylı taşıt dinamiği demiryolu mühendisliğinin temel konularından biridir. Farklı fiziksel koşullar altında aracın davranışı yapılan dinamik analizler sonucu belirlenir. Aracın dinamiğini etkileyen temel parametreler taşıtın boyutları, kütle ve atalet değerleridir. Ayrıca süspansiyon elemanlarının yay ve sönüm katsayıları ve bu elemanların bağlantı noktalarının konumları da taşıt dinamiğini etkilmektedit. Taşıtın davranışını belirleyen bir diğer önemli parametre ise tekerlek ve ray profilidir. Tekerlek profilinin yuvarlanma düzlemi aracın düz yoldaki davranışını, flanş bölgesi ise kurptaki davranışını belirlemektedir. Metro ve hafif metro sistemlerinde tekerlek profili standartlar tarafından belirlenirken tramvay hatlarında ise işletmeci tarafından hat karakteristikleri ve işletme hızı gibi parametreler göz önünde bulundurularak belirlenmektedir. Tekerlek profili tasarımında dikkat edilmesi gereken ana husus konfor-güvenlik ilişkisinin doğru bir şekilde kurulmasıdır. Bu tez kapsamında raylı taşıt dinamiğinde önemli bir etkiye sahip olan tekerlek-ray teması üzerinde durulmuştur. Öncelikle Simpack yazılımında bir tramvay aracına ait 52 serbestlik dereceli dinamik model oluşturulmuştur. Daha sonra üç farklı tekerlek profili (TTP 1, TTP 2 ve TTP 3) modele eklenerek performansları incelenmiş ve karşılaştırılmıştır. Yapılan kararlılık, konfor ve kurp analizleri sonucunda TTP 2 ve TTP 3 profilleri konfor, yanal kararlılık açısından daha iyi sonuçlar verdiği gözlemlenmiştir. Kurp analizinde ise her üç profilinde güvenlik sınırlarını aşmamakla birlikte TTP 1 profilinin deray oranı daha düşük çıkmıştır. Yapılan bu tez ile modellenen tramvay aracının dinamik sürüş performansı bakımından en uygun tekerlek profili belirlenmiştir. Önerilen tekerlek profili ile konfor iyileştirilirken güvenlik standartlar tarafından belirlenen sınırlar içerisinde tutulmuştur. Metro and trams {{are one of}} {{the most}} cost {{effective}} vehicles in urban transportation. This is due to the low energy loss of metal on metal contact between wheels and rail. The advantageous characteristics in passenger carrying capacity and punctual operation make them more preferable than other urban transportation vehicles. They also offer a secure and comfortable trip for passengers. Metro and trams differ from other railway vehicles in operating conditions. Some main differences are the distance between stations, passenger capacity, braking and acceleration. Especially tram vehicles’ design inputs vary considerably since they are operated within the motorway traffic and with respect to city’s weather condition and geological specification. The selection of railway wheel and rail profiles is a challenge that has faced engineers since the dawn of the railway age. This thesis is mainly focused on rail-wheel profile contact which has a very important effect on railway vehicle dynamics. Metro and light rail vehicle wheel profiles are determined with respect to the predefined standards. However in tramways, it is determined by the operator considering the parameters such as line characteristics and operating speeds. Increasing axle loads, the presence of tight curves and light vehicles causes more complexitty for wheel/rail interface. These differing requirements are all oriented toward same targets; increased durability and comfort, reduction of maintenance costs, and increased safety. First of all, the dynamic model is created in Simpack software. The dynamic behaviour of a railway vehicle can be analysed using three types of analysis: • linear analysis, for the evaluation of the vehicle model eigenvalues; • stability analysis, used for the evaluation of the critical speed of the vehicle; • dynamic analysis, to simulate the actual behaviour of the railway system in operating conditions. The complete vehicle–track system can be split up into three subsystems: vehicle, wheel–rail contact, and track. The first step in every vehicle computer simulation is to set up a mechanical model appropriate to fulfil the desired simulation task. The multibody system (MBS) approach is a powerful and widely used method for this procedure, especially if the vehicle’s running behaviour is to be analyzed. The typical model of a railway vehicle is composed of the three sub-assemblies: the car body, the front bogie, trailer bogie and the rear bogie. Each bogie consists of the <b>bogie</b> frame, <b>bolster,</b> and two wheelsets. In this research, the car body and bogie frames, as well as the wheelsets are treated as rigid bodies and are defined by their mass–inetria characteristics (mass, moments of inertia, and the position of the centre of gravity), and by the relative position of the bogies with respect to the car body itself. Each rigid body has six degrees of freedom; three translations and three rotations. All bodies are connected by linear and non-linear springs and dampers, representing the primary and secondary suspensions. Primary and secondary suspensions are often used to support the carbody components and to provide vibration isolation. The primary suspension is connected between the wheelset and the side frame, while the secondary suspension is connected between the bolster and the side frame. The primary and secondary suspensions consist of spring, damper, bump stop and trailer arm. Difference between contact areas is presented by creating contact models for these three wheel profiles. Mode frequencies and dampings are investigated by applying the modal analysis to investigate the stability of the system. Resonance characteristics of components such as carbody, <b>bogie</b> and <b>bolster</b> are observed with the aid of their mode shapes. Stability of the system indicated by investigating the damping values and root-loci figures for a speed range of 0 - 70 km/h. On the other hand, after the analysis of the most critical curve area under operating conditions, equivalent conicity did not exceed the limits. Lateral irregularity is applied to the straight track to see the lateral movement of the carbody during maximum velocity of 70 km/h. Lateral movement of the carbody is absorbed in time after the analysis and stability of the vehicle is proved for these conditions. Superiority of the TTP 2 and TTP 3 wheel profiles is shown by the lateral stability analysis results. Comfort index from EN 12299 standard is compared between three wheel profiles by using a track irregularity which is defined in ORE B 176 and also superiority of the TTP 2 and TTP 3 is investigated with respect to comfort for passengers. L/V ratio, creepages, creep forces and lateral forces are compared for each wheel profile by curve analysis for the most critical curve in the line. As a result, altough none of the wheel profiles exceed the safety limit, TTP 1 profile yields much safer results. On the other hand, TTP 2 and TTP 3 generates lower lateral forces during the curve than TTP 1 profile. Therefore, TTP 2 and TTP 3 profiles have superior characteristcs for maintenance costs and irregularites on wheel and rail profile. To sum up, TTP 1 profile is safer for curve analysis and TTP 2 and TTP 3 profiles have superior lateral stability and comfort characteristics and less lateral forces generated acting on the rail. Basic principle for wheel profile design process is building the relation between comfort and safety in a proper way. Comfort should be improved while safety limits should not be exceeded for designed wheel profile. With respect to these informations, optimization can be done on the wheel tread and flange area to get better results for safety and comfort. Additionally, profiles can be compared for wear conditions. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R

Methodology. In order {{to solve the problem}} complex of increasing TBO of freight car bogies the methods for the synthesis, analysis and systematic approach were used. In addition, the use of mathematical modeling unit, solid state physics, the theory of friction and wear of solids. Findings. The analysis of the technical condition of freight cars has shown that up to 15 % of the faults falls on the bogies. A separate element of the repaired <b>bogie</b> is a <b>bolster.</b> At this the center pad is recovered most often. The center pad wear is uneven and the technological methods used for the repair, do not allow providing uniform wear due to which there is a need in premature repairs. One of the ways to improve the center pad resource during repair is the application of welding or sputtering deposition, but with providing discrete strength and durability in the longitudinal and transverse directions of the car axis, respectively. In order to establish the boundaries of the distribution of renewable material along the center pad diameter it was considered the fatigue wear process in cooperation with center plate and described the geometry of the surface of the center pad wear.
