50|$|The wheels were of single-piece cast alloy, {{the front}} being {{equipped}} with sealed <b>ball</b> <b>races,</b> possibly {{a first for}} the industry.An alloy GB T91 Sprite caliper brake was employed at the front, while the rear brake was of the internal expanding type, integral with the three speed gear in the Sturmey Archer ‘AB’ hub. It appears as though the drive side flange of the hub was removed for fitting in the wheel.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{technical}} developments during this period appear to be down to Alec Plint, who is named as applicant on 5 Stuart Turner patents which include sealing crankcases, padding crankcases to improve compression, variable speed gears, and decompression devices. The 1911 patent diagrams show the current 2-stroke to be '2-port', i.e. with the inlet being by non-return valve into the transfer port, with <b>ball</b> <b>races</b> for the main bearings and deflector type piston. The inlet non-return valve {{is the subject of}} another Stuart Turner patent in 1911, naming Ernest Masters as co-applicant.|$|E

5000|$|A massive fore {{control tower}} was, {{for the first}} time, fitted with an {{internal}} lift and topped by three conductors (numbered n°1, 2, and A from top down), which were mounted on the same axis. The accumulation of heavy weight (85 tons) so {{high up in the}} top was felt to be noteworthy. When Dunkerque [...] was torpedoed at Mers-el-Kébir on 6 July 6, 1940 this proved to be a shortcoming, as the main fire control directors were unseated from their <b>ball</b> <b>races</b> because of the [...] "whiplash" [...] effect on the mast around which they were mounted.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{problem with}} the {{original}} engine series was that the compressor was fairly sensitive to disturbances in the intake airflow. To address this, the HeS 8 added a low-pressure impeller in the intake {{in front of the}} main compressor. The impeller did not add much to the compression, but by increasing pressure on the compressor face the airflow was greatly stabilized. The 14-blade impeller and 19-blade compressor were both made of milled aluminum. The 14-blade turbine was made of steel, and uncooled, which suggests turbine burnout would be common. The various components were connected together on a common tubular power shaft, supported by three <b>ball</b> <b>races.</b> The combustion chamber consisted of two diffusers that slowed the airflow from the compressor, and then injected fuel through 128 nozzles arranged in two sets at different [...] "depths". Various accessories, including the starter, were grouped around the intake and did not add to the overall diameter.|$|E
50|$|Most manual {{transmissions}} rely on {{splash lubrication}} although some five speed Rover gearboxes did incorporate an oil pump. The problem with splash lubrication {{is that it}} is speed dependent. There are centrifugal effects, hydrodynamic effects and effects from the gears working as pumps. If a gearbox is fitted with Perspex windows and run on a test rig these effects can be observed. As the gearbox is run through its rev range, the oil jets will switch over and move around. Research on the Austin Maxi 1500 gearbox showed that one of the <b>ball</b> <b>races</b> was running dry at 80 mph. The solution was to alter the casting to include a small projection that would intercept the main oil jet that was present at 80 mph and disperse it. This small modification enabled the later Maxi 1750 gearbox to be relatively trouble free. Four speed gearboxes seldom show these problems because at top speed (and maximum power) they are basically a solid shaft and the gears are not transmitting power.|$|E

50|$|These {{bearings}} {{make use}} of both ceramic <b>balls</b> and <b>race.</b> These bearings are impervious to corrosion and rarely require lubrication if at all. Due to the stiffness and hardness of the <b>balls</b> and <b>race</b> these bearings are noisy at high speeds. The stiffness of the ceramic makes these bearings brittle and liable to crack under load or impact. Because both <b>ball</b> and <b>race</b> are of similar hardness wear can lead to chipping at high speeds of both the <b>balls</b> and the <b>race</b> this can cause sparking.|$|R

The test bearing was operated at 85 rpm and 870 pounds axial load for 385 hr at 1000 deg F. Visual inspection of the test bearing showed a very marked increase in roughness of both the balls and the <b>ball</b> <b>races.</b> Details of the measurements and {{a photograph of the}} bearing parts after test are given.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{incorporated in}} the vertical sounding infrared radiometry experiments which were launched on Nimbus 5 in 1972 and on Nimbus 6 in 1975 are discussed. Both use dry lubricants. The Nimbus 5 radiometer includes a rotating chopper driven via a carbon fiber-acetal resin gearwheel. The driving motor runs at 2000 rpm and has completed over 7 x 10 to the 9 th power revolutions. Four gear driven filter wheels powered by stepper motors have each completed 2 x 10 to the 8 th power changes. The input calibration mirror mechanism and its field of view compensation mechanisms are also described. All 25 <b>ball</b> <b>races</b> used in the experiment are of the film transfer type. The Nimbus 6 radiometer includes two cells. Each contains a piston supported on diaphragm springs and driven electromagnetically. The pistons are 6 cm in diameter with a stroke of 1 cm and are driven at their mechanical resonant frequency of approx. 15 Hz. The calibrating mirrors rotate periodically to view a target. The support pivots are synthetic sapphire ring stones with separate end thrust stones. The problems of mounting these stones to withstand vibration loads is described...|$|E

50|$|A {{particularly}} common kind of {{rolling-element bearing}} is the ball bearing. The bearing has {{inner and outer}} <b>races</b> between which <b>balls</b> roll. Each <b>race</b> features a groove usually shaped so the ball fits slightly loose. Thus, in principle, the <b>ball</b> contacts each <b>race</b> across a very narrow area. However, a load on an infinitely small point would cause infinitely high contact pressure. In practice, the ball deforms (flattens) slightly where it contacts each race much as a tire flattens where it contacts the road. The race also yields slightly where each ball presses against it. Thus, the contact between <b>ball</b> and <b>race</b> is of finite size and has finite pressure. Note also that the deformed <b>ball</b> and <b>race</b> do not roll entirely smoothly because {{different parts of the}} ball are moving at different speeds as it rolls. Thus, there are opposing forces and sliding motions at each ball/race contact. Overall, these cause bearing drag.|$|R
40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to develop replacement bearings for the Rocketdyne Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) high pressure oxidizer turbopumps (HPOTPs). The replacement bearings consisted of standard <b>balls</b> and <b>races</b> with a special Battelle Self-Lubricating Insert Configuration (BASIC) retainer. The BASIC retainer consists of a phosphor bronze housing with inserts consisting of a polytetrafluoretheylene (PTFE) and bronze compound. The PTFE contacts the balls and the land guiding surface on the outer race. A PTFE transfer film is formed on <b>balls</b> and <b>races,</b> which lubricates the critical interfaces. The BASIC retainer is a one-to-one replacement for the current Armalon retainer, but has superior lubricating properties and is stronger over the broad temperature range anticipated for the HPOTP bearings.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{an analytical}} and experimental {{investigation into the}} dynamics of an automatic dynamic balancer (ADB) designed to quench vibration in eccentric rotors. This fundamentally nonlinear device incorporates several balancing masses that are free to rotate in a circumferentially mounted <b>ball</b> <b>race.</b> An earlier study into the steady state and transient response of the device with two balls is extended {{to the case of}} an arbitrary number of balls. Using bifurcation analysis allied to numerical simulation of a fully nonlinear model, the question is addressed of whether increasing the number of balls is advantageous. It is found that it is never possible to perfectly balance the device at rotation speeds comparable with or below the first natural, bending frequency of the rotor. When considering practical implementation of the device, a modification is suggested where individual balls are contained in separate arcs of the <b>ball</b> <b>race,</b> with rigid partitions separating each arc. Simulation results for a partitioned ADB are compared with those from an experimental rig. Close qualitative and quantitative match is found between the theory and the experiment, confirming that for sub-resonant rotation speeds, the ADB at best makes no difference to the imbalance, and can make things substantially worse. Further related configurations worthy of experimental and numerical investigation are proposed. © 2007 The Royal Society...|$|R
