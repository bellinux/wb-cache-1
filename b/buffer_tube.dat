5000|$|UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle) Stock, {{replaces the}} M93 stock. Shares the {{proprietary}} <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> design with the F93 and M93 stocks.|$|E
50|$|The SIGM400 has a {{telescoping}} skeletonized buttstock. The ACE-style stock {{moves forward}} and rearward in 6 positions. A spring-loaded release underneath the <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> area locks into each position.|$|E
50|$|The rifle has an AR-15-based pistol grip, safety selector, trigger {{group and}} a <b>buffer</b> <b>tube.</b> It was {{influenced}} by the CMMG Mk3 assault rifles. The Mk47 relies on a direct-gas-impingement system.|$|E
5000|$|In other types, an {{aluminum}} rod has several spiral grooves around the outside, in which fibers in <b>buffer</b> <b>tubes</b> are laid. The fiber unit {{is covered with}} a plastic or steel tape, and the whole surrounded with aluminum and steel strands.|$|R
5000|$|Another type {{of design}} uses four {{glass-reinforced}} plastic strength member strands, and loose <b>buffer</b> <b>tubes</b> cabled into an assembly and {{protected by a}} jacket. This is more flexible than the outer cylinder type first described, but does not provide as much protection to the fibers.|$|R
50|$|No metal wires {{are used}} in an ADSS cable. Optical fibers are either {{supported}} in loose <b>buffer</b> <b>tubes,</b> or arranged in a ribbon configuration. To prevent strain on the fibers, most types provide the fibres with excess slack length compared {{to the length of}} the supporting member.|$|R
50|$|The OA-93 is an AR-15 {{derivative}} pistol {{manufactured by}} Olympic Arms. Lacking a buttstock or <b>buffer</b> <b>tube,</b> the OA-93 disperses recoil through {{a specially designed}} flat top upper receiver similar to the Armalite AR-18.|$|E
5000|$|Connectors on polarization-maintaining fiber are {{sometimes}} {{marked with a}} blue strain relief boot or connector body, although this {{is far from a}} universal standard. Sometimes a blue <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> is used on the fiber instead.|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature on}} this rifle {{is the ability}} to quickly change the type of stock. The vz. 58 can appear either with its original fixed stock (in either beech wood or composite material) or folding steel stock, or with one of the many aftermarket stocks available - including AR-15 style stock adapters that mount a <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> to the receiver. The latter usually has the <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> slightly angled down as to compensate for the very low ironsights on the vz. 58. Switching between the various options requires merely removal of a bolt {{at the rear of the}} receiver and swapping in the stock of choice.|$|E
5000|$|A third type {{gets its}} {{strength}} from aramid fiber yarns, which are coated to prevent water wicking. The aramid yarn strength member surrounds a core {{made up of}} multiple <b>buffer</b> <b>tubes,</b> each with a fiber, all surrounding a plastic core. The outer sheath provides protection from water and sunlight. This design does not have as great resistance to crushing.|$|R
25|$|Three key {{characteristics}} of fiber optic waveguides {{can be affected}} by environmental conditions: strength, attenuation and resistance to losses caused by microbending. External optical fiber cable jackets and <b>buffer</b> <b>tubes</b> protect glass optical fiber from environmental conditions that can affect the fiber’s performance and long-term durability. On the inside, coatings ensure {{the reliability of the}} signal being carried and help minimize attenuation due to microbending.|$|R
50|$|Zip-cord style jackets, {{including}} those that contain Aramid yarn as the strength member, can be slipped over multiple fiber strands {{coming out of a}} loose buffer cable to convert it to a complete set of single-fiber cables that can be directly attached to optical connectors. A plastic boot is normally used for strain relief and protection from moisture. Use of a breakout kit enables a fiber-optic cable containing multiple loose <b>buffer</b> <b>tubes</b> to receive connectors without the splicing of pigtails.|$|R
50|$|The Honey Badger was {{developed}} {{with a standard}} M4 upper and lower receiver, a short barrel with a very short gas impingement system and fast rate of rifling twist, integrated detachable customized suppressor, and a proprietary <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> and collapsible stock featuring two prongs. While with the added suppressor it is 3-6 inches longer than the MP5-SD, the weight is nearly identical unloaded.|$|E
5000|$|Carrier tilt is a wear {{issue that}} can arise in some gas piston-based firearm {{operating}} systems. High pressure gas pushes the gas piston back hitting the bolt carrier. This force pushes the bolt carrier {{down into the}} <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> wall. This can lead to increased wear, shaved and/or chipped metal. This in turn {{can lead to a}} loss of accuracy.|$|E
50|$|During the {{development}} of the SA80, a bullpup conversion was made of an AR-18 and a Stoner 63 at Enfield due to the fact they could be used with stocks folded/without stocks which allowed the bullpup conversion and were later chambered in the experimental 4.85x49mm round. A bullpup conversion of the AR-15 was previously considered but the <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> in stock prevented the idea.|$|E
50|$|The {{company also}} {{manufactured}} tube stompboxes {{such as the}} Hotbox, the Hotbox II, the Dirtbox (higher gain version of the Hotbox), the Coolbox (a Booster pedal), the Splitbox (a <b>tube</b> <b>buffered</b> signal splitter), the Mixbox (a <b>tube</b> <b>buffered</b> mixer), and the Vibrobox (a tube tremolo effect), as well an echo/delay pedal called the Echobox, which employed a tape format from an adapted cassette.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{different}} styles of OPGW are made. In one type, between 8 and 48 glass optical fibers are placed in a plastic tube. The tube is inserted into a stainless steel, aluminum, or aluminum-coated steel tube, with some slack length of fiber allowed to prevent strain on the glass fibers. The <b>buffer</b> <b>tubes</b> are filled with grease to protect the fiber unit from water {{and to protect the}} steel tube from corrosion, the interstices of the cable are filled with grease. The tube is stranded into the cable with aluminum, aluminium alloy or steel strands, similar to an ACSR cable. The steel strands provide strength, and the aluminum strands provide electrical conductivity. For very large fiber counts, up to 144 fibers in one cable, multiple tubes are used.|$|R
40|$|Understanding of heat {{transfer}} processes between a solid boundary and an oscillatory gas flow {{is important for}} the design of internal components such as heat exchangers, regenerators and thermal <b>buffer</b> <b>tubes</b> in thermoacoustic and Stirling thermodynamic machines where the flow oscillations are part of the power production or transfer processes. The {{heat transfer}} between the flow and an arrangement of hot and cold plates forming a parallel-plate channel is studied experimentally and numerically. Here, the particular focus is on the processes occurring within the thermal and viscous boundary layers. The measured phase-dependent temperature fields combined with the velocity fields are studied in detail. Near wall temperature minima and maxima of the cross sectional temperature profiles are observed when the gas moves from cold to hot or from hot to cold parts of the channel. They are referred to as “temperature undershoot” and “overshoot”, respectively. The existence of these temperature minima and maxima causes large local temperature gradients in the direction normal to the wall, which result in large heat diffusion between gas layers in the direction normal to the wall. It is observed that the flow history has a strong impact on the temperature fields. This invalidates the so-called “Iguchi hypothesis”, based on which the heat transfer data for steady flows is being applied to oscillatory flow conditions. General guidelines for the design of heat exchangers used in thermoacoustic devices are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|HK416C: The ultra-compact variant, with [...] "C" [...] for Commando. The HK416C has a 228 mm {{barrel and}} is {{expected}} to produce muzzle velocities of approximately 730 m/s. The firearm's precision is specified as ≈ 4 MOA (12 cm at 100 m) by Heckler & Koch. The HK416C has a high degree of component commonality with the HK416 family, but uses a shortened <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> and a collapsible butt-stock similar to variants of H&K's MP5 sub-machine gun and the HK53 carbine.|$|E
50|$|Also notable is the rifle's {{capability}} {{to use a}} fully folding and adjustable skeletal stock. Most AR-15/M16 rifle variants have a thick, cylindrical recoil <b>buffer</b> <b>tube,</b> more properly called the receiver extension, that protrudes approximately 20 cm straight back {{from the rear of}} the receiver, and the firearm cannot operate without it. This normally precludes the use of anything but fixed or telescoping stocks. The LR 300 however uses an adapted version of the AR-15's standard direct impingement gas operating system which removes the need for a receiver extension.|$|E
5000|$|In {{fiber optics}} communications, a soft gel {{resembling}} [...] "hair gel" [...] in viscosity {{is used to}} fill the plastic tubes containing the fibers. The main purpose of the gel is to prevent water intrusion if the <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> is breached, but the gel also buffers the fibers against mechanical damage when the tube is bent around corners during installation, or flexed. Additionally, the gel acts as a processing aid when the cable is being constructed, keeping the fibers central whilst the tube material is extruded around it.|$|E
30|$|Animals {{of group}} I were served as control animals. Animals were checked {{for the body}} weight, food and water intake on a daily basis. After 14  days, all animals were {{weighted}} and sacrificed, collected the blood in citrate <b>buffer</b> containing <b>tubes</b> and all the organs such as heart, kidney, spleen, and liver were havested. Immediately after collection of the organs, they are weighted and one part was stored in neutral buffered formalin (pH  7.4) for histological analysis and another part was kept in the refrigerator at −[*] 20  °C for further studies. The collected blood was centrifuged at 8000  rpm and separated the plasma and stored in a refrigerator at −[*] 20  °C for further analysis.|$|R
30|$|Phantoms {{containing}} eleven tubes with {{mixtures of}} varying proportions of two contrast agents (i.e. two selected from gadolinium, iodine or gold nanoparticles) were prepared {{so that the}} attenuation of each tube was about 280 HU. Scans were acquired at 120 kVp and 100  mAs using a five-bin preclinical SPCCT prototype, generating conventional, water, iodine, gadolinium and gold images. The correlation between prepared and measured concentrations was assessed using linear regression. The cross-contamination was measured for each material as the {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) of its concentration in the other material images, where no signal was expected. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) relative to a phosphate <b>buffered</b> saline <b>tube</b> was calculated for each contrast agent.|$|R
30|$|DNA was {{extracted}} from ten replicate subsamples of A, B, and C using the automated Maxwell 16 Cell Total RNA Purification Kit with the Maxwell 16 Instrument (Promega) {{set to the}} LEV (low elution volume) configuration. Specifically, samples were loaded into the pre-dispensed reagent cartridges along with 400 μl RNA lysis buffer and 400 μl RNA dilution <b>buffer.</b> Elution <b>tubes</b> containing 100 μl nuclease-free water, plungers, and cartridges containing the sample and buffers were placed within the instrument and all subsequent steps were automated following the pre-programmed DNA extraction protocol. The DNA-removal steps of the Total RNA Purification Kit protocol were omitted to preserve the DNA (Promega Field Application Specialist, personal communication).|$|R
50|$|When {{the bolt}} release is locked {{down by the}} bolt latch release lock on the <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> sleeve, the gun {{functions}} in fully automatic mode. Conversely, the bolt release can be unlocked into the up position resulting in single-shot firing (the gunner must press the bolt latch release to send the bolt forward). Unlike virtually all other modern machine guns, it has no safety (although a sliding safety switch has recently been fielded to USMC armorers for installation on their weapons and is standard-issue for the U.S. Army for all M2s). Troops in the field {{have been known to}} add an improvised safety measure against accidental firing by slipping an expended shell casing under the butterfly trigger. The upgraded M2A1 has a manual trigger block safety.|$|E
50|$|Starting in 2017 a new {{aftermarket}} {{stock option}} {{has been created}} bringing these classic rifles into the modern era. The HT60 Tactical Adjustable stock created by the Veteran owned business Hunting Tactical allows gun owners to combine their trusty Marlin/Glenfield with modern shooting accessories like rail-mounted laser sights, lights, foregrips, and more. Made of Mil-Spec polymers, the Hunting Tactical package features an industry standard <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> with a six-point pivoting adjustable stock, a pistol grip that allows the user to adjust the rake angel for maximum comfort, a rail mounted grip system that adjusts to fit shooters {{of all ages and}} sizes, and an adjustable front tri-Picatinny rail system that works together to help you get more out of your Model 60, 70*, and 795.|$|E
5000|$|The weapon has a suppression-ready fluted barrel, {{which is}} lighter and cools better than {{previous}} M4 barrels. It is {{claimed to have}} [...] "markedly better" [...] accuracy. To improve reliability, Colt used an articulating link piston (ALP) which [...] "reduces the inherent stress in the piston stroke by allowing for deflection and thermal expansion". In traditional gas piston operating systems, {{the force of the}} piston striking the bolt carrier can push the bolt carrier downwards and into the wall of the <b>buffer</b> <b>tube,</b> leading to accelerated wear and even chipped metal. This is known as carrier tilt. The ALP allows the operating rod to wiggle to correct for the downward pressure on the bolt and transfers the force straight backwards in line with the bore and buffer assembly, eliminating the carrier tilt. This relieves stress on parts and helps to increase accuracy.|$|E

50|$|The two {{processors}} communicated {{through four}} pairs of FIFO <b>buffers</b> in the <b>Tube</b> ULA. Console input/output, error messages, data transfers and system calls each {{had their own}} pair of buffers, one for each direction. The queue capacity varied between 1 and 24 bytes, depending on the dedicated buffer function. Each buffer had a control register and status register to monitor its state and configure the raising of interrupts.|$|R
30|$|About 50 [*]μl of {{peripheral}} blood was {{collected from the}} caudal vein of the specimens on each sampling time using heparinized 1 -ml disposable syringes and transferred to 1 -ml eppendorf tube containing 450 [*]μl of chilled Ca++- and Mg++- free phosphate <b>buffer</b> saline. The <b>tube</b> was placed on ice for its further use in MN test, viability test, and for CA. After blood collection, the specimens were transferred to separate water tanks.|$|R
50|$|The CM901 (Colt Modular) {{weapons system}} {{is based on}} Colt's {{existing}} M16/M4 military designs. It shares the direct gas impingement operation, as well {{as much of the}} action, controls, and basic aesthetics with previous Colt rifle designs. The system's heart is a common lower receiver housing an enlarged magazine well that will accommodate larger caliber ammunition than NATO 5.56×45mm rounds, ambidextrous controls for the bolt release mechanism, magazine release, and fire selector/safety lever, trigger group, pistol grip, telescopic stock, and <b>buffer</b> <b>tube.</b> The system will accept a series of upper receiver assemblies that contain the respective action required to accommodate the various caliber rounds accepted by the weapon. A re-designed upper receiver firing standard 5.56mm ammunition will be produced in various barrel lengths, all having a monolithic design with a full-length top rail, and three auxiliary rails for mounting accessories, free-floating barrels, and front and rear flip-up sights standard, when not using upgraded optics.|$|E
50|$|The {{belt feed}} lever was {{connected}} to the belt feeding pawl at the front end, had a cam pin at the rear end which ran through a track {{in the top of the}} bolt, and a pin in the feed tray cover acted as the pivot between the two ends. The rearward movement of the bolt caused the rear end of the feed lever to pull to the right, causing the feeding pawl at the other end to move left over the belt. The pawl would pull the belt further to the right as the bolt came forward again, also sending the loose M1 link of the previous round to be taken out of the belt to fly out the right side of the receiver. A recoil <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> extended from the back of the receiver to make the cycle of the bolt smoother than previous designs, to absorb some of the recoil of the bolt, and formed a place for the pistol grip to be installed.|$|E
50|$|Complicating the Army {{search for}} higher {{reliability}} in the M4 {{is a number}} of observations of M4 gas piston alternatives that suffer unintended design problems. The first {{is that many of}} the gas piston modifications for the M4 isolate the piston so that piston jams or related malfunction require the entire weapon be disassembled, such disassembly cannot be performed by the end user and requires a qualified armorer to perform out of field, whereas almost any malfunction with the direct-impingement system can be fixed by the end user in field. The second is that gas piston alternatives use an off-axis operation of the piston that can introduce carrier tilt, whereby the bolt carrier fails to enter the <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> at a straight angle, resulting in part wearing. The third is that the use of a sound suppressor results in hot gases entering the chamber, regardless of a direct-gas impingement or gas piston design choice. The gas piston system may also cause the firearm to become proprietary to the manufacturer, making modifications and changes with parts from other manufacturers difficult.|$|E
30|$|The drug release {{study was}} {{performed}} by dialysis method. Briefly, 5  mg equivalent of GEN nanoparticles were suspended in 1  ml of release buffer (PBS, pH  7.4) and transferred to a dialysis tube (MWCO: 3500). The dialysis tube {{was placed in a}} Falcon tube containing the 25  ml of release <b>buffer.</b> The Falcon <b>tube</b> was placed in a shaker with gentle stirring at 37  °C. At pre-designated intervals, specific volume of sample was taken and replaced with fresh buffer or media. The drug released from the release medium was studied by HPLC.|$|R
30|$|For the {{measurement}} of glutathione reductase and peroxidase, glutathione {{was removed from the}} supernatant. Briefly describing, 450  μl phosphate buffer was added to 50  μl supernatant and was subject to ultrafiltration (ULTRAFREE- 0.5 Centrifugal Filter Device (UFV 5 BGC 100), Millipore, MA, USA) at 12000 × g at 4 °C for 60  min. The retained fluid in the inner tube was filled up to about 100  μl by the phosphate <b>buffer.</b> The inner <b>tube</b> was rinsed with 100  μl phosphate buffer to combine with the retained fluid. The protein concentration of the sample was quantified using BCA protein assay.|$|R
30|$|The {{effects of}} metal ions on the {{esterase}} activities were investigated by adding monovalent (Li+, Na+, and K+) and divalent ions (Ba 2 +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Mn 2 +, Fe 2 +, Ni 2 +, Cu 2 +, and Zn 2 +) {{to a final}} 10  mM concentration. The pure enzymes (25  μL) were preincubated with each ion (2.5  μL) at 40 °C for 5  min. Subsequently, the enzyme activities were evaluated at 40 °C for 30  min and added with 450  μL of ρ-nitrophenyl acetate substrate and 22.5  μL of optimum pH <b>buffer.</b> The control <b>tube</b> was made {{with the addition of}} 25  μL pure enzyme, 450  μL of ρ-nitrophenyl acetate, and 25  μL of optimum pH buffer.|$|R
