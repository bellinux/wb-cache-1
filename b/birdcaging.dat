40|$|Applications of {{flexible}} pipe {{have been growing}} because of its characteristic features (i. e. low bending stiffness and high axial strength) which are because of various composite and steel layers {{have been used in}} the structure of this pipe. These characteristics make flexible pipeline capable to transfer oil and gas from wellhead to the fixed and floating platforms, or to inject water into the wells. There are a number of technical and economic advantages for the use {{of flexible}} pipe with respect to conventional rigid line pipe. Rapid installation, typically 5 to 10 km per day, and special polymer material (i. e. elimination of needs for cathodic protection) suggest it may be used as a suitable option for installation in harsh environment fields. Furthermore, the pipe exhibits advantageous mechanical performance characteristics with respect to strength, collapse resistance, thermal expansion and vibration response, and fatigue and abrasion resistance. Flexible pipe comprises of carcass and pressure armours which are interlocked layer wrapped with angle close to 90 degree and stand toward radial pressures; extruded polymer layers which prevents leakage of fluids to the other layers; high strength tape which are considered to prevent radial expansion of tensile armours; tensile armours which are rectangular cross section helical wires with pitch angle close to 35 degrees made by high strength steel to stand for axial and bending and torsional loads. For deepwater flexible pipe systems, in response to local damage and loss of constraint, the tensile armour wires may exhibit two forms of local instability that includes radial buckling (i. e., <b>birdcaging)</b> and lateral buckling. These two failure modes may occur during installation or operational conditions due to pure axial compression and bending curvature. Due to the complex mechanics for integrating the mechanical response of each layer and the corresponding interactions between adjacent layers, there are few analytical and numerical modelling studies addressing the mechanical performance of composite flexible pipe. These investigations are constrained by the underlying idealizations and assumptions used, and the available hardware and software technology. As the technology development and fabrication of flexible pipe is company-specific proprietary, intellectual property, there are few experimental studies available in the public domain. To improve knowledge, and potentially advance current engineering design and practice, it is important to develop a thorough understanding of the pipe mechanical response, strength performance limits and deformation mechanisms. The main goals and major contributions in this thesis are the development and advancement of three-dimensional finite element modelling procedures investigating the local radial and lateral buckling of the tensile armour wires in flexible pipe. This investigation has provided new knowledge and insight, which is either incremental or unique, on these local instability mechanisms for tensile armour wires. The importance of using an implicit solver rather than the traditional use of an explicit solver has also been established. The simplifying assumptions of existing finite element and analytical models mostly have been improved and built sufficient reliability to be used for the different industrial practices. The significance of pipe model characteristics (e. g., element type, topology, segment length), interlayer contact formulations, boundary conditions (i. e., natural, essential), interface friction, hydrostatic loads, damage condition, and curvature on the local instability mechanisms have been examined which is another unique step for consolidating the design standards...|$|E
40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} today is a heavily regulated segment, and current standard hasestablished restrictions which yields a very limited weather window for offshore cable installations. This is due to experience with cable failure in harsh weather. A limiting factor in current practice is the design criterion for the minimum allowable radius of curvature in the touchdown point. In addition, current practice does not allow for occurrence of compression in the touch down zone, since this is associated with loop formation and loss of the functionality of the cable. The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate the validity and conservatism of current practice, by investigating the issues related to torsion instability through a proposed design procedure. The scope of the thesis comprehends numerical analyses using the SINTEF OCEAN developed software SIMLA. The numerical studies concern a J-lay installation scenario at 100 meters water depth with an implemented cable laying vessel with realistic RAO properties. Two real-life cable cross-sections are evaluated; a single-layered cable without armoring (umbilical 1) and a torsional balanced cable with double-armoring (umbilical 2). The mechanical properties of these are calculated analytically, where the main differences lay in the torsional stiffness of the cross-sections. The effect of installation route is evaluated, and two scenarios are simulated; an end cap turn and a curved route to avoid obstacles. The results are obtained in two steps. Primarily, the critical values of torsion momentand resultant curvature with respect to loop formation are established. These parameters are determined for both a linear and a non-linear pipe material model. Subsequently a range of dynamic analyses with irregular waves are carried out. The irregular waves are applied using a Pierson-Moskowitz wave spectrum with Hs= 2 − 3 mandTp= 7 − 10 s with a one hour simulation time. In the dynamic analyses, the torsion moment and curvature in the cable are analyzed and compared with the capacity parameters for each scenario. For umbilical 1 it is found that the maximum resultant curvature for all sea states exceeds the critical API curvature, while the torsion moment is below the critical torsion moment. The sea states can, due to excess of the API criterion, not be classified as acceptable. It is also concluded that a contributing factor is the low magnitude of the horizontal bottom tension. The maximum resultant curvature for umbilical 2 oscillates around curvature values below the design criterion for minimum radius of curvature for all sea states. The torsion moments are lower than the critical torsion moment. All seastates for umbilical 2 are categorized as acceptable with respect to experienced resultant curvature. It is in addition investigated whether the cables experience compression in the touch down zone while subjected to irregular waves. For umbilical 1 it is found that compression occurs inthe touch down zone for all sea states for both installation scenarios. Umbilical 2 experiences compression in varying degree for all sea states except for Hs= 2 m,Tp= 7 s. The magnitude of the compressive axial force is increasing in accordance with increasing wave height andperiod. The magnitude of the compressive axial forces experienced are compared with the buckling loads associated with local helix buckling and <b>birdcaging.</b> None of the force values are within the range for the buckling loads for tensile armour buckling. Hence it can be concluded that its possible with occurrence of compression without necessarily associated kink formation nor local buckling. The effect of wave heading is also investigated. Changing the wave heading impacts the maximum resultant curvature. It is found that the most critical scenario occur when the waves are incoming with a heading of [π, 2 π]. This is due to the cable configuration, which experience a slight bend in the touch down zone at the initiation of the dynamics. It is also carried out a study of the effect of additional sea current. A current velocity of 4 m/s with correspondingly heading of 0 °, 90 °, 180 °, 270 ° is applied. This result in the observation that the most critical scenario is a current heading of 180 ° due to reduction of the cable effective weight. It is investigated whether a too low horizontal bottom tension is the reason of the severe curvature levels for umbilical 1. Analyses with a T 0 = 5 kN are run for the respective sea states. Resulting from this the curvature levels for umbilical 1 is lowered to acceptable levels for Hs= 2 m. The same analyses are carried out for umbilical 2, where the resulting curvatures increase compared to lower initial tension. This is due to severe yielding of the friction moment for the case of T 0 = 5 kN, inducing more severe deformation of the cable...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} {{performance}} of <b>birdcage,</b> transverse electromagnetic (TEM) and microstrip volume coils at 7 T under the same geometric conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: <b>Birdcage,</b> TEM, and microstrip coils are modeled with the same dimensions. The finite difference time domain (FDTD) method is adopted to calculate the electromagnetic fields of the coils. Further, B(1) field, specific absorption rate (SAR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are calculated for these coils. RESULTS: In the unloaded case, within the central axial plane, the variation of B(1) field magnitude over 18 -cm distance is about 15 % for the <b>birdcage</b> coil, 23 % for the TEM coil, and 38 % for the microstrip coil. In the loaded case, the percentages of the samples on the central axial plane, which have B(1) field magnitude within +/- 20 % of the average B(1) field magnitude, are about 57 % for the <b>birdcage,</b> 72 % for the TEM, and 59 % for the microstrip coil. Average SAR levels are 11. 4 % and 42. 9 % higher in the <b>birdcage</b> {{than those in the}} TEM and microstrip coils, respectively. The average relative SNR on the central axial plane for the shielded <b>birdcage,</b> TEM, and microstrip coils are 1, 1. 07, and 1. 48, respectively. CONCLUSION: The <b>birdcage</b> coil has the best unloaded B(1) field homogeneity, and the TEM coil has the best loaded B(1) field homogeneity and the lowest radiation loss; while the microstrip coil is better in SAR and SNR at 7 T than the <b>birdcage</b> and TEM coils. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
