5|$|Another Trojan in this wave, TorrentLocker, {{initially}} {{contained a}} design flaw comparable to CryptoDefense; it {{used the same}} keystream for every infected computer, making the encryption trivial to overcome. However, this flaw was later fixed. By late-November 2014, {{it was estimated that}} over 9,000 users had <b>been</b> <b>infected</b> by TorrentLocker in Australia alone, trailing only Turkey with 11,700 infections.|$|E
5|$|Four orthopoxviruses cause {{infection}} in humans: variola, vaccinia, cowpox, and monkeypox. Variola virus infects only humans in nature, although primates {{and other animals}} have <b>been</b> <b>infected</b> in a laboratory setting. Vaccinia, cowpox, and monkeypox viruses can infect both humans and other animals in nature.|$|E
5|$|In the US, 58% of the {{population}} <b>is</b> <b>infected</b> with HSV-1 and 16% <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> with HSV-2. Among those HSV-2-seropositive, only 19% were aware they <b>were</b> <b>infected.</b> During 2005–2008, the prevalence of HSV-2 was 39% in blacks and 21% in women.|$|R

By December 2008 more than 10,000 people had <b>been</b> <b>infected</b> {{in all but one}} of Zimbabwe's provinces and the {{outbreak}} had spread to Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa and Zambia. On 4 December 2008 the Zimbabwe government declared the outbreak to be a national emergency and asked for international aid.|$|E
5|$|The addax {{are most}} prone to parasites in moist climatic conditions. Addax have always <b>been</b> <b>infected</b> with {{nematodes}} in the Trichostrongyloidea and Strongyloidea superfamilies.

5|$|This is a categorized, {{alphabetical}} list {{of people}} who are known to have <b>been</b> <b>infected</b> with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the pathogen that causes AIDS, including those who have died. AIDS is a pandemic. In 2007, an estimated 33.2million people lived with the disease worldwide, and it killed an estimated 2.1million people, including 330,000 children. Over three-quarters of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
50|$|FIV and HIV {{are both}} lentiviruses. However, humans cannot <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> by FIV, nor can cats <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> by HIV. FIV is {{transmitted}} primarily through saliva (bites), {{such as those}} incurred during territorial battles between males. Cats housed exclusively indoors are {{much less likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>infected,</b> provided they do not come in contact with infected cats.|$|R
40|$|Of 78 Gabonese {{individuals}} who had received bites from nonhuman primates (NHPs) while hunting, 7 <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV- 1). Five had been bitten by gorillas and <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with subtype B strains; however, a 12 -year-old girl who was severely bitten by a Cercopithecus nictitans <b>was</b> <b>infected</b> with a subtype D strain that was {{closely related to the}} simian T lymphotropic virus (STLV- 1) that infects this monkey species. Her mother <b>was</b> <b>infected</b> with a subtype B strain. These data confirm that hunters in Africa can <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> by HTLV- 1 that is closely related to the strains circulating among local NHP game. Our findings strongly suggest that a severe bite represent a risk factor for STLV- 1 acquisition...|$|R
40|$|Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) was {{isolated}} from 11 % of 148 Hmong children under 1 year old with diarrhea at {{a refugee camp}} in northern Thailand. Of 16 children with EPEC-associated diarrhea, 11 <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with EPEC that adhered to HeLa cells in a diffuse pattern, 3 <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with EPEC that adhered to HeLa cells in a localized adherence (LA) pattern, and 2 <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with EPEC that were nonadherent. In Bangkok, EPEC {{was isolated}} from 6 % of 64 children under 1 year old with diarrhea and 7 % of 56 children {{of the same age}} without diarrhea. Of four children with diarrhea, two <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with EPEC with an LA pattern, and two <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with nonadherent EPEC. Of four children without diarrhea, one <b>was</b> <b>infected</b> with EPEC with an LA pattern, one <b>was</b> <b>infected</b> with EPEC that adhered in a diffuse pattern, and two <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with nonadherent EPEC. The 21 EPEC isolates with an LA pattern hybridized with the EPEC adherence factor DNA probe. EPEC was the only enteric pathogen identified in 16 (80 %) of 20 children with EPEC-associated diarrhea. EPEC was as frequently isolated from children under 1 year old as were other bacterial enteric pathogens. The problem of identifying EPEC with pools of polyvalent antisera are described, and the need to identify additional enteropathogenic determinants of EPEC is discussed...|$|R

To {{cut out the}} lengthy time {{it would take to}} obtain informed consent from infected patients, Dr. Hextall inoculates herself with the experimental vaccine and immediately visits her gravely ill father (Dan Flannery), who has <b>been</b> <b>infected</b> with MEV-1. The doctor does not contract MEV-1 and the vaccine is declared a success.|$|E
5|$|Viruses infect all {{cellular}} life and, although viruses occur universally, each cellular {{species has}} its own specific range that often infect only that species.

5|$|During the 1990s, students, trade unionists, {{and other}} workers often {{demonstrated}} {{to express their}} growing discontent with Mugabe and Zanu-PF party policies. In 1996, civil servants, nurses, and junior doctors went on strike over salary issues.

25|$|Most {{people who}} <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> {{with only a}} small number of worms have no symptoms.

40|$|Almost one {{in every}} {{two people in the}} {{developing}} world <b>is</b> <b>infected</b> with one or more types of intestinal nematode worms. When fewer than 50 % of people <b>are</b> <b>infected,</b> most carry only a few worms; but when more than 50 % <b>are</b> <b>infected,</b> the number carrying moderate to heavy numbers increases markedly, as does the risk of disease. The WHO recommends annual mass deworming of children when 20 % or more <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> and twice a year if 50 % or more <b>are</b> <b>infected.</b> We estimated the cost of this to treat children with 10 + worms, an arbitrary moderate to heavy infection. We concluded that it is not cost-effective to mass treat children when fewer than 40 % <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> because the majority are uninfected and few are likely be diseased. We propose annual treatment when 40 % or more children <b>are</b> <b>infected,</b> twice a year at 60 %, and three times a year at 80 % or more. This would cost USD 224 million annually to treat all children aged 2 – 14 years in 107 developing countries compared with USD 276 million using current WHO guidelines. The new three-tier guidelines also treat a larger proportion of infected children and treat children with moderate to heavy worm burdens more often...|$|R

Only two men from the regiment had not <b>been</b> <b>infected</b> in any way.|$|E
5|$|Mast cells {{reside in}} {{connective}} tissues and mucous membranes, and regulate the inflammatory response. They {{are most often}} associated with allergy and anaphylaxis. Basophils and eosinophils are related to neutrophils. They secrete chemical mediators {{that are involved in}} defending against parasites and play a role in allergic reactions, such as asthma. Natural killer (NK cells) cells are leukocytes that attack and destroy tumor cells, or cells that have <b>been</b> <b>infected</b> by viruses.|$|E

5|$|Roughly {{one-third of}} the world's {{population}} has <b>been</b> <b>infected</b> with M. tuberculosis, with new infections occurring in about 1% of the population each year. However, most infections with M. tuberculosis do not cause TB disease, and 90–95% of infections remain asymptomatic. In 2012, an estimated 8.6 million chronic cases were active. In 2010, 8.8 million new cases of TB were diagnosed, and 1.20–1.45 million deaths occurred, most of these occurring in developing countries. Of these 1.45 million deaths, about 0.35million occur in those also infected with HIV.|$|E
