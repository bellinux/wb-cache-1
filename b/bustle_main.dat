5000|$|Part of the {{original}} New Netherland, the first European settlers were the Dutch who settled Kinderhook around 1665, and named this area [...] "Vaaltje", which means [...] "little falls". [...] The first post office was established in 1832. By the early 19th century there were nine cotton mills in Valatje operating on power derived from the famous waterfalls; the village was incorporated in 1856.

50|$|In 2007 Dartford saw an {{increase}} in the number of chain stores located in the town as B&Q, M&S Simply Food, TK Maxx and Asda Living opened new outlet stores in the town centre. Before this Safeway had taken part in the development of Dartford's second shopping centre, The Orchards, located next to the Orchard Theatre. The Safeway's site was eventually taken over by Waitrose but this closed in March 2014 and a new Aldi store opened in June 2015. The historical and once <b>bustling</b> <b>main</b> High Street and adjacent shopping centre, The Priory, continue to decline, and went into receivership in 2013. and the large department store previously occupied by the Co-operative has now been demolished, having been bought by Dartford Borough Council. The oldest independent business still trading in Dartford, the butchers Richardson & Sons in Lowfield Street, established in 1908, closed down in 2014 to make way for the proposed Lowfield centre superstore development. The problems with obtaining planning permission for this development and associated residential units were compounded by the recession. This created persistent delay in regeneration of the Lowfield Street site, and on 8 January 2015 it was finally announced that the Tesco plans were to be abandoned.|$|R
50|$|Just {{a five-minute}} drive south on Hyde Park Road (County Hwy 20) {{from the village}} of Ilderton takes you into the Hyde Park district,(the far north-west fringe of the City of London), with London-Middlesex EMS Station #14 serving Ilderton; and home to two SmartCentre outdoor malls at Hyde Park at Fanshawe Park East (County Highways 20 & 22) with {{retailers}} such as Wal-Mart, Canadian Tire, and many other retail outlets, as well as branches of all five of Canada's largest banks. Further east, in the Masonville district (also north London) are more shopping centres and an indoor mall (Masonville Place), hosting an IMAX Movie Theatre, and brand name stores such as the Apple Store, Forever XXI, and Target (2013). The mall, just north of the Western University district; offers everything to residents of Ilderton within a ten-minute drive, while just five more minutes south sees you in London (proper) with its wide variety of restaurants, bars, stores and entertainment venues including The Western Fair & Casino. 40 minutes drive gets you to either of the nearby Great Lakes. Grand Bend is a popular summer destination with its miles of beach, <b>bustling</b> <b>main</b> street, golf courses, lively bars and patios and summer-themed stores.

50|$|Wise and pious, {{very focused}} on charity and good works, she lived at the Château of Chantilly, {{choosing}} to reside in a cottage ("Sylvie's House") in the park in order to escape the <b>bustle</b> of the <b>main</b> building.

5|$|Once {{out of the}} village, NY17A and NY94 {{begin to}} climb again, this time {{offering}} some panoramic views to the north, {{all the way to}} the Shawangunk Ridge and even the Catskill Mountains beyond them in clear enough weather. The road is surprisingly little developed in this area, with only one gas station between Florida and Warwick, its next stop, which likewise presents itself after a descent. Again, NY17A and NY94 serve as the <b>bustling</b> village's <b>main</b> street, longer this time and with many upscale boutiques in evidence. Many historic buildings line the road through Warwick. Near the southern end of the village, the two roads split, with NY94 continuing toward New Jersey while NY17A goes eastward.|$|R

5000|$|Popularly {{known as}} Maha Ganapati Kshetra, Southadka in Belthangandy taluk of Dakshina Kannada {{district}} is hailed {{as one of}} the many siddhi kshetras of the district. Surprisingly, not many from outside the district are aware of the existence of this temple which is located just 20 km away from the pilgrim town of Dharmasthala. Away from the hustle and <b>bustle</b> of the <b>main</b> road, this temple with no formal structure surrounding it, offers a unique experience.|$|R
50|$|The main town of Songadh {{is split}} into two parts; Junagam (old town) and Navagam (new town). Due to rapid {{expansion}} of the town in recent times, Navagam has outgrown the original Junagam and is characterised by the hustle and <b>bustle</b> of the <b>Main</b> Road almost {{any time of the}} day. This is largely due to the Bus Terminal which acts as a hub for cross country buses which are en route to the city of Surat. This passing traffic has bought much trade into Songadh as it is the first town as you enter Gujarat from the East (or the last before you leave from the West).|$|R
50|$|A {{champagne}} room (also {{called a}} champagne lounge or champagne court) is a specialized VIP Room service offered by gentleman's clubs where a customer can purchase time (usually in half-hour increments) with an exotic dancer {{in a private}} room on the premises. Depending {{on the quality of}} the club, the room, which is away from the hustle and <b>bustle</b> of the <b>main</b> club, is well decorated and usually has its own bar. Clubs sell champagne by the glass or by the bottle for both the dancer and the customer. Strippers who have multiple trips to VIP in a given shift will often give their portion of the alcohol to other dancers or customers to reduce the amount they are drinking themselves.|$|R

5000|$|Currently {{the main}} {{use as a}} body of water is as a {{reservoir}} serving the Yarmouth and Broadland areas, owned and operated by the Essex and Suffolk Water Company. There is no public access to the Broad. It has a public boardwalk constructed at the north west side. As a leisure facility the main occupant of the broad is the Norfolk Schools Sailing Association, which has occupied the site since the early 1970s and has built over time a sailing base, slip ways and dinghy park {{at the north end of}} the broad. The Association is a voluntary group that provides sailing training to children and adults within the county of Norfolk. [...] This has created {{a body of water}} that has a very restricted level of human access leaving it an ideal spot within the broadland area for nesting birds away from the tourist <b>bustle</b> of the <b>main</b> rivers.|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} diploma thesis was elaborated as {{an architectural}} {{study of a}} new synagogue in Olomouc according to the assignment. The goal {{of the project was}} to design a synagogue, new place for the Jewish community of Olomouc and Jewish museum on the site of original burnt synagogue. The concept was based on an effort to restore dialogue between private and public (openness vs. closeness of Jewish community) and to connect the individual functions and create a closed functional unit to fulfil the needs of Jewish community, however, also communicate with the public. The complex contains kosher restaurant, museum of Jewish culture, administration, library, community hall, educational room, kosher grocery store, mikveh the ritual bath, chapel and the garden. The block is divided into three buildings connected each other by colonnade and courtyard which opens to adjacent public square {{but at the same time}} is protected from the <b>bustle</b> of the <b>main</b> road...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{has become}} a key word. Self-assessments and peer reviews, quality {{management}} and student polls have become ubiquitous. With all these <b>bustling</b> activities the <b>main</b> element in education, the personal quality of the teacher somehow got lost. If we want to discuss real quality in education, we must first ask what the teacher’s position is. This paper is going to discuss what conditions the teacher must fulfi ll {{in order to be}} a good teacher: what are his demands on himself, what he must he demand from the students? The society also part of this: What must a teacher expect from society in order to be a good teacher? The answers are, briefly: the teacher must be very exacting towards him/herself; he must constantly improve his personal and scientific qualifi cations. The teacher must not be soft towards his/her students. Society must provide him freedom, independence and respect. Yet these are only the prerequisites of quality in education. Key words: quality in teaching, personal development, demands on teachers, demands on students, demands on society. Quality in education “I have been nourished with science since my childhood; and because I was told that through science one could acquire knowledge clear and sure of all that can be useful in one’s life, my wis...|$|R
6000|$|... § VI. We push our way {{on between}} large barges laden with fresh water from Fusina, in round white tubs seven feet across, and {{complicated}} boats full of {{all manner of}} nets that {{look as if they}} could never be disentangled, hanging from their masts and over their sides; and presently pass under a bridge with the lion of St. Mark on its archivolt, and another on a pillar {{at the end of the}} parapet, a small red lion with much of the puppy in his face, looking vacantly up into the air (in passing we may note that, instead of feathers, his wings are covered with hair, and in several other points the manner of his sculpture is not uninteresting). Presently the canal turns a little to the left, and thereupon becomes more quiet, the <b>main</b> <b>bustle</b> of the water-street being usually confined to the first straight reach of it, some quarter of a mile long, the Cheapside of Murano. We pass a considerable church on the left, St. Pietro, and a little square opposite to it with a few acacia trees, and then find our boat suddenly seized by a strong green eddy, and whirled into the tide-way of one of the main channels of the lagoon, which divides the town of Murano into two parts by a deep stream some fifty yards over, crossed only by one wooden bridge. We let ourselves drift some way down the current, looking at the low line of cottages on the other side of it, hardly knowing if there be more cheerfulness or melancholy in the way the sunshine glows on their ruinous but whitewashed walls, and sparkles on the rushing of the green water by the grass-grown quay. It needs a strong stroke of the oar to bring us into the mouth of another quiet canal on the farther side of the tide-way, and we are still somewhat giddy when we run the head of the gondola into the sand on the left-hand side of this more sluggish stream, and land under the east end of the Church of San Donato, the [...] "Matrice" [...] or [...] "Mother" [...] Church of Murano.|$|R
