40|$|This paper won {{the best}} student paper award. TCP is a {{reliable}} transport protocol tuned {{to perform well}} in traditional networks made up of links with low <b>bit-error</b> <b>rates.</b> Networks with higher <b>bit-error</b> <b>rates,</b> such as those with wireless links and mobile hosts, violate many of the assumptions made by TCP, causing degraded end-to-end performance. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a simple protocol, called the snoop protocol, that improves TCP performance in wireless networks. The protocol modifies network-layer software mainly at a base station and preserves end-to-end TCP semantics. The main idea of the protocol is to cache packets at the base station and perform local retransmissions across the wireless link. We have implemented the snoop protocol on a wireles...|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to space-time block codes (STBCs), {{they are able}} to provide both coding gain and diversity gain and have a better <b>bit-error</b> <b>rate</b> performance. However, being based on trellis codes, they are more complex than STBCs to encode and decode; they rely on a Viterbi decoder at the receiver where STBCs need only linear processing.|$|E
50|$|The actual {{content of}} the payload data is {{typically}} not modelled, but replaced by dummy packets. However, if the payload data is to be analyzed on the receiver side, for example regarding <b>bit-error</b> <b>rate,</b> a Bernoulli process is often assumed, i.e. a random sequence of independent binary numbers. In this case a channel model reflects channel impairments such as noise, interference and distortion.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Bit-Error</b> <b>Rate</b> (BER) {{objective}} for Fibre Channel {{systems is}} 1 in 1012 (1 bit in 1,000,000,000,000 bits). At 2 Gbit/s this equates to seven errors per hour.

The coexistence performance of the two systems is characterized {{in terms of the}} receiver’s <b>bit-error</b> <b>rates.</b> Then, some approaches to interference mitigation are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Example 6: If {{a forward}} error {{correction}} (FEC) code with code rate 1/2 is added, meaning that the encoder input bit rate is one half the encoder output rate, the spectral efficiency is 50% of the modulation efficiency. In exchange for this reduction in spectral efficiency, FEC usually reduces the <b>bit-error</b> <b>rate,</b> and typically enables operation at a lower {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR).|$|E
50|$|Rectangular QAM {{constellation}}s are, in general, sub-optimal in {{the sense}} that they do not maximally space the constellation points for a given energy. However, they have the considerable advantage that they may be easily transmitted as two pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) signals on quadrature carriers, and can be easily demodulated. The non-square constellations, dealt with below, achieve marginally better <b>bit-error</b> <b>rate</b> (BER) but are harder to modulate and demodulate.|$|E
5000|$|A {{bandwidth}} of 1 Gbit/s and a <b>bit-error</b> <b>rate</b> of 10−12 at a {{speed of}} 1 gigabit/s would imply an error every 1000 seconds or once every 1000th transmitted Gbit. Layer 2 thus automatically corrects these errors {{at the cost of}} marginal loss of bandwidth and at the cost of buffer space needed in L2 to store copies of transmitted data frames for possible retransmission or [...] "replay".|$|E

50|$|The <b>bit-error</b> <b>rates</b> of DBPSK and DQPSK are {{compared}} to their non-differential counterparts in the graph to the right. The loss for using DBPSK is small enough compared to the complexity reduction that it is often used in communications systems that would otherwise use BPSK. For DQPSK though, the loss in performance compared to ordinary QPSK is larger and the system designer must balance this against the reduction in complexity.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is readily}} {{apparent}} {{that this is}} a rate-1 code. It takes two time-slots to transmit two symbols. Using the optimal decoding scheme discussed below, the <b>bit-error</b> <b>rate</b> (BER) of this STBC is equivalent to -branch maximal ratio combining (MRC). This {{is a result of the}} perfect orthogonality between the symbols after receive processing [...] - [...] there are two copies of each symbol transmitted and [...] copies received.|$|E
50|$|FEC {{processing}} in {{a receiver}} may {{be applied to}} a digital bit stream or in the demodulation of a digitally modulated carrier. For the latter, FEC {{is an integral part}} of the initial analog-to-digital conversion in the receiver. The Viterbi decoder implements a soft-decision algorithm to demodulate digital data from an analog signal corrupted by noise. Many FEC coders can also generate a <b>bit-error</b> <b>rate</b> (BER) signal which can be used as feedback to fine-tune the analog receiving electronics.|$|E
50|$|The {{orthogonality}} criterion only {{holds for}} columns (1 and 2), (1 and 3), (2 and 4) and (3 and 4). Crucially, however, the code is full-rate and still only requires linear processing at the receiver, although decoding is slightly {{more complex than}} for orthogonal STBCs. Results show that this Q-STBC outperforms (in a <b>bit-error</b> <b>rate</b> sense) the fully orthogonal 4-antenna STBC over a good range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). At high SNRs, though (above about 22 dB in this particular case), the increased diversity offered by orthogonal STBCs yields a better BER. Beyond this point, {{the relative merits of}} the schemes have to be considered in terms of useful data throughput.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This letter {{introduces}} a novel channel coding design framework for short-length codewords that permits balancing the tradeoff between the {{bit error rate}} floor and waterfall region by modifying a single real-valued parameter.
