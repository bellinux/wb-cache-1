50|$|A <b>banjo</b> <b>fitting</b> (also {{called an}} {{internally}} relieved bolt) comprises a perforated hollow bolt and spherical union for fluid transfer. They are {{commonly found in}} automotive fuel, oil and hydraulic systems (e.g.: brakes and clutch). The pipe connected may be either rigid or a flexible hose.|$|E

"H": {{introduced}} in 1937 {{in which the}} float bowl has an arm cast into its base, which mounts {{to the bottom of}} the carburetor with a hollow bolt or <b>banjo</b> <b>fitting.</b> Fuel passes through the arm into the carburetor body. The bolt attaches to the carburetor body just behind the main jet assembly.|$|E
50|$|As a shot is fired, excess (normally waste) {{gas from}} the shot is {{scavenged}} through {{the side of the}} marker via a <b>banjo</b> <b>fitting</b> (a T-type fitting is required for use with the response trigger system). The gas is utilized to rotate the cyclone as the marker re-cocks, force feeding a paintball into the chamber. The Cyclone Feed System comes standard on the Tippmann A-5 and an enhanced version comes on the X-7. Tippmann offers Cyclone upgrades for 98 Custom and Custom Pro users. The advent of the Cyclone Feed System marks the first widely used, non-electronic, agitated hopper. The lack of electronics means the user can expose the system to moisture (rain, snow, etc.) which would interfere with or destroy other mechanical systems.|$|E

50|$|Compared to pipe {{fittings}} that are themselves threaded, <b>banjo</b> <b>fittings</b> {{have the advantage}} {{that they do not}} have to be rotated relative to the host fitting. This avoids risk of damage by twisting the hose when screwing the fitting into place. It also allows the pipe exit direction to be adjusted relative to the fitting, then the bolt tightened independently.|$|R
40|$|EPCO Products {{manufactures}} banjo fittings for use {{in systems}} such as automobile brakes, heating and cooling, and robotics, among many others. Each <b>banjo</b> <b>fitting</b> consists of two cylindrical components joined by brazing. However, the brazing is subcontracted to another company that does not guarantee their work. EPCO wishes to guarantee their products as zero leak, but cannot do this unless each unit is tested to ensure the brazing has properly sealed the two components together. Due to this, EPCO {{is in need of}} a device that will test each fitting for leaks in the brazing before they leave the facility for use. The testing device {{needs to be able to}} adapt to all the various sizes and types of banjo fittings that EPCO manufactures. The device must pressurize each <b>banjo</b> <b>fitting</b> using the line pressure provided at their facility and be quick and easy to operate. The purpose of this report is to completely describe the build process based off of the design described in Report # 1 and the operation of the device...|$|E
