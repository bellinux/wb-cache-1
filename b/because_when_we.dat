2500|$|The {{production}} of facial expressions, however, is not solely limited to interpersonal situations. Since humans are inherently social beings, they often imagine themselves {{in social situations}} {{even when they are}} alone. This phenomenon occurs in a variety of different contexts: treating oneself as a social interactant (talking to oneself), imagining others are present (either who are currently existent or have died), envisioning future social interactions, and personifying animals or inanimate objects (talking to pets). Solitary facial expressions are generated for an imagined other. According to role and impression- management theories, a perceived audience, whether real or imaginary, causes one to assume a role that is consistent with their audience. For example, a young girl may smile to herself in the mirror while imagining herself talking to a boy from class, but may grimace while imagining herself responding to her mother's scolding. Thus, [...] "solitary faces occur for the same reasons as public ones, if only <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are alone we create social interactions in our imaginations. They suggest the possibility that sociality may {{play a major role in}} the mediation of solitary faces". There are developmental differences in solitary facial expression, beginning with instinctive expressions in infancy and developing into more complex ones as a child's concept of sociality and emotion matures.|$|E

40|$|Researchers and {{practitioners}} alike {{believe it is}} not until an organization expands their ERP system that they will reap the full benefits of it. The {{question of how to}} expand an ERP system beyond its core is investigated in this thesis. It is done by reviewing ERP research and comparing this with empirical data collected in a case study made at a focal company. The focal company {{is a member of the}} business network Automation Region. The case describes how the focal company moved from using an ERP system to where they now have an e-procurement system connected to their core ERP and has developed a sales process system which might become their e-commerce system in the future to take control of their supply chain as a whole. It shows how a process thinking view has aided them in putting the customer in focus and incorporating parts of the TQM philosophy. The conclusion reveals that it is crucial to understand and work with processes and there are motives and obstacles to consider when expanding an ERP system. It furthermore uncovers the importance of giving this expansion of the ERP system, the move beyond the core ERP, a proper name such as Extended ERP, eERP. It is important <b>because</b> then, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> understand the eERP fully, we will be ready for the next level of business which may very well be ERP 2 or Second Generation ERP which incorporates entire business networks...|$|R
