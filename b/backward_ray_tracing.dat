There were two main factors considered in our study to determine the parameters of the devices. The first one – maximum daylight utilization (from energy savings point of view) and the second one – daylight distribution inside the space (on the level required by visual comfort parameters – the illuminance level and the glare index). There were some initial assumptions limiting the number of solutions. The most important was that all the elements of the devices must be permanently fixed and no rotation was permissible. It means that only one solution is required for summer and winter season.

This study analysed the impact of ground surface reflectances and three outdoor lighting fixtures on the potential of lighting pollutions in the landscape lighting design in Beijing. Seven fundamental ground surfaces found in landscape sites were investigated as the follows: new snow (reflectance 0. 8), old snow (reflectance 0. 5), white sand (reflectance 0. 4), grey earth (reflectance 0. 3), grey paving (reflectance 0. 2), grass and green vegetation (reflectance 0. 1), and water surface (reflectance 0. 05). A test plot, covered by the seven materials and lit by three typical outdoor pole luminaires, was used to check how much light would be reflected from the ground.

After the earthquake, the tide stations in the NE Atlantic recorded a small tsunami with maximum amplitudes of 40 cm peak to through in the Azores and Madeira islands. In this study, we present a re-evaluation of the earthquake epicentre location using seismological data not included in previous studies.

40|$|Solving {{the global}} {{illumination}} problem {{is equivalent to}} determining the intensity of every wavelength of light in all directions at every point in a given scene. The complexity of the problem has led researchers to use approximation methods for solving the problem on serial computers. Rather than using an approximation method, such as <b>backward</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> or radiosity, the authors have chosen to solve the Rendering Equation by direct simulation of light transport from the light sources. This paper presents an algorithm that solves the Rendering Equation to any desired accuracy, and can be run in parallel on distributed memory or shared memory computer systems with excellent scaling properties. It appears superior in both speed and physical correctness to recent published methods involving bidirectional ray tracing or hybrid treatments of diffuse and specular surfaces. Like progressive radiosity methods, it dynamically refines the geometry decomposition where required, but does so without the excessive storage requirements for ray histories. The algorithm, called Photon, produces a scene which converges to the global illumination solution. This amounts to a huge task for a 1997 -vintage serial computer, but using {{the power of a}} parallel supercomputer significantly reduces the time required to generate a solution. Currently, Photon can be run on most parallel environments from a shared memory multiprocessor to a parallel supercomputer, as well as on clusters of heterogeneous workstations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We present ELVIS, a new {{approach}} for localizing a first responder (e. g., firefighter) inside a building. We assume that the first responder emits RF energy, which undergoes multiple reflections with the walls, ceilings and floors of the building. There are K receivers, each of which receives ray(s) from the first responder. Each receiver estimates the AOA (Angle of Arrival), TOA (Time of Arrival) and power of each ray. We assume that the receivers know the blueprint {{of the building and}} the electromagnetic characteristics of the construction material used in the building. We show that, based on this information, the receivers can localize the first responder to a high degree of accuracy by applying ELVIS, which is based on <b>backward</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tracing.</b> We have evaluated the performance of ELVIS, using both single and multiple receivers, under a variety of channel and propagation conditions. We find that, the location prediction error depends mostly on the angular resolution of the receiver antennae. One advantage of ELVIS over other RF-based localization methods is that, if AOA is estimated with high degree of accuracy, a single receiver would be sufficient to do localization in 3 D. In this case one could localize 100 % of the Bell Labs, Crawford Hill building within 9 cm. With degraded accuracy, including fading and noise effects, ± 10 degree angular error, and ± 10 ns temporal error, one could localize 80 % of the building within 10 m using multiple receivers.

40|$|Accurate {{localization}} {{of mobile}} phone users {{is needed for}} search and rescue applications or for electronic surveillance in urban or suburban areas. Assuming that the mobile station (MS) has been roughly localized by the cellular network or by any other means, we propose an approach using a single dedicated base station (BS), deployed in the zone where the MS is situated and forcing the MS to transmit. The BS is assuming being able to move along a short route. In previous TDs ((12) 05010 -(13) 06029), a fingerprinting framework was proposed to localize the MS with two BSs in this non-cooperative mode and outdoor Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) conditions. In this work, we prop ose to add a pre processing algorithm to enhance the localization reliability with a single dedicated BS. In the first step, the channel parameters, i. e Relative Time of Arrival (rTOA), Direction of Arrival (DOA) and amplitude {{of the most powerful}} paths that link the BS to the MS are estimated for N locations of the BS along the route. The pre-processing technique consists of computing for each path the point of intersection, called Virtual Point (VP) of the lines corresponding to the DOAs.

In this work, the convention used for directions, is that indicating the azimuth from the incoming waves.

Additionally, the range of the numerically directions obtained for Playa Miramar, as well as the range of discussed frequencies were compared with the corresponding from virtual buoys that represent numeric results from the WAVEWATCH-III model of wave propagation. The results from these comparisons are that the interval of directions obtained (15 ° – 130 °) is localized within the corresponding to virtual buoys (0 ° – 174 °), while that range frequencies considerate are localized outside of the buoys (0. 097 Hz – 0. 380 Hz) for low frequencies...|$|E

40|$|Recognizing the {{applicability}} of tomographic imaging in the ionosphere, the reconstruction method {{has been applied to}} generate more realistic low latitude ionospheric background based on the Ionex TEC data and also direct measurement TEC data over West Bengal, India. Using these backgrounds, <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> of high frequency waves has been performed. Influence of Earth’s magnetic field and also the existence of horizontal gradient of electron concentration in the ionosphere are considered separately for analyzing the <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> algorithm. Evaluation of <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> parameters and maximum usable frequency for different ground range ensures the possibility of application of ionospheric tomography technique for accurate <b>ray</b> <b>tracing.</b> The analysis shows accurate <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> for HF waves, thus defeating the restriction of choice of ionospheric model for analytical <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> methods. Performance analysis of the <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> technique presented in this paper ensures the consistency of speed with the other methods...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years, the well known <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> {{algorithm}} gained new popularity {{with the introduction}} of interactive <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> methods. The high modularity and the ability to produce highly realistic images make <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> an attractive alternative to raster graphics hardware. Interactive <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> also proved its potential in the field of Mixed Reality rendering and provides novel methods for seamless integration of real and virtual content. Actor insertion methods, a subdomain of Mixed Reality and closely related to virtual television studio techniques, can use <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> for achieving high output quality in conjunction with appropriate visual cues like shadows and reflections at interactive frame rates. In this paper, we show how interactive <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> techniques can provide new ways of implementing future virtual studio applications...|$|R
