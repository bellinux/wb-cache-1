We investigated the quality of boiled roots of seven cultivars harvested at 10, 12 and 14 months in three different seasons.

40|$|In Mozambique 97 % of {{the small}} scale farmers grow cassava in 43 % of the total {{cultivated}} land. In 2012 cassava production was estimated at 10. 05 million tons. Cassava {{is the second most}} important staple food after maize. Consumption of cassava is estimated at 85 kg per person per year. In Mozambique the diet is poor in micronutrients and the prevalence of under-nutrition is estimated at 38 %. Anaemia is a serious public health concern, affecting more than 40 % of young children, pregnant and nursing mothers. Cassava mahewu a fermented nonalcoholic beverage prepared using indigenous traditional technology. Fermentation is known to reduce the toxicity of cyanogenic glycosides in both leaves and cassava roots. It also results in higher levels of vitamins, especially the B group, essential amino acids, improves the digestibility of protein and increases the bioavailability of minerals. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether cassava, in the form of mahewu, can be fortified with iron. <b>Bitter</b> and sweet <b>cassava</b> roots and soil samples, were collected from small scale farmers in four Districts of Mozambique. The four Districts are located in intermediate and high production areas of cassava. The concentrations of iron and other minerals such as aluminum, calcium, copper, manganese, phosphorus, lead and zinc in cassava roots and soil, were determined using an inductively coupled-plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), after microwave digestion. Sweet and <b>bitter</b> varieties of <b>cassava</b> from four Districts in Mozambique were fermented in a food laboratory, under controlled conditions (45 °C for 24 hours) and the optimal stage for iron fortification was determined. Samples were collected at hour 0 and hour 24 for microbial analysis, acid concentration and total solids determination. Fortification with ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O) and ferrous fumarate (C 4 H 2 FeO 4) were investigated. The total iron content of the fortified cassava mahewu was determined using Microwave Digestion Accelerated Reaction System (MARS) and ICP-OES, while the bioaccessibility of iron in fortified cassava mahewu was assessed using the in vitro dialysability procedure. Results showed that the mineral content of soil from the four districts differed significantly (p ˂ 0. 05). There was also a significant difference (p ˂ 0. 05) in the mineral concentration of the cassava roots from the four varieties, but no difference between sweet or bitter types. The concentration of minerals was found to be significantly higher in soil, than in roots. This difference was greatest for iron concentration, which was not detectable in the root samples, although soil concentration was up to 24. 78 mg/kg. Although the reason for this was not determined, this lack of iron in the roots supported iron fortification of mahewu. A significant difference (p ˂ 0. 05) in pH was observed between mahewu fortified with ferrous sulfate (4. 5) and ferrous fumarate (4. 3), with the latter being similar to the control. At the beginning of fermentation the acidity was 0. 06 % and at the end 0. 30 %. The total solids of fermented mahewu were 9. 6 %. The microorganisms responsible for fermentation were predominantly lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeast. The pH and acidity was different to that reported in the fermentation of maize mahewu. The fermenting microorganisms and total solids were similar to previous findings for maize mahewu. The total iron content of mahewu fortified with ferrous sulfate was significantly higher (p ˂ 0. 05) than mahewu fortified with ferrous fumarate. Both the amount and percentage of bioaccessible iron were higher in mahewu fortified with ferrous sulfate compared to mahewu fortified with ferrous fumarate. It was found that mahewu made using the <b>bitter</b> variety of <b>cassava</b> and fortified with ferrous sulfate provided a more bioaccessible source of iron. The stage of fortification was not found to affect the total iron content nor the iron bioaccessibility. It was concluded that cassava roots do not take up iron, even when soils are high in this metal. Thus the selection of varieties with better uptake of minerals and fertilization of soils is recommended, but may not increase concentration of essential minerals sufficiently to maintain health in vulnerable communities where cassava is the main staple. This was the first study in which fermentation of traditional cassava mahewu was carried out under repeatable, controlled conditions. It is recommended that fortification occurs at the end of the fermentation when done at household level. However, when flour is being milled in larger villages, it could be fortified prior to sale in informal markets. There is also the possibility of large scale commercial applications. It is concluded that <b>bitter</b> varieties of <b>cassava</b> will deliver more bioaccessible iron to the consumer. Ferrous sulfate is more suitable as iron fortification source for cassava mahewu than ferrous fumarate and also is more stable in mahewu. Fortification of cassava mahewu could contribute to the iron intake of vulnerable population. In addition, although fortification at the end of fermentation would probably be ideal for rural communities, as it could be made available in sugar sprinkled into the traditional product, it was shown that fortification of flour used to make mahewu would result in significantly higher availability. It is recommended that iron fortification of mahewu is implemented both at subsistence and commercial level. This should form part of a communication strategy at community level by the state, in order to improve public health in vulnerable communities in Mozambique.

40|$|Abstract: Cassava root meal {{which has}} been used as good {{alternative}} energy source in poultry and pig diets is increasingly becoming an important energy source for feeding the world’s human population. There are however, several by-products of cassava harvest ranging from the leaves, peels and pulp which have potential as feed ingredients in poultry rations. Cassava peels and pulps are moderate to high in energy and have been included in diets as replacements for conventional energy sources. Cassava leaves, moderate to good protein contents, have been used as protein supplements. Dietary recommendations of cassava by-products for poultry have varied considerably. The major factors limiting the efficient utilization of these by-products in poultry diets include the high fibre and low energy contents and likely presence of antinutritional factors, mainly hydrocyanic acid (HCN) in the <b>bitter</b> variety of <b>cassava.</b> Several technologies have been used to improve the utilization of cassava by-products by poultry. The following paper reviewed the composition of some cassava by-products (leaves, peels and pulp), their recommendations for inclusion in poultry diets and processing methods to maximize their utilization by poultry. It was concluded that efficient use of cassava by-products will reduce feed cost of poultry production and provide additional source of income to cassava farmers and processors...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} retting of cassava roots {{occurs in}} ponds or in backwaters. The medium pH is slightly acidic (pH 5. 54) {{and the pressure}} of dissolved oxygen is very low (pO 2 1. 96). The fermentation of cassava roots lasts for three days in the rainy season (October to April) with an average temperature of 26 °C, but it is longer, 5 - 6 days, in the dry season (May to September) with an average temperature of 23 °C. The fermentation with peeled roots is preferred because it favours the rapid softening of cassava roots and it allows to shorten {{at least one day}} the fermentation duration. In addition, the peeled roots after retting contain less tannin than the unpeeled roots and allow to obtain the alimentary products, fufu and kwanga which have a higher whiteness. The <b>bitter</b> variety of <b>cassava</b> roots is more used in fermentation than the sweet variety. Retted cassava dough is well preserved one to two months in account of anti-microbial compounds produced by lactic acid bacteria. The variability of characteristics of the products obtained from retted cassava roots is the reflection of several factors, including the cassava variety, the environmental conditions and the retting method...|$|R

The experimental design was a 2 x 2 factorial {{in a completely}} randomized design. The reference cyanide content of the cassava pulp determined immediately after grating was 437. 4 ± 15. 2 mg/kg. Results showed that the crude protein content of the fermented groups (Treatments 3 and 4) were {{higher than those of}} the unfermented groups (Treatments 1 & 2).

40|$|Cassava root is {{the main}} staple for 70 % of the {{population}} in Mozambique, particularly in inaccessible rural areas, but is known to be low in iron. Anaemia is a public health problem in mothers and preschool children in Mozambique and up to 40 % of these cases are probably due to dietary iron deficiency. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) recognize the fortification of foodstuff as an effective method to remedy dietary deficiencies of micronutrients, including iron. Cassava mahewu, a non-alcoholic fermented beverage is prepared at subsistence level from cassava roots using indigenous procedures. The aim {{of the study was to}} standardize mahewu fermentation and investigate if the type of cassava fermented, or the iron compound used for fortification affected the final product. Roots of sweet and <b>bitter</b> varieties of <b>cassava</b> from four districts (Rapale, Meconta, Alto Molocue and Zavala) in Mozambique, were peeled, dried and pounded to prepare flour. Cassava flour was cooked and fermented under controlled conditions (45 °C for 24 h). The fermentation period and temperature were set, based on the findings of a pilot study which showed that an end-point pH of about 4. 5 was regularly reached after 24 h at 45 °C. Cassava mahewu was fortified with ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O) or ferrous fumarate (C 4 H 2 FeO 4) at the beginning (time zero) and at the end of fermentation (24 h). The amount of iron added to the mahewu was based on the average of the approved range of iron used for the fortification of maize meal. The mean pH at the endpoint was 4. 5, with 0. 29 % titratable acidity. The pH and acidity were different to those reported in previous studies on maize mahewu, whereas the solid extract of 9. 65 % was found to be similar. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeast growth were not significantly different in mahewu fortified with either of the iron compounds. There was no significant difference between cassava mahewu made from bitter or sweet varieties. A standard method for preparation and iron fortification of cassava mahewu was developed.

40|$|Ethnographers {{report from}} both South America and Africa that cassava farmers {{classify}} cultivars {{as belonging to}} either of two groups, "bitter" or "sweet", and that farmers prefer to grow "bitter" cultivars as the staple crop. It remains contentious if the two groups and whether bitterness in taste reflects the content of cyanogenic glucosides in cassava roots. This is of importance since dietary cyanogen exposure may have adverse health effects. These studies aimed at elucidating the social and biological role of cyanogenesis in a cassava dominated farming and food system in Malawi, where small-scale farmers utilise the soaking method for processing roots from "bitter" cultivars. In 1994 and 1995 a qualitative interview survey in 13 communities in Nkhata-Bay district, in Malawi showed that social factors were {{the main reasons for}} farmers preferring "bitter" cassava. The need to process the roots dictates rigorous planning and bitterness confers protection from theft and vermin. In 1996, determination of urinary linamarin (the cyanogenic glucoside in cassava) and thiocyanate (the main cyanide metabolite) as biomarkers of dietary cyanogen exposure, was conducted on 176 women farmers. The low urinary levels found indicated that dietary cyanogen exposure was negligible inspite of frequent consumption of food made from soaked roots from "bitter" cassava cultivars. In 1996 two roots from 246 plants of the 10 most grown cultivars, about 24 plants from each cultivar were harvested. Farmers' scoring of bitter taste of the root tip was a good predictor of cyanogenic glucoside levels (r = 0. 65). Mean cyanogenic glucoside level in 132 roots from "cool" cultivars was 29 mg HCN eq kg- 1 fresh weight (Cl 25 - 33, range 1 - 123), and in 360 roots from "bitter" cultivars 153 mg (Cl 143 - 163, range 22 - 661). Farmers' distinction of "bitter" and "cool" cultivars predicts glucoside levels (r = 0. 56). Taste scoring for bitterness by the taste panel was strongly correlated (r = 0. 87) with cyanogenic glucoside levels suggesting that cyanogenic glucosides convey the <b>bitter</b> taste in <b>cassava.</b> DNA fingerprinting using SSR-markers showed that farmers had a high ability to distingush plants with specific genotypes as belonging to named cultivars. Their distinction of "bitter" and "cool" cultivars with high and low levels of cyanogenic glucosides appears to have influenced the genetic pool of cassava in this area since the genotypes of the two groups separated into two clusters in principle component analysis. Single women's food security was particularly compromised if they did not opt to grow the "bitter" <b>cassava</b> cultivars. Processing <b>bitter</b> roots was not a problem per se, rather the need for mechanised mills was perceived as the rate-limiting factor. Farmers' ethnoclassification and experience enables them to have more benefits than disadvanatges from cyanogenesis. These findings have implications for cassava breeding and extension programmes...|$|R
40|$|Safe {{storage of}} cassava Cue: Cassava {{is a very}} {{valuable}} food crop, especially in areas with low rainfall. However, some <b>bitter</b> varieties of <b>cassava</b> contain high levels of hydrogen cyanide, a natural poison which can be very damaging to human health. Fortunately, the poison can be removed by careful processing, for example by cutting the cassava into small pieces and soaking it in water. Afterwards, the cassava can either be cooked and eaten, or else dried and stored. Farmers need to ensure that when the crop is drying, it is protected from sources of dirt, such as chickens, dogs or other animals. Using a raised drying rack {{can be a good}} method. And as Patrick Mphaka recently found out, farmers also need to protect their stored cassava from insects and moulds. He sent us this report. IN:		?Cassava is one of the root ? OUT:		? or the moulds, for future use. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 42 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Patrick Mphaka, speaking to Grinja Chitowe, an agricultural field assistant in Blantyre, Malawi. Transcript Mphaka	Cassava is one of the root and tuber crops which is of vital importance to the food security of over one billion people in developing countries including Malawi. However, not every tuber which is harvested is utilized. Some is lost to moulds and weevils, among other post harvest deterioration causes. The protection, storage, and processing are some of the steps that ought to be looked at in order to improve the amounts of the harvested crop for the actual consumption. I learnt some of the ways which can be used to preserve the crop when I talked to Mr. Grinja Chitowe, an agricultural field assistant in Blantyre. Chitowe	There are so many varieties which are grown in the rural areas. These are sweet and bitter varieties. When you want to process cassava, these sweet varieties, you make chips which we call Makaka in Chichewa. And for the bitter varieties, what is recommended is: when it has reached maturity stage, that is around 12 to 15 months, we uproot the cassava and then we submerge it in water for about a week to remove the bitterness. And, we make the chips and we heap them into a heap and then after about 24 hours we put the chips into the water, wash them, clean them, and dry them in the sun. After the chips are well dried, we apply the actellic super and store them in a cool dry place. The actellic is applied at the rate of 25 g of actellic super to a 50 kg bag of cassava chips. Mphaka	What is the purpose of cutting the cassava into small pieces which you are referring to as chips here? Chitowe	As you know, it needs the chips not to take long to dry. So, the purpose of slicing them is to fasten the drying process for it not even to grow the moulds. Mphaka	Would you like to explain a bit why most of the times we see that the cassava pieces which have been stored have got a lot of moulds, what happens? Chitowe	A lot of cassava gets moulds because of the weather pattern. When it is cloudy and the farmers have already made the makaka, they are not dry. If it takes long without any sunny days, sunny periods, it grows moulds. So, after the farmers have experienced these moulds, they have to wash those moulds in clean water, and then re-dry the cassava chips. Mphaka	Is there a difference in taste between the chips which are mouldy and one which is not? Chitowe	The taste is different, because when it grows mouldy, it is rotting. It tastes bad. But if the makaka is processed very well, dried very well, the taste is good. It is palatable. So it is proper to process the makaka or the cassava in a proper way. Mphaka	Surely you don?t use actellic to control the moulds, what do you use the actellic for? Chitowe	When you make makaka it can be attacked by the pests like the weevils. So, when the weevils attack cassava chips, it means it is destroying. So to control these weevils, we have to apply actellic super. Mphaka	Is there any traditional way, other than the use of actellic super? For example in the villages, what can people do? Chitowe	Sometime back, they were just keeping them in a smoking kitchen, but it was not helpful to the farmers because even the weevils were attacking while those bags are kept in a smoked area. Mphaka	What is your advice to farmers who grow, or are planning to grow cassava? Chitowe	We encourage farmers to grow the cassava as a security crop, as you know it needs less moisture. But we need farmers to process it properly because of the bitterness or the moulds, for future use. End of track. Grinja Chitowe, an agricultural field assistant from Blantyre, Malawi, describes how cassava is dried and stored, and a method for removing toxin from the bitter varieties...|$|R

5000|$|The {{character}} of the neurological injury is not clear. The disease onset is associated with high intake of cyanide from a monotonous diet of <b>bitter</b> <b>cassava,</b> which is low in protein, particularly sulfur amino acids. These are essential for the detoxification {{in the body of}} cyanide to thiocyanate, which is removed in the urine. A number of studies implicate the combination of high cyanide intake from <b>bitter</b> <b>cassava</b> and low intake of sulfur amino acids as the cause. It has now been shown that the month by month incidence of konzo is significantly correlated with the percentage of children with high urinary thiocyanate content, which is a measure of their cyanide intake. The importance of an adequate supply of protein sulfur amino acids is shown from three unrelated konzo epidemics in Mozambique, [...] Tanzania and DRC. People of the same ethnic group living only 5 km away from those with konzo had near zero konzo prevalence, because in Mozambique they lived near the sea, in Tanzania they lived near Lake Victoria and had access to fish and in DRC they lived near the forest and had access to animal protein.|$|E
50|$|Cassava, {{like other}} foods, also has antinutritional and toxic factors. Of {{particular}} concern are the cyanogenic glucosides of cassava (linamarin and lotaustralin). On hydrolysis, these release hydrocyanic acid (HCN). The presence of cyanide in cassava {{is of concern}} for human and for animal consumption. The concentration of these antinutritional and unsafe glycosides varies considerably between varieties and also with climatic and cultural conditions. Selection of cassava species to be grown, therefore, is quite important. Once harvested, <b>bitter</b> <b>cassava</b> must be treated and prepared properly prior to human or animal consumption, while sweet cassava can be used after simple boiling.|$|E
40|$|AMD affects {{almost all}} cassava plants For {{a growing number}} of Africans, cassava is a vital crop. It is a staple food in forested areas and a life-saver during famines in savanna areas. 50 million tonnes of fresh tubers are {{produced}} each year in Africa {{and most of them are}} consumed directly by the families who grow them. About 15 years ago, however, cassava cultivation began to be seriously affected by both traditional and newly introduced diseases which have considerably reduced yield (see SPORE N° 4). As its names implies, African Mosaic Disease (AMD) is native to Africa. It is endemic in all cassava producing countries and is estimated to be responsible for losses of 10 - 25 million tonnes per year (the subsistence nature of cassava production means that such data are not well recorded). Because of the impact of this disease a meeting was held from May 4 - 8, 1987 in Yamoussouko, Cote d'lvoire that brought together researchers and officials of producing countries to discuss methods of controlling it. They summarized the state of scientific knowledge on AMD and gave an update on the current situation in the field. This international seminar on controlling AMD was initiated by the FAO, funded primarily by CTA and organized by ORSTOM with the assistance of IITA and CPI. The geminivirus which is responsible for AMD was isolated in Kenya about ten years ago and has since become well known among virologists. It now affects almost all cassava plants and spreads in two ways. A tiny, 1 mm whitefly Bemisia tabaci is responsible for the initial dispersion of the virus through crops by feeding on young leaves. Whitefly populations fluctuate according to weather conditions, notably wind. Favoured by the rainy season in East Africa, they also benefit from the high temperatures found in West Africa It now appears, however, that this fly is not the major means of contamination by or persistence of AMD. It is the farmers themselves who keep re-introducing the disease by planting infected cuttings. Research in Kenya has shown that the whitefly actually plays only a minor role in maintaining the epidemic. As it turns out, it is the cassava itself that harbours the virus and is the main carrier. Infected cassava plants are characterized by leaves covered with yellow blotches. When severely infected, the leaves shrivel up, stunting growth. The degree of such symptoms, which are the only way to recognize AMD, varies according to the means and date of contamination. Plants infected at an early stage (especially as cuttings) are more likely to have their foliage affected and thus produce less. On the contrary, whitefly attacks on wellestablished plants (2 - 3 months old) have hardly any effect on yield. For this and other reasons, whitefly control is somewhat utopian especially in view of the high cost of insecticides and their contamination of edible cassava leaves. Recent epidemiological studies have pointed towards two control strategies. The simplest, sanitation, is ensuring that only healthy cuttings taken from uninfected plants are used in conjunction with the systematic eradication of plants showing symptoms of the disease. Even if this method does not entirely remove the risks of recontamination, it does result in a remarkable increase in production because the disease is restricted to less sensitive, adult plants. Kenya adopted this approach three years ago and other East African countries, notably Malawi, Uganda and Tanzania, are following in its footsteps. However, sanitation alone is not always enough to control AMD, especially when it is strongly entrenched and the whitefly plays a stronger role in its spread, which seems to be the case in many areas of West Africa. This means that sanitary measures must be complemented by the use of resistent varieties. Work in this direction has been undertaken by the IITA which has developed such varieties. By combining thermotherapy with cloning, a virus-free strain has been produced and is now being propagated. Unfortunately, resistent varieties have only been developed for the <b>bitter</b> strains of <b>cassava,</b> which are not only less favoured in many areas but also more difficult to prepare. These strains are also poorly accepted by farmers who do not appreciate their sprawling growth amidst traditional crop associations. A further complication is that infected leaves are more tender and apparently taste better than healthy ones! It thus seems preferable to concentrate on local strains, crossing them with resistant ones, in order to produce plants that are both well adapted to the local environment and please local consumers. In Zaire, a collection of local varieties is being used to establish a planting stock of healthy cuttings thanks to in vitro techniques. Given the rapidity of such a method, plants will soon be able to be distributed to farmers. The development and distribution of healthy cuttings is, in fact, the biggest obstacle to reducing the incidence of AMD in many countries. Most of the resistent strains and healthy cuttings are still found on experimental farms, not farmers' plots. International research institutes have developed appropriate techniques but it is now up to national organizations to see that they are adapted to local conditions and then implemented. Many African officials have noted, however, that their countries cannot afford to invest heavily in an AMD control programme alone given the need to develop a comprehensive package to deal with all cassava pests, including bacteria, scale and mites. Finally, if the goal is to encourage farmers to control cassava diseases in order to increase production, attention must also be given to processing techniques and marketing methods. There is no doubt that cassava can and must be saved.

Iodine deficiency causes endemic goitre and cretinism as well as stunting of mental and physical development. Globally, 1.6 million people are at risk of iodine deficiency disorders and 50 million children affected by them. About 100,000 children are born each year with mental retardation, most of them in Africa. This is due to the low consumption of iodine-rich foodstuffs (e.g. marine products) and the over-consumption of foodstuffs causing goitre, particularly <b>bitter</b> <b>cassava,</b> which is a staple in Central Africa.|$|E

50|$|To make casabe, the starchy root of <b>bitter</b> <b>cassava</b> {{is ground}} to a pulp, then {{squeezed}} to expel a milky, bitter liquid called yare. This carries the poisonous substances with {{it out of the}} pulp. Traditionally, this squeezing is done in a sebucan, an 8 to 12 ft long, tube-shaped, pressure strainer, woven in a characteristic helical pattern from palm leaves. The sebucan usually is hung from a tree branch or ceiling pole, and it has a closed bottom with a loop that is attached to a fixed stick or lever, which is used to stretch the sebucan. When the lever is pushed down, stretching the sebucan, the helical weaving pattern causes the strainer to squeeze the pulp inside. This is similar to the action of a Chinese finger trap. The pulp is spread in thin, round cakes about 2 ft in diameter on a budare to roast or toast.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dose-response}} relationship between konzo incidence and cyanide intake, {{together with the}} prevention of konzo in many villages by reducing cyanide intake from cassava (see below) {{and the importance of}} sulfur amino acids in prevention of konzo, shows that konzo is very likely due to high cyanide/low sulfur amino acid intake in a diet of <b>bitter</b> <b>cassava.</b> Konzo does not occur unless these conditions are met, which occurs only in remote villages in six tropical African countries. The total number of reported cases up to 2009 was 6788, but most cases are never reported and there was an estimate of 100,000 cases in DRC alone in 2002. Konzo is spreading geographically as cassava is being grown in new areas where there is little knowledge of processing methods to remove cyanogens. [...] Konzo epidemics occur due to war which causes disruption of life in poor villages and drought, when the plant increases the cyanogen content of roots 2-4 times and the cyanide content of cassava flour also increases greatly. Konzo is also endemic in certain areas.|$|E
