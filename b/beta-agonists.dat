However, the strength of these associations is limited because many asthma deaths are unwitnessed. We undertook a secondary analysis of data from a 24 -week randomised controlled trial of 303 patients with high-risk asthma, randomised to combination budesonide/formoterol inhaler according to a single maintenance and reliever therapy regimen or fixed dose budesonide/formoterol with salbutamol as reliever (Standard) regimen. Medication use was measured by electronic monitors. The thresholds for high, marked and extreme <b>beta-agonist</b> use days were defined in the single maintenance and reliever therapy arm as: > 8, > 12 and > 16 actuations of budesonide/formoterol in excess of four maintenance doses, respectively; and in the Standard arm as: > 16, > 24 and > 32 actuations of salbutamol, respectively. Whether a medical review was obtained within 48 h of an overuse episode was determined by review of data collected during the study by participant report. The mean (standard deviation) proportion of days in which high, marked and extreme <b>beta-agonist</b> overuse occurred without medical review within 48 h was 0 · 94 (0 · 20), 0 · 94 (0 · 15) and 0 · 94 (0 · 17), and 0 · 92 (0 · 19), 0 · 90 (0 · 26) and 0 · 94 (0 · 15) for single maintenance and reliever therapy and Standard regimens, respectively.

Twenty-two patients (11 men and 11 women) completed 12 weeks of study; they inhaled 200 micrograms salbutamol followed either immediately or after a timed interval by 100 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate two to four times daily. Morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates, symptom scores, additional <b>beta-agonist</b> inhaler usage, and subjective responses on a visual-analogue scale were recorded throughout. Results from the two last four-week periods, with and without the interval between drugs, were analysed. No differences were found.

40|$|Immunosensor {{surfaces}} for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) {{have been}} constructed using a functionalized succinimidyl propanethiol monolayer as a linker to immobilize <b>beta-agonist</b> protein conjugates on a Au surface. Because <b>beta-agonist</b> is a small molecule, an indirect competitive inhibition immunoassay was used for detection. The lowest detection limits for ractopamine and salbutamol were 10 ppt (10 pg mL(- 1)) and 5 ppt (5 pg mL(- 1)), respectively. The fabricated immunosensor surface can be used again for detection after regeneration in 0. 1 M sodium hydroxide. It {{was found that the}} same sensor surface could be reused for performing over 100 rapid immunoreactions. Moreover, one immunosensing-regeneration cycle requires only 600 s. The fabricated immunosensor surfaces were characterized using SPR and scanning tunneling microscopy observation. In the kinetic study of the indirect competitive immunosensing inhibition, the affinity constant (K- 1) of salbutamol antibody was smaller than the K 1 of ractopamine antibody. Compared to a previous study of clenbuterol detection, it was concluded that the high K- 1 was coupled with low sensitivity. In the selectivity study, both immunosensor surfaces provided > 90 % of confidence level for the specific detection of <b>beta-agonist</b> compounds.

40|$|GDP binding, proton {{conductance}} and {{the specific}} concentration of uncoupling protein were measured in brown-adipose-tissue mitochondria of rats treated acutely with the novel <b>beta-agonist,</b> BRL 26830 A.

An iterative analysis of Scatchard binding data suggested that there is only one high-affinity GDP-binding site (Kd 0. 3 microM) in brown-adipose-tissue mitochondria. The acute increase in GDP binding produced by treatment with BRL 26830 A occurred without any alteration in the specific mitochondrial concentration of uncoupling protein, as determined by radioimmunoassay. Treatment with the <b>beta-agonist</b> did, however, lead to a small increase in the GDP-sensitive component of mitochondrial proton conductance.

50|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease can coexist with asthma and can {{occur as a}} complication of chronic asthma. After the age of 65, most people with obstructive airway disease will have asthma and COPD. In this setting, COPD can be differentiated by increased airway neutrophils, abnormally increased wall thickness, and increased smooth muscle in the bronchi. However, this level of investigation is not performed due to COPD and asthma sharing similar principles of management: corticosteroids, long-acting <b>beta-agonists,</b> and smoking cessation. It closely resembles asthma in symptoms, is correlated with more exposure to cigarette smoke, an older age, less symptom reversibility after bronchodilator administration, and decreased likelihood of family history of atopy.|$|E
40|$|SummaryRationaleChronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is a complex}} and heterogeneous disorder in which {{a number of different}} pathological processes lead to recognition of patient subgroups that may have individual characteristics and distinct responses to treatment. ObjectivesWe tested the hypothesis that responses of lung function to 3 months of combined inhalation of long-acting <b>beta-agonist</b> and corticosteroid might differ among patients with various COPD subtypes. MethodsWe classified 165 COPD patients into four subtypes according to the severity of emphysema and airflow obstruction: emphysema-dominant, obstruction-dominant, mild-mixed, and severe-mixed. The emphysema-dominant subtype was defined by an emphysema index on computed tomography of more than 20 % and FEV 1 more than 45 % of the predicted value. The obstruction-dominant subtype had an emphysema index≤ 20 % and FEV 1 ≤ 45 %, the mild-mixed subtype had an emphysema index≤ 20 % and FEV 1 > 45 %, and the severe-mixed subtype had an emphysema index> 20 % and FEV 1 ≤ 45 %. Patients were recruited prospectively and treated with 3 months of combined inhalation of long-acting <b>beta-agonist</b> and corticosteroid. ResultsAfter 3 months of combined inhalation of long-acting <b>beta-agonist</b> and corticosteroid, obstruction-dominant subtype patients showed a greater FEV 1 increase and more marked dyspnea improvement than did the emphysema-dominant subgroup. The mixed-subtype patients (both subgroups) also showed significant improvement in FEV 1 compared with the emphysema-dominant subgroup. Emphysema-dominant subtype patients showed no improvement in FEV 1 or dyspnea after the 3 -month treatment period.

40|$|To the Editor: I {{read with}} {{interest}} the special supplement of Chest containing a symposium titled, “International scope of asthma ” (1986; 90 : 395 - 845). I {{would like to add}} to this information on the treatment of asthma in a developing African country, which was not tackled in this detailed publication. Treatment ofasthma in developing African countries (Table 1) and indeed in other third world countries is influenced by: the price and availability of drugs; customs and cultural beliefs; and the seasonal and diurnal variation in the frequency and severity of asthmatic attacks. In Zambia, for instance, inhaled <b>beta-agonist</b> and steroid drugs, cromoglycate, anticholinergic and allergenic extracts for immuno-therapy are very scarce, especially in rural health centers. When inhalation devices are available, patients are afraid to use them because they think they cause sudden death, and of those who use them only 70 percent do so correctly. Aminophyllmne suppositories are also unacceptable to the majority ofpatients, especially women; some of the patients feel they cause diarrhea or hemorrhoids. Asthmatic attacks in tropical and sub-tropical Africa occur most often during the hot, humid and rainy season (December through March) and usually at night. For this reason most patients who do not improve after initial parental ammnophyllmne therapy receive parental steroids, and many patients need oral steroid maintenance therapy during this period. Ketotifen-with either oral theophyllmne, oral <b>beta-agonist</b> or inhaled <b>beta-agonist</b> drugs-is often used to decrease the frequency and severity ofnocturnal asthma. This drug is also useful in asthmatic subjects with allergic rhinitis, and in treating analgesic-induced asthma (AlA). Like physicians elsewhere, we recommend either oral/inhaled <b>beta-agonist</b> or inhaled cromoglycate therapy to prevent exercise-induced asthma; unlike our Japanese counterparts, we have littl...|$|R
