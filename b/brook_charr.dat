40|$|Size-selective {{mortality}} {{caused by}} fishing can impose strong selection on harvested fish populations, causing evolution in important life-history traits. Understanding and predicting harvest-induced evolutionary change can help maintain sustainable fisheries. We investigate the evolutionary sustainability of alternative management regimes for lacustrine <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> (Salvelinus fontinalis) fisheries in southern Canada and aim to optimize these regimes {{with respect to}} the competing objectives of maximizing mean annual yield and minimizing evolutionary change in maturation schedules. Using a stochastic simulation model of <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> populations consuming a dynamic resource, we investigate how harvesting affects <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> maturation schedules. We show that when approximately 5 % to 15 % of the <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> biomass is harvested, yields are high, and harvest- induced evolutionary changes remain small. Intensive harvesting (at approximately > 15 % of <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> biomass) results in high average yields and little evolutionary change only when harvesting is restricted to <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> larger than the size at 50 % maturation probability at the age of 2 years. Otherwise, intensive harvesting lowers average yield and causes evolutionary change in the maturation schedule of <b>brook</b> <b>charr.</b> Our results indicate that intermediate harvesting efforts offer a acceptable compromise between avoiding harvest-induced evolutionary change and securing high average yields...|$|E

We observed that the mean length of the most posterior caecum of charr was significantly greater in sympatry than in allopatry (8 f 1 SD: 9. 91 + 1. 12 mm versus 8. 44 f 0. 67 mm). This is equivalent to an increase of 18 % of total pyloric caecal mass (dry weight) in sympatric <b>brook</b> <b>charr.</b> These results indicate that this response to differences in diet, well known in birds, also occurs in fish.

40|$|Abstract. The {{demand for}} {{and costs of}} {{producing}} land-based animal protein continues to escalate as the world population increases. Fish is an excellent protein, but the catch-fishery is stagnant or in decline. Intensive cage culture of fish is a viable option especially in countries with lakes/rivers and/or a long coast-line; however, disease outbreaks will likely occur more frequently with cage culture. Hence protective strate-gies are needed, and one approach is to exploit the piscine immune system. This discussion highlights immunity (innate/natural and adaptive/acquired) in fish against three pathogenic protozoa (Amyloodinium ocellatum, Ichthyophthirius multifiliis and Cryptobia salmositica). Histone-like proteins in the mucus and skin of naturally resistant fish kill trophonts of A. ocellatum, and also may cause abnormal development of tomonts. Breeding of Cryptobia-resistant <b>brook</b> <b>charrs</b> is possible as resistance is controlled by a dominant Mendelian locus, and the parasite is lysed via the Alternative Pathway of Complement Activation. Production of transgenic Cryptobia-tolerant salmon is an option. Recovered fish are protected from the three diseases (acquired immunity). Live I. multifiliis theronts injected intraperitoneally into fish elicit protection. Also, a recombinant immoblizing-antigen vaccine against ichthyophthirosis has been developed but further evalu-ations are necessary. The live Cryptobia vaccine protects salmonids from infections while the DNA-vaccine stimulates production of antibodies to neutralize the disease causing factor (metalloprotease) in cryptobio...|$|R
40|$|Morphological {{integration}} {{can respond}} to environmental conditions, a response that may be dynamic through ontogeny. Among fishes, <b>brook</b> <b>charrs</b> (Salvelinus fontinalis) display a trophic polymorphism {{that makes it a}} good species for analyzing the ontogeny of morphological integration. To better understand the processes regulating variation and integration, we assess the ontogenetic dynamics of covariances and developmental progress for populations of S. fontinalis from two habitats that differ in water velocity; lake and stream. Geometric morphometrics and developmental progress were evaluated on 751 and 198 specimens, respectively. In both habitats, most ossification events occur before the transition from alevin to juvenile. This threshold defines two distinct periods. During the first period representing free-embryos and alevins, there are important shape changes and rapid ossification, integration tends to be relatively low and decreasing and the variance of shape drastically decreases. During the juvenile period, the rate of shape change decreases and the onset of ossification is nearly complete, plus integration increases and shape variance stabilizes. While we find two distinct developmental periods, we nonetheless find a notable stability underlying the ontogenetic dynamics of variability as well as gradual change in the structure of covariation within each habitat. Our results imply that the variability of juvenile body shape does not seem to retain signals of variability determined early in ontogeny and warrants caution in using juvenile as guides to the earlier causes of variability. Overall, this study highlights the difficulty of inferring causes of integration from studies of static covariance...|$|R

Here we assessed the microsatellite genetic diversity {{and structure of}} three salmonid species, two native (Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus and brown trout, Salmo trutta) and one introduced (<b>brook</b> <b>charr,</b> Salvelinus fontinalis), from an alpine lake in sub-arctic Sweden, Lake Ann. The genetic diversity of the three species was similar and sufficiently high from a conservation genetics perspective: corrected total heterozygosity, H'(T) = 0. 54, 0. 66, 0. 60 and allelic richness, A(R) = 4. 93, 5. 53 and 5. 26 for Arctic charr, brown trout and <b>brook</b> <b>charr,</b> respectively. There were indications of elevated inbreeding coefficients in brown trout (G(IS) = 0. 144) and <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> (G(IS) = 0. 129) although sibling relationships were likely a confounding factor, as {{a high proportion of}} siblings were observed in all species within and among sampling locations. Overall genetic structure differed between species, Fst = 0. 01, 0. 02 and 0. 04 in Arctic charr, brown trout and <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> respectively, and there was differentiation at only a few specific locations. There was clear evidence of hybridisation between the native Arctic charr and the introduced <b>brook</b> <b>charr,</b> with 6 % of individuals being hybrids, all of which were sampled in tributary streams.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of ichthyofauna on {{the territory of}} the Jizera Mountains (Northern Bohemia, Czech Republic) is limited, besides other factors, by the water chemistry. pH value and pH-related concentration of inorganic monomeric aluminum (Ali) are crucial parameters of the water, determining the survival of fish in streams. Low pH and high concentrations of Ali cause severe damages to fish gills. The thesis deals with the influence of the water chemistry on distribution of ichthyofauna in the Jizera Mts and gill morphology in <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> (Salvelinus fontinalis), a dominant fish species of the upper plateau of the mountains.

40|$|Habitat {{condition}}s, use and preference, size-at-age, {{density and}} condition were assessed for headwater <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> (Salvelinus fontinalis) populations in streams in Southern Ontario where water extraction was occurring. Research {{was divided into}} two separate, but related studies, conducted {{during the summer and}} fall of 2002 and 2004. The first study sought to document the habitat conditions that influence size-at-age and density of age- 0 <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> and to test the hypotheses that: [1] differences in fork-lengths among sites were principally influenced by differences in stream thermal regimes as measured by accumulated thermal units (ATUs), with differences in stream physical characteristics (e. g., water quality, morphology, riparian vegetation) also having significant effects; [2] among-stream differences in flow regimes would significantly influence among-stream differences in age- 0 densities, with increases in flow being positively correlated with density; and, [3] length and density would be negatively correlated. Results indicated that differences in temperature, stream site and flow influenced differences in age- 0 length and density of <b>brook</b> <b>charr.</b> The effect of temperature, as measured by accumulated thermal units, dominated other influences, providing strong support for the null hypothesis [1] that size differences among sites were primarily driven by differences in the prevailing thermal regime. Some evidence was found to suggest that differences in stream physical characteristics influenced fish size and density, with stream flow affecting both to a moderate degree. Thus while study results provide support for the hypothesis [2] concerning flow-related impacts on age- 0 <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> in headwater streams, changes in flow cannot be considered of prime importance over the range of stream discharge differences (14. 3 - 28. 5 L•s - 1) observed here. Finally, there was no support for hypothesis [3] concerning the negative correlation between age- 0 fork-length and density. The second study investigated the effects of municipal groundwater pumping on stream habitat and the resident <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> population of Monora Creek, Orangeville, Ontario. Specifically, the study aimed to test the hypotheses that: [1] well-related water extraction was associated with habitat degradation at sites proximate to the extraction point; and, [2] degraded habitat was associated with reduced juvenile and adult <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> use and preference, reduced occupancy density and reduced condition. Study results indicated significant, although subtle, changes in available habitat as a result of pumping activity, with habitats in areas impacted by groundwater pumping showing significant decreases in hydraulic gradient, stream depth and the availability of under-cut bank and run and pool habitat. Combined, the changes in habitat influenced use, with age- 0 densities declining in stream reaches impacted by pumping relative to reaches of the stream not impacted by pumping. When adjusting for the relative availability of groundwater extraction on affected and non-affected habitat, standardized habitat preference indices indicated a significant preference for non-affected stream reaches among age- 0 <b>brook</b> <b>charr.</b> Adults evidenced only slight changes in distribution among the available habitats that were seasonally dependent, with reduced densities observed in affected habitats and increased densities in non-affected habitats noted only in the fall. Changes in <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> condition (weight-length relationship) and mortality were generally not in evidence {{during the course of this}} study. Combined, these studies suggest development actions moderating either the thermal or flow regime of streams will have negative effects on population status. Water extraction risks altering habitat in unfavourable ways by interrupting important linkages between flow and temperature that favour growth and density, but that prevent critical physiological thresholds for temperature from being surpassed. Furthermore, the impacts on <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> populations subjected to moderating pumping appear to relate more to patterns of within stream distribution and habitat use than to any direct measures of fitness such as survival or growth. The latter result suggests monitoring abundance and/or condition alone will not suffice to provide early warning of population stress responses to water extraction activities. 1 yea...|$|E
40|$|Brown trout were {{introduced}} to Newfoundland in the late 1800 s and are now established in watersheds on the Avalon, Burin and Bonavista peninsulas. Little is known about estuary use by brown trout outside of their native or their impacts to native Atlantic salmon and <b>brook</b> <b>charr.</b> A relatively pristine watershed in eastern Newfoundland was chosen to investigate seasonal use of estuary habitat by these three species, and to investigated if I) the incidence of anadromy in each species, 2) the quality of offspring of anadromous and resident, and 3) if the waterfalls are barriers to migration. A fourth objective was to test if a laser ablation "drilling" technique can successfully extract growth history information from otoliths. Abundance of adult brown trout was relatively consistent throughout the year, but capture of adult Atlantic salmon was limited to August (28 : 1 brown trout to salmon caught). Abundance of parr and smolt was greater in spring and summer, a pattern consistent between species, {{with the exception of}} a large pulse of salmon smolt during one day. Atlantic salmon and brown trout young of year were largely offspring of anadromous females, while <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> young of year were largely offspring of resident females. <b>Brook</b> <b>charr</b> were bigger than Atlantic salmon at post emergence midstream, upstream and end of growing season upstream. Brown trout were bigger than Atlantic salmon at post emergence midstream, while the opposite was found at end of growing season downstream.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine: (1) if morphological characters of littoral and pelagic <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> are inherited by their progeny when both forms are raised in the same conditions; (2) if sexual dimorphism would account for part of the variation in littoral and pelagic <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> morphology; (3) the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to trophic polymorphism of brook charr; and (4) if a fish that had already performed one plastic response can reverse this response in a functional direction when shifted to an alternative habitat (e. g. littoral to pelagic). We conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment over 16 months after hatching in which fish of both ecotypes were fed in artificial pelagic (prey captured in the water column) and littoral (prey captured on the bottom) habitats. The results show that morphological differences between littoral and pelagic <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> are heritable and related to both genetic and environmental factors. The percent variation of fish morphology explained by the effects of genetic and environmental factors was 17 % and 15 % respectively when the effect of sex was controlled, and 13 % and 26 % respectively when the effect of sex was not accounted for, indicating that sexual dimorphism accounts for {{an important part of the}} overall variation in <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> morphology. The shift of some individuals from their initial to the opposite habitat from months 12 – 16 highlighted the role of the genetic and environmental factors as well as the magnitude of morphological plasticity: some characters remained unchanged during this 4 -month shift, while some others exhibited a complete reversal, in line with the predictions of functional morphology. This result indicates that some characters are under pure environmental control and are not fixed after a fish has adopted a given strategy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Salmonids are {{regarded}} as 4 R derivative species, having experienced 4 whole genome duplication events in their ancestry. Many duplicated chromosome regions still share extensive homology with one another which is maintained primarily through male-based homeologous chromosome pairings during meiosis. The formation of quadrivalents during meiosis leads to pseudolinkage. This phenomenon is more prevalent within 5 of the 12 ancestral teleost linkage groups in salmonids. Results We constructed a genetic linkage map for <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> and used this {{in combination with the}} genetic map from Arctic charr, to make comparisons with the genetic map of rainbow trout. Although not all chromosome arms are currently mapped, some homologous chromosome rearrangements were evident between Arctic charr and <b>brook</b> <b>charr.</b> Notably, 10 chromosome arms in <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> representing 5 metacentric chromosomes in Arctic charr have undergone rearrangements. Three metacentrics have one arm translocated and fused with another chromosome arm in <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> to a make a new metacentrics while two metacentrics are represented by 4 acrocentric pairs in <b>brook</b> <b>charr.</b> In two cases (i. e., BC- 4 and BC- 16), an apparent polymorphism was observed with the identification of both a putative metacentric structure (similar to metacentric AC- 4 = BC- 4 and a joining of acrocentric AC- 16 + one arm of AC- 28 = BC- 16), as well as two separate acrocentric linkage groups evident in the mapping parents. Forty-six of the expected 50 karyotypic arms could be inter-generically assigned. SEX in <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> (BC- 4) was localized to the same homologous linkage group region as in Arctic charr (AC- 4). The homeologous affinities detected in the two charr species facilitated the identification of 20 (expected number = 25) shared syntenic regions with rainbow trout, although it is likely that some of these regions were partial or overlapping arm regions. Conclusions Inter-generic comparisons among 2 species of charr (genus Salvelinus) and a trout (genus Oncorhynchus) have identified that linkage group arm arrangements are largely retained among these species. Previous studies have revealed that up to 7 regions of high duplicate marker retention occur between Salmo species (i. e., Atlantic salmon and brown trout) and rainbow trout, with 5 of these regions exhibiting higher levels of pseudolinkage. Pseudolinkage was detected in the charr species (i. e., BC- 1 / 21, AC- 12 / 27, AC- 6 / 23, = RT- 2 p/ 29 q, RT- 12 p/ 16 p, and RT- 27 p/ 31 p, respectively) consistent with three of the five 'salmonid-specific' pseudolinkage regions. Chromosome arms with the highest number of duplicated markers in rainbow trout are the linkage group arms with the highest retention of duplicated markers in both charr species. </p...|$|E
40|$|Charr (Salvelinus spp.) {{exhibit a}} variety of {{migration}} strategies, whereby some individuals venture to sea (anadromous) while others spend the entirety {{of their lives in}} freshwater (residents). The anadromous individuals are of particular interest as their behaviours may shape life history and affect population dynamics through increased exposure to fishery exploitation. Here, I explore the migratory behaviour at sea of <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> (S. fontinalis) from two distinct populations in Gros Morne National Park (GMNP), Newfoundland; one where the river enters a protected fjord and the other, open ocean. An interdisciplinary approach is used, integrating acoustic telemetry, otolith microchemistry, and fishermen surveys to quantify and contrast migratory behaviours, and to characterize the recreational fishery. Acoustic telemetry of 17 <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> from one population (in the Bonne Bay fjord), and otolith microchemistry from two populations (Bonne Bay fjord, where N= 23, and Western Brook, where N= 82) show age and habitat specific movements of <b>brook</b> <b>charr.</b> <b>Brook</b> <b>charr</b> make their first seaward migration at age 2 +, often with previous movements to brackish environment between ages 1 - 2. At sea, charr frequent areas close to river mouths during {{the beginning and end of}} migratory period, venturing further away during the mid period of their marine residency. Results indicate that estuarine habitat may be important to anadromous individuals. After first seaward migration at 2 +, there was no significant age-specific pattern for subsequent migrations. Fishermen surveys from two charr fisheries in western Newfoundland (the <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> fishery of GMNP, and the Arctic charr [S. alpinus]) fishery of Pistolet Bay) provided some evidence that sea-run charr are at increased risk of fisheries interactions. Surveys revealed the usefulness of fishermen’s knowledge to managers, especially to rural communities where local fishermen are the primary resource user and have historical knowledge of the fishery. In both cases, fishermen identified decreases in stock health, but where fishermen were more engaged, in Pistolet Bay, resource users supported increased management efforts to improve stock health. By comparing the GMNP fishery with the Pistolet Bay fishery, I emphasized the effectiveness of fishermen engagement in management regimes and highlight opportunities for comanagement in recreational fisheries to protect stock health where necessary. My results provide insight into the complexity of migratory strategies exhibited by charr species and the opportunities in management of charr recreational fisheries...|$|E
40|$|English: Urbanization is {{a serious}} threat to stream ecosystems. Culverts {{fragment}} habitats, and can function as migration barriers. If migratory individuals are prevented to move between important habitats, this could potentially result in spatial variation in lifehistory traits. <b>Brook</b> <b>charr</b> (Salvelinus fontinalis) is an introduced salmonid species of North- American origin. It has shown to be mobile within systems, and its life history patterns to be phenotypic plastic. Despite being an unwanted species in the Norwegian fauna, it has received little attention as it has been considered to be a competition-weak species. In this study I tested the hypothesis that; a the degree of local-scale connectivity, including both natural- and man-made barriers, influences migration probability, and bowing to local-scale influence on within- stream section environmental conditions there are among-section differences in <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> life history traits like growth, survival, and maturation. The hypothesis was tested in Oslo’s most urban stream, Hovinbekken. The study stream was divided into four spatially separated sections, where individuals of <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> were caught using electroshocking, tagged with PIT-tags, and recaptured, during an eighteen months period (2010 - 2012). Over five sampling occasions, in total 528 <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> individuals were caught, of which 452 were tagged. Out of 143 recaptured individuals, 8 moved between stations. 6 of them moved between the two stations without natural or man-made barriers, a pattern attributed to spawning and winter-migration. 2 individuals moved in a downstream direction through culverts, none the opposite way. Upstream migration through natural and artificial fragmented landscape seems therefore to be absent, probably impossible. Growth, survival, and length at maturation varied at a temporal and spatial scale; the southernmost and most urban stations had highest growth rate for 0 +, longer growth before stagnation, and matured at longer lengths, probably due to favorable temperature conditions. Survival probability seemed in general to be lowest over winter. Additionally, winter survival was size-dependent, i. e. larger fish having the highest survival. In contrast, and over summer, survival was negatively sizedependent. Spatial variation in size-dependent seasonal survival was found, and attributed to pool characteristics. Because of the inconsistence in size-independent spatial variation in survival, and the impossibility to determine age at sexual maturation, {{further research is needed to}} gain more knowledge of brook charrs life history traits in Hovinbekken. I also recommend continuing studying <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> in Hovinbekken to obtain further knowledge for best management practice...|$|E

Throughout {{the length of the}} flow, twelve catching sites were identified there, the length of each site was about 50 m, the catch in these sites was {{from the bottom of the}} upstream towards the end. The catch of the flow was by wade manner with use of an electric aggregate. All caught fish species were subsequently determined. Also the body lenght so-called ?standart lenght? was measured. After measuring all fish that were caught were gently given back to the place of the catch. In terms of abundance the most numerous species in Popelka was brown trout represented by 477 subjects followed by stone loach with 391 subjects. These species clearly dominated in Popelka. Another occurring species were rainbow trout with 49 subjects, <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> with two subjects and hybrid of brown trout and <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> with one subject. With regard to the regional constance the brown trout was a species almost always present, with presence in 11 out of the 12 sites.

Among the species that are rare in Popelka, there were <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> occurring in two locations and hybrid of brown trout and <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> with the appearance in one location. Index of species diversity by Shannon and Wiener for the flow of Popelka is 0. 88 and evenness is 0. 55.

40|$|A {{linkage map}} of 40 linkage groups (LGs) was {{developed}} for <b>brook</b> <b>charr,</b> Salvelinus fontinalis, using an F 2 interstrain hybrid progeny (n = 171) and 256 coding gene SNP developed specifically for <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> and validated from a large (> 1000) subset of putative SNP, as well as 81 microsatellite markers. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to reproduction functions, these fish were also phenotyped at six physiological traits, including spermatozoid head diameter, sperm concentration, plasma testosterone, plasma 11 -keto-testosterone, egg diameter, and plasma 17 β-estradiol. Five significant QTL were detected over four LGs for egg diameter and plasma 17 β-estradiol concentration in females, and sperm concentration as well as spermatozoid head diameter in males. In females, two different QTLs located on LG 11 and LG 34 {{were associated with the}} egg number, whereas one QTL was associated with plasma 17 β-estradiol concentration (LG 8). Their total percent variance explained (PVE) was 26. 7 % and 27. 6 %, respectively. In males, two QTL were also detected for the sperm concentration, and their PVE were estimated at 18. 58 % and 14. 95 %, respectively. The low QTL number, associated with the high PVE, suggests that the variance in these reproductive physiological traits was either under the control of one major gene or a small number of genes. The QTL associated with sperm concentration, plasma 17 β-estradiol, and egg diameter appeared to be under a dominance effect, whereas the two others were under a negative additive effect. These results show that genes underlying the phenotypic variance of these traits are under different modes of action (additive vs. dominance) and may be used to predict an increase or a decrease in their phenotypic values in subsequent generations of selective breeding.

Charr from acidic lakes had fewer yolky oocytes and more oil droplet oocytes than those from neutral lakes in July and August. However, oocyte development was accelerated from September onwards and the abundance of all oocyte stages was the same in charr from acidic and neutral lakes by October. Charr from the acidic lakes produced significantly more mature ova than charr from neutral lakes, but the average weight and diameter of the ova were decreased. Plasma estrogen and vitellogenin levels did not differ among charr from acidic and neutral lakes. Male <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> from neutral lakes initiated rapid spermatogenesis in June, as measured by the increase in spermatocyte and spermatozoa cyst diameter and percent of testis area. Charr from acidic lakes initiated rapid spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis in July, one month later than charr from the neutral lakes. The rate of spermatogenesis increased in charr from acidic lakes in September, so by October, the quantity of spermatozoa in their testes was the same as in charr from neutral lakes. Histological evidence indicates that charr from acidic lakes did not spawn in October and November, as did those in neutral lakes. Spawning activity was observed in the neutral lakes by mid-October, but spawning still had not occurred by mid-November in the acidic lakes.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Despite their dual {{importance}} {{in the assessment of}} endangered/threatened species, there have been few attempts to integrate traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and evolutionary biology knowledge (EBK) at the population level. We contrasted long-term aboriginal TEK with previously obtained EBK in the context of seasonal migratory habits and population biology of a salmonid fish, <b>brook</b> <b>charr,</b> (Salvelinus fontinalis) inhabiting a large, remote postglacial lake. Compilation of TEK spanning four decades involved analytical workshops, semidirective interviews, and collaborative fieldwork with local aboriginal informants and fishing guides. We found that TEK complemented EBK of <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> by providing concordant and additional information about (1) population viability; (2) breeding areas and migration patterns of divergent populations; and (3) the behavioral ecology of populations within feeding areas; all of which may ultimately affect the maintenance of population diversity. Aboriginal concerns related to human pressures on this species, not revealed by EBK, also help to focus future conservation initiatives for divergent populations and to encourage restoration of traditional fishing practices. However, relative to EBK, the relevance of TEK to salmonid biodiversity conservation was evident mainly at a smaller spatial scale, for example, that of individual rivers occupied by populations or certain lake sectors. Nevertheless, EBK was only collected over a 4 -yr period, so TEK provided an essential long-term temporal window t...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{synthesized}} {{the results}} of a coordi-nated study examining the spatial and temporal movements, genetic structure, and physiological characteristics of sympatric populations of resident and sea-run <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> across eastern Canada. Our goal was to critically evaluate three working hypotheses that may explain anadromous behaviour in brook charr: (1) resident and anadromous forms have different phylogenic origins; (2) anadromy emerges from freshwater residents; and (3) freshwater resi-dency emerges from anadromous individuals. Our synthesis is consistent with the conclusion that freshwater residency emerging from anadromous individuals is most probable. Overall, anadromy in <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> is poorly developed and the tactic of sea-running may be described as partial, facultative anadromy if the species must be described in terms of anadromy. The sea-run tactic most probably results from the species ’ propensity to move and disperse, the over-production of juveniles, an archetypical physiological ability to tolerate saline environments, and the persistence of critical habitats. When the spatial and temporal physical environments permit, the anadromous behaviour is expressed. The tactic creates an apparent fitness advantages related to growth, but it is not necessarily the only evolutionary stable strategy for a river. Most populations with sea-run forms are declining and successful conservation of sea-run forms will depend on managing harvests and more importantly, protection of the temporally and spatially complexity of critical habitats...|$|E

The rates at which {{patterns of}} diversity respond to changes in demographic properties and approach equilibrium are therefore pivotal {{in our understanding of}} spatial patterns of diversity. The <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> Salvelinus fontinalis is a coastal fish exhibiting limited marine movements, such that a stable one-dimensional isolation-by-distance (IBD) pattern should be observed over the whole range. Its range, however, recently shifted northward such that northern populations may still be in the process of reaching equilibrium. We investigated variation in IBD patterns, genetic divergence, and allelic richness at six microsatellite markers in 2087 anadromous <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> from 59 rivers along the most likely postglacial colonization route. We observed a decrease in allelic richness, together with an increase in differentiation and a decrease in IBD in the most recently colonized northern populations, as expected following recent colonization. Contrary to expectation, however, similar patterns were also observed at the southernmost part of the range, despite the fact that these populations are not considered to be newly colonized. We propose that the loss of dispersal capabilities associated with anadromy may have caused the southernmost populations to evolve relatively independently of one another. This study thus demonstrated that changes in a species' geographic range and dispersal capabilities may contribute to shaping geographic patterns of genetic diversity...|$|E

During the year 2008, physical and chemical parameters of the water were studied, the species and age composition of ichthyofauna, and the quality and quantity of macrozoobenthos - the main component of the food for fish. Special attention was paid to the content of toxic metals (Be, Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Pb, Hg) in the water, main representatives of benthic organisms, and in selected tissues of <b>brook</b> <b>charr.</b> The comparison of the water chemistry with results from the years 1994, 1996, and 1997 showed a decrease in acidification, despite the unstable chemical climate during the seasons, and sulphate and nitrate concentrations still high.

40|$|Growth {{performance}} and reduced stress response are traits of major interest in fish production. Growth and stress-related quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been already identified in several salmonid species, but little {{effort has been}} devoted to charrs (genus Salvelinus). Moreover, most QTL studies to date focused on one or very few traits, and little investigation {{has been devoted to}} QTL identification for gene expression. Here, our objective was to identify QTL for 27 phenotypes related to growth and stress responses in <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> (Salvelinus fontinalis), {{which is one of the}} most economically important freshwater aquaculture species in Canada. Phenotypes included 12 growth parameters, six blood and plasma variables, three hepatic variables, and one plasma hormone level as well as the relative expression measurements of five genes of interest linked to growth regulation. QTL analysis relied on a linkage map recently built from S. fontinalis consisting of both single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, n = 266) and microsatellite (n = 81) markers in an F 2 interstrain hybrid population (n = 171). We identified 63 growth-related QTL and four stress-related QTL across 18 of the 40 linkage groups of the <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> linkage map. Percent variance explained, confidence interval, and allelic QTL effects also were investigated to provide insight into the genetic architecture of growth- and stress-related QTL. QTL related to growth {{performance and}} stress response that were identified could be classified into two groups: (1) a group composed of the numerous, small-effect QTL associated with some traits related to growth (i. e., weight) that may be under the control of a large number of genes or pleiotropic genes, and (2) a group of less numerous QTL associated with growth (i. e., gene expression) and with stress-related QTL that display a larger effect, suggesting that these QTL are under the control of a limited number of genes of major effect. This study represents a first step toward the identification of genes potentially linked to phenotypic variation of growth and stress response in <b>brook</b> <b>charr.</b> The ultimate goal is to provide new tools for developing Molecular Assisted Selection for this species...|$|E
40|$|Fish {{growth is}} {{important}} for fisheries management and aquaculture. The growth pattern of fish is a complex process which is influenced by environmental factors, hormones and genetic composition. Thyroid hormones (THs) {{play an important role}} in regulating fish growth. The identification of TH-dependant genes in fish could provide valuable information for predicting growth. <b>Brook</b> <b>charr</b> is an important species in aquaculture and therefore represents a good model to study fish growth. The objectives of this study were: (1) to identify TH-regulated genes in <b>brook</b> <b>charr,</b> (2) to identify growth responsive genes in <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> and assess whether or not the expression of TH­ dependent genes are altered in fast and slow growing fish using a genomics approach. To identify TH-dependant genes, three experimental groups of immature charr were used: a euthyroid control group (n=lO), a hyperthyroid group (n=lO) in which <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> were injected (i. p.) with 3, 5, 3 '-triiodo-L-thyronine (T 3; 10 ug/kg body weight), and a hypothyroid group (n=lO) in which fish were injected with sodium ipodate (50 mg/kg body weight) a TH inhibitor. Fish were injected on days 1 and 4 of the experiment and sampled on day 7. Serum T 3 levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Results indicate that serum T 3 concentrations decreased from 2. 20 ng/ml in controls to 0. 85 ng/ml in the ipodate treated group. T 3 levels in the hyperthyroid group were 263. 4 ng/ml. THs induced hepatic gene expression as measured by differentiai display PCR. The results show that over 100 transcripts were differentially regulated by THs. The expression of 18 of these genes was further confrrmed by reverse dot blot. These were then cloned and sequenced. Sequence homology comparisons revealed seven known genes: trypomyosin (3 isoforms), leukocyte-derived chemotaxin, mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5, basic transcription factor 3 and crystalline. Eleven genes had no significant homology to known gene and were therefore considered novel. Tissue distribution of the transcripts, as determined by Northem blot analysis, varied for each gene. While ali genes were expressed in liver, clearly the functions of these genes were not restricted to hepatic function as most of these were expressed in multiple tissues. Since THs are known to be important regulators of growth, we wanted to determine whether or not the expression of TH-dependent genes differed between animais exhibiting different growth rate. To characterize growth-dependent gene expression profiles, eDNA arrays (GRASP project, University of Victoria) containing 16, 000 genes were used. Two families of immature <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> that were known to exhibit different growth characteristics were compared. These fish bad been raised under similar rearing conditions from egg incubation to the time of sampling (April, 2003). One family bad fast growing fish (n= 8; average weight 54. 73 ± 12. 14 g) while the second bad slow growing fish (n= 8; average weight 8. 43 ± 1. 59 g). Total RNA isolated from livers of fast and slow growing fish were used to prepare eDNA probes. The eDNA probes were labeled and hybridized to the eDNA microarrays. Microarrays were scanned and analyzed using GeneSpring software according to MIAME standards. A total of 94 genes were found to be growth-dependent exhibiting at least a 2 -fold change in expression. There were 69 genes that were up-regulated and 25 genes were down-regulated in fast growing fish. Out of the 94 differentially expressed genes, 39 of these are known genes that have been implicated in regulating carbohydrate, fatty acid and protein metabolism, as weil as mitochondrial function and signaling pathways. Twenty of these have been shawn in the literature to be TH-dependent. The remaining 55 genes have unknown functions. Only two of the genes (basic transcription factors and leukocyte-derived chemotaxin) identified in the first experiment were present on the microarrays. However, the microarray results did not indicate different expression for these two between our fast and slow growing fish. These results indicate that TH-dependent genes may be associated with growth. In conclusion, we have identified 18 TH-dependent genes in <b>brook</b> <b>charr.</b> This bas allowed us to show that THs are implicated in a wide variety of physiological processes as indicated by their function and tissue expression pattern. The genomic analysis of hepatic gene expression in fast and slow growing fish revealed that 20 genes that are known to be TH-dependent and regulated by growth. This supports previous reports that THs may be involved in the regulation of growth...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} fishes possess damage-released {{chemical}} alarm signals, that {{play a critical}} role in the detection and avoidance of potential predation threats. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the ability of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) and finescale dace (Phoxinus neogaeus) to detect and respond to conspecific alarm signals is significantly reduced under weakly acidic conditions (pH 6. 0). Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> (Salvelinus fontinalis) possess an analogous alarm signaling system. It is unknown, however if the trout alarm signaling system is likewise affected by relatively small changes in pH. I conducted laboratory and field trials to examine the potential effects of acute exposure to weakly acidic (pH 6. 0) conditions on the detection and response of conspecific alarm signals by juvenile trout. My laboratory results demonstrate that while juvenile rainbow trout exhibit significant increases in antipredator behaviour under normal pH conditions (pH 7. 0 - 7. 2), they do not respond to the presence of conspecific chemical alarm signals (i. e. response is not different from controls) under weakly acidic conditions. Similarly, natural population of <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> failed to detect conspecific alarm cues in a weakly acidic stream (mean pH 6. 11) while they responded to these cues in a neutral stream (mean pH of 6. 88).

Here, we have investigated the <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> (Salvelinus fontinalis) responses to artificial selection by means of transcriptional analysis of ∼ 32, 000 cDNA features performed in both selected and control populations reared under identical environmental conditions during four generations. Our results indicate that selective breeding led to significant changes in the transcription of genes at the juvenile stage, where we observed 4. 16 % (156 / 3750) of differentially expressed genes between the two lines. No significant genes were revealed at the earlier life stage. Moreover, when comparing our results to those of previous studies on Atlantic salmon that compared lines that were selected for five to seven generations for similar traits (e. g., growth), genes with similar biological functions were found to be under selection in both studies. These observations indicate that (1) four generations of selection caused substantial changes in regulation of gene transcription between selected and control populations and (2) selective breeding for improving the same phenotypic traits (e. g., rapid growth) in <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> and Atlantic salmon tended to select for the same changes in transcription profiles as the expression of a small and similar set of genes was affected by selection...|$|E
40|$|Most salmonid taxa have an {{anadromous}} {{life history}} strategy, whereby fish migrate to saltwater habitats for a growth period {{before returning to}} freshwater habitats for spawning. Moreover, several species are characterized by different life history tactics whereby resident and anadromous forms may occur in genetically differentiated populations within a same species, as well as polymorphism within a population. The molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological differences between anadromous and resident forms during the first transition from freshwater to saltwater environments are only partially understood. Insofar research has typically focused on species of the genus Salmo. Here, using a 16, 000 cDNA array, we tested the hypothesis that anadromous <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> Salvelinus fontinalis are characterized by differences in their transcriptome relative to resident <b>brook</b> <b>charr</b> before the anadromous fish migration. Families originating from parapatric populations of anadromous and resident charr were reared in controlled environments mimicking natural temperature and photoperiod, and sampled in spring, while still in fresh water. While anadromous and resident charr showed similar transcriptome profiles in white muscle, they were characterized by striking differences in their gill transcriptome profiles. Genes that were upregulated in the gills of anadromous charr were principally involved in metabolism (mitochondrial electron transport chain, glucose metabolism, and protein synthesis), development (tissue differentiation) and innate immunity. We discuss {{the nature of these}} transcriptomic differences in relation to molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of anadromous and resident life history tactics and suggest that the anadromous charr express some of the molecular processes present in other migratory salmonids [Current Zoology 58 (1) : 158 – 170, 2012]...|$|E
