5|$|After {{witnessing}} California-based gang boss Eddie Kim brutally <b>beat</b> <b>U.S.</b> Prosecutor Daniel Hayes {{to death}} in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a Boeing 747-400 to testify in a trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes {{to be placed in}} the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without the need for provocation, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in a bathroom, and a man using another bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX.|$|E
25|$|My dad was not {{the monster}} my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never <b>beat</b> <b>us</b> black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name {{was the only way}} he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was {{the only way he could}} get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|E

[...] "Instead of laying down to us, Akron loaded up with catcher [...] Munson and pitcher Bob Spade", Hogan {{said in an interview}} with the Pittsburgh Press. [...] "They worked their heads off to down us, but could not do so". [...] Hogan went on to assert that the Akron club, and its manager, received generous incentives to defeat Youngstown. [...] "The Akron owner offered the players a bonus of $500 if they would <b>beat</b> <b>us</b> out in addition to a $300 wad for East", Hogan said. [...] Then, he accused East himself of attempting to [...] "fix" [...] a game during the 1906 season, claiming that the Akron manager had [...] "tried to get another club to take things easy against Akron so that Akron could <b>beat</b> <b>us</b> for the pennant".|$|E

500|$|The England Test was the All Blacks' third {{international}} {{in as many}} weeks; they had been played on successive Saturdays, with a mid-week match between each. England named eight new caps in their side, and played a rover (or wing-forward) on top of seven forwards. The game {{has been described as}} [...] "a benefit for All Black wing Duncan McGregor". He scored four tries in the Test—a record not equalled by an All Black until 1987. A try was also scored by Fred Newton, and with none of the five tries converted, the score finished 15–0. English sportsman C. B. Fry said after the match, [...] "The notion that these men <b>beat</b> <b>us</b> because of our physical degeneracy is nonsense. They <b>beat</b> <b>us</b> by organisation and by tactics." [...] A legacy of this match is that the whistle used by the referee, Gil Evans, has been used to start the opening match of every Rugby World Cup tournament. Between tournaments the whistle is housed at the New Zealand Rugby Museum in Palmerston North and was donated to them by the chairman of the NZRFU and manager of the 1924–25 All Blacks.|$|E
500|$|On 27 March 1784 he was {{appointed}} Master of the Rolls, a job to which he dedicated himself once he ceased {{to act as an}} MP. He had previously practised in the Court of Chancery, and although unfamiliar with Roman law was highly efficient; Lord Eldon said [...] "I am mistaken if, after I am gone, the Chancery Records do not prove that if I have decided more than any of my predecessors in the same period of time, Sir Lloyd Kenyon <b>beat</b> <b>us</b> all". On 9 June 1788, Kenyon succeeded Lord Mansfield as Lord Chief Justice, and was granted a barony. Although not rated as highly as his predecessor, his work [...] "restored the simplicity and rigor of the common law". He remained Lord Chief Justice until his death in 1802.|$|E
500|$|Having {{withdrawn}} from politics, Kenyon instead switched his focus {{to his job}} as Master of the Rolls. As a judge of the Court of Chancery he was required to deal with cases of equity; though he was almost entirely unfamiliar with the Roman law it was based on, he had previously practised in the Chancery. He was not considered {{as good as his}} successor, Sir William Grant, but Lord Eldon wrote that [...] "I am mistaken if, after I am gone, the Chancery Records do not prove that if I have decided more than any of my predecessors in the same period of time, Sir Lloyd Kenyon <b>beat</b> <b>us</b> all". With the retirement of Lord Mansfield as Lord Chief Justice, Kenyon succeeded him on 9 June 1788, and was made Baron Kenyon of Gredington, in the county of Flint.|$|E

500|$|The first-round {{series against}} the Magic was touted as the matchup {{between two of the}} league's best young big men in Bosh and Dwight Howard. Howard {{dominated}} throughout the series, while Bosh had a serires-best effort in Game 4 with 39 points and 15 rebounds. General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, [...] "Whether it's protecting [...] inside the paint, getting {{a little bit more of}} a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's clear we have to get better", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul. Bosh said after the loss, [...] "They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense better than we did and when it came to the small things, they did a better job... I can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win. That's pretty obvious. They <b>beat</b> <b>us</b> pretty good."

500|$|Levels were {{designed}} {{based on a}} Deluxe Paint interface, which allowed several of the members to design levels, resulting in [...] "hundreds of levels".

Beat that!', we'd calmly point out a totally new way of getting around all his traps, and {{doing it in a}} much simpler method. 'Oh...', he'd mutter, and scramble off to try and fix it." [...] They also sent internally tested levels to Psygnosis, getting back the results of their testing via fax. While most were solved quickly, Dailly commented that [...] "Every now and again though, the fax would be covered in scribbles with the time and comments crossed out again and again; this is what we were striving for while we were designing the levels, and it gave us all a warm fuzzy feeling inside." ...|$|E

[...] He accepted defeat and was optimistic Liverpool had the means to win the Premier League: [...] "We'd rather they <b>beat</b> <b>us</b> in this game and then we go on to pick up the title. That's what we're really looking at. Even though they got the better of us yesterday, it doesn't mean they'll do better than us over the whole season." [...] Diouf insisted he should have earned a penalty in the second half, given he felt there was [...] "definite contact" [...] from a challenge in the penalty box: [...] "It was a penalty, definitely, but the referee is the master on the pitch and he didn't give it. I know the Arsenal players think I dived, but I didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Coach McKay had {{won four}} {{national}} championships while coaching at USC, {{and he never}} hesitated to express his lack of awe at the NFL. He earned enemies in the league with his dismissive comments and nonchalant attitude. The league liked to promote the games as having life-or-death significance, and were undercut by a coach who would make statements such as, “You draw Xs and Os on a blackboard and that’s not so difficult. I can even do it with my left hand”. Such statements made the Buccaneers’ road more difficult, as a feeling grew around the league that McKay was a newcomer who needed to be taught a lesson. Linebacker Richard “Batman” Wood echoed those sentiments: “It was a brand-new organization. Who cared about us? They wanted to devastate us, <b>beat</b> <b>us</b> in the ground. And with coach McKay coming from college, they wanted to maybe even play us a little harder." [...] Examples given of opponents using McKay’s comments {{as an excuse to}} run up the score included the reverse that Denver ran late in a 48–10 victory, and the timeout that Chuck Fairbanks called {{at the end of the}} Patriots game to enable Steve Grogan to break the NFL record of season rushing touchdowns by a quarterback. One sports analyst had predicted that McKay’s lucrative contract would encourage opposing coaches to run up the score on the Buccaneers, to be able to demonstrate to their team owners that they were deserving of similar money.|$|E

At this time, Nixon sent his adviser, former Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania, on a fact finding trip to Europe to gather intelligence on Western alliance and Soviet issues. In response to Humphrey's calls for a face to face debate, Nixon remarked: [...] "Before we can have a debate between Nixon and Humphrey, Humphrey's got to settle his debate with himself." [...] Nixon campaigned in San Francisco, in front of 10,000 supporters amidst an array of protests. The candidate took on the protesters first hand, and delivered his [...] "forgotten American" [...] speech, declaring that election day would be [...] "a day of protest for the forgotten American," [...] a group which included those that [...] "obey the law, pay their taxes, go to church, send their children to school, love their country and demand new leadership." [...] By month's end, many in the Nixon campaign believed his election was guaranteed, beginning to prepare for the transition period, despite Nixon's warning that [...] "the one thing that can <b>beat</b> <b>us</b> now is overconfidence." [...] Gallup showed Nixon leading Humphrey 43% to 28% at the end of September.|$|E
500|$|As {{the season}} wore on, Philadelphia {{developed}} momentum as a wild-card contender. The Phillies dominated the Mets in head-to-head play, posting three separate series sweeps, including a pivotal sweep of a four-game series at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia during late August which included two walk-off hits by Chase Utley and Ryan Howard and comeback victories for the Phillies {{in three of}} the four games. During the season, Burrell also hit two home runs off Wagner, resulting in two blown saves. By the time Philadelphia swept the Mets at Shea Stadium in mid-September, the Phillies were threatening to move from wild-card contender to division leader. With 17 games left to play, the Mets led the Phillies by seven games; during that final stretch, the Mets won only five games and lost twelve, while the Phillies went 13–4. On {{the final day of the}} season, the Phillies won the division, backing up Rollins' quote. Mets starter Tom Glavine gave up seven runs in the first inning to the Florida Marlins, while the Phillies beat the Washington Nationals behind Eastern Pennsylvania native Jamie Moyer to win the division for the first time since 1993. Rollins capped his prediction by adding his first career Most Valuable Player award. According to Baseball Prospectus, the Mets' collapse over the end of the season ranked statistically as the second-worst in baseball history. After the 2007 season, Wagner also said that [...] " [...] collapse didn't come because the Phillies <b>beat</b> <b>us,</b> the collapse came because we played bad".|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to solve their problem in finding a {{reliable}} opening partnership in the series, England promoted Verity to open the batting in the fourth Test. After Australia were bowled out for 288, Verity and Barnett put on 53runs together, England's best opening partnership of the series. Wisden praised Verity's defence but {{said he had not}} solved the problem of finding a partner for Barnett. England scored 330 but Australia's second innings of 433 left England needing 392. Barnett and Verity began with a stand of 45, but England lost by 148 runs. In two innings, Verity scored 19 and 17, but was wicketless in the match. Having levelled the series, Australia won the final match by a large margin to take the series 3–2. Verity took just one wicket in the match. In the series, he took 10wickets at an average of 45.50; in all first-class matches in Australia, he captured 28wickets at 30.75 and secured 10wickets at 18.20 in two matches in New Zealand {{at the end of the}} tour. The Wisden report on the tour said: [...] "Verity admirably performed the task of keeping one end closed and took high honours for his consistently good work." [...] The Times correspondent, noting the failure of the wrist spinners selected to tour, wrote: [...] "Australia... <b>beat</b> <b>us</b> because they have spin bowlers who make the ball truly spin.

2500|$|The press duly {{built the}} series up as a must-see, but {{the players were}} far more reticent {{than they had been}} during the {{adjacent}} encounter three years before. [...] Early in December, however, Australian captain Ricky Ponting drew considerable criticism for his comments about the ICC's wines and spirits. [...] "It has taken us a long time and a lot of great wins in different conditions around the world to get us to that number-one spot", Ponting declared, speaking to the Associated Press. [...] "If South Africa <b>beat</b> <b>us</b> three-nil I don't know if that gives them enough points to get over us. [...] But if they won the series one-nil or two-one, I don't think that would mean that they deserve to take over that mantle. [...] It's a bit the same with India last series. [...] Just because they <b>beat</b> <b>us,</b> the number-one team, doesn't necessarily mean they go from the number four or number five in the world to number one in the world, because it's something that's accrued {{over a long period of}} time." [...] The remark was seen as fatalist and trivialising, suggesting that the rubber hardly mattered and, in the eyes of many, that Ponting's hopes of securing a series victory were low.|$|E
