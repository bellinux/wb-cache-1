2500|$|In 2015, Hanson {{claimed that}} Halal {{certification}} in Australia was funding terrorism. After the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Hanson {{called for a}} ban on Muslim immigration to Australia. The same year Hanson announced policies including a <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>building</b> new mosques until a royal commission into whether Islam is a religion or a political ideology has been held, and installing CCTV cameras in all existing mosques. She {{has called for a}} [...] "moratorium" [...] on accepting Muslim immigrants into Australia. In Pauline Hanson's 2016 maiden speech in the Senate, she said that [...] "We are in danger of being swamped by Muslims who bear a culture and ideology that is incompatible with our own" [...] and called for banning Muslim migration. The speech prompted a walk out by Senate members of the Australian Greens. After the 2017 Westminster attack she repeated her stance on banning Muslims from entering into Australia.|$|E
2500|$|The Roman Empire {{split in}} 390 CE {{and the region}} {{became part of the}} (Christian) East Roman Empire, known as the Byzantine Empire. Byzantine Christianity was {{dominated}} by the (Greek) Eastern Orthodox Church whose massive land ownership has extended into the present. In the 5th century, the Western Roman Empire collapsed leading to Christian migration into the Roman province of Palaestina Prima and development of a Christian majority. Jews numbered 10–15% of the population, concentrated largely in the Galilee. [...] Judaism was the only non-Christian religion tolerated, but restrictions on Jews slowly increased to include a <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>building</b> new places of worship, holding public office or owning slaves. In 425, following the death of the last Nasi, Gamliel VI, the Sanhedrin was officially abolished and the title of Nasi banned. Several Samaritan Revolts erupted in this period, resulting in the decrease of Samaritan community from about a million to a near extinction. Sacred Jewish texts written in Palestine at this time are the Gemara (400), the Jerusalem Talmud (500) and the Passover Haggadah.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, Allam {{published}} an article calling for a <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>building</b> mosques in Italy. In a piece accusing mosques of fostering hate, he claimed Italy is suffering from [...] "mosque-mania" [...] and justified the extreme measure of a government <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>building</b> mosques. Previously, he had voiced support for an economic involvement of the Italian government in building new mosques to satisfy {{the needs of a}} growing Muslim population.|$|E

50|$|Gielow {{served in}} the Wisconsin State Assembly 2003-2007. In 2010, Gielow was elected mayor of Mequon, Wisconsin and had served on the Mequon Common Council. As mayor of Mequon, Gielow began lifting some <b>bans</b> <b>on</b> <b>building</b> and changed some zoning laws to allow more {{commerce}} and thus, more business tax base, which in some cases was considered controversial. In the Wisconsin Spring Election April 2013, Gielow was defeated for reelection for Mayor of Mequon by Dan Abendroth.|$|R

5000|$|The ASI {{has written}} {{extensively}} about the effect the green belt has had on house prices by restricting where houses can be built. In its paper The Green Noose, it wrote that [...] "simply removing restrictions on land 10 minutes’ walk of a railway station would allow the development of 1 million more homes within the Green Belt surrounding London alone". The ASI believes that instead of simply putting a blanket <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>building</b> in the areas surrounding cities, instead planning permission should be granted based on the environmental, historic and scientific value of the land.|$|E
50|$|The House, however, was in {{a budget}} cutting mood. It passed the highway bill on July 3. This {{legislation}} eliminated all funding for of the Highway Beautification Act; eliminated the <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>building</b> federally funded highways in parks, wildlife refuges, historic sites, and other protected areas; and banned the executive branch from administratively freezing the expenditure of funds. Additionally, the House bill required that D.C. complete its highway system, added 3000 mi to the interstate system, and funded a Maryland proposal to construct a Fort Washington Parkway along the north/eastern shore of the Potomac River from the D.C. boundary south to Fort Washington, Maryland.|$|E

5000|$|... The Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in March 2010 {{narrowly}} {{passed a}} resolution condemning [...] "defamation of religion", which included reference to [...] "Islamophobic" [...] <b>bans</b> <b>on</b> <b>building</b> new minarets <b>on</b> mosques. The resolution was proposed by the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC). OIC representative Babacar Ba said that the resolution was a [...] "way to reaffirm once again our condemnation {{of the decision to}} ban construction of minarets in Switzerland." [...] The resolution was opposed mostly by Western nations, while it gained majority due to the votes of Muslim nations, besides the support of Cuba and China. Eight states abstained. US ambassador Eileen Donahoe criticised the resolution as an [...] "instrument of division" [...] and an [...] "ineffective way to address" [...] concerns about discrimination. The ban was also mentioned in the UNHRC special rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in his 2010 report to the United Nations General Assembly.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>building</b> {{additional}} hotel accommodation, introduced from Bern in 1915 as {{an emergency}} response to overcapacity created by the pre-1914 building boom, continued in force in a succession of modified forms {{for more than three}} decades, but a further extension of it was rejected by national referendum on 2 March 1952, after which it was finally lifted. [...] Although it was the national decision that the legislators were required to respect, within the canton of Graubünden a large majority of participating citizens had actually voted to perpetuate the ban further, presumably reflecting concerns over possible adverse economic consequences locally of a renewed increase in hotel beds nationally.|$|E
50|$|In 1796 a <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>building</b> {{outside the}} town walls ended, and the town began to expand beyond. The suburb of Neustadt (Danish: Nystaden, meaning Newtown) {{was built in the}} {{neighborhood}} of the Nordertor. In 1913/14 the gate was restored by the architect Paul Ziegler, and a clock was installed. In 1966 the Deutsche Bundespost issued a 30 Pfennig stamp with the gate's image. Over 3 billion of these stamps for letter post were sold. In the 1990s the gate was again restored and the clock was removed. In 2004 the gate was licensed as a venue for civil weddings, so that weddings are now performed in a room above the archway of the gate.|$|E
5000|$|In 1977, Executive Director Morris Levitt {{asserted}} that nuclear fusion power plants {{could be built}} by 1990 if the U.S. spent $50 to $100 billion on research. The same year he announced {{that there would be}} no United States in the 21st century if President Jimmy Carter's <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>building</b> breeder reactors was maintained. The director of the fusion power program at Argonne National Laboratory, Charles Baker, said in 1983 that the FEF was [...] "overstating" [...] the prospect of practical fusion power in the near future.

50|$|San Marino {{is highly}} {{restrictive}} of commercial {{operations in the}} city. It {{is one of the}} few cities that requires commercial vehicles to have permits to work within the city. The rationale is that commercial vehicle operators and service providers, such as gardeners, pool service providers and maintenance workers, are more likely to cause social disruption within the city, and so must be preauthorized for crime control and prosecutorial purposes. This regulation and others, including the <b>bans</b> <b>on</b> apartment <b>buildings,</b> townhouses and overnight parking, are some of the more obvious examples.|$|R
25|$|Reinhard Ries, {{the fire}} chief in Frankfurt, Germany, was {{critical}} of lax fire regulations in the United Kingdom, contrasting the laws in Germany that <b>ban</b> flammable cladding <b>on</b> <b>buildings</b> higher than 22m and require segregated fire-stairs and firefighting lifts {{which can be used}} by the fire brigade and injured or disabled people.|$|R

5000|$|Shores of {{the pond}} were cleaned to some extent in 2008. At that time, the study on saving the pond was done. Proposed short term {{interventions}} included cleaning of the garbage from the lake and the surrounding area, emptying and closing of the cesspits and <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>building</b> on the slopes above the pond. Further, long-term measures should include the chemical and bacteriological analysis of the water, creation of the [...] "wet field" [...] which would naturally filter the water, channeling of the creek to reach the pond again and {{the restoration of the}} sinkhole. Another study from 2012 proposed that the pond should be saved with the construction of the sewage system and by placing Rakina bara under protection. However, the pond and the surroundings are too polluted, thus not fulfilling the basic conditions for protection. As for the other proposals, none of them turned into projects, due to either lack of funds (municipality of Čukarica) or the typical bureaucratic [...] "it is not my jurisdiction" [...] attitude (city, communal companies).|$|E
50|$|A <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>building</b> {{of public}} {{buildings}} (caused by shortage of labour) came {{into effect in}} 1962, which meant that the planned building of Bistrup Church had to be postponed. Schwarz-Nielsen gathered a group of volunteers from the parish, 120 in total, so they could build the church themselves, an approach that not attempted in Denmark for some 800 years. Originally they were only aiming at building part of {{the ground floor of}} the church, which was completed in 1963, but as they were proceeding well they continued for another four years with the main part containing the church room proper and the 21 meters tall tower. Subsequently, Johan took the initiative for helping to build several buildings, including the 'Henrik Gerners Børnehaven' kindergarten between 1970 and 1973; 'Gerner Salen', an annex to the church between 1978 and 1979; and the 'Marie Gerner Gården' creche from 1979 to 1981. All these projects were organised as independent non-profit organisations and the necessary funds were mainly collected in the parish for these specific purposes. In 1982 Johan went to Cyprus as Army Chaplain with the peacekeeping Danish DANCON UN-contingent, a natural continuation of his service in Akademisk Skytteforening, O-gruppe 2, during the Occupation of Denmark 1940-1945.|$|E
25|$|Jews {{lived in}} at least forty-three Jewish {{communities}} in Palestine: twelve towns on the coast, in the Negev, and east of the Jordan, and thirty-one villages in Galilee and in the Jordan valley. The persecuted Jews of Palestine revolted twice against their Christian rulers. In the 5th century, the Western Roman Empire collapsed leading to Christian migration into Palestine and development of a Christian majority. Jews numbered 10–15% of the population. Judaism was the only non-Christian religion tolerated, but there were <b>bans</b> <b>on</b> Jews <b>building</b> new places of worship, holding public office or owning slaves. There were also two Samaritan revolts during this period.|$|R
500|$|Also, the Dutch Foreign Ministry {{allegedly}} {{would have}} issued guidelines to its embassies {{on how to}} react to questions about the role being played by the PVV and Wilders {{in the formation of}} a new government. On 10 August 2010, the website of Dutch daily newspaper NRC Handelsblad published the ministry memo. The ministry itself however had declined [...] "to confirm or deny" [...] the authenticity of these guidelines. One question posed is how Wilders could be taking part in negotiations on forming a government coalition when he has been indicted for inciting hatred and discrimination, and for insulting a group of persons. Other questions covered possible <b>bans</b> <b>on</b> the <b>building</b> of new mosques, on the Quran and on Islamic schools in the Netherlands. The memo stressed that such bans would breach the Dutch constitution.|$|R
5|$|Traditionally, {{the mining}} {{industry}} in Svalbard {{has had more}} rights to operations within protected areas than in mainland Norway, where all such activities would be completely banned. Indre Wijdefjorden has the most strict regulations, with a total <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> construction of <b>buildings</b> and facilities, laying of cables and roads, earthwork, drainage, drilling, blasting, and excavation of petroleum, gas and minerals. It is the authorities' goal that Svalbard is {{to be one of}} the best-managed wilderness areas in the world. Svalbard, and thus the national park, is on Norway's tentative list for nomination as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{after the}} Alteration (the change {{of power from}} a Catholic to a Protestant city council), when Amsterdam finally joined the revolt led by William of Orange against Spain, the new mayors, among whom {{were some of the}} landowners on Lastage, made plans for the area and for the {{expansion}} and renovation of the port. When a <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>building</b> activities was declared in 1579, the city council wanted to expropriate the land in Lastage, a proposal deemed unacceptable by the local landowners. On the other hand, the high land value made it unacceptable for the city council to consider buying the land instead. In the following years a number of landowners agreed to an estimated value determined by a committee. Two owners, namely the rope maker Claes Burchmansz. Dob and Robrecht Cools, refused and were taken to court. The proceedings were taken {{all the way up to}} the highest body, the Court of Holland. The city council was by now in a hurry to make the area more defensible against attacks, especially after Antwerp had fallen and there was a serious risk that the Duke of Parma would advance north towards Amsterdam. Dob and Cools were eventually forced to agree and cooperate, and hastily a defensive rampart was erected, known today as Oudeschans.|$|E
5000|$|Within Bismarck's Kulturkampf policy, the Poles were purposefully {{presented}} as [...] "foes of the empire" [...] (Reichsfeinde). As the Prussian authorities suppressed Catholic services in Polish language by Polish priests, the Poles {{had to rely}} on German Catholic priests. Later, in 1885, the Prussian Settlement Commission was set up from the national government's funds with a mission to buy land from Polish owners and distribute it among German colonists. Eventually, 150,000 were settled on Polish territories.This was further strengthened by the <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>building</b> of houses by Poles (see Drzymała's van)Another means of the policy was the elimination of non-German languages from public life, schools and from academic settings. At its extremes, the Germanisation policies in schools took the form of abuse of Polish children by Prussian officials (see Września children strike). In 1890 the Germanisation of Poles was slightly eased {{for a couple of years}} but the activities intensified again since 1894 and continued until the end of the World War I. This led to international condemnation, e.g., an international meeting of socialists held in Brussels in 1902 called the Germanisation of Poles in Prussia [...] "barbarous". Nevertheless, the Settlement Commission was empowered with new more powerful rights, which entitled it to force Poles to sell the land since 1908.|$|E
5000|$|Catholic bishops {{oppose a}} minaret ban. A {{statement}} from the Swiss Bishops Conference said that a ban would hinder interreligious dialogue and that the construction and operation of minarets were already regulated by Swiss building codes. The statement added that [...] "Our request for the initiative to be rejected is based on our Christian values and the democratic principles in our country." [...] The official journal of the Catholic Church in Switzerland published {{a series of articles}} on the minaret controversy.The Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches holds that the federal popular initiative is not about minarets, but is rather an expression of the initiators’ concern and fear of Islam. It views a minaret ban as a wrong approach to express such objections.The Swiss Federation of Jewish Communities are also against any <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>building</b> minarets. Dr Herbert Winter, the president of the Federation, says: “As Jews we have our own experience. For centuries we were excluded: we were not allowed to construct synagogues or cupola roofs. We do not want that kind of exclusion repeated.” Many other religious organisations describe the idea of a complete minaret ban as lamentable. These are: the Association of Evangelical Free Churches and Communities in Switzerland; the Swiss Evangelical Alliance; the Old Catholic Church in Switzerland; the Covenant ofSwiss Baptists; the Salvation Army; the Federation of Evangelical Lutheran Churches in Switzerland; the Orthodox Diocese the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople; the Serbian Orthodox Church in Switzerland; and the Anglican Church in Switzerland.|$|E
5000|$|On 18 December 1920 the {{government}} renewed the [...] "Decree protect ... the Hotels Industry from the Consequences of he War", {{which it had}} originally promulgated as an emergency wartime measure. The qualified debt moratorium was thereby sustained, along with the <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> new hotel <b>building</b> which was strictly enforced. In the end, as demand for hotel accommodation {{showed no sign of}} returning to prewar levels, a <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> new hotels and on expansion of existing hotels found its way into the standard legal code, with a statute ratified on 16 October 1924, and effective from 1 January 1926. In the meantime the [...] "Schweizerische Hotel-Treuhand-Gesellschaft", established in 1921, in some respects took over where the Graubünden Credit Co-operative left off, providing low interest credit to hotels for renovation and modernisation of existing facilities, notably in response to increased customer expectations regarding bathroom and toilet facilities.|$|R
50|$|When it {{was done}} in 1634, it was the first {{fortified}} church in Moldavia. The style forms part of the traditional Moldavian architecture, but the bell tower is endowed with parapets. The bridge is entirely fortified, with gaps for arrows and rifles, and a path for lookouts. It has been speculated that the Ottoman <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> repairing military <b>buildings</b> did not apply to churches. The bell, from 1628, is Barnovschi's gift, and was cast at Lviv. The church was associated with the local beggars' guild. Paul of Aleppo visited in 1653, writing that he saw displayed in the nave a portrait of Barnovschi on a white horse. In 1803, upon the request of Metropolitan Veniamin Costache, it became a dependency of the Huși Diocese.|$|R
40|$|Since 9 / 11, 2001, a {{new form}} of {{religious}} extremism has arguably emerged, one which paradoxically portrays itself as a counter to another perceived extremism regarded as a real and imminent threat. Within North America and Western Europe, as elsewhere, there is an upsurge of various forms of reactionary rhetoric and opposition expressed towards Islam and Muslims. An increase in extremist behaviour, even violence, is appearing from quarters opposed to, or varyingly fearful of, Islamic extremism if not Islam or Muslims. Islamophobia, as a manifestation of fear of an exclusionary Islam, manifests as exclusionary or negatively reactive behaviours with Muslims and Islam as the target. This article explores the idea that Islamophobia can be regarded as a manifestation of religious extremism and, further, that such extremism is construable as “reactive co-radicalization. ” It focuses on two European cases – the 2009 Swiss <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> the <b>building</b> of minarets and the 2011 Norwegian massacre carried out by Anders Breivik – as examples of this “reactive co-radicalization. ” This term, I suggest, is an apt denominator for the exclusionary reaction to the rising presence of Islam within otherwise secular, albeit nominally Christian, Western European and North American societies, among others...|$|R
