40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to specifically identify {{the problems and}} challenges of environmental legislation in Zimbabwe and the need, for implementing an integrated approach to managing the environment. The researcher commissioned a survey in which 100 respondents comprising institutional heads, local leaders, farmers, communal and urban settlers were selected. These were served with questionnaires. Follow up interviews, direct observations and documentary reviews were also employed in collecting the data that is presented. After a thorough analysis of the data, major findings emerged from which conclusions <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> the legislation before EMA was fragmented and outdated. Whilst EMA is punitive to some degree, it lacked adequate human and financial resources to enforce it. Furthermore there was partial integration of the various statutes which guided the management of natural resources in a holistic manner. The study recommends {{the need for a}} cohesive and appropriate environmental management delivery strategy that calls for an integrated approach with enough institutional support, funding and administration to ensure successful implementation. The effectiveness of environmental law in Zimbabwe is seen by the success and failure in providing environmental justice, fostering public participation and ensuring that legislation adequately protects the environment from pollution and degradation.

40|$|The present {{thesis is}} divided {{into a number of}} {{unrelated}} topics, due mainly to interruptions brought about by the war. The original purpose was to carry out an investigation on the ozonization of unsaturated organic acids with the object of establishing more evidence for possible constitutional relationships between ozonides and peroxides, the latter having been the subject of considerable research in the MeGill University laboratories. This investigation, which was cut short by the advent of war, was launched from two seemingly different points of attack. The first, based on the ozonolysis mechanism advanced by Harries and his coworkers, concerns itself with methods for the quantitative estimation of hydrogen peroxide liberated by the hydrolysis of ozonides in solution. The second, founded on physicochemical principles, deals with the variation of the refractive index during ozonization.

In this way the benefits of the new development will serve to reinforce the vitality and viability of the existing centre. <b>In</b> <b>that</b> context, it is perhaps unsurprising that our recent Town & Country Planning article on ‘Linked trips and town centre viability’, 4 which provided new evidence on this issue drawn from a study of the relocation of a previously ‘out-of-centre’ foodstore to an ‘edge-of-centre’ site, has generated considerable interest, or that our findings have rapidly found their way into the planning process. 5 Nevertheless, as we suggested <b>in</b> <b>that</b> article, the available evidence base on linked trips which the UK planning community can draw on remains extremely restricted.
