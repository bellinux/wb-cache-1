5|$|Common battery {{technologies}} used in today's home PV systems include, {{the valve}} regulated lead-acid battery– {{a modified version}} of the conventional lead–acid battery, nickel–cadmium and lithium-ion <b>batteries.</b> Lead-acid <b>batteries</b> are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion <b>batteries</b> have the potential to replace lead-acid <b>batteries</b> in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the Gigafactory 1. In addition, the Li-ion <b>batteries</b> of plug-in electric cars may serve as a future storage devices in a vehicle-to-grid system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their <b>batteries</b> could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable <b>batteries</b> used for distributed PV systems include, sodium–sulfur and vanadium redox <b>batteries,</b> two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{invention}} of the Leclanché cell in 1866 and the subsequent improvement of the <b>batteries</b> containing manganese dioxide as cathodic depolarizer increased the demand of manganese dioxide. Until the development <b>batteries</b> with nickel-cadmium and lithium, most <b>batteries</b> contained manganese. The zinc-carbon battery and the alkaline battery normally use industrially produced manganese dioxide because natural occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities. In the 20th century, manganese dioxide was widely used as the cathodic for commercial disposable dry <b>batteries</b> of both the standard (zinc-carbon) and alkaline types.|$|E

5|$|The largest use {{of lead in}} {{the early}} 21st century is in lead–acid <b>batteries.</b> The {{reactions}} in the battery between lead, lead dioxide, and sulfuric acid provide a reliable source of voltage. The lead in <b>batteries</b> undergoes no direct contact with humans, so there are fewer toxicity concerns. Supercapacitors incorporating lead–acid <b>batteries</b> have been installed in kilowatt and megawatt scale applications in Australia, Japan, and the United States in frequency regulation, solar smoothing and shifting, wind smoothing, and other applications. These <b>batteries</b> have lower energy density and charge-discharge efficiency than lithium-ion <b>batteries,</b> but are significantly cheaper.|$|E

5|$|Assuming this {{warning shot}} {{had been fired}} {{in the belief that}} his brig, which was not flying a flag, may be an enemy vessel, Barlow ordered the British naval ensign and the pennant of the Channel Fleet run up. Thus clearly {{identified}} as a neutral British warship, Barlow allowed Childers to drift closer inshore with the tide. The French battery responded by raising tricolour flags and red pennants, a move copied by the other <b>batteries</b> covering the Goulet.

5|$|Beginning around 1 pm, Union {{artillery}} fired first, initially upon infantry in the woods, {{and later}} upon any Confederate artillery that attempted {{to move into}} firing position. On the Confederate left flank, two <b>batteries</b> from Whiting's division and one from Jackson's soon began firing from their position upon Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, who were {{near the center of}} the Union line. This began a fierce firefight, with the Union's eight <b>batteries</b> and 37 guns concentrated against three Confederate <b>batteries</b> and sixteen guns. The Union fire silenced the Rowan Artillery and made their position untenable. The other two Confederate <b>batteries,</b> placed by Jackson himself, were in somewhat better positions, and managed to keep firing. Over a period of more than three hours, a total of six or eight Confederate <b>batteries</b> engaged the Union Army from the Confederate left flank, but they were usually engaged only one at a time.|$|E

5|$|Carriage and {{shipment}} of {{some kinds of}} lithium <b>batteries</b> may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation (particularly aircraft) because of the ability of most types of lithium <b>batteries</b> to fully discharge very rapidly when short-circuited, leading to overheating and possible explosion in a process called thermal runaway. Most consumer lithium <b>batteries</b> have built-in thermal overload protection to prevent this type of incident, or are otherwise designed to limit short-circuit currents. Internal shorts from manufacturing defect or physical damage can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway.|$|E

5|$|Late in the 20th century, lithium {{became an}} {{important}} component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential. Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells. Lithium-ion <b>batteries,</b> which are rechargeable and have a high energy density, {{should not be confused with}} lithium <b>batteries,</b> which are disposable (primary) <b>batteries</b> with lithium or its compounds as the anode. Other rechargeable <b>batteries</b> that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.|$|E
5|$|Lithium and its {{compounds}} {{have several}} industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium <b>batteries,</b> and lithium-ion <b>batteries.</b> These uses consume more than three quarters of lithium production.|$|E
5|$|Lithium-ion <b>batteries</b> {{may suffer}} thermal runaway and cell rupture if {{overheated}} or overcharged, and {{in extreme cases}} {{this can lead to}} combustion. To reduce these risks, lithium-ion battery packs contain fail-safe circuitry that shuts down the battery when its voltage is outside the safe range. When handled improperly, or if manufactured defectively, some rechargeable <b>batteries</b> can experience thermal runaway resulting in overheating. Especially prone to thermal runaway are lithium-ion <b>batteries.</b> Reports of exploding cellphones have been reported in newspapers. In 2006, <b>batteries</b> from Apple, HP, Toshiba, Lenovo, Dell and other notebook manufacturers were recalled because of fire and explosions. Also, during the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's first year of service, at least four aircraft suffered from electrical system problems stemming from its lithium-ion <b>batteries,</b> resulting in the whole Dreamliner fleet being voluntarily grounded in January 2013.|$|E
