5|$|Regarding Stiller's long wins, Tim Krabbé {{struck a}} similar note: A {{grandmaster}} wouldn't {{be better at}} these endgames than someone who had learned chess yesterday. It's a sort of chess {{that has nothing to}} do with chess, a chess that we could never have imagined without computers. The Stiller moves are awesome, almost scary, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> they are the truth, God's Algorithm – it's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't understand one word.|$|E
25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of Midtown Madness were {{generally}} positive, with video game critics praising its gameplay. IGN {{wrote that the}} game [...] "doesn't rely heavily on driving authenticity; this game's all about fun." [...] The review also praised the simplicity whereby players can [...] "pick a real-world car and go". GameSpot wrote that [...] "it's fun {{to be able to}} drive like a maniac [...] <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> you can't in real life." [...] Computer and Video Games remarked on the game's humor, provided by other drivers, police, and competitors (described as maniacs), praising the [...] "carnage that unfolds before your windscreen". PC Zone recommended the game, calling it highly refreshing; Total Video Games said the game seemed a good choice, but suggested that it would be outdone by GT Interactive's Driver, released soon after.|$|E

500|$|Grant married Dyan Cannon on July 22, 1965, at friend Howard Hughes' Desert Inn in Las Vegas. Their daughter, Jennifer, {{was born}} on February 26, 1966. Jennifer is Grant's only child. He {{frequently}} called Jennifer his [...] "best production". He said of fatherhood: [...] "My life changed the day Jennifer was born. I've come {{to think that the}} reason we're put on this earth is to procreate. To leave something behind. Not films, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that I don't think my films will last very long once I'm gone. But another human being. That's what's important." [...] Grant and Cannon divorced in March 1968. On March 12 that month he was involved in a car accident on Long Island when a truck struck the side of his limousine. Grant was hospitalized for 17 days with three broken ribs and bruising.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his career, Bacon {{consciously}} {{and carefully}} avoided explaining the meaning behind his paintings, and pointedly observed {{that they were}} not intended as narratives, nor open to interpretation. When Bragg challenged him with the observation that Triptych, May–June 1973 was the nearest the artist had come to telling a story, Bacon admitted that [...] "it is in fact the nearest I've ever done to a story, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that is the triptych of how [...] was found". He {{went on to say that}} the work reflected not just his reaction to Dyer's death, but his general feelings about the fact that his friends were then dying around him [...] "like flies". A borderline alcoholic himself, Bacon continued to explain that his dead friends were [...] "generally heavy drinkers", and that their deaths led directly to his composition of a series of meditative self-portraits which emphasised his own aging and awareness of the passage of time.|$|E
500|$|Satin defined {{himself as}} a neopacifist or quasi-pacifist– flexible, media-savvy, and entrepreneurial. [...] He told one {{journalist}} he might have fought against Hitler. [...] He was not necessarily opposed to the draft, telling reporters he would support it for a defensive army or to help eliminate poverty, illiteracy, and racial discrimination. [...] He avoided the intellectual framework of traditional pacifism and socialism. [...] Sometimes he spoke with emotion, as when he described the United States to The New York Times Magazine as [...] "hat godawful sick, foul country; could anything be worse?" [...] Sometimes he spoke poetically, as when he told author Jules Witcover, [...] "It's colder here, but you feel warm <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> you're not trying to kill people." [...] Instead of identifying with older pacifists, he identified with a 17-year-old character from the pen of J. D. Salinger: [...] "I was Holden Caulfield", he said in 2008, [...] "just standing and catching in the rye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘And yet {{you used}} to be in such a quandary <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> nobody <b>you</b> could make your women-folk out of! Do you mind that, and how we both laughed at the notion of your having to make them out of me?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mary," [...] she said, {{speaking}} in a voice which had recovered its firmness, [...] "I loved you so much, and I had never done anything wrong, and--and {{you said you would}} always love and trust me <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> that I was good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's <b>because</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> anything," [...] he said violently, harshly. [...] "Laugh at what <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> not at {{what you}} don't know." ...|$|R
500|$|Hoffman {{occasionally}} {{changed his}} hair and lost or gained weight for parts, {{and he went to}} great lengths to reveal the worst in his characters. But in a 2012 interview he confessed that performing to a high standard was a challenge: [...] "The job isn't difficult. Doing it well is difficult." [...] In an earlier interview with The New York Times, he explained how deeply he loved acting but added, [...] "that deep kind of love comes at a price: for me, acting is torturous, and it's torturous <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it's a beautiful thing... Wanting it is easy, but trying to be great– well, that's absolutely torturous." [...] This struggle was confirmed by the author John le Carré, who met Hoffman during the adaptation of his novel A Most Wanted Man. While praising the actor's intelligence and intuition, le Carré acknowledged the burden that Hoffman felt: [...] "It was painful and exhausting work, and probably in the end his undoing. The world was too bright for him to handle." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reactions}} of the episode were positive. Chris Carabott of IGN rated the episode 9 out of 10, calling it [...] "a swift return to form" [...] with [...] "plenty of striking and emotional moments" [...] that made {{it one of the}} better episodes of the first season. Carabott commented on the flashbacks; [...] "We don't necessarily learn anything new about Jack from a personality standpoint," [...] but Fox did [...] "an exceptional job of conveying Jack's heartbreak as he reveals that his father operated on a woman while under the influence of alcohol." [...] He enjoyed Jack and Ethan's encounter, calling it [...] "chilling." [...] Carabott also praised the scene where Jack tries to save Charlie; [...] "I remember believing that they had killed off Charlie on my initial viewing and even though I knew the outcome this time, it was still a hard scene to watch," [...] adding [...] "after Jack finally manages to resuscitate him, you have to feel for Charlie <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that he's disappointed in himself for letting Claire down." [...] Another IGN article ranked [...] "All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues" [...] the 33rd best Lost episode.|$|E
500|$|The Tsarina {{relied on}} the counsel of Grigori Rasputin, a Russian peasant and {{wandering}} starets or [...] "holy man", and credited his prayers with saving the ailing Tsarevich on numerous occasions. Tatiana and her siblings were also taught to view Rasputin as [...] "Our Friend" [...] and to share confidences with him. In the autumn of 1907, Tatiana's aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia was escorted to the nursery by the Tsar to meet Rasputin. Tatiana and her sisters and brother were all wearing their long white nightgowns. The children appeared to be friendly with Rasputin and comfortable in his company. Rasputin's friendship with the children was also evident {{in some of the}} messages he sent to them. In February 1909, Rasputin sent the imperial children a telegram, advising them to [...] "Love the whole of God's nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework." [...] Eleven-year-old Tatiana wrote a letter asking Rasputin to visit her and telling him how hard it was to see her mother ill. [...] "But you know <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> everything," [...] she wrote.|$|E

6000|$|... "Very well," [...] Hulton resumed in a shaky voice. [...] "I brought <b>you</b> here <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> {{my son and}} I wanted your support. Then I {{meant to}} {{convince}} Percival, whose help I may need to clear the boy's good name. We'll let that go {{and try to be}} practical." ...|$|R
500|$|Moore {{described}} the recording process as challenging {{because she was}} provided with little visual aid, explaining, [...] "All I had to work off were a few sketches ... {{but it was also}} fun because it allows you to go into the depths of your imagination." [...] She also revealed that creating Rapunzel's voice was simply a process of [...] "let go". Moore was often required to re-record a single line a total of four times before the directors finally heard a version with which they were satisfied. After watching the completed film for the first time, Moore was disappointed with her own performance because she felt that her voice sounded [...] "shrill". According to composer Alan Menken, Moore's musical background made her [...] "a delight to work with". Moore found the practice of performing in character challenging in comparison to recording her own original music, explaining, [...] "I can't just be like Mandy and sing something the way that I want to necessarily, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> you sort of have to stick to certain guidelines." [...] She found recording [...] "When Will My Life Begin" [...] particularly difficult due to the speed at which she had to say certain words, and cites both Menken and discovering Rapunzel herself as a character with guiding her through the process.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the issue}} of obesity, Watson has also been quoted as saying, 2000: [...] "Whenever you {{interview}} fat people, you feel bad, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> you're not going to hire them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 1934 Osip Mandelstam recited his [...] "Stalin Epigram" [...] to Pasternak. After listening, Pasternak told Mandelstam: [...] "I didn't hear this, you didn't recite it to me, <b>because,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> {{very strange}} and terrible things are {{happening}} now: they've begun to pick people up. I'm afraid the walls have ears and perhaps even these benches on the boulevard here {{may be able to}} listen and tell tales. So let's make out that I heard nothing." ...|$|E

But will you first {{just tell me}} this--whether when you sent in ten minutes ago for Lord John {{to come out to}} you it was wholly of your own movement?"

6000|$|... "That is to say, you understand," [...] our bright-eyed boy says, [...] "I {{am going}} to give you my version of it.

2500|$|The set {{has been}} {{described}} as organized chaos but the cast felt protected when they took big risks. Short stated that [...] "If you're working with a great director, you feel very, very, very safe <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that all the decisions will be made months later in the editing room." [...] Malone stated that [...] "it was a very structured process" [...] and that the [...] "chaos can only come from a grounded, logical base because you have to know where you're going to be spinning from. The logic becomes the chaos and the chaos becomes the logic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hinrich {{started the}} {{exhibition}} game against Lithuania on August 13, 2006. He scored 10 points, had 2 steals, and shot 80% {{from the field}} in a US win. After the game, Hinrich was asked about starting the game. He responded, [...] "We're playing in groups right now. I know when I get my time, I just {{try to make the}} best of it, make sure our team is successful. It's one of those deals when you play in groups in spurts like that, it's a little bit tougher. But, you don't hold back and give it everything you got <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> you'll be rested a lot." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2015, Hopkins {{appeared}} as Sir in a BBC Two production of Ronald Harwood's The Dresser, alongside Ian McKellen, Edward Fox and Emily Watson. The Dresser {{is set in}} a London theatre during the Blitz, where an aging actor-manager, Sir, prepares for his starring role in King Lear {{with the help of his}} devoted dresser, Norman. Hopkins described his role as Sir as “the highlight of my life”. “It was a chance to work with the actors I had run away from. To play another actor is fun <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> the ins and outs of their thinking – especially with someone like Sir, who is a diabolically insecure, egotistical man." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} first {{election}} to the Senate, Lieberman was approached by incoming Majority Leader George Mitchell who advised him, [...] "Pick out two or three areas that you’re really interested in and learn them so that your colleagues know what you’re talking about...You’re {{going to have more}} influence even as a freshman than you think <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> there’s hundreds of issues and inevitably we rely on each other.” Recalling the conversation, Lieberman has said, [...] "that was true when I first came in, although you could see partisanship beginning to eat away at that. But {{at the end of my}} 24 years, it was really so partisan that it was hard to make the combinations to get to 60 votes to break a filibuster to get things done." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 8, 2007, Ellison {{discussed}} {{the power of}} the executive branch in a speech before the organization Atheists for Human Rights. He stated that Dick Cheney said it was [...] "beneath his dignity in order for him to answer any questions from the citizens of the United States. That is the very definition of totalitarianism, authoritarianism and dictatorship." [...] He went on to say, [...] "It's almost like the Reichstag fire, kind of reminds me of that. After the Reichstag was burned, they blamed the Communists for it and it put the leader of that country, Hitler, in a position where he could basically have authority to do whatever he wanted. The fact is that I'm not saying September 11 was a U.S. plan or anything like that <b>because,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> that's how they put you in the nut-ball box — dismiss you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2007, while {{speaking}} about issuing a draft, McCain said, [...] "One, it's the best military we've ever had, it just isn't big enough. Two, there's {{never been a}} draft that I've ever heard of since World War II that was fair. What we've done is we find rich people find a way out, and lower income people {{are the ones that}} serve. I might consider it, I don't think it's necessary, but I might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally would serve. But it just doesn't happen. And the other thing is that, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> from here in Brauman, it takes intensive training with the equipment and the technical skills that now our people are required to engage in, that it makes it not conducive to a short term. Now they enlist for 4 years. We used to draft people almost for 2 years or even 18 months so it's much more difficult." ...|$|E
