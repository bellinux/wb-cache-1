40|$|Electroless nickel-phosphorus (NiP) layers with {{different}} phosphorous concentrations were deposited using in-situ techniques for {{measurement and control}} of the plating process. To achieve a constant Ni-concentration and pH, we utilized a control system including photometric-, pH-sensors and a <b>batch</b> <b>feeder.</b> A decreasing pH value leads to increasing phosphorous concentrations. Furthermore, we devised a complexometric titration technique to analyze the chemical composition of electroless NiP and confirmed its accuracy by comparison to well-established gravimetric analysis. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) at temperatures ranging from 86 K to 373 K of electroless NiP layers containing different phosphorous concentrations was analyzed using a push-rod dilatometer. Finally, we demonstrate that the CTE of electroless NiP is precisely adjustable via the deposition parameters of the electrolyte...|$|E
40|$|The work {{includes}} the mechanical analysis of mechanical feeders and batchers that find application in various technological processes and industrial fields. Feeders are usually classified {{according to their}} design features into two groups: conveyor-type feeders and non-conveyor feeders. Batchers are used to batch solid bulk materials. Less frequently, they are used for liquids. In terms of a batching method, they are divided into volumetric and weighting batchers. Weighting batchers do not provide for sufficient batching accuracy. Automatic weighting batchers include a mass controlling sensor and systems for automatic material feed and automatic mass discharge control. In terms of operating principle, batchers are divided into gravitational batchers and batchers with forced feed of material using conveyors and pumps. Improved consumption of raw materials, decreased loss of materials, ease of use in automatic control systems of industrial facilities allows increasing the quality of technological processes and improve labor conditions. The <b>batch</b> <b>feeder</b> suggested by the authors is a volumetric batcher that has no comparable counterparts among conveyor-type feeders and allows solving the problem of targeted feeding of bulk material batches increasing reliability and hermeticity of the device...|$|E
40|$|Glass {{production}} is an energy intensive process, primarily requiring high temperature (≈ 1500 oC) heat, usually provided by combustion of fossil fuels. Concerns {{about the future}} depletion of fossil fuels and the emissions due to their combustion have driven a shift towards the use of alternative energy sources. Concentrated solar radiation is the only form of renewable energy which could directly provide the high temperature process heat required for glass production, without the otherwise necessary intermediate conversion to electricity and thereby avoiding the associated efficiency and capital costs. The technology for concentrating solar radiation using fields of heliostat mirrors to collectively generate a high intensity beam at a central focal point, is already well developed. However, {{the ability to use}} of such a solar beam to effect a viable glass making process involves significant challenges associated with the fact that glass furnaces typically require continuous and consistent process heat smoothly distributed, over large areas while concentrated solar radiation is only intermittently available and provides heat over relatively small areas with steep intensity gradients. In this project, experiments were conducted to incrementally develop and investigate the feasibility of an efficient and scalable process for manufacturing useful glasses with the primary process heat demand provided by a realistic concentrated solar beam. A High Flux Solar Simulator (HFSS) consisting of an array of xenon arc lamps, each coupled with an ellipsoidal reflector, was used to generate an artificial, controllable ‘solar’ beam. First, the HFSS beam was used to directly irradiate pure silica and soda-lime-silica glass forming batches contained inside insulated, refractory crucibles and directly irradiated by a realistic solar beam (intensity < 2000 kW/m 2). All silicate batches generated complete melt pools with full conversion from crystalline raw materials, to x-ray amorphous glasses but only soda-lime-silica batches would generate melts with sufficient fluidity to homogenise and remove entrained gases (fining) and thereby produce transparent glasses. Next, a series of experiments were conducted to investigate factors affecting the continuity of the process. Glass forming batch, directly irradiated by a vertical HFSS beam, was contained inside a modified apparatus which enabled the melt produced to sustain a continuous flow. A specially made <b>batch</b> <b>feeder</b> enabled additional raw materials to be intermittently fed into the melting zone while the beam was still on. It was demonstrated that a semi-continuous glass melting process could be realised using primarily concentrated solar heat. However, secondary heating was necessary to sustain the flow beyond the focal spot of the beam while avoiding fracture of the crucible due to thermal gradients induced by the beam. Also, the efficiency of this process was very poor (3 - 4...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the optimization for a placement machine in printed circuit board (PCB) assembly when family setup strategy is adopted. Design/methodology/approach - A complete mathematical model is developed for the integrated problem to optimize feeder arrangement and component placement sequences so as to minimize the makespan for a set of PCB batches. Owing to the complexity of the problem, a specific genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed. Findings - The established model is able to find the minimal makespan for a set of PCB batches through determining the feeder arrangement and placement sequences. However, exact solutions to the problem are not practical due to the complexity. Experimental tests show that the proposed GA can solve the problem both effectively and efficiently. Research limitations/implications - When a placement machine is set up for production of a set of PCB <b>batches,</b> the <b>feeder</b> arrangement of the machine together with the component placement sequencing for each PCB type should be solved simultaneously so as to minimize the overall makespan. Practical implications - The paper investigates the optimization for PCB assembly with family setup strategy, which is adopted by many PCB manufacturers for reducing both setup costs and human errors. Originality/value - The paper investigates the feeder arrangement and placement sequencing problems when family setup strategy is adopted, which has not been studied in the literature.

40|$|Growth arrested Swiss mouse {{embryonic}} 3 T 3 {{cells are}} used as feeders to support the growth of epidermal keratinocytes and several other target cells. The 3 T 3 cells have been extensively subcultured owing to their popularity and wide distribution in the world and, as a consequence selective inclusion of variants is a strong possibility in them. Inadvertently selected variants expressing innate resistance to mitomycin C may continue to proliferate even after treatment with such growth arresting agents. The failure of growth arrest {{can lead to a}} serious risk of proliferative feeder contamination in target cell cultures. In this study, we passaged Swiss 3 T 3 cells (CCL- 92, ATCC) by different seeding densities and incubation periods. We tested the resultant cultures for differences in anchorage-independent growth, resumption of proliferation after mitomycin C treatment and occurrence of proliferative feeder contaminants in an epidermal keratinocyte co-culture system. The study revealed subculture dependent differential responses. The cultures of a particular subculture procedure displayed unique cell size distribution and disintegrated completely in 6 weeks following mitomycin C treatment, but their repeated subculture resulted in feeder regrowth as late as 11 weeks after the growth arrest. In contrast, mitomycin C failed to inhibit cell proliferation in cultures of the other subculture schemes and also in a clone that was established from a transformation focus of super-confluent culture. The resultant proliferative feeder cells contaminated the keratinocyte cultures. The anchorage-independent growth appeared in late passages as compared with the expression of mitomycin C resistance in earlier passages. The feeder regrowth was prevented by identifying a safe subculture protocol that discouraged the inclusion of resistant variants. We advocate routine anchorage-independent growth assay and absolute confirmation of feeder disintegration to qualify <b>feeder</b> <b>batches</b> and caution on the use of fetal bovine serum...|$|R
