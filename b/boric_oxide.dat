2500|$|Trimethoxyboroxine(TMB)liquid is a boron {{compound}} {{dissolved in}} methanol {{to give it}} proper fluidity {{and allow it to}} be discharged from a portable fire extinguisher. It was developed in the late 1950s by the U.S. Navy for use on magnesium fires, especially crashed aircraft and aircraft wheel fires from hard landings. It is unique as an extinguishing agent in that the agent itself is a flammable liquid. When TMB contacts the fire, the methanol ignites and burns with a greenish flame due to the boron.

A 6-inch fluorescent orange band with the letters [...] "TMB" [...] stenciled in black identified TMB from other extinguishers. This agent was problematic in that it had a shelf life of only six months to a year once the extinguisher was filled, since the methanol is extremely hygroscopic (absorbs moisture from the air), which causes corrosion to the extinguisher and renders its use on fire dangerous. These extinguishers were used from the 1950s–70s in various applications, such as the MB-1 and MB-5 crash trucks. The current SOP is to use water fog and cool/burn out the burning metal.|$|E
5000|$|... === Glass {{families}} === For {{the purposes}} of classification, borosilicate glass can be roughly arranged in the following groups, according to their oxide composition (in mass fractions).

The amount of <b>boric</b> <b>oxide</b> affects the glass properties in a particular way. Apart from the highly resistant varieties (B2O3 up to a maximum of 13%), there are others that - due to the different way in which the <b>boric</b> <b>oxide</b> is incorporated into the structural network - have only low chemical resistance (B2O3 content over 15%).

Initially, the authors evaluated laser-beam welding over volatile fluxing agents (ferric <b>oxide,</b> copper <b>oxide,</b> <b>boric</b> acid, and boron nitride). They also examined other laser, arc-welding, brazing, and cold joining techniques. The NZP materials were capable of sustaining the thermal stresses associated with these joining processes without substantial cracking. Of the volatile fluxes, only the copper oxide promoted weld fusion. Efforts to accomplish fusion by laser-beam welding over copper, titanium, stainless steel, yttrium barium copper oxide, fused silica glass, and mullite/alumina were unsuccessful. Gas-tungsten arc welding accompanied by porosity, irregularities, and cracking was achieved on copper sheet sandwiched between NZP tiles. Attempts at conventional oxy-acetylene welding and torch brazing were unproductive.

5000|$|<b>Boric</b> acid, <b>oxides</b> and salts (borates) are {{effective}} wood preservatives and are supplied under numerous brand names throughout the world. One {{of the most}} common compounds used is disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (commonly abbreviated DOT). Borate treated wood is of low toxicity to humans, and does not contain copper or other heavy metals. However, unlike most other preservatives, borate compounds do not become fixed in the wood and can be partially leached out if exposed repeatedly to water that flows away rather than evaporating (evaporation leaves the borate behind so is not a problem). Even though leaching will not normally reduce boron concentrations below effective levels for preventing fungal growth, borates should not be used where they will be exposed to repeated rain, water or ground contact unless the exposed surfaces are treated to repel water. [...] Zinc-borate compounds are less suspectible to leaching than sodium-borate compounds, but are still not recommended for below-ground use unless the timber is first sealed. Recent interest in low toxicity timber for residential use, along with new regulations restricting some wood preservation agents, has resulted in a resurgence of the use of borate treated wood for floor beams and internal structural members. Researchers at CSIRO in Australia have developed organoborates which are much more resistant to leaching, while still providing timber with good protection from termite and fungal attack. The cost of the production of these modified borates will limit their widespread take-up but {{they are likely to be}} suitable for certain niche applications, especially where low mammalian toxicity is of paramount importance.|$|R

Zinc borate samples before and after supercritical drying were characterized by analytical titration, SEM, XRD, TGA, DSC, FTIR, and N 2 adsorption at 77 K. The use of oleic acid as a modifying agent, ultrasonic treatment and nanosized zinc oxide in the reaction of zinc <b>oxide</b> and <b>boric</b> acid did not make significant effect in controlling the particle size. However, particle size of zinc borate produced from borax and zinc nitrate has increased with reaction time. Interaction of zinc borates with CO 2 or ethanol at supercritical conditions or compression of crystals by high pressure created by the expansion of water during freezing are possible side effects of the nanoparticle producing processes. Zinc borate (2 ZnO. 3 B 2 O 3. 7 H 2 O) having water of crystallization in its structure reacted partially with CO 2 to produce zinc carbonate, however zinc borate (2 ZnO. 3 B 2 O 3. 3 H 2 O) containing only hydroxyl groups did not react with CO 2 in supercritical CO 2 drying. While zinc borate (2 ZnO. 3 B 2 O 3. 3 H 2 O) decomposed partially and formed anhydrous zinc borate and zinc oxide, zinc borate (ZnO.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen an {{increasing}} research effort focused on nanoscaling of metal borides, a class of compounds characterized {{by a variety of}} crystal structures and bonding interactions. Despite being subject to an increasing number of studies in the application field, comprehensive studies of the size-dependent structural changes of metal borides are limited. In this work, size-dependent microstructural analysis of the VB 2 nanocrystals prepared by means of a size-controlled colloidal solution synthesis is carried out using X-ray powder diffraction. The,contributions of crystallite size and strain to X-ray line broadening is separated by introducing a modified Williamson-Hall method taking into account different reflection profile shapes. For average crystallite sizes smaller than ca. 20 nm, a remarkable increase of lattice strain is observed together with a significant contraction of the hexagonal lattice decreasing primarily the cell parameter c. Exemplary density-functional theory calculations support this trend. The size-dependent lattice contraction of VB 2 nanoparticles is associated with the decrease of the interatomic boron distances along the c-axis. The larger fraction of constituent atoms at the surface is formed by boron atoms. Accordingly, lattice contraction {{is considered to be a}} surface effect. The anisotropy of the size-dependent lattice contraction in VB 2 nanocrystals is in line with the higher compressibility of its macroscopic bulk structure along the c-axis revealed by theoretical calculations of the respective elastic properties. Transmission electron microscopy indicates that the VB 2 nanocrystals are embedded in an amorphous matrix.

The decomposition temperature:; of schorl in the presence of activated charcoal was found to be at least 60 ^C lower than that for air decomposed schorl.

The similarity between these values and that of 6. 8 kcal/mole for the activation energy oftacTid leaching of phase-separated borosilicate glass (138), was thought to provide further indirect evidence for the suggestion that the amorphous phase in decomposed schorl contains phase separated micro-regions. The rate of extraction of both <b>boric</b> <b>oxide</b> and iron from schorl decomposed in reducing conditions was found to be considerably faster than from air decomposed schorl.

Molar compositions range from n= 4 to n= 1. 3, to which are added minor amounts in varying combinations of alumina, alkali fluorides, <b>boric</b> <b>oxide,</b> alkali oxides, and akaline earth oxides...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} equimolar {{substitution}} of lithium or barium metaphosphate in <b>boric</b> <b>oxide</b> was studied {{on the glass}} transition temperature (Tg) and devitrification behaviour. Hypotheses on the structural units present were inferred from Tgvs. composition curves. The different thermal stabilities of the glasses were roughly evaluated. The devitrification kinetic parameters of LiPO 3 and Ba(PO 3) 2 glasses were evaluated by means of thermoanalytical methods...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the formation and self-lubrication mechanisms of boric acid films on <b>boric</b> <b>oxide</b> coatings prepared by vacuum evaporation. Measured friction coefficients of a steel ball sliding on a boric-oxide-coated steel disk and a sapphire ball sliding on a boric-oxide-coated alumina disk were 0. 025 - 0. 05 at steady state, depending on load and substrate material. This low friction was correlated with the formation of a lubricious boric acid film on <b>boric</b> <b>oxide</b> coatings exposed to open air. For the mechanism of self-lubrication, the layered triclinic crystal structure of boric acid was proposed. The atoms constituting each boric acid molecule are arrayed in closely packed and strongly bonded layers that are 0. 318 nm apart and held together by weak forces, such as van der Waal’s. It is hypothesized that, during sliding, these layers can align themselves parallel to the direction of relative motion and, once so aligned, can slide over one another with relative ease to provide low friction. Structural and chemical findings were included to substantiate the proposed solid lubrication mechanism. 1...|$|E
