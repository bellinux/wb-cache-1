30|$|A set of {{implicit}} {{rules for}} filters connection and validation, are internal and implicitly defined {{as part of}} filter graph within its <b>built-in</b> Intelligent <b>Connector.</b> These rules are also encoded in C++ metaprogramming artifact templates.|$|R
50|$|Although the PC20/PC200 {{does not}} support today's floppy disk drives through the <b>built-in</b> FDD <b>connector,</b> it uses a {{compatible}} floppy disk controller (Zilog Z765a) that can work after modification of the FDD connector, though only with 720k disks.|$|R
40|$|OpenTSDB is a {{fast and}} {{reliable}} database used worldwide. While it has numerous advantages, its current web user interface is simplistic and not interactive, wasting {{the time that}} takes to perform a specific task. This thesis focuses on {{the implementation of a}} more reliable and interactive architecture using a Model, View, Controller architecture while considering visual analytics, NodeJS, websockets, Python, and R. The nodejs server is proposed as a solution. It has four different <b>built-in</b> <b>connectors</b> that obtain and transform data from OpenTSDB. We will show a connector from OpenTSDB to the NodeJS server (nodetsdb), OpenTSDB directly with the client javascript (nodetsdb-client), OpenTSDB to Python, and OpenTSDB with R. After implementing and testing all the connectors we discovered that the connector from OpenTSDB to NodeJS is the fastest one, retrieving one month of data points in less than sixty ms...|$|R
50|$|A {{few years}} later, he was bought a Commodore 64. Soon {{there was a}} {{confluence}} between his gaming obsession his love for sound and music. Influenced by Rob Hubbard and Ben Daglish, Phelan began to write music specifically for games. When he progressed to the Atari ST, Phelan began collecting keyboards and using the ST's <b>built-in</b> MIDI <b>connectors,</b> started to sequence complex arrangements, classical scores as well as audio for high-powered games.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The Octek Jaguar V {{motherboard}} from 1993. This {{board has}} few onboard peripherals, {{as evidenced by}} the 6 slots provided for ISA cards and the lack of other <b>built-in</b> external interface <b>connectors.</b> Note the large AT keyboard connector at the back right is its only peripheral interface.|$|R
25|$|On {{the second}} {{generation}} iPod Shuffle, USB connectivity is provided via an included piece of hardware which acts as a docking station for the transfer of data and the recharging of the iPod's internal battery through its headphone jack. The second generation iPod Shuffle was also able {{to act as a}} flash drive, just like the first generation iPod Shuffle. However, unlike the first generation iPod Shuffle, {{the second generation}} did not have a <b>built-in</b> USB <b>connector.</b> This means that the docking station was required for connection to a computer.|$|R
50|$|Systems {{utilizing}} the DE9 connector for their game port included the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A; Atari 8-bit and ST lines; the Commodore VIC-20, 64, 128, and Amiga; the Amstrad CPC (which employed daisy-chaining when connecting two Amstrad-specific joysticks); the MSX, X68000, and FM-Towns, predominantly used in Japan; the early Sega platforms (e.g. SG-1000, Master System and Mega Drive/Genesis); and the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. The ZX Spectrum lacked a <b>built-in</b> joystick <b>connector</b> {{of any kind}} but aftermarket interfaces provided the ability to connect DE9 joysticks. NEC's home computers (e.g. PC-88, PC-98) also used DE9 connectors for game controllers, depending on the sound card used.|$|R
50|$|The WX5 has a 16-key layout {{similar to}} a {{standard}} saxophone. It also includes a <b>built-in</b> MIDI output <b>connector,</b> a dedicated connector and cable for direct connections to Yamaha WX-Series tone generators, a high-resolution wind sensor, and a thumb-controlled pitch bend wheel. Yamaha recommend that this device be used with the Yamaha VL70m Virtual Acoustic Tone Generator.|$|R
50|$|The last real {{update to}} the Power Mac G4 line was on January 28, 2003 {{offering}} dual 1.42 GHz PowerPC 7455 processors, with features {{not seen in}} previous DDR models: <b>built-in</b> FireWire 800 <b>connector,</b> optional integrated Bluetooth, and optional integrated AirPort Extreme. These were also the first Power Macs that could not boot into Mac OS 9.|$|R
25|$|The Sansa Express is a flash-based {{digital audio}} player in {{capacities}} of 1GB and 2GB. It has a <b>built-in</b> USB <b>connector</b> and a 1.1-inch, duochromatic OLED display, a microSD slot, an FM tuner, a microphone for voice recording, an internal Lithium-Ion battery, and a lanyard {{to wear it}} around the neck. It is also able to record FM radio and voice on its internal memory. This player is not considered as a descendant of the c200 series, as it only plays audio. It is more similar to the m200 series and maintains much of its design and internal software structure. It is the world's first known cable-less flash-based digital audio player, though a USB cable {{is included in the}} package if one is required to be used.|$|R
50|$|The Samsung Galaxy S III, {{and later}} Galaxy Note II and Galaxy S4, use an 11-pin {{connector}} {{and the six}} additional connector pins {{in order to achieve}} functional improvements over the 5-pin design (like simultaneous USB-OTG use). However, if consumers have a standard MHL-to-HDMI adapter all they need to purchase is a tip. With the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S4, Samsung also released a Samsung 2.0 smart adapter with a <b>built-in</b> 11-pin <b>connector.</b> The first generation Samsung MHL 2.0 smart adapter released with the Galaxy S III requires external power and is able to work with HDMI TVs at 1080p at 24 Hz. The second generation adapter released with the Galaxy S4 can output 1080p at 60 Hz and does not need external power.|$|R
25|$|At {{one time}} three-pin XLR {{connectors}} {{were also used}} extensively on loudspeaker cables, as when first introduced they represented a new standard of ruggedness, and economic alternatives were not readily available. Often, two-conductor loudspeaker cable had three-pin female connectors on both ends, to distinguish it from a three-conductor shielded signal level cable, which has a female connector {{at one end and}} a male at the other. Either pin 2 or 3 was live, depending on the manufacturer, with pin 1 always the 'earthy' return. This usage is now both obsolete and dangerous to equipment but is still sometimes encountered, especially on older equipment. For example, some loudspeakers have a <b>built-in</b> male <b>connector</b> as an input connector for speaker-level signal. This use was superseded in professional audio applications by the Neutrik Speakon connector.|$|R

50|$|Poken is a modular, {{end-to-end}} platform, {{consisting of}} both {{software and hardware}} products. The Poken interactive USB device utilizes Near Field Communication (NFC) technology to allow the exchange of online social networking data between two devices. The primary information exchanged via the poken is a ‘social business card’, a digital replacement for a physical business card. By touching two devices together, a unique ID is exchanged that links to contact information on the Poken website. Contact information acquired by use of the poken can be uploaded to the poken website using a <b>built-in</b> USB <b>connector.</b> The user's poken contact card can contain any information they want to share, for example URLs, mobile number, email address, and location. It can also be configured with links to the user on over 40 social networking sites.|$|R
5000|$|The DMS-59 {{connector}} {{is used by}} AMD (AMD FireMV), Nvidia and Matrox {{for video}} cards sold in Lenovo Thinkcentres, Viglen Genies and Omninos, Dell, and HP computers. DMS-59 connectors also appeared on Sun Computers. Some confusion has been caused {{by the fact that}} vendors label cards with DMS-59 as [...] "supports DVI", but the cards have no DVI <b>connectors</b> <b>built-in.</b> Such cards, when equipped with only a VGA connector adapter cable, cannot be connected to a monitor with only a DVI-D input. A DMS-59 to DVI adapter cable needs to be used with such monitors.|$|R
40|$|CAPP Terminal Device, Size # 2 for teenaged {{and adult}} amputees offers an {{alternative}} to hooks and hands available today. CAPP T D 2 {{is intended to be}} pleasing in appearance; it blends with the forearm in shape, colour and material to give a continuous flowing natural look. It was designed to provide secure grip through the combined action of a closing spring, a full frictional, resilient cover and a n automatic lock. The lock operates as part of the voluntary opening control system and requires no conscious action by the amputee. CAPP T D 2 is a general purpose terminal device which especially serves unilateral amputees by performing functions usually carried out by the non-dominant hand. CAPP TD 2 comes with a <b>built-in</b> wrist <b>connector</b> which is available in two models; both offer quick disconnect. One wrist unit has adjustable friction and the other attaches to an existing friction wrist unit so CAPP T D 2 can be applied to an existing prosthesis. Ten patients have completed the evaluation programme with promising results. Prototypes of CAPP T D 2 are available for patients interested in evaluating it...|$|R
