40|$|Mixed-model <b>assembly</b> <b>lines</b> {{are widely}} used {{in a range of}} {{production}} settings, such as the final assembly of the automotive and electronics industries, where they are applied to mass-produce standardised commodities. One of the greatest challenges when installing and reconfiguring these lines is the vast product variety modern mixed-model <b>assembly</b> <b>lines</b> have to cope with. Traditionally, product variety is bypassed during mid-term <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing by applying a joint precedence graph, which represents an (artificial) average model and serves as the input data for a single model <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing procedure. However, this procedure might lead to considerable variations in the station times, so that serious sequencing problems emerge and work overload threatens. To avoid these difficulties, different extensions of <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing for workload smoothing, i. e. horizontal balancing, have been introduced in the literature. This paper presents a multitude of known and yet unknown objectives for workload smoothing and systematically tests these measures in a comprehensive computational study. The results suggest that workload smoothing is an essential task in mixed-model <b>assembly</b> <b>lines</b> and that some (of the newly introduced) objectives are superior to others.

40|$|<b>Assembly</b> <b>Line</b> {{balancing}} (ALB) problems {{deal with}} the allocation of the tasks among workstations {{such a way that}} the precedence relations are not violated and a given objective function is optimized. It is a fundamental problem in continuous production line, and it is one of the difficult optimization problems. Installing <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> is a long-term decision and required high capital investments. Hence, it is very important to design the <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> and balance the workload on the workstations. The <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> has to be rebalanced periodically or if there is a change in the production plan or process. Based on the strategic goals of the manufacturers, the performance measures have to be carefully chosen, since balancing decisions have a long term effect. Due to the technological advancements, human workforce is replaced by robots to perform the tasks in an <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> Different robots with different capacity and specialization are available to perform the assembly task, hence it is required to choose the best fit robot among the available robots such a way that it helps in improving the productivity of the <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> Robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing (RALB) problem aims at assigning the tasks to workstation and allocate robot for each workstation in {{such a way that the}} productivity is improved. Very few researchers have proposed models for balancing a robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> The main objective of this research is to develop efficient algorithms to solve robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing problems. RALB problem is NP-hard, since the basic version of <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing problems falls under this category. To solve problem of this nature it is necessary to use metaheuristic algorithms. RALB problems with different objective functions are proposed and solved. The objectives considered for the RALB study are: minimizing cycle time, minimizing energy consumption, minimizing <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> cost and maximizing line efficiency of a robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> Straight and U-shaped RALB problems are considered. The results obtained for the two <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> problems are compared. RALB problem with an objective of minimizing cycle time is solved using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and hybrid models of PSO and efficient metaheuristics. Two allocation procedures are used for allocating tasks and robots in the <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> PSO and its variants are the metaheuristics proposed to solve the RALB problem. PSO is also hybridized with Genetic Algorithm and Cuckoo search to solve RALB problem. Proposed algorithms are able to produce better results when compared with the benchmark results reported in the literature. Manufacturing industries give importance to the reduction of energy consumption due to the increase in energy cost and to create an eco-friendly environment. Due to the importance of reducing energy consumption in an <b>assembly</b> <b>line,</b> an energy based RALB problem is proposed. RALB problem with an objective of minimizing energy consumption for straight and U-shaped robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> is proposed. Particle swarm optimization algorithm is the metaheuristic used to solve the proposed model. Cost reduction is one of the important tasks for the manufacturing companies throughout the world. In this thesis, a cost based RALB problem is also proposed. The objective considered in this problem is to minimize the <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> cost. Particle swarm optimization and Differential evolution algorithms are proposed to solve the problem. Straight and U-shaped robotic <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> problems are solved using the proposed algorithms and the results obtained are presented Since the investment in <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> is high, industries try to maximize their usage in the shortest time possible. Maximizing the line efficiency is another measure considered in this thesis. Particle swarm optimization and Differential evolution algorithms are proposed to solve this RALB problem.
