40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of brushing with a Colgate 360 ° or Oral <b>B</b> <b>Indicator</b> 35 toothbrush on the shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets bonded to extracted human teeth. The bristle wear and bristle tip morphology were also examined after simulated tooth-brushing. Orthodontic brackets (Roth-P/ 1 st and 2 nd pre-molar S/D- Slot 0. 18) were bonded (Transbond XT ®) to the smoothest surface of each of 45 extracted human molar and premolar teeth. Test specimens were randomly divided into three groups: Group 1, control group with no brushing; Group 2, brushing with the Oral <b>B</b> <b>Indicator</b> 35; Group 3, brushing with the Colgate 360 °. Samples were adapted to a machine that simulated tooth-brushing. The bond strength of each bracket to each tooth was assessed with a mechanical testing machine. The bristle wear and bristle tip morphology indices were also assessed. Statistically significant differences were defined for p ≤ 0. 05. The average bond strengths (range: 90. 18 - 90. 89 kgf/cm 2) did not differ among the three groups. The Colgate 360 ° showed less bristle wear and a better bristle tip morphology than the Oral <b>B</b> <b>Indicator</b> 35 toothbrush. However, use of either toothbrush did not decrease the bond strength of the orthodontic brackets. Therefore, patients undergoing orthodontic therapy can safely use either toothbrush...|$|R

5000|$|The {{primary means}} of {{establishing}} the heading in most small aircraft is the magnetic compass, which, however, suffers from several types of errors, including that created by the [...] "dip" [...] or downward slope of the Earth's magnetic field. Dip error causes the magnetic compass to read incorrectly whenever the aircraft is in a bank, or during acceleration or deceleration, {{making it difficult to}} use in any flight condition other than unaccelerated, perfectly straight and level. To remedy this, the pilot will typically manoeuvre the airplane with reference to the <b>heading</b> <b>indicator,</b> as the gyroscopic <b>heading</b> <b>indicator</b> is unaffected by dip and acceleration errors. The pilot will periodically reset the <b>heading</b> <b>indicator</b> to the <b>heading</b> shown on the magnetic compass.|$|R
