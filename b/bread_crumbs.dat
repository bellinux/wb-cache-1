5|$|One of {{the most}} common {{constituents}} of a medieval meal, either as part of a banquet or as a small snack, were sops, pieces of bread with which a liquid like wine, soup, broth, or sauce could be soaked up and eaten. Another common sight at the medieval dinner table was the frumenty, a thick wheat porridge often boiled in a meat broth and seasoned with spices. Porridges were also made of every type of grain and could be served as desserts or dishes for the sick, if boiled in milk (or almond milk) and sweetened with sugar. Pies filled with meats, eggs, vegetables, or fruit were common throughout Europe, as were turnovers, fritters, doughnuts, and many similar pastries. By the Late Middle Ages biscuits (cookies in the U.S.) and especially wafers, eaten for dessert, had become high-prestige foods and came in many varieties. Grain, either as <b>bread</b> <b>crumbs</b> or flour, was also the most common thickener of soups and stews, alone or in combination with almond milk.|$|E

40|$|Texture {{analysis}} is an objective physical examination of baked products and gives direct {{information on the}} product quality, oppositely to dough rheology tests what inform on the baking suitability of the flour, as raw material. Evaluation of the mechanical properties of <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> is important not only for quality assurance in the bakeries, but also for assessing the effects of changes in dough ingredients and processing condition and also for describing the changes in <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> during storage. Crumb cellular structure is an important quality criterion used in commercial baking and research laboratories to judge bread quality alongside taste, crumb colour and crumb physical texture. In the framework of our research during the years 2010 – 2011 were analyzed selected indicators of <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> for texture quality of three Triticum spelta L. cultivars – Altgold, Rubiota and Ostro grown in an ecological system.

Inclusion of an antifirming maltogenic exo-amylase in the recipe altered neither bread density, nor its macroscopic cellular structure parameters, but strongly affected the impact of storage on crumb texture. It was concluded that, without affecting starch properties or moisture content, the bread density, which is inter alia related to gluten properties, is a major determinant of <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> structure and texture during storage.

500|$|With [...] "Human Stupidity", Creangă {{builds a}} fable about {{incompetence}} in its absolute forms. The story {{centers on a}} peasant's quest {{to find people who}} are less rational than his wife, having been infuriated by her panic at the remote possibility that a ball of salt could fall from its place of storage and kill their baby. This, essayist and chronicler Simona Vasilache argues, highlights [...] "a family-based division" [...] of illogical behavior, in which women are depicted as the main propagators of both [...] "astonishing nonsense" [...] and [...] "prudent stupidity". Instead, literary critic Ion Pecie identified inside the narrative a meditation on [...] "the link between spirit and nature", with the unpredictable ball of salt representing the equivalent of a [...] "sphinx". His colleague Gheorghe Grigurcu argued that such conclusions [...] "may seem excessive", but that they were ultimately validated by the literary work being [...] "a plurality of levels". A similar piece is the prose fable [...] "The Story of a Lazy Man": fed up with the protagonist's proverbial indolence, which has led him as far as to view chewing food as an effort, his fellow villagers organize a lynching. This upsets the sensibility of a noblewoman who happens to witness the incident. When she offers to take the lazy man into her care and feed him <b>bread</b> <b>crumbs,</b> he seals his own fate by asking: [...] "But are your <b>bread</b> <b>crumbs</b> soft?" [...] The peculiar effect of this moral is underlined by Anghelescu: [...] "The lazy man dies as a martyr of his own immobility." [...] Braga interpreted the story as evidence of [...] "the primacy of ethics" [...] over social aspects in the local tradition. Ion Pecie saw in the story proof of Creangă's own support for capital punishment with a preventive or didactic purpose, even in cases were the fault was trivial or imagined, concluding: [...] "Here,... Creangă loses much of his depth." [...] Pecie's conclusion was treated with reserve by Grigurcu, who believed that, instead, the narrator refrains from passing any judgment on [...] "the community's instinctual eugenic reaction".|$|E

40|$|Abstract The bread {{quality is}} {{considerably}} {{dependent on the}} texture characteristic of <b>bread</b> <b>crumb.</b> Crumb texture is an important quality indicator, as consumer prefer different bread taste. Texture analysis is primarily concerned with the evaluation of mechanical characteristics where a material is subjected to a controlled force from which a deformation curve of its response is generated. It is an objective physical examination of baked products and gives direct information on the product quality, oppositely to dough rheology tests what inform on the baking suitability of the flour, as raw material. This is why the texture analysis {{is one of the}} most helpful analytical methods of the product development. In the framework of our research during the years 2008 – 2009 were analyzed selected indicators for bread texture quality of five Triticum spelta L. varieties – Altgold, Oberkulmer Rotkorn, Ostro, Rubiota and Franckenkorn grown in an ecological system. The bread texture quality was evaluated on texture analyzer TA. XT Plus (Stable Micro Systems, Surrey, UK), following the AACC (74 - 09) standard method and expressed as crumb firmness (N), stiffness (N. mm- 1) and relative elasticity (%). Our research proved that all selected indicators were significantly influenced by the year of growing and variety. The most soft bread was achieved in Rubiota, whereas <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> samples from Franckenkorn and Altgold were the most firm and stiff. Correlation analysis showed strong negative correlation between relative elasticity and <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> firmness as well as bread stiffness (- 0. 81 ++, - 0. 78 ++). The spelt grain can be a good source for making bread flour, but is closely dependent on choice of spelt variety.
