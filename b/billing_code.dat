5000|$|Weisberg's Medical Analytical Laboratories {{received}} nearly $175,000 in Medi-Cal payments, with $88,000 {{coming from}} pathology tests on aborted fetuses. Of this, {{half of it}} ($44,000) was paid federally through the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). By the Hyde Amendment, this money was ineligible for testing on pre-abortion or post-abortion tissue, which meant the state of California would need to pay back federal funds claimed by Weisberg and by any other laboratories, according to HHS inspector Richard P. Kusserow. Kusserow also stated [...] "prior to its closing in April, 1981, Analytical Laboratories had routinely submitted questionable billings under the Medi-Cal program, using an erroneous <b>billing</b> <b>code....</b> the case lacked criminal prosecutive merit {{due to a lack}} of proof that the false billings were intentional.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Data on {{administrative}} prevalence, types {{of treatment and}} disease costs of patients diagnosed with somatoform pain disorder (according to ICD 10) in Germany were not previously available. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed health insurance data from 2008 - 2010 of 8. 5  million people of the German statutory health insurance company BARMER GEK {{on administrative}} prevalence of insurants {{with at least one}} <b>billing</b> <b>code</b> F 45. 4 x in 2009 and at least one second <b>billing</b> <b>code</b> F 45. 4 x in the time period 2008 - 2010 stratified by age and gender, different professions being involved in treatment, diagnostics and treatment methods applied. The types and costs of out-patient treatment and of in-patient treatment in case of any discharge with diagnosis of F 45. 4 were analysed. RESULTS: The administrative prevalence doubled from 2008 to 2010 after the separation of the previous code F 45. 4 into F 45. 40 and F 45. 41. In 2009, 0. 5 [*]...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The medical {{community}} is {{shocked by the}} complexity of the documentation now required to support the Medicare billing codes. This situation represents an opportunity for Electronic Medical Records that use discrete data to become a central factor at the point of care by fulfilling these stringent documentation specifications. METHODS: This empirical study explores whether a discrete data EMR has the ability to generate automatically a report describing what <b>billing</b> <b>code</b> is consistent with the documentation recorded. We tested this hypothesis on HBOC Pathways SMR by attempting to create algorithms that reflected the HCFA guidelines. We validated this process using historical records from the Cleveland Clinic. RESULTS: All the data elements required by HCFA were available as discrete data. Using algorithms, the <b>billing</b> <b>code</b> consistent with the documentation of the health care encounter could be automatically generated. CONCLUSIONS: EMRs using discrete data can substantially reduce the burden placed on health care providers by HCFA's new documentation guidelines. This benefit creates a window of opportunity for health informatics to become an integral tool in the provision of health care. Using EMRs for billing purposes can help achieve the loftier goal of using EMRs for quality improvement...|$|E

30|$|An itemized bill of {{individual}} charges for each patient {{was obtained from}} the hospital billing office and was organized by <b>billing</b> <b>code</b> into the following categories: room/board, pharmacy, supplies, laboratory, radiology, surgical (including procedures performed under general anesthesia), blood products, respiratory services, dialysis, and miscellaneous (which included some professional fees, nonsurgical procedures and phlebotomy, and diagnostics not included in the other categories, such as electroencephalograms, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, cardiac catheterizations, and vascular studies). The values represent the hospital charges for the aforementioned services rather than the actual reimbursement, which may be subject to more variability.

We attempted to determine the incidence of bilateral intervention by searching the PHIS database for either the <b>billing</b> <b>code</b> appearing twice on a particular patient record or by the CPT modifier code 50.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundIdentifying {{patients}} with atrial fibrillation (AF) using administrative data {{is important for}} epidemiologic and outcomes research. Although administrative data cover large populations, {{it is necessary to}} assess their validity in identifying AF patients. MethodsWe used Ontario family physician electronic medical records from the Electronic Medical Record Administrative data Linked Database (EMRALD) as a reference standard to assess the accuracy of administrative data algorithms in identifying {{patients with}} AF. From a random sample of 7500 adult patients, patients with AF as recorded in family physician records were identified. ResultsThe optimal algorithm consisted of any of: hospitalization or an emergency room code for AF or prescription for an AF-specific antiarrhythmic agent or <b>billing</b> <b>code</b> for cardioversion, or prescription for an anticoagulant that was accompanied by a physician <b>billing</b> <b>code.</b> for arrhythmia. The algorithm sensitivity was 80. 7 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 75. 1 - 86. 3), specificity 99. 1 % (95 % CI, 98. 9 - 99. 3), positive predictive value 71. 1 % (95 % CI, 65. 1 - 77. 1), and negative predictive value 99. 5 % (95 % CI, 99. 3 - 99. 7). This algorithm, applied to the Ontario population, resulted in a calculated increase in AF prevalence from 1. 68 % to 2. 36 % over the years 2000 - 2014. Anticoagulation rates for AF patients increased from 53 % in 2011 to 60 % in 2014. Among AF patients receiving anticoagulants, novel oral anticoagulant utilization increased from 50 % in  2014. ConclusionsIdentifying patients with AF can be done using administrative data, and the algorithm can be used to assess trends in disease burden over time and patterns of care in large populations...|$|E

40|$|The inverse {{probability}} weighting (IPW) estimator {{is widely used}} to estimate the treatment effect in observational studies in which patient characteristics might not be balanced by treatment group. The estimator assumes that treatment assignment, is error-free, but in reality treatment assignment can be measured with error. This arises {{in the context of}} comparative effectiveness research, using administrative data sources in which accurate procedural or <b>billing</b> <b>codes</b> are not always available. We show the bias introduced to the estimator when using error-prone treatment assignment, and propose an adjusted estimator using a validation study to eliminate this bias. In simulations, we explore the impact of the misclassified treatment assignment on the estimator, and compare the performance of our adjusted estimator to an estimate based only on the validation study. We illustrate our method on a comparative effectiveness study assessing surgical treatments among Medicare beneficiaries, diagnosed with brain tumors. We use linked SEER-Medicare data as our validation data, and apply our method to Medicare Part A hospital claims data where treatment is based on ICD 9 <b>billing</b> <b>codes,</b> which do not accurately reflect surgical treatment...|$|R
