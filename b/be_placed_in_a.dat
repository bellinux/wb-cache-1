5|$|When the African river {{martin was}} first {{discovered}} in the 19th century, Gustav Hartlaub {{thought it was a}} roller, and later authors either placed it in its own family, or with the woodswallows. Study of the anatomy revealed that the species was closest to the swallows and martins, but that it possessed a number of distinctive features, such as its robust legs and feet and stout bill. These indicated that it should <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> separate subfamily. The two river martin species are usually considered to belong to a single genus, Pseudochelidon, due to their having a number of structural similarities. However, Brooke proposed that the white-eyed river martin <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> separate monotypic genus Eurochelidon.|$|E

5|$|For {{greatest}} {{efficiency and}} best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers can <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{corner of the}} room, far from large room openings, {{and closer to the}} listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel is out of phase with another.|$|E

5|$|In a {{molecular}} analysis of Boletaceae phylogeny, the brawny bolete was most {{closely related to}} Boletus luteocupreus; these two species formed a clade that was sister to B.luridus. Genetic analysis published in 2013 showed that B.torosus and many (but not all) red-pored boletes {{were part of a}} dupainii clade (named for B.dupainii), well-removed from the core group of Boletus edulis (the type species of genus Boletus) and relatives within the Boletineae. This indicated that the brawny bolete and its relatives needed to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new genus. It was made the type species of the new genus Imperator, becoming Imperator torosus, in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Rasmussen {{was also}} {{involved}} {{in a review of}} fossil birds from Miocene and Pliocene deposits in North Carolina. Finds included an early Miocene loon Colymboides minutus, various ducks, a crested tern closely resembling the modern royal tern Sterna maxima, {{and a member of the}} crow genus, one of the few fossil passerine birds from that period. The review found that fossil birds from this period generally closely resemble a modern species or genus, and those that do not can usually <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> modern family with a fair degree of confidence.|$|E

To help the tissue bond, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle; the bindings are usually loosened after a week and removed after two to six weeks. If the remaining hole is too large {{in the view of}} the girl's family, the procedure is repeated.|$|E

5|$|When a {{specimen}} of the African river martin from Gabon was first formally described by German zoologist Gustav Hartlaub in 1861, {{it was not}} initially identified {{as a member of}} the swallow and martin family. Hartlaub placed it with the rollers, and later authors either put it in its own separate family, or with the woodswallows. It was only following study of the anatomy of the species by Lowe that it was determined to be closely related to the swallows and martins, but sufficiently different that it could <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> separate subfamily Pseudochelidoninae.|$|E
5|$|While a great {{solution}} for the actors' performances the technique presented enormous VFX challenges: relighting shots captured in a tall white tube to match the sky over the Bolivian desert, and the impossibility of filming medium to wide shots of the actors. An array of eight Dalsa Origin cameras (supported by seven HD cameras and a 35mm hand-held camera, all running in sync) was {{used to create a}} virtual camera with which to shoot the actors floating in the simulator. Ged Wright and his team at Double Negative developed a method to use the data from these cameras that allowed these real performances to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> synthetic environment as seen by a synthetic camera.|$|E

5|$|All {{species are}} predators and scavengers. Iridomyrmex ants tend to many Hemiptera insects and {{butterfly}} larvae to receive honeydew. Workers forage and scavenge for small insects, and they collect nectar from flowers and hunt for prey. Iridomyrmex ants normally forage on the ground, but most species will forage up into trees and vegetation {{to look for}} food. Most ants are diurnal foragers, but some are nocturnal. These nocturnal ants will sometimes become active during the day, but this depends on the suitability of the weather. They will also block their entrance holes when it is daytime; however, I. bigi is nocturnal and never comes out during the day. In a few species, a nest will not <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shaded area; this is so it can warm up during the early mornings and workers can forage shortly after sunrise.|$|E
5|$|In Polish heraldry, the {{tincture}} of {{the charge}} has priority {{in relation to the}} tincture of the field. In the case of Polish national colors, white, the color of the White Eagle, should always <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more honorable position than red, the color of the field of the Polish coat of arms. In the most usual, horizontal alignment, this means that the white stripe is placed above the red one. If the alignment is vertical, the white stripe should be on the left from the onlooker's point of view. If the flag is hung vertically above a street, the white stripe should be placed on the left when looking in the direction of increasing house numbers. If it drapes a coffin, the white stripe should be placed over the heart.|$|E
5|$|The {{age of the}} Santa Rosa fauna remains highly uncertain, as the outcrop {{where the}} fossils were found cannot easily <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> known stratigraphical unit, and the fossils are so {{distinct}} from other known fossil faunas that biostratigraphy cannot provide a precise estimate. In {{a summary of the}} 2004 volume, Kenneth Campbell tentatively referred Santa Rosa to the Mustersan South American Land Mammal Age (SALMA), which he placed near the Eocene–Oligocene boundary, around 35 million years ago. However, Mario Vucetich and colleagues suggested in 2010 that the Santa Rosa fauna may be substantially later—perhaps as young as the Deseadan SALMA (late Oligocene, around 25 million years ago). According to Campbell, the Santa Rosa mammals likely lived in a savanna habitat that contained rivers.|$|E

5|$|The program used import {{subsidies}} to pump US {{dollars into the}} South Vietnamese treasury. The regimes sold these dollars to business people who held licenses to import American goods. The businessmen bought the US dollars from the Saigon treasury with their South Vietnamese piasters at half the official exchange rate; they then used this cheaply acquired American currency to import US goods. This meant that American manufacturers would still get {{the same amount of}} US currency they would have received for selling their goods on the free market, while South Vietnamese importers could get twice as much goods for the same money. The piasters that the Saigon government collected from selling the US aid dollars were to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fund held by the National Bank of Vietnam, which was to be used to fund the expansion and training of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, national police and civil service.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater was {{classified}} in the genera Meliphaga and then Lichenostomus until 2011. Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus using dense taxon and nucleotide sampling confirmed previous findings that Lichenostomus is not monophyletic. While five species have previously been described as comprising the Caligavis subgroup, studies using the mitochondrial DNA identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most {{closely related to the}} black-throated honeyeater (C. subfrenatus) and the obscure honeyeater (C. obscurus) of New Guinea; they were therefore grouped into the genus Caligavis. The bridled honeyeater (B. frenatus) and the Eungella honeyeater (B. hindwoodi) were sufficiently different to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> separate genus as Bolemoreus. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestor of the yellow-faced honeyeater diverged from the common ancestor of the other two Caligavis species around seven million years ago.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 13 May General Winkelman advised the Dutch {{government}} that he considered the general situation to be critical. On land the Dutch had been {{cut off from the}} Allied front and it had become clear no major Allied landings were to be expected to reinforce the Fortress Holland by sea; without such support there was no prospect of a prolonged successful resistance. German tanks might quickly pass through Rotterdam; Winkelman had already ordered all available antitank-guns to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> perimeter around The Hague, to protect the seat of government. However, an immediate collapse of the Dutch defences might still be prevented if the planned counterattacks could seal off the southern front near Dordrecht and restore the eastern line at the Grebbeberg. Therefore, the cabinet decided to continue the fight for the time being, giving the general the mandate to surrender the Army when he saw fit and the instruction to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Nevertheless, it was also deemed essential that Queen Wilhelmina was to be brought to safety; she departed around noon from Hoek van Holland, where a British Irish Guards battalion was present, on HMS Hereward, a British destroyer, and when sea mines made it too dangerous to try to reach Zealand, she went to England. The previous evening, the Queen's only child and heir presumptive Princess Juliana, together with her husband Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld and their children, had departed from IJmuiden on HMS Codrington for Harwich. Arrangements for the departure had already been made before the invasion. As the Queen constitutionally was part of the government, her departure confronted the cabinet with the choice whether to follow her or remain. After heated discussions it was decided to leave also: the ministers sailed at 19:20 from Hoek van Holland on HMS Windsor to form a government in exile in London, having conferred all governmental authority over the homeland to Winkelman. Three Dutch merchant ships, escorted by British warships, transferred government bullion and diamond stocks to the United Kingdom.|$|E
