5000|$|The Clarksville Elementary School in Clarksville, New York, {{also known}} as Clarksville Grade School, is a Modern Movement-style {{building}} built in 1949. The design by Henry L. Blatner. Harry Blatner was an architectural success that was featured in nationwide publications and led to much change in how schools were designed. The application of <b>bilateral</b> <b>lighting</b> was one innovation. [...] The school was closed after the 2010-11 school year. It is currently home to the Albany County Sheriff’s Uniform Patrol Division.|$|E
40|$|The {{photosynthesis}} {{and productivity}} of Lemna gibba is analyzed for CELSS based plant growth. Net photosynthesis of Lemna gibba is determined {{as a function}} of incident photosynthetic photon flux (PPF), with the light coming from above, below, or from both directions. Light from below is about 75 percent as effective as from above when the stand is sparse, but much less so with dense stands. High rates of photosynthesis are measured at 750 micromol / sq m per sec PPF and 1500 micromol/ mol CO 2 at densities up to 660 g fresh weight (FW) / sq m with young cultures. The analysis includes diagrams illustrating the net photosynthesis response to <b>bilateral</b> <b>lighting</b> of a sparse stand of low assimilate Lemna gibba; the effect of stand density on the net photosynthesis response to <b>bilateral</b> <b>lighting</b> of high assimilate Lemna gibba; the net photosynthesis response to ambient CO 2 of sparse stands of Lemna gibba; and the time course of net photosynthesis and respiration per unit chamber and per unit dry weight of Lemna gibba...|$|E
40|$|From {{the post-war}} period onwards school {{buildings}} constituted a great {{training ground for}} the formation, practice and comparison of Swiss architecture. Since {{the end of the}} 1950 s, after the achievement of square classrooms, <b>bilateral</b> <b>lighting,</b> cross ventilation and movable furniture, one of the main points of discussion was the integration between school and leisure time: pedagogues, sociologists and architects militated all in favour of the principle of school as an open house. The use of school premises by the community at large, for sports events, meetings, theatre, hobbies - already frequent in rural localities and in other countries - involved social, economical and pedagogical issues. The reduction of working hours and the consequent extension of free time increased the need of community centres, which were considered {{one of the best ways}} to prevent the dual peril of modern urban society: the isolation of individuals or their annihilation in the anonymous mass. Due to the lack of space in the cities and to the increase of land prices, the creation of leisure facilities for different age ranges was not possible. Starting from these premises the foundation Pro Juventute, together with the municipality of Zurich, created the concept of a ‘Recreation Centre for People of All Ages'. Beyond some independent community centres, the idea of recreation facilities integrated in schools began to catch on. The school building, while retaining its proper functions, could offer ample premises for community purposes and could thus become the school not only of the child but also of the whole man. Architectural form and urban location of the school conceived as a living and active neighbourhood centre should be rethought in new ways. Supplementary recreation facilities had not to encroach on school functions and vice versa. Aim of the present paper is to explain how the idea of an open school influenced during the 1950 s and the 1960 s the design of school buildings and to show how leisure activities and consequently recreation centres are conceived mainly as pedagogical issue...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bilateral</b> <b>light</b> {{adaptation}} of distal retinal shielding pigments was observed {{a few minutes}} after 60 min of sustained photic stimulation (2 - 69 Cd/m 2) of a single eyestalk of the dark-adapted crayfish. Pigment migration was ob-served in intact animals as a diminution of eye glow area and electroretino-gram amplitude, and was confirmed in sectioned material. The effect upon the contralateral eye was abolished by surgical bisection of the cerebral ganglion. It is suggested that the mechanism involved in the bilateral effect may be responsible for the mutual entrainment of ERG circadian rhythms of both eyes...|$|R

He presented with anisocoria, prompt <b>bilateral</b> pupillary <b>light</b> reaction, and unilateral convergence paralysis contralateral to the lesion in combination with upward gaze palsy. During an observation period of two months, the convergence reaction returned to normal. MRI showed a lacunar lesion ventral to superior right colliculus.

40|$|AbstractA 63 -year-old Taiwanese {{man with}} a history of {{cutaneous}} melanoma presented with a rapid onset of <b>bilateral</b> shimmering <b>light</b> and blurred vision. A fundoscopic examination was normal. However, visual field examination indicated generalized depression in both eyes. Scotopic rod-specific electroretinography (ERG) was undetectable and scotopic maximal combined-cone and rod-specific ERG showed the characteristics of negative ERG (a normal a-wave and a diminished b-wave, with the b-wave smaller than the a-wave), indicating dysfunction of the bipolar cells. Melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR) was suspected and a systemic work-up gave a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma. This case shows the typical presentation of MAR. Greater awareness of MAR in patients with unexplained visual loss may help to identify an occult focus of metastatic melanoma...|$|R

40|$|Photon tracing {{and density}} {{estimation}} are well established techniques in global illumination computation and rendering of high-quality animation sequences. Using traditional density estimation techniques {{it is difficult}} to remove stochastic noise inherent for photon-based methods while avoiding overblurring lighting details. In this paper we investigate the use of <b>bilateral</b> filtering for <b>lighting</b> reconstruction based on the local density of photon hit points. Bilateral filtering is applied in spatio-temporal domain and provides control over the level-of-details in reconstructed lighting. All changes of lighting below this level are treated as stochastic noise and are suppressed. Bilateral filtering proves to be efficient in preserving sharp features in lighting which is in particular important for high-quality caustic reconstruction. Also, flickering between subsequent animation frames is substantially reduced due to extending bilateral filtering into temporal domain. 1...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{globalization}} is increasing {{the cooperation of}} states in the international marketplace. Labour mobility is a key area that has proven difficult to liberalize due to its complex nature and sovereign border controls. As a proponent of free trade Canada has sought to establish the rules of trade in multilateral agreements though more recently has turned to bilateral agreements. However, the proliferation of bilateral agreements is seen by economic scholars to frustrate the more efficient multilateral agreements. Comparing the technical language within various agreements reveals that a consistent trend to deepen Canada’s commitments in bilateral arrangements is not found. Rather, bilateral agreements have served to broaden trade globally. This finding suggests that bilateral trade agreements do not complicate the liberalization process to the extent proposed by multilateralists. In this <b>light,</b> <b>bilateral</b> agreements are considered to support Canada’s multilateral objectives by acting as building blocks and creating new trade partners...|$|R
30|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} challenges for physicians caring for patients that are resuscitated after cardiac arrest is providing accurate prognostic information regarding neurologic recovery. A combination of clinical, electrophysiological, and biochemical findings can help predict catastrophic outcomes (e.g., death or persistent vegetative state [1]). For example, <b>bilateral</b> absent pupillary <b>light</b> responses and corneal reflexes have false positive rates of 0.2 and 0.4  %, respectively, for predicting poor neurological recovery. However, it is common for survivors of cardiac arrest to remain comatose, but with present brainstem reflexes. For this cohort of patients, prognosis is particularly difficult, as neurological recovery can lie anywhere on the spectrum from normal to persistent vegetative state. Elevated serum levels of neuron-specific enolase have been found by some researchers to be a reliable indicator of poor neurological recovery [2], but not others [3, 4]. Therefore, the identification of novel serological biomarkers may facilitate accurate prognosis for these patients.|$|R
40|$|The “exportation” of {{security}} {{has become a}} core component of Colombia’s foreign policy. Although the cooperation provided for third parties {{is a result of}} the country’s strategy to increase its own regional and international visibility, much of it is the result of triangulation with the United States. The main objective of the article is to critically question this new model of <b>bilateral</b> interaction in <b>light</b> of the conceptual literature on asymmetrical international relations, which gravitates around the degrees of dependency, submission, penetration, reciprocity and autonomy that exist between states with marked power differentials. We argue that in situations characterized by asymmetry, a more autonomous form of behavior on the part of the weak country does not necessarily clash with being dependent on the strong one. However, the article concludes that the “associated dependent cooperation” that exists between Colombia and the United States, although it seems to configure a more strategic and less subordinate bilateral relationship, is not free of contradictions...|$|R
40|$|Methanol is a toxin {{with rare}} but serious {{effects on the}} central nervous system. It may cause severe visual {{dysfunction}} and mortality. This study presents {{the case of a}} 44 -year-old man admitted to our clinic with bilateral amaurosis which developed after dental intervention for gingivitis. The patient was conscious and presented with stomach ache, nausea, vomiting, weakness, imbalance, and bilateral amaurosis; methanol poisoning was diagnosed. Upon examination, the absence of light perception in the eye and <b>bilateral</b> weakness in <b>light</b> reflexes were detected. Visually-evoked potentials (P 100) could not be obtained. Hyper-intense lesions with bilateral putaminal localisation were observed on magnetic resonance imaging and bilateral pupil oedema was observed by fundus photography. The patient was treated with methyl prednisolone and intravenous vitamin B 1. On the fifth day after admission, fluctuations in visual findings were observed, and light reflex loss and pupillary dilatation developed. Upon examination one and six months later, bilateral (total) amaurosis and bilateral optic atrophy were detected. This case demonstrates bilateral putaminal involvement after exposure to a very low dose of methanol...|$|R
40|$|Background. This case {{highlights}} the importance of recognising multiple pathologies within the eye which may not necessarily be linked. Both birdshot retinochoroiditis and astrocytoma are rare conditions. The case underlines the need for early identification and treatment of birdshot retinochoroiditis with steroids and disease modifying drugs. Astrocytoma in the absence of tuberous sclerosis is also uncommon. Case Presentation. A 36 -year-old male presented with 3 -month history of <b>bilateral</b> progressive flashing <b>lights</b> and floaters. He was systemically well with no significant past medical history. Fundal examination revealed retinal vasculitis and active creamy lesions in the choroid radiating from the optic nerve. In the supranasal periphery of the right eye there was a raised white, jagged lesion protruding into the vitreous. Fluorescein angiogram and indocyanine green showed marked venous vasculitis, hypofluorescence, and disc leakage in keeping with birdshot retinochoroiditis. The supranasal lesion features were in keeping with astrocytoma and this was thought to be a coincidental finding. Conclusions. Retinal astrocytoma may be present as an isolated ocular finding; however, patients must still be investigated for tuberous sclerosis which is the most common association. Birdshot retinochoroiditis typically responds well to steroid therapy, and disease modifying drugs should be considered as soon as possible...|$|R

Since her initial evaluation she had complained of continued dry mouth, sore throat, diplopia, and episodes of slurred speech. On evaluation in a California emergency department, the patient complained of diplopia and trouble swallowing. She was noted to be “sleepy”, with drooping eyelids, but she was able to answer all questions appropriately and did not appear intoxicated. On careful questioning, the patient admitted to being an injection drug abuser. Past medical history was non-contributory. She used no medications and denied any surgical history. She had no history of drug allergies and family history was negative. Physical exam demonstrated a women sitting on a gurney with her eyes partially closed. She answered all questions without any sign of confusion. Airway was open, but the patient had to repeatedly clear her throat. Pulse was 105, BP 125 / 90 lying and 93 / 70 standing, and respiratory rate was 18. Temperature was 37. 1 and oxygen saturation was 98 % on room air.

40|$|Decompressive {{craniectomy}} (DC) {{has been}} proposed as a lifesaving treatment in patients with elevated intracranial pressure, but its effectiveness on reaching a favorable neurologic outcome remains unclear. We identified predictors of outcome in a large, single-center cohort of patients undergoing DC for different pathologic conditions. This retrospective study included all patients undergoing DC from 2006 to 2014. The 1 -year outcome, assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), was dichotomized into favorable (GOS 4 - 5) and unfavorable (GOS 1 - 3) outcome. Predictors of outcome were identified by analyzing patient characteristics. DC was performed in 204 patients for ischemic stroke (n = 57), traumatic brain injury (n = 50), aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) (n = 44), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (n = 29), cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) (n = 14), or other indications (n = 10). Overall, 69 (34 %) patients survived favorably, 39 (19 %) survived unfavorably, and 96 (47 %) died. Higher age, poor Glasgow Coma Scale score, intubated status before DC, bilateral absence of pupillary light reflexes, DC for aSAH, and additional surgeries after DC (excluding cranioplasty) were significant predictors of unfavorable outcome. When patients were sorted for pathologic conditions and predictors of outcome, favorable outcome rates differed remarkably, ranging from 91 % for CVT patients undergoing uncomplicated DC to 0 % for aSAH patients undergoing DC for secondary infarction or ICH patients with unilateral or <b>bilateral</b> abnormal pupillary <b>light</b> reflexes upon admission. Long-term neurologic outcome after DC differed remarkably among subpopulations of patients, with favorable outcome rates ranging from 0 % to > 90...|$|R
40|$|Five case {{histories}} illustrate the disabling visual diseases caused by retinal and cerebral infarction in incontinentia pigmenti. Cortical blindness was definitely present in one baby, who had <b>bilateral</b> absence of <b>light</b> perception, and was probably {{present in a}} second infant also. Retinal detachment occurred in three eyes of three patients, one of whom had spontaneous reattachment. In a second patient, a partial tractional retinal detachment progressed within 4 months during infancy to a total, inoperable, retrolental, white fibrovascular mass mimicking stage 5 retinopathy of prematurity. Phthisis bulbi resulted. In a third patient, a localized tractional retinal detachment originated at the nonperfused macula and extended over a 7 -month period to the ora serrata. Preretinal neovascularization waxed and waned in these and other patients. Abnormalities of the macula were pronounced but were sometimes difficult to detect. Their severity and relative frequency have not been previously described in detail. Abnormalities included blunting or absence of the foveal pit and absence of the normal foveal avascular zone. One patient at 12 days of age had an infarcted macula with a cherry-red spot. Similar episodes may have occurred in other children and would be sufficient to explain the appearance of macular abnormalities and otherwise unexplainable poor visual acuity in older individuals. Well-focused macular angiography appears to be highly useful in explaining visual disability due to abnormal foveal anatomy and function. Optic atrophy occurred in several eyes. Its pathogenesis may be multifactorial. Further research is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms of vascular closure in the retina {{as well as the}} pathogenesis of destructive encephalopathy in this exceptionally severe disease. Valid therapeutic possibilities may then become more obvious than they are at present. It is possible that the retina and brain undergo similar disease processes in incontinentia pigmenti...|$|R
40|$|AIM—To {{ascertain}} utility values {{associated with}} varying degrees of legal blindness.  METHODS—A cross sectional study on three group of patients. There were: (1) 15  patients with complete absence of vision (no light perception) in at least one eye who were asked to assume a scenario of no light perception in the second eye as well, (2) 17  patients with light perception to counting fingers in the better seeing eye, and (3) 33  patients with 20 / 200 - 20 / 400 vision in the better seeing eye. Utility values were measured using the time trade-off and standard gamble methods {{in each of the three}} groups.  RESULTS—The mean time trade-off utility value for the no light perception group with the theoretical scenario of <b>bilateral</b> absence of <b>light</b> perception was 0. 26  (95 % CI, 0. 19 - 0. 33). The mean utility value for the light perception to counting fingers group was 0. 47  (95 % CI, 0. 33 - 0. 61), and the mean utility value for the 20 / 200 - 20 / 400 group was 0. 65  (95 % CI, 0. 58 - 0. 72). Thus, patients with no light perception in one eye, who were presented with the same scenario in the second eye as well, were willing to trade almost 3  out of every 4  years of remaining life in return for perfect vision in each eye. Those with light perception to counting fingers would trade approximately 1  of 2  remaining years and those with 20 / 200 - 20 / 400 would trade approximately 1  of 3  remaining years.  CONCLUSIONS—There is a wide range of utility values associated with legal blindness. The utility value decreases dramatically with perceived total loss of vision (absence of light perception in each eye), compared with counting fingers to light perception vision, indicating that the preservation of even small amounts of vision in patients with legal blindness is critically important to their wellbeing and functioning in life. ...|$|R
