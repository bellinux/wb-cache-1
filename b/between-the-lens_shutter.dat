50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} of medium-format 120 film SLR cameras also made leaf-shutter lenses for their focal-plane-shutter models. Rollei {{made at least}} two such lenses for their Rolleiflex SL-66 medium format which was a focal-plane shutter SLR. Rollei later switched to a camera system of leaf-shutter design (e.g., the 6006 and 6008 reflexes) and their current medium-format SLRs are now all of the <b>between-the-lens</b> <b>shutter</b> design.|$|E
50|$|At long last, Rollei had {{a camera}} that could match the Hasselbad 500C. Indeed, {{had it been}} {{released}} earlier, around 1960 say, {{it could have been}} enormously successful. On top of that, despite declining profit margins and tough competition from the Japanese, Rollei continued to target its advertising at the amateur market. In contrast, other companies such as Leitz and Hasselblad had better understood how to promote their expensive cameras in photographic magazines - not just through paid advertising, but also through feature articles in the editorial pages. As a result, the SL66 never sold in the numbers that the company had hoped for or needed. Nevertheless, Rollei owes its survival as a company to the SL66 camera system, along with its enduring reputation for quality. Its successor, the SL66E, was released in 1984; externally the camera was largely unchanged, but it now had a built-in light meter. Additional lenses were released, such as the Fisheye-Distagon (f/3.5, 30 mm), the Distagon (f/4, 40 mm), and the Sonnar (f/4, 150 mm) with a <b>between-the-lens</b> <b>shutter</b> along with more accessories including close-up lenses, extension bellows, a Polaroid film cassette, a sheet film cassette, an underwater housing, and a ring flash unit. Its successor, the SL66-X, released in 1968 only had TTL flash metering, while the SL66-SE (Special Edition) also included a standard light meter. Prior to this, TTL metering required a special prism viewfinder with a built-in light meter. The release in 1992 of the SE Exclusive Professional incorporating selective gold-plating on the housing marked the end of the SL66 series.|$|E
40|$|When {{photographic}} equipment is miniaturized, {{in order to}} conserve weight and size for spacecraft use, by using wide angle, short focus lenses, a band-type central <b>between-the-lens</b> <b>shutter</b> must be used. The rectangular slot shape was the form with the highest optical efficiency. To overcome the problem of burrs caused in the punching out of the slots in a carbon steel band, a shape limited by arcs with radius equal to half the slot width is preferred...|$|E
50|$|A primary {{example of}} a medium-format SLR with a <b>between-the-lens</b> leaf <b>shutter</b> system would be Hasselblad, with their 500C, 500CM, 500 EL-M (a {{motorized}} Hasselblad) and other models (producing a 6 cm square negative). Hasselblads use an auxiliary shutter blind situated behind the lens mount and the mirror system to prevent the fogging of film.|$|R
50|$|Other medium-format SLRs {{also using}} leaf {{shutters}} include the now discontinued Zenza-Bronica camera system lines {{such as the}} Bronica ETRs, the ETRs'i (both producing a 6 × 4.5 cm. image), the SQ and the SQ-AI (producing a 6 × 6 cm image like the Hasselblad), and the Zenza-Bronica G system (6 × 7 cm). Certain Mamiya medium-format SLRs, discontinued camera systems such as the Kowa 6 {{and a few other}} camera models also used <b>between-the-lens</b> leaf <b>shutters</b> in their lens systems.|$|R
