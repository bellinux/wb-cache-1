40|$|Associations of race, smoking {{history and}} {{fibrinogen}} levels with cancer mortality were investigated prospectively using the ARIC study. Our cohort consisted of 14, 320 participants aged 45 - 64 at baseline. In an adjusted Cox regression, <b>black</b> <b>current</b> heavy smokers (> or = 15 cigarettes per day) demonstrated {{higher risk of}} respiratory/intrathoracic organ cancer mortality than nonblack <b>current</b> heavy smokers. <b>Black</b> former heavy smokers were also found to be at {{an increased risk of}} respiratory/intrathoracic organ cancer mortality when compared to nonblack former heavy smokers. Elevated fibrinogen levels were associated with an increased risk of respiratory/intrathoracic organ cancer mortality. Compared to fibrinogen or = 336 mg/dl had an adjusted hazard ratio of 3. 78 (95 % CI: 1. 84 - 7. 75). Fibrinogen was also a predictor of other types of cancer mortality among black participants, but not among nonblack participants. For 10 race/smoking history categories, fibrinogen levels ranged from a mean of 287 mg/dl for nonblack former light smokers to a mean of 338 mg/dl for <b>black</b> <b>current</b> heavy smokers. Smokers had higher fibrinogen levels than nonsmokers, and black smokers had higher fibrinogen levels than nonblack smokers. Smoking carries high risks of cancer mortality for African Americans. A factor that needs to be considered in the overall assessment of risk is fibrinogen level, which has been linked to angiogenesis and metastases of tumors...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{compared}} mean carotenoid intake in the United States by {{demographic and}} lifestyle variables to identify potential high-risk subgroups for disease. METHODS: Adults 18 to 99 {{years of age}} (n = 22 080) completed a food frequency questionnaire in the 1987 National Health Interview Survey, and mean carotenoid intakes were estimated. RESULTS: Carotenoid intakes were lower among Whites (vs <b>Blacks),</b> <b>current</b> smokers (vs nonsmokers), nondrinkers (vs drinkers), adults 18 to 39 years of age (vs those 40 to 69 years of age), frequent restaurant consumers (vs those who ate at home), and less educated (vs college-educated) persons. CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of a carotenoid-rich diet should be communicated to high-risk subgroups...|$|R
