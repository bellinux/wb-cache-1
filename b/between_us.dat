5|$|PA 106 was {{originally}} an alignment of PA47 designated in 1927. This alignment stretched from US 11 in Kingsley to the intersection with US 6 in Carbondale. In {{the plan for}} the U.S. Highway System from November 11, 1926, the road between Wyalusing and Carbondale {{was to be a}} part of US 6 while US 106 was to run from US 6 in Wyalusing to the New York border at the Delaware River in Narrowsburg via Scranton. By 1928, US 6 and US 106 switched alignments between Wyalusing and Carbondale. The piece of US 106 that is now PA 106 began in the community of Kingsley and went to the city of Carbondale. The route remained intact for almost 45 years. On December 3, 1971, the American Association of State Highway Officials approved the elimination of the US 106 designation. On March 14, 1972, US 106 was decommissioned and replaced with PA 706 <b>between</b> <b>US</b> 6 in Wyalusing and US 11 south of New Milford, PA 106 <b>between</b> <b>US</b> 11 in Kingsley and US 6 in Carbondale, and PA 652 <b>between</b> <b>US</b> 6 in Indian Orchard and the Delaware River. The remainder of the route was removed from concurrencies with US 11 between south of New Milford and Kingsley and US 6 between Carbondale and Indian Orchard. Signs were changed by April of that year.|$|E

5|$|Baltimore Avenue and Philadelphia Avenue {{date back}} to the {{founding}} of Ocean City in 1875. Both avenues originally extended from South Division Street to North Division Street. The streets were later extended north as far as 15th Street. Baltimore Avenue served as the main thoroughfare of Ocean City until Philadelphia Avenue and Coastal Highway assumed predominance in the 1950s. MD 378 was assigned to Baltimore Avenue, which was paved from US 213 (Worcester Street) to 15th Street by 1927. MD 528 was assigned to Philadelphia Avenue when that street was rebuilt <b>between</b> <b>US</b> 213 and 15th Street in 1933. MD 528 was extended north to the Delaware state line when Coastal Highway was completed in 1939.|$|E

5|$|Between 1932 and 1934, {{the road}} east of Mecca had been paved. The {{western part of}} the road, known as the Box Canyon road, from Mecca to Blythe served as part of US 60 and US 70 until it was {{eventually}} bypassed in favor of a more direct route to Indio, diverging at Shavers' Summit. Between 1934 and 1936, US 60 and US 70 had made the shift north towards Indio, and the portion <b>between</b> <b>US</b> 99 and Mecca was paved. Initial opposition was later overcome after the road was washed out during a storm and forced motorists to take refuge in the nearby foothills. By 1940, the SR 195 designation was signed. In the 1940s, the highway continued due west of Mecca to end at an intersection with US 99, rather than turning south.|$|E
5|$|But in 1960, Jacob Dekema, the {{district}} highway engineer, stated {{that due to}} lower traffic on US 80, {{the completion of the}} freeway through the mountains would be delayed until at least 1971. Construction of the section of US 80 from Magnolia Avenue to Third Street was contracted for $2.7 million in April. That year, work continued on the freeway, and in August, only one traffic signal was left on the highway west of El Cajon, at Ward Road. In August, Dekema announced that bids for the portion between Lake Murray Boulevard and Third Street would be opened the following month; once that was completed, the entire freeway west of El Cajon would be complete. Eastbound lanes <b>between</b> <b>US</b> 395 and Fairmount Avenue opened on November 23.|$|E

The US I and IX Corps were to defend the Imjin and Hantan River respectively, while the ROK III Corps were to guard the areas around Chuncheon.

5|$|In 1927, a spur of Route 4, Route S4A, was {{proposed}} as a route running from Route 4 (now U.S. Route 9) in Tuckerton in Ocean County south to Little Beach. In 1929, this route was to continue south through Brigantine to Atlantic City, with the portion south of Little Beach {{to be built}} by Atlantic County. The state of New Jersey took over the proposed extension of Route S4A from Little Beach to Atlantic City in 1938. However, the portion of this route between Brigantine and the Atlantic/Ocean County line was never built, and the portion of road that existed in Ocean County {{was removed from the}} state highway system by 1941. In 1945, another route called Route S56, a spur of Route 56 (now U.S. Route 30), {{was proposed}} to run north along Brigantine Boulevard (present-day Route 187 and Route 87) from Atlantic City to Brigantine. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 87 was designated as an unsigned route along the former alignment of Route S4A and the proposed Route S56 <b>between</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 30 in Atlantic City and Brigantine. Following the 1953 renumbering, the southern portion of Route 87 in Atlantic City split into two alignments, with one following Huron Avenue and the other following Brigantine Boulevard. Eventually, the alignment of Route 87 along Brigantine Boulevard <b>between</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 30 and Huron Avenue became Route 187. In 2001, the Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector was completed, linking Route 87, the casinos in the Marina District, and Brigantine with the Atlantic City Expressway.|$|E
5|$|Large {{numbers of}} United States {{military}} personnel were based in Australia {{during the first}} years of the Pacific War. The first US units arrived in Australia in early 1942 and almost 1million US personnel passed through Australia during the war.

Though relations between Australians and Americans were generally good, there was some conflict <b>between</b> <b>US</b> and Australian soldiers, such as the Battle of Brisbane, and the Australian Government only reluctantly accepted the presence of African American troops.|$|E
