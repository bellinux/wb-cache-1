Writing {{code that}} manipulates bit streams is a painful and {{error-prone}} programming task, often performed via <b>bit</b> <b>twiddling</b> {{techniques such as}} explicit bit shifts and bit masks in programmer-allocated buffers. Still, this kind of programming is necessary in many application areas ranging from decoding streaming media files to implementing network protocols. In this paper we employ highlevel constructs from declarative programming, such as pattern matching at the bit level and bit stream comprehensions, and show how a variety of bit stream programming applications can be written in a succinct, less error-prone, and totally memory-safe manner. We also describe how these constructs can be implemented efficiently. The resulting performance is superior {{to that of other}} (purely) functional languages and competitive to that of low-level languages such as C. ...|$|E
40|$|Writing {{code that}} manipulates bit streams is a painful and errorprone {{programming}} task, currently often performed via <b>bit</b> <b>twiddling</b> {{techniques such as}} explicit bit shifts and bit masks in programmer-allocated buffers. Still, this kind of programming is necessary in many application areas ranging from decoding streaming media files to implementing network protocols. In this paper we show how high-level constructs from functional programming, such as binary pattern matching at the bit level and binary comprehensions, can make bit stream manipulation more succinct, less error-prone, and totally memory-safe. We formally define these language constructs, show a variety of example uses from several different application areas, and describe their implementation in detail. We hold that a binary data structure {{with the ability to}} perform pattern matching at the bit level allows (purely) functional languages to significantly expand the range of their practical uses. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Machine-code {{decompilation}} is a reverse-engineering discipline {{focused on}} reverse compilation. It performs an application recovery from binary executable files {{back into the}} high level language (HLL) representation. One of its critical tasks is to produce an accurate and well-readable code. However, this is a challenging task since the executable code may be produced {{by one of the}} modern compilers that use advanced optimizations. One type of such an optimization is usage of so-called instruction idioms. These idioms are used to produce faster or even smaller executable files. On the other hand, decompilation of instruction idioms without any advanced analysis produces almost unreadable HLL code that may confuse the user of a decompiler. In this paper, we present a method of instruction-idioms detection and reconstruction back into a readable form with the same meaning. This approach is adapted in an existing retargetable decompiler developed within the Lissom project. The implementation has been tested on several modern compilers and target architectures. According to our experimental results, the proposed solution is highly accurate on the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processor families, but it should be further improved on the CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architectures.
