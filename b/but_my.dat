5|$|In 1907, Besant {{became the}} {{president}} of the Theosophical Society globally, and set to work with a major expansion of the organisation's headquarters at Adyar, in what was then, Madras. When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth. Some months later in 1908, Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar. Of her time in India, Fuller wrote:I went in search not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye and emotions of all artists—but of something deeper—something less easily expressed. I spent {{two and a half years}} in a community that is quite unique—perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world—the headquarters of the Theosophical Society... Well, I painted there, of course, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> art was undergoing a change, and I felt that it could not satisfy me unless it became so much greater.|$|E

25|$|It was as hard-hitting a {{memorandum}} as I could make it. Butler {{accused me of}} overstating the lack of resolve in both Washington and London. <b>But</b> <b>my</b> argument over {{the need to get}} a concealment-based inspection on track did resonate with him. He authorized me to put together an updated inspection plan to take place following his August visit to Baghdad.|$|E

25|$|I {{started selling}} out on Dune. Looking back, it's no one's fault <b>but</b> <b>my</b> own. I {{probably}} shouldn't {{have done that}} picture, but I saw tons and tons of possibilities for things I loved, {{and this was the}} structure to do them in. There was so much room to create a world. But I got strong indications from Raffaella and Dino De Laurentiis of what kind of film they expected, and I knew I didn't have final cut.|$|E
25|$|Caruso also {{appeared}} in two motion pictures. In 1918, he played a dual role in the American silent film My Cousin for Paramount Pictures. This film included a sequence depicting him on stage performing the aria Vesti la giubba from Leoncavallo's opera Pagliacci. The following year Caruso played a character called Cosimo in another film, The Splendid Romance. Producer Jesse Lasky paid Caruso $100,000 each to appear in these two efforts <b>but</b> <b>My</b> Cousin flopped {{at the box office}} and The Splendid Romance was apparently never released. Brief candid glimpses of Caruso offstage have been preserved in contemporary newsreel footage.|$|E
25|$|<b>But</b> <b>my</b> family {{acquired}} {{in the time of}} my father a plot of land upper than Mart Moura. It is called Marg el-Dayr and it belonged to the family Mousa. Its conversion into an orchard caused the cleaning of an oratory in decline devoted to Saint Augustine. Would it be rather there the place of celebration of the synod? I prefer to believe it because the place in question is on the border of the famous village of Bqoufa, also ruined, but from which we know that the prelates of the family Rizzi are originated, prelates who led our Church in those times with three successive patriarchs.|$|E

25|$|I {{would not}} wish to a dog or to a snake, to the most low and misfortunate {{creature}} of the earth, I would {{not wish to}} any of them what I have had to suffer for things that I am not guilty of. <b>But</b> <b>my</b> conviction is that I have suffered for things that I am guilty of. I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do what I have done already.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} is essentially whether correlations between base and supervenient properties hold within actual worlds only, or across possible worlds. For example, if psychological properties strongly locally supervene on physical properties, then any two people physically the same, in any two worlds, {{will also be}} psychologically the same. On the other hand, if psychological properties only weakly locally supervene on physical properties, then those correlations between base and supervenient properties that hold in virtue of the supervenience relation are maintained within each world, but can be different in different worlds. For example, my physical duplicates in the actual world {{will have the same}} thoughts as I have; <b>but</b> <b>my</b> physical duplicates in other possible worlds may have different thoughts than I have in the actual world.|$|E
25|$|I thought I {{would write}} Memories and the City in six months, {{but it took}} me one year to complete. And I was working twelve hours a day, just reading and working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t {{want to go into}} those details: divorce, father dying, {{professional}} problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I thought if I were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E

25|$|My dad was not {{the monster}} my lying brother said he was; he was strict, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name {{was the only way}} he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was {{the only way he could}} get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|E
