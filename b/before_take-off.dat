5|$|Pellerin was {{originally}} scheduled {{to fly in}} this mission, {{as he had done}} on the 17 June flight. Pellerin was unavailable for the flight on 24 June and Wolff was selected as the replacement aircrew member. Due to the short notice of his assignment to the mission, Wolff did not participate in the pre-flight briefing and boarded the aircraft after the engines were started. Thus, Wolff was not aware of the planned mission profile and did not have an opportunity to raise any objections <b>before</b> <b>take-off.</b>|$|E
5|$|High {{school student}} Alex Browning boards Volée Airlines Flight 180 with his classmates for their senior trip to Paris, France. <b>Before</b> <b>take-off,</b> Alex has a premonition {{that the plane}} will suffer a catastrophic engine failure, causing the plane to explode mid-air and kill {{everyone}} on board. When the events from his vision begin to repeat themselves in reality, he panics and a fight breaks out between Alex and his rival, Carter Horton. This leads to several passengers being removed from the plane, including Alex; Carter; Alex's best friend, Tod Waggner; Carter's girlfriend, Terry Chaney; teacher Valerie Lewton; and students Billy Hitchcock and Clear Rivers. None of the passengers, except for Clear, believe Alex about his vision until the plane explodes on take-off, killing the remaining passengers on board. Afterwards, the survivors are interrogated by two FBI agents, who believe that Alex {{had something to do}} with the explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan called}} for the units to {{maintain}} strict radio silence and secrecy {{in order to maintain}} surprise. Maps were also only half complete, identified only enemy installations, and left out flight paths, lest the document fall into Allied hands enabling them to trace the whereabouts of German fighter bases. Most commanders were also refused permission to brief their pilots until moments <b>before</b> <b>take-off.</b> This created operational confusion. Commanders only managed to get across the bare essentials of the plan. When the operation got under way, many German pilots still did not understand what the operation was about, or what exactly was required of them. They were convinced it was just a reconnaissance in force over the front, and were happy to follow their flight leaders on this basis.|$|E

5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>take-off,</b> D'Mario placed three cloth-covered foam {{cushions}} {{on top of}} {{a heating}} vent under the instructor navigator's seat in the aft section of the lower deck. Shortly after take-off, another cushion was placed under the seat. The flight was uneventful until the scheduled mid-air refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker, which had to be conducted manually because of an error with the B-52G's autopilot. About one hour after refueling, while the aircraft was circling above its designated area, Captain Haug directed co-pilot Svitenko to take his rest period. His seat was taken by the spare pilot, D'Mario. The crew was uncomfortable because of the cold, although the heater's rheostat was turned up, so D'Mario opened an engine bleed valve to draw additional hot air into the heater from the engine manifold. Because of a heater malfunction, the air barely cooled as it traveled from the engine manifold to the cabin's heating ducts. During the next half-hour, the cabin's temperature became uncomfortably hot, and the stowed cushions ignited. After one crew member reported smelling burning rubber, they looked for a fire. The navigator searched the lower compartment twice before discovering the fire behind a metal box. He attempted to fight it with two fire extinguishers, but could not put it out.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} SDU {{and ground}} station bias was calculated from 17 signals exchanged between the ground {{station and the}} aircraft during a 30-minute period <b>before</b> <b>take-off,</b> when the aircraft's location was known (at Kuala Lumpur International Airport). To establish the accuracy of their calculations, the bias value was {{used to calculate the}} distance from the aircraft to the satellite during the time it was on the ground at KLIA, with errors of <1 km-8.85 km (<1 mi-5.5 mi). The distance from the satellite to the aircraft was also calculated while the aircraft was in-flight and at a known location shortly after take-off, showing similar accuracy. The distance between the satellite and aircraft could thus be calculated for signals exchanged between 02:25–08:19, after Flight 370 disappeared from radar. However, this could only produce a ring on Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the calculated value, adjusted to account for the aircraft flying at 10,000 m (33,000 ft). The ring could also be reduced to an arc by taking into consideration the maximum range of the aircraft if it flew at its maximum speed.|$|E
25|$|On 11 May 2010, {{details from}} the cockpit voice {{recorder}} were leaked {{to the public and}} released by Spanish media. The recording showed that both pilots were concerned about a repair job performed earlier {{on the day of the}} crash, in which mechanics used an ice pack to cool an overheating temperature sensor and removed a fuse. The BBC reported that the judge investigating the crash was to question three mechanics on suspicion of manslaughter. These were the two mechanics who checked the plane <b>before</b> <b>take-off</b> and the head of maintenance for Spanair at Barajas.|$|E
50|$|The {{airport was}} inaugurated 20 April 1925 {{and was one}} of the first civil {{airports}} in the world. It consisted of a large, impressive terminal built of wood, a couple of hangars, a balloon mast, a hydroplane landing stage and a few grassy meadows that could be used as runways. The grass on the runways was kept short by sheep, which were shepherded away <b>before</b> <b>take-offs</b> and landings. From 1932 to 1939, takeoffs and landings increased from 6,000 to 50,000 and passenger number increased to 72,000. Between 1936 and 1939, a new terminal was built, considered one of the finest examples of Nordic functionalism. The terminal was designed by Vilhelm Lauritzen, who was considered a pioneer among architects, in terms not only of architecture and construction, but also of service and passenger comfort.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the changes in {{selected}} kinematics in the long jump, triple jump, and pole vault to highlight the unique movement pattern characteristics in the approach runs utilised in these events. Material and methods. Data were collected during 1 international and 2 national competitions from 36 male athletes (12 in each event) using an Optojump Next system. Results. This study showed the long jumpers achieved the highest mean step velocity, with the pole vaulters showing the lowest velocity. The velocity of the last step <b>before</b> the <b>take-off</b> was greater (p < 0. 05) than the velocity of the penultimate step in all groups of athletes. The length of the last step <b>before</b> the <b>take-off</b> was greater (p < 0. 01) than the length of the penultimate step in long jump and pole vault athletes compared to the triple jumpers. The long jumpers demonstrated less contact time (p < 0. 01) than the pole vaulters. The contact time of the take-off leg was shorter (p < 0. 01) compared to that of the non-take-off leg in pole vaulters. The pole vaulters demonstrated less flight time (p < 0. 05) compared to the triple jumpers. Lastly, the flight time during the last step <b>before</b> the <b>take-off</b> was shorter (p < 0. 01) than the flight time during the penultimate step in all groups. Conclusions. These findings revealed that each of the track and field jumping events required a distinctive approach run. Therefore, training workouts need to be designed specifically to train the unique gait pattern of the long jump, triple jump, and pole vault...|$|R

25|$|On 14 September 2011, {{a report}} in the {{newspaper}} Moskovsky Komsomolets, quoting a source in the aviation industry, claimed that the parking brake of the aircraft was on during the take-off, which significantly slowed it down and prevented it from accelerating properly. According to this theory, the captain had turned over control to the co-pilot <b>before</b> <b>take-off,</b> as he was not feeling well. As it is the captain's duty to release the brake, the co-pilot may not have been aware that it had not been done, or had forgotten to do so. Another newspaper, Lifenews.ru, reported that investigators were investigating the pilots' professional history, and that the pilots did not have sufficient experience on the Yak-42.|$|E

2500|$|The TR.9D HF radio {{telephone}} set in fighters {{at the time}} of the Battle of Britain had two channels and the operating frequencies of the two could only be selected <b>before</b> <b>take-off.</b> One channel was used for voice communication with sector control, while the other was used by the [...] "pip-squeak" [...] system. With only one voice channel, set to a squadron-specific frequency, the TR.9D limited the ability to co-ordinate with other squadrons. The set was low power, with a range of about [...] air-to-ground and [...] air-to-air, which presented numerous problems with reception quality. The TR.9 originally operated on a band that was relatively empty, but by the time of the war it was much busier and interference was a constant problem.|$|E
2500|$|German {{fighter pilot}} schools relied on fuel. They {{required}} [...] per month. With this achieved, they {{claimed to be}} able to train 1,200 fighter, 250 ground-attack, 40 bomber, 75 jet-bomber, 64 recce and 40 night fighter pilots a month. The schools demands were never met. Just [...] were delivered in July 1944, [...] in August and [...] in September. There were plenty of cadets joining, but the primary schools had to be shut down in favour of running the advanced flight schools. The influx of bomber pilots helped keep output high but it was not to last. By the autumn, the Luftwaffe was seeking anyone who already had basic experience in flying, so they could bypass the primary stages of flight school. One Luftwaffe pilot wrote that [...] "Each time I close the canopy <b>before</b> <b>take-off,</b> I feel that I am closing the lid of my own coffin." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{basis of}} the German authorities' case relied on the icy {{condition}} of the wings hours after the crash and {{a photograph of the}} aircraft (published in several newspapers) taken shortly <b>before</b> <b>take-off,</b> that appeared to show snow on the upper wing surfaces. When the original negative was examined, however, no snow or ice could be seen, the [...] "snow" [...] in the original having been due to the sun reflecting off the wings, which was clarified when examining the negative rather than the published pictures which had been produced from a copy negative. The witnesses were not called to the German inquiry and proceedings against Thain dragged on until 1968, when he was finally cleared of any responsibility for the crash. As the official cause, British authorities recorded a build-up of melting snow on the runway which prevented the [...] "Elizabethan" [...] from reaching the required take-off speed. Thain, having been dismissed by BEA shortly after the accident and never re-engaged, retired and returned to run his poultry farm in Berkshire.

50|$|In large {{airplanes}} e.g. commercial airliners, <b>before</b> the <b>take-off</b> is commenced, {{the highest}} speed {{from which a}} safe stop can be achieved on the remaining runway is calculated.

2500|$|Voyager's world flight takeoff {{took place}} on the longest runway at Edwards AFB at 8:01 am local time on December 14, 1986, with 3,500 of the world's press in attendance. As the plane accelerated, the tips of the wings, which were heavily loaded with fuel, were damaged as they {{unexpectedly}} flew down and scraped against the runway, ultimately causing pieces (winglets) to break off at both ends. [...] (The pilot had wanted to gain enough speed that the inner wings, rather than the fragile outer wings, would lift the plane; in 67 test flights, the plane had never been loaded to capacity.) [...] The aircraft accelerated very slowly and needed approximately 14,200 feet (2.7mi; 4.3km) of the runway to gain enough speed to lift from the ground, the wings arching up dramatically just <b>before</b> <b>take-off.</b> The two damaged winglets remained attached to the wings by only a thin layer of carbon fiber and were removed by flying the Voyager in a slip, which introduced side-loading, tearing the winglets off completely. [...] Some of the carbon fiber skin was pulled off in the process, exposing the blue form core. Burt Rutan following with pilot Mike Melvill determined that Voyager was still within its performance specifications despite the damage and decided to allow the flight to continue. [...] During the flight, the two pilots had to deal with extremely cramped quarters. To reduce stress, the two had originally intended to fly the plane in three-hour shifts, but flight handling characteristics while the plane was heavy prevented routine changeovers, and they became very fatigued. Rutan reportedly stayed at the controls without relief for almost the first three days of the flight.|$|E

Another approach was to tilt the tail stabiliser to deflect engine slipstream up through the rotor. The most acceptable solution was finally achieved with the C.19 Mk.4, which was produced in some quantities; a direct drive from the engine to the rotor was fitted, through which the rotor could be accelerated up to speed.
