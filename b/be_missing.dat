5|$|In Taiwan, outer {{bands of}} the storm {{produced}} significant amounts of rain over southeastern areas of the island. Along the western coast, rip currents resulted in the drowning of one person. Six hikers also were reported to <b>be</b> <b>missing.</b> In China, torrential rains triggered flooding that destroyed 100 homes, killed one person and left six others missing. In all, seven people were killed by Linfa, with damages in mainland China estimated at ¥641million (US$93.8million) and agricultural losses in Taiwan reached NT$400million (US$12.1million).|$|E
5|$|In late 2016, Zac Baird {{left the}} live band after 10 years, amidst {{conflicts}} between {{his wife and}} Munky's wife over Instagram. Jules Venturini completed the tour before Davey Oberlin {{was brought in to}} the band. It was later announced that Fieldy would <b>be</b> <b>missing</b> Korn's tour of South America and Robert Trujillo's (The Bassist of Metallica) son, Tye (who was 12 at the time) was brought in to perform with the band {{for the duration of the}} tour.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{set up a}} twenty-four-hour hotline {{for those}} with {{information}} on the case to call. A text hotline was also created. Many submitted information about potential matches, later revealed to <b>be</b> <b>missing</b> children in {{over half of the}} United States as well as European and South and Central American countries. A total of eighty-four billboards, including digital signs donated by Clear Channel, were also placed across the state of Massachusetts, encouraging individuals to report tips to the anonymous hotlines created for the child.|$|E

5|$|The {{multiplayer}} side of Mysteries of the Sith {{was received}} positively, {{but did not}} completely escape criticism. Emil Pagliarulo of The Adrenaline Vault questioned why certain features seemed to <b>be</b> <b>missing</b> from the multiplayer mode that {{were present in the}} single-player mode. One such feature is the rancor which appears prominently in a single-player level but is not in any multiplayer maps.|$|E
5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will <b>be</b> <b>missing</b> and so will the roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E
5|$|Suspicion {{continued}} to grow, and Maria's stepmother began talking of dreams that Maria {{had been murdered}} and buried in the Red Barn. On 19 April 1828, she persuaded her husband {{to go to the}} Red Barn and dig in one of the grain storage bins. He quickly uncovered the remains of his daughter buried in a sack. She was badly decomposed but still identifiable. An inquest was carried out at the Cock Inn at Polstead (which still stands today), where Maria was formally identified by her sister Ann from some physical characteristics. Her hair and some clothing were recognisable, and she was known to <b>be</b> <b>missing</b> a tooth which was also absent from the jawbone of the corpse. Evidence was uncovered to implicate Corder in the crime: his green handkerchief was discovered around the body's neck.|$|E

25|$|Video {{footage of}} the CIDG {{operations}} was found to <b>be</b> <b>missing.</b> An autopsy on Espinosa's body revealed that he was shot four times, with one bullet managing to exit the body.

50|$|Because one wooden pillow <b>was</b> <b>missing,</b> the {{carpenter}} blamed himself for being careless and insincere.
