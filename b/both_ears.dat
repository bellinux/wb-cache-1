5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of {{a single piece of}} elastic cartilage with a complicated relief on its inner surface and a fairly smooth configuration on its posterior surface. A tubercle, known as Darwin's tubercle, is sometimes present, lying in the descending part of the helix and corresponding to the ear-tip of mammals. The earlobe {{consists of}} areola and adipose tissue. The symmetrical arrangement of the two ears allows for the localisation of sound. The brain accomplishes this by comparing arrival-times and intensities from each ear, in circuits located in the superior olivary complex and the trapezoid bodies which are connected via pathways to <b>both</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} rare case of {{granuloma}} annulare (GA), affecting <b>both</b> <b>ear</b> antihelixes, in a 28 -year old male patient that {{presented with a}} 1 -year history of non-tender, firm, skin-colored, 1 ~ 5 mm papules on <b>both</b> <b>ear</b> antihelixes. There was no history of trauma. An excisional biopsy specimen taken {{from one of the}} lesions of the right ear revealed infiltration of histiocytes and lymphocytes around a zone of collagen alteration in the dermis. Based on the clinical and pathological findings, the patient was diagnosed with a rare case of bilateral GA of both antihelixes; this is the first report in the Korean dermatology literature...|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of IIH is headache, which occurs {{in almost all}} (92–94%) cases. It is {{characteristically}} worse in the morning, generalized in character and throbbing in nature. It {{may be associated with}} nausea and vomiting. The headache can be made worse by any activity that further increases the intracranial pressure, such as coughing and sneezing. The pain may also be experienced in the neck and shoulders. Many have pulsatile tinnitus, a whooshing sensation in one or <b>both</b> <b>ears</b> (64–87%); this sound is synchronous with the pulse. Various other symptoms, such as numbness of the extremities, generalized weakness, loss of smell, and loss of coordination, are reported more rarely; none are specific for IIH.

40|$|Highlights • Pet {{dogs were}} tested in a brief {{separation}} test and filmed remotely using thermography. • Temperature was analyzed from selected patches of <b>both</b> <b>ear</b> pinnae simultaneously. • Social isolation {{was associated with a}} significant decrease in ear pinnae temperature. • Temperature of the two ears did not differ significantly from each other. • Long distance thermography is a useful tool in non-invasive stress monitoring. Abstract Infrared thermography can visualize changes in body surface temperature that result from stress-induced physiological changes and alterations of blood flow patterns. Here we explored its use for remote stress monitoring (i. e. removing need for human presence) in a sample of six pet dogs. Dogs {{were tested in}} a brief separation test involving contact with their owner, a stranger, and social isolation for two one-minute-periods. Tests were filmed using a thermographic camera set up {{in a corner of the}} room, around 7 m from where the subjects spent most of the time. Temperature was measured from selected regions of <b>both</b> <b>ear</b> pinnae simultaneously. Temperatures of <b>both</b> <b>ear</b> pinnae showed a pattern of decrease during separation and increase when a person (either the owner or a stranger) was present, with no lateralized temperature differences between the two ears. Long distance thermographic measurement is a promising technique for non-invasive remote stress assessment, although there are some limitations related to dogs' hair structure over the ears, making it unsuitable for some subjects...|$|R

40|$|We evoked <b>both</b> <b>ear</b> and eye {{movements}} in area 8 b, the rostral area of frontal cortex, in two monkeys. In some sites {{it was possible}} to evoke only ear movements or only eye movements; in other locations we evoked <b>both</b> <b>ear</b> and eye movements by varying the intensity of electrical stimulation. The electrically evoked ear movements were forward, or backward, or oblique (upward-forward; upward-backward). In two penetrations the ear movements were bilateral, in the other penetrations they were contralateral. Ipsilateral ear movements were not observed. The evoked eye movements were mainly fixed-vector saccades, contralateral and with an upward orientation of about 45 degrees. If we considered only the sites where the threshold was equal to or lower than 50 microA, the stimulation of this area evoked mainly ear movements. In addition we recorded the electrical activity of 195 neurons. Of these neurons: 74 % (145 / 195) discharged before ear movements (ear cells); 20 % (40 / 195) discharged before ear and eye movements (ear-eye cells); 5 % (10 / 195) discharged only before eye movements (eye cells). Ninety-one percent (132 / 145) of ear cells presented a preferred direction; 90 % (36 / 40) of ear-eye cells presented a preferred direction for ear movements, and 15 % (6 / 40) presented a preferred direction for eye movements. Eighty-five percent (34 / 40) of cells did not present a preferred direction for visually guided saccades and were active when the monkey made saccades toward the unlit targets (checking saccades). Our results show that a field of area 8 b is related to ear movements and to eye-ear movements. The findings {{that it is possible to}} obtain <b>both</b> <b>ear</b> and eye movements with low-intensity currents and that there are cells firing for the two types of movements suggest that area 8 b may be involved in the orientation and coordination of <b>both</b> <b>ear</b> and eye. This area might be considered a rostral extension of supplementary eye field (SEF) or a different region. However, based on its distinct functional characteristics and connectivity, it is probably better regarded as a separate field. Regardless, the combination of 8 b and SEF may constitute a cortical center for orienting processes...|$|R

25|$|In early March of that year, neuroscientists Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima {{came from}} the Salk Institute for Biological Studies to {{administer}} their own series of brain exams on Genie. Audiometry tests confirmed that she had regular hearing in <b>both</b> <b>ears,</b> but {{on a series of}} dichotic listening tests Bellugi and Klima found that she identified language sounds with 100% accuracy in her left ear while correctly answering at only a chance level in her right ear. Such an extreme level of asymmetry on these tests had previously only been documented in patients with either split-brain or who had undergone a hemispherectomy as an adult. When they gave her monaural tests for both language and non-language sounds she answered with 100% accuracy in <b>both</b> <b>ears,</b> which was normal. On non-language dichotic listening tests she showed a slight preference for identifying non-language sounds in her left ear, which was typical for a right-handed person and helped rule out the possibility of her brain only being reversed in dominance for language.|$|E
