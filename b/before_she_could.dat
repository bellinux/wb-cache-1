5|$|Operation Tungsten was a Second World War Royal Navy {{air raid}} that {{targeted}} the German battleship Tirpitz. The operation sought to damage or destroy Tirpitz at her base in Kaafjord {{in the far}} north of Norway <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> become fully operational again following a period of repairs.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd) is {{revealed}} to secretly house his girlfriend, Lisa Hallett (Caroline Chikezie), a half-converted Cyberman, {{in the basement}} of the Torchwood Hub. Ianto wants to turn her into a human again, but by doing so her Cyberman influence takes control, and the rest of the team must stop her <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> become a threat to Earth. However, Ianto still believes she can be saved.|$|E
5|$|Natascha McElhone as Sylvia playing Lauren Garland (Truman's college schoolmate): Sylvia {{was hired}} to play a {{background}} extra, a fellow student at Truman's college, named Lauren. She became romantically involved with Truman and tried to reveal to him the truth about his life, but {{was thrown out of}} the show <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do so. She then becomes a protester against The Truman Show, urging Christof to release its lead.|$|E
6000|$|She {{paused for}} a moment <b>before</b> <b>she</b> replied;--but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not bring herself to be {{absolutely}} honest in the matter. [...] "No;--she didn't send me. But from what I see and hear, I am quite sure she does not wish to go on with it." ...|$|R

5|$|Roanoke, {{named after}} the Roanoke River, was laid down at the Norfolk Navy Yard in May 1854 and {{launched}} on 13 December 1855. The ship sank when launched {{and had to be}} refloated <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be completed. She was commissioned on 4 May 1857 with Captain John B. Montgomery in command.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty. Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to scuttle his ships. British sailors boarded Frankfurt and beached her <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> sink.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{transferred}} to Halifax, Nova Scotia that same month for convoy escort duties. In October 1939, York was assigned to Force F at Halifax, which was active in hunting for commerce raiders and protecting convoys. She was briefly refitted in Bermuda between 31 October and 22 November before she returned to Great Britain for a more thorough refit in December. Upon its completion on 9 February York {{was assigned to the}} 1st Cruiser Squadron of Home Fleet. On 3 March 1940 the ship intercepted the German blockade runner Arucas in the Denmark Strait near Iceland, but she was scuttled by her own crew <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be captured.|$|E
60|$|The moving shadow {{split into}} two shadows that stole closer, loomed <b>before</b> her. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not tell which belonged to Jim till he touched her. His touch was potent. It seemed to {{electrify}} her.|$|R
60|$|Realizing that {{something}} must be done, the young gymnast resolved to duck the girl. He did so, {{and when she came}} up again she lay as limp as <b>before.</b> Ere <b>she</b> <b>could</b> recover he struck out for the boat.|$|R
50|$|A {{married woman}} that delayed <b>before</b> <b>she</b> {{conceive}} pregnancy <b>could</b> also name the child Ozovehe, {{especially if the}} child is a male child.|$|R
5|$|After her commissioning, she was {{assigned}} {{to serve as a}} flotilla leader for torpedo boats. She participated in only one major action, Operation Albion, in October 1917. There, she shelled Russian gun batteries and troop positions and engaged Russian destroyers and gunboats. The ship also led a successful, albeit minor, operation against British shipping in the North Sea in December 1917. After the end of the war, she was interned {{with the rest of the}} German fleet in Scapa Flow. On 21 June 1919, the interned fleet scuttled itself, though Emden was run aground by British ships <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> sink completely. Ceded to France in the Treaty of Versailles, she was too badly damaged by the attempted scuttling and beaching to see service with the French Navy, so was instead used as a target after 1922, and broken up for scrap in 1926.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from the 1925 cruise, the ship was modernized at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She had her twelve old coal-fired boilers replaced with four oil-fired models, which were trunked into a single larger funnel. She also had more deck armor added {{to protect her from}} plunging fire, and a short tripod mast was installed in place of the aft cage mast. The modernization was completed in November 1926, after which Arkansas conducted a shakedown cruise in the Atlantic. She returned to Philadelphia, where she ran acceptance trials <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> rejoin the fleet. On 5 September 1927, Arkansas was present for ceremonies unveiling a memorial tablet honoring the French soldiers and sailors who died during the Yorktown campaign in 1781.|$|E
5|$|Aurelian, {{learning}} about Zenobia's departure, sent a contingent which captured the queen <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> cross the Euphrates to Persia; Palmyra capitulated soon after news of Zenobia's captivity reached {{the city in}} August 272. Aurelian sent the queen and her son to Emesa for trial, followed by most of Palmyra's court elite (including Longinus). According to the Augustan History and Zosimus, Zenobia blamed her actions on her advisers; however, there are no contemporary sources describing the trial, only later hostile Roman ones. The queen's reported cowardice in defeat was probably Aurelian's propaganda; it benefited the emperor to paint Zenobia as selfish and traitorous, discouraging the Palmyrenes from hailing her as a hero. Although Aurelian had most of his prisoners executed, he spared the queen and her son to parade her in his planned triumph.|$|E
50|$|The next morning, Billy goes to {{the airport}} to inquire about a flight for London. Jane had missed her flight the night <b>before</b> so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> watch the end of his perfect game. Finding her there waiting for her plane, they embrace and reconcile.|$|R
6000|$|Well, she didn't {{know what}} to say, that's a fact. You see, she never [...] thought of it in that light <b>before.</b> All <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say was, [...] "Well, [...] people have got reason, anyway, and turkeys have only got instinct; so [...] there!" ...|$|R
60|$|Kate did not resent this language; {{she even}} smiled, a little sadly. She {{had a great}} work <b>before</b> her, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not mind trifles.|$|R
5|$|Karlsruhe sank at 15:50; {{the rights}} to {{salvaging}} the ship were sold in 1962. She has not been raised for scrapping, however. Emden was boarded by British sailors who beached her <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be completely sunk. After being refloated, she was ceded to France and used as a test ship for explosives before being broken up in 1926. Nürnberg was also beached by British sailors. She was eventually sunk off the Isle of Wight as a gunnery target. Königsberg was meanwhile stricken from the naval register on 20 July 1920 and ceded to France. She was renamed Metz and served with the French Navy until 1933. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Peggy was {{introduced}} {{as a guest}} character in April 1991, by executive producer Michael Ferguson. The character was brought in {{as the mother of}} the already established Mitchell clan: Phil (Steve McFadden), Grant (Ross Kemp) and Sam (Danniella Westbrook). Specifically, she {{played a key role in}} a storyline about the elopement of her daughter Sam with Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen). Peggy was played by actress Jo Warne for a period of three months, but was written out upon the completion of the storyline. Two other actresses had been cast in the part before Warne. The first quit <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> film any scenes, and the second filmed eight episodes, though all of her scenes were scrapped before broadcast.|$|E
5|$|She {{attended}} {{primary school}} at the Sagrado Corazón de Jesús (Sacred Heart of Jesus) school in Rivas and the French school in Granada. Barrios began her secondary education at the Colegio La Inmaculada in Managua and then transferred to an American boarding school, as her parents wanted her to perfect her English. She first attended Our Lady of the Lake Catholic High School for Girls in San Antonio, Texas, and then in 1945 changed to Blackstone College for Girls in Virginia. In June 1947, her father was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and though he died <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make it home, she returned to Nicaragua, without graduating in the United States.|$|E

60|$|Even in the {{children}} <b>before</b> her <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see the inherited results of fruitless labor, and, more pitiful yet, in the bent shoulders of the older ones <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see the beginnings of deformity that would soon be permanent; and as these thoughts came to her, she clasped the wondering children to her side, with a convulsive wish to make life a little brighter for them.|$|R
60|$|Miss Rowly {{felt that}} {{something}} was going on <b>before</b> her which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not understand. Anything of this man's saying which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not fathom must be at least dangerous; so she determined to spoil his purpose, whatever it might be.|$|R
5|$|The Torchwood team {{become aware}} of the bizarre death and realises through CCTV that the gas has taken over Carys. Gwen feels guilty at having caused the man's death, but team leader Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) assures her that {{everybody}} makes mistakes. Gwen also learns that she is the only team member who's in a relationship, as the others are too busy working to find time. They later find where Carys lives and arrives there <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> harm a postman. When she tries to escape, Owen traps her using a portable prison cell, much to Jack's chagrin, as he forbids the removal of alien technology from Torchwood's base without his permission.|$|E
5|$|The revenue cutter Bear {{arrived in}} St Michael, Alaska, midway through June. Her master, Captain Cochran, {{agreed to go}} to Wrangel Island {{as soon as he}} got {{permission}} from the United States government. It would be impossible, in any event, to attempt the rescue before mid-July; ice conditions in the Arctic that year were reported as severe. After receiving permission, Bear, with Bartlett aboard, left St Michael on 13 July; the ship had many calls to make along the Alaskan coast <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> proceed with the rescue. On 5 August, at Port Hope, Bartlett met with Kataktovik and gave him his expedition wages and a new suit of clothing. At Point Barrow on 21 August Bartlett encountered Burt McConnell, Stefansson's erstwhile secretary, who gave details of Stefansson's movements after leaving Karluk the previous September. In April 1914, McConnell reported, Stefansson had headed north with two companions, searching for new lands.|$|E
5|$|When Makeba was {{eighteen}} days old, {{her mother was}} arrested and sentenced to a six-month prison term for selling umqombothi, a homemade beer brewed from malt and cornmeal. The family could not afford the small fine required to avoid a jail term, and Miriam spent {{the first six months}} of her life in jail. As a child, Makeba sang in the choir of the Kilnerton Training Institute in Pretoria, an all-black Methodist primary school that she attended for eight years. Her talent for singing earned her praise at school. Makeba was baptised a Protestant, and sang in church choirs, in English, Xhosa, Sotho, and Zulu; she later said that she learned to sing in English <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> speak the language.|$|E
60|$|All this I saw at a glance, and {{immediately}} afterwards I also perceived {{that she had}} most beautiful teeth; for when she beheld me as I rose from my chair and stood in my elevated position <b>before</b> her <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not restrain a laugh; but for this apparent impoliteness I did not blame her at all.|$|R
60|$|She had {{his picture}} in her room, and {{sometimes}} she sat down to write with his sadly inscrutable face <b>before</b> her. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> see in it (as she studied it here in her home) the lines of varied and restless thought which make up {{the face of a}} man who largely comprehends American civilization in the light of experience.|$|R
60|$|The Queen {{looked at}} him and was almost as much afraid of his ugly little face as she had been of the lions <b>before,</b> so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not speak a word.|$|R
5|$|With {{the signing}} of the Armistice on 11 November, the {{fighting}} came to an end and the task of bringing home American soldiers began almost immediately. To that end, Kentuckian was acquired by the United States Navy on 16 December, and commissioned on 28 January 1919 with Lieutenant Commander Carrol E. Higgins, NAR, in command. <b>Before</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> begin returning troops, though, Kentuckian had to undergo conversion from a cargo and animal ship. Though sources do not indicate the specific modifications Kentuckian underwent, typical conversions for other ships included the installation of berths for troops, and adding greatly expanded cooking and toilet facilities to handle the large numbers of men aboard. Similar modifications on a fellow American-Hawaiian cargo ship, the two-years-younger , took three months, but it is not known how long Kentuckians refit took.|$|E
5|$|By January 1947 the Army {{no longer}} needed a ship with Crusaders capabilities, and she was loaned to the Australian Shipping Board. In February that year she transported a load of earth moving {{equipment}} from Melbourne to Launceston, and carried a cargo of timber back to Melbourne. She continued to be manned by an Army crew and made several further trips between Tasmania and the mainland, but in April 1947 {{it was reported that}} the ship was to be scrapped on the grounds that she was considered unseaworthy. Gil Duthie, the Federal member for Wilmot, sought to have Crusader retained in service until the shortage of shipping capable of transporting heavy loads to and from Tasmania was rectified. The Shipping Control Board rejected Duthrie's representations on the grounds that Crusader would need extensive alterations <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be permanently used for commercial trade, and it would take at least a year to complete the necessary works. However, the Board gave a commitment to make other ships available to transport timber from Tasmania. Crusader was subsequently offered for sale, and was purchased by the Queensland Cement and Lime Company (QCL). She arrived at Brisbane on 28 September 1947 and was subsequently renamed Cementco.|$|E
5|$|From early 1929 Anderson {{lived with}} Annie Burr Jennings, a wealthy Park Avenue {{spinster}} happy to host someone {{she supposed to}} be a daughter of the Tsar. For eighteen months, Anderson was the toast of New York City society. Then a pattern of self-destructive behavior began that culminated in her throwing tantrums, killing her pet parakeet, and on one occasion running around naked on the roof. On 24 July 1930, Judge Peter Schmuck of the New York Supreme Court signed an order committing her to a mental hospital. <b>Before</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be taken away, Anderson locked herself in her room, and the door was broken in with an axe. She was forcibly taken to the Four Winds Sanatorium in Westchester County, New York, where she remained for slightly over a year. In August 1932, Anderson returned to Germany accompanied by a private nurse in a locked cabin on the liner Deutschland. Jennings paid for the voyage, the stay at the Westchester sanatorium, and an additional six months' care in the psychiatric wing of a nursing home at Ilten near Hanover. On arrival at Ilten, Anderson was assessed as sane, but as the room was prepaid, and she had nowhere else to go, she stayed on in a suite in the sanatorium grounds.|$|E
