5000|$|The red-lipped <b>batfish</b> or Galapagos <b>batfish</b> (Ogcocephalus darwini) is a fish {{of unusual}} {{morphology}} found around the Galapagos Islands and off Peru at depths of 3 to 76 m. Red-lipped <b>batfish</b> {{are closely related}} to rosy-lipped <b>batfish</b> (Ogcocephalus porrectus), which are found near Cocos Island off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. This fish is mainly known for its bright red lips. <b>Batfish</b> are not good swimmers; they use their highly adapted pectoral fins to [...] "walk" [...] on the ocean floor. When the <b>batfish</b> reaches maturity, its dorsal fin becomes a single spine-like projection (thought to function primarily as a lure for prey). Like other anglerfish, the red-lipped <b>batfish</b> has a structure on its head known as illicium. This structure is employed for attracting prey.|$|R

They are spade-shaped and laterally compressed, and have very symmetrical, triangular dorsal and anal fins. They are shiny silver with areas of yellow and vertical brown or black banding. The eyes are often located in one of the vertical bands as a method of camouflage. Scuba divers sometimes mistake them for angelfish, which are similar in shape, but not closely related. Other genera in the family are characterized by long, trailing, pointed dorsal and anal fins. Most species feed primarily on algae and small invertebrates.|$|E
