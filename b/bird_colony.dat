25|$|The {{peninsula}} {{supports a}} variety of ecological vegetation communities which are of conservation concern within the Gippsland Plains Bioregion. These include Grassy Woodland (Endangered), <b>Bird</b> <b>Colony</b> Succulent Herbland (Rare), Estuarine Flats Grassland (Endangered), Coastal Tussock Grassland (Vulnerable) and Coastal Dune Scrub (Depleted). Overall vegetation of the Summerland Peninsula is dominated by Coast Tussock-grass (Poa poiformis), Bower Spinach (Tetragonia implexicoma), Seaberry Saltbush (Rhagodia candolleana), Rounded Noon-flower (Disphyma crassifolium subsp. davellatum) and coastal tea-tree (Leptospermum laevigatum).|$|E
25|$|Vegetation {{communities}} {{are determined by}} wind exposure, salt-spray, soil composition, geology, presence of seabird colonies and past land management practices. Ecological vegetation classes on the plateau include Grassy Woodland and Coastal Tussock Grassland, the steep, exposed coastal cliffs of the Peninsula consists of Coastal Tussock Grassland and Coastal Dune Scrub and extensive areas of <b>Bird</b> <b>Colony</b> Succulent Herbland are found on the southern cliff faces and cliff tops among little penguin and short-tailed shearwater colonies, including the Nobbies.|$|E
2500|$|The refuge was {{established}} by President Theodore Roosevelt after being persuaded by two young conservationists—William L. Finley and Herman Bohlman—who studied and photographed Three Arch Rocks from Oceanside beginning in 1901. [...] They recorded hunters killing dozens of sea lions at a time for skin and oil, and sportsmen shooting seabirds purely for sport. [...] Due to a scarcity of regional chicken farms at the time, seabird eggs were priced at up to a dollar per dozen, encouraging egg harvesting and reducing the <b>bird</b> <b>colony</b> population. [...] Finley and Bohlman suggested a wildlife refuge to Roosevelt for protecting dwindling populations and ensure survival of seabird and marine mammal populations. [...] Roosevelt declared the refuge in 1907.|$|E

Automation of censusing would efficienfiy provide consistent and easily collected data which would aid in the monitoring of <b>bird</b> <b>colonies.</b> This paper analyzes some typical scenes from <b>bird</b> <b>colonies</b> and describes our experiments of applying well-known computer vision techniques to those scenes. After a short description of the template matching, convolution, and motion analysis methods we used, we analyze four different classes of scenes using those techniques. They are as follows: Kittiwake colony scenes are analyzed by convolution with a filter especially constructed to find light circles with dark edges. Results of that analysis show an improvement over direcfiy thresholding such images...|$|R

60|$|The {{starlings}} and sparrows {{were in a}} {{small minority}} among the breeders, but including these there were seven species in all, {{and as far as}} I could make out numbered about three hundred and fifty birds--probably the largest wild <b>bird</b> <b>colony</b> on any building in England.|$|E
60|$|Since {{that visit}} to Salisbury, {{described}} in a former chapter, when I watched {{and listened to the}} doves in those cold days in early spring, I have been there a good many times, but never at the time when the <b>bird</b> <b>colony</b> is most interesting to observe, just before and during {{the early part of the}} breeding-season. At length, in the early days of June, 1908, the wished opportunity was mine--wished yet feared, seeing that it was possible some disaster had fallen upon that unique colony of stock-doves. It is true they appeared to be long established and well able to maintain their foothold on the building in spite of malicious persecuting daws, but there was nothing to show that they had been long there, seeing that it had been observed by no person but myself that the cathedral doves were stock-doves and not the domestic pigeon found on other large buildings. Great was my happiness to find them still there, as well as the daws and all the other feathered people who make this great building their home; even the kestrels were not wanting. There were three there one morning, quarrelling with the daws in the old way in the old place, halfway up the soaring spire. The doves were somewhat diminished in number, but there were a good many pairs still, and I found no dead young ones lying about, as they were now probably grown too large to be ejected, but several young daws, about a dozen I think, fell to the ground during my stay. Undoubtedly they were dragged out of their nests and thrown down, perhaps by daws at enmity with their parents, or it may be by the doves, who are not meek-spirited, as we have seen, or they would not be where they are, and may on occasion retaliate by invading their black enemies' nesting-holes.|$|E

The data on the content of total nitrogen and chlorophyll in plants and lichens in communities located beneath <b>bird</b> <b>colonies</b> in the West Svalbard. The study showed that plant communities of rookeries, where the effect of one of the limiting factors of the Arctic (poor soil horizon) is reduced, give some idea of the "Green Arctic", where the current climate change is guiding it...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} smaller {{introduced}} plants spreading, such as rosa rugosa. However, {{due to the}} often steep terrain, forestry has been somewhat limited in the coastal area, and many areas with original vegetation remain, but are often fragmented, especially so {{in the southern part}} of the ecoregion.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare cyanobacterial and algal assemblages {{occurring}} in ornithocoprophilous habitats formed under the influence of two seabird colonies (mixed colony of piscivorous Uria lomvia and Rissa tridactyla and planktivorous Alle alle) nesting on the southwest side of Hornsund (Spitsbergen). Various influences of the <b>bird</b> <b>colonies</b> (e. g. surface trophy, treading) lead to the formation of ornithogenic habitats with quantitatively and qualitatively diverse cyanobacterial and algal assemblages. Only 6 species common to both habitats were identified, but due to their different proportions the similarity ended there. Cyanobacterial and algal assemblages of both ornithogenic habitats also react rather differently to the intensity of the bird colonies’ influence. The assemblages located directly beneath piscivorous bird nests were characterized by a larger number of species, which decreased the farther from the colony it was. Cyanobacterial and algal assemblages located directly next to planktivorous bird nests were species poor, but species richness increased at locations farther from their direct influence. The obtained results confirmed that <b>bird</b> <b>colonies</b> characterized by different diet and behavior influenced the formation of two separate, quantitatively and qualitatively different cyanobacterial and algal assemblages. Species such as Eucapsis sp., Gleocapsopsis sp., Gloeothece sp., Woronichinia sp., Hematococcus sp. were characteristic for algae and cyanobacteria assemblages in the vicinity of piscivorous <b>bird</b> <b>colonies,</b> whereas Aphanocapsa sp., Gloeothece sp., Komvophoron minutum, Pseudanabaena sp., Gloeocystis sp. 2 occurred in the vicinity of planktivorous <b>bird</b> <b>colonies...</b>|$|R
