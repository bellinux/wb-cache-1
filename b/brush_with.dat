5|$|Although {{the archaeological}} record does not provide {{examples}} of brushes or pens, analysis of ink strokes on the Postclassic codices suggests that it was applied with a <b>brush</b> <b>with</b> a tip fashioned from pliable hair. A Classic period sculpture from Copán, Honduras, depicts a scribe with an inkpot fashioned from a conch shell. Excavations at Aguateca uncovered a number of scribal artefacts from the residences of elite status scribes, including palettes and mortars and pestles.|$|E
5|$|That fall, the fourteen-year-old Tatiana {{experienced}} {{her first}} <b>brush</b> <b>with</b> violence when she witnessed {{the assassination of}} the government minister Pyotr Stolypin during a performance at the Kiev Opera House. Tatiana and her older sister Olga had followed their father back to his opera box and witnessed the shooting. Her father later wrote to his mother, Dowager Empress Maria, on 10 September 1911, that the event had upset both girls. Tatiana sobbed and both of them had trouble sleeping that night.|$|E
5|$|Bokhary's first <b>brush</b> <b>with</b> {{the police}} {{was in the}} early hours of 24 June 2001, when the manager of a bar in Central {{district}} of Hong Kong reported to police that she was causing a disturbance. When police officers arrived and attempted to arrest Bokhary, she hit one officer on the cheek; it took four officers at the scene to put her in handcuffs. Police also found a plastic bag with small amounts of cocaine on her person. She was found guilty of the assault and fined HK$9,000 (US$1,153). She was held not guilty of cocaine possession because of doubts over the evidence.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United Football Club is an English {{professional}} football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester. The club was founded as Newton Heath LYR F.C. in 1878 and turned professional in 1885, {{before joining the}} Football League in 1892. After a <b>brush</b> <b>with</b> bankruptcy in 1901, the club reformed as Manchester United in 1902. Manchester United currently play in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. They have not {{been out of the}} top tier since 1975, and they have never been lower than the second tier. They have also been involved in European football ever since they became the first English club to enter the European Cup in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Michelangelo painted {{onto the}} damp plaster using a wash {{technique}} to apply broad areas of colour, {{then as the}} surface became drier, he revisited these areas with a more linear approach, adding shade and detail {{with a variety of}} brushes. For some textured surfaces, such as facial hair and woodgrain, he used a broad <b>brush</b> <b>with</b> bristles as sparse as a comb. He employed all the finest workshop methods and best innovations, combining them with a diversity of brushwork and breadth of skill far exceeding that of the meticulous Ghirlandaio.|$|E
5|$|Command of the Amazon {{then passed}} to Captain Samuel Sutton, who was succeeded the {{following}} year by Captain William Parker. Under Parker, Amazon captured the 16-gun privateer Felix on 26 July 1803, and survived a <b>brush</b> <b>with</b> a French fleet off Cape Capet on 2 May 1804. Amazon {{was one of the}} ships {{to take part in the}} Trafalgar Campaign {{the following year}}, serving with Nelson in the Mediterranean. On one occasion in December 1804 Nelson ordered Parker to bring a consignment of live bullocks to supply the fleet off Toulon. The Amazon was a notably smart ship, and had just been repainted, so presumably the instruction to convert his ship into a floating farmyard was not received with much enthusiasm. Parker duly returned with a shipment, prompting Nelson to enquire with gentle humour 'Well, Parker, of course you would not dirty the Amazon for much for anything; have you brought a dozen and a half, or a dozen?' Parker had in fact brought sixty bullocks and thirty sheep, prompting Nelson to promise a reward for his good service.|$|E

40|$|Aim: This study {{determined}} whether prior <b>brushing</b> <b>with</b> desensitizing toothpastes (Sensodyne Rapid Relief and Colgate Pro-Relief) {{affected the}} shear bond strengths of composite to dentine surfaces after {{appropriate use of}} two different dentine bonding agents (SingleBond and PQ- 1). Materials and Methods: Sixty caries free molar teeth were cleaned, disinfected and embedded in individual cylinders of polymethylmethracyrlate. The occulsal surfaces were flattened to expose dentine and finished down with 600 grit silicone carbide paper. The teeth were randomly divided into six groups of 10 teeth each. Two groups served as control where dentine surfaces were <b>brushed</b> <b>with</b> pumice slurry. Of the remaining 4 groups, 2 groups were <b>brushed</b> <b>with</b> Sensodyne Rapid Relief and 2 groups <b>brushed</b> <b>with</b> Colgate Pro-Relief. The dentine surfaces were brushed to simulate 2 weeks of twice-daily toothpaste use. The specimens {{in each of the}} control groups an...|$|R
5|$|Hearing {{the shark}} has been lured into the pipe, Michael and Kay {{go down to}} repair the {{underwater}} tunnel, so the technicians can restore air pressure and drain the water. Calvin orders the pump {{to be shut down}} to suffocate the shark, but this act instead allows her to break free from the pipe and attack Michael and Kay, but they are saved by the dolphins. They make their way back to the control room, but the shark appears {{in front of the window}} and smashes through the glass, flooding the room and killing a technician. Michael notices FitzRoyce's corpse still in the shark's throat with a grenade, and uses a bent pole to pull its pin, triggering the grenade's explosion and killing the shark. In the aftermath, Mike and Kay celebrate with the dolphins, who survived their <b>brush</b> <b>with</b> the shark.|$|E
5|$|In 1870 republican {{sentiment}} in Britain {{was given a}} boost when the French Emperor, Napoleon III, was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War and the French Third Republic was declared. However, {{in the winter of}} 1871, a <b>brush</b> <b>with</b> death led to an improvement in both Edward's popularity with the public and his relationship with his mother. While staying at Londesborough Lodge, near Scarborough, North Yorkshire, Edward contracted typhoid, the disease that was believed to have killed his father. There was great national concern, and one of his fellow guests (Lord Chesterfield) died. Edward's recovery was greeted with almost universal relief. Public celebrations included the composition of Arthur Sullivan's Festival Te Deum. Edward cultivated politicians from all parties, including republicans, as his friends, and thereby largely dissipated any residual feelings against him.|$|E
5|$|Temeraires one <b>brush</b> <b>with</b> the French {{during this}} period came on 13 August 1811. Having {{received}} orders to sail to Menorca, Spear attempted to tack out of Hyères Bay. As {{he tried to do}} so, the wind fell away, leaving Temeraire becalmed and caught in a current which caused her to drift towards land. She came under fire from a shore battery on Pointe des Medes, which wounded several of her crew. Her boats were quickly manned, and together with boats sent from the squadron, Temeraire was towed out of range of the French guns. She then sailed to Menorca and underwent repairs. During this period an epidemic of yellow fever broke out, infecting nearly the entire crew and killing around a hundred crewmen. Pellew ordered her back to Britain, and health gradually improved as she sailed through the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|In 708, some monks at Hexham accused Bede {{of having}} {{committed}} heresy {{in his work}} De Temporibus. The standard theological view of world history {{at the time was}} known as the Six Ages of the World; in his book, Bede calculated the age of the world for himself, rather than accepting the authority of Isidore of Seville, and {{came to the conclusion that}} Christ had been born 3,952 years after the creation of the world, rather than the figure of over 5,000 years that was commonly accepted by theologians. The accusation occurred in front of the bishop of Hexham, Wilfrid, who was present at a feast when some drunken monks made the accusation. Wilfrid did not respond to the accusation, but a monk present relayed the episode to Bede, who replied within a few days to the monk, writing a letter setting forth his defence and asking that the letter also be read to Wilfrid. Bede had another <b>brush</b> <b>with</b> Wilfrid, for the historian himself says that he met Wilfrid, sometime between 706 and 709, and discussed Æthelthryth, the abbess of Ely. Wilfrid had been present at the exhumation of her body in 695, and Bede questioned the bishop about the exact circumstances of the body and asked for more details of her life, as Wilfrid had been her advisor.|$|E
5|$|The {{captured}} {{ships were}} both purchased into the Royal Navy and recommissioned, Renommée becoming HMS Java and Néréide becoming HMS Madagascar. Nearly four decades later {{the battle was}} among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847. The action {{marked the end of}} the final French attempt to operate in the Indian Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars: with their bases now in British hands, any deployment to the region would require a significant quantity of ships and supplies at a time when France was unable to even protect the entrances to her principal harbours, as Clorindes <b>brush</b> <b>with</b> Tonnant had demonstrated. The action also ended the threat to British merchant ships, especially the large East Indiamen, from attack in the Indian Ocean and the requirement for a significant Royal Navy presence in the region. With {{the exception of a few}} small Dutch ports in the East Indies, the world east of the Cape of Good Hope was now either under British control or in the hands of neutral powers and Britain's allies.|$|E

40|$|Background: Dental plaque {{contributes}} to caries and periodontal disease, therefore efficient plaque removal promotes oral health. We hypothesize that individuals <b>brushing</b> <b>with</b> toothpaste containing plaque-indicating dye will demonstrate higher plaque removal efficacy than those using conventional toothpaste. This study tested plaque removal efficacy between a novel FDA-registered toothpaste with plaque-indicating dye and a control toothpaste without indicating dye. Methods: Thirty-one adult participants {{enrolled in the}} study were randomized and divided into two groups. Control group participants <b>brushed</b> <b>with</b> control toothpaste for two visits. Experimental group participants <b>brushed</b> <b>with</b> control toothpaste for their first visit and <b>brushed</b> <b>with</b> experimental toothpaste (PlaqueHDTM, TJA Health LLC, Joliet, Illinois) for their second visit. Participants brushed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Prior to all visits, participants discontinued oral hygiene for 12 - 16 hours. After <b>brushing,</b> participants rinsed <b>with</b> fluorescein solution and intraoral photographs were taken using an ultraviolet digital camera. The presence of plaque on tooth surfaces was visualized by plaque-bound fluorescein and quantified. Images from both visits were compared using custom software to calculate percentage-change of remaining plaque. Statistics (SPSS version 22. 0) were performed to compare plaque reduction between groups. Results: Participants using the experimental toothpaste demonstrated significantly less plaque remaining between visits (51. 3 % reduction, p= 0. 015) than participants using only the placebo toothpaste (8. 3 % reduction, p= 0. 189). Conclusions: Mechanical plaque removal by <b>brushing</b> <b>with</b> toothpaste containing plaque-indicating dye significantly reduced plaque compared to <b>brushing</b> <b>with</b> toothpaste without dye. This innovative dentifrice may improve oral hygiene and reduce plaque-related damages to teeth and oral tissues...|$|R
