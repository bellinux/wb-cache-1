50|$|Power breaks are breaks {{where the}} {{striking}} object is supported. Either the break will employ human holders for horizontal, angular, or upward vertical strikes, or the break will {{require that the}} objects be stacked for downward vertical strikes. For a stacked break the object is placed on sturdy supporting objects, such as concrete blocks, that are placed on the ground. Many color belt (belts before black belt) promotion testing breaks are power breaks—it is substantially easier for an inexperienced person to muster sufficient energy to break a wooden board with a power break (Note, {{this is not true}} for all breaks). The vast majority of these employ human <b>board</b> <b>holders.</b> Often a stronger or more powerful striker may substitute some strength for technique and successfully accomplish the break. Most records that are catalogued are for power breaks. It is very common for black belt tests to use bricks, concrete patio blocks, or several boards stacked on top of supporting objects for challenging downward strikes.|$|R

50|$|In the United States, {{radiation}} oncologists undergo {{four years}} of residency (in addition to an internship), which is more dedicated oncology training than any other specialty. Currently, radiation oncology is the most competitive specialty for graduating medical students to obtain training in. During the four year post-graduate training, residents learn about clinical oncology, the physics and biology of ionizing radiation, and the treatment of cancer patients with radiation. After completion of this training, a radiation oncologist may undergo certification by either the American Board of Radiology (ABR) or the American Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS) for M.D. degree holders or the American Osteopathic Board of Radiology (AOBR) for D.O. degree <b>holders.</b> <b>Board</b> certification includes a written test and a practical oral exam. Successfully passing these tests leads to the granting of a 10-year, time limited, board certification for ABR diplomates or an 8-year, time limited, board certification for ABPS diplomates. Recertification is obtained via a series of continuing medical education and practice qualifications including a written exam, clinical practice parameter evaluation, continuing medical education credits, and meeting community practice standards.|$|R

40|$|This thesis empirically investigates {{financial}} and investment decisions of banks and bank holding companies in a managerial behavioural approach {{with a view}} to ascertaining to what extent managerial psychology is as important as managerial incentive a determinant affecting the process of instituting an efficient bank governance mechanism. A large sample of US banks and bank holding companies over 1996 - 2006 is examined for the effects of irrational and powerful bank Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). Integrating the analyses of both corporate governance and corporate finance, the thesis uncovers evidence that overconfident, dominating and overconfident-dominating bank CEOs have negative impact on bank financial decisions, such as M&As, payout policy and risk taking as they tend to overestimate their ability and underestimate possible risks of invested projects. Cognitive failures of this origin would have the worst fallout effects when the overconfident CEOs are also dominating the <b>boards.</b> Deploying <b>Holder</b> 67 and CEO-Chair as proxies for overconfidence and dominance factors respectively, the study shows that overconfident, dominating and overconfident-dominating CEOs are more likely to perform mergers with dubious quality, particularly in activity and geography diversifying mergers. The one- and two-year negative post-merger performance of banks ran by overconfident, dominating and overconfident-dominating CEOs bolsters the argument that mergers undertaken by these CEOs are economically undesirable. For the effects of psychological and cognitive biases on bank payout policy, results show that overconfident and overconfident-dominating CEOs are negatively related to the dividend payout ratio and total payout ratio. The negative association becomes stronger when the banks under examination have a higher degree of information asymmetry or with less growth opportunity. Evidence also confirms that CEO overconfidence, dominance and especially overconfidence-dominance have negative effects on bank risk control. CEOs with these attributes have a higher propensity for taking some bank-related risks, such as market-based risk, earnings volatility, credit risk and default risk. Overall, findings of this research suggest the essentiality of taking account of managerial psychological biases in reforming the existing bank governance mechanism, especially in designing appropriate compensation packages for executives and the desirable board composition for banks with overconfident-dominating CEOs.

40|$|Having {{examined}} the complex decision making processes and structures {{in relation to}} the four porticular aspects (i. e. increasing GMS GP provision, allocating appropriate physical infrastructure, improving levels and access to health services and developing a primary health team for the area), this section puts forward some ways that the Primary Health Group Mulhuddart could interact with and influence the main stakeholders in these decision making processes. In order to maximise the possible areas of influence in relation to health provision by the Primary Health Group Mulhuddart (and similar communities foced with the same issues, needs and deficiencies), it is necessary that the other stakeholders including the Northern Area Health Board, Fingal County Council, the Primary Care implementation structures and the Deportment of Health and Children develop effective approaches to community involvement and to collaborative working between stakeholders. It is also necessary for communities to be strategic and to torget the relevant decision making structures in order to present the case for Mulhuddart. Gathering as much evidence as possible to support the case being mode is crucial to the success of these endeavours. To this end, ratios of GPs and other professionals to the population may prove useful, data on morbidity and mortality rates at District Enumeration Division level, as will a detailed health needs assessment of the area. Accessing this type of data will require the co-operation and assistance of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Northern Area Health <b>Board</b> (the current <b>holders</b> of this information at District Enumeration Division and local level) ...|$|R
40|$|Twist is {{currently}} {{one of the}} main quality problems affecting softwood timber for construction. Several methods to minimise this problem were investigated in an EU project. The results for one method, drying boards in a pre-twisted position, are presented in this paper. It has generally been found that boards (Norway spruce) can be deformed towards straightness using this method. The tendency of a board to twist during drying is primarily dependent on the grain angle of the board. Laboratory tests have shown how much a board should be pre-twisted during drying to achieve a straight result. In practice, almost all studs tend to twist in the same direction. Pre-twisting an entire kiln stack equally gives a better average result than the conventional process. By measuring the grain angle for each board (“tracheid effect” with a laser beam), boards can be grouped and then treated “individually”. The force exerted by a <b>board</b> on its <b>holders</b> during drying in a pre-twisted position has been measured. The force decreases considerably during the heating phase, remains constant during the drying phase and decreases during cooling. When the variation in torsional stiffness as a function of temperature and moisture content is accounted for, it is found that creep deformation of the board occurs both during the drying phase and the cooling phase. Deformation due to changes in temperature seems therefore to take place in addition to mechano-sorptive creep. This has been proved by heat treating boards (wet or dry) wrapped in plastic to avoid changes in moisture content. Boards that still show excess twist after drying can therefore be “corrected” using a heat treatment process. It was also shown that boards exhibit a certain degree of memory effect. The wood material seems to remember processes which the board was exposed to at earlier stages. This memory fades over time. The results obtained in the laboratory have been verified by a series of industrial tests, including the testing effect of pre-twist on an entire kiln stack. Recommendations for industrial implementation and an economic assessment are finally presented. Key words: Twist, drying, pre-twist, grain angle, creep, torsional stiffness, memory effect, heat treatment, Norway spruc...|$|R
40|$|Utah {{oil fields}} have {{produced}} a total of 1. 2 billion barrels (191 million m{sup 3 }). However, the 15 million barrels (2. 4 million m{sup 3 }) of production in 2000 was the lowest level in over 40 years and continued the steady decline {{that began in the}} mid- 1980 s. The Utah Geological Survey believes this trend can be reversed by providing play portfolios for the major oil producing provinces (Paradox Basin, Uinta Basin, and thrust belt) in Utah and adjacent areas in Colorado and Wyoming. Oil plays are geographic areas with petroleum potential caused by favorable combinations of source rock, migration paths, reservoir rock characteristics, and other factors. The play portfolios will include: descriptions and maps of the major oil plays by reservoir; production and reservoir data; case-study field evaluations; summaries of the state-of-the-art drilling, completion, and secondary/tertiary techniques for each play; locations of major oil pipelines; descriptions of reservoir outcrop analogs; and identification and discussion of land use constraints. All play maps, reports, databases, and so forth, produced for the project will be published in interactive, menu-driven digital (web-based and compact disc) and hard-copy formats. This report covers research activities for the second quarter of the first project year (October 1 through December 31, 2002). This work included (1) gathering field and pipeline data to produce a digital oil and gas field and pipeline map, and (2) Uinta Basin well database compilation. The oil and gas field map will help to delineate the various oil plays to be described later in the project. The map will also identify CO{sub 2 } resources, and will be useful in the planning and economic evaluation of best practices using CO{sub 2 } to flood mature oil reservoirs. The play descriptions will be enhanced with the updated oil and gas pipeline map. It can be used to plan economic evaluation of exploration activities and field development, particularly if H{sub 2 }S is produced or CO{sub 2 } in needed for best practices. Well databases developed for the project will better define the limits of oil plays in the Uinta Basin and evaluate shows for potential new plays in the basin. Technology transfer activities consisted of a technical presentation to the Utah Stake <b>Holder</b> <b>Board</b> Members belonging to the Uinta Basin Oil and Gas Collaborative Group.
