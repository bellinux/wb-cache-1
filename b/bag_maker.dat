50|$|Brooklynite Robert Gair/Gayer was {{a printer}} and paper <b>bag</b> <b>maker</b> in the 1870s. He invented the {{paperboard}} folding carton by accident: a metal ruler normally used to crease bags shifted in position {{and cut the}} bag. Gair found that by cutting and creasing paperboard in one operation, he could make prefabricated cartons. He ultimately got into the corrugated fiberboard shipping container business in the 1900s. His idea was developed and utilized by E. S. & A.

40|$|Background: Bag {{making is}} a kind of {{occupation}} which comes under unorganized sector. An occupation is always associated with some risk which can account to health hazard. <b>Bag</b> <b>makers</b> are also not an exception to this rule. Objectives: A present study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic determinants and morbidity profile among <b>bag</b> <b>makers.</b> Material and methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in the field practice area (cheetah camp urban health centre) of the T. N. Medical College, Mumbai during the period of March 2008 to August 2009. A total 800 <b>bag</b> <b>makers</b> from cheetah camp area were interviewed and examined. A pre-tested interview tool was used to collect necessary information such as clinical history, socio-demographic profile, clinical examination findings and investigations performed. Results were analysed using Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version - 17. 0. Results: In the present study, out of the 800 study participants taken in to consideration, 95. 9 % were males and 4. 1 % were females. Musculoskeletal problems were most predominant, seen in 76. 3 % participants followed by skin problems (40. 9 %), while 30. 3 % participants presented with gastrointestinal and 17. 3 % with respiratory ailment. Thirty three percent workers had ocular morbidity and injuries were observed in 26. 3 % workers including minor injuries such as cuts and abrasions. Conclusion: In this study, large proportion of workers suffered from work related symptomatic morbidities mainly of musculoskeletal problems, followed by skin, eye, gastrointestinal and respiratory problems. <b>Bag</b> <b>makers</b> should be educated regarding their work related health hazards so that they are detected at the earliest and proper treatment can be initiated...|$|R

40|$|Financial, managerial, {{and medical}} {{decisions}} often involve alternatives whose possible outcomes have uncertain probabilities. In contrast to alternatives whose probabilities are known, these uncertain alternatives offer {{the benefits of}} learning. In repeat-choice situations, such learning brings value. If probabilities appear favorable (unfavorable), a choice can be repeated (avoided). In a series of experiments involving bets on the colors of poker chips drawn from <b>bags,</b> decision <b>makers</b> often prove to be blind to the learning opportunities offered by uncertain probabilities. Such decision makers violate rational decision making and forgo significant expected payoffs when they shun uncertain alternatives in favor of risky ones. Worse, when information is revealed, many make choices contrary to learning. A range of factors explain these violations. The results indicate that priming with optimal strategies offers little improvement. ...|$|R

5000|$|The Batlin case {{rested on}} the copyrightability of an [...] "Uncle Sam" [...] toy bank, first copyrighted in 1886. These toys have Uncle Sam's {{extended}} arm and outstretched hand adapted to receive a coin; when the user presses a lever, Uncle Sam appears to put the coin into a carpet <b>bag.</b> One <b>maker</b> of these banks, Jeffrey Snyder, had filed a copyright on such a bank in 1975, planning to import them for the American Bicentennial. Shortly thereafter, another company, L. Batlin & Sons, Inc., also began making a very similar toy bank {{which was based on}} Snyder's version (and not, incidentally, on the 19th century original). When the latter attempted to import the toy banks, the US Customs service notified them that they appeared to be infringing on Snyder's copyright, and would not allow the toy banks to be imported. Batlin then got an injunction against Snyder to deny the recording of his copyright and allowing them to import their banks. On appeal to the Second Circuit Court, Snyder took great pains to demonstrate how his banks varied in size and shape from the 19th century original, arguing that his banks, though similar to the older work, differed in a number of significant ways and warranted protection under a new copyright. However, his appeal was denied and the injunction against Snyder's copyright upheld (six members of the court voted to deny, the other three filing a dissenting opinion). Much of this decision focused on the fact that nearly all of the alterations in Snyder's version were made solely to allow the object to be more easily manufactured in plastic rather than metal, and therefore were functional, not artistic or creative. [...] "To extend copyrightability to minuscule variations would simply put a weapon for harassment in the hands of mischievous copiers intent on appropriating and monopolizing public domain work." [...] The issue was not whether or not Batlin's bank was a copy of Snyder's— it undoubtedly was— but whether or not Snyder could claim copyright protection, which the court decided he could not.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{symbolic}} steps {{of the environmental movement}} has been the banning of the plastic bag, while promoting the use of another symbol of the environmental crusade, the reusable <b>bag.</b> Policy <b>makers</b> both locally and nationally feel that plastic bag bans and taxes are {{a step in the right}} direction and if accepted will pave the way for further environmental regulations. However, the banning and promotion of certain bags can create confusion and stress on the environmentally-conscious consumer. This research seeks to inform the environmentally- conscious consumer about the life cycles of shopping bags. To allow the consumer to make an informed decision, the life cycles of a conventional plastic bag, paper bag and {{the symbolic}} “Go Green” reusable bag were researched from cradle to grave. This includes the use of resources in the production process, length of use of the bag, recycling methods, landfill statistics and the total carbon foot print associated with each bag type. The life cycle information can then be used by the informed voter in regards to plastic bag bans and taxes. By comparing the three major bag types it becomes clear that all have their own environmental problems. Ultimately, what determines the environmental impact of any bag type is the amount of resources used in the production process. The best way to reduce this environmental impact is to reuse a bag as many times as possible no matter what type. This research shows that based on production alone a conventional plastic bag requires the least amount of resources and energy to produce, while paper and reusable bags require more. On the flip side, a plastic bag can take up to a thousand years to break down in the environment, which greatly increases its potential to create environmental harm. Based on the life cycles and total carbon footprints of each bag type there is little rationale in limiting their usage due to the threat of climate change. When the carbon footprints of consumer bags are compared to the carbon footprints of other current practices the bags rank trivial, meaning the carbon footprint of consumer shopping bags is low. Positive or negative this symbolic movement puts environmental issues on the public’s radar and allows for other issues to gain attention...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Economic Sciences, Washington State UniversityThe {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} optimal choices for plastic products end-user and manufacturers {{in the context}} of environmental and the sustainable development concerns. Additionally, it will help to understand the formation of environmentally friendly norms, the adoption of environmentally friendly biodegradable plastics and effective risk management in the plastics industry. Three independent but related papers make up this dissertation. We first study the consumers and retailers' use of plastic shopping bags. A theoretical model is developed to establish a context for analysis of stores' voluntary rewards programs that encourage consumers to use reusable bags instead of plastic bags. This research characterizes the behavior of stores and consumers, especially the external effect of participation, as well as economic environments for the broader application of the model. The results show that voluntary reward programs can increase store profits and help reduce the use of plastic <b>bags,</b> providing policy <b>makers</b> with an alternative to bans and taxation. The second paper studies agricultural plastics use. In order to investigate the adoption of conventional (polyethylene) and biodegradable plastic mulches as well as their long-term environmental consequences in sustainable agriculture, a growers' decision model is developed. We theoretically show that growers integrating plastic waste management into their production decision making procedure help to achieve the long-tern stable amount of on-site plastic mulch residual. We find that increasing landfill tipping fees and decreasing tomato market prices would result in cessation of the use of polyethylene plastic mulches, but only one among three biodegradable plastic mulch brands is worth switching to replace polyethylene plastic mulches assisting the tomato production in Washington. The third paper explores the long-term price linkage and price volatility transmission among plastics, their conventional feedstock (crude oil) and the newly-developed feedstock (corn) markets in the United States. We confirm the causal relationship from the crude oil futures market to the corn futures and plastics market, and reveal significant volatility spillovers from the crude oil futures market to the corn futures and plastics market as well as the importance of Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.
