5000|$|The film {{originally}} {{featured a}} scene in which an Iranian is murdered by her brother in an honor killing. Following complaints that the plotline was unrealistic and offensive, the killing was presented as an intended <b>beating-up</b> which got out of hand, removing the dialogue referring to [...] "honor" [...] and [...] "family honor".|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{supposed}} that Ballard's {{exposure to the}} atrocities of war at an impressionable age explains the apocalyptic and violent nature of much of his fiction. Martin Amis wrote that Empire of the Sun [...] "gives shape to what shaped him." [...] However, Ballard's own account of the experience was more nuanced: [...] "I don't think you can go through the experience of war without one's perceptions of the world being forever changed. The reassuring stage set that everyday reality in the suburban west presents to us is torn down; you see the ragged scaffolding, {{and then you see}} the truth beyond that, and it can be a frightening experience." [...] But also: [...] "I have—I won't say happy—not unpleasant memories of the camp. [...] I remember a lot of the casual brutality and <b>beatings-up</b> that went on—but {{at the same time we}} children were playing a hundred and one games all the time!" [...] Ballard later became an atheist.|$|R
500|$|Writing in The Times Literary Supplement, Phillip Stead {{thought that}} Fleming [...] "continues uninhibitedly to deploy his story-telling talents {{within the limits}} of the Commander Bond formula." [...] Stead saw that the {{hijacking}} of the two bombs [...] "gives Bond some anxiety but, needless to say, does not prevent him from having a good deal of fun in luxury surroundings", whilst [...] "the usual <b>beatings-up,</b> modern style, are ingeniously administered to lady and gentleman like". As to why the novels were so appealing, Stead considered that [...] "Mr. Fleming's special magic lies in his power to impart sophistication to his mighty nonsense; his fantasies connect with up-to-date and lively knowledge of places and of the general sphere of crime and espionage." [...] Overall, in Stead's opinion, with Thunderball [...] "the mixture, exotic as ever, generates an extravagant and exhilarating tale and Bond connoisseurs will be glad to have it." [...] The critic for The Times wrote that Thunderball [...] "relies for its kicks far less than did Dr. No or Goldfinger on sadism and a slightly condescending sophistication." [...] The upshot, in the critic's opinion, was that [...] "the mixture—of good living, sex and violent action—is as before, but this is a highly polished performance, with an ingenious plot well documented and plenty of excitement." ...|$|R
50|$|The warp {{is divided}} into two {{overlapping}} groups, or lines (most often adjacent threads belonging to the opposite group) that run in two planes, one above another, so the shuttle can be passed between them in a straight motion. Then, the upper group is lowered by the loom mechanism, and the lower group is raised (shedding), allowing to pass the shuttle in the opposite direction, also in a straight motion. Repeating these actions form a fabric mesh but without <b>beating-up,</b> the final distance between the adjacent wefts would be irregular and far too large.|$|E

In {{order to}} realize the {{parametric}} design of the conjugate cam <b>beating-up</b> mechanism, {{on the basis of}} the technological parameters of <b>beating-up</b> mechanism, ideal kinematical curves of the <b>beating-up</b> mechanism are builded, and the mathematical model of reverse solution for this mechanism is established. The parameters of this <b>beating-up</b> mechanism are obtained by reverse solution according to the kinematic requirements and the constructed ideal kinematic curves. The secondary development of UG is conducted based on VB. NET, the parametric design platform which is integrated with the functions of parametric reverse solution, motion simulation, three-dimensional modeling and virtual assembly is built.

40|$|Abstract. A non-circular {{planetary}} gears train <b>beating-up</b> mechanism was proposed, the ideal kinematic curve of <b>beating-up</b> rockshaft was constructed and the reverse {{model of the}} pitch curve of non-circular gears was established based on the ideal kinematic curve. When the first-level non-circular gears were set as elliptical gears, the maximum swinging angle of the sley {{and the influence of}} the elliptical gears ' eccentricity on the concavo-convex characteristic of the second-level non-circular gears were analyzed. Provided with a set of parameters, the pitch curves and tooth profiles of the second-level non-circular gears were determined by reverse method. The result has shown that non-circular {{planetary gears}} train <b>beating-up</b> mechanism can meet the requirements of <b>beating-up</b> process...|$|E

In particular, it compares and contrasts the sources for two such minor operations - the skirmish at Myddle in Shropshire {{sometime in the}} autumn or winter of 1644 - 45 {{and the pursuit of}} the royalist Lord Forth, his carriage train and lifeguard shortly after the second battle of Newbury in October 1644 - and evaluates both their reliability and what they reveal {{about the nature of the}} civil war...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringYouqi WangTextile {{fabrics and}} textile {{composite}} materials demonstrate exceptional mechanical properties, including high stiffness, high {{strength to weight}} ratio, damage tolerance, chemical resistance, high temperature tolerance and low thermal expansion. Recent advances in weaving techniques have caused various textile fabrics to gain applications in high performance products, such as aircrafts frames, aircrafts engine blades, ballistic panels, helmets, aerospace components, racing car bodies, net-shape joints and blood vessels. Fabric mechanical properties are determined by fabric internal architectures and fabric micro-geometries {{are determined by the}} textile manufacturing process. As the need for high performance textile materials increases, textile preforms with improved thickness and more complex structures are designed and manufactured. Therefore, the study of textile fabrics requires a reliable and efficient CAD/CAM tool that models fabric micro-geometry through computer simulation and links the manufacturing process with fabric micro-geometry, mechanical properties and weavability. Dynamic Weaving Process Simulation is developed to simulate the entire textile process. It employs the digital element approach to simulate weaving actions, reed motion, boundary tension and fiber-to-fiber contact and friction. Dynamic Weaving Process Simulation models a Jacquard loom machine, in which the weaving process primarily consists of four steps: weft insertion, beating up, weaving and taking up. Dynamic Weaving Process Simulation simulates these steps according to the underlying loom kinematics and kinetics. First, a weft yarn moves to the fell position under displacement constraints, followed by a <b>beating-up</b> action performed by reed elements. Warp yarns then change positions according to the yarn interlacing pattern defined by a weaving matrix, and taking-up action is simulated to collect woven fabric for continuous weaving process simulation. A Jacquard loom machine individually controls each warp yarn for maximum flexibility of warp motion, managed by the weaving matrix in simulation. Constant boundary tension is implemented to simulate the spring at each warp end. In addition, process simulation adopts re-mesh function to store woven fabric and add new weft yarns for continuous weaving simulation. Dynamic Weaving Process Simulation fully models loom kinetics and kinematics involved in the weaving process. However, the step-by-step simulation of the 3 D weaving process requires additional calculation time and computer resource. In order to promote simulation efficiency, enable finer yarn discretization and improve accuracy of fabric micro geometry, parallel computing is implemented in this research and efficiency promotion is presented in this dissertation. The Dynamic Weaving Process Simulation model links fabric micro-geometry with the manufacturing process, allowing determination of weavability of specific weaving pattern and process design. Effects of various weaving process parameters on fabric micro-geometry, fabric mechanical properties and weavability can be investigated with the simulation method...|$|E
