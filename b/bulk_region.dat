50|$|The Heterojunction-emitter bipolar {{transistor}} (HEBT), is a somewhat unusual arrangement {{with respect to}} emitter blocking of minority carriers. This is accomplished by using heterostructure confinement in the emitter, introducing an energy barrier to minority-carrier charge flow from the base. This is important as loss of minority carriers from the base to the emitter degrades analog performance. The main difference of the HEBT from the Heterojunction {{bipolar transistor}} (HBT) is that the emitter-base interface {{is the same as}} in a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) with the blocking energy gap being moved back into the emitter <b>bulk</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{interplay between}} spin and charge {{transport}} in electrically and magnetically inhomogeneous semiconductor systems is investigated theoretically. In particular, {{the theory of}} spin-polarized bipolar transport in magnetic p-n junctions is formulated, generalizing the classic Shockley model. The theory assumes that in the depletion layer the nonequilibrium chemical potentials of spin up and spin down carriers are constant and carrier recombination and spin relaxation are inhibited. Under the general conditions of an applied bias and externally injected (source) spin, the model formulates analytically carrier and spin transport in magnetic p-n junctions at low bias. The evaluation of the carrier and spin densities at the depletion layer establishes the necessary boundary conditions for solving the diffusive transport equations in the <b>bulk</b> <b>regions</b> separately, thus greatly simplifying the problem. The carrier and spin density and current profiles in the <b>bulk</b> <b>regions</b> are calculated and the I-V characteristics of the junction are obtained. It is demonstrated that spin injection through the depletion layer of a magnetic p-n junction is not possible unless nonequilibrium spin accumulates in the <b>bulk</b> <b>regions</b> [...] either by external spin injection or by {{the application of a}} large bias. Implications of the theory for majority spin injection across the depletion layer, minority spin pumping and spin amplification, giant magnetoresistance, spin-voltaic effect, biasing electrode spin injection, and magnetic drift in the <b>bulk</b> <b>regions</b> are discussed in details, and illustrated using the example of a GaAs based magnetic p-n junction.

40|$|In this paper, {{we define}} a new {{finite element method}} for numerically {{approximating}} the solution of a partial differential equation in a <b>bulk</b> <b>region</b> coupled with a surface partial differential equation posed on the boundary of the bulk domain.

We study this method {{in the context of a}} model elliptic problem; in particular, we look at well-posedness of the system using a variational formulation, derive perturbation estimates arising from domain approximation and apply these to find the optimal-order error estimates.

This mechanism is found to essentially originate from the non-zero mean shear in the <b>bulk</b> <b>region</b> of the Couette flow, and involves eddy turn-over dynamics remarkably similar to the so-called self-sustaining process (SSP) and/or vortex–wave interaction (VWI). A numerical experiment that removes all other motions except in the core region is also performed, which demonstrates that the eddies at a given wall-normal location in the <b>bulk</b> <b>region</b> are sustained in the absence of other motions at different wall-normal locations. It is proposed that the self-sustaining eddies at the Kolmogorov microscale correspond to those in uniform shear turbulence at transitional Reynolds numbers, and a quantitative comparison between the eddies in uniform shear and near-wall turbulence is subsequently made. Finally, it is shown that turbulence production by the self-sustaining eddies at the Kolmogorov microscale is much smaller than that of full-scale simulations, and that {{the difference between the two}} increases with Reynolds number...|$|E

In this situation,a panbolic scaling reduces the equadon to another singularly perturbed equation for which we also establish convergence of solutions in the singular limit.

The interface is coupled to two different semi-infinite <b>bulk</b> <b>regions,</b> and the Green's function for interface-interface, bulk-interface and bulk-bulk interactions are computed individually. The elastic bicrystal Green's function and the bulk lattice Green's function give the interaction between <b>bulk</b> <b>regions.</b> We make use of partial Fourier transforms to treat in-plane periodicity.

30|$|Similarly, {{the use of}} TEOS causes {{facilitated}} diffusion of silica source into the <b>bulk</b> <b>region</b> {{because it is more}} hydrophilic than the TBOS. This {{facilitated diffusion}} accelerates the spread of TEOS in the water phase. Unlike the unidirectional supply of TBOS, TEOS becomes supplied from all directions, causing the growth of 3 D particulate gyroidal shapes to be much like those prepared under mixing conditions. They have poor structure reflected by the loose micellar packing in the <b>bulk</b> <b>region.</b> In earlier quiescent interfacial studies, fibers were prepared from TEOS by dissolving it in a hydrophobic solvent (e.g., hexane) [32, 36]. This reduces the diffusion of TEOS and gives linear supply and linear shapes in agreement with our suggestion of slow vs. facilitated diffusion. We have recently demonstrated that mixing of the water phase while quiescent interfacial growth using TBOS alters the linear supply of TBOS and leads to gyroidal shapes [47]. When employing a neutral surfactant, growth shifts to the <b>bulk</b> <b>region</b> both for TBOS and TEOS sources. It is not well understood why growth becomes faster than the ionic surfactants (CTAB), but the simultaneous effect of low binding of S 0 H+X−I+ and the fast condensation (driven by facilitated diffusion and low pH) ends up with irregular shapes of disordered structures.|$|E

40|$|The {{numerical}} {{approximation of}} non-isothermal liquid-vapor flow within the compressible regime {{is a difficult}} task because complex physical effects at the phase interfaces can govern the global flow behavior. We present a sharp interface approach which treats the interface as a shock-wave like discontinuity. Any mixing of fluid phases is avoided by using the flow solver in the <b>bulk</b> <b>regions</b> only, and a ghost-fluid approach close to the interface. The coupling states for the numerical solution in the <b>bulk</b> <b>regions</b> {{are determined by the}} solution of local multi-phase Riemann problems across the interface. The Riemann solution accounts for the relevant physics by enforcing appropriate jump conditions at the phase boundary. A wide variety of interface effects can be handled in a thermodynamically consistent way. This includes surface tension or mass/energy transfer by phase transition. Moreover, the local normal speed of the interface, which is needed to calculate the time evolution of the interface, is given by the Riemann solution. The interface tracking itself is based on a level-set method. The focus in this paper is the description of the multi-phase Riemann solver and its usage within the sharp interface approach. One-dimensional problems are selected to validate the approach. Finally, the three-dimensional simulation of a wobbling droplet and a shock droplet interaction in two dimensions are shown. In both problems phase transition and surface tension determine the global bulk behavior...|$|R

Under a weak magnetic field (ω_cω_ 0, ω_c being a cyclotron frequency) and at low temperature (Tħω_ 0), where the orbital magnetic moment fluctuates {{as a function of}} the field, the currents are irregularly distributed paramagnetically or diamagnetically inside the <b>bulk</b> <b>region.</b> As the temperature is raised under such a weak field, however, the currents in the <b>bulk</b> <b>region</b> are immediately reduced and finally there only remains the diamagnetic current flowing along the edge.

40|$|I {{show that}} the {{gravitational}} dynamics in a <b>bulk</b> <b>region</b> of space can be connected to a thermodynamic description in the boundary of that region, thereby providing clear physical interpretations of several mathematical features of classical general relativity: (1) The Noether charge contained in a <b>bulk</b> <b>region,</b> associated with a specific time evolution vector field, has a direct thermodynamic interpretation as the gravitational heat content of the boundary surface. (2) This result, in turn, shows that all static spacetimes maintain holographic equipartition; in these spacetimes, the number of degrees of freedom in the boundary {{is equal to the}} number of degrees of freedom in the bulk. (3) In a general, evolving spacetime, the rate of change of gravitational momentum is related to the difference between the number of bulk and boundary degrees of freedom. It is this departure from the holographic equipartition which drives the time evolution of the spacetime. (4) When the equations of motion hold, the (naturally defined) total energy of the gravity plus matter within a <b>bulk</b> <b>region,</b> will be equal to the boundary heat content. (5) After motivating the need for an alternate description of gravity (if we have to solve the cosmological constant problem), I describe a thermodynamic variational principle based on null surfaces to achieve this goal. The concept of gravitational heat density of the null surfaces arises naturally from the Noether charge associated with the null congruence. The null surface variational principle, in fact, extremises the total heat content of the matter plus gravity system. Several variations on this theme and implications are described.
