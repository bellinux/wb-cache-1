40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} <b>bribery</b> <b>offences</b> which {{constitute}} {{the core of}} the criminal law prosecution of corruption in our country. Initially, the text discusses the notion of corruption and bribery, then it deals with the development of legislation in this area from 1852 to the present time. The paper also analyses the consequences of changes in the concept of criminal offence under the current Criminal Code (Act No. 40 / 2009 Coll.) in comparison with the previous one (Act No. 140 / 1961 Coll.). Attention should be given mainly to the fact that formalizing the concept of crime did not bring desired clarification to the facts of crime of the criminal <b>bribery</b> <b>offences.</b> The goal of this diploma thesis is a deeper analysis of the current regulation concerning <b>bribery</b> <b>offences.</b> The Criminal Code which is currently in force recognizes crimes of Accepting Bribes, Bribery and Indirect Corruption. The core part of this work presents an analysis of key notions in the field of <b>bribery</b> <b>offences</b> such as bribe, general interest, official and business person. The text also contains a treatise on the regulation of <b>bribery</b> <b>offences</b> in the Slovak Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. In conclusion, there are presented some proposals de lege ferenda, which are based on a detailed analysis of the Czech [...] ...|$|R
40|$|THESIS 10549 The <b>bribery</b> <b>offences</b> are a much {{neglected}} area of law, {{both from}} an academic {{and from a}} practical perspective. Although the existing statutory offences can trace their origins to {{the dawn of the}} twentieth century, there has been no substantive academic attempt to analyse those offences in order to determine their precise contours and scope or to assess whether they meet the needs of a modern bribery law. This thesis remedies these lacunae, focusing on the <b>bribery</b> <b>offences</b> contained in the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906, as amended. In particular it considers whether the agent principal model underlying the 1906 Act is capable of meeting the needs of a modern bribery law and, {{to the extent that it}} is not, whether those needs could be more effectively met through reliance on the broader breach of duty model of bribery. For the purposes of analysing the <b>bribery</b> <b>offences</b> and determining the requirements of a modern bribery law, this thesis relies on two primary sources. The first is the reports published by the Tribunals of Inquiry established, towards the end of the last century, to inquire into possible instances of political corruption. These reports run to thousands of pages in length and, in the absence of written case-law, comprise the only comprehensive existing source of information on the typologies of Irish bribery. Like the <b>bribery</b> <b>offences</b> themselves, the Tribunal?s reports have been largely ignored by the academic community...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} attempts, {{all over the}} world, to address bribery with {{recourse}} to criminal law. As many other countries, Vietnam has been doing activities that show the determination of combating and controlling corruption, including strengthening penal provisions in terms of bribery. However, the situation of bribery in Vietnam is still alarming. For Vietnamese law enforcement authorities, criminal provisions concerning bribery are neither adequate nor clear. Analysis starts with both theoretical and practical issues relating to such offences. The understanding of <b>bribery</b> <b>offences</b> {{in the light of}} criminal law is addressed in the idea that the concept of bribery should be perceived in a modern and broad approach to include bribery in the private sector, bribery of foreign public officials; and the criminalization of different types of bribery is dependent on social attitude towards the phenomenon and the need of protecting values concerning not only government system but also private interests. Relevant international standards are analyzed respectively. The research then examines the existing criminal law of Vietnam regarding <b>bribery</b> <b>offences</b> in comparison with that of Swedish and Australia. Domestic laws on bribery indicate the considerable consistency with relevant criminal law theories. However, bribery provisions in Vietnamese Penal Code exist gaps relating to relevant Convention, including lacks of bribery in the private sector and bribery of foreign public officials. Consequently, recommendations both in building comprehensive elements of crimes and setting proportionate sanctions for crimes are made for the amendments of Vietnamese Penal Code...|$|R

It has a broad jurisdiction, though most of its cases involve <b>bribery</b> <b>offences.</b> [...] In 2001, a high-profile corruption case emerged when the then Deputy Chief of the Economic Police was arrested for receiving a bribe in an attempt to prevent the investigation of a smuggling and tax evasion case.|$|R
40|$|Local and {{international}} {{public opinion polls}} suggest that Australia is a low-risk country in terms of corruption. This article challenges this reputation contending that the relative invisibility of corruption in Australia {{is the result of}} low levels of enforcement of existing laws, and the political failure to implement a co-ordinated national strategy against corruption. As a result, Australia has become increasingly vulnerable to corrupt overseas politicians seeking a safe haven for their illicit assets. These enforcement vulnerabilities extend also to cases of foreign bribery perpetrated offshore by Australian corporations, employees and agents. Enforcement of foreign <b>bribery</b> <b>offences</b> in Australia, unlike the equivalent United Kingdom offences, is hampered by an overly broad defence which excuses "facilitation payments" that otherwise would constitute acts of bribery. The conclusion is that an urgent review of the effectiveness and scope of anti-corruption laws is needed, combined with a much stronger political and law enforcement commitment to tackle corruption at home and abroa...|$|R

40|$|In Hungary {{there is}} a wide range of acts of {{corruption}} forbidden by criminal law. As of 1 April 2002 the measures of penal law applicable in the crackdown on corruption were further extended. In the Hungarian Criminal Code the system of corruption offences are as follows: bribery (official bribery, economic bribery, bribery in connection with hindering of official procedure), failure to report bribery, trading in influence, persecution of a conveyor of an announcement of public concern, crimes against the propriety of international affairs. Furthermore passive forms of bribery are traditionally judged more strictly than active bribery patterns. As regards the comparison of official and economic bribery, the degree of penal law sanctioning gradually came closer time to time. The criminal law regulation on bribery in international relations was introduced by Act of 1998 with due consideration to the OECD's Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. The sanctioning of <b>bribery</b> <b>offences</b> committed in national and international relationships is very similar in the Hungarian Criminal Code. ...|$|R

500|$|Bribery {{of foreign}} public {{officials}} {{is a distinct}} crime under Section 6, {{in line with the}} OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. A person will be guilty of this offence if they promise, offer or give a financial or other advantage to a foreign public official, either directly or through a third party, where such an advantage is not legitimately due. A foreign public official is defined, under Section 6(4), as [...] " [...] an individual holding legislative, administrative or judicial posts or anyone carrying out a public function for a foreign country or the country's public agencies or an official or agent of a public international organisation". The inclusion of [...] "through a third party" [...] is intended to prevent the use of go-betweens to avoid committing a crime, although if the written law of the country of the foreign public official allows or requires the official to accept the advantage offered, no crime will be committed. Unlike with general <b>bribery</b> <b>offences,</b> there is no requirement to show that the public official acted improperly as a result; this is a distinction between the Act and the Anti-Bribery Convention. The offence under Section 6 only applies to the briber, and not to the official who receives or agrees to receive such a bribe.|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the question of}} to what extent companies can be held criminally liable for – active – <b>bribery</b> <b>offences</b> perpetrated by their employees. It focuses on the questions of to what extent companies have a duty of care to prevent bribery by employees {{and to what extent}} can a breach of such a duty of care cause criminal liability to ensue. In this contribution, the authors set out to answer these questions by comparing the Dutch and the British legal systems. After assessing the international and national legal frameworks, they conclude that the Dutch anti-corruption provisions are, compared to the British, broadly formulated, including ambiguous terms and that – {{as a result of this}} – their scope is somewhat vague. Due diligence measures have a varying effect on determining the criminal liability of companies. In contrast, the due diligence question has a fixed, unequivocal place in the UK system of determining criminal liability, making the UK system seem more straightforward. But still, neither anti-corruption legislation nor case law provides clarity as to the scope of due diligence measures. To increase legal certainty, this article calls upon the Dutch Government to produce guidelines, similar to the British MoJ Guidance, that provide specific examples of the details of a compliance scheme...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the Poulson affair of the early 1970 s. In so doing it examines two areas in particular. First, {{the role of the}} bankruptcy law public examination procedure in exposing Cabinet level involvement in the corrupt practices of the bankrupt architect, John Garlick Llewellyn Pouslon. In the course of his 1972 bankruptcy proceedings, in Wakefield, it emerged that Poulson had used, through one of his companies, the services of Reginald Maudling MP, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, and at the time of Poulson's bankruptcy Home Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister in Edward Heath's government. As a result of his involvement in Poulson's affairs Maudling was compelled to resign as Home Secretary. In {{the course of the next}} three years or so Poulson, T. Dan Smith, Pottinger and several others were convicted of <b>bribery</b> <b>offences</b> in the Leeds Crown Court and sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment. The second main area examined in this article highlights the attempt to curtail the public examination of Poulson through the undermining of the trustee in bankruptcy’s silk, namely, Mr Muir Hunter QC. In examining the bankruptcy public examination procedure the article tests whether the demise in the importance of public examinations has harmed the effectiveness and social benefit of English and Welsh personal insolvency law...|$|R

50|$|The {{results of}} these reports and {{perception}} surveys suggest that whilst there is instances of corruption within Luxembourg, the country's assessment by the European Union suggests that mechanisms exist to combat these instances and promote ethical behaviour {{on the part of}} public officials. Whilst Luxembourg lacks a specific anti corruption strategy, soft law instruments such as the quasi-legal instruments of organisations like the European Union, inform judicial bodies and government officials when prosecuting. In recent years, their Anti Corruption framework has had a particular focus on efficient control of public institutions such as police and government bodies to avoid anti corrupt behaviours in these sectors. Criminal law was last amended in 2011 to accommodate anti-corruption legislation, although the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) recommended in August 2014 that more reform needed to implemented to modify their criminal policy framework (due to gaps in legislation regarding foreign <b>bribery</b> <b>offences).</b> Positively, an inter-ministerial committee, the Corruption Prevention Committee, was established in 2007 and meets annually, which shows a conscious effort on behalf of the country to keep anti corruption mechanisms on the forefront. A hotline has also been established which is run by Transparency International in Luxembourg. This hotline is an avenue for members of the public to submit claims of corruption and is a useful anti corruption mechanism employed by Luxembourg.|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the criminological {{significance}} of crime reporting. The first part {{deals with the}} issues of latent crime, the part of crime which stays hidden. It describes the possibilities and limits of crime recording and the reasons why {{a significant part of}} crime stays in the so called dark area of crime and gets never discovered by police. The most significant cause of latent crime seems to be the non- reporting behavior of victims. The second part closely looks at the non-reporting behavior of victims and describes the individual factors, which lead to the decision to not report a crime to the police. First and nearly most important factor described is the cost and benefit theory. Second factor that the thesis is dealing with is the trust in police in a specific territory. Third factor is the influence of neighborhood in which the victim lives and fourth is the influence of victim's age. Fifth factor described in this thesis is the gender of the offender, primarily the fact, that crimes committed by women get reported less than crime committed by men.
