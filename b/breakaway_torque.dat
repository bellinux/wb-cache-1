5000|$|Torque {{measurement}} {{is conducted}} {{in the same way}} as with an electronic torque wrench but the tightening angle from the snug point or threshold is also measured. The angle is measured by an angle sensor or electronic gyroscope. The angle measurement process enables joints which have already been tightened to be recognised. The inbuilt readings memory enables measurements to be statistically evaluated. Tightening curves can be analysed using the software via the integrated tightening-curve system (force/path graph). This type of torque wrench can also be used to determine <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque,</b> prevail torque and the final torque of a tightening job. Thanks to a special measuring process, it is also possible to display the yield point (yield controlled tightening). This design of torque wrench is highly popular with automotive manufacturers for documenting tightening processes requiring both torque and angle control because, in these cases, a defined angle has to be applied to the fastener on top of the prescribed torque (e.g. [...] + 90° - here the [...] means the snug point/threshold and +90° indicates that an additional angle has to be applied after the threshold). Saltus-Werk Max Forst GmbH applied in 1995 for an international patent for the first electronic torque wrench with angle measurement which did not require a reference arm.|$|E

The flowmeter and bearings were tested in liquid hydrogen to simulate the flowmeter's operating environment as closely as possible. Based on the results from this testing, the bearings with the existing cage material are equivalent to the bearings with the proposed replacement cage material.

The {{aim of the}} study was to identify sites within the pathway of iliosacral screws requiring modifications of the local bone or the design of instrumentations placed at this site. MATERIALS AND METHODS The <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque</b> was measured mechanically at the iliosacral joint ("ISJ"), the sacral lateral mass ("SLM") and the center of the S 1 ("CS 1 "), at a superior and an inferior site under fluoroscopic control on five human cadaveric specimens (3 female; mean age 87  years, range: 76 - 99) using the DensiProbe™Spine device. RESULTS The measured median (range) <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque</b> was 0. 63 Nm (0. 31 - 2. 52) at the "iliosacral joint", 0. 14 Nm (0. 05 - 1. 22) at the "sacral lateral mass", 0. 57 Nm (0. 05 - 1. 42) at the "S 1 center. " The "sacral lateral mass" <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque</b> was lower than compared to that at the "iliosacral joint" (p <. 001) or "S 1 center" (p <. 001). The median (range) <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque</b> measured at all superior measurement points was 0. 52 Nm (0. 10 - 2. 52), and 0. 48 Nm (0. 05 - 1. 18) at all inferior sites. The observed difference was statistically significant (p <. 05). CONCLUSIONS The lateral mass of the sacrum provides the lowest bone quality for implant anchorage. Iliosacral screws should be placed as superior as safely possible, should bridge the iliosacral joint and may allow for cement application at the lateral mass of the sacrum through perforations...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND CONTEXT A new device, DensiProbe, {{has been}} {{developed}} to provide surgeons with intraoperative information about bone strength by measuring the peak <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque.</b> In cases of low bone quality, the treatment {{can be adapted to}} the patient's condition, for example, by improving screw-anchorage with augmentation techniques. PURPOSE The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the feasibility of DensiProbe Spine in patients undergoing transpedicular fixation. STUDY DESIGN Prospective feasibility study on consecutive patients. PATIENT SAMPLE Fourteen women and 16 men were included in this study. OUTCOME MEASURES Local and general bone quality. METHODS These consecutive patients scheduled for transpedicular fixation were evaluated for bone mineral density (BMD), which was measured globally by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and locally via biopsies using quantitative microcomputed tomography. The <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque</b> force within the vertebral body was assessed intraoperatively via the transpedicular approach with the DensiProbe Spine. The results were correlated with the areal BMD at the lumbar spine and the local volumetric BMD (vBMD) and a subjective impression of bone strength. The feasibility of the method was evaluated, and the clinical and radiological performance was evaluated over a 1 -year follow-up. This study was funded by an AO Spine research grant; DensiProbe was developed at the AO Research Institute Davos, Switzerland; the AO Foundation is owner of the intellectual property rights. RESULTS In 30 patients, 69 vertebral levels were examined. The <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque</b> consistently correlated with an experienced surgeon's quantified impression of resistance as well as with vBMD of the same vertebra. Beyond a marginal prolongation of surgery time, no adverse events related to the usage of the device were observed. CONCLUSIONS The intraoperative transpedicular measurement of the peak <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque</b> was technically feasible, safe, and reliably predictive of local vBMD during dorsal spinal instrumentations in a clinical setting.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN. : Cadaver study. OBJECTIVE. : To {{determine}} {{bone strength}} in vertebrae by measuring peak <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque</b> or indentation force using custom-made pedicle probes. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. : Screw performance in dorsal spinal instrumentation {{is dependent on}} bone quality of the vertebral body. To date no intraoperative measuring device to validate bone strength is available. Destructive testing may predict bone strength in transpedicular instrumentations in osteoporotic vertebrae. Insertional torque measurements showed varying results. METHODS. : Ten human cadaveric vertebrae were evaluated for bone mineral density (BMD) measurements by quantitative computed tomography. Peak torque and indentation force of custom-made probes as a measure for mechanical bone strength were assessed via a transpedicular approach. The results were correlated to regional BMD and to biomechanical load testing after pedicle screw implementation. RESULTS. : Both methods generated a positive correlation to failure load of the respective vertebrae. The correlation of peak <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque</b> to failure load was r = 0. 959 (P = 0. 003), therewith distinctly higher than the correlation of indentation force to failure load, which was r = 0. 690 (P = 0. 040). In predicting regional BMD, measurement of peak torque also performed better than that of indentation force (r = 0. 897 [P = 0. 002] vs. r = 0. 777 [P = 0. 017]). CONCLUSION. : Transpedicular measurement of peak <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque</b> is technically feasible and predicts reliable local bone strength and implant failure for dorsal spinal instrumentations in this experimental setting...|$|E
40|$|Many {{rehabilitation}} robots use {{electric motors}} with gears. The backdrivability of geared drives is poor due to friction.

40|$|Abstract: Objectives: Surgical {{treatment}} of proximal humerus fractures {{can be challenging}} due to osteoporosis. The weak bone stock makes stable implant anchorage difficult, which can result in low primary stability. Accordingly, significant failure rates, even with modern locking plates, are reported in the literature. Intraoperative knowledge of local bone quality could be helpful in improving results. This study evaluates the feasibility of local bone quality quantification using <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque</b> measurements. Materials and Methods: A torque measurement tool (DensiProbe™) was developed to determine local resistance to breakaway offered by the cancellous bone in the humeral head to quantify local bone quality. The tool was adapted to a standard locking plate (PHILOS, Synthes), allowing measurement in {{the positions of the}} six humeral head screws, as provided by the aiming device of the plate. Two hundred and seventy measurements were performed in 44 fresh cadaveric human humeri. Results: Handling of the tool was straight forward and provided reproducible results for the six different positions. The method allows discrimination between the respective positions with statistical significance, and thus provides reliable information on the local distribution of bone quality within the humeral head. Discussion: This study introduces a new method using <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque</b> to determine local bone quality within the humeral head in real time. Because DensiProbe is adapted to a standard locking plate, there is the potential for intraoperative application.

This is a motor starting method for high inertia loads using a low voltage drive with input and output transformers to control motor torque and limit current when starting a medium/high voltage motor. The HTLC is a solution to motor starting problems where Direct on Line (DOL) or “Across the Line” starting is not feasible due to high in-rush current causing problems on the distribution system or where a reduced voltage starter cannot provide enough torque to achieve breakaway and accelerate the motor to full speed.

Vespel elements in bolts did not meet all our SRB requirements for reuse, however, we have defined a design for Vespel elements in nuts/anchor nuts that fully meets all requirements.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the efficiency of desired work inside the long tunnel drilling, rating of electrical drives at tunnel face has significantly increased. Due to the high rating concentration of electrical drives at tunnel face significant voltage must be required which is need of an hour to finish the work in given time interval and to avoid the various dangers. Therefore, planning of electrical power distribution is required and voltage drop across each electrical drives must be taken into account. While power planning drill machine, Armored Face Conveyors (AFC), Shearer, breaker, Stage loader, face lightning, etc. must be given due importance as starting power required to them is very high. <b>Breakaway</b> <b>torque</b> of the AFC is not maintained because of low power, so it is required to start constantly requiring high power as well as it will heat the environment, which is often hazardous.

Even though the voltage drop cannot be maintained in such cases boosting transformer with the power thyristor with tap changing is used to control the power instead of tap changer mechanism.

A device for intraoperative measure-ment of local bone quality has been developed by the AO-Research Foundation (Densi-Probe®). We used this device to experimental-ly measure peak <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque</b> of trabecu-lar bone in the proximal femur and correlated this with local bone mineral density (BMD) and failure load. Bone mineral density of 160 cadaver femurs was measured by ex situ dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The failure load of all femurs was analyzed by side-impact analysis. Femur fractures were fixed and mechanical peak torque was measured with the DensiProbe ® device. Correlation was cal-culated whereas correlation coefficient and significance was calculated by Fisher’s Z-transformation. Moreover, linear regression analysis was carried out. The unpaired Student’s t-test {{was used to assess}} the signifi-cance of differences. The Ward triangle region had the lowest BMD with 0. 511 g/cm 2 (± 0. 17 g/cm 2), followed by the upper neck region with 0. 546 g/cm 2 (± 0. 16 g/cm 2), trochanteric region with 0. 685 g/cm 2 (± 0. 19 g/cm 2) and the femoral neck with 0. 813 g/cm 2 (± 0. 2 g/cm 2). Peak torque of DensiProbe ® in the femoral head was 3. 48 Nm (± 2. 34 Nm). Load to failure was 4050. 2 N (± 1586. 7 N). The highest correlation of peak torque measured by Densi Probe ® and load to failure was found in the femoral neck (r= 0. 64, P< 0. 001). The overall correlation of mechanical peak torque with T-score was r= 0. 60 (P< 0. 001). A correlation was found between mechanical peak torque, load to fail-ure of bone and BMD in vitro. Trabecular strength of bone and bone mineral density are different aspects of bone strength, but a corre-lation was found between them.

40|$|The master {{thesis is}} a further {{investigation}} of the start-up procedure of a permanent magnet synchronous motor operated by variable frequency drive without position feedback via a long cable and transformers; as proposed in the specialization project, fall of 2013. The challenge is how to avoid large saturation in the transformers and motor while achieving the maximum possible starting torque with high cable resistance. In order to model and simulate the electrical system, the simulation software Simulink is used. A theoretical review is conducted {{in order to understand}} how to model system components, and how to start-up a permanent magnet synchronous motor while avoiding saturation in the transformer. Using the attained theoretical background, two permanent magnet synchronous motor Simulink models (with and without damper windings), an accurate pump load Simulink model, and three scalar control schemes which includes transmission system components for their control algorithms have been produced. In addition, a vector control scheme using field oriented control and extended Kalman filter for position estimation has been evaluated. A study case comprising of a permanent magnet synchronous motor operated by a variable frequency drive without position feedback via a long cable and transformers has been defined. The purpose of the study case is to study the defined control schemes, the permanent magnet synchronous motor's start-up procedure, and the electrical system's steady state behaviour. This include investigation of input parameter effects on the start-up procedure. The simulation results using the implemented pump load Simulink model shows that accurate load modelling affects the start-up procedure, as additional torque is required due to more rotational friction components. The simulation results of the study case show that the three proposed scalar control methods all are able to start-up the motor successfully, regardless of the initial rotor position. However, stability is not guaranteed at certain speed ranges due to the rise of small system disturbances. It has been shown that stability all through out the entire applied frequency range can be guaranteed by adding damping to the system. This is can be done by either adding transmission system components, motor damper windings, or a stabilization loop via frequency modulation. has been shown that cable length and applied frequency determines the accuracy of the transmission system voltage drop compensation algorithms of the proposed scalar control schemes. Increase in applied frequency and cable length increases the inaccuracy of the voltage drop compensation algorithms due to the ignored cable capacitance. Assuming that the maximum allowed voltage deviation from the required motor voltage during steady state is 0. 1 pu, the longest cable length that can be used with the proposed scalar control schemes is 40 km. An exception is the open-loop scalar control scheme using constant voltage boosting, which can be used for cable lengths up to 20 km, due to its inaccurate calculation assumptions. Additionally, {{it has been shown that}} the <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque</b> and the reference frequency ramp slope used by the controllers directly affect the torque oscillations during start-up. Additional torque oscillations can be experienced if the <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque</b> is too high or if the reference frequency ramp slope is too low due to the lack of torque build up, which consequently makes the start-up time higher. The vector controller gave the best performance during load step tests due to its precise control of the rotor field. However, due to the requirement of rotor position feedback, position estimation is required. The investigated position estimation technique, extended Kalman filter is able to estimated speed and position with very little error. However, the initial rotor position is required by the extended Kalman filter algorithm in order to predict states properly. Simulation results show that the vector control scheme offers the lowest possible start time due to its high performance. However, due to the requirement of initial rotor position of the sensorless vector controller, it can not be used during start-up, due to inaccuracies of predicting rotor position at zero speed. This leaves either the partial and delayed open-loop scalar control scheme or the closed-loop scalar control scheme to be the most viable start-up control schemes; as both control schemes offer comparably low start-up times, start-up currents and voltage boosting; which will consequently affect the dimensioning of the transformer. The vector controller can then be implemented after the start-up procedure using the selected scalar control scheme, in order to obtain the optimal controller performance. </p...|$|E

Author {{corporate}} affiliation: Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus, Ohio""February 2000. "Final report. July 27 - 29, 1998 This report {{documents the}} results of a series of tests in which several different types of performance-based brake testers (PBBTs) were compared side-by-side (i. e. a round robin test) in their ability to accurately measure brake forces (BFs) and wheel loads (WLs) of commercial vehicles (CVs), and to then predict the vehicle deceleration capability for a 32. 2 km/hr on-road stopping test. The PBBTs consisted of five roller dynamometers (RD), two flat plate (FP) testers, and one <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque</b> tester (BTT). A PBBT that can also meet a set of functional specifications could be used for law enforcement by safety inspectors once performance-based criteria are codified. In the test program, specific ratios of BF to WL were imposed on both a 5 -axle combination tractor semi-trailer and a two-axle straight truck, in both the fully laden and unladen conditions. In each loading condition, the overall vehicle braking capability was set to achieve a proposed minimum requirement of 0. 4 g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. In addition, the brakes on specific individual wheels were set to provide a BF/WL of 0. 25 and 0. 35, for a steer and a non-steer wheel, respectively. The vehicles were also instrumented to record stopping distances and decelerations from on-road stopping tests performed from 32. 2 km/hr. In general, nearly all of the PBBTs were able to accurately measure the CVs' brake forces. Only one of the FP-type testers experienced erratic performance during the round robin. In contrast several of the PBBTs had difficulty in reporting the accurate gross vehicle weight. In some cases, particularly with the portable PBBTs the reported wheel loads for axles 2 and 4 (the lead axle on the tandem set) of the 5 -axle vehicle were very high, leading to an under-prediction of the vehicle deceleration capability. Calibration checks of the PBBT weighing mechanisms indicated that all could meet the functional specifications. As such, it was concluded that accounting for the redistribution of axle loads due to the vehicle suspension and the geometry of the PBBT ramp would require special test procedures or remote entry of vehicle or axle weights for use in law enforcement.

40|$|Phase I: The use of {{adhesive}} locking features or liquid locking compounds (LLCs) (e. g., Loctite) as a {{means of}} providing a secondary locking feature has been used on NASA programs since the Apollo program. In many cases Loctite was used as a last resort when (a) self-locking fasteners were no longer functioning per their respective drawing specification, (b) access was limited for removal & replacement, or (c) replacement could not be accomplished without severe impact to schedule. Long-term use of Loctite became inevitable in cases where removal and replacement of worn hardware was not cost effective and Loctite was assumed to be fully cured and working. The NASA Engineering & Safety Center (NESC) and United Space Alliance (USA) recognized the need for more extensive testing of Loctite grades to better understand their capabilities and limitations as a secondary locking feature. These tests, identified as Phase I, were designed to identify processing sensitivities, to determine proper cure time, the correct primer to use on aerospace nutplate, insert and bolt materials such as A 286 and MP 35 N, and the minimum amount of Loctite that is required to achieve optimum <b>breakaway</b> <b>torque</b> values. The. 1900 - 32 was the fastener size tested, due to wide usage in the aerospace industry. Three different grades of Loctite were tested. Results indicate that, with proper controls, adhesive locking features can be successfully used in the repair of locking features and should be considered for design. Phase II: Threaded fastening systems used in aerospace programs typically have a requirement for a redundant locking feature. The primary locking method is the fastener preload and the traditional redundant locking feature is a self-locking mechanical device that may include deformed threads, non-metallic inserts, split beam features, or other methods that impede movement between threaded members. The self-locking resistance of traditional locking features can be directly verified during assembly by measuring the dynamic prevailing torque. Adhesive locking features or LLCs are another method of providing redundant locking, but a direct verification method has not been used in aerospace applications to verify proper installation when using LLCs because of concern for damage to the adhesive bond. The reliability of LLCs has also been questioned due to failures observed during testing with coupons for process verification, although the coupon failures have often been attributed to a lack of proper procedures. It is highly desirable to have a direct method of verifying the LLC cure or bond integrity. The purpose of the Phase II test program was to determine if the torque applied during direct verification of an adhesive locking feature degrades that locking feature. This report documents the test program used to investigate the viability of such a direct verification method. Results of the Phase II testing were positive, and additional investigation of direct verification of adhesive locking features is merited...|$|E
