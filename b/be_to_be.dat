The sample is used to frame the song {{in the context of}} the singer's childhood. According to Michael Cragg from The Guardian, the snippets were used to question the singer's [...] "drive and desire that's got her to where she is today, and whether the struggle was entirely worth it". The song then transcends into a depiction of Beyoncé as a beauty pageant contest awaiting judgment in the lyrics, [...] "Mama said, 'You're a pretty girl, what's in your head, it doesn't matter.

The second verse of [...] "Pretty Hurts"—"Blonder hair, flat chest/ TV says bigger is better/ South Beach, sugar free/ Vogue says thinner is better"—serve as an analysis of female body image and society's obsession with physical perfection.|$|E

Prior to [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)", the audience has only been exposed to Meg's cynicism; the song finally reveals that Meg's cynicism is actually a reaction to her romantic side, uncovering the [...] "misunderstood nature" [...] of the character. [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] reveals that the Meg has fallen in love too fast before, and explains that she is afraid of repeating the same mistake once more with Hercules. Despite her best efforts, the character realizes that she has in fact begun to develop feelings for Hercules much to her chagrin, but at first refuses to admit this; the song allows Meg to [...] "work through her denial", by [...] "alternating between fantasizing about how delightful it would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loved by Herc, and stomping her foot in anger at the very thought." [...] Resembling an [...] "admonishing" [...] exchange between Meg and the Muses, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] is Meg's attempt to avoid the clichéd storylines of her predecessors. Finally, after strolling a Greek courtyard while performing the song accompanied by the Muses who insist she is in denial, the character's resistance eventually proves futile and she ultimately relents. According to Taylor Weatherby of Billboard, the character [...] "finally comes to a conclusion to which many a girl (or guy) can relate". Tracy Dye of Bustle described the scene: [...] "Joined by The Muses, Meg attempts to vehemently deny her amour for Hercules". Writing for film critic Eric D. Snider's website, Kimber Kay joked that Meg [...] "tries her best to give a top 40 rendition of her solo song, but it gets stolen by the magnificent Muses." [...] Additionally, the musical number predicts that one of Hercules' most difficult challenges will be trying to change Meg's opinion of him. Writing for The Daily Dot, Aja Romano cited the song as Meg's [...] "I Want" [...] song.|$|E
