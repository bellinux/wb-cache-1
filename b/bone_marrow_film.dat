40|$|Acute leukaemia is a {{neoplastic}} {{disorder of}} haematopoietic precursors {{characterized by a}} rapid clinical course and a relatively high early death rate in spite of recent therapeutic progress. Prompt and reliable diagnostic and prognostic assessment has a favourable impact on patient outcome. Diagnostic suspicion relies on {{signs and symptoms of}} bone marrow failure or quali-/quantitative abnormalities of blood cells, which are accurately detected by modern automated counters. Cytomorphological examination of a stained blood and <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>film</b> {{plays a key role in}} the diagnostic process, with relevant additional information coming from immunophenotyping of blast cells. Cytogenetic and molecular genetic data are the basis of prognostic stratification. In this context, a coordinated intervention of specialized laboratories combining solid expertise in each field involved in the diagnostic work-up is essential; at the same time, the availability of all the required technologies at the same hospital structure would probably lack efficiency due to the low number of tests performed. The organization of laboratory networks, either at regional or national level, especially in the context of clinical trials, may offer a great opportunity for centralization of more sophisticated technologies in reference laboratories, each highly specialized in a particular field of investigation and all interconnected. The challenge for laboratory haematology is the reorganization of clinical and scientific activity according to this model, without loosing educational potential in favour of new generations of medical doctors, haematologists, biologists and laboratory technicians...|$|E

40|$|The {{criteria}} for the admission of patients to the Medical Research Council's (MRC) myeloma trials are the finding of abnormal plasma cells in <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>films</b> or sections and in addition either of characteristic skeletal lesions demonstrated radio-logically or of characteristic protein changes in the serum or urine. Ninety per cent of the patients in the first myeloma trial satisfied all three criteria (Medical Research Council, 1971). Before the introduction of alkylating agents {{in the treatment of}} myelomatosis the median survival of patients with this disease was 17 months after the onset of symptoms and seven months after the start of treatment (Farhangi and Osserman, 1973). The survival of patients is now much longer and this is due partly to the introduction of alkylating agents such as melphalan and cyclophosphamide and partly to improved techniques of biochemical monitoring of the tumour. The subject of this article is the monitoring of immunocytomas by biochemical analyses. The Detection of Paraproteins Plasma cells in the marrow and lymphoid tissue normally make complete immunoglobulins. The two heavy polypeptide chains are synthesized on large polyribosomes in {{about two and a half}} minutes, and the two light polypeptide chains are synthesized on smaller polyribosomes in about one minute (Askonas and Williamson, 1967). The four poly-peptide chains are then assembled and carbohydrate is added in the Golgi apparatus. The production of heavy and light chains is well balanced, there being normally a very small excess of light chains syn-thesized. About 2 to 3 mg of polyclonal free light chain is excreted into the urine per day. Differing chemical properties of the heavy chains allow immunoglobulins to be divided into distinc...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Adequate {{dosimetry}} {{is mandatory}} for effective and safe peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). Besides the kidneys, the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> is a potentially dose-limiting organ. The radiation dose to the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> is usually calculated {{according to the}} MIRD scheme, where the accumulated activity in the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> is calculated from the accumulated radioactivity of the radiopharmaceutical in the blood. This may underestimate the absorbed dose since stem cells express somatostatin receptors. We verified the blood-based method by comparing the activity in the blood with the radioactivity in <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> aspirates. Also, we evaluated the absorbed cross-dose from the source organs (liver, spleen, kidneys and blood), tumours and the so-called "remainder of the body" to the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow.</b> Methods: <b>Bone</b> <b>marrow</b> aspirates were drawn in 15 patients after treatment with [177 Lu-DOTA 0,Tyr 3]octreotate. Radioactivity in the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> was compared with radioactivity in the blood drawn simultaneously. The nucleated cell fraction was isolated from the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> aspirate and radioactivity was measured. The absorbed dose to the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> was calculated. The results were correlated to the change in platelet counts 6 weeks after treatment. Results: A strong linear correlation and high agreement between the measured radioactivities in the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> aspirates and in the blood was found (r= 0. 914, p< 0. 001). No correlation between the calculated absorbed dose in the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> and the change in platelets was found.

A population of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> cells of the phenotype HNK- 1 dollarlcub+rcubdollar (human natural killer cell antigen, CD 57), SSEA- 1 dollarlcub+rcubdollar (stage specific embryonic antigen) and OKM 1 dollarlcub+rcubdollar (human monocyte antigen, CD 11 B) was found to be highly suppressive for primary antibody responses. Conversely, a lymphocyte enriched <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> cells fraction could enhance the same antibody response. Neither population expressed surface markers for mature T nor B cells. Noteworthy was the finding that <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> depleted of natural suppressor cells was capable of mounting a primary antibody response. In addition, the two <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> cell populations acted antagonistically in the regulation of IgM antibody responses.;Both activities are mediated by soluble factors. <b>Bone</b> <b>marrow</b> Derived Suppressor Factor (BDSF) is a phospholipid that is synthesized de novo by HNK- 1 dollarlcub+rcubdollar <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> cells during a 24 hour culture.

Previous reports indi cate {{the incidence of}} <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> necrosis ranges from 0. 5 percent (rare) to approximately one-third of all <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> biopsies examined. Our studies indicate {{that the presence of}} <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> necrosis depends on the clinical condition of the patient. Overall, our incidence of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> necrosis was 37 percent of the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> biopsies examined. Of these, 26. 4 percent was mild. 7. 5 percent m oderate, and 3. 1 percent severe necrosis. The mechanism in most cases had an identifiable underlying eti ology such as a malignancy, or vascular or cytotoxic damage, with a small percentage being unexplained. <b>Bone</b> <b>marrow</b> necrosis is seen across a wide range of conditions, includ ing sickle cell diseases, AIDS, leukemia, lymphoma, m etastatic carci noma, anemia, sepsis, and o ther systemic diseases. Patients at the extremes of age, less than 20 years and greater than 70 years, usually demonstrate only small foci of necrosis (Grade I). Moderate (Grade II) and severe (Grade III) <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> necrosis are often associated with life threatening illnesses, with most of these being hematologic malignancies or <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> metastases. The prognosis associated with <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> necrosis seems to be dependent on the underlying primary clinical condi tion regardless of the degree of necrosis observed...|$|R
40|$|By {{observing the}} <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> {{obtained}} from the femur of rabbits with kollargol-induced anemia in bone-marrow tissue culture by cover-slip method, the following results were obtained. 1) When kollargol is added to normal <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> in culture, kollargol acts directly on the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> and inhibits its tissue growth. 2) The <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> which has become hyperplastic the tissue growth has been found better than control; the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> in which parenchymal cells have decreased in number does not necessarily show {{a decline in the}} tissue growth or in the cell function; and the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> in which parenchymal cells have markedly decreased show a marked fall both in the tissue growth and in the cell function. 3) The following may be assumed from the foregoing: Although kollargol acts directly on <b>bone</b> <b>marrow,</b> thus inhibiting the tissue growth, in the continuous injections it promotes the tissue growth of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> at first, and later inhibiting it, gradually decreases the number of parenchymal cells; and finally presents the tissue-culture picture similar to that of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> which is completely damaged. 4) However, because the number of fat cells are decreased in tissue culture of the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> which is completely damaged, tissue-culture of such <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> presents a picture differing from that observed in human hypoplastic anemia...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: <b>Bone</b> <b>marrow</b> can undergo {{necrosis}} {{for many}} different causes; malignant causes {{are reported to}} be more frequent. Methods: We undertook a 10 -year retrospective review of all <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> biopsy specimens with <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> necrosis at our institution. Results: Identified cases represented approximately 0. 3 % of our <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> cases. Most identified <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> cases with necrosis were involved by metastatic tumor or hematolymphoid malignancy (90 % of total) in relatively equal proportions. In those cases of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> necrosis with hematolymphoid malignancy, lymphoid disease predominated and the necrosis was often seen {{in the setting of}} chemotherapy.
