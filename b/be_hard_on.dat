500|$|There {{are several}} {{slightly}} varying accounts {{of why the}} bill for the three-cent nickel passed. Breen told of the pressure advocates for nickel put on House Coinage Committee chairman John Adam Kasson, finally winning {{him over to the}} position that even 25% nickel coins (which would <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the Mint's equipment) would be better than the continued use of shinplasters, and presenting him with a draft of a bill for a three-cent piece of that alloy. The bill made the new coin legal tender to sixty cents. [...] The 1864 act had made the cent legal tender to ten cents, and the two-cent piece to twenty; both limits were reduced to four cents. [...] The bill did not abolish the three-cent silver piece, which was still being struck in small quantities. The new copper-nickel coins would be issued in exchange for three-cent shinplasters—the Currency Bureau was instructed to print no more three-cent notes.|$|E
500|$|Lin {{acknowledged}} the expectations and warned, [...] "I won't be an All-Star this year." [...] He was {{appreciative of the}} support, especially from the Asian-American community, but he preferred to concentrate on his play without all the attention when he had not [...] "proven anything to anybody". Smart saw that Lin was skilled at getting to the paint, but needed to learn to pass because, he said, Lin [...] "couldn't shoot the ball at all". The coach also noticed that Lin always arrived early for practice and left late. Lin studied and rehearsed Steve Nash's and other top point guards' pick-and-roll plays. Frank Hughes of Sports Illustrated wrote that Lin spoke with the occasional [...] "seeds of self-doubt", which he said was uncommon to hear in the NBA. Hughes also found it rare when Lin compared himself to the Phoenix Suns' then-backup point guard Goran Dragić. [...] "Neither of us is a freak athlete, but we're both effective {{and know how to}} play the game," [...] Lin said. Lin and Stephen Curry, the 2009–10 runner-up Rookie of the Year, received more interview requests than any other Warrior. Team officials regularly denied requests for Lin to help him keep his focus. He was approached to be the subject of documentaries. Smart planned to take pressure off Lin since Lin had a tendency to <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> himself and get frustrated, but the coach admitted that he once succumbed to the home crowd's wishes and put Lin into a game in the wrong situation.|$|E

2500|$|A high-pass (low-cut) and/or {{low-pass}} (high-cut) filter {{may also}} be included on equalizers or audio consoles. High-pass (low-cut) and low-pass (high-cut) filters restrict a given channel's bandwidth extremes. Cutting very low frequency sound signals (termed infrasonic, or subsonic, a misnomer) reduces the waste of amplifier power which does not produce audible sound and which moreover can <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the low-range speakers. A low-pass filter to cut ultrasonic energy is useful to prevent interference from radio frequencies, lighting control hum, or digital circuitry creeping into the power amplifiers. Such filters are often included with graphic and parametric equalizers to give the audio engineer full control of the frequency range. [...] If their response is steep enough, high-pass filters and low-pass filters function as end-cut filters. [...] A feedback suppressor is an automatically-adjusted band-reject or notch filter which includes a microprocessor to detect the onset of [...] feedback [...] "howls" [...] and direct the filter to suppress the feedback by lowering the gain right at the offending frequency.|$|E
2500|$|Smailey {{says he has}} {{no desire}} to <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> her, but that [...] "it is a fraud". Ruth points out he was guilty of fraud, and she has {{evidence}} to prove it. Smailey tries to buy it from her, but she's respectable now: She won't take his money, though she keeps the papers as she [...] "ain't a fool"; Smailey leaves. Fitz-Partington interviews Ruth, to her confusion. Mrs. Van Brugh re-enters, and Fitz-Partington warns her about Smailey, explaining that his detective agency was called on to find out about Smailey's fraud, but as Smailey then hired him to investigate Mrs. Van Brugh, they had combined the cases. However, Fitz-Partington goes on to ask several further questions about Mrs. Van Brugh's marriage, and she begins to realise what Smailey is looking for: if Mrs. Van Brugh's godfather had called her Captain Van Brugh's wife in his will, her secret might be revealed. Smailey returns with the will, and reads out the relevant section about the farm, ending with the section referring to her as [...] "Catherine Ellen, wife of Captain Richard Van Brugh." [...] She faints into a chair.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{have also}} {{commented on the}} voice acting for Madeline {{and its impact on}} the player. In Blasko's opinion, Madeline's {{constant}} giggling, pirouetting, skipping, and smiling reflected the programmers' awareness of the games' intended, female audience. [...] Writers in two SuperKids reviews found Madeline's accent and [...] "encouraging, praising, and giggling" [...] attitude to be endearing, but Hwan-Chi questioned if she would deter a male audience. AllGames Lisa Karen Savignano compared the repeated phrases used by Madeline to congratulate the player to [...] "fingernails down a blackboard" [...] and advised [...] "invest in a good pair of earplugs" [...] before playing the game. Foran wrote that players may get annoyed by Madeline's [...] "phony accent and endless saccharine praise", and Lynne Touhy from The Daily Gazette called the repetition of the [...] "You are so clever" [...] sentiment in Madeline's [...] "French-accentuated, high-pitched" [...] voice to be a deterrent to the player. Ray praised the characterization of Madeline, but found that her faux French accent proved annoying to his kid play-testers. Jeffrey Branzburg wrote in Technology & Learning that young players may have difficulty understanding her French accent, while Macworld suggested her [...] "exaggerated French accent can <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the ears [...] annoying". Meanwhile, New Straits Times Rhonwyn Hwan-Chi thought Madeline spoke [...] "flawless (although accented) English." [...] The Herald Sun wrote that she speaks [...] "in the worst fake French accent imaginable." [...] Home PC suggested that Christopher Plummer's narration [...] "frees children who have not yet learned to read from the feelings of frustration that come with stumbling through printed directions." ...|$|E
