25|$|Inslaw's initial filing {{claimed that}} the {{contract}} disputes arose because the DOJ officials who administered the contract were biased against Inslaw. The filing specifically mentioned Promis project manager, C. Madison Brewer, and Associate Attorney General, D. Lowell Jensen. Brewer had previously been Inslaw's general counsel, but according to Inslaw had been terminated for cause. Inslaw claimed that Brewer's dismissal caused him to be unreasonably biased against Inslaw and owner William Hamilton. Jensen {{was a member of}} the project oversight committee at the time of the contract. He had helped to develop another competing case management software system several years earlier, and Inslaw claimed that this led him to <b>be</b> <b>prejudiced</b> against Promis, so that he ignored the unreasonable bias of Brewer.|$|E
500|$|In his {{literary}} reviews, Fielding often wrote with a biased hand. For instance, he gave immoderate praise to Charlotte Lennox's The Female Quixote and Charles Macklin's two-act comic play The Covent Garden Theatre, or Paquin Turn'd Drawcansir; Lennox and Macklin were long-time friends of Fielding, and Macklin's play {{was based on}} Fielding's life. Fielding had a noted tendency to <b>be</b> <b>prejudiced</b> toward certain authors too – Rabelais and Aristophanes were always met harshly, while Jonathan Swift, Cervantes, and Lucian were praised as a [...] "great Triumvirate". Samuel Richardson's Clarissa – published in 1748 {{and one of the}} longest novels in the English language – is a noted exception: it was received well, even though Fielding considered Richardson a literary rival, and despite Richardson's calling the periodical [...] "The Common Garden Journal". Fielding lauded the work of friend William Hogarth and poetry by Edward Young. He also promoted plays involving David Garrick and James Lacy (among others).|$|E
500|$|When {{beginning}} the game, the player {{may choose to}} play a pre-selected party, or to create a party of up to six characters; unlike the Baldur's Gate series, Icewind Dale II does not permit the player to import characters from previous Icewind Dale games. While creating characters, the player chooses their gender, race, class, alignment, and attributes, among other things. The player can sometimes choose a subvariety of a race or class, such as Deep Gnome or Cleric of Ilmater. Race, alignment, and attributes affect the player character's available dialogue options, as well as NPC responses. For example, some NPCs will <b>be</b> <b>prejudiced</b> against certain races, or a character of low intelligence will have limited dialogue options. Some sub-races in the game are significantly {{more powerful than the}} core races present in AD Third Edition; these sub-races must earn more experience points than others before leveling up. Characters can reach a maximum level of thirty. [...] It is possible to add additional characters to the party at any time, including during combat.|$|E

She was quite a selfish woman [...]" [...] Dot has been described by author Hilary Kingsley as a [...] "born victim." [...] She adds that [...] "with each blow that life delivers [...] bobs back up again, almost asking for more trouble, more pain, more suffering." [...] Dot is renowned for being a hypochondriac, her Christian faith and quoting from the Bible. She has been described by Rupert Smith, author of 20 Years in Albert Square, as [...] "God-bothering" [...] and self-righteous. According to Kingsley, [...] "nothing shakes Dot's view that the world is good because the creator made it so. Her faith sustains her through the most appalling ordeals." [...] The character once expressed {{part of the reason for}} her faith on-screen in 2000, commenting to a vicar, [...] "I couldn't manage without my faith, not with the life I've had"; former executive producer of EastEnders, John Yorke, has stated that this is his favourite line of EastEnders' entire existence. Author Antony Slide has noted that Dot's religious beliefs have given her solace, but has given her an excuse to <b>be</b> <b>prejudiced</b> against her neighbours, and to deal with the criminal antics of her wayward son. He described her as a [...] "simpleminded woman whom one loved to hate".|$|E

2500|$|Also, {{the term}} is often used in {{relation}} to what is seen as prejudice within a minority or subjugated group, as {{in the concept of}} [...] "reverse racism". Reverse racism describes discriminatory actions by members of a minority group against a dominant or formerly dominant racial or other group representative of the majority in a particular society. Those who campaign for the interests of ethnic minorities commonly reject the term [...] "reverse racism". From their perspective, [...] "racism" [...] is defined {{not only in terms of}} individual prejudice, but also in terms of a power structure which protects the interests of the dominant culture and actively discriminates against ethnic minorities. From this perspective, they claim that while members of ethnic minorities may <b>be</b> <b>prejudiced</b> against members of the dominant culture, they lack the political and economic power to actively oppress them, and they are therefore incapable of [...] "racism".|$|E

In the same case are prosecuted Laurențiu Ciurel, director of Investment at Rovinari Energy Complex at the material time, and former general manager of Turceni Energy Complex, Dumitru Cristea, for abuse of office.
