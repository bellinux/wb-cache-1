25|$|Genetically {{modified}} (GM) cotton {{was developed}} to reduce the heavy reliance on pesticides. The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) naturally produces a chemical harmful only to {{a small fraction of}} insects, most notably the larvae of moths and butterflies, beetles, and flies, and harmless to other forms of life. The gene coding for Bt toxin has been inserted into cotton, causing cotton, called Bt cotton, to produce this natural insecticide in its tissues. In many regions, the main pests in commercial cotton are lepidopteran larvae, which are killed by the <b>Bt</b> <b>protein</b> in the transgenic cotton they eat. This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad-spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests (some of which have developed pyrethroid resistance). This spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology and further contributes to noninsecticide pest management.|$|E

40|$|Genes expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins {{have been}} {{incorporated}} into genetically modified (GM) plants to render these resistant to certain insect pests. Of particular interest have been the genes encoding Cry (Crystal) proteins, but also the gene encoding the vegetative insecticidal protein Vip 3 Aa has {{been incorporated into}} crop plants. Over the last decennium, GM events have been crossed through traditional breeding, resulting in stacked GM events expressing several Bt insect resistance genes. Experiments demonstrate that interactions between two or more toxins can either enhance or decrease their activity. It is thus possible that interactions between <b>Bt</b> <b>proteins</b> produced by GM plants occur and thereby influence their effect on non-target invertebrates compared to GM plants expressing just a single Bt gene. This report has been drafted {{as a response to}} a call of the Netherlands Commission of Genetic Modification (COGEM) to address two main questions: (1) can interactions between <b>Bt</b> <b>proteins</b> be predicted and (2) to what extent are studies on interactions relevant for risk/safety assessment of GM crops. The questions were tackled from an eco-toxicological angle, in particular taking into account those types of information that are relevant for risk/safety assessment of GM crops. Answering the questions was done by reviewing and considering the current knowledge on the specificity of <b>Bt</b> <b>proteins,</b> on known interactions between <b>Bt</b> <b>proteins</b> and the methods to assess these interactions, and available guidance for risk/safety assessment of GM crops combining multiple <b>Bt</b> <b>proteins.</b> Also the information reviewed in a parallel project addressing the same questions, but from a biochemical and toxicological perspective (Eco¿tat, 2014), was taken into account when formulating conclusions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Cotton Catchment Communities Cooperative Research Centre began {{during a}} period of rapid uptake of Bollgard II ® cotton, which {{contains}} genes to express two <b>Bt</b> <b>proteins</b> that control the primary pests of cotton in Australia, Helicoverpa armigera and H. punctigera. The dramatic uptake of this technology presumably resulted in strong selection pressure for resistance in Helicoverpa spp. against the <b>Bt</b> <b>proteins.</b> The discovery of higher than expected levels of resistance in both species against one of the proteins in Bollgard II ® cotton (Cry 2 Ab) led to significant re-evaluation of the resistance management plan developed for this technology, which was a core area of research for the Cotton CRC. The uptake of Bollgard II ® cotton also led to a substantial decline in pesticide applications againstHelicoverpa spp. (from 10 – 14 to 0 – 3 applications per season). The low spray environment allowed some pests not controlled by the <b>Bt</b> <b>proteins</b> to emerge as more significant pests, especially sucking species such as Creontiades dilutus and Nezara viridula. A range of other minor pests have also sporadically arisen as problems. Lack of knowledge and experience with these pests created uncertainty and encouraged insecticide use, which threatened to undermine the gains made with Bollgard II ® cotton. Here we chronicle the achievements of the Cotton CRC in providing the industry with new knowledge and management strategies for these pests...|$|R

30|$|<b>Bt</b> <b>proteins</b> in genetically {{modified}} crops may pose a risk to non-target beneficial arthropods providing biological control, pollination and decomposition services in the ecosystem. The possible lethal effects posed by insecticidal proteins in biological control agents can be determined under laboratory studies in different ways (Tian et al. 2013): (1) directly, the organism can {{be exposed to the}} protein incorporated in an artificial diet or mixed with non-genetically and {{genetically modified}} plant materials; and (2) indirectly, predatory species can be offered target or non-target prey herbivores fed on genetically modified plants. The latter way involving prey-mediated effects at higher trophic level provides a very realistic exposure pathway and has been experimented in numerous tri-trophic interaction studies with genetically modified Bt crops. Target prey herbivores susceptible to <b>Bt</b> <b>proteins</b> may result in prey quality-mediated effects at the third trophic level. One way to avoid this impact is to use non-target herbivores, which are not susceptible to proteins expressed in transgenic plants (Romeis et al. 2011).|$|R
30|$|By {{virtue of}} their altered {{environmental}} fate and risk profile, all systemic pesticides should be counted when measuring pesticide use, and hence so too should the <b>Bt</b> <b>proteins</b> manufactured in Bt- transgenic crops. If Bt-transgenic plants produced proteins that disrupted insect morphology, feeding behavior, or reproduction, {{the absence of a}} toxic mode of action would strengthen the argument that <b>Bt</b> Cry <b>proteins</b> are not functionally equivalent to insecticides, and hence should not be counted as insecticides applied. Bt-crop technology that limits Bt-endotoxin expression to only those tissues that are under active attack, and then only during times when insects are actively feeding, would also support the view that Bt crops are compatible with IPM.|$|R
30|$|It {{should also}} be noted that, in general, the {{systemic}} delivery of <b>Bt</b> Cry <b>proteins</b> poses more significant risks to animals and humans ingesting Bt crops than applications of Bt insecticides via liquid sprays.

50|$|Bt {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1901 by Japanese biologist S. Ishiwatari {{as the source}} of disease that was killing large populations of silkworms. Bt was first used as an insecticide in 1920 and spray formulations containing either Bt bacteria or Bt proteins came into use in the 1970s for crop protection, including organic farming operations. Bt insecticides saw expanded use and development in the 1980s as an alternative to synthetic insecticides. Beginning in the 1980s, the genes responsible for making Bt proteins were isolated and transferred into corn plants. Bt was commercially approved in transgenic corn seed in the mid-1990s. Compared to spray formulations, transgenic plants with the <b>Bt</b> <b>protein</b> provide much more effective insect protection throughout the season. Other Bt proteins have been used to genetically modify potatoes, cotton and other types of commercial corn. The two most common brands of transgenic Bt corn are Genuity and Herculex. Genuity Smartstax combines Monsanto's VT Triple Pro, Roundup Ready 2, and Acceleron Seed Treatment System technologies, as well as Dow Chemical's Herculex Xtra and Liberty Link technologies. Acceleron, Herculex Xtra, and VT Triple Pro include traits for protection from insect damage.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E.

In this study, it was {{evaluated}} the biological activity of <b>Bt</b> <b>proteins</b> expressed in different plant structures of YieldGard VT PRO(tm) and PowerCore(tm) corn against S. frugiperda. Complete mortality of S. frugiperda neonates was observed on leaf-disc of both Bt corn technologies. However, the mortality in silks and grains was lower than 50 and 6 %, respectively. In addition, more than 49 % of the surviving larvae in silks and grains completed the biological cycle. However, all life table parameters were negatively affected in insects that developed in silks and grains of both Bt corn events. In summary, the low biological activity of <b>Bt</b> <b>proteins</b> expressed on silks and grains of YieldGard VT PRO(tm) and PowerCore(tm) corn {{can contribute to the}} resistance evolution in S. frugiperda populations...|$|R
