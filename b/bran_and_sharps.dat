50|$|Historically, brown {{meal was}} what {{remained}} after about 90% of the coarse, outer <b>bran</b> <b>and</b> 74% of pure endosperm or fine flour {{was removed from}} the whole grain. Using slightly different extraction numbers, brown meal, representing 20% of the whole grain, was itself composed of about 15% fine <b>bran</b> <b>and</b> 85% white flour. In 1848 it was asserted grain millers knew only of <b>bran</b> <b>and</b> endosperm, but by 1912 it was more widely known that brown meal included the germ.|$|R

50|$|As the {{nutritional}} value of vitamins, micronutrients, antioxidants, phytonutrients, amino acids, and fiber, were completely or relatively {{unknown in the}} late 19th century, removing the <b>bran</b> <b>and</b> the germ with the roller mill, invented at that time, was an attractive idea. With {{the elimination of the}} <b>bran</b> <b>and</b> the germ, the resulting “white” flour composed entirely of the endosperm produced an appealing product that research has since proven to be nutritionally deficient: The endosperm contains {{less than half of the}} total minerals and B-vitamins of the wheat kernel. Perhaps as significantly is the lost total food value since the <b>bran</b> <b>and</b> germ represent 17% of the whole grain, and the process of eliminating the <b>bran</b> <b>and</b> shorts in the roller mill typically yields only 70 to 75% of grain weight as flour product, thus significantly reducing the human food supply as well.|$|R

40|$|MIXED grain rations {{including}} wheat, oat {{and corn}} products have been {{popular in the}} Mid-West for some time.
