25|$|Starting in 1962, Lange began {{promoting}} South Africa and Rhodesia in his paper. One of {{his main}} motivations was {{fears that the}} countries would turn communist, and he was critical of what he {{considered to be a}} one-sided and biased presentation of the conditions in the countries. He also had several Norwegian friends in South Africa who traded and did business in the country, and who also considered information about the country in Norway to <b>be</b> <b>naïve</b> and one-sided. Lange said that he received his information about the countries from numerous Norwegian, American and African magazines.|$|E
25|$|That said, in {{previous}} elections, approximate forecasting of results were achieved by {{assuming that the}} swing in each individual constituency {{will be the same}} across the country. This system, known as uniform national swing (UNS) is used by much of the media in Britain to assess and extrapolate electoral fortunes from opinion poll data, though there has been criticism that such predictions may <b>be</b> <b>naive</b> and unreliable, even from providers of such data. By using UNS projections, several media commentators and politicians have suggested that significant swings towards the Liberal Democrats in the opinion polls may not necessarily amount to significant gains in terms of parliamentary seats, including predictions that even if the Liberal Democrats had the most votes, and Labour the least, it could be the case that Labour retains the most seats while the Lib Dems have the fewest.|$|E
25|$|Candidate Reviews: Despite {{her having}} the weakest {{track record of}} the final four and her unwillingness to admit ever being wrong about anything, the interviewers {{unanimously}} considered Saira {{to be the most}} impressive of the candidates, giving her much praise for her prior accomplishments and salesmanship, and even feeling that her abrasiveness could be a strength in the right circumstances. The interviewers noted that while James was, on paper, the strongest of the four candidates, they found him unconvincing in the interviews and questioned whether his heart was in the process. Meanwhile, Tim was commended for his passion, determination and business knowledge, but the interviewers considered him to <b>be</b> <b>naive</b> and were concerned that stepping up to run one of Sir Alan's businesses would be a step too far, while Paul was deemed the weakest of the candidates, mostly due to his short temper and background in businesses that had very little relation to anything Sir Alan did.|$|E

500|$|Disputing these analyses, David Brin {{states that}} while an {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may have an}} imperative to act for no benefit to itself, it would <b>be</b> <b>naïve</b> to suggest that such a trait would be prevalent throughout the galaxy. Brin points {{to the fact that}} in many moral systems on Earth, such as the Aztec or Carthaginian one, non-military killing has been accepted and even [...] "exalted" [...] by society, and further mentions that such acts are not confined to humans but can be found throughout the animal kingdom.|$|E
500|$|The hunter-gatherers made most of {{the iconic}} {{engravings}} and probably all the paintings. The carvings represent animals such as rhinoceroses, elephants, ostriches and giraffes as well as depictions of human and animal footprints. Some of the figures, most prominently the [...] "Lion Man"—a lion with an extremely long rectangular kinked tail ending in a six-toed pugmark— depict the transformation of humans into animals. This transformation and the depiction of animals together with their tracks make it likely that they were created as part of shamanist rituals. The more simplistic perception that they only show hunter-gatherers' attempts to acquire food is now thought to <b>be</b> <b>naïve.</b>|$|E
500|$|Generally, {{the party}} wants a stricter {{immigration}} policy, {{so that only}} {{those who are in}} need of protection according to the UN Refugee Convention are allowed to stay in Norway. In a speech in the 2007 election campaign, Siv Jensen claimed that the immigration policy was a failure because it let criminals stay in Norway, while throwing out people who worked hard and followed the law. The party claims the immigration and integration policy to <b>be</b> <b>naïve.</b> In 2009, the party proposed an official goal of reducing accepted asylum seekers by about 90%, from 1,000 to 100 a month, the standards then said to be used in Denmark and Finland, although less than 100 a year was proposed in 2008. In 2008, the party wanted to [...] "avoid illiterates and other poorly resourced groups who we see are not able to adapt in Norway"; which included countries as Somalia, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The party opposes that asylum seekers are allowed stay in Norway on humanitarian grounds or due to health issues, and seeks to substantially limit the number of family reunifications. The party has also called for a referendum on the general immigration policy.|$|E

500|$|The album's only cover song, [...] "California Sun", was {{originally}} written by Henry Glover and Morris Levy, and performed by The Rivieras. While the lyrics and musical structure {{remain the same}} throughout the piece, Joey's pronunciation upon words significantly lessened the similarity to the original song. The sound output tone also differs from the original, with more distortion {{as well as a}} faster tempo. Author Steve Waksman relates: [...] "From the opening bars, 'California Sun' becomes subject to the Ramones' distinctive brand of musical minimalism paired with sonic excess. The chords go by in a blur of distortion; the drums and bass kick at seemingly twice the speed of the Rivieras." [...] The twelfth track [...] "Commando" [...] has a theme which deals with war movies and contains multiple military references. Author Avram Mednick said the song was a successor to [...] "Blitzkrieg Bop", released on the band's debut album. He also noted that it has a [...] "bouncy melody and an infectious call-and-response chorus." [...] "You're Gonna Kill that Girl", which was written very early in the band's career, was also rooted in doo-wop genre. Mednick commented that it appealed highly to those tuning into the Ramones in the UK, and also said it has a [...] "lovely misogynistic tune." [...] The final guitar chord on the track is played by drummer Tommy since Johnny rarely played acoustic. The album's final track, [...] "You Should Never Have Opened That Door", was written by Dee Dee and Johnny, and circles themes of horror films and hints that people in these movies tend to <b>be</b> <b>naïve</b> and unintelligent.|$|E

2500|$|Hall {{finds that}} in the 1940s and 1950s English professors dropped Parrington's {{approach}} {{in favor of the}} [...] "New Criticism" [...] and focused on the texts themselves rather than the social, economic, and political contexts that intrigued Parrington. Meanwhile, historians shifted to a consensus model of the past that considered Parrington's dialectical polarity between liberal and conservative to <b>be</b> <b>naive.</b> [...] During the 1950s the book lost its popularity, and was largely ignored by scholars. [...] While dismissing its thesis, some commentators were still captivated by Parrington's politically committed writing style, as historian David W. Levy noted: ...|$|E
2500|$|Considered one of {{the most}} {{pronounced}} conservative Norwegian politicians in his time, he has in later years shifted his position in many areas. He has taken issue with the [...] "culture of greed", [...] "tax paradises', the environment [...] and has been particularly harsh in his condemnation of Israel's policies toward Palestinians, claiming that the occupation of and settlement on Palestinian land (outside the 1967 borders) is unlawful. Though widely respected for his activism and argumentative style, he has also received criticism from several commentators, for example for accusing the country of [...] "ethnic cleansing," [...] and for saying it is [...] "creating terror" [...] by cultivating extremism [...] "as if in a greenhouse in the Palestinian areas". [...] One of the critics, his long-time friend and party colleague Jo Benkow, commented that [...] "On this topic, Willoch must be the most partisan public person in this country.". Willoch has also stated that, though [...] "there are strong reasons to warn against the new antisemitism, it will not strengthen Israel's cause to accuse critics of Israeli politics of antisemitism". He also claims that Israel indirectly contributes to New antisemitism stating that [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>naïve</b> to ignore that Israel's politics towards the Palestinians has become a new source of negative attitudes." [...] In May 2006, Willoch invited Atef Adwan, an official in Hamas to a private luncheon at Det Norske Selskab, commenting that [...] "A dialogue with Hamas is very useful." [...] an action that prompted criticism by fellow Conservative party member and former foreign minister Jan Petersen.|$|E

2500|$|Pure Mule {{received}} a favourable {{reaction from the}} critics, with some praising it for being the first RTÉ drama of the decade to portray issues such as Alzheimer's disease though locals said it portrayed midlanders in a bad light. Tom Parlon, a TD, spoke of the upset Pure Mules themes of cocaine and other issues caused to [...] "a lot of people" [...] in his constituency of Laois–Offaly, saying: It does make for uncomfortable viewing especially for someone like me whose has lived all their life in rural Ireland. But let's not <b>be</b> <b>naive</b> here. I believe the programme has also performed a valuable service by highlighting in stark and uncomfortable terms the challenges facing rural Ireland today in particular increased drug use amongst our young population. [...] Pure Mule has shown to all who watch it that young people {{in every corner of}} this country are experimenting with and using drugs on a large scale. Teenage sex and sexual promiscuity are other uncomfortable issues that are dealt with. It is fiction but it has also struck a raw nerve because it is telling an unpalatable truth. As a rural TD and as a parent, I believe what we are facing is a ticking time bomb in rural Ireland, where our young people feel increasingly dislocated from their community, where a lack of recreational and social outlets is fuelling the increase in drink and drug use. The last 20 years has brought unprecedented economic growth and social change across Ireland. What we must now do is face up to the social challenges.|$|E
