25|$|Inspired by {{the success}} of Boltzmann {{machines}} based on classical <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>distribution,</b> a new machine learning approach based on quantum <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>distribution</b> of a transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian was recently proposed. Due to the non-commutative nature of quantum mechanics, the training process of the quantum Boltzmann machine can become nontrivial. This problem was, to some extent, circumvented by introducing bounds on the quantum probabilities, allowing the authors to train the model efficiently by sampling. It is possible that a specific type of quantum Boltzmann machine has been trained in the D-Wave 2X by using a learning rule analogous to that of classical Boltzmann machines.|$|E

25|$|A {{computationally}} hard problem, {{which is}} key for some relevant machine learning tasks, is {{the estimation of}} averages over probabilistic models {{defined in terms of}} a <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>distribution.</b> Sampling from generic probabilistic models is hard: algorithms relying heavily on sampling are expected to remain intractable no matter how large and powerful classical computing resources become.

25|$|Some {{research}} groups have recently explored {{the use of}} quantum annealing hardware for training Boltzmann machines and deep neural networks. The standard approach to training Boltzmann machines relies on the computation of certain averages that can be estimated by standard sampling techniques, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms.

40|$|Near a charged surface, counterions of {{different}} valences and sizes cluster; and their concentration profiles stratify. At {{a distance from}} such a surface larger than the Debye length, the electric field is screened by counterions. Recent studies by a variational mean-field approach that includes ionic size effects and by Monte Carlo simulations both suggest that the counterion stratification {{is determined by the}} ionic valence-to-volume ratios. Central in the mean-field approach is a free-energy functional of ionic concentrations in which the ionic size effects are included through the entropic effect of solvent molecules. The corresponding equilibrium conditions define the generalized <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>distributions</b> relating the ionic concentrations to the electrostatic potential. This paper presents a detailed analysis and numerical calculations of such a free-energy functional to understand the dependence of the ionic charge density on the electrostatic potential through the generalized <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>distributions,</b> the role of ionic valence-to-volume ratios in the counterion stratification, and the modification of Debye length due to the effect of ionic sizes. ...|$|R

25|$|A {{metal ion}} {{with a single}} {{unpaired}} electron, such as Cu2+, in a coordination complex provides the simplest illustration of the mechanism of paramagnetism. The individual metal ions are kept far apart by the ligands, {{so that there is}} no magnetic interaction between them. The system is said to be magnetically dilute. The magnetic dipoles of the atoms point in random directions. When a magnetic field is applied, first-order Zeeman splitting occurs. Atoms with spins aligned to the field slightly outnumber the atoms with non-aligned spins. In the first-order Zeeman effect the energy difference between the two states is proportional to the applied field strength. Denoting the energy difference as ΔE, the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>distribution</b> gives the ratio of the two populations as , where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature in kelvins. In most cases ΔE is much smaller than kT and the exponential can be expanded as 1 – ΔE/kT.

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} {{behavior}} of the excited electronic states of atoms in the relaxation zone of one-dimensional airflows obtained in shock-tube facilities. A collisional-radiative model is developed, accounting for thermal nonequilibrium between the translational energy mode of the gas and the vibrational energy mode of individual molecules. The electronic states of atoms are treated as separate species, allowing for non-Boltzmann distributions of their populations. Relaxation of the free-electron energy is also accounted for by using a separate conservation equation. We apply the model to three trajectory points of the Fire II flight experiment. In the rapidly ionizing regime behind strong shock waves, the electronic energy level populations depart from <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>distributions</b> because the highlying bound electronic states are depleted. To quantify the extent of this nonequilibrium effect, we compare the results obtained by means of the collisional-radiative model with those based on <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>distributions.</b> For the earliest trajectory point, we show that the quasi-steady-state assumption is only valid for the high-lying excited states and cannot be extended to the metastable states...|$|R
