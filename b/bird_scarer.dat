50|$|A <b>bird</b> <b>scarer</b> is any of {{a number}} devices {{designed}} to scare birds, usually employed by farmers to dissuade birds from eating recently planted arable crops.|$|E
5000|$|A klopotec (pronounced [...] ) is {{a wooden}} {{mechanical}} device {{on a high}} wooden pole, similar to a windmill. It {{is used as a}} <b>bird</b> <b>scarer</b> in the vineyards of traditional wine-growing landscapes of Slovenia, Austria, and Croatia. It is one of the symbols of Slovenia and Styria.|$|E
5000|$|If {{just being}} placed in situ and left, audible <b>bird</b> <b>scarers</b> can easily become {{ineffective}} bird control solutions, however when managed {{on an ongoing basis}} or used as part of a greater bird deterrent system, sound methods can deliver partial results for low level bird activity. Audible <b>bird</b> <b>scarers</b> are totally ineffective for nesting birds ...|$|R
50|$|Fireworks {{can also}} be used in an {{agricultural}} capacity as <b>bird</b> <b>scarers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Audible <b>bird</b> <b>scarers</b> use noise stimuli {{that makes}} birds uncomfortable. However, once birds realize these pose no real threats, {{they can easily}} become habituated to sounds that seemed {{initially}} frightening. If just being placed in situ and left, audible <b>bird</b> <b>scarers</b> can easily become ineffective bird control solutions, however when managed {{on an ongoing basis}} or used as part of a greater bird deterrent system, sound methods can deliver quality results.|$|R
50|$|The Helikite <b>bird</b> <b>scarer</b> is a lighter-than-air {{combination}} of a helium balloon and a kite. Helikites fly up to 200vft {{in the air with}} or without wind. Although they do not look like hawks, they fly and hover high in the sky behaving like birds of prey. Helikites successfully exploit bird pests' instinctive fear of hawks and can reliably protect large areas of farmland.|$|E
50|$|Joshua Shaw {{was born}} in Billinngborough, Lincolnshire, England in 1776 and was {{orphaned}} {{at the age of}} 7. To survive he worked for a local farmer as a <b>bird</b> <b>scarer.</b> During the three years he spent doing this work he discovered his artistic talent and began drawing the animals he encountered. After his mother remarried Shaw worked for his stepfather's plumbing and glazing business, and later as a mail carrier.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the oldest}} designs of <b>bird</b> <b>scarer</b> is the {{scarecrow}} {{in the shape of}} a human figure. The scarecrow idea has been built upon numerous times, and not all visual scare devices are shaped like humans. The [...] "Flashman Birdscarer," [...] Iridescent tape, [...] "TerrorEyes" [...] balloons, and other visual deterrents are all built on the idea of visually scaring birds. This method doesn't work so well with all species, considering that some species frequently perch on scarecrows.|$|E
5000|$|Fireworks {{can also}} be used as <b>bird</b> <b>scarers,</b> and some jurisdictions issue special {{licences}} for agricultural fireworks. [...] This practice has been criticised as a loophole for the sale of consumer fireworks. Again, the loud bangs can also irritate people living on nearby properties.|$|R
5|$|Seabird {{mortality}} {{caused by}} long-line fisheries can be greatly reduced by {{techniques such as}} setting long-line bait at night, dying the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, {{increasing the amount of}} weight on lines and by using <b>bird</b> <b>scarers,</b> and their deployment is increasingly required by many national fishing fleets. The international ban on the use of drift nets has also helped reduce the mortality of seabirds and other marine wildlife.|$|R
50|$|Consumer {{pyrotechnics}} are devices {{readily available}} for purchase {{to the general public}} with little or no special licensing or training. These items are considered relatively low hazard devices but, like all pyrotechnics, can still be hazardous and should be stored, handled and used appropriately. Some of the most common examples of consumer pyrotechnics encountered include recreational fireworks (including whistling and sparking types), model rocket motors, highway and marine distress flares, sparklers and caps for toy guns. Pyrotechnics are also indirectly involved in other consumer products such as powder actuated nail guns, ammunition for firearms, and modern fireplaces. Some types, including <b>bird</b> <b>scarers,</b> shell crackers, whistle crackers and flares, may be designed to be fired from a 12-gauge pistol or rifle.|$|R
50|$|Propane scare cannons {{are one of}} {{the most}} common types of <b>bird</b> <b>scarer</b> {{available}} in Europe and America. The propane powered gas gun which produces a periodic explosion. The audible bang can reach very loud volumes in excess of 150 decibels, causing a flight reaction in birds. The similarity between a scare cannon and a 12 gauge shotgun is thought to cause a startle/fear reaction, although it is also effective against birds that have not been exposed to hunting pressure.|$|E
50|$|Technically, the Sonic Nets {{technology}} {{is not a}} <b>bird</b> <b>scarer,</b> but discourages birds from flying into or spending time in the target area. The impact to the birds is similar to talking in a crowded room, and since they cannot understand each other they go somewhere else. Early tests at an aviary and initial field trials at a landfill and airfield indicate that the {{technology is}} effective and that birds do not habituate to the sound. The provisional and full patents were filed in 2013 and 2014 respectively, with further research and commercialization of the technology being ongoing.|$|E
50|$|Significant {{problems}} {{occur with}} airports where the grounds were or have become nesting areas for birds. While fences can prevent a moose or deer from wandering onto a runway, birds {{are more difficult}} to control. Often airports employ a type of <b>bird</b> <b>scarer</b> that operates on propane to cause a noise loud enough to scare away any birds that might be in the vicinity. Airport managers use any means available (including trained falcons) to reduce bird populations. Another solution under investigation is the use of artificial turf near runways, since it does not offer food, shelter, or water to wildlife.|$|E
50|$|The {{exclusion}} of livestock from the native forest allows {{the forest to}} regenerate and create more suitable habitat. Some illegal hunting and poisoning continues because of the damage this pigeon can do to crops, and the government allowed a cull in 2004. Perhaps the main limiting factor on {{the rate at which}} the pigeon increases its numbers is predation by introduced black rats on its eggs and young. The Parque Natural da Madeira national park has a management plan for the trocaz pigeon, and it is hoped that an education campaign and the promotion of <b>bird</b> <b>scarers</b> may reduce persecution. Its increasing population means that it is now classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, an improvement on its Threatened status in 1988. This species is protected under the European Union Birds Directive, and the laurel forests under the Habitats Directive.|$|R
5|$|Scientists and conservationists (most {{importantly}} BirdLife International {{and their}} partners, {{who run the}} Save the Albatross campaign) are working with governments and fishermen to find solutions to the threats albatrosses face. Techniques such as setting longline bait at night, dyeing the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, {{increasing the amount of}} weight on lines and using <b>bird</b> <b>scarers</b> can all reduce the seabird bycatch. For example, a collaborative study between scientists and fishermen in New Zealand successfully tested an underwater setting device for longliners which set the lines below the reach of vulnerable albatross species. The use of some of these techniques in the Patagonian toothfish fishery in the Falkland Islands is thought to have reduced the number of black-browed albatross taken by the fleet in the last 10 years. Conservationists have also worked on the field of island restoration, removing introduced species that threaten native wildlife, which protects albatrosses from introduced predators.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{emphasis}} in Africa by {{national and regional}} plant protection organizations to control pest birds, traditional farmers usually are still {{left to their own}} initiative, as they have been for centuries, to protect their crops. These farmers employ many ingenious visual and oratory frightening techniques, barriers, agronomic planting or harvesting modifications, and bird population-suppression methods. Under some circumstances these methods can reduce damage. However, their effectiveness is subject to such variables as the season of the year, the type and maturation stage of the crop, the pest species and its abundance, the size and ownership of the field, and the diligence and enthusiasm of the <b>bird</b> <b>scarers.</b> The inability of farmers to consistently and successfully protect their crops from birds encourages feelings of frustration, and often leads to their abandoning farming. Clearly practical, economical, and applicable solutions are needed by traditional farmers if future food production goals are going to be met. Research and extension can provide these solutions...|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, Dr. John Swaddle and Dr. Mark Hinders at the College of William and Mary {{created a}} new method of {{deterring}} birds and other animals using benign sounds projected by conventional and directional (parametric) speakers.

40|$|Abstract—The {{most common}} {{domestic}} birds live in Turkey are: crows (Corvus corone), pigeons (Columba livia), sparrows (Passer domesticus), starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and blackbirds (Turdus merula). These birds give {{damage to the}} agricultural areas and make dirty the human life areas. In order to send away these birds, some different materials and methods such as chemicals, treatments, colored lights, flash and audible scarers are used. It is possible to see many studies about chemical methods in the literatures. However {{there is not enough}} works regarding audible bird scarers are reported in the literature. Therefore, a solar powered <b>bird</b> <b>scarer</b> was designed, manufactured and tested in this experimental investigation. Firstly, to understand the sensitive level of these domestic birds against to the audible scarer, many series preliminary studies were conducted. These studies showed that crows are the most resistant against to the audible <b>bird</b> <b>scarer</b> when compared with pigeons, sparrows, starlings and blackbirds. Therefore the solar powered audible <b>bird</b> <b>scarer</b> was tested on crows. The scarer was tested about one month during April-May, 2007. 18 different common known predators ’ sounds (voices or calls) of domestic birds from Falcon (Falco eleonorae), Falcon (Buteo lagopus), Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), Montagu’s harrier (Circus pygargus) and Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) were selected for test of the scarer. It was seen from the results that the reaction of the birds was changed depending on the predators ’ sound type, camouflage of the scarer, sound quality and volume, loudspeaker play and pause periods in one application. In addition, it was also seen that the sound from Falcon (Buteo lagopus) was most effective on crows and the scarer was enough efficient. Keywords—Bird damage; Audible scarer; Solar powered scarer; Predator sound. ...|$|E
40|$|Often {{perceived}} as pests, pigeon control is applied without investigating environmental, ecological and anthropogenic factors which affect their populations {{and response to}} controls. Estate Management of the University of South Africa’s Muckleneuk campus identified a need to investigate and address a perceived pigeon problem. Staff perceptions regarding the presence and attitude towards control of the pigeons was undertaken through an online Survey Monkey questionnaire and semi- structured interviews until saturation was achieved. It was determined that the a s sumed negative perception towards the pigeons was in fact incorrect. Participants would rather encourage the nesting and breeding activities of pigeons on campus, as they felt that the human–pigeon interactions and viewing of squabs in nests contributed positively to their work environment. Participants did not consider the pigeons or their related activities to pose a problem. It was felt that should control be imposed, the birds should rather be humanely managed through non-lethal measures rather than eradication. Pigeon numbers on five buildings on the University’s campus were counted at dawn and dusk, every week, for two years. The first year provided baseline data and the second year was when control measures were applied. The study determined that the pigeon population index fluctuated seasonally while breeding occurred throughout the year, with notable peaks and declines relating to physiological and population dynamics. The pigeons seemed to make opportunistic use of crop availability in surrounding farmlands during optimal production periods, while conserving energy when not favourable. Site selection in relation to building aspect indicated significant differences in all the seasons except for winter, while a positive significant relationship between level height and pigeon number was recorded. Once the control measures were applied, the total pigeon index on the campus declined by 50 %. Control structures differed significantly in efficacy. Bird spikes indicated the highest efficacy at reducing the pigeon population index and seasonality did influence this efficiency. Birds of prey and an audio <b>bird</b> <b>scarer</b> were used to compare actual versus implied predator presence, {{it was determined that}} there was an association between method of scaring and the number of pigeons observed on the different time periods. Pigeons were observed to continue the natural trend of dispersion and return at the dawn and dusk counts during the audio <b>bird</b> <b>scarer</b> trial without being actively discouraged or dislodged from the building. Pigeons reacted positively to the visual raptor presence, which caused them to take flight from the buildings. The visual effect was only temporary however as pigeons returned once the threat had been removed 10 minutes post scare. The studies concluded in an interdisciplinary management plan presented to the University Estates. Environmental ScienceM. Sc. (Environmental Science...|$|E

40|$|Problems {{caused by}} {{birds in the}} agricultural, horticultural, {{recreational}} and the aviation industries are escalating world wide as man develops environments that are attractive to birds. Chemical repellents, <b>bird</b> <b>scarers,</b> and exclusion netting {{are being used to}} keep birds away by taste, fright and containment. Habitat management using grasses with selected endophytes may be a new tool for minimizing bird nuisance problems in these industries. Canada geese (Branta Canadensis) were offered selected ryegrass/endophyte Neotyphodium lolli seed and herbage {{to examine the effects of}} known endophyte alkaloids on their feeding behavior in 2000 - 2001. Forty geese were captured annually, contained in fenced areas by wing clipping and fed entophyte-free herbage and seed for a 3 -week period prior to starting any treatments. In a choice 60;cafeteria 61; and no choice feeding trial, geese consumed 30 % less herbage containing the selected endophyte than the endophyte-free ryegrass herbage. In a seed feeding trial, the geese did not discriminate on first exposure between the endophyte-free seed and that containing the selected endophytes. However, on day two there was an 80 % rejection of the seed containing the selected ryegrass/endophyte compared to the endophyte-free seed. The same rejection of 80 % was observed after a 3 -month endophyte-free feeding period, suggesting the rejection was a long-term, learned response or post-digestion feedback. The authors suggest continued research into this area will be of benefit in producing a living deterrent to birds by habitat modification. Learned-behavior response has been well documented in the past as the way forward. Farming grass/endophyte associations may add to mankind’s armory of bird-control methodology...|$|R
5|$|Conservationists {{are working}} with governments and {{fisheries}} {{in order to prevent}} further declines and increase populations of endangered procellariids. Progress has been made in protecting many colonies where most species are most vulnerable. On 20 June 2001, the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels was signed by seven major fishing nations. The agreement lays out a plan to manage fisheries by-catch, protect breeding sites, promote conservation in the industry, and research threatened species. The developing field of island restoration, where introduced species are removed and native species and habitats restored, has been used in several procellariid recovery programmes. Invasive species such as rats, feral cats and pigs have been either removed or controlled in many remote islands in the tropical Pacific (such as the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands), around New Zealand (where island restoration was developed), and in the south Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The grey-faced petrels of Whale Island (mentioned above) have been achieving much higher fledging successes after the introduced Norway rats were finally completely removed. At sea, procellariids threatened by long-line fisheries can be protected using techniques such as setting long-line bait at night, dying the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, increasing the amount of weight on lines and using <b>bird</b> <b>scarers</b> can all reduce the seabird by-catch. A further step towards conservation has been the signing of the 2001 treaty the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, which came into force in 2004 and has been ratified by eight countries, Australia, Ecuador, New Zealand, Spain, South Africa, France, Peru and the United Kingdom. The treaty requires these countries to take specific actions to reduce by-catch and pollution and to remove introduced species from nesting islands.|$|R

40|$|Ten {{years ago}} I waxed lyrical on the deep, {{indelible}} ties {{of the sounds}} of Dartmoor with its inhabitants (Drever 2002), betraying an inclination towards what Sterne’s has called the audio-visual litany (Sterne 2003). In this endeavour I added a sonic turn to Tuan’s concept of topophilia (Tuan 1974) : “fleeting visual pleasure; the sensual delight of physical contact; the fondness for place because it is familiar, because it is home and incarnates the past, because it evokes pride of ownership or of creation; joy in things because of animal health and vitality. " My notion of topophonophilia stressed the affirmative relationships between place, the sensation of sound and sentiment. Those of us who research and practice soundscapes, tacitly extol the positive attributes of sound and hearing with relation to space and place. We talk of how through sound we connect, locate, embody, discern and immerse. Through my recent research I am urged to propose that the opposite is also a reality: sound isolates, excludes, disconnects, disembodies and dislocates from the material and social world. Through {{a study of the}} impact of noise from high-speed hand dryers, my research uncovered a wide range of vulnerable groups that due to the sensitivity of their hearing or particular hearing requirements led to elevated anxiety, fear, pain and confusion and were in some cases exacerbating their social avoidance. These groups included infants; the elderly; partially sighted people; hearing aid users; and people with dementia, cerebral palsy, Ménière's disease, phonophobia, hyperacusis, or hyperacute hearing in the context of autism and Asperger's syndrome. In the case of autism exposure to noise can even lead to a shutdown. Following on from this study I came across an extensive range of environmental sounds that are causing suffering to these groups: <b>bird</b> <b>scarers,</b> mosquito alarm, classroom noise, traffic noise, waves on a beach and even the dawn chorus. With reference to Beethoven, Grandin, Canetti, Kafka and Noël Coward as well as new interview material, this paper will explore the sensory threshold shift of the sensitive hearer, and the sensitising of hearing, including the use of sonic thresholds to control subgroups. In conclusion, I propose a new paradigm for understanding hearing that extends from a medical classification of the otologically normal to a socio-cultural conception of the auraltypical. Within what I see as the hegemony of the auraltypical, I call for a new agenda of auraldiversity within acoustics and sound studies...|$|R
