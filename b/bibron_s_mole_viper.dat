40|$|Problems {{experienced}} {{with the land}} fill disposal of highly corrosive acid tar wastes mean that alternative, less environmentally damaging methods of disposal must be employed. The incineration of acid tars, although possessing several advantages over landfill disposal, can lead to unacceptably high SO 2 -emission concentrations in the flue gases unless precautions are taken. However, such incinerations have been achieved successfully in the present tests with a two-stage fluidised-bed combustor: the attained combustion efficiencies were high (at around 99 %). The use of a fluidised-bed combustor for burning acid tar requires that limestone {{be added to the}} bed material in order to provide some degree of sulphur capture. The sensitivity of the SO 2 emission to the limestone concentration (as indicated by the Ca: <b>S</b> <b>mole</b> ratio) fell as the Ca: S ratio was increased. At a Ca: <b>S</b> <b>mole</b> ratio of 4 : 1, 91 % sulphur retention was achieved. During this test, 340 kg/h acid tar was pumped into the bed and burnt there successfully with 98 kg/h coal: the bed's temperature and height, and the excess oxygen-in-flue concentration were kept constant. Ultimately, average SO 2 emission-levels (in the flue gas) of around 417 ppm were thereby achieved; i. e., well below the 600 ppm SO 2 -emission limit stipulated by the Commission of the European Communities. Nevertheless, the fluctuations in the SO 2 emissions meant that a slightly higher Ca: S ratio of 5 : 1 was recommended {{in order to ensure that}} the emission levels were consistently below the required limit, i. e., such that 97 % of all the mean 48 -hourly values would not exceed 110 % of the stipulated emission limit. ...|$|R

The structural, chemical, and thermal properties of the as-synthesized phase pure systems were investigated with various characterization techniques, including powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), BET gas sorption, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), energy dispersive X-ray scpectroscopy (EDX), thermogravimetric analysis coupled to mass scpectroscopy (TGA-MS), as well as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) methods. In this study, the phase pure covellite has shown a potential ability to remove Hg(II) in aqueous system with maximum sorption capacity of ca. 400 mg/ g {{can be reached at}} pH 4. The collected experimental data is best fitted to Langmuir isotherm and the sorption of Hg(II) onto covellite in aqueous system is favored {{in a wide range of}} pH. This was supported by the calculated thermodynamic parameter, ΔG° which has shown that the sorption of Hg(II) onto covellite is favorable in a wide range of pH, particularly at low pH. Apart from that, three synthesis parameters (synthesis temperature, Cu: <b>S</b> <b>mole</b> ratio, and synthesis time) have been systematically investigated throughout the study. It was found that synthesis temperature and Cu: <b>S</b> <b>mole</b> ratio determined the phase purity, crystal phase, and morphology of the final products formed; while synthesis time has pronounced effect on the crystallite size of the yields. Furthermore, several mechanistic pathways leading to the final formation of covellite were proposed and discussed based on the detailed analysis of PXRD done at different synthesis temperatures. This current study also revealed that the renowned most stable phase in copper sulfide family, covellite has transformed into a mixed phase of pentahydrate copper sulfate and covellite at ambient condition after a certain period. It could be shown that covellite is an air-sensitive material which undergoes structural changes after exposure to moisture or air. This discovery was supported with various observations from PXRD, EDX, and TG-MS techniques. Therefore, phase stability study was conducted to find out the most efficient way to store copper sulfides besides to investigate the stability of covellite over a series of time at ambient condition. The phase stability experiments indicated that covellite with the common washing and storage methods described in the research methodology was stable up to 4 weeks.

Scanning electron microscopy of In 2 S 3 revealed a microsized, 3 D-connected sheet-like shape, which was confirmed by X-ray diffraction to be a beta-structure. The efficiency of the dye-sensitized solar cells assembled with a layer grown with In 2 S 3 increased with increasing In 2 <b>S</b> 3 <b>mole</b> concentrations to 0. 05 [*]M (1. 02 %) but decreased at concentrations greater than 0. 6 ~ 0. 8 %.

30|$|Numerous {{models for}} {{predicting}} gas condensate dew point pressure have been derived from large databases in the literature. There are essentially {{two types of}} published models for estimating dew point pressure in gas condensate reservoirs. One type of models uses detailed compositional analysis that requires laboratory PVT experiments, while another type uses easily measured parameters from production tests and down-hole temperature as inputs. Marruffo et al. (2002), Nemeth and Kennedy (1966), Elsharkawy (2001, 2011), Shokir (2008), Olds et al. (1944), and Godwin (2012) require detailed compositional analysis. Marruffo et al. (2002) used nonlinear regression to fit appropriate models and build their model, applying statistical tools such as residual analyses and cross-plots. The developed model required information from production tests, but did not require the knowledge of gas condensate composition. The original total PVT data sample size they used was 148. After the process of selection and validation, the database was reduced to 114 data points. Nemeth and Kennedy (1966) used 579 data points from 480 different hydrocarbon systems to develop a model that predicts dew point pressure with an average deviation of 7.4 %. The model input parameters are variables measured in the laboratory with composition in mole fraction for CH 4 through C 7 H 16, N 2, CO 2, H 2 S, and molecular weight and specific gravity of heptane plus fraction. Their work is regularly quoted {{in many of the}} more recent models. Elsharkawy (2001) developed a physically sound empirical method for predicting dew point pressure based on routinely measured gas analysis and reservoir temperature. In total, 340 measurements of dew point pressure were used, resulting in a model with an absolute average of 7.68 %. The model included the effect of all variables such as temperature, gas condensate composition, and properties of the plus fraction on dew point pressure. Elsharkawy (2001, 2011) discussed the two types of dew points applicable to any hydrocarbon mixtures. The first dew point occurs when dry gas is compressed to the point that liquid starts to form. The second called retrograde or condensate dew point and occurs when a gas mixture containing heavy hydrocarbons in its solution is depressurized until liquid forms. He presented models for dew point prediction based on gas composition and reservoir temperature. His database included 340 data points. Shokir (2008) used genetic programming to develop a model for dew point pressure prediction from 245 gas condensate systems. The developed model uses the full composition of the gas (CH 4 through C 7 H 16 +, N 2, CO 2, and H 2 <b>S</b> <b>mole</b> fractions) in addition to the molecular weight of the heptanes plus fraction, and reservoir temperature. He also tested his model against other published models. Olds et al. (1944) studied the behavior of six symmetrically chosen mixtures from Paloma field for a range of parameters (temperatures ranged from 100 to 250  °F and pressures up to 5000 psia). They studied the influence of pressure and temperature on the composition and the retrograde gas dew point, and implemented a graphical examination in order to obtain a chart correlating volumetric and phase behavior with the composition of the system and temperature. Godwin (2012) used data from the literature and developed a dew point estimation model based on gas composition, reservoir temperature, and properties of the heptanes plus fraction. A total of 259 out of 273 data points were selected to build the new model, and 14 data points were used for testing.|$|R

The heavy metals lead, cadmium, and zinc were precipitated from aqueous solutions with sodium di-(n-octyl) phosphinate (NaL) {{in the form of}} PbL 2 (s), CdL 2 (s), and ZnL 2 (<b>s).</b> The <b>mole</b> ratio of NaL to lead in the feed was varied from 0. 1 to 6. 5, depending on the acidity of the feed. The effects of the feed pH, concentration of chloride, concentration of calcium, and of the chain length of the precipitating agent on the removal of lead, were investigated. Adding acid to the feed solution reduced the removal of lead as some of the phosphinate precipitated in the acid form as HL(s). The presence of chloride or calcium in the feed solution, up to mole ratios to lead of 250 and 2. 75, respectively, had no effect on the removal of lead. The solubility of the precipitate PbL 2 (s) was reduced by increasing the length of the alkyl group of the phosphinate. The removal of cadmium, zinc, and a mixture of lead, cadmium and zinc was investigated. Behavior similar to that of lead was observed. The selectivity of the precipitating agent for the three metals was in the order Zn > Pb > Cd. The precipitating agent was completely regenerated by adding NaOH to the precipitate, and then contacted with diethyl ether to extract the reagent. The lead was completely recovered from the PbL 2 (s). Pure lead-free precipitating agent, and an aqueous solution of lead at a concentration 100 times its concentration in the feed, were obtained. Using measured solubility products of the precipitates and literature values of the stability constants for the other expected reactions, the removal of metal, the loss of precipitating agent, and the equilibrium pH were predicted...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of the ribosomal protein S 1 from E. coli MRE 600 with oligonucleotides was studied by hydrodynamic, spectrophotometric, and kinetic methods. UV-difference spectra which are induced by the complex formation could be separated into a hyperchromic contribution originating from the nucleic acid moiety and a hypochromic contribution from the protein. Systematic determination of binding and rate constants {{was carried out by}} the temperature-jump relaxation technique. From the quantitative evaluation of the relaxation times and the relaxation amplitudes, the following conclusions could be drawn: The stoichiometry of the complex formation is one <b>mole</b> <b>S</b> 1 per one mole oligonucleotide. The binding constant K, the recombination rate constant kR, and the dissociation rate constant kD, respectively, were measured at different temperatures. The values at 10 degrees C are K = 2 x 10 (6) M- 1, kR = 1. 3 x 10 (8) M- 1 S- 1, kD = 65 s- 1 for A(pA) 12 and K = 7. 5 x 10 (5) M- 1, kR = 6. 8 x 10 (7) M- 1 S- 1, kD = 90 S- 1 for U(pU) 12. Discrepancies with data reported elsewhere are discussed. The stacking-unstacking equilibrium of the free oligonucleotide is frozen if the oligonucleotide is bound to the protein.

40|$|The α-relaxation {{dynamics}} of 1 -cyano-adamantane (CNA) and its mixtures with 1 -chloro-adamantane (ClA) {{has been studied}} by means of broadband dielectric spectroscopy. The existence of orientationally disordered (OD) face centered cubic mixed crystals (ClA 1 −XCNAX) for 0. 5 ≤ X ≤ 1 has been put in evidence by thermodynamics and structural analyses. In addition to the OD phase of CNA, mixed crystals with compositions higher than the equimolar one exhibit a freezing of the orientational degrees of freedom into a glassy state, which involves also a strong increase of the antiferroelectric order at temperatures higher than the dielectric glass transition temperature. This experimental evidence is revealed by a stairlike effect in the variation of the Kirkwood factor with the temperature {{as a consequence of}} a twin effect in the dielectric strength without any anomaly in the temperature-density curves. The characteristic relaxation times are analyzed as a function of temperature and mole fraction.

40|$|AbstractA stopped-flow spectrofluorometer {{equipped}} with a rapid scanning emission monochromator was utilized to monitor the binding of adriamycin to phospholipid liposomes. The latter process is evident as a decrease in fluorescence emission from a trace amount of a pyrene-labeled phospholipid analog (PPDPG, 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -[(6 -pyren- 1 -yl) ]decanoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phospho-rac-glycerol) used as a donor for resonance energy transfer to adriamycin. For zwitterionic 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (POPC) liposomes, fluorescence decay was slow, with a half-time t 1 / 2 of ∼ 2 <b>s.</b> When the <b>mole</b> fraction of the acidic phospholipid, 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phospho-rac-glycerol (POPG), was increased to XPG≥ 0. 04, the decay of fluorescence became double exponential, and an additional, significantly faster process with t 1 / 2 in the range between 2 and 4 ms was observed. Subsequently, as XPG was increased further, the amplitude of the fast process increased, whereas the slower process was attenuated, its t 1 / 2 increasing to 20 s. Increasing [NaCl] above 50 mM or [CaCl 2] above 150 μM abolished the fast component, thus confirming this interaction to be electrostatic. The critical dependence of the fast component on XPG allows {{the use of this}} process to probe the organization of acidic phospholipids in liposomes. This was demonstrated with 1, 2 -palmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DPPC) liposomes incorporating PPDPG (XPPDPG= 0. 03), i. e., conditions where XPG in fluid bilayers is below the required threshold yielding the fast component. In keeping with the presence of clusters of PPDPG, the fast component was observed for gel-state liposomes. At ∼ 34 °C (i. e., 6 ° below Tm), the slower fluorescence decay also appeared, and it was seen throughout the main phase transition region {{as well as in the}} liquid-crystalline state. The fluorescence decay behavior at temperatures below, above, and at the main phase transition temperature is interpreted in terms of thermal density fluctuations and an intermediate state between gel and liquid-crystalline states being involved in the phospholipid main phase transition. This is the first observation of a cluster constituted by acidic phospholipids controlling the membrane association of a drug...|$|R
40|$|The Colli Albani volcano {{has been}} active since c. 600 ka and is {{presently}} quiescent. Rock stratigraphy indicates that {{the activity of the}} volcano has undergone major changes in terms of eruption style, average eruption rate and location of active vents. The chemistry of the Colli Albani products is remarkably mafic, K-rich and silica undersaturated. Nevertheless, the volcano has experienced all types of eruption styles, from plinian explosive paroxysms, to milder strombolian and hawaiian eruptions, to effusive, including large- and small-scale phreatomagmatism. The first period of activity of the volcano is termed the ‘Vulcano Laziale’ period, and lasted from c. 600 ka to c. 355 ka. During this period, the volcanism was predominantly explosive, with an average eruption rate of 1 km 3 ka 21. At least seven intermediate- to large-volume ignimbrites (VEI 5 – 7) were erupted and emplaced over an area larger than 1600 km 2, forming an extensive ignimbrite shield around the central, continuously forming c. 8 8 km 2 caldera. The caldera complex and the ignimbrite shield are named the ‘Vulcano Laziale edifice’. The Vulcano Laziale edifice can in turn be subdivided into a lower ‘Pisolitic Tuffs succession’ (c. 600 – 500 ka), in which ignimbrites are dominated by large-scale phreatomagmatism associated with the likely presence of an early caldera lake, and an overlying ‘Pozzolane Tuffs succession’, in which ignimbrites show a dominantly magmatic fragmentation style, probably in response to progressive exhaustion of the caldera lake. The typical succession of these mafic ignimbrites is composed of a sub-plinain to plinian basal scoria fall deposit covered by the main dark scoria and ash tabular ignimbrite sheet found as far as. 30 km from the caldera rim and across ridges several hundreds metres in elevation, and is characterized by co-ignimbrite breccias at proximal locations. Major ignimbrites erupted with an average interval of c. 40 ka. After each paroxysmal ignimbrite eruption, volcanic activity was predominantly effusive to mild explosive, and was concentrated along peri-caldera fissure systems, forming continuous scoria cone and lava ridges, together with more explosive eruptions from intracaldera vents. The last major caldera-forming eruption of the Vulcano Laziale period occurred at c. 355 ka, emplacing the ignimbrites of the Villa Senni formation. Following this eruption, the complex Tuscolano-Artemisio peri- and extracaldera fissure system, predominantly composed of scoria cones and lavas, formed in response to the deflation of the caldera and peri-caldera area, together with formation of the intracaldera Faete stratovolcano. These edifices were emplaced between c. 355 and c. 180 ka, an interval termed the ‘Tuscolano–Artemisio–Faete period’. Although similar peri-caldera and intracaldera activity occurred earlier, that is, after each major caldera-forming eruption during the Vulcano Laziale period, the Tuscolano–Artemisio–Faete period was subject to a significant reduction in average eruption rate, by one order of magnitude, of 0. 1 km 3 ka 21, which can be related to a consistent reduction in the deep recharging of the plumbing system, and suggesting why no further ignimbrite eruptions occurred after 355 ka. Peri-caldera activity began along the northern and eastern peri-caldera ring fractures (Tuscolano and Artemisio sections, respectively) and after c. 300 ka progressively migrated outwards to extracaldera positions (Pantano Borghese section) and to the western peri-caldera fractures (<b>S.</b> Maria delle <b>Mole</b> section). The activity of these latter fracture systems ended almost simultaneosly, together with that of the Faete intracaldera stratovolcano, between c. 280 and c. 250 ka. After 250 ka, activity migrated to the south (Monte Due Torri section). The most recent activity along this latter peri-caldera area interfingers (between c. 200 ka and c. 180 ka) with phreatomagmatic products, which instead became dominant in the most recent activity of the Colli Albani volcano. Beginning from c. 200 ka (Via dei Laghi period), the western section of the pericaldera area has been the site of repeated very small- to small-volume, maar-forming phreatomagmatic eruptions, which formed both monogenetic and polygenetic maars, collectively named the Via dei Laghi maar field. The most recent of these maars is the polygenetic Albano maar, which was formed after c. 70 ka by at least seven eruptions migrating along a NW–SE-trending, 3. 5 -km-long fracture. The last eruption of the maar occurred at, 23 ka. Subsequent phreatic activity occurred throughout the Holocene, with lahars originating from dramatic withdrawals of the deep maar lake, at least up to the Eneolithic time (6000 – 5000 years ago) and probably up to Roman times (fourth century BCE), when the Romans dug a tunnel drain to keep the lake at a constant low level. The Albano area is currently the site of volcanic gas emissions, ground uplift and periodic seismic swarms, which may indicate persistent activity of a magmatic body at depth...|$|R
