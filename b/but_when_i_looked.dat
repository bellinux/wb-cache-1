500|$|According to the singer, she {{had written}} several songs prior {{to the release of}} Truth Serum. She confessed that both the writing and {{recording}} process of the EP was very emotional, and that the vocals of the songs were taken from her demos. Truth Serum is a concept record that details Lo's [...] "most intense" [...] relationship from beginning to end. That approach was unintentional, as Lo realized that the tracks talked about the relationship after she had picked them for the EP. She explained; [...] "I didn't plan to write it that way, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at the songs that I had when I was picking ones for the EP, I was like, 'Oh my god, here it is'. I didn't really figure out {{that it was going to}} be the full story right there until I looked and listened". Concerning the title of the EP, the singer decided to call it Truth Serum after she had picked the songs for it; she said in an interview that [...] "when you look at the songs, it's all about honesty and I'm really giving up a lot of myself in these songs; I'm not filtering anything. I felt that kind of speaks a lot for how truthful the EP is".|$|E
2500|$|Stewart {{grew up in}} a poor {{household}} {{with domestic}} violence from his father, an experience which later influenced his political and ideological beliefs. He spent much of his childhood in Jarrow. [...] Stewart's father served with the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and was regimental sergeant major of the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment during the Second World War, having previously worked as a general labourer and as a postman. As a result of his wartime experience during the Dunkirk evacuation, his father suffered from what was then known as combat fatigue (related to what is now known as post-traumatic stress disorder). In a 2008 interview, Stewart said, [...] "My father was a very potent individual, a very powerful man, who got what he wanted. It was said that when he strode onto the parade ground, birds stopped singing. It was many, many years before I realised how my father inserted himself into my work. I've grown a moustache for Macbeth. My father didn't have one, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> in the mirror just before I went on stage I saw my father's face staring straight back at me." ...|$|E

60|$|My year of {{probation}} {{has long since}} ended, and Alice is my wife. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> back upon that trying twelvemonth {{one of the most}} vivid incidents that memory recalls is that associated with my visit to the City of Dust.|$|R

6000|$|... "She {{interested}} {{herself for}} me, and Lord Montfort approved the suggestion. It was {{described to me}} as a family seat, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> into the matter, I found that Lord Beaumaris was more powerful than Lord Montfort." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> {{round at}} his comfortable, and almost luxurious cabin, {{and then at}} his {{handsome}} care-free face, I thought he {{was only trying to}} frighten me, and I answered, [...] "Well, sir, I am ready to try it." ...|$|E

Hopkins later said, [...] "I went at it like a dog, and had a wild, fun time. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> back, <b>I</b> think I'm the luckiest {{guy in the world}} because I don't understand how it all occurred.".|$|R
6000|$|She turned around, {{apparently}} reassured. [...] "You are not {{to think}} that I have been told anything," [...] she said; [...] "I have only guessed. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at you, as you came in, I was sure I had guessed aright." ...|$|E
60|$|And afraid I was {{to knock}} any more; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> {{up to what}} was written over the gate, I took courage.[54] I also thought that I must either knock again, or die; so I knocked, but I cannot tell how, for my spirit now {{struggled}} betwixt life and death.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{before the}} book was published, Toomer’s initial {{euphoria}} began to fade. He wrote, “The book is done <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> for the beauty I thought I’d caught, they thin out and elude me.” He thought that the Georgia sketches lacked complexity {{and said they were}} “too damn simple for me.” In a letter to Sherwood Anderson, Toomer wrote that the story-teller style of “Fern” “had too much waste and made too many appeals to the reader.” ...|$|R
60|$|I {{thought at}} first he was still {{rambling}} in his mind, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at him I saw that his bloodshot eyes were fixed upon me. I placed my hand upon his brow, and though still very hot, I fancied that the skin was not so dry nor so hard as it had been.|$|E
60|$|The {{sound of}} dreadful, swine-like {{breathing}} fell upon our ears. It {{was but a}} glance, {{and then we were}} off hot-foot for home.

[...] "Lassiter!... <b>I</b> shudder <b>when</b> <b>I</b> think of that name, of him. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at the man I forget who he is--I almost like him.

Somehow he knows--much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't seem {{possible}} that the term is nearly over," [...] said Anne. [...] "Why, last fall it seemed so long to look forward to--a whole winter of studies and classes.

6000|$|... "You {{know how}} they fight.

60|$|He {{smiled as}} I looked at these contrivances to while away the time; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> from them to him, I {{saw that his}} lip trembled, and could have counted the beating of his heart.

60|$|That night I slept very contentedly in {{my little}} tent, {{surrounded}} with all my effects; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> {{out in the morning}} no more ship was to be seen. This much surprised me for the present; yet, when I considered I had lost no time, abated no pains and had got every thing useful out of her, I comforted myself in the best manner, and entirely submitted to the will of Providence.|$|E

Something growing silently out of all this blood and mud.

And it isn't only on the faces of our own men. It's {{in the eyes of the}} prisoners too. As if they saw something. A funny ending to the war, if the people began to think." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I have {{to admit}} that man’s growth toward civilization looks slow and unsteady. At moments, whole nations seem to fall back, their people fret for {{deliverance}} from selfish fears. They pay homage to persons who have snatched power for themselves, all manner of tyrants, and people beg them for comfort and for peace. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> beyond the weak spots, I can notice those men who pursue knowledge for the common benefit, or labor for sound structures rather than for gain, or fight and die—not for praise or possessions but for the freedom of others. These are not strange or distant to men." ...|$|R
60|$|She rose to {{her feet}} with grave deliberation. For an instant, with the {{recollection}} of the delicate internal organization of the Saltellos on my mind, I was in agony lest she should totter and fall, even then, yielding up her gentle spirit on the spot. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> again she had a hairpin between her white teeth, and was carefully adjusting her toreador hat. And beside us was Enriquez--cheerful, alert, voluble, and undaunted.|$|E
60|$|His {{words had}} a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and {{sometimes}} felt a wish to console him, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathize with him, I {{had no right to}} withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow.|$|E
60|$|For the rest, he {{was dead}} and broken up by those Amahagger blood-hounds before I could examine him, or his body-armour either, {{and there was an}} end of him and his story. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at the corpse of poor Robertson, which I did as we buried it where he fell, and saw that though so large and thick-set, it was cleft almost in two by a single blow of Rezu's axe, I came to {{understand}} what the might of this savage must have been.|$|E
2500|$|Campbell {{declined}} {{a number}} of positions in the CSA government, but accepted the post of Assistant Secretary of War in 1862. For {{the duration of the}} job, Campbell was criticized for trying to limit the scope of wartime conscription. [...] By late 1864, he was pushing again {{for an end to the}} war. In an 1865 letter to Judge Benjamin R. Curtis, he described the disastrous state of the Confederacy and marveled: [...] "You would suppose there could be no difficulty in convincing men under such circumstances that peace was required. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> back upon the events of the winter, I find that I was incessantly employed in making these facts known and to no result." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; no {{one else}} had such a power of making happy,' said Charles, thoughtfully. 'Amy, I really don't know whether even you owe as much to your husband as I do.

'Not {{stronger}} than he deserves,' said John; 'and if he called upon me {{to express my}} opinion of him to his face, I would {{do so in the}} very same terms, without the least qualification.
