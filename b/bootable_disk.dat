25|$|A rescue <b>disk</b> that is <b>bootable,</b> {{such as a}} CD or USB storage device, {{can be used to}} run {{antivirus}} software outside of the installed operating system, in order to remove infections while they are dormant. A <b>bootable</b> antivirus <b>disk</b> can be useful when, for example, the installed operating system is no longer bootable or has malware that is resisting all attempts to be removed by the installed {{antivirus software}}. Examples of some of these <b>bootable</b> <b>disks</b> include the Avira AntiVir Rescue System, PCTools Alternate Operating System Scanner, and AVG Rescue CD. The AVG Rescue CD software can also be installed onto a USB storage device, that is bootable on newer computers.|$|R
5000|$|... floppyfw was a Linux {{distribution}} running BusyBox {{to provide}} a firewall/gateway/router on a single <b>bootable</b> floppy <b>disk.</b>|$|R
50|$|Parted Magic is a {{commercial}} Linux distribution with disk partitioning and data recovery tools, {{sold as a}} Linux-based <b>bootable</b> <b>disk.</b> The distribution's nomenclature {{is derived from the}} name of the software package GNU Parted.|$|E
50|$|If {{recovering}} partitions {{is needed}} that are damaged {{on the only}} <b>bootable</b> <b>disk</b> in a machine, a live CD can be used such as knoppix to start the machine and use the utilities from the disk.|$|E
50|$|Windows Defender Offline (formerly {{known as}} Standalone System Sweeper Beta) is a {{bootable}} standalone antimalware program {{that runs from}} a <b>bootable</b> <b>disk</b> and is designed to scan infected systems while their operating systems are offline. Since Windows 10 Anniversary Update, offline functionality is integrated into the regular Windows Defender program.|$|E
50|$|The {{final version}} of the MSCDEX program was 2.96, {{included}} with Windows 95 and used when creating <b>bootable</b> floppy <b>disks</b> with CD-ROM support. Starting with Windows 95, CD-ROM access became possible through a 32-bit CDFS driver.|$|R
5000|$|OFS is {{very good}} for {{repairing}} the filesystem {{in the event of}} a problem, although the so-called DiskDoctor provided by Commodore quickly earned the name DiskDestroyer, because it could not repair No-DOS type autostart disks provided by third-party software manufacturers as <b>bootable</b> <b>disks</b> for games. The idea to create non-standard autobootable disks was born in a primitive attempt to prevent copy of such disks and to avoid the loading and launch of Amiga DOS, in order to directly access the Amiga graphic, audio and memory chipsets. DiskDoctor in fact changed autostart disks bootblocks into standard AmigaDOS-based ones, renaming a disk with [...] "Lazarus" [...] namedisk, and made the autostart disk unusable.|$|R
50|$|This {{installation}} mode creates bootable USB flash {{drives and}} <b>bootable</b> USB Hard <b>Disk</b> Drives; it is a Live USB creator.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the user}} has {{selected}} the device they'd {{like to make}} bootable, selected the <b>bootable</b> <b>disk</b> to copy the required libraries and information from, and chosen the programs to include on the DasBoot device, clicking a single button starts {{the process of building}} the required information and copying it to the device.|$|E
50|$|Expressions full disk {{encryption}} (FDE) or whole disk encryption signify {{that everything}} on disk is encrypted, but the {{master boot record}} (MBR), or similar area of a <b>bootable</b> <b>disk,</b> with code that starts the operating system loading sequence, is not encrypted. Some hardware-based full disk encryption systems can truly encrypt an entire boot disk, including the MBR.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] utility {{allows for}} the {{enabling}} or disabling of the TLER parameter in the hard disk's firmware settings allowing the user {{to determine the best}} setting for his particular usage as either a stand-alone or RAID drive. This utility is written for DOS and you will require a DOS <b>bootable</b> <b>disk</b> with this utility on it to use it.|$|E
50|$|Create a {{bootable}} USB flash or {{hard drive}} from a bootable disc image (works only with DOS, Windows NT and syslinux boot sectors). For this, the user can open an ISO image with UltraISO and choose 'Bootable' and 'Write disk image' to burn onto a <b>bootable</b> USB <b>disk.</b>|$|R
50|$|Setting up Windows 10 on a Mac {{requires}} a USB flash drive and the ISO image of Windows 10 provided by Microsoft. Boot Camp reformats the flash drive as a Mac <b>bootable</b> install <b>disk,</b> and combines Windows 10 with install scripts to load hardware drivers for the targeted Mac computer.|$|R
50|$|Newer {{versions}} of EasyBCD also support creating <b>bootable</b> USB <b>disks,</b> by deploying BOOTMGR and the BCD onto a removable disk and performing the necessary actions {{to make the}} drive bootable, after which it can be loaded into EasyBCD to add and remove the various supported entry types {{in order to create}} bootable repair USB sticks.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{start-up}} or {{reset the}} Kickstart performs {{a number of}} diagnostic and system checks and then initializes the Amiga chipset and some core OS components. It will then check for connected boot devices and attempt to boot from {{the one with the}} highest boot priority. If no boot device is present a screen will be displayed asking the user to insert a boot disk typically a floppy disk.Insertion of such a <b>bootable</b> <b>disk</b> (other than workbench-like disk) will result in: ...|$|E
50|$|If a <b>bootable</b> <b>disk</b> is found, the Happy Mac logo is displayed, {{and control}} is {{handed over to}} the Mac OS. If no disk to boot from is present, an icon {{depicting}} a floppy disk with a blinking question mark in the middle will be displayed. If a hardware problem occurs during {{the early part of the}} boot process, the machine will display the Sad Mac icon with a hexadecimal error code and freeze; on Macs made after 1987, this will be accompanied by the Chimes of Death sound.|$|E
50|$|PartitionMagic is a {{computer}} program for hard disk drive partitioning originally made by the PowerQuest corporation, but now owned by Symantec. As of December 8, 2009, the Symantec website stated {{that they no longer}} offer Partition Magic. The program runs on Microsoft Windows operating systems including Windows 2000 and Windows XP, but the application is incompatible with Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 or 10 and must use a <b>bootable</b> <b>disk</b> for partitioning drives instead. The utility can also be run from a bootable CD-ROM and enables creation and modification of partitions. Existing partitions can be resized without loss of data.|$|E
50|$|As of July 2017, {{there is}} an {{abandonware}} site (winworldpc.com) that has available for download a disk image for {{the latest version of}} MS-DOS for the Tandy 2000. It includes instructions for using the IBM 1.2MB 5.25-inch disk drive (80-track) to create a system <b>disk</b> <b>bootable</b> in the Tandy 2000 5.25-inch drive. This procedure {{can also be used to}} create a <b>bootable</b> 3.5-inch system <b>disk</b> using an ordinary 720KB 3.5-inch PC drive; this will boot a Tandy 2000 with its 5.25-inch boot drive replaced with a like 3.5-inch PC drive.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bootable</b> floppy <b>disks</b> (("boot floppies") for PCs usually contain MS-DOS, a workalike such as FreeDOS, or {{miniature}} {{versions of}} Linux. The most commonly available floppy disk can hold only 1.4 MB of data in its standard format, making it impractical for loading large operating systems. The use of boot floppies is in decline, {{due to the}} availability of other higher-capacity options, such as CD-ROMs or USB flash drives.|$|R
5000|$|The MSR {{partition}} is {{not visible}} within the Microsoft Windows Disk Management control utility, {{but it is}} listed (as [...] "Reserved") with the Microsoft Diskpart command line utility. On <b>bootable</b> <b>disks</b> for UEFI systems, the MSR partition is generally the second partition just after the first small partition displayed as [...] "System" [...] (about 100 MB) and containing a FAT32 filesystem (to store the UEFI boot data), before other partitions for the actual main partition Windows (usually mounted on volume C:), or for other OSes (on multiboot systems), or for one or several recovery partitions (usually not mounted but visible in the Microsoft Windows Disk Management control utility). The OEM system recovery partition is usually located either at end of disk (for harddisks with capacity below 1TB), or near the start of disk just after the MSR partition on large disks for UEFI-capable systems (OEM recovery partitions may also be hidden in the Microsoft Windows Disk Management control utility, by using a GPT partition attribute flag: their internal filesystem is generally NTFS or FAT32, {{but they may be}} mounted with Diskpart).|$|R
5000|$|The program {{removed all}} subdirectories and all {{entries in the}} root directory, and then created new files with names such as [...] "" [...] in the root directory, {{corresponding}} to the valid allocation chains that {{were found in the}} FAT area (excluding disk clusters that were tested and found to have hardware errors). A formerly <b>bootable</b> <b>disk</b> would no longer be bootable after Recover had executed. The range of circumstances in which Recover was genuinely useful was quite limited, and well-meaning DOS users sometimes created havoc by running Recover under the misconception that it was a file undelete utility.|$|E
5000|$|Later {{computers}} would {{display a}} message like [...] "No <b>bootable</b> <b>disk</b> found"; some would prompt for a disk to be inserted {{and a key}} to be pressed, and when a key was pressed they would restart the boot process. A modern BIOS may display nothing or may automatically enter the BIOS configuration utility when the boot process fails. Unlike earlier BIOSes, modern versions are often written {{with the assumption that}} if the computer cannot be booted from a hard disk, the user will not have software that they want to boot from removable media instead. (Lately, typically it will only be a specialist computer technician who does that, only to get the computer back into a condition where it can be booted from the hard disk.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The virus {{infected}} Macintosh computers, and {{the intention}} was that on 2 March 1988 all infected computers would show the message [...] "RICHARD BRANDOW, publisher of MacMag, and its entire staff {{would like to}} take this opportunity to convey their UNIVERSAL MESSAGE OF PEACE to all Macintosh users around the world", and the virus would then delete itself. According to the virus itself, it was written by Drew Davidson. The virus was a boot sector virus, which was spread {{in the form of a}} HyperCard stack called [...] "New Apple Products," [...] which contained very poor pictures of the then-new Apple scanner. It copied a resource into the System folder on a Mac, as an [...] "initial" [...] program, which would run automatically every time the system started up. The program then copied itself onto any <b>bootable</b> <b>disk</b> which was opened.|$|E
50|$|A PC booter, or booter, {{is a type}} of {{software}} for home computer era (early 1980s to early 1990s) personal computers that was loaded and executed in the bootup of the computer, from a <b>bootable</b> floppy <b>disk,</b> rather than as a regular program; a booter thus bypassed any operating system that might be installed on the hard disk of the computer. Video games were the type of application most commonly distributed as booters.|$|R
50|$|When Applesoft II BASIC was {{initially}} released in mid-1978, {{it came on}} cassette tape and could be loaded into memory via the Apple II's machine language monitor. When the enhanced Apple II+ replaced the original II in 1979, Applesoft was now included in ROM and automatically started on power-up if no <b>bootable</b> floppy <b>disk</b> was present. Conversely, Integer BASIC was now removed from ROM and turned into an executable file on the DOS 3.3 disk.|$|R
50|$|OS/2 {{allows for}} 'DOS from Drive A:', (VMDISK). This {{is a real}} DOS, like MS-DOS 6.22 or PC DOS 5.00. One makes a <b>bootable</b> floppy <b>disk</b> of the DOS, add a number of drivers from OS/2, and then creates a special image. The DOS booted this way has full access to the system, but {{provides}} its own drivers for hardware. One can use such a disk to access cdrom drives {{for which there is}} no OS/2 driver.|$|R
5000|$|AmigaOS {{originally}} {{included a}} disk-validator on every <b>bootable</b> <b>disk,</b> which {{was prone to}} being replaced by viruses to allow themselves to spread (for example the [...] "Saddam Hussein" [...] virus). Later it {{became part of the}} ROM from Kickstart 2.x onwards, protecting it from malicious replacement. The disk-validator attempted to repair the bitmap on an invalidated drive by write-protecting the drive and scanning it; this could take a long time and made it very slow to access the disk until it was finished, especially on slower media. As hard drives got larger and contained more files, the validation process could take many hours. In addition, files and directories could feasibly be lost (often without the user being notified or even aware) during the process if their data hashes were corrupted. In some cases the validator could fail and leave the disk in a non-validated state, requiring the user to use a third-party disk tool like DiskSalv to make the volume writable again, or simply save the files by copying them to a fresh partition—a very slow process.|$|E
5000|$|The Tandy 1000 HX was {{an updated}} version of the EX. It was mostly the same machine, but instead of one 5.25" [...] drive bay, it had two 3.5" [...] bays on the front panel, {{occupied}} by one 720 KB 3.5" [...] floppy drive. This arrangement improved the computer's desk footprint over the EX, because no space was needed {{to the right of the}} machine to access the drive. It also had Tandy MS-DOS 2.11R in ROM, which could be accessed by starting the computer with no <b>bootable</b> <b>disk</b> present. By putting the basic elements of DOS and Deskmate in ROM and eliminating the memory test on startup, the HX booted quickly compared to other contemporary MS-DOS machines. System settings were changed with a setup program and were stored in EEPROM, and the system could be set to boot a program from the A: drive, boot to DOS or Personal Deskmate 2. The HX used the same 8088-2 and clock speeds as the EX, used the same PLUS cards, the same keyboard, and had the same ports as the EX. It also came with 256 KB of RAM on the motherboard. The HX's sound output had a distinctive grounding loop noise, which was clearly audible when the volume knob was turned up above 50%.|$|E
50|$|Cassette BASIC loads when a PC or PCjr is booted {{without a}} <b>bootable</b> <b>disk</b> or cartridge. Disk BASIC and Advanced BASIC load when their command name (BASIC and BASICA respectively) is typed at a DOS command prompt (except PCjr, which {{activates}} Cartridge BASIC instead), with some optional parameters to control allocation of memory. When loaded, a sign-on identification message displays the program version number, and a full-screen text editor starts (see images, right). The function keys are assigned common commands, which {{display at the}} bottom of the screen. Commands may be typed in to load or save programs, and expressions can be typed in and executed in direct (immediate) mode. If a line of input starts with a number, the language system stores the following line of text as part of program source, allowing a programmer to enter in an entire program line by line, entering line numbers before each statement. When listed on screen, lines are displayed in order of increasing line number. Changes can be made to a displayed line of program source code by moving the cursor to the line with the cursor keys, and typing over the on-screen text. Program source is stored internally in a tokenized form, where keywords are replaced with a single byte token, to save space and execution time. Programs may be saved in compact tokenized form, or optionally saved as DOS text ASCII files that can be viewed and edited with other programs. Like most other DOS applications, IBM BASIC is a text-mode program and has no features for windows, icons, mouse support, or cut and paste editing.|$|E
50|$|An {{unauthorized}} user gaining physical {{access to a}} computer is most likely able to directly copy data from it. They may also compromise security by making operating system modifications, installing software worms, keyloggers, covert listening devices or using wireless mice. Even when the system is protected by standard security measures, these {{may be able to}} be by-passed by booting another operating system or tool from a CD-ROM or other <b>bootable</b> media. <b>Disk</b> encryption and Trusted Platform Module are designed to prevent these attacks.|$|R
5000|$|The Standard Edition can {{complete}} backup {{and restoring}} of disks (including system disks), partitions, files, and folders. It provides {{the ability to}} schedule automated incremental and differential backups. The feature called [...] "universal restore" [...] enables migration of an operating system to physical computers or virtual machines with dissimilar hardware. System and data backups use the Shadow Copy technology, which enables creating backups without interrupting running software. The utility can create a <b>bootable</b> recovery <b>disk</b> based either on Linux or on Windows PE (which supports both BIOS and UEFI).|$|R
5000|$|To upgrade an Eagle III, for instance, {{the user}} {{could buy a}} File 40, connect it to the [...] "Parallel B" [...] port {{on the back of}} the Eagle with the ribbon cable that came with it, turn on the File 40, and turn on the Eagle. If a File 10 or File 40 was {{attached}} and turned on when an Eagle I, II, or III was turned on, the computer booted from the hard disk in the external box, even if a <b>bootable</b> floppy <b>disk</b> was in a floppy-disk drive.|$|R
