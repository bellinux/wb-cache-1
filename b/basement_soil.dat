Differentiated landscape acpcunted for differentiation of settlement points and economic activities of the inhabitants. Diversity of structural forms in Norway in the Middle Ages testifies that wooden construction was well developed there already then. Types of timber-work in Norway and in most coastal areas of the Baltic were generally {{based on the same}} designs although they differed between them sometimes quite substantially in various details. The pine-tree was providing the most important timber. The oldest Norwegian housing construction, like in the entire Scandinavia, did not make a full use of timber using it mainly as pillars or for roof structures. Walls, on the other hand, were erected from stone and earth or from plaited materials covered with clay. In Norwegian houses timber-framework structures date back to loth century but it may have just as well appeared earlier showing from the very beginning a well- -developed form. All the remaining structures, with the exception of framework structures, can be generally classified as pillar structures with this element playing one of more important roles in construction of walls. Approached more widely, pillar-board structures are a common phenomenon of all- -European character, while in a more narrow approach - a North-European phenomenon. Pillarboard structures represent this type of construction in which the wall elements are situated vertically. This term is often used in Norway for walle filled with vertically inserted boards. A classical form of such structures are Norwegian churohes, the so-called "stavkirke". Foundations under Norwegian houses differed one from another depending upon the <b>basement</b> <b>soil</b> and wall construction. Sometimes foundations from beams or stones were used alone. Sometimes walls were separated from the wet <b>basement</b> <b>soil</b> by means of dug-in trunk-pillars in corners. Three kinds of floors can be distinguished in Norwegian houses: 1 - earth-clay floors, 2 - stone floors, 3 - wooden floors. Fire-placee were usually placed either in corners or in the centre of a room. Centrally situated fire-places had wooden frames or frames from atone plates. Reconstruction of roof bondings seems to present most problems. This article does not aim at comprehensive analysis of such a rich research area as wooden construction in Norway.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors give a {{solution}} to the problem of the impact of a rolling stock on the rail track on the basis of modeling a railway track as a multi-layered space, introducing each of the layers is a quasi-elastic orthotropic layer with cylindrical anisotropy in the polar coordinate system. The article describes wave equations, taking into account the rotational inertia of cross sectional and transverse shear strains. From the point of view of classical structural mechanics train path can be represented as a multilayer system comprising separate layers with different stiffness, lying on the foundation being the elastic-isotropic space. Winkler model provides that the basis is linearly deformable space, there are loads influencing its surface. These loads are transferred through a layered deformable half-space. This representation is used in this study as an initial approximation. For more accurate results of the deformation of a railway track because of rolling dynamic loads it is proposed to present a railway track in the form of a layered structure, where each element (assembled rails and sleepers, ballast section, the soil in the embankment, <b>basement</b> <b>soils)</b> is modeled as a planar quasi-elastic orthotropic layer with cylindrical anisotropy. The equations describing the dynamic behaviour of flat element in a polar coordinate system are hyperbolic in nature and take into account the rotational inertia of the cross sectional and the transverse shear strains. This allows identifying the impact on the final characteristics of the blade wave effects, and oscillatory processes. In order to determine the unknown functions included in the constitutive equations it is proposed to use decomposition in power series in spatial coordinate and time. In order to determine the coefficients of ray series for the required functions, it is necessary to differentiate the defining wave equations k times on time, to take their difference on the different sides of the wave surface, and apply the consistency condition for the transition from the jump of the derivative of a function in the coordinate to the jump of the derivative of a sought function in time of higher order. The proposed approach allows considering the whole structure of the railway track in the form of a set of layers, making for each layer (rail - sleeper; sleeper - ballast; ballast - ballast bed) a system of equations and solving them. Therefore it is possible to vary the characteristics of different layers and their modules of elasticity, determining the optimal thickness of the ballast layer or oversleeper and undersleeper strips...|$|R

The two studied sites belong to the same geographic area and the same geological <b>basement</b> and <b>soils,</b> but were by subjected to different agricultural practices in terms of irrigation and supply of fertilizers and protection products. The conventional and biological agriculture modalities were defined and tested. Homogeneous 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios were measured in the various organs of the trees from a given site. However, the composition was significantly different at the two studied sites. When considering a biological agricultural modality, significant correlations are obtained between the Sr isotopic composition of the tree organs, the soils and the irrigation waters. The mobile and exchangeable fractions of the soils have identical 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios that were transferred to the trees. In case of a conventional agriculture with more intensive irrigation and spreading of plant-protection products, a clear impact of these products is visible in the soils. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of the olive trees not only derives from soil sources, but also from added products with a clear role of the irrigation.

However, when wetted under load many such soils undergo a marked and sudden increase in settlement, the phenomenon which is known as collapse settlement. Prodigious development have taken place on potentially collapsible soils in South Africa, especially on the Berea Red Sands, the granitic soils of the Highveld, residual <b>Basement</b> Granite <b>soils</b> in the Lowveld (markedly the Witrivier, Tzaneen and Bushbuck Ridge areas) as well as recently on the Kalahari Aeolian Sands in the Lephalale area. Even though levels of development have been intense in such areas, the subject of collapsible soils has not received much attention in South Africa in recent years, with very little being published on the subject since Schwartz’s {{state of the art}} paper on collapsible soils in 1985. Soil suction can be {{considered one of the most}} important parameters describing the stress state at different moisture conditions in an unsaturated soil. Generally, porous materials have the ability to attract and retain water. This ability is described as suction, and can thus be seen as the attraction the soil exerts on the moisture. The collapse process in partly saturated soils is best considered in terms of two separate components of effective stress; the applied stress and the suction. During this research the collapse phenomenon in South African soils was investigated by focussing on the collapse mechanism of dry or partially saturated collapsible soils during the incremental increase in soil moisture content under constant load. Samples were collected from both typically collapsible residual and collapsible transported soils in an effort to relate the collapse behaviour of the material to its geological origin. The change in suction pressure with change in moisture content for the same materials was monitored and related back to the collapse process. Subsequently the influence of the applied stress and suction pressures on the collapse behaviour could be compared for each material.

The regolith thus includes fractured and weathered <b>basement</b> rocks, saprolites, <b>soils,</b> organic accumulations, volcanic material, glacial deposits, colluvium, alluvium, evaporitic sediments, aeolian deposits and ground water. ” At large scales, patterns in regolith {{can be observed in}} relation to geology and climate (e. g., Costin 1954).

40|$|International audienceIn natural river systems, the {{chemical}} and isotopic composition of stream- and ground waters are mainly controlled by the geology and water­rock interactions. The leaching of major cations from soils has been recognized as a possible consequence of acidic deposition from atmosphere for over 30 years. Moreover, in agricultural areas, the application of physiological acid fertilizers and nitrogen fertilizers in the ammonia form may enhance the cation leaching through the soil profile into groundand surface waters. This origin of leached cations has been studied on two small and adjacent agricultural catchments in Brittany, western France. The study catchments are drained by two first-order streams, and mainly covered with cambisoils, issued from the alteration and weathering of a granodiorite <b>basement.</b> Precipitations, <b>soil</b> water- and NH 4 acetate-leachates, separated minerals, and stream waters have been investigated. Chemical element ratios, such as Ba/Sr, Na/Sr and Ca/Sr ratios, as well as Sr isotopic ratios are used to constrain the relative contribution from potential sources of stream water elements. Based on Sr isotopic ratio and element concentration, soil water- and NH 4 acetate leaching indicates (1) a dominant manure/slurry contribution in the top soil, representing a cation concentrated pool, with low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios; (2) in subsoils, mineraldissolution is enhanced by fertilizer application, becoming the unique source of cations in the saprolite. The relatively high weathering rates encountered implies significant sources of cations which are not accessory minerals, but rather plagioclase and biotite dissolution. Stream water has a very different isotopic and chemical composition compared to soil water leaching suggesting that stream water chemistry is dominated by elements issued from mineral and rock weathering. Agriculture, by applications of chemical and organic fertilizers, can influence the export of major base cations, such as Na+. Plagioclase dissolution, rather than anthropogenically controlled soil water, {{seems to be the}} dominant source of Na+ in streams. However, Ca 2 + in streams is mostly derived from slurries and manures deposited on top soils, and transferred into the soil ion-exchange pool and stream waters.

When an internationally reputable scientist such as Retallack questions the majority view in Australia I begin to worry. To me regolith is simply all the material between fresh rock and fresh air. The point of contention that Retallack raises is, I think, whether it should include lithified (a process that converts unconsolidated sediments into rock) or fresh rocks where they are produced by surface or near-surface processes and are sandwiched between softer materials of weathering or sedimentary origin. So, a fresh basalt flow sandwiched between weathered basalt or weathered bedrock and weathered basalt or sedimentary regolith would in my mind be part of the regolith. Equally, one of the hardest rocks we see in Australia, silcrete, is well lithified but in Retallack’s mind would not constitute part of the regolith because it is lithified. I think we can agree that this latter example is clearly part of the regolith, but the basalt flow—well, it’s up to you, but basal...|$|R

40|$|The {{inadvertent}} intruder analysis {{considers the}} radiological impacts to hypothetical {{persons who are}} assumed to inadvertently intrude on the Portsmouth OSWDF site after institutional control ceases 100 years after site closure. For {{the purposes of this}} analysis, we assume that the waste disposal in the OSWDF occurs at time zero, the site is under institutional control for the next 100 years, and inadvertent intrusion can occur over the following 1, 000 year time period. Disposal of low-level radioactive waste in the OSWDF must meet a requirement to assess impacts on such individuals, and demonstrate that the effective dose equivalent to an intruder would not likely exceed 100 mrem per year for scenarios involving continuous exposure (i. e. chronic) or 500 mrem for scenarios involving a single acute exposure. The focus in development of exposure scenarios for inadvertent intruders was on selecting reasonable events that may occur, giving consideration to regional customs and construction practices. An important assumption in all scenarios is that an intruder has no prior knowledge of the existence of a waste disposal facility at the site. Results of the analysis show that a hypothetical inadvertent intruder at the OSWDF who, in the worst case scenario, resides on the site and consumes vegetables from a garden established on the site using contaminated soil (chronic agriculture scenario) would receive a maximum chronic dose of approximately 7. 0 mrem/yr during the 1000 year period of assessment. This dose falls well below the DOE chronic dose limit of 100 mrem/yr. Results of the analysis also showed that a hypothetical inadvertent intruder at the OSWDF who, in the worst case scenario, excavates a <b>basement</b> in the <b>soil</b> that reaches the waste (acute basement construction scenario) would receive a maximum acute dose of approximately 0. 25 mrem/yr during the 1000 year period of assessment. This dose falls well below the DOE acute dose limit of 500 mrem/yr. Disposal inventory constraints based on the intruder analysis are well above conservative estimates of the OSWDF inventory and, based on intruder disposal limits; about 7 % of the disposal capacity is reached with the estimated OSWDF inventory...|$|R
40|$|In seismically active, densely {{populated}} areas, buildings within a city block interact {{with one another}} during an earthquake. This phenomenon, whereby two adjacent buildings interact with each other through the surrounding soil during an earthquake, is often called structure-soil-structure interaction (SSSI). SSSI effects are less understood than soil-foundation-structure interaction (SFSI) effects. There are a lack of high-quality case histories that clearly show SSSI, which is a key reason that SSSI is less understood than SFSI. SSSI effects can potentially be detrimental and lead to more damage within the soil-foundation-structure system. Accordingly, {{it is important to understand}} when SSSI effects are important, and include them in engineering analysis and design when necessary. This dissertation describes three centrifuge tests designed to simulate SSSI and SFSI case histories. All centrifuge test described within this dissertation were performed at the University of California at Davis Center for Geotechnical Modeling (UCD-CGM). The first test, Centrifuge Test- 1, examined two inelastic moment-resisting frame structures atop a bed of dry, dense sand. One frame structure represented a prototypical three-story moment-resisting frame structure founded on spread footings. The other frame structure represented a prototypical nine-story moment-resisting frame structure founded on a three-story basement. The two structures were located a significant distance apart, and thus, SSSI effects were masked. Accordingly, the purpose of Test- 1 was to examine SFSI effects of inelastic frame structures and to serve as a baseline test (i. e., a control test). The second test, Centrifuge Test- 2, examined the same two structures atop a bed of dry, dense sand. In Test- 2, however, the two structures were located adjacent to each other. Therefore, the purpose of Test- 2 was to examine SSSI effects. By comparing results from Test- 1 with results from Test- 2, insights into SSSI effects were made. The third test, Centrifuge Test- 3, examined three structures atop a bed of dry, dense sand. Two of the structures were identical, and represented prototypical three-store moment-resisting frame structures founded on spread footings. These structures were nearly identical to the three-story structures used during Test- 1 and Test- 2. The third structure was a rigid rocking wall founded on a large mat foundation, which was identified as the transmitter structure. One frame structure, which was identified as the receiver structure, was located adjacent to the transmitter structure. The other frame structure, which was identified as the control structure, was located a significant distance away from the transmitter-receiver pair of structures. The design goal of the transmitter-receiver pair was to maximize interaction between the two structures. By comparing the seismic response of the control structure with the seismic response of the receiver structure, insights into SSSI were made. The earthquake motions employed during the three centrifuge tests described within this dissertation are critically important. A preliminary centrifuge test (Test- 0) was performed after an earthquake motion selection process. The purpose of Test- 0 was to calibrate a suite of earthquake motions that could be used at the UCD-CGM. This dissertation describes an earthquake motion selection and calibration process that future researchers can use to create test-specific earthquake motions for their research projects. Kinematic SFSI and SSSI effects were examined during Test- 1 and Test- 2. Specifically, the earthquake motions recorded in the free-field at the surface, which is the earthquake motion most often used by practicing engineers for dynamic analyses, was compared to the earthquake motion recorded under the <b>basement,</b> in the <b>soil.</b> Because of kinematic interaction effects, which include base slab averaging and embedment effects, the earthquake motion recorded under the basement has smaller amplitude and smaller high-frequency content than the earthquake motion recorded in the free-field at the surface. This is an established observation, and Test- 1 and Test- 2 data corroborate with current kinematic interaction estimation procedures. When comparing the results from Test- 2 with Test- 1, however, it was seen that basement-level earthquake motion differed less from the free-field surface motion during Test- 2. This result indicates that kinematic interaction effects may be masked in urban environments. The seismic responses of the shallowly embedded frame structure footings were also examined during Test- 1, Test- 2, and Test- 3. More specifically, the vertical displacement (settlement and uplift), horizontal displacement (sliding), and rocking were examined. By comparing results from Test- 2 with results from Test- 1, it was seen that the deeply embedded basement "restrains" the adjacent footings. In other words, the adjacent footings displace and rotate less than the footings that are not adjacent to the basement (i. e., the free footings). This asymmetrical footing response leads to additional demands on the superstructure, which may be unacceptable. In addition, the seismically-induced column moments measured above the restrained footings are larger than those measured above the free footings. Therefore, SSSI effects were seen to be potentially detrimental (i. e., lead to more superstructure damage) during Test- 2. During Test- 3, the same footing restraining effect observed in Test- 2 was found to be not as large. However, there is evidence that the transmitter structure affected the seismic response of the adjacent receiver structure. More specifically, as the transmitter structure rocked and settled during the higher-intensity earthquake motions, the adjacent footings of the receiver structure did uplift, and this caused asymmetry in the superstructure. A general observation from Test- 3 is that the seismic footing response of frame structures founded on shallowly-embedded footings is erratic. Future work in this area will examine possible explanations for the observed erratic response...|$|R
