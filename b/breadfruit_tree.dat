As for the sago palm, one tree yields 1,800 cakes, enough to feed a man for a year.|$|E
5|$|While passing near Truk, {{which has}} a {{population}} of 42,000, Typhoon Nina inflicted heavy crop damage on the area. In the capital of Weno, 85% of homes and 50%of government buildings were damaged. There, communication lines were downed and hundreds of people were evacuated. Throughout the atoll, four lives were lost, including a woman and a 14-year-old boy killed by a falling <b>breadfruit</b> <b>tree</b> and an 11-year-old girl died after her leg was struck by a piece of flying metal. One person was reported missing. Over 1,000people were rendered homeless while roughly 1,000homes were damaged. Damaged from the storm ranged from $30–40million (1987USD) and 39were wounded.|$|E
60|$|The {{vessel was}} the celebrated Bounty, {{which had been}} fitted up {{for the express purpose}} of {{proceeding}} to the island of Otaheite, (now named Tahiti), in the Pacific for plants of the <b>breadfruit</b> <b>tree,</b> it being thought desirable to introduce that tree into the West India Islands. We may remark in passing, that the transplantation was afterwards accomplished, though it failed at this time.|$|E

6000|$|... 'We walked about a small wood {{adjoining}} the house, {{through which}} a small fresh-water stream runs. In the wood we saw specimens {{of the various}} trees and shrubs, and flowers of the island, including those already noticed in Mr. Inglis's garden, and the <b>breadfruit</b> <b>tree</b> and sugar-cane, and a beautiful bright flower of scarlet colour, a convolvulus, larger than any I had ever seen elsewhere; also a tree bearing a very beautiful yellow flower.|$|E
60|$|Even {{as he lay}} here, {{under the}} <b>breadfruit</b> <b>tree,</b> an {{intelligence}} that stared across the starry gulfs, so must all the universe {{be exposed to the}} ceaseless scrutiny of innumerable eyes, like his, though grantedly different, with behind them, by the same token, intelligences that questioned and sought the meaning and the construction of the whole. So reasoning, he felt his soul go forth in kinship with that august company, that multitude whose gaze was forever upon the arras of infinity.|$|E
60|$|So {{a litter}} was made, and, borne on the {{shoulders}} of half a dozen of the men, Bassett departed on the last little adventure that was to cap the total adventure, for him, of living. With a body of which he was scarcely aware, for even the pain had been exhausted out of it, and with a bright clear brain that accommodated him to a quiet ecstasy of sheer lucidness of thought, he lay back on the lurching litter and watched the fading of the passing world, beholding for the last time the <b>breadfruit</b> <b>tree</b> before the devil- devil house, the dim day beneath the matted jungle roof, the gloomy gorge between the shouldering mountains, the saddle of raw limestone, and the mesa of black volcanic sand.|$|E

60|$|It {{was after}} the Bounty had taken in the <b>breadfruit</b> <b>trees</b> at Otaheite, and was {{advanced}} a short distance on the homeward voyage, that the events {{we are about to}} narrate occurred.|$|R
60|$|Later, {{after what}} had been to him a terrible journey of miles, when he {{collapsed}} {{in front of the}} devil-devil house {{in the shadow of the}} <b>breadfruit</b> <b>tree,</b> she had shown very lively ideas on the matter of retaining possession of him. Ngurn, whom Bassett was to know afterward as the devil-devil doctor, priest, or medicine man of the village, had wanted his head. Others of the grinning and chattering monkey-men, all as stark of clothes and bestial of appearance as Balatta, had wanted his body for the roasting oven. At that time he had not understood their language, if by LANGUAGE might be dignified the uncouth sounds they made to represent ideas. But Bassett had thoroughly understood the matter of debate, especially when the men pressed and prodded and felt of the flesh of him as if he were so much commodity in a butcher's stall.|$|E
60|$|And Bassett, {{raising his}} hand in signal, bending forward his head as agreed so as to expose cleanly the {{articulation}} to his taut spinal cord, forgot Balatta, who was merely a woman, a woman merely and only and undesired. He knew, without seeing, when the razor- edged hatchet rose in the air behind him. And for that instant, ere the end, there fell upon Bassett {{the shadows of the}} Unknown, a sense of impending marvel of the rending of walls before the imaginable. Almost, when he knew the blow had started and just ere the edge of steel bit the flesh and nerves it seemed that he gazed upon the serene face of the Medusa, Truth--And, simultaneous with the bite of the steel on the onrush of the dark, in a flashing instant of fancy, he saw the vision of his head turning slowly, always turning, in the devil-devil house beside the <b>breadfruit</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E
60|$|But he {{was reading}} the full report which many men had written on the ground. A white man had been there, he learned, {{and a number of}} blacks. Here a black had climbed a coconut tree and cast down the nuts. There a banana tree had been despoiled of its {{clustered}} fruit; and, beyond, it was evident that a similar event had happened to a <b>breadfruit</b> <b>tree.</b> One thing, however, puzzled him--a scent new to him that was neither black man's nor white man's. Had he had the necessary knowledge and the wit of eye-observance, he would have noted that the footprint was smaller than a man's and that the toeprints were different from a Mary's in that they were close together and did not press deeply into the earth. What bothered him in his smelling was his ignorance of talcum powder. Pungent it was in his nostrils, but never, since first he had smelled out the footprints of man, had he encountered such a scent. And with this were combined other and fainter scents that were equally strange to him.|$|E

50|$|On {{returning}} to London in 1780, {{he worked as}} a gardener at Kew Gardens for seven years, before Banks arranged his appointment as botanist to Bligh's voyage to Tahiti to obtain <b>breadfruit</b> <b>trees.</b> Nelson had control of the Great Cabin and 1015 potted <b>breadfruit</b> <b>trees</b> which were intended for the West Indies. He was caught up in the mutiny and, remaining loyal to the captain, was one of the 19 men cast adrift in a small boat. He survived the famous 3800-mile voyage to Timor, but a few days after arriving in Kupang, died of a fever. Bligh would later name Mount Nelson, Tasmania in his honor.|$|R
60|$|Came the {{day when}} all mists and cob-webs dissolved, when he found his brain clear as a bell, and took just {{appraisement}} of his body's weakness. Neither hand nor foot could he lift. So little control of his body did he have, that he was scarcely aware of possessing one. Lightly indeed his flesh sat upon his soul, and his soul, in its briefness of clarity, knew by its very clarity that the black of cessation was near. He knew the end was close; knew that in all truth he had with his eyes beheld the Red One, the messenger between the worlds; {{knew that he would}} never live to carry that message to the world--that message, for aught to the contrary, which might already have waited man's hearing in the heart of Guadalcanal for ten thousand years. And Bassett stirred with resolve, calling Ngurn to him, out under the shade of the <b>breadfruit</b> <b>tree,</b> and with the old devil-devil doctor discussing the terms and arrangements of his last life effort, his final adventure in the quick of the flesh.|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} nights, lying late under the <b>breadfruit</b> <b>tree,</b> Bassett spent long hours {{watching}} the slow {{setting of the}} western stars beyond the black wall of jungle {{where it had been}} thrust back by the clearing for the village. Possessed of more than a cursory knowledge of astronomy, he took a sick man's pleasure in speculating as to the dwellers on the unseen worlds of those incredibly remote suns, to haunt whose houses of light, life came forth, a shy visitant, from the rayless crypts of matter. He could no more apprehend limits to time than bounds to space. No subversive radium speculations had shaken his steady scientific faith in the conservation of energy and the indestructibility of matter. Always and forever must there have been stars. And surely, in that cosmic ferment, all must be comparatively alike, comparatively of the same substance, or substances, save for the freaks of the ferment. All must obey, or compose, the same laws that ran without infraction through the entire experience of man. Therefore, he argued and agreed, must worlds and life be appanages to all the suns as they were appanages to the particular of his own solar system.|$|E
60|$|The slow weeks passed. The nights, by election, Bassett {{spent on}} the ashen floor of the devil-devil house, beneath the ever- swinging, slow-curing heads. His reason for this {{was that it was}} taboo to the lesser sex of woman, and therefore, a refuge for him from Balatta, who grew more persecutingly and perilously loverly as the Southern Cross rode higher in the sky and marked the imminence of her nuptials. His days Bassett spent in a hammock swung under the shade of the great <b>breadfruit</b> <b>tree</b> before the devil-devil house. There were breaks in this programme, when, in the comas of his devastating fever-attacks, he lay for days and nights in the house of heads. Ever he {{struggled}} to combat the fever, to live, to continue to live, to grow strong and stronger against the day when he would be strong enough to dare the grass-lands and the belted jungle beyond, and win to the beach, and to some labour-recruiting, black-birding ketch or schooner, and on to civilization and the men of civilization, to whom he could give news of the message from other worlds that lay, darkly worshipped by beastmen, in the black heart of Guadalcanal's midmost centre.|$|E
60|$|Menalee {{pretended not}} to notice this. After the others had done eating, he {{proposed}} that they should all go a little farther up into the bushes, where, he said, he had left his own wife among some <b>breadfruit</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|R
50|$|Artocarpus odoratissimus, {{also called}} terap,marang, johey oak, green pedalai, madang, tarap, or timadang, is {{a tree in}} the {{mulberry}} and fig family Moraceae.

6000|$|At last we arose {{above the}} vexation of wasps. It {{was a matter}} of altitude, however, rather than of fortitude. All about us lay the jagged back-bones of ranges, {{as far as the eye}} could see, {{thrusting}} their pinnacles into the trade-wind clouds. Under us, from the way we had come, the Snark lay like a tiny toy on the calm water of Taiohae Bay. Ahead we could see the inshore indentation of Comptroller Bay. We dropped down a thousand feet, and Typee lay beneath us. [...] "Had a glimpse of the gardens of paradise been revealed to me I could scarcely have been more ravished with the sight"--so said Melville on the moment of his first view of the valley. He saw a garden. We saw a wilderness. Where were the hundred groves of the <b>breadfruit</b> <b>tree</b> he saw? We saw jungle, nothing but jungle, with the exception of two grass huts and several clumps of cocoanuts breaking the primordial green mantle. Where was the Ti of Mehevi, the bachelors' hall, the palace where women were taboo, and where he ruled with his lesser chieftains, keeping the half-dozen dusty and torpid ancients to remind them of the valorous past? From the swift stream no sounds arose of maids and matrons pounding tapa. And where was the hut that old Narheyo eternally builded? In vain I looked for him perched ninety feet from the ground in some tall cocoanut, taking his morning smoke.|$|E
6000|$|On {{board the}} Bismarck, the {{commodore}} {{shook hands with}} him, {{told him he was}} to be [...] "taken away from all the chiefs with whom he had been accustomed," [...] and had him taken to the wardroom under guard. The next day he was sent to sea in the Adler. There went with him his brother Moli, one Meisake, and one Alualu, half-caste German, to interpret. He was respectfully used; he dined in the stern with the officers, but the boys dined [...] "near where the fire was." [...] They came to a [...] "newly-formed place" [...] in Australia, where the Albatross was lying, and a British ship, which he knew to be a man-of-war [...] "because the officers were nicely dressed and wore epaulettes." [...] Here he was transhipped, [...] "in a boat with a screen," [...] which he supposed was to conceal him from the British ship; and on board the Albatross was sent below and told he must stay there till they had sailed. Later, however, he was allowed to come on deck, where he found they had rigged a screen (perhaps an awning) under which he walked, looking at [...] "the newly-formed settlement," [...] and admiring a big house [...] "where he was sure the governor lived." [...] From Australia, they sailed some time, and reached an anchorage where a consul-general came on board, and where Laupepa was only allowed on deck at night. He could then see the lights of a town with wharves; he supposes Cape Town. Off the Cameroons they anchored or lay-to, far at sea, and sent a boat ashore to see (he supposes) that there was no British man-of-war. It was the next morning before the boat returned, when the Albatross stood in and came to anchor near another German ship. Here Alualu came to him on deck and told him this was the place. [...] "That is an astonishing thing," [...] said he. [...] "I thought I was to go to Germany, I do not know what this means; I do not know what will be the end of it; my heart is troubled." [...] Whereupon Alualu burst into tears. A little after, Laupepa was called below to the captain and the governor. The last addressed him: [...] "This is my own place, a good place, a warm place. My house is not yet finished, but when it is, you shall live in one of my rooms until I can make a house for you." [...] Then he was taken ashore and brought to a tall, iron house. [...] "This house is regulated," [...] said the governor; [...] "there is no fire allowed to burn in it." [...] In one part of this house, weapons of the government were hung up; there was a passage, {{and on the other side}} of the passage, fifty criminals were chained together, two and two, by the ankles. The windows were out of reach; and there was only one door, which was opened at six in the morning and shut again at six at night. All day he had his liberty, went to the Baptist Mission, and walked about viewing the negroes, who were [...] "like the sand on the seashore" [...] for number. At six they were called into the house and shut in for the night without beds or lights. [...] "Although they gave me no light," [...] said he, with a smile, [...] "I could see I was in a prison." [...] Good food was given him: biscuits, [...] "tea made with warm water," [...] beef, etc.; all excellent. Once, in their walks, they spied a <b>breadfruit</b> <b>tree</b> bearing in the garden of an English merchant, ran back to the prison to get a shilling, and came and offered to purchase. [...] "I am not going to sell breadfruit to you people," [...] said the merchant; [...] "come and take what you like." [...] Here Malietoa interrupted himself to say it was the only tree bearing in the Cameroons. [...] "The governor had none, or he would have given it to me." [...] On the passage from the Cameroons to Germany, he had great delight to see the cliffs of England. He saw [...] "the rocks shining in the sun, and three hours later was surprised to find them sunk in the heavens." [...] He saw also wharves and immense buildings; perhaps Dover and its castle. In Hamburg, after breakfast, Mr. Weber, who had now finally [...] "ceased from troubling" [...] Samoa, came on board, and carried him ashore [...] "suitably" [...] in a steam launch to [...] "a large house of the government," [...] where he stayed till noon. At noon Weber told him he was going to [...] "the place where ships are anchored that go to Samoa," [...] and led him to [...] "a very magnificent house, with carriages inside and a wonderful roof of glass"; to wit, the railway station. They were benighted on the train, and then went in [...] "something with a house, drawn by horses, which had windows and many decks"; plainly an omnibus. Here (at Bremen or Bremerhaven, I believe) they stayed some while in [...] "a house of five hundred rooms"; then were got on board the Nürnberg (as they understood) for Samoa, anchored in England on a Sunday, were joined en route by the famous Dr. Knappe, passed through [...] "a narrow passage where they went very slow and which was just like a river," [...] and beheld with exhilarated curiosity that Red Sea of which they had learned so much in their Bibles. At last, [...] "at the hour when the fires burn red," [...] they came to a place where was a German man-of-war. Laupepa was called, with one of the boys, on deck, when he found a German officer awaiting him, and a steam launch alongside, and was told he must now leave his brother and go elsewhere. [...] "I cannot go like this," [...] he cried. [...] "You must let me see my brother and the other old men"--a term of courtesy. Knappe, who seems always to have been good-natured, revised his orders, and consented not only to an interview, but to allow Moli to continue to accompany the king. So these two were carried to the man-of-war, and sailed many a day, still supposing themselves bound for Samoa; and lo! she came to a country the like of which they had never dreamed of, and cast anchor in the great lagoon of Jaluit; and upon that narrow land the exiles were set on shore. This was the part of his captivity on which he looked back with the most bitterness. It was the last, for one thing, and he was worn down with the long suspense, and terror, and deception. He could not bear the brackish water; and though [...] "the Germans were still good to him, and gave him beef and biscuit and tea," [...] he suffered from the lack of vegetable food.|$|E
