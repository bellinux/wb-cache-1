5|$|Rainbands spawned {{near and}} ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which {{are able to}} produce tornadoes. Rainbands {{associated}} with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the front's orientation due {{to the formation of}} a low-level barrier jet. Bands of thunderstorms can form with sea <b>breeze</b> <b>and</b> land breeze boundaries, if enough moisture is present. If sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front, they can mask the location of the cold front itself.|$|E

5|$|The typical summer {{weather pattern}} is for heat-produced thermals, powered {{by either the}} Gulf or Atlantic sea <b>breeze</b> (<b>and</b> {{occasionally}} both simultaneously), to build puffy white cumulus clouds into threatening thunderheads over {{the interior of the}} Florida peninsula. Usually, the resulting storms drift slowly westward to the bay area, though they may rain themselves out before reaching Tampa if the easterly winds are light or the sea breeze from the Gulf of Mexico is too strong. Occasionally, the storms survive to move out over the Gulf of Mexico, where they can be seen at night from the beaches as spectacular light shows. Nighttime storms offshore are driven by the land-breeze front which is the dermal counterpart of the daytime sea-breeze front.|$|E
5|$|While sailing {{in these}} latitudes on one very dark night, the sea {{presented}} a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle. There was a fresh <b>breeze,</b> <b>and</b> {{every part of}} the surface, which during the day is seen as foam, now glowed with a pale light. The vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in her wake she was followed by a milky train. As far as the eye reached, the crest of every wave was bright, and the sky above the horizon, from the reflected glare of these livid flames, was not so utterly obscure, as over the rest of the heavens.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Gordon Pym {{was born}} {{on the island of}} Nantucket, famous for its fishing harbor and whaling. His best friend, Augustus Barnard, is the son of the captain of a whaling ship. One night, the two boys become drunk and decide, on Augustus's whim, to take {{advantage}} of the <b>breeze</b> <b>and</b> sail out on Pym's sailboat, the Ariel. The breeze, however, turns out to be the beginnings of a violent storm. The situation gets critical when Augustus passes out drunk, and the inexperienced Pym must take control of the dinghy. The Ariel is overtaken by the Penguin, a returning whaling ship. Against the captain's wishes, the crew of the Penguin turns back to search for and rescue both Augustus and Pym. After they are safely back on land, they decide to keep this episode a secret from their parents.|$|E

5|$|Cold fronts feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, {{and may be}} preceded by squall lines and dry lines. Cold fronts are sharper surface boundaries with more significant horizontal wind shear than warm fronts. When a front becomes stationary, it can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind speed, known as a shear line, though the wind direction across the front normally remains constant. In the tropics, tropical waves move {{from east to west}} across the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins. Directional and speed shear can occur across the axis of stronger tropical waves, as northerly winds precede the wave axis and southeast winds are seen behind the wave axis. Horizontal wind shear can also occur along local land <b>breeze</b> <b>and</b> sea breeze boundaries.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} England's opening pair {{did not result}} in an {{improvement}} on the scoreboard. A run out was narrowly avoided following a mix-up on the first ball, and Cyril Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that offered early assistance to the bowlers. The Australians themselves started with Ray Lindwall and Bill Johnston taking the new ball, but Bradman had misjudged the <b>breeze</b> <b>and</b> had to swap his bowlers' ends. For this purpose, Loxton bowled a solitary over. He was erratic in his length and bowled three long hops outside leg stump at the debutant Emmett, who ignored the opportunity to attack and let the balls pass. At the other end, Washbrook also played watchfully and avoided any horizontal bat shots, apart from a missed cut against Johnston's bowling. Overall however, the English openers appeared comfortable in the first half hour of play.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{entertaining}} {{old friends}} {{who came to}} visit her in her home, Cameron also met with younger occultists, such as the Thelemite William <b>Breeze</b> <b>and</b> the industrial musician Genesis P-Orridge. Cameron aided Breeze in co-editing a collection of Parsons' occult and libertarian writings, which were published as Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword in 1989. Cameron was acquainted with the experimental film-maker Chick Strand and appeared in the latter's 1979 project Loose Ends, during which she narrated {{the story of an}} exorcism. In 1989, an exhibition of her work titled The Pearl of Reprisal was held at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery. It included a selection of her paintings and a screening of Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome and The Wormwood Star, while Cameron attended to provide a candle-lit reading of her poetry. In the mid-1990s, Cameron was diagnosed with a brain tumor and underwent radiotherapy treatment, which she supplemented with alternative medicines. The tumor was cancerous and metastasized to her lungs. She {{died at the age of}} 73 in the VA Medical Center on July 24, 1995, and underwent the Thelemic last rites, carried out by a high priestess of the Ordo Templi Orientis. Her body was cremated and its ashes were scattered in the Mojave Desert. A memorial event was held at Venice's Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center in August.|$|E

5|$|Australia and England {{reassembled}} at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Following his unbeaten 159 in {{the previous}} match and Brown's struggles when playing in the middle-order, Loxton took Brown's position. Brown had scored 25, 26, 17, 24 and 32 in the middle-order in the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and the first two Tests. As fast bowling all rounder Keith Miller had been struggling with a back injury that prevented him from bowling from time to time, Loxton {{was seen as a}} necessary reinforcement for the frontline bowlers. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, and Loxton bowled first change, sending down seven overs for the loss of 18 runs. The Australians themselves opened with Ray Lindwall and Bill Johnston taking the new ball, but Bradman had misjudged the <b>breeze</b> <b>and</b> needed to swap his bowlers' ends. For this purpose, Loxton bowled a solitary over, his first in Ashes cricket. He was erratic in his length and bowled three long hops outside leg stump at the debutant George Emmett, who ignored the opportunity to attack and let the balls pass.|$|E
25|$|Tilman {{continued}} his adventures {{in two other}} Bristol Channel pilot cutters, Sea <b>Breeze</b> <b>and</b> Baroque.

25|$|The unit's members {{frequently}} use code {{names such}} as Snake Doctor, Dirt Diver, Betty Blue, Cool <b>Breeze,</b> <b>and</b> Hammer Head, as well as colors (Mr. White, Green, Blue, Black). These are usually used when working directly with American civilians, other English speakers not trained for emergencies, or on counterterrorism missions. According to Jonas Blane, the order of precedence for his team after he is disabled, is, from top to bottom: Mack Gerhardt, Charles Grey, Hector Williams, and Bob Brown based on seniority.|$|E
25|$|On 1 November 1931, after {{a number}} of delays, Oldenburg was renamed SuomenJoutsen (Swan of Finland) after Finska Svan, a Swedish 16th century warship that took part in the naval action of 7July1565 between Sweden and Denmark. After launching, SuomenJoutsen broke her {{moorings}} in the strong <b>breeze</b> <b>and</b> damaged two ships, gunboat Karjala and Osmo, a laid-up full rigged ship built in 1869, before she was brought under control. On 4 November 1931, she left the shipyard for Helsinki, under tow and escorted by minelayer M-1.|$|E
25|$|On {{the fourth}} {{anniversary of the}} bombings Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall {{unveiled}} a memorial in London, {{at the rear of}} the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Main Building, facing St. James's Park.

The gods gave him Álfheimr, the realm of the Elves, as a teething present. He rides the shining dwarf-made boar Gullinbursti and possesses the ship Skíðblaðnir which always has a favorable <b>breeze</b> <b>and</b> can be folded together and carried in a pouch when it is not being used. He has the servants Skírnir, Byggvir and Beyla.|$|E
25|$|India {{began the}} day hoping {{to dismiss the}} Australian lower order quickly. A breeze had picked up speed through the ground and those bowling from the Paddington End had the {{advantage}} of running in with the <b>breeze</b> <b>and</b> bowling faster. However, Lee continued to resist, reaching 50 from 100 balls in the 98th over. Lee eventually fell five overs later for 59, leaving Australia at 8/421. Mitchell Johnson made a quick 28 from 29 balls before falling to Kumble, Stuart Clark fell two overs later and Australia were all out for 463.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the filming}} {{took place in}} the real sewers near the Han River, rather than on a set. The stars and crew were inoculated against tetanus by the medical officer. During filming, the crew {{had to deal with the}} effects of changes in weather and ambient temperature. This {{including}} the sewage water freezing in cold temperatures, so that it had to be broken up and melted; and during hot and windy periods, the water evaporated and the silt turned to dust, which blew around in the <b>breeze</b> <b>and</b> into the faces of the crew.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to this, {{there are also}} risks of late frosts and hailstones in spring, excessive heat in summer, and violent storms caused by the mixture of the sea <b>breezes</b> <b>and</b> the dry air of the Castilian plain.|$|R
