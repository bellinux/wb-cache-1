500|$|Heading {{into the}} 1000m final, Ohno {{had won the}} overall silver medal for the 1000m during the 2009–10 World Cup by {{competing}} {{in three of the}} four competitions during the season. [...] During the finals of the 1000m, Ohno finished in third place, making a comeback from a slip with less than three laps remaining. [...] With the bronze medal win, he became the most decorated American athlete ever at the Winter Games with seven career medals. [...] Bonnie Blair, the former record holder, said she was happy for his accomplishment, adding: [...] "It's a great feat for him, U.S. speedskating, and the United States of America.

500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN said he {{was happy}} with the new, {{unpredictable}} direction The Office was taking. He particularly praised the Michael/Pam relationship in the episode, as well as soccer subplot involving Jim and Charles {{and the return of}} Ryan; he said Ryan's new bleached blond hair and his theft of bowling shoes were particularly funny moments. Will Leitch of New York magazine said the episode has provided a change the show needed, and said, [...] "Considering how unlikely it was that The Office was going to allow Michael and Pam to degrade into homelessness and squalor, the show has handled the predictable transition as well as possible." [...] Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said the episode included a good exploration of Michael and Pam's relationship; he said [...] "they're weirdly good together". Phipps, who gave the episode an A- grade, also said the Dunder Mifflin material worked well, [...] "although Idris Elba has <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> at portraying a heartless professional it almost doesn’t seem right for anything to break through his icy exterior." ...|$|E

500|$|BuzzFeed {{reported}} that 23 18-wheeler trucks arrived at each venue at 5 a.m. on show day. It took 7 hours to unload {{and build the}} stage. Unlike most tours who built the stage from the bottom up, the stage was built from the ceiling down. The tour comprised 140 workers, 125 crew members, 14 tour buses, 16 dancers and 2 band members. In July 2011, Spears told MTV News she was having [...] "a blast" [...] on the tour, commenting, [...] "The shows have been equally amazing.

500|$|In {{the end of}} July, RKO {{approved}} the film and Welles was allowed to officially begin shooting, despite having already been filming [...] "tests" [...] for several weeks. Welles leaked stories to newspaper reporters that the tests had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> {{that there was no}} need to re-shoot them. The first official scene to be shot was the breakfast montage sequence between Kane and his first wife Emily. To strategically save money and appease the RKO executives who opposed him, Welles rehearsed scenes extensively before actually shooting and filmed very few takes of each shot set-up. Welles never shot master shots for any scene after Toland told him that Ford never shot them. To appease the increasingly curious press, Welles threw a cocktail party for selected reporters, promising that they could watch a scene being filmed. When the journalists arrived Welles told them they had [...] "just finished" [...] shooting for the day but still had the party. Welles told the press that he was ahead of schedule (without factoring in the month of [...] "test shooting"), thus discrediting claims that after a year in Hollywood without making a film he was a failure in the film industry.|$|E
500|$|Veronica Mars has {{attracted}} a loyal and dedicated fan base. A group of fans calling themselves the [...] "Cloud Watchers" [...] organized several campaigns to bring more viewers to the series to ensure its continuation. The group hired a plane to fly over the CW offices, carrying a banner reading [...] "Renew Veronica Mars". The group hired street teams in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Chicago to distribute 30,000 fliers advertising the series' return after its midseason hiatus in the third season. The [...] "Cloud Watchers" [...] raised $50,000 in donations and through the sale of Veronica Mars clothing and tchotchkes. Upon the cancellation of the series, fans sent more than 10,000 Mars Bars to the CW, hoping that the network would reverse its decision and renew the series. Rob Thomas thanked the fans of the series for their efforts, saying [...] "I love those people and they have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> to me, but it's not going to happen." [...] A feature film continuation was made possible in 2013 through a Kickstarter fund, in which 91,585 fans donated $5,702,153 to get the film made. Fans have also come to refer to themselves and {{be referred to as}} [...] "Marshmallows" [...] by media as well as the cast and crew of the series after a line delivered by Wallace (Percy Daggs III) in the pilot episode: [...] "You're a marshmallow, Veronica Mars. A Twinkie." [...] At the end of the same episode, Veronica in voiceover remarks [...] "Well, you know what they say: 'Veronica Mars, she's a marshmallow.'" [...] A reference to the term was also included in the fan-funded film.|$|E
