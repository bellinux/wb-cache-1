Courts later held that the (Riegle-Neal) act gave the OCC the ability to apply state laws even if they were not prohibited.|$|E

5000|$|The free banking {{reforms were}} seen {{as a part of}} a greater {{struggle}} for liberty and hence much was expected from them. Free banking replaced special interest legislation with a systematic [...] "rule of law," [...] in a form of highly idiosyncratic, flexible, personalized charter conditions. It was expected that the elimination of the privilege associated with the Safety Fund System 1929 would decrease legislative corruption and log rolling, the number of banks would increase and they would be more rationally located, and the end effect of more available credit would encourage commercial and manufacturing businesses.A bulk of evidence suggests that the free banking laws indeed helped the growth of the number of banks. In 1800, there were only 25 banks in the United States and this number grew to 1,364 in 1860. The <b>bank</b> <b>expansion</b> varied significantly across the states; for example New York and Pennsylvania had 4 and 2 banks in 1800, and this number grew to 299 and 80 in 1860 respectively. Although the economic development in some areas might have had some influence on the discrepancies, the difference was most likely caused by different chartered policies in each state that controlled the reserve requirements, interest rates for loans and deposits, the necessary capital ratio etc. Many banks, however, failed to survive the period and provide a stable source of banking services, and a safe currency. In Minnesota, for example, between 1852 and 1854, 57 banks or eighty percent of the state's financial institutions, ceased operation.|$|E
5000|$|The World Bank {{found in}} 2009 that Israeli {{settlements}} in the West Bank (which amount to 15% {{of the population of}} the West Bank) are given access to over 80% of its fresh water resources, despite the fact that the Oslo accords call for [...] "joint" [...] management of such resources. This has created, according to the Bank, [...] "real water shortages" [...] for the Palestinians. In January 2012, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French parliament published a report describing Israel's water policies in the West Bank as [...] "a weapon serving the new apartheid". The report noted that the 450,000 Israeli settlers used more water than the 2.3 million Palestinians, [...] "in contravention of international law", that Palestinians are not allowed to use the underground aquifers, and that Israel was deliberately destroying wells, reservoirs and water purification plants. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said the report was [...] "loaded with the language of vicious propaganda, far removed from any professional criticism with which one could argue intelligently". A report by the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies concludes that Israel has fulfilled the water agreements it has made with the Palestinians, and the author has commented that the situation is [...] "just the opposite of apartheid" [...] as Israel has provided water infrastructure to more than 700 Palestinian villages.The Association for Civil Rights in Israel concluded in 2008 that a segregated road network in the West <b>Bank,</b> <b>expansion</b> of Jewish settlements, restriction of the growth of Palestinian towns and discriminatory granting of services, budgets and access to natural resources are [...] "a blatant violation of the principle of equality and in many ways reminiscent of the Apartheid regime in South Africa". The group reversed its previous reluctance to use the comparison to South Africa because [...] "things are getting worse rather than better", according to spokeswoman Melanie Takefman.|$|E

In this note it is shown that the social banking policies have not simultaneously decreased the rural poverty gap. This suggests a potential trade-off for policy makers, hinted at by earlier theoretical modeling: while opening new bank branches in “unbanked locations”might lift some people out of poverty, it may increase the depth of poverty of others. The result also illustrates the value added of combining complementary poverty measures to achieve a more complete picture of the impact of policies on livelihoods...|$|E

We use a self-constructed database (1990 - 2011) of financial cooperatives in 55 developing countries. Our empirical results are threefold. First, financial cooperatives tend to reach more members in countries where the commercial banking sector is weak. This validates their role as a market failure solution. Second, {{in the process of}} commercial <b>bank</b> <b>expansion,</b> financial cooperatives run the risk of being crowded out. Third, financial cooperatives seem to benefit from some kind of bank presence, especially as far as savings mobilization is concerned. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

Another is that competition from home country banks had a significantly negative effect on foreign banks’ asset volumes...|$|E

We find that operating costs and loan losses decrease sharply after states permit statewide branching and, {{to a lesser}} extent, after states allow interstate banking. The improvements following branching deregulation appear to occur because better banks grow {{at the expense of}} their less-efficient rivals. By retarding the "natural" evolution of the industry, branching restrictions reduce the performance of the average banking asset. We also find that most of the reduction in banks' costs are passed along to bank borrowers in the form of lower loan rates. Bank competition; Banking law; Branch banks; Interstate banking...|$|E

The bank failure rate {{was found to be}} an increasing function of the unemployment rate, the average cost of funds, volatility of the S&P 500 Stock Index, and charge-offs as a percentage of outstanding loans and a decreasing function of the mortgage rate on new 30 -year fixed-rate mortgages. The evidence implies also that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act acted to reduce bank failures whereas the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking Act of 1994 may inadvertently have (by increasing competition and/or increasing costs through branch <b>bank</b> <b>expansion)</b> induced increased bank failures. ...|$|E

Because existing theories of diversification, competition and bank risk taking are unable to explain this finding, I propose an explanation by showing that a bank’s organizational structure affects not only its risk taking behavior, but also the risk taking of competing banks. The model further provides additional hypotheses, which I test empirically using two identification strategies and data from U. S. commercial banks. My findings support the hypothesized relationship between organizational structure and risk, and show that a bank’s geographic diversification affects the risk taking behavior of competing banks...|$|E
