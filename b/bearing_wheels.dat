In the 1930s the introduction of practical locomotive haulage in coal mines demanded better wagons than the traditional plain bearing designs. Hudson introduced new designs with pressed steel corrugated bodies with roller <b>bearing</b> <b>wheels.</b> This style of vehicle was ultimately adopted by the National Coal Board as its standard coal haulage vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Tech Deck makes {{hard plastic}} also wooden skateboards and borrows designs from many {{well-known}} skateboard manufacturers, such as Blind, Flip, and Element. They use grip tape, and professional graphics. The stock trucks on Tech Decks {{are made of}} die-cast metal and have two separate axles for the wheels to roll on. The wheels are made out of plastic along with the bushings. Some fingerboarders prefer the feel and performance of decks made from wood. Wooden decks {{can be made from}} 3-7 plies of a given veneer; maple, walnut, and mahogany being the most popular. All of the hole-drilling and shaping is done by hand or {{with the aid of a}} machine, thus the price is higher. A wooden deck from a popular company can have a low to high price range usually depending on the quality of the deck one is to purchase, prices range from 10 - $52 USD. Wooden fingerboard makers are now offering custom designs; the buyer can choose from their line of graphics or send in their own. The wooden boards come in a variety of widths from 26 - 32 mm and concave can vary greatly from maker to maker. Some companies offer even more customization options such as the choosing of the plies used to go into the deck, as well as the width/length of the deck. Along with wooden decks, advanced fingerboarder's also tend to prefer <b>bearing</b> <b>wheels</b> to plastic. <b>Bearing</b> <b>wheels</b> can be made from a range of materials such as teflon, urethane, silicon, fiberglass, and even clay. The wheels are usually put into a lathe to ensure the best shape. Once the wheels have been readied, bearings are put into place to increase the smoothness of the wheels rolling on the axle. Tuning screws for the wheels cause the wheels to roll more smoothly. Rather than using the stock axles and kingpins that come on Tech Deck trucks, some more advanced fingerboards use tuning screws, softer 'foam griptape' and custom kingpins to ensure that wheels and hangars are more properly secured. Example: Blackriver Trucks and YTrucks. Board rails can be added to the deck bottom similar to those used on a standard skateboard. Fingerboards made with plastic are sometimes modified by heating the plastic to shape it such as making the kicks higher or adding concavity.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{high density}} {{polyurethane}} or plastic wheels between 40 and 47mm, replacing the inner two wheels. The name {{is derived from}} the nature of flat(rocker) setups to [...] "rock" [...] (become unstable) over concave or convex surfaces. Eliminating the center wheels eliminates the instability by reducing the number of contact points the skate has with the ground. Having only two wheels on a frame ensures that any weight on that skate will be distributed 50/50, front to back. Some skaters prefer replacing only one of the inner wheels with anti-rockers (called tri-rocker).Anti-rocker wheels enable skaters to grind obstacles with a relatively high diameter. These wheels unlike [...] "normal" [...] (larger, softer) wheels, give skaters the ability to approach obstacles in ways they {{might not be able to}} otherwise. This depends on boot dimensions/style, frame dimensions/style and skater dimensions/style. While larger wheels leave less of a gap between them, the smaller anti-rocker wheels bring the surface of the edge being grided closer to the frame. At the same time the added space between the center wheels, allows for the entire skate to be angled farther forward for a more centered position over the edge. The lower coefficient of friction slides faster than that of a softer wheel, so it may unobstructively rest on the horrozontal surface(s) of the obstacle, allowing for the afore mentioned angle/position of the boot/skater while grinding. This is an angle that may be impossible to achieve with certain frame/flat(rocker) combinations on certain obstacles. An anti-rocker setup would be used at the skaters discretion, based on the terrain they planned to skate, and way they wish to skate it. One disadvantage of an anti-rocker setup is the speed that is lost, as four load <b>bearing</b> <b>wheels</b> are removed, and the weight distributed to each of the remaining is increased.|$|E

50|$|In 1974, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in {{collaboration}} with the Swiss watch industry standards organization NIHS: Normes de l'Industrie Horlog√®re Suisse published a standard, ISO 1112, which prohibited manufacturers from including such nonfunctional jewels in the jewel counts in advertising and sales literature. This put a stop to the use of totally nonfunctional jewels. However, some experts say manufacturers have continued to inflate the jewel count of their watches by 'upjeweling'; adding functional jeweled <b>bearings</b> to <b>wheels</b> that do not really need them, exploiting loopholes in ISO 1112. Examples given include adding capstones to third and fourth <b>wheel</b> <b>bearings,</b> jeweling minute <b>wheel</b> <b>bearings,</b> and automatic winding ratchet pawls. Arguably none of these additions adds to the accuracy or longevity of the watch.|$|R

40|$|To {{promote the}} birdlife in grazelands and {{increase}} the multiplicity {{of plants and animals}} in flooded meadows (used for harvesting fodder) there is call for a continued cultivation of these areas. For many years these areas were harvested manually, or grazed by cattle from farms located nearby. Due to the rationalization in farming has the cultivation of flooded meadows diminished in extent. These meadows are unique with their plants and animal life and characterized by the annual flooding with nutritious water from local lakes and water-courses. To maintain the cultivation by the use of grazing animals would the livestock of the local region have to be increased a lot. Since this option isn't feasible today, there's an enhanced need for mechanization of cultivation practices at flooded meadows. As the cultivation of flooded meadows has been discontinued will the shores be choked with tall-growing species which means that the amount of biomass increases. This results in a soil with a reduced oxygen content which leads to a slower decomposition of plant remnants. The process elevates the ground and causes overgrowing into much the same as mainland vegetation. Birds of flooded meadows needs low vegetation and distances of at least 100 meters to the nearest bushes or trees. Plant remnants needs to be taken away otherwise it will become a disturbing element for these birds. These meadows will thereby turn into a beneficial environment for nesting and feedseeking birds. The experiences from cultivation of flooded meadows in our country are of various kinds. From conventional ley harvest methods practised in the south to the management of wetland cultivation up north. New methods have been tried out here and there, using for example special constructed machinery or applied military training with crawler type vehicles. These measures can be used for the actual work of putting flooded meadows in order. An essential problem is the carrying capacity for this kind of soil. Therefore considerable requirements are made upon the bearing parts of the used vehicles. To reduce the pressure from beneath the wheels needs the load either be decreased or the carrying surface be increased. The <b>bearing</b> <b>wheels</b> sinks until the surface of support becomes as large, as the pressure on its surface becomes equal with the carrying capacity. Resistance to taxiing comes of tracking and calls for extra energy. To avoid this effect it is better to increase the diameter of the wheels than of the width of the tyres. When the carrying capacity is crucial it is no more than the connected surface layer that gives it any support. At passage across the field becomes the surface of the soil exposed to shearing. The shearing can be decreased through an additional number of wheels or having the machines equipped with crawlers. On soils like these it is the axial weight that influences the carrying capacity. Alternative methods to put fields like these in order is to mill off soil, burn off vegetation or to use a pasture trimmer. Special purpose machines are nowadays under testing. These machines are manufactured by the companies LVR AB and NOVASS AB. Another of these machines is being developed and tested privately by Jossi Kyllenen. There are different kinds of mowers and one of these is the knife mower which is low in weight, power efficient and shears the grass but sensitive towards strange objects lying in the way of its course. Another is the rotary mower that is more dependable in service and works through a combination of shearing and striking. The latter one has a higher capacity but requires an increased engine effect and weight of the tractor. There is also the flail forage harvester that strikes off the grass with flails and transports the material directly to a carriage. The machine can on the other hand pick up pieces of soil and gravel together with the harvested material. Dry soils can be cultivated with conventional ley machines while wet soils sometimes just allow one or two passages across at maximum. The later condition requires direct loading into a collector trailer, alternatively with the mower aggregate mounted {{in the front of the}} tractor. When harvesting hey it's often necessary to turnover the material at least once. For the purpose of harvest are various balers and self-loading trailers obtainable. Balers are usually heavy while self-loading trailers can be found in many sizes and often equipped with bogie. They are also flexible as they can carry small loads on quite wet soils. Transport of the harvested material can be done through two different systems. Either directly to final disposal or through transhipment at the roadside of fields. When distances of transport are less than 30 to 40 kilometers transport by tractor can be considered as less expensive than transport by truck. Round bales and rectangular big bales are easy to load and transport on open-sided trailers. The trailers can take a full load with a relatively good utilization of the loading capacity of the carriage. Because of their weight these bales must be loaded on carriages by machine. Using small bales is another beneficial alternative, but these bales need to be heaped up during long-distance transport which requires extra labour to a certain extent. Harvested material that is not baled can either be transported with a self-loading trailer or a truck carrying containers. The self-loading trailer is good at shorter distances of transport but less suitable for transhipment. The removed material can be deposited in the following ways: ‚Ä¢ Forage to livestock. The forage can be of special value if classified as KRAV-approved feed. It can also become horse-feed to a certain extent. ‚Ä¢ Green manuring of arable land. The material needs in this case to be chopped. Material with nitrogen deficiency can tie itself to the nitrogen of the soil in connection with the decomposition. The nitrogen dissolves itself when the process of decomposition is concluded. ‚Ä¢ Soil at vegetable production. The material should be chopped and the method can result in positive effects upon noxious insects, weed, soil moisture and soil structure. ‚Ä¢ Composting. Fresh material should be mixed with other substances. Two alternatives are: 1. Windrow composting has many disadvantages and is not recommended. 2. Compost blended with parkwastes has more advantages than drawbacks. ‚Ä¢ Retting. In the process of retting biogas is produced. Research is in progress and several interesting byproducts can be extracted, as for example forage. The condition is an existing and suitable plant for biogas production located nearby. ‚Ä¢ Incineration. It requires particular furnaces with certain properties of combustion. ‚Ä¢ Landfill. The material is not suitable for established municipal set-ups and the initial cost for new set-ups can be extensive. Not recommended. Other important issues to take into consideration: ‚Ä¢ How is the nutrient and energy content of the green forage utilized? ‚Ä¢ Is there any economic value in the green forage? ‚Ä¢ How can transportation work be minimized? ‚Ä¢ Which resources and possibilities are available? Finally, from a general point of view it is nearly impossible to decide which machinery that is most suitable for a particular type of soil or the cost of cultivation of flooded meadows. The conditions varies a lot between the regions, which means that many aspects needs to be taken into account for in each case...|$|E
