5|$|The Android {{operating}} system was officially unveiled in November 2007 {{along with the}} founding of the Open Handset Alliance (OHA); a consortium of hardware, software, and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices. These companies included Google, along with HTC, a company who was at the time, one of the largest manufacturers of phones. While Google indicated in 2008 that several linux devices were <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> preparation for the official public launch of Android, only one was to be released in the United States that year—the HTC Dream. Plans called for the Dream to be released on T-Mobile USA {{by the end of the}} year (with some reports suggesting October 2008), targeting the holiday shopping season. Sprint had worked with the OHA, but had not yet unveiled any plans to release an Android phone of its own, while Verizon Wireless and AT did not have any plans for Android devices yet at all.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, Chevrolet had {{announced}} a launch {{for the second}} generation Cruze in late 2015, after originally being scheduled to debut in late 2014. The delay is reportedly caused by engineering modifications. The model had been spotted covered in camouflage while <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> February, and October 2013. Its supposed interior was also spotted, while graphical renders were presented by the Carscoops website. The model will be slightly longer than the first generation.|$|E

25|$|The Bell Telephone Laboratories made a producible version {{from the}} {{magnetron}} delivered to America by the Tizard Mission, {{and before the}} end of 1940, the Radiation Laboratory had been set up {{on the campus of the}} Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop various types of radar using the magnetron. By early 1941, portable centimetric airborne radars were <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> American and British aircraft. In late 1941, the Telecommunications Research Establishment in Great Britain used the magnetron to develop a revolutionary airborne, ground-mapping radar codenamed H2S. The H2S radar was in part developed by Alan Blumlein and Bernard Lovell.|$|E
25|$|PARP inhibitors {{have also}} shown promise in early trials, {{particularly}} {{in people with}} BRCA gene mutations, since the BRCA protein interacts with the PARP pathway. It is also being studied in recurrent ovarian cancer in general, where preliminary studies have shown longer PFS. Specifically, olaparib has shown greater survival compared to doxorubicin, though this treatment is still being investigated. It is not clear yet which biomarkers are predictive of responsiveness to PARP inhibitors. Rucaparib is another PARP inhibitor being researched in BRCA-positive and BRCA-negative recurrent advanced ovarian cancer. Niraparib is a PARP inhibitor <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> BRCA-positive recurrent ovarian cancer.|$|E

25|$|The D1JP drift {{series has}} been {{prototyping}} and fine-tuning an electronic judging {{system based on}} custom sensors that record and transmit car data to a computer that judges the run. This system is also <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> some European series. It is designed to remove subjectivity and/or predisposition of judges. Usually the track for such a system is broken up into several sections (usually three) and the system automatically generates scores based on speed, angle and fluidity of the driver in each section, combining the scores for the final score. In certain situations judges can change or overrule a score, which happens, though rarely.|$|E
25|$|The BMW i3 has two pedals {{like all}} cars with {{automatic}} transmission. The accelerator pedal acts as both accelerator and engine brake. When the driver releases the pedal, the vehicle's kinetic energy is regenerated by the vehicle drivetrain to recharge the battery. This {{has the effect}} of slowing the car down. During the field testing of the Mini E, which features an accelerator that recharges the battery in this way, and consists of brakes that only apply to the rear wheels, BMW has learned that drivers tend to rely on the engine brake: around 75% of all deceleration maneuvers are initiated without the brake pedal in urban traffic areas. BMW also expected the i3 to use the same type of battery and powertrain that is <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> the BMW ActiveE trials.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{his injury}} {{he did not}} take part in the Invasion of Poland; however, he soon joined the anti-Nazi {{underground}} as part of the ZWZ and AK. He took part in the recovery of the German V2 rockets which were <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> Poland, and their shipment to Great Britain. His unit also took part in several skirmishes with the Germans and other military actions, including the blowing up of the rail bridge on the Siedlce-Czeremha rail line However, as far as it is known, Łukasiuk did not participate in Operation Tempest because the front moved past the region he was operating in. Subsequently a plan was formed to unite all the local AK groupings and march to Warsaw to help in the Warsaw Uprising. Due to arrests and persecution of AK members by the Soviets however, the plan was not realized. After the NKVD carried out arrests and repression against the local population (including the arrest and deportation to the gulags of Władysław's brother-in-law) he decided to join the anti-communist resistance and formed a partisan unit.|$|E

25|$|As it was {{the first}} game on a new console, the {{development}} team was largely made up of people new to the series, including designers Akira Ohtani and Yuki Sakamoto. The capacity of the Wii U meant that more experimentation with graphics could be done. During the making of the game, the team watched a lot of scary online videos, along with studying lighting and the appearance of being wet. Alongside making a game for dedicated series players, they also added adjustments for new players, partly due to the multimedia developments that were underway. Among these changes were adding helpful gameplay features and creating more conversation cutscenes to make the story easier to understand. The pace of gameplay was also made similar to an action game as opposed to previous entries. In addition, the flashback cutscenes were made to look grainy and low-quality compared to the present-day cutscenes. While they had initially been visually similar to rest of the game, part of the series' appeal was the fear evoked by unseen objects, so they added distortions. The shift onto more powerful hardware also enabled the team to incorporate more graphic scenes, which contributed to it receiving a higher CERO rating than previous titles. A mechanic <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> the game was the necessity to keep dry, initially inspired by the sweating mechanic from Dead or Alive 5. While this was toned down, dampness being tied to the character's well being remained in the game as both a story and gameplay concept. This aspect was suggested by Ohtani.|$|E

500|$|Even et al. did not {{describe}} in detail how to implement this algorithm efficiently. They state only that by [...] "using appropriate data structures {{in order to}} find the implications of any decision", each step of the algorithm (other than the backtracking) can be performed quickly. However, some inputs may cause the algorithm to backtrack many times, each time performing many steps before backtracking, so its overall complexity may be nonlinear. To avoid this problem, they modify the algorithm so that, after reaching each choice point, it begins simultaneously testing both of the two assignments for the variable set at the choice point, spending equal numbers of steps on each of the two assignments. As soon as the test for one of these two assignments would create another choice point, the other test is stopped, so that at any stage of the algorithm there are only two branches of the backtracking tree that are still <b>being</b> <b>tested.</b> <b>In</b> this way, the total time spent performing the two tests for any variable is proportional to the number of variables and clauses of the input formula whose values are permanently assigned. As a result, the algorithm takes linear time in total.|$|E
