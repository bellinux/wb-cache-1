5|$|To {{diagnose}} osteochondritis dissecans, an X-ray, CT scan or MRI scan can {{be performed}} to show necrosis of subchondral <b>bone,</b> <b>formation</b> of loose fragments, or both. Occasionally a nuclear medicine bone scan is {{used to assess the}} degree of loosening within the joint.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is {{the fifth}} most {{abundant}} element {{in the human body}} and the most abundant metal. Calcium ions {{play a vital role in}} the physiology and biochemistry of organisms and the cell as electrolytes. They play an important role in signal transduction pathways, where they act as a second messenger, in neurotransmitter release from neurons, in contraction of all muscle cell types, and in fertilization. Many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor. Calcium ions outside cells are also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper <b>bone</b> <b>formation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is useful for}} staging OCD lesions, evaluating {{the integrity of the}} joint surface, and distinguishing normal variants of <b>bone</b> <b>formation</b> from OCD by showing bone and cartilage edema {{in the area of the}} irregularity. MRI provides information regarding features of the articular cartilage and bone under the cartilage, including edema, fractures, fluid interfaces, articular surface integrity, and fragment displacement. A low T1 and high T2 signal at the fragment interface is seen in active lesions. This indicates an unstable lesion or recent microfractures. While MRI and arthroscopy have a close correlation, X-ray films tend to be less inductive of similar MRI results.|$|E
30|$|When {{conservative}} treatment fails, {{surgery is}} indicated. Many different surgical techniques {{have been described}} such as extirpation of the retrocalcaneal bursa and a resection of the upper calcaneus (Wiegerinck et al. 2013) and detachment of the Achilles tendon at its insertion followed by removal of intra-tendinous <b>bone</b> <b>formations</b> and calcifications. For intra-tendinous <b>bone</b> <b>formations</b> and calcifications, most surgical methods described include tendon invasive procedures and require long postoperative rehabilitation periods. There is no consensus regarding the most efficient surgical treatment for insertional Achilles tendinopathy (Wiegerinck et al. 2013).|$|R

5|$|The {{alveolar}} bone is the bone of the jaw which forms the alveolus around teeth. Like any other bone {{in the human}} body, {{alveolar bone}} is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area of bone under compressive force from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has {{a high number of}} osteoblasts, resulting in <b>bone</b> <b>formation.</b>|$|E

25|$|Bone is not static. It is {{constantly}} being reabsorbed and created. Osteoporosis results when <b>bone</b> <b>formation</b> occurs {{at a rate}} less than bone resorption.|$|E
25|$|Bone {{volume is}} {{determined}} by the rates of <b>bone</b> <b>formation</b> and bone resorption. Recent research has suggested that certain growth factors may work to locally alter <b>bone</b> <b>formation</b> by increasing osteoblast activity. Numerous bone-derived growth factors have been isolated and classified via bone cultures. These factors include insulin-like growth factors I and II, transforming growth factor-beta, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and bone morphogenetic proteins. Evidence suggests that bone cells produce growth factors for extracellular storage in the bone matrix. The release of these growth factors from the bone matrix could cause the proliferation of osteoblast precursors. Essentially, bone growth factors may act as potential determinants of local <b>bone</b> <b>formation.</b> Research has suggested that cancellous bone volume in postemenopausal osteoporosis may be determined by the relationship between the total bone forming surface and the percent of surface resorption.|$|E

25|$|Cortisol reduces <b>bone</b> <b>formation,</b> favoring {{long-term}} {{development of}} osteoporosis (progressive bone disease). It transports potassium {{out of cells}} in exchange for {{an equal number of}} sodium ions (see above). This can trigger the hyperkalemia of metabolic shock from surgery. Cortisol also reduces calcium absorption in the intestine.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{glucocorticoid}} levels {{resulting from}} administration {{as a drug}} or hyperadrenocorticism have effects on many systems. Some examples include inhibition of <b>bone</b> <b>formation,</b> suppression of calcium absorption (both of {{which can lead to}} osteoporosis), delayed wound healing, muscle weakness, and increased risk of infection. These observations suggest a multitude of less-dramatic physiologic roles for glucocorticoids.|$|E
25|$|Both estrogens and androgens are {{necessary}} in all humans for bone health.

25|$|Calcium balance—The {{process of}} bone {{resorption}} by the osteoclasts releases stored calcium into the systemic circulation {{and is an}} important process in regulating calcium balance. As <b>bone</b> <b>formation</b> actively fixes circulating calcium in its mineral form, removing it from the bloodstream, resorption actively unfixes it thereby increasing circulating calcium levels. These processes occur in tandem at site-specific locations.|$|E
25|$|TRAP is {{associated}} with osteoclast migration to bone resorption sites, and, once there, TRAP is believed to initiate osteoclast differentiation, activation, and proliferation.

25|$|It is {{produced}} in humans by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex within the adrenal gland. It is released in response to stress and low blood-glucose concentration.

30|$|The {{system used}} in osteosynthesis {{directly}} influences fracture consolidation; depending on its shape and rigidity, osteosyntesis {{is capable of}} modifying <b>bone</b> callus <b>formation.</b> The intramedullary nail is currently the primary treatment for closed diaphyseal fractures and for grade I and II open lesions according to the Gustilo and Anderson classification [1, 2]. This technique safeguards limb length and the soft tissue around the bone fragments. The immediate weight bearing allows gravity to act directly on the fracture site, encouraging <b>bone</b> callus <b>formation.</b>|$|R
30|$|Apart {{from the}} {{pathological}} distal Achilles tendon itself, other tissues {{have been associated}} with insertional pain.

The plantaris tendon could also be potentially associated with this condition (Lintz et al. 2011).|$|R
