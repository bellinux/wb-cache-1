5|$|Utilising the Game Boy Horror, {{players can}} access {{a map of}} the mansion, seeing which rooms they have visited, what doors are open, and which remain locked. When Luigi finds a key during his explorations, the Game Boy Horror {{automatically}} indicates which door it unlocks. In addition to a map function, the device also keeps track of any treasure that Luigi has found - rooms will usually have treasure hidden within, which can be either coins, gems, gold bars and so forth, hidden within items and even in a chest that appears when the ghosts are cleared out, which Luigi can draw out and then suck up with the Poltergust; if a ghost harms Luigi, he will drop a small portion of collected treasure that he will need to recover before it disappears. After Luigi encounters a group of Boos hiding in the mansion, the device can be used to find each one hiding in a room, through a <b>beeper</b> sound and a flashing yellow light on the device, which turns red when Luigi is close to one; Boos can only be located in rooms that have become lit after their ghosts have been cleared out. Boos are trickier to deal with, as they can plant decoys and traps within objects they can hide in that can fool the Horror, and will escape into other rooms if they can, forcing the player to chase after them.|$|E
25|$|Some older systems {{featured}} a simple <b>beeper</b> as their only sound output, {{as the original}} ZX Spectrum and IBM PC; despite this, many skilled programmers were able to produce unexpected rich music with this bare hardware, where the sound is fully generated by the system's CPU by direct control of the <b>beeper.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Beepers</b> or tone-only pagers: <b>Beepers</b> or tone-only pagers are the {{simplest}} and least expensive form of paging. They were named <b>beepers</b> because they originally made a beeping noise, but current pagers in this category use other forms of alert as well. Some use audio signals, others light up and some vibrate, often used in combination. The majority of restaurant pagers fall into this category.|$|R
5000|$|Limitations on back-up beepers: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) should reexamine its {{requirement}} for back-up <b>beepers</b> and trucks and vans. At the least, it should require back-up <b>beepers</b> of diminished volume.|$|R
50|$|Pagers {{themselves}} {{vary from}} very cheap and simple <b>beepers,</b> to more complex personal communications equipment, falling into eight main categories.|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{the other}} product lines {{such as the}} VS and OIS (both {{described}} below), Wang aggressively used value added resellers (VARs) to customize and market 2200 systems. One such creative solution deployed dozens of 2200 systems and was developed in conjunction with Hawaii- and Hong Kong-based firm, Algorithms, Inc. It provided paging (<b>beeper)</b> services {{for much of the}} Hong Kong market in the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Piezoelectric {{speakers}} {{are frequently}} used as beepers in watches and other electronic devices, and are sometimes used as tweeters in less-expensive speaker systems, such as computer speakers and portable radios. Piezoelectric speakers have several advantages over conventional loudspeakers: they {{are resistant to}} overloads that would normally destroy most high frequency drivers, {{and they can be}} used without a crossover due to their electrical properties. There are also disadvantages: some amplifiers can oscillate when driving capacitive loads like most piezoelectrics, which results in distortion or damage to the amplifier. Additionally, their frequency response, in most cases, is inferior to that of other technologies. This is why they are generally used in single frequency (<b>beeper)</b> or non-critical applications.|$|E
50|$|Their radio systems {{operate on}} a Motorola Conventional Wide Band System and most fire fighters also have <b>beepers</b> and/or motorola {{walkie-talkie}} phones.|$|R
5000|$|Marinelli and Banks then {{teamed with}} Emmy Award-winning {{composer}} Arthur B. Rubinstein, creating {{one of the}} first known digitally synthesized musical scores, Blue Thunder, released in 1983. The trio joined with Cynthia Morrow as The <b>Beepers,</b> and their songs, [...] "Video Fever" [...] and [...] "Long Line Leading To Men", made the soundtrack for the 1983 film, WarGames. The <b>Beepers</b> song [...] "Theme from Blue Thunder (Murphy's Law)" [...] was used in Blue Thunder with an instrumental version closing the film.|$|R
50|$|Another early skeptic was Denis's mother. She {{laid down}} rules that {{included}} no <b>beepers</b> or {{babies in the}} office, but she gradually learned to work with them.|$|R
25|$|Police officer Robert Riske was {{the first}} officer at the crime scene. He testified that he found a barefoot woman in a black dress lying face down in a puddle {{of blood on the}} walkway that led to the front door of her house. He next saw Goldman's body a short {{distance}} away, lying on its side beside a tree and off the walkway. Riske said he saw a white envelope, which was later found to contain the glasses left at the restaurant by Brown's mother. He also saw Goldman's <b>beeper,</b> a black leather glove, and a dark blue knit ski cap on the ground near the bodies. The front door of Brown's house was wide open, but there were no signs of forced entry nor any evidence that anyone had entered the premises. Nothing inside was out of the ordinary.|$|E
25|$|The series {{centers on}} a group of young cartoon {{characters}} who attend a school called Acme Looniversity to be the next generation of Looney Tunes characters. Most of the Tiny Toons characters were designed to resemble younger versions of Warner Bros.' most popular Looney Tunes animal characters by exhibiting similar traits and looks. The two main characters are both rabbits: Buster Bunny, a blue male rabbit, and Babs Bunny, a pink female rabbit not related to Buster, Plucky Duck, a green male duck, Hamton J. Pig, a pink male pig. Other major characters in the cast are generally nonhuman as well. These include Fifi La Fume, a purple-and-white female skunk; Shirley the Loon, a white female loon; Dizzy Devil, a purple tasmanian devil; Furrball, a blue cat; Sweetie Pie, a pink canary; Calamity Coyote, a bluish-gray coyote; Little <b>Beeper,</b> a red-orange roadrunner; and Gogo Dodo, a zany green dodo. Two human characters, Montana Max and Elmyra Duff, are regarded as the main villains of the series and also are students of Acme Looniversity. As villains, Elmyra is seen as an extreme pet lover while Montana Max is a spoiled rich brat who either owns lots of toys or polluting factories. Supporting characters included Li'l Sneezer, a gray mouse with powerful sneezes; Concord Condor, a purple condor; Byron Basset, a usually sleeping basset hound; Bookworm, a green worm with glasses; Arnold the Pit Bull, a muscular white pit bull; Fowlmouth, a white rooster with horrid language; Barky Marky, a brown dog, and Mary Melody, a young African American human girl.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{described}} the in-game narration as [...] "a nice touch", but noted some glitches among the otherwise [...] "distinctive engine and horn sounds". GameSpot called the game's sounds exceptional, praising its variety of car noises {{such as the}} back-up <b>beeper</b> for the bus. PC Zone praised the in-game radio system, and the support for external media players. AllGame said players [...] "get a dose of reality" [...] with other drivers and pedestrians [...] "hurling insults and exclamations your way".|$|E
50|$|Back-up <b>beepers</b> are {{criticized by}} the public and in {{scientific}} literature. <b>Beepers</b> top lists of complaints to government roadbuilders about road construction noise. There is published concern that people become habituated to the ubiquitous noise, diminishing its effectiveness. Strategies such as adjusting the volume according to the ambient noise and changing the tone to include sounds above 1600 Hz and below 800 Hz for improved localization would improve the alarm, but improvements are not cost-effective for the manufacturer and, if implemented by the equipment owner, introduce liability for the owner.|$|R
5000|$|Emmy Award-winning {{composer}} and conductor Arthur B. Rubinstein relied on Marinelli and Banks for the Rubinstein scored films, Blue Thunder (1983) and WarGames (1983). Marinelli is also credited on the Rubinstein score for Best of Times (1986), and Marinelli and Banks are credited on Stakeout (1987). Accustomed {{to working with}} classically trained musicians, Rubinstein joined in a musical group with Marinelli, Banks and vocalist Cynthia Morrow called The <b>Beepers.</b> Songs from The <b>Beepers</b> include [...] "Murphys Law", the theme song for Blue Thunder, [...] "Video Fever" [...] and [...] "History Lesson" [...] in WarGames.|$|R
50|$|Brains are {{not adapted}} {{for dealing with}} the {{repetitive}} and persistent sound of back-up <b>beepers,</b> but more towards natural sounds that dissipate. The sound is perceived as irritating or painful, which breaks concentration.|$|R
500|$|Sound {{output is}} through a <b>beeper</b> on the machine itself, capable of {{producing}} one channel with 10 octaves. [...] Software was later available that could play two channel sound. The machine includes an expansion bus edge connector and 3.5mm audio in/out ports for the connection of a cassette recorder for loading and saving programs and data. [...] The [...] "ear" [...] port can drive headphones and the [...] "mic" [...] port provides line level audio out which could be amplified.|$|E
500|$|With {{regard to}} {{continuous}} monitoring {{for a short}} period, the minority would rely on United States v. Knotts (1983) and decline to find {{a violation of the}} expectation of privacy. [...] In Knotts, a short-distance signal <b>beeper</b> in the defendant's car was tracked during a single trip for less than a day. The Knotts Court held that a person traveling on public roads has no expectation of privacy in his movements, because the vehicle's starting point, direction, stops, or final destination could be seen by anyone else on the road.|$|E
500|$|Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben {{began his}} {{argument}} for the United States by noting that information revealed to the world (i.e. movement on a public road) is not protected by the Fourth Amendment. Dreeben cited United States v. Knotts as an example where police were allowed to use a device known as a [...] "beeper" [...] that allows the tracking of a car from a short distance away. Chief Justice Roberts distinguished the current case from Knotts, saying that using a <b>beeper</b> still took [...] "a lot of work" [...] whereas a GPS device allows the police to [...] "sit back in the station ... and push a button whenever they {{want to find out}} where the car is." ...|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of Karakuri robots, both of which come in varying sizes: Workers and Keepers. Workers do odd jobs and include small Clunkers and the large Tornader. Keepers protect the ancient ruins and include tiny <b>Beepers</b> and the evil Zero.|$|R
25|$|Approaches used {{to treat}} those who suffer from {{anterograde}} amnesia often use interventions which focus on compensatory techniques, such as <b>beepers,</b> written notes, diaries or through intensive training programs involving the active participation of the individual concerned, along with their supporting network of family and friends.|$|R
50|$|According to the NITE the {{quantitative}} reasoning sections jointly determine 40% {{of the final}} score, the verbal reasoning sections another 40% and the English sections 20%. Use of calculators, alarm clocks, cellular telephones, <b>beepers,</b> electronic instruments of any kind, dictionaries, books, papers or any other study aids is strictly prohibited.|$|R
500|$|As {{the season}} progresses, the episodes become less about TGS {{and more about}} how the {{characters}} deal with juggling {{their lives and their}} jobsâ€”specifically the protagonist, Liz Lemon, but other characters are also explored. Episodes also become less self-contained and various story arcs develop {{in the second half of}} the season. For example, the first major story arc centers on Liz's relationship with Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters), [...] "The <b>Beeper</b> King". Other story arcs include: Jenna promoting her movie The Rural Juror; Tracy going on the run from the Black Crusaders; Jack's engagement, which was eventually called off, to a Christie's auctioneer named Phoebe (Emily Mortimer); and another relationship of Liz's with Floyd (Jason Sudeikis).|$|E
500|$|Inspired by live instrumentation, turntablism, {{and classic}} soul music, Tony! Toni! TonÃ©! {{recorded}} and produced their second album, The Revival, mostly themselves and released it in 1990 to commercial success. The record broadened the group's exposure to fans beyond their initial R audience. However, they became ambivalent about their newfound mainstream success and their music being labeled [...] "retro" [...] by critics. In {{an interview for}} People magazine, lead singer and bassist Raphael Wiggins expressed his dissatisfaction with the music industry, saying that [...] "every record company wants to get a group and put 'em in a Benz with a car phone and a <b>beeper,</b> show them dressing in three different outfits, {{put them in a}} video shot on a beach with lots of swinging bikinis. You won't ever see us on a beach. We're just down-to-earth, funky, like-to-play guys." [...] Before considering a follow-up album, the band recorded several songs for film soundtracks, including [...] "Me and You" [...] for Boyz n the Hood (1991), [...] "House Party (I Don't Know What You Come to Do)" [...] for House Party 2 (1991), and [...] "Waiting on You" [...] for Poetic Justice (1993).|$|E

5000|$|Back-up <b>beepers</b> or an {{observer}} {{are required by}} OSHA for earthmoving vehicles with an obstructed view to the rear and {{no one on the}} ground to help guide the driver. [...] Alarms are typically loud because manufacturers do not know the ambient noise level where the machines will be used.|$|R
5000|$|The {{indicator}} may be {{an electric}} light or a buzzer. This led to the term [...] "buzzing out a circuit" [...] (which means to test for continuity) Audible continuity buzzers or <b>beepers</b> are built into some models of multimeter, and the continuity setting is normally shared with the ohmmeter setting.|$|R
50|$|The {{language}} {{has also been}} implemented as Karel the Dog in JavaScript by CodeHS. Similar to the original language, this implementation features Karel in a grid world. Programmers use and build upon Karel's simple vocabulary of commands to accomplish programming tasks. Instead of putting and picking <b>beepers,</b> Karel the Dog puts and takes tennis balls.|$|R
2500|$|O'Grady radioed {{for help}} {{immediately}} {{but had to}} remain quiet with paramilitaries coming within feet of him; he used the radio following standard operating procedures as the U.S. Air Force had taught him so not to give away his position to unfriendly forces. On his 6th night on the ground he made radio contact, signalling his location using his radio's limited battery power. NATO planes conducting sorties in the Balkans had been picking up <b>beeper</b> snippets that they thought could be coming from O'Grady. This extremely sensitive information was inadvertently revealed by General Ronald Fogleman, the Air Force Chief of Staff, when the general told reporters attending a promotion ceremony that monitors had detected [...] "intermittent" [...] transmissions. A NATO official {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I was dumbfounded he said that... I mean, why not just announce to the bad guys, 'We think he's alive and kicking, and we hope we find him before you do'?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Hodgson {{approached}} Jim Mallon, at {{the time}} the production manager of KTMA, a low-budget local television station, with his idea of a show based on riffing on movies, using robots that were created out of common objects. Mallon agreed to help produce a pilot episode, and Hodgson hired on local area comedians J. Elvis Weinstein (initially going by Josh Weinstein but later changed to J. Elvis as to distinguish himself from Josh Weinstein, a well-known writer for The Simpsons) and Trace Beaulieu to develop the pilot show. By September 1988, Hodgson, Mallon, Weinstein, and Beaulieu shot a 30-minute pilot episode, using segments from the 1968 science-fiction film The Green Slime. The robots and the set were built by Hodgson in an all-nighter. Joel watched the movie by himself, and was aided during the host segments by his robots, Crow (Beaulieu), <b>Beeper,</b> and Gypsy (Weinstein). Hodgson used the narrative that his character named [...] "Joel Hodgson" [...] (not yet using his character name of Robinson) had built the Satellite of Love and launched himself into space. Camera work was by Kevin Murphy, who worked at television station KTMA. Murphy also created the first doorway sequence and theater seat design. These initial episodes were recorded at the since-defunct Paragon Cable studios and customer service center in Hopkins, Minnesota.|$|E
2500|$|Voice {{director}} Andrea Romano auditioned over 1,200 voices for {{the series}} and chose {{more than a dozen}} main voice actors. The role of Buster Bunny was given to Charlie Adler, who gave the role, as producer Tom Ruegger said, [...] "a great deal of energy". The role of Babs Bunny was given to Tress MacNeille. Writer Paul Dini said that MacNeille was good for the role because she could do both Babs' voice and the voices of her impressions. Voice actors Joe Alaskey and Don Messick were given the roles of Plucky Duck and Hamton J. Pig, respectively. Danny Cooksey played Montana Max and, according to Paul Dini, was good for the role because he could do a [...] "tremendous mean voice." [...] Cooksey was also the only voice actor in the cast who was not an adult. Cree Summer played the roles of Elmyra Duff and Mary Melody; former Saturday Night Live cast member Gail Matthius played Shirley the Loon, and Kath Soucie had the roles of Fifi La Fume and Li'l Sneezer. Other actors {{for the series}} included Maurice LaMarche as the voice of Dizzy Devil; Candi Milo as the voice of Sweetie, Frank Welker as the voice of Gogo Dodo, Furrball, Byron Basset, Calamity Coyote, Little <b>Beeper,</b> Barky Marky, and other voices; and Rob Paulsen as the voice of Fowlmouth, Arnold the Pit Bull, Concord Condor, and other characters. The legendary voice behind the Looney Tunes, Mel Blanc was set to reprise his roles as the classic characters, but died in July 1989. His characters were replaced by the likes of Jeff Bergman, Joe Alaskey, Greg Burson, and Mel's son, Noel Blanc.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Beepers</b> were an American music band {{consisting}} of Anthony Marinelli, Arthur B. Rubinstein, Brian Banks and Cynthia Morrow. They provided the theme song, [...] "Murphy's Law" [...] for the film, Blue Thunder (1983), their single [...] "Video Fever" [...] {{and the song}} [...] "History Lesson" [...] {{is used in the}} soundtrack for the 1983 film WarGames.|$|R
50|$|Media {{interpreting}} {{has gained}} more visibility and presence {{especially after the}} Gulf War. Television channels have begun to hire staff simultaneous interpreters. The interpreter renders the press conferences, telephone <b>beepers,</b> interviews and similar live coverage for the viewers. It is more stressful than other types of interpreting as the interpreter {{has to deal with}} a wide range of technical problems coupled with the control room's hassle and wrangling during live coverage.|$|R
5000|$|This {{reference}} actually {{refers to}} switching from Motorola <b>beepers</b> {{to the newly}} introduced PrimeCo cell phone in the late nineties. This {{would have a significant}} impact on the [...] "Baller's" [...] efficiency. The simple fact that you no longer had to stop and find a pay phone in order to respond to the beep you just received. Certain street business activities were exponentiated over the next couple of years with the advent of cellular phones.|$|R
