5|$|Later in 1790, Hamilton issued {{another set}} of {{recommendations}} in his Second Report on Public Credit. The report called {{for the establishment of}} a national bank and an excise tax on distilled spirits. Hamilton's proposed national bank would provide credit to fledgling industries, serve as a depository for government funds, and oversee one nationwide currency. In response to Hamilton's proposal, Congress passed the <b>Bank</b> <b>Bill</b> of 1791, establishing the First Bank of the United States. The following year, it passed the Coinage Act of 1792, establishing the United States Mint, and the United States dollar, and regulating the coinage of the United States. Historian Samuel Morison points to Hamilton's Second Report as the event that precipitated Jefferson's change of attitude toward Hamilton and his policies. Jefferson feared that the creation of the national bank would lead to political, economic, and social inequality, with Northern financial interests dominating American society much as aristocrats dominated European society.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill passed}} through the Senate {{practically}} without a problem, but objections of the proposal increased {{by the time it}} reached the House of Representatives. It was generally held by critics that Hamilton was serving the interests of the Northeast by means of the bank, and those of the agrarian lifestyle would not benefit from it. Among those critics was James Jackson of Georgia, who also attempted to refute the report by quoting from The Federalist Papers. Madison and Jefferson also opposed the <b>bank</b> <b>bill.</b> The potential of the capital not being moved to the Potomac if the bank was to have a firm establishment in Philadelphia (the current capital of the United States) was a more significant reason, and actions that Pennsylvania members of Congress took to keep the capital there made both men anxious.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} extent of use of {{treasury}} <b>bills</b> and central <b>bank</b> <b>bills</b> as monetary policy instrument by level of development of countries, and problems caused from using two securities simultaneously. Very interestingly, {{it is observed that}} advanced countries tend to have either treasury <b>bills</b> or central <b>bank</b> <b>bills</b> while less advanced countries use both bills. Also the advanced countries are discovered to use more treasury <b>bills</b> than central <b>bank</b> <b>bills.</b> It is also found that employment of two securities leads to bond market segmentation, profit deterioration of central bank, and increase of government debt. Based on these problems caused by using two bills simultaneously, I suggest that central <b>bank</b> <b>bills</b> should be integrated into treasury bills in those countries in which two bills are used at the same time. As for the integration, I recommend that maturity of two bills need to be adjusted before long, resulting in short- and long-term for treasury securities and mid-term for central <b>bank</b> <b>bills...</b>|$|R

Ellsworth served as a key Senate ally to Alexander Hamilton and aligned with the Federalist Party. He led the Senate passage of Hamiltonian proposals such as the Funding Act of 1790 and the <b>Bank</b> <b>Bill</b> of 1791.

I had indeed another <b>bank</b> <b>bill</b> about me of #30, which was the whole of what I brought with me, as well to subsist on in the country, as not knowing what might offer; because this creature, the go-between that had thus betrayed us both, had made me believe strange things of my marrying to my advantage in the country, and I was not willing to be without money, whatever might happen. This bill I concealed, and that made me the freer of the rest, in consideration of his circumstances, for I really pitied him heartily.|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} it was very unhappy that so much love, and so much good nature as I {{discovered}} in him, should be thus precipitated into misery; that I saw nothing before us but ruin; for as to me, it was my unhappiness that what little I had was not able to relieve us week, and with that I pulled out a <b>bank</b> <b>bill</b> of #20 and eleven guineas, which I told him I had saved out of my little income, and that by the account that creature had given me of the way of living in that country, I expected it would maintain me three or four years; that if it was taken from me, I was left destitute, and he knew what the condition of a woman among strangers must be, if she had no money in her pocket; however, I told him, if he would take it, there it was.|$|E

They recalled his services to free trade when he stood by the side of Peel; his budget of 1860; his conspicuous and honourable share in abolishing the taxes on knowledge. “We have marked,” they said, “your manifestations of sympathy with the down-trodden and oppressed of every clime. You have advanced the cause of freedom in foreign lands by the power and courage with which you have assailed and exposed the misdeeds and cruelties of continental tyrants. To the provident operative you have by your Post Office Savings <b>Bank</b> <b>bill</b> given security for his small savings, and your Government Annuities bill of this session is a measure which will stimulate the people to greater thrift and forethought. These acts, together with your speeches on the last named, and on the Borough Franchise bill, make up a life that commands our lasting gratitude.” Such was the new popular estimate of him. In framing his reply to this address Mr. Gladstone did his best to discourage the repetition of like performances from other places; he submitted the draft to Lord Palmerston, and followed his advice in omitting certain portions of it. It was reduced to the conventional type of such acknowledgment.|$|E

Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Attorney General Edmund Randolph concurred with Madison that the federal government was one of strictly enumerated powers, and bolstered that argument by citing the Tenth Amendment, advancing the position of states' rights and limited federal power. [...] Secretary Hamilton’s famous rebuttal on the Bank submitted to Washington on February 23, 1791, introduced the doctrine of “implied powers,” based on the principle of broad construction of the Constitution. He argued that the authority to create the First Bank of the United States, though not explicitly mandated [...] in the Constitution, was nevertheless inherent to a central government, and required in order to fulfill its duties prescribed in the founding document. This “broad” or “liberal” [...] interpretation swayed President Washington, who signed the <b>bank</b> <b>bill</b> on February 25, 1791. [...] Hamilton’s success in advancing his fiscal and financial schemes [...] moved Madison and Jefferson towards establishing the political foundations for a two-party system.
