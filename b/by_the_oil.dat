About 18,000people in 20 low-lying {{communities in the}} state of Tamaulipas, just south of the U.S.-Mexican border, were evacuated. Including losses sustained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> industry, damage in Mexico amounted to 8.87billion pesos ($834.3million).|$|E
5|$|Marine {{researchers}} {{note that}} mammals and birds {{get the most}} attention but smaller creatures {{at the base of}} the ocean food chain are also harmed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil.</b> Life on the sea floor and near the shore such as mussels, barnacles, and other shellfish are unable to move out of the way. When exposed to oil, these organisms suffer 90%-plus mortality and recovery of the population can take decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{build-up}} {{of toxins}} and pollutants in seabirds {{is also a}} concern. Seabirds, being apex predators, suffered from the ravages of DDT until it was banned; among other effects, DDT was implicated in embryo development problems and the skewed sex ratio of western gulls in southern California. Oil spills are also a threat to seabird species, as both a toxin and because the feathers of the birds become saturated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil,</b> causing them to lose their waterproofing. Oil pollution threatens species with restricted ranges or already depressed populations.|$|E

40|$|Petroleum spray oils (PSOs) kill {{insect pests}} on contact, and the {{composition}} of modern PSOs is substantially different from the ones introduced earlier. The effects of direct application of a new nC 24 PSO on the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover, were therefore determined. This covered not only aphid mortality rates but also {{the way in which}} <b>the</b> <b>oils</b> affected aphid behaviour at the time of contact with <b>the</b> <b>oil.</b> Direct application of <b>the</b> nC 24 <b>oil</b> proved to be highly effective in controlling A. gossypii at a range of concentrations between 1 and 10 % v/v. <b>The</b> <b>oil</b> killed cotton aphids quickly, with most of the mortality occurring within the first 10 min of spraying. The fast killing action of <b>the</b> <b>oils</b> prevented any behavioural. responses <b>by</b> <b>the</b> aphids. Aphids killed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>oils</b> became flaccid and their legs and antennae extended horizontally relative to the body axis. With time, their cuticle became very shiny and began to darken. The quick death of the aphids suggested a contact mode of action of <b>the</b> <b>oils,</b> an interpretation supported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack of any negative effect on aphids not initially reached <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>oils.</b> However, those aphids not hit <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>oils,</b> but that subsequently encountered oil-treated areas when they moved elsewhere, also died, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> deposits are also toxic to the aphids. The mode of action of <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> thus seems to be versatile, and <b>the</b> means <b>by</b> which it kills the aphids may be more complex than anoxia, which is the widely claimed mechanism attributed to PSOs. This oil now needs to be tested for any possible indirect effects on the cotton aphid (e. g. through its host-plant acceptance behaviour). The implications of the present findings for cotton aphid control and assessment of PSO efficacy in the field are discussed. (c) 2007 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R

5|$|Another {{indirect}} {{effect of the}} boom was the growth of gambling and prostitution in many communities. These activities had not been uncommon in Texas before the boom, but the wealth brought <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> industry, as well as difficulties in enhancing the laws and the law enforcement agencies, created many new opportunities for illegal businesses and organized crime. Many communities developed casino and red-light districts; notably the gaming empire in Galveston, which attracted wealthy businessmen from Houston and lasted into the 1950s, was the longest lasting of all of these. Prostitution, which had always been present in the state, flourished in the boom towns, which were crowded with single men earning relatively high wages. The onset of Prohibition and the state government's reluctance to enforce vice laws only encouraged the growth of gambling and bootlegging during this period.|$|E
5|$|In September, {{one of the}} {{aircraft}} was displayed at Farnborough Airshow, and Norsk Forurensningskontroll stated that they hoped to sell the technology abroad.

5|$|Nixon {{supported}} {{the pipeline project}} even before the oil crisis. On September 10, 1973, he released a message stating that the pipeline was his priority {{for the remainder of}} the Congressional session that year. On November 8, after the embargo had been in place for three weeks, he reaffirmed that statement. Members of Congress, under pressure from their constituents, created the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, which removed all legal barriers from construction of the pipeline, provided financial incentives, and granted a right-of-way for its construction. The act was drafted, rushed through committee, and approved by the House on November 12, 1973, by a vote of 361–14–60. The next day, the Senate passed it, 80–5–15. Nixon signed it into law on November 16, and a federal right-of-way for the pipeline and transportation highway was granted on January 3, 1974. The deal was signed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> companies on January 23, allowing work to start.|$|E

5|$|France voiced {{concerns}} over the artificially low price of gold in 1968 and called for returns to the former gold standard. Meanwhile, excess dollars flowed into international markets as the United States expanded its money supply to accommodate the costs of its military campaign in the Vietnam War. Its gold reserves were assaulted by speculative investors following its first current account deficit since the 19th century. In August 1971, President Richard Nixon suspended the exchange of U.S. dollars for gold {{as part of the}} Nixon Shock. The closure of the gold window effectively shifted the adjustment burdens of a devalued dollar to other nations. Speculative traders chased other currencies and began selling dollars in anticipation of these currencies being revalued against the dollar. These influxes of capital presented difficulties to foreign central banks, which then faced choosing among inflationary money supplies, largely ineffective capital controls, or floating exchange rates. Following these woes surrounding the U.S. dollar, the dollar price of gold was raised to $38 USD per ounce and the Bretton Woods system was modified to allow fluctuations within an augmented band of 2.25% as part of the Smithsonian Agreement signed by the G-10 members in December 1971. The agreement delayed the system's demise for a further two years. The system's erosion was expedited not only by the dollar devaluations that occurred, but also <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> crises of the 1970s which emphasized the importance of international financial markets in petrodollar recycling and balance of payments financing. Once the world's reserve currency began to float, other nations began adopting floating exchange rate regimes.|$|E
