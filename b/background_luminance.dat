Intraoperative FMERGs (iFMERGs) were recorded in ten patients (10 eyes) who undergo vitrectomy. iFMERGs were elicited by focal macular stimulation. The stimulus light was directed to the macular area through a 25 gauge (25 G) glass fiber optic bundle. Background light was delivered through a dual chandelier-type light fiber probe. Focal macular responses elicited with combinations of stimulus and <b>background</b> <b>luminances</b> were analyzed. A stimulus luminance that was approximately 1. 75 log units brighter than the background light was able to elicit focal macular responses that were not contaminated by stray light responses.

40|$|Summary Simple {{reaction}} {{times to}} a visual stimulus include visual response {{time as well}} as cognitive and motor response umes. To isolate visual response =e and to linut the influence of the cognitive and motor components, a novel psychophysical technique was developecl Two identical targets were flashed, one to each eye of a human subject, against different <b>background</b> <b>luminances</b> and at different times. When the subject perceived the two targets as Sashing simultaneously, the diSerence in presenta-tion times was taken as the measure of the rehtive visual reaction time necessary to process a target at different adaptation levels. Reaction-time differences as measured by this new technique corroborate data from simple reaction times but show much less variability. A small bur measurable drifting of the comparative performance of each eye was observed, perhaps placing an upper limit on the precision of the method. This new technique is an efficient way to determine mesopic luminous efficiency func. tions, among other possible uses. ...|$|R

The Unified Glare Probability (UGP), developed using 493 surveys under clear skies in Brisbane, Australia, shows promise as useful tool for estimating glare from windows.

In the experiment, the change in the discomfort glare, depending on the change in the <b>background</b> <b>luminance,</b> was measured using different sizes of glare sources.

Despite recent scientific advances, the contextual and environmental conditions that most affect the mechanisms of visual imagery remain unclear. It has been previously shown that the greater the level of <b>background</b> <b>luminance</b> the weaker the effect of imagery on subsequent perception. However, in these experiments it was unclear whether the luminance was affecting imagery generation or storage of a memory trace. Here, we report that <b>background</b> <b>luminance</b> can attenuate both mental imagery generation and imagery storage during an unrelated cognitive task. However, imagery generation was more sensitive to the degree of luminance. In addition, we show that these findings were not due to differential dark adaptation. These results suggest that afferent visual signals can interfere with both the formation and priming-memory effects associated with visual imagery.

40|$|The Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) {{published}} {{a system for}} visual performance-based mesopic photometry in 2010. It is valid between the luminances 0. 005 cd/m 2 and 5 cd/m 2. In night-time driving conditions, the luminances in the visual scene are in the mesopic range; thus, mesopic photometry should be adopted when assessing lighting in outdoor areas and other night-time traffic environments. In order to implement the CIE mesopic photometry, the <b>background</b> photopic <b>luminance,</b> i. e. adaptation luminance, is required as an input value. The aim {{of the study is}} to develop methods for estimating the field of view of which the luminance is to be used as the adaptation luminance in implementing the CIE 191 system for mesopic photometry. This is realised by applying methods such as combining eye-tracking data with corresponding luminance data and analysing peripheral target detection under uniform and non-uniform luminous backgrounds. In the study of combining eye-tracking measurements with luminance data, the visual scene areas with the highest density of gaze distributions were determined. The measured luminances for these visual scenes were used to form an estimate of the adaptation luminance under different driving conditions in the lit and the unlit sections of a rural road. The mean luminances of the estimated fields were higher in the unlit section than in the lit section of the route for all drivers. This was due to high-beam head-lights that illuminated the road surface, whereas the gaze points were concentrated in the unlit section. Experiments in laboratory conditions were conducted in order to obtain the effect of background and target location and its luminance on visual performance. Reaction time and contrast threshold measurements were made to analyse peripheral target detection in uniform and non-uniform backgrounds. Under non-uniform <b>background</b> <b>luminances,</b> peripheral target detection depends on the local luminance of the target and the luminance uniformity of the surrounding area of the target. The results verify that each part of the retina adjusts its sensitivity independently, which refers to local adaptation. However, the complexity of the visual field also has an effect on visual sensitivity in peripheral vision. Further studies, where road type, driving speed and discomforting glare are taken into account, are needed to define the visual adaptation field and corresponding adaptation luminance in various driving conditions...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE The {{presence}} of a bright light source in the visual field can generate visual discomfort. Based on empirical observations we can predict to a reasonable degree of accuracy how uncomfortable a given lighting installation is likely to be; yet very {{little is known about}} the mechanism or physiological underpinnings that lead to visual discomfort. This study attempts to elucidate some of the underlying mechanisms by controlling the amount of light reaching the retina and by varying photometric properties of the glare-source. METHODS The participants were required to view a source of light presented against a simulated residential-street background in the form of uniform flashes of light of varying intensity. Discomfort-glare thresholds were estimated using a staircase procedure; the dependent variable was retinal illuminance. The size of the glare-source and the luminance of the surrounding background were varied systematically. RESULTS Across glare-source sizes or <b>background</b> <b>luminances</b> the discomfort-glare threshold varied less in terms of retinal illuminance than it did in terms of pupil-plane illuminance or light flux. A two-stage model based on saturation of photoreceptors followed by summation of an edge response signal that defines the edges of the glare-source accurately predicted the data. CONCLUSIONS Discomfort glare in central vision is more closely associated with the spatial properties of the glare-source, such as contrast-defined edges, than the overall amount of light entering the eye. The results suggest that discomfort glare in lighting installations could be reduced while maintaining adequate illuminance levels by an appropriate choice of illuminant source size...|$|R
