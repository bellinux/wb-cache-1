Ender's Game was written with no {{concessions}} to young readers. My protagonists were children, but the book was definitely not aimed at kids. I was perfectly aware that {{the rule of thumb}} for children’s literature is that the protagonist must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years older than the target audience. You want ten-year-old readers, you have a twelve-year-old hero.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{location}} of the Chera capital has been subject to some speculation. The Chera capital has been called, 'Vanchi' and 'Karur' in several works. This has led to several theories identifying the Chera capital in places named Karur in both Kerala and Tamil Nadu. However, it is fairly clear that the capital was near the famous port known as Muziris, now identified to be near modern-day Kodungallur. Pliny refers to Muziris as the Chera capital, while {{the author of the}} Periplus identifies the capital to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> miles away {{from the mouth of the}} river at Muziris. Ptolemy who identifies the capital as 'Karoura' gives a geographical location that is very close to Muziris as well. The capital of the Cheras and the port of Muziris were very close and almost indistinguishable.|$|E
25|$|At Monza, he {{qualified}} in tenth, and had {{a rather}} lonely run {{in the race to}} finish in the same place to score another point. In Singapore, the FW32 sported a new front wing, and Barrichello put this to good use to set the sixth fastest time in qualifying, although Williams technical director Sam Michael reckoned the car was fast enough to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> positions higher. In the race despite losing places to Robert Kubica and Nico Rosberg at the start, Barrichello had a solid run to sixth at the finish. In Japan, he qualified in a strong seventh, he raced strongly before fading to ninth as he was overtaken by the two Saubers towards the closing stages of the race. It was later revealed that an apparent loss of grip he had suffered during the race was caused by a six per cent loss of downforce.|$|E
25|$|Sedimentary {{rocks are}} {{laid down in}} layers called beds or strata. A bed {{is defined as a}} layer of rock that has a uniform {{lithology}} and texture. Beds form by the deposition of layers of sediment on top of each other. The sequence of beds that characterizes sedimentary rocks is called bedding. Single beds can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> centimetres to several meters thick. Finer, less pronounced layers are called laminae, and the structure it forms in a rock is called lamination. Laminae are usually less than a few centimetres thick. Though bedding and lamination are often originally horizontal in nature, this is not always the case. In some environments, beds are deposited at a (usually small) angle. Sometimes multiple sets of layers with different orientations exist in the same rock, a structure called cross-bedding. Cross-bedding forms when small-scale erosion occurs during deposition, cutting off part of the beds. Newer beds then form at an angle to older ones.|$|E

500|$|Initial {{critical}} response towards Aurora {{was generally}} unfavorable. During the 1950s, Disney received [...] "harsh criticism" [...] for depicting both Cinderella and Aurora as [...] "naïve and malleable" [...] characters, {{and failing to}} acknowledge {{the ways in which}} women's roles in society had evolved since Snow White's debut in 1937. Critics agree that Aurora represents [...] "the classic damsel in distress" [...] by being depicted as a beautiful young woman who is rescued by a stranger. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times felt that the character was too similar to Snow White, writing, [...] "The princess looks so much like Snow White they could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> Miss Rheingolds separated by three or four years." [...] Time Out dismissed Aurora as a [...] "delicate" [...] and [...] "vapid" [...] character. Bustle's Mary Grace Garis wrote that the character [...] "suffers from having very little definable personality and ... serious Damsel-in-Distress syndrome". Sonia Saraiya of Jezebel echoed this sentiment, criticizing Aurora for lacking [...] "interesting qualities"; Saraiya also ranked Aurora Disney's least feminist princess. Similarly, Bustle also ranked Aurora the least feminist Disney Princess, with author Chelsea Mize expounding, [...] "Aurora literally sleeps for like three quarters of the movie ... Aurora just straight-up has no agency, and really isn't doing {{much in the way of}} feminine progress." [...] Dismissing the character as [...] "barely more than a cipher", Leigh Butler of Tor.com panned Aurora as [...] "a Barbie doll knockoff who does nothing the whole film but sing wistfully about Finding Her Man, before becoming the ultimate passive Damsel in Distress". However, Butler went on to defend the character somewhat, writing, [...] "Aurora’s cipher-ness in Sleeping Beauty would be infuriating if she were the only female character in it, but the presence of the Fairies and Maleficent allow her to be what she is without it being a subconscious statement on what all women are." [...] Similarly, Refinery29 ranked Aurora the fourth most feminist Disney Princess because [...] "Her aunts have essentially raised her in a place where women run the game." ...|$|E

It's sort of like I'm taken over or someone's trying to contact me; I really believe very much that I'm in some ways channeling this thing. Because when I write a song it's always done very quickly, completed in 20minutes or maybe half an hour. I never labour anything, or very rarely. The only labouring I've ever done in songwriting might be when I've completed a work, a song, and there might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> lyrics I don't like, so sometimes I might sit with those and really put some brain power in how to fix up the lines.

2500|$|Upon {{its initial}} release, Sleeping Beauty {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from film critics. Bosley Crowther, writing {{in his review}} for The New York Times, complimented that [...] "the colors are rich, the sounds are luscious and magic sparkles spurt charmingly from wands", but criticized its familiarity with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. He further wrote that [...] "the princess looks so much like Snow White they could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> Miss Rheingolds separated by three or four years. And she has the same magical rapport with the little creatures of the woods. The witch is the same slant-eyed Circe who worked her evil on Snow White. And the three good fairies could be maiden sisters of the misogynistic seven dwarfs." [...] Variety praised the singing voices of Mary Costa and Bill Shirley and noted that [...] "some of {{the best parts of}} the picture are those dealing with the three good fairies, spoken and sung by Verna Felton, Barbara Jo Allen and Barbara Luddy." [...] The New York Daily News described the film as [...] "enchanting".|$|E

2500|$|Soon after 4 August, in Hall's Chronicle, as in Holinshed and Lesley, as [...] "Lieutenant-General of Scotland," [...] Albany {{summoned the}} army to relieve Berwick Castle to meet on 8 August at Cranshaws {{on the way to}} Duns, but told Gloucester it was a pretence. Gloucester {{declared}} that if Albany opposed him at Berwick, he would defend the besiegers or die in the attempt. However, the council of Scotland was reluctant to fight and instead drafted a surrender of Berwick Castle by treaty in Edinburgh on 24 August. When the document was sealed by both parties, which would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days later as Gloucester was now at Berwick or Alnwick, Berwick Castle was delivered straightaway, [...] "incontinent," [...] to Lord Stanley. It is possible either that the castle fell to Stanley before Albany's negotiations with the council were completed and agreed by Gloucester, as Edward IV's letter to the Pope may suggest, or that Edward IV anticipated the castle would be taken by force when he wrote.|$|E
