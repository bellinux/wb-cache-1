5|$|Bradley Meek, {{writing for}} THEM Anime, gave the series 3/5 stars. He praised {{the way the}} series {{maintained}} its horror-based atmosphere in between the action sequences. He greatly enjoyed the horror and action aspects, but felt that the character-driven segments in early episodes threatened to drag down the whole experience due to mundane content and poor characters. Talking about the anime's second half, {{he said that it}} drastically altered the pace and content to the point that viewers might <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>off</b> with its conscious bending of the rules of handling characters and viewers alike—Meek was ultimately angry at the series' brutal ending, but it also left him eager to see its movie conclusion.|$|E
5|$|While {{developing}} Fast Five, Universal Studios deliberately {{departed from}} the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>off</b> by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls, and the heist of $100million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at NASCAR races.|$|E
5|$|In April 1869, the U.S. Senate {{overwhelmingly}} {{rejected a}} proposed treaty which paid too little and contained no admission of British guilt for prolonging the war. Senator Charles Sumner spoke up before congress; publicly denounced Queen Victoria; demanded a huge reparation; {{and opened the}} possibility of Canada ceded to the United States as payment. The speech angered the British government, and talks had to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>off</b> until matters cooled down. Negotiations for a new treaty began in January 1871 when Britain sent Sir John Rose to America to meet with Fish. A joint high commission was created on February 9, 1871 in Washington, consisting of representatives from both Britain and the United States. The commission created a treaty where an international Tribunal would settle the damage amounts; the British admitted regret, not fault, over the destructive actions of the Confederate war cruisers. Grant approved and signed the treaty on May 8, 1871; the Senate ratified the Treaty of Washington on May 24, 1871.|$|E

5|$|Posehn had a {{difficult}} time working within the Genesis's output resolution of 320×240. He wanted to show as much of the playing field as possible without losing the details of the sprites; he felt a lack of graphical detail would make them less interesting. Posehn developed a dynamic camera system to help maintain what he felt was the right balance between the size of the field in view {{and the size of the}} game objects. The camera travels on an elliptic curve as the helicopter rotates to change the direction it travels; this puts whatever is in front of the helicopter more in view on screen. Posehn also integrated momentum to the camera movements to smooth transitions. He spent several months working on the physics for the screen and helicopter to ensure realistic movement. Instead of using completely accurate physics, Posehn chose to model movement that he believed players would assume a helicopter would have. He believed players would <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>off</b> by physics that didn't match their perceived movement.|$|E
5|$|Richard Vines, whilst {{writing for}} Bloomberg, advised readers to not <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>off</b> the hype; {{and while the}} courses are not as life {{changing}} as those served at The Fat Duck, there are stand out dishes such as the meat fruit and the tipsy cake. He {{also noted that the}} meat fruit was a favourite of Pierre Koffmann. Marina O'Loughlin visited the restaurant twice for the Metro newspaper, once just after opening and again several months later to compare how it had settled in. She thought it was a well-oiled operation, but a little too much so, and questioned the originality of it as a version of the meat fruit had previously been available at the restaurant Amber in another Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong and little touches as the years of origin which appear next to the menu items have been used before by Marco Pierre White. Jan Moir for The Daily Mail thought that the ice cream trolley was a sensation, along with the meat fruit, but could not understand the reason behind recreating the salamagundy dish.|$|E
5|$|The counter-arguments {{were much}} stronger. The {{assumption}} that the Germans would <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>off</b> by losses was wrong; {{it would have taken}} severe losses for the OKL to change its mind on target selection. The targets were also vital. The airfields themselves supported the squadrons in the field, while the loss of the vital sector-stations could well have crippled the defence system. Thus the possibility of allowing the bulk of the German bombers to reach their target unscathed was unacceptable. The idea that the Big Wing could inflict heavier losses than had been achieved up until then was based on an overestimate of the numbers of aircraft shot down by the Big Wing. Leigh-Mallory, Sholto Douglas and Bader had based their opinions on claims made by RAF units in battle. However, particularly when a large number of aircraft were engaged, it was possible for the same aircraft to be claimed by more than one pilot. As a result, the RAF claimed 100 or more German aircraft shot down in one day on five occasions, while analysis of Luftwaffe losses has shown that there were only four occasions on which the Luftwaffe lost more than 50 aircraft, and never did they lose 100 or more in a day. Nevertheless, while it is not known whether Mallory and Bader were aware that the claims of the RAF and Big Wings were exaggerated, they certainly tried to use them as a potent tool with which to remove Park and Dowding from command and pursue the Big Wing tactic.|$|E

25|$|After {{graduating in}} Modern History in 1932 she asked Arthur Evans {{to accept her}} as a student helper at Knossos. Evans had led this major project for decades but by this time {{excavations}} were directed by John Pendlebury, who became a mentor to Seiradaki. As well as excavating he undertook a major reorganisation of the on-site Stratigraphical Museum, a task in which Seiradaki would take a large part. She was accepted as {{a student of the}} British School at Athens {{at the same time as}} Edith Eccles who became a friend with whom she worked and travelled. Her endurance and stamina on difficult journeys over mountain tracks were noteworthy. There were several young women archaeologists from the UK and all were determined not to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>off</b> by difficult terrain and challenging routes, and yet Seiradaki stood out for her reluctance even to ride a mule instead of walking.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{which is}} growing in practice {{is the use of}} a hollow piercing needle, as is done in body piercing. The piercer disinfects the earlobe with alcohol and puts a mark on the lobe with a pen. It gives the opportunity to the client to check whether the position is correct or not. Then, the piercer uses a clamp with flat ends and holes at the end to hold the earlobe, with the dot {{in the middle of the}} holes. This device will support the skin during the piercing process. A cork can be placed behind the earlobe to stop the movement of the needle after the piercing process, and protect the tip of the needle for the client's comfort. Then, the piercer places the hollow needle perpendicular to the skin's surface and check the position of the needle, to pierce at the desired place and the right angle. The piercing process consists of pushing the needle through the earlobe, until it gets out in the other side. The client has to remain still during all the process. Then, the clamp can <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>off.</b> After that, the piercer puts the jewel in the hollow needle and pushes the needle through until the jewel enters into the lobe. Then, the needle is removed and disposed properly. The jewel is attached to the lobe and the piercer disinfects the lobe again.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 12 March, while sailing near the Louisiade Islands, one of the ship's stokers was stabbed {{fourteen}} times, and died from peritonitis during the night. Before dying, the stoker informed the ship's surgeon that he had threatened to expose the homosexual relationship between two other stokers, {{which led to the}} attack. The two accused stokers were imprisoned, and a court-martial was held between 15 and 18 March, while the ship was anchored at Nouméa. The stokers were found guilty of the first ever murder aboard an Australian warship; under British naval regulations (which the RAN was operating under), the men were to be hanged from the cruiser's yardarm. However, despite Captain Harold Farncomb's aggressive prosecution of the two men, he successfully requested that the death sentences <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>off</b> at least until the ship returned home. As the men were convicted under British military law, the matter of commuting their sentences was out of Australian hands until an appeal for clemency was made to King George VI, who downgraded the sentence to life imprisonment. This situation had arisen because the Australian government had not yet adopted the Statute of Westminster 1931, a British Act which defined the Dominions as sovereign governments capable of amending or repealing previous British legislation affecting them, while preventing the British government from legislating on the Dominions' behalf unless requested. Prompted by the murder, along with issues relating to the legal control of shipping in Australian ports, and the National Security Act, a bill ratifying the Statute was passed on 9 October and backdated {{to the start of the}} war. The sentences of the two stokers were reduced several times, and they were freed in September 1950.|$|E

Writers Weddle and Thompson considered giving the characters some leeway in interpreting what they had found. [...] Among the options debated were giving the fleet some hope that Earth might be some other planet, allowing a character to discover a new part of the Prophecy of Pythia, giving one of the characters a vision of an Earth-like planet, and placing a clue in the ruins that would direct the fleet to yet another planet. All were rejected.|$|E

[...] Another reviewer, GoldfishX, gave it a five, calling it [...] "possibly the most ear-grating, hideous sound I have ever encountered in game music" [...] but not giving it a worse score because [...] "Ishiwatari deserves a ton of credit for putting together such brilliant compositions on such pathetic-sounding hardware." ...|$|E

GameSpot {{said that the}} soundtrack is [...] "well suited to the game and never intrusive", while Victor Lucas of The Electric Playground described it as [...] "suspenseful, dynamic and always adrenaline charged." [...] Similarly, Tim Weaver of N64 Magazine credited the music for being [...] "dramatically scored, with strings, tom toms, bass lines and nerve-juddering screeches as enemies spring out at you from all angles."

500|$|At Craigmillar Castle, near Edinburgh, {{at the end}} of November 1566, Mary {{and leading}} nobles held a meeting to discuss the [...] "problem of Darnley".

[...] Darnley feared for his safety and after the baptism of his son at Stirling shortly before Christmas, he went to Glasgow to stay on his father's estates.

[...] Neilie Johnson for IGN found that some players may <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>off</b> by the game's crudeness but otherwise [...] "it's totally random, highly creative and brutally unforgiving". Similarly, Nathan Muenier for GameSpy noted the game had some shock value that one must work past, but otherwise was [...] " [...] imaginative" [...] and [...] "utterly absorbing". Alternatively, Jordan Devore for Destructoid considered the visual style of the game one of its [...] "biggest selling points", following from McMillen's past style of dark comedy from Super Meat Boy. Baranowsky's soundtrack was found by reviewers to well-suit the themes of the game, and used appropriately to avoid extensive repetition during a playthrough. Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku called the soundtrack as the combination of several genres and the musical styles of Danny Elfman, Muse, and Final Fantasy that created something [...] "dark and unique".|$|E
