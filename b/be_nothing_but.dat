500|$|In {{this new}} society, the self-alienation would end and humans {{would be free}} to act without being bound by the labour market. It would be a {{democratic}} society, enfranchising the entire population. In such a utopian world there would also be little if any need for a state, which goal was to enforce the alienation. He theorised that between capitalism and the establishment of a socialist/communist system, a dictatorship of the proletariat—a period where the working class holds political power and forcibly socialises the means of production—would exist. As he wrote in his Critique of the Gotha Program, [...] "between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat". While he allowed for the possibility of peaceful transition in some countries with strong democratic institutional structures (such as Britain, the United States and the Netherlands), he suggested that in other countries in what workers can not [...] "attain their goal by peaceful means" [...] the [...] "lever of our revolution must be force".|$|E
500|$|The author Nicholas Tucker {{notes that}} it was common to see Blyton cited as people's {{favourite}} or least favourite author according to their age, and argues that her books create an [...] "encapsulated world for young readers that simply dissolves with age, leaving behind only memories of excitement and strong identification". Fred Inglis considers Blyton's books to be technically easy to read, but to also be [...] "emotionally and cognitively easy". He mentions that the psychologist Michael Woods believed that Blyton was different from many other older authors writing for children in that she seemed untroubled by presenting them with a world that differed from reality. Woods surmised that Blyton [...] "was a child, she thought as a child, and wrote as a child... the basic feeling is essentially pre-adolescent... Enid Blyton has no moral dilemmas... Inevitably Enid Blyton was labelled by rumour a child-hater. If true, such a fact {{should come as no}} surprise to us, for as a child herself all other children can <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> rivals for her." [...] Inglis argues though that Blyton was clearly devoted to children and put an enormous amount of energy into her work, with a powerful belief in [...] "representing the crude moral diagrams and garish fantasies of a readership". Blyton's daughter Imogen has stated that she [...] "loved a relationship with children through her books", but real children were an intrusion, and there was no room for intruders in the world that Blyton occupied through her writing.|$|E

2500|$|According to Frederick Merk, these colonial {{acquisitions}} {{marked a}} break from the original intention of manifest destiny. Previously, [...] "Manifest Destiny had contained a principle so fundamental that a Calhoun and an O'Sullivan could agree on it—that a people not capable of rising to statehood should never be annexed. That was the principle thrown overboard by the imperialism of 1899." [...] Albert J. Beveridge maintained the contrary at his September 25, 1900, speech in the Auditorium, at Chicago. He declared that the current desire for Cuba and the other acquired territories was identical to the views expressed by Washington, Jefferson and Marshall.

[...] Because HRC was so new {{at the time of}} Laudan's book, she only briefly touches upon it: [...] "I came to understand that what people in Hawaii eat is a mixture of four distinct kinds of food, introduced at distinct periods, but now all coexisting. [...] The first three reflect the three diasporas that have terminated in Hawaii: the great marine diaspora of the Pacific Islanders that probably reached the Hawaiian Islands sometime in the third century A.D..; the European voyages of discovery that finally came upon the Islands in the late eighteenth century; and the long migration of the Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Koreans, Filipinos, and lately, Southeast Asians, most of whom came to work on the plantations. [...] From these diverse traditions, a fourth, an East-West-Pacific food, is now being created, known in the Islands as Local Food. [...] But there is another cuisine in the Islands that attracts attention, Hawaii Regional Cuisine... was created by forces quite different from those that drive Local Food...although the forces creating Hawaii Regional Cuisine and Local Food were different, their current cross-fertilization can <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> mutually beneficial, creating a firm regional base for the cuisine of the restaurants and increasing sophistication for the cuisine of the home and the street." ...|$|E
2500|$|The morning {{following}} the Battle of Culloden, Cumberland issued a written order reminding his men that [...] "the public {{orders of the}} rebels yesterday was to give us no quarter". Cumberland alluded {{to the belief that}} such orders had been found upon the bodies of fallen Jacobites. In the days and weeks that followed, [...] versions of the alleged orders were published in the Newcastle Journal and the Gentleman's Journal. Today only one copy of the alleged order to [...] "give no quarter" [...] exists. It is however considered to <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a poor attempt at forgery, for it is neither written nor signed by Murray, and it appears on the bottom half of a copy of a declaration published in 1745.

On the other hand, the orders issued by Lord George Murray for the conduct of the aborted night attack {{in the early hours of}} 16 April suggest that it would have been every bit as merciless. The instructions were to use only swords, dirks and bayonets, to overturn tents, and subsequently to locate [...] "a swelling or bulge in the fallen tent, there to strike and push vigorously".

2500|$|Data {{collection}} at the LHC finally commenced in March 2010. By December 2011 the two main particle detectors at the LHC, ATLAS and CMS, had narrowed down the mass range where the Higgs could exist to around 116-130 GeV (ATLAS) and 115-127 GeV (CMS). There had also already {{been a number of}} promising event excesses that had [...] "evaporated" [...] and proven to <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> random fluctuations. However, from around May 2011, both experiments had seen among their results, the slow emergence of a small yet consistent excess of gamma and 4-lepton decay signatures and several other particle decays, all hinting at a new particle at a mass around [...] By around November 2011, the anomalous data at 125GeV was becoming [...] "too large to ignore" [...] (although still far from conclusive), and the team leaders at both ATLAS and CMS each privately suspected they might have found the Higgs. On November 28, 2011, at an internal meeting of the two team leaders and the director general of CERN, the latest analyses were discussed outside their teams for the first time, suggesting both ATLAS and CMS might be converging on a possible shared result at 125GeV, and initial preparations commenced in case of a successful finding. While this information was not known publicly at the time, the narrowing of the possible Higgs range to around 115–130 GeV and the repeated observation of small but consistent event excesses across multiple channels at both ATLAS and CMS in the 124-126 GeV region (described as [...] "tantalising hints" [...] of around 2-3 sigma) were public knowledge with [...] "a lot of interest". It was therefore widely anticipated around the end of 2011, that the LHC would provide sufficient data to either exclude or confirm the finding of a Higgs boson by the end of 2012, when their 2012 collision data (with slightly higher 8TeV collision energy) had been examined.|$|E

2500|$|Until Chamberlain's death, he and Wilhelm {{had what}} the American {{historian}} Geoffrey Field called [...] "a warm, personal bond", which was {{expressed in a}} series of [...] "....elaborate, wordy letters, full of mutual admiration and half-baked ideas". The Wilhelm-Chamberlain letters were full of [...] "the perplexing thought world of mystical and racist conservatism. They ranged far and wide in subject matter: the ennobling mission of the Germanic race, the corroding forces of Ultramontanism, materialism and the [...] "destructive poison" [...] of Judentum were favorite themes." [...] Other subjects often discussed in the Wilhelm-Chamberlain letters were the dangers posed to the Reich by the [...] "Yellow Peril", [...] "Tartarized Slavdom", and by the [...] "black hordes". In 1901, Wilhelm informed Chamberlain in a letter that: [...] "God sent your book to the German people, just as he sent you personally to me, that is my unshakably firm conviction". Wilhelm went on to praise Chamberlain as his [...] "comrade-in-arms and ally in the struggle for Teutons against Rome, Jerusalem, etc". In 1902, Wilhelm wrote another letter in which he told Chamberlain: [...] "May you save our German Volk, our Germanentum, for God has sent you as our helper!". Chamberlain in his turn advised Wilhelm to create [...] "a racially aware...centrally organised Germany with a clear sense of purpose, a Germany which would 'rule the world'". In 1903, Chamberlain wrote to Wilhelm to claim that as in the last decadent days of Rome, [...] "the civis britannicus is now become a purely political concept" [...] with no racial content being involved. Chamberlain wrote with disgust how for two shillings and a sixpence, [...] "every Basuto nigger" [...] could now carry a British passport. Chamberlain went on to predict within the next fifty years [...] "the English aristocracy will <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a money oligarchy, without a shred of racial solidarity or relation to the throne". Chamberlain went on to deplore the practice of raising businessmen to the peerage in Britain, contemptuously declaring that in Britain mere [...] "brewers, ink manufacturers and ship-owners" [...] now sat in the House of Lords. Chamberlain ended his letter to the Kaiser by calling the general British public [...] "a herd which has no will and which a few newspapers and handful of politicians manipulate as they wish". Wilhelm's later concept of [...] "Juda-England", of a decaying Britain sucked dried by Jewish capitalists owed much to Chamberlain. The Dutch journalist Ian Buruma described Chamberlain's letters to the Kaiser as pushing his [...] "…Anglophobic, anti-Semitic, Germanophile ideas to the point of murderous lunacy". The liberal Berliner Zeitung newspaper complained in an editorial of the close friendship between Wilhelm II and such an outspoken racist and anti-Semite like Chamberlain, stating this was a real cause for concern for decent, caring people both inside and outside Germany.|$|E
