5|$|Other, more {{invasive}} procedures, {{also exist}} for larger bone defects including mobilization of the inferior alveolar nerve to allow placement of a fixture, onlay <b>bone</b> <b>grafting</b> using the iliac crest or another large source of bone and microvascular bone graft where {{the blood supply}} to the bone is transplanted with the source bone and reconnected to the local blood supply. The final decision about which <b>bone</b> <b>grafting</b> technique that is best {{is based on an}} assessment of the degree of vertical and horizontal bone loss that exists, each of which is classified into mild (2–3mm loss), moderate (4–6mm loss) or severe (greater than 6mm loss). Orthodontic extrusion or orthodontic implant site development can be used in selected cases for vertical/horizontal alveolar augmentation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bone</b> <b>grafting</b> is {{necessary}} {{when there is}} a lack of bone. While there are always new implant types, such as short implants, and techniques to allow compromise, a general treatment goal is to have a minimum of 10mm in bone height, and 6mm in width. Alternatively, bone defects are graded from A to D (A=10+mm of bone, B=7–9mm, C=4–6mm and D=0–3mm) where an implant's likelihood of osseointegrating is related to the grade of bone.|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve an}} {{adequate}} width and height of bone, various <b>bone</b> <b>grafting</b> techniques have been developed. The {{most frequently used}} is called guided bone graft augmentation where a defect is filled with either natural (harvested or autograft) bone or allograft (donor bone or synthetic bone substitute), covered with a semi-permeable membrane and allowed to heal. During the healing phase, natural bone replaces the graft forming a new bony base for the implant.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Bone defects after failed total hip {{arthroplasty}} can be reconstructed with impacted morselized <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> and a cemented cup. On the acetabular side, {{the effects}} on initial cup stability of washing <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> prior to impaction and <b>bone</b> <b>graft</b> size remain unclear. Related to these variables, cement penetration and inter-particle shear resistance have been suggested to be critical factors to ensure initial cup stability. METHODS: Using a synthetic acetabular model, we studied the effects of (1) washing <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> prior to impaction, and (2) <b>bone</b> <b>graft</b> size on the initial stability of cemented cups. In addition, cement penetration was measured using CT scans. RESULTS: Reconstructions with large, washed <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> provided the highest stability during mechanical compression and in a lever-out situation. Washing of the <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> had {{a positive effect on}} initial cup stability, but the size of the <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> appeared to be more important. Cement penetration was affected by <b>bone</b> <b>graft</b> size but not by washing. INTERPRETATION: From a mechanical standpoint, large <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> that have been washed prior to impaction may be preferable in order to obtain optimal cup stability using the <b>bone</b> impaction <b>grafting</b> technique...|$|R

30|$|<b>Bone</b> <b>graft</b> is {{frequently}} accompanied with dental implant surgery [1, 8]. Various types of <b>bone</b> <b>graft</b> materials are used {{such as the}} autogenous bone, allogenic bone, xenogenic bone, and synthetic materials. The most frequently used surgical methods for <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> are guided <b>bone</b> regeneration (GBR), block <b>bone</b> <b>graft</b> (BBG), sinus lifting via lateral window, and bone-added osteotome technique. GBR procedure needs <b>bone</b> <b>graft</b> materials and a membrane for selective occlusiveness. <b>Bone</b> <b>graft</b> materials can be used solely or mixed together in different proportions [9]. Similar cases of bone defects can be treated differently according to the surgeon’s preference. Compared with dental implant surgery, <b>bone</b> <b>graft</b> procedures {{are not covered by}} the national insurance system. To be registered in the insurance system, basic data on the frequency of <b>bone</b> <b>graft</b> during implant surgery is required.

Among an estimated almost 2 million <b>bone</b> <b>graft</b> procedures (83 % autogenous, 17 % artificial), the use of both types of grafts decreased. The main diagnoses for which <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> were used did not change; however, cervical spine diseases and lower-limb fractures decreased more remarkably.

25|$|In large studies, women taking bisphosphonates for {{osteoporosis}} {{have had}} unusual fractures ("bisphosphonate fractures") in the femur (thigh bone) in the shaft (diaphysis or sub-trochanteric region) of the bone, {{rather than at}} the femoral neck, which is the most common site of fracture. However, these unusual fractures are extremely rare (12 in 14,195 women) compared to the common hip fractures (272 in 14,195 women), and the overall reduction in hip fractures caused by bisphosphonate far outweighed the unusual shaft fractures. There are concerns that long-term bisphosphonate use can result in over-suppression of bone turnover. It is hypothesized that micro-cracks in the bone are unable to heal and eventually unite and propagate, resulting in atypical fractures. Such fractures tend to heal poorly and often require some form of bone stimulation, for example <b>bone</b> <b>grafting</b> as a secondary procedure. This complication is not common, and the benefit of overall fracture reduction still holds. In cases where there is concern of such fractures occurring, teriparatide is potentially a good alternative because it does not cause as much damage as a bisphosphonate does by suppressing bone turnover.|$|E

40|$|Bone defects after failed total hip {{arthroplasty}} can be reconstructed with impacted morselized <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> and a cemented cup.

Ceramic calcium phosphates [tricalcium phosphate (TCP) and hydroxyapatite (HA) ] have been widely considered as potential <b>bone</b> <b>graft</b> substitutes or <b>bone</b> <b>graft</b> extenders. In the past, mechanical experiments have been performed to determine implant stability of <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> and ceramic TCP-HA granules mixes under a compressive load.

Twenty-seven adult New Zealand White rabbits were used as the experimental model. Autogenous <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> taken from the cranial bone (intramembranous in origin) and the femur (endochondral in origin) were grafted into skull defects created on either side of the parietal suture. Rabbits were killed on days 1 to 9 postgrafting, and the <b>bone</b> <b>graft</b> alone was harvested for immunolocalization of TIMP- 1. In endochondral <b>bone</b> <b>grafts,</b> TIMP- 1 was expressed on days 1 to 3, followed by a period of absence until days 8 and 9. Intramembranous <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> did not express TIMP- 1 until days 6 to 9. The timing and location of TIMP- 1 expression coincided with osteogenesis, which indicates a role for TIMP- 1 in preserving newly formed bone during the initial stages of graft healing. The differential temporal expression of TIMP- 1 in endochondral and intramembranous <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> suggests that <b>bone</b> <b>graft</b> type plays an important role in influencing the healing process mediated by the host tissues.
