5|$|After the trial, Kenealy instigated {{a popular}} radical reform movement, the Magna Charta Association, which championed the Claimant's cause for some years. Kenealy {{was elected to}} Parliament in 1875 as a radical {{independent}} but was not an effective parliamentarian. The movement was in decline when the Claimant was released in 1884, {{and he had no}} dealings with it. In 1895, he confessed to being Orton, only to recant almost immediately. He lived generally in poverty {{for the rest of his}} life and was destitute at the time of his death in 1898. Although most commentators have accepted the court's view that the Claimant was Orton, some analysts <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> element of doubt remains as to his true identity and that, conceivably, he was Roger Tichborne.|$|E
5|$|In February 1924, Lethbridge married Sylvia Robertson in a {{ceremony}} held at Salisbury Cathedral. Together they moved into a house known as The Lodge in Waterbeach. There, their first two sons were born: Christopher John in March 1925 and Hugh Periam in July 1926. In 1927, they moved to Mount Blow, a house in Shelford designed by architect Edwin Lutyens. It was there that Sylvia {{gave birth to a}} daughter, Belinda Mary, in April 1930. Sylvia suffered from mental illness however, resulting in repeated hospitalisation. Lethbridge meanwhile devoted much of his time to yachting around the British Isles, sometimes taking family members with him. Over the course of the 1930s he self-published a series of books featuring his own sketches and engravings of maritime scenes. He also deepened his interest in the paranormal during this period, coming to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> acquaintance of his was a genuine psychic and observing an unidentified flying object in Bracknell.|$|E

25|$|Brody {{was asked}} to join Yitzhak Yitzhaky's One Israel party in 1980, after he retired. But he {{rejected}} the offer. He did not view himself as a politician, and was not seeking a political career. Though he joined the Likud party in the 1990s, he was not openly active in politics because he didn't <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> active sportsman should involve himself in politics.|$|E
25|$|There have {{occasionally}} been {{proposals to}} abolish the monarchy and establish a republic. Unlike its neighbour Australia, New Zealand has not yet held {{a referendum on the}} matter, but a number of prominent politicians (including the former Prime Minister, John Key) <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> eventual move to republicanism is inevitable. Opinion polls, however, have shown that a majority of New Zealanders favour keeping the monarchy.|$|E

25|$|Carrie convinces Saul to put Allison under surveillance, {{despite the}} fact that he and Allison are in a relationship. They then lead her to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> SVR chief has {{defected}} to the U.S., and that he has documents revealing how the CIA had been infiltrated. Allison panics and goes to her handler, Ivan Krupin (Mark Ivanir), which allows the CIA to put her under arrest. Carrie then sees a news report showing video of Islamic State terrorists poisoning Quinn with sarin, and threatening to unleash a chemical attack on a major European city in 24 hours. Carrie traces the video to an address in Berlin, where she finds Quinn, barely alive. Quinn ultimately lives, but is left in a coma.|$|E
25|$|A {{publicist}} by profession, {{famed for}} inventing {{some of the}} most ingenious advertising slogans of his time, O’Neill was unusually adept at manipulating words and using them in an efficacious manner, but he refused to put that talent at the service of a lyrically lofty, feel-good sort of poetry (see ‘Simply Expressive’). Stridently anti-Romantic, concerned to keep humanity in its place as just one of earth’s species, he did not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> especially harmonious world was possible, and he abhorred all attempts to escape the world, whether through mystical or poetical exaltations. His one hope, or consolation, explicitly stated in ‘St. Francis’s Empty Sandal’, was in the connection (never entirely peaceful) he felt {{with other members of the}} species.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} week after the coup, the Australia's {{military}} response was limited to maintaining the naval vessels at or near Fiji and suspending aid to the RFMF provided under the Defence Cooperation Program. The naval vessels ships provided secure communications between the Australian High Commission in Suva and a means of evacuating Australian nationals if the situation worsened. While the Government did not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> evacuation would become necessary, the ship Stalwart docked at Suva and ships Adelaide and Sydney docked at Lautoka. They all remained docked after their diplomatic clearance expired on 18 May, leaving only on 20 May after the Fijian Governor-General's office ordered then to depart. Stalwart, Adelaide and Sydney subsequently cruised just outside Fiji's territorial waters.|$|E

25|$|In {{the report}} Fireman Sim Webb {{states that he}} heard the torpedo explode, {{then went to the}} gangway on the engineer's side and saw the flagman with the red and white lights {{standing}} alongside the tracks. Going to the fireman's side, he saw the markers of the caboose of No. 83 and yelled to Jones. But it would have been impossible for him to have seen the flagman if the flagman had been positioned 500–800 feet (150–240 m) before the torpedoes as the report says he was. In any event, some railroad historians have disputed the official account over the years, finding it difficult if not impossible to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> engineer of Jones' experience would have ignored a flagman and fusees (flares) and torpedoes exploded on the rail to alert him to danger.|$|E
25|$|His {{correspondence}} {{reveals that}} despite his clear dislike for British subjugation, {{he was deeply}} impressed by their methodical and systematic approach and their steadfastly disciplinarian outlook towards life. In England, he exchanged ideas {{on the future of}} India with British Labour Party leaders and political thinkers like Lord Halifax, George Lansbury, Clement Attlee, Arthur Greenwood, Harold Laski, J.B.S. Haldane, Ivor Jennings, G.D.H. Cole, Gilbert Murray and Sir Stafford Cripps. He came to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> independent India needed socialist authoritarianism, on the lines of Turkey's Kemal Atatürk, for at least two decades. For politically reasons Bose was refused permission by the British authorities to meet Atatürk at Ankara. During his sojourn in England Bose tried to schedule appointments but only the Labour Party and Liberal politicians agreed to meet with him. Conservative Party officials refused to meet him or show him courtesy because he was a politician coming from a colony. In the 1930s leading figures in the Conservative Party had opposed even Dominion status for India. It was during the Labour Party government of 1945–1951, with Attlee as the Prime Minister, that India gained independence.|$|E
500|$|In a 1994 interview, Lucian Pintilie {{expanded}} on {{the issues}} central to the film by drawing a parallel with his own childhood in a multi-ethnic part of Bessarabia. He noted that, before World War II's Operation Barbarossa, when Nazi German troops began rounding up and executing members of various communities, the region did not experience [...] "racial tension". Despite his fondness for the interwar period, the director added: [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> artist {{should not be a}} hostage to his own political convictions. If the Romanians are shown as intolerant, at least once, it has to be discussed. Each person, in this ethnic madness, must clean his own doorstep." ...|$|E

[...] On March 23, 2015, police noted that Jackie refused to cooperate with law enforcement during the investigation.

500|$|Many of the German radar {{stations}} on the French coast {{were destroyed}} {{in preparation for}} the landings. In addition, on the night before the invasion, a small group of Special Air Service (SAS) operators deployed dummy paratroopers over Le Havre and Isigny. These dummies led the Germans to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> additional airborne landing had occurred. On that same night, in Operation Taxable, No. 617 Squadron RAF dropped strips of [...] "window", metal foil that caused a radar return which was mistakenly interpreted by German radar operators as a naval convoy near Le Havre. The illusion was bolstered by a group of small vessels towing barrage balloons. A similar deception was undertaken near Boulogne-sur-Mer in the Pas de Calais area by No. 218 Squadron RAF in Operation Glimmer.|$|E
500|$|Raëlians do not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> {{ethereal}} soul exists free {{of physical}} confinement.

People excluded from physical re-creation would include those who achieved nothing positive but were not evil. [...] Vorilhon expressed an interest in cloning Hitler for war trials and retroactive punishment. [...] Raël also mentioned cloning as the solution to terrorism by suicide attacks, as the perpetrators {{would not be able to}} escape punishment by killing themselves if the Elohim recreated them after their attacks.|$|E
