The final word {{in the book is}} the {{negative}} [...] "myself", a word that signifies Angelou's new-found freedom and independence. Angelou has become truly herself and is no longer defined as someone's wife or mother.

Angelou and Make never marry, {{but she and}} Guy {{move with}} Make to London and Cairo, where she acts as his {{political}} wife while he is in exile. Their relationship is full of cultural conflicts; he expects {{her to be a}} subservient African wife, and she yearns for the freedom of a working woman. She learns that Make is too friendly with other women and is irresponsible with money, so she accepts a position as assistant editor at the Arab Observer. Their relationship is examined by their community of friends, and Angelou and Make eventually separate. Angelou accepts a job in Liberia, and she and Guy travel to Accra, where he has been accepted to attend college. Guy is seriously injured in an automobile accident, so she begins working at the University of Ghana and remains there while he recuperates. The Heart of a Woman ends with Guy leaving for college and Angelou remarking to herself, [...] "At last, I'll <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> the whole breast of a roast chicken by myself." ...|$|E
