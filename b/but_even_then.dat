5|$|Although Charles Holden had {{gradually}} reduced his workload, he {{was still}} continuing {{to go into the}} office three days per week during the early 1950s. He did not formally retire until 1958, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> he visited occasionally. Margaret Holden died in 1954 after a protracted illness which had left her nearly blind since the mid-1940s. In the last decade of his life, Holden was himself physically weaker and was looked after by his niece Minnie Green.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{groups may}} split {{up when they}} become so large that {{competition}} for resources is problematic, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>then,</b> members of matrilines tend to stick together. Dominant females procure more food, matings, and supporters. Among olive baboons in Tanzania, high-ranking females give birth at shorter intervals to infants with a higher survival rate, and their daughters tend to mature faster than low-ranking females. However, these high-ranking females also {{appear to have a}} higher probability of miscarriages and some high-ranking matrilines have inexplicably low fertility. One theory suggests this occurs due to stress on the high-ranking females, although this theory is controversial.|$|E
5|$|After an {{intensive}} planning, maintenance, and briefing period, {{the mission was}} scheduled for January 1, 1967. Poor weather caused a 24-hour delay, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>then,</b> a solid overcast covered the North Vietnamese airbases at Phúc Yên, Gia Lam, Kép, and Cat Bai when the bogus strike force began arriving over the target area, five-minute intervals separating the flights of F-4s. Leading the first flight, Olds overflew the primary MiG-21 base at Phúc Yên and was on a second pass when MiGs finally began popping up through the cloud base. Although at first seemingly random in nature, it quickly {{became apparent that the}} MiGs were ground-controlled intercepts designed to place the supposed F-105s in a vise between enemies to their front and rear.|$|E

5|$|Littorio was {{inactive}} for {{the first}} six months of 1943 due to severe fuel shortages in the Italian Navy. Only enough fuel was available for Littorio, Vittorio Veneto and their recently commissioned sister , <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> the fuel was only enough for emergencies. On 19 June 1943, an American bombing raid targeted the harbor at La Spezia and hit Littorio with three bombs. She was renamed Italia on 30 July after the government of Benito Mussolini fell from power. On 3 September, Italy signed an armistice with the Allies, ending her active participation in World War II. Six days later, Italia and the rest of the Italian fleet sailed for Malta, where they would be interned for the remainder of the war. While en route, the German Luftwaffe (Air Force) attacked the Italian fleet using Dornier Do 217s armed with Fritz X radio-controlled bombs. One Fritz X hit Italia just forward of turret no. 1; it passed through the ship and exited the hull, exploding in the water beneath and causing serious damage. Roma was meanwhile sunk in the attack.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{studying}} the horses rate their body condition {{on a scale}} of one (excellent) to five (very poor), based mainly on estimated weight and muscle tone. The horses tend to remain in above average condition, despite the harsh environment in which they live, with stallions generally averaging better condition then mares. During severe droughts, the average body score decreases, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> horses are found with moderate body scores and the entire population is never in very poor condition. The condition of the horses is directly correlated to rainfall, through a correlation to available forage, though temperature, distance between forage and water and individual energy expenditures also play a role. Studies during the 1990s found no evidence of equine disease among the population and few external parasites. Investigations of carcasses found four internal nematode parasites present (strongyles, small and large pinworms and Ascarids), as well as the larvae of botflys.|$|E
5|$|The {{miniature}} Enterprise {{was again}} {{used for the}} spacewalk sequence. Even on the large model, {{it was hard to}} make the miniature appear realistic in extreme close-up shots. To make the pullback shot work, the camera had to be within one-eighth of an inch from the model. Painter Kim Smith spent several days on a tiny area of the model to add enough surface detail for the close-up, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> the focus was barely adequate. To compensate, the crew used a wider-angle lens and shot at the highest f-stop they could. The live-action scenes of the spacewalking crew were then digitally added. Wide shots used footage of photo doubles walking across a large bluescreen draped across ILM's parking lot at night.|$|E
50|$|The {{beginnings}} of the postal history of Tonga {{can be traced to}} the Wesleyan missionaries, who landed in the islands in 1826, and sent regular communications back to London and Sydney from the day of their arrival.

25|$|In June 1944, Gustaf Mannerheim, {{to ensure}} German support while a major Soviet {{offensive}} was threatening Finland, thought {{it necessary to}} agree to the pact the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop demanded. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> Mannerheim managed to distance himself from the pact, and it fell to President Risto Ryti to sign it, so it {{came to be known as}} the Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement. This allowed Mannerheim to revoke the agreement upon the resignation of President Ryti at the start of August 1944. Mannerheim succeeded Ryti as president.|$|E

50|$|The William Wakefield Memorial {{is a rare}} New Zealand {{example of}} an early {{memorial}} commemorating {{one of the original}} European settlers.

Originally placed in the Basin Reserve, it was relocated to outside the cricket ground, before being restored in 2006 by Wellington City Council and placed close to its original location.|$|R
25|$|Aristotle wrote a work On the Pythagoreans, {{which is}} no longer extant. Some of it may be {{available}} in the Protrepticus. Aristotle's disciples Dicaearchus, Aristoxenus, and Heraclides Ponticus also wrote on the same subject. These writers were among the best sources from whom Porphyry and Iamblichus drew, while still adding some legendary accounts and their own inventions to the mix. Hence, historians are often reduced to considering the statements based on their inherent probability, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>then,</b> if all the credible stories concerning Pythagoras were supposed true, his range of activity would be impossibly vast.|$|E
25|$|The {{annual mean}} {{precipitation}} in pinyon-juniper woodlands of the southwestern United States varies widely, depending on elevation, topography, and geography. Precipitation ranges from 10inches (254mm) at low elevations to 22inches (559mm) at high elevations. Spring and summer are times of drought, and Colorado pinyon and juniper are highly drought resistant. Snow depths are not great, except at higher elevations and northern latitudes, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>then,</b> melting occurs {{within a few}} days, especially on south-facing slopes. Ponderosa pine forests in the western United States experience extreme variations in precipitation, receiving no snow some years and up to 100inches (2,540mm) in other years. Heavy spring snowfall in both habitats can create difficult nesting conditions for pinyon jays.|$|E
25|$|The {{region of}} the Tombs is also {{the home of the}} Shrike, a menacing half-mechanical, half-organic four armed {{creature}} that features prominently in the series. It appears in all four Hyperion Cantos books and is an enigma in the initial two; its purpose is not revealed until the second book, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> left somewhat nebulous. The Shrike appears to act both autonomously and as a servant of some unknown force or entity. In the first two Hyperion books, it exists solely in the area around the Time Tombs on the planet Hyperion. Its portrayal is changed significantly in the last two books, Endymion and The Rise of Endymion. In these novels, the Shrike appears effectively unfettered and protects the heroine Aenea against assassins of the opposing TechnoCore.|$|E

Tao Qian died in the same year, leaving his province to Liu Bei. A year later, in 195, Cao Cao managed to drive Lü Bu out of Yan Province. Lü Bu fled to Xu Province and was received by Liu Bei, and an uneasy alliance began between the two.|$|E
25|$|In 1810 the {{government}} of the Qing Dynasty issued a pardon to all pirates operating in China, thousands accepted and joined the Qing navy which began the decline of piracy in the Far East. However, though many pirates chose to give up their criminal ways, thousands continued pirating along the southern Chinese coast. The pirates used war-junks and occasionally other vessels as well. Several different pirate groups were active in this time and they usually operated in mass against merchant vessels. By 1847 the Royal Navy began to take more serious measures against the pirates. They had already engaged the Chinese brigands in combat as early as 1839 and it took until the late 1860s to finally put an end to fleets of pirate junks <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> piracy continued in China but was done so in a different way as new steam vessels meant a change in tactics.|$|E
25|$|There were exceptions, of course. The {{first person}} known to {{publicly}} {{address this issue}} was Bob Bemer, who had noticed it in 1958 {{as a result of}} work on genealogical software. He spent the next twenty years trying to make programmers, IBM, the government of the United States and the ISO aware of the problem, with little result. This included the recommendation that the COBOL PICTURE clause should be used to specify four digit years for dates. Despite magazine articles on the subject from 1970 onward, the majority of programmers and managers only started recognising Y2K as a looming problem in the mid-1990s, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>then,</b> inertia and complacency caused it to be mostly unresolved until the last few years of the decade.

40|$|Determinism seems {{incompatible}} with free will. However, even indeterminism seems {{incompatible with}} free will, since {{it seems to}} make free actions random.
