5|$|Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson sees Vivienne Michel as {{the best}} {{realised}} female characterisation undertaken by Fleming, partly because {{the story is told}} in the first person narrative. Academic Jeremy Black notes that Michel is the closest Fleming gets to kitchen sink realism in the Bond canon: she has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of life in the past, but is wilful and tough, too.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Vyacheslav Nikonov {{was charged}} by the Russian {{government}} with investigating Wallenberg's fate. He concluded that Wallenberg died in 1947, executed while a prisoner in Lubyanka. He may have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of the C-2 poison (carbylamine-choline-chloride) tested at the poison laboratory of the Soviet secret services.|$|E
5|$|It is {{impossible}} to judge the truth of these diary entries, but Reich's second daughter, the psychiatrist Lore Reich Rubin, told Christopher Turner that she believed Reich had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of child sexual abuse, and that this explained his lifelong interest in sex and childhood sexuality.|$|E

5000|$|Because you {{are very}} afraid, you are not sure if you <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> or you <b>are</b> not <b>a</b> <b>victim,</b> you don't become aware if you <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim,</b> if you knew that you <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim,</b> you would ask for help immediately. Social myth is [...] "Why don't these women who are locked up ask for help at the time? Why don't they come out {{screaming}} {{that they are in}} these places where they are being exploited sexually, if as a society we know this is wrong?" [...] Because the victims do not know, because they have a great ignorance about international treaties signed by our country, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> great ignorance that our country is abolitionist.|$|R
5|$|Two unassisted triple plays {{were turned}} at Forbes Field. The first {{took place on}} May 7, 1925, when Pittsburgh's Glenn Wright {{achieved}} the feat. Two seasons later, in 1927, Jimmy Cooney—who had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of the first triple play—also acquired three outs by himself.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, the {{investigations}} into the disappearance of De Mauro by the Carabinieri and the police followed widely divergent leads. Colonel Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa and Captain Giuseppe Russo of the Carabinieri {{were among the first}} to work on his case. Years later, and in different circumstances, both were murdered by the Mafia. They focused on the lead of drug trafficking. According to them, the journalist would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of lupara bianca after discovering leads on drug trafficking by the Mafia between Sicily and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{had to wait}} a {{month for}} his next victory on 23 December 1940. Kampfgeschwader 1 (KG 1) sent 100 bombers led by Kampfgruppe 100 to attack Manchester. GCI {{vectored}} Cunningham onto the enemy aircraft. It was not yet dark and Cunningham identified the machine as a Heinkel He 111. Flying at 15,000 feet, he saw the Heinkel above the Beaufighter at 16,500 feet. Cunningham engaged the enemy 50 miles south of West Lulworth. The enemy climbed to 19,000 feet. Following, Cunningham opened fire at 200–300 yards. The He 111 was engulfed in fire. The bomber was high enough for the crew to jettison the bombs and incendiaries and glide to France where it crash-landed at Cherbourg. Two of Feldwebel Georg Deininger's crew were wounded. The 3./KGr 100 machine was written off. The crew were unaware they had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of a night-fighter. They supposed they had been shot down by a flak ship.|$|E

5|$|Marsden first {{arrives in}} Albert Square in March 2001, {{investigating}} Phil Mitchell's shooting {{in her first}} case as detective chief inspector. She identifies the five main suspects: Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) and Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin). Marsden arrests Dan for the shooting, although he is later acquitted {{due to lack of}} evidence. Dan was set up by Phil but it was, in fact, Lisa who shot him. Marsden later arrests Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth) for the attempted murder of her husband Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns). Little Mo claims self-defence, since she has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of domestic violence at the hands of Trevor. The trial ends, with Trevor's treatment of Little Mo revealed. In 2003, Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) visits Marsden with evidence that Phil killed his ex-girlfriend Lisa. Jill helps set up a honey-trap for Phil in order to obtain a confession from him, with PC Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny) and DI Dominic Price (Paul Brennen), but it fails when Kate falls in love with Phil and Marsden fires her. Marsden arrests Phil, but with insufficient evidence and no confession he is released. It later emerges that Lisa is safe and well, and Phil is innocent. Marsden later arrests Phil when Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) set him up in an armed robbery.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} death {{remained}} uncertain until 10 years after {{the discovery of the}} body. It was initially believed that Ötzi died from exposure during a winter storm. Later it was speculated that Ötzi might have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of a ritual sacrifice, perhaps for being a chieftain. This explanation was inspired by theories previously advanced for the first millennium BCE bodies recovered from peat bogs such as the Tollund Man and the Lindow Man.|$|E
