5|$|Due to the {{configuration}} of the Circuit de Monaco, with its low average speed and abundance of low-speed corners, allied to the low-grip nature of the public road surface, the teams all set their cars up to produce the maximum amount of downforce and mechanical grip possible. Benetton modified their car's suspensions to work <b>better</b> <b>on</b> the circuit's low-speed corners. The Minardi cars came equipped with a new titanium cast gearbox and new rear suspensions. McLaren brought an additional spare car to the event, with four in total being shared between Häkkinen and Coulthard.|$|E

Preceding their first tour with DJ Lethal, Otto became familiar with Lethal's contributions {{to collaborate with}} him <b>better</b> <b>on</b> stage. In addition to touring with Primus and Deftones, Limp Bizkit headlined the Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour, which was intended to diversify the band's fanbase, which was largely male, by offering free tickets to female attendees. This plan successfully increased the band's female fanbase.|$|E
5|$|Nowitzki is a {{versatile}} frontcourt player who mostly plays the power forward position, but has also played center and small forward throughout his career.

In the 2006–07 season, Nowitzki became only the fifth member of the NBA's 50–40–90 Club for players who shot 50% or better from the field, 40% or <b>better</b> <b>on</b> three-pointers, and 90% or <b>better</b> <b>on</b> free-throws in a single season while achieving the NBA league minimum number of makes in each category.|$|E

5|$|Dance Again... the Hits enjoyed {{moderate}} {{commercial success}} in the United States, peaking at number 20 on the Billboard 200 the week of its debut with sales of 14,000 copies. The album performed <b>better</b> <b>on</b> the Billboard R/Hip-Hop Albums component chart, where it managed to reach number six. Dance Again... the Hits performed significantly lower on the Billboard 200 than Lopez's seventh studio album Love?, which peaked at number five, {{as well as her}} previous compilation album J to tha L–O! The Remixes (2002), which peaked at number one. After a month, the album had sold 38,000 copies in the United States. As of December 2012, Dance Again... the Hits is Lopez's second lowest performing album in the country; only The Reel Me achieved a lower chart position in 2003, peaking at number 69. On the UK Albums Chart, Dance Again... the Hits debuted at number four with sales of 9,213 copies in its first week of release, matching the peak of J to Tha L-O!: The Remixes in that country.|$|E
5|$|Football on the Pacific Coast {{had been}} on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be <b>better</b> <b>on</b> the Pacific coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the Pacific coast would be much better for a man of my age and in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E

They also performed much <b>better</b> <b>on</b> a problem-solving task than learners whose lessons included the seductive details. Harper and Mayer suggested seductive details do their damage when learners are consolidating and organizing new information by forming knowledge structures ill-suited for later recall.|$|E
5|$|In August 1940, Berger reorganised the SS-HA {{to focus}} <b>better</b> <b>on</b> its main role of {{recruiting}} for the Waffen-SS, creating separate sections {{to deal with}} recruiting {{inside and outside the}} Reich. The section targeting recruits from outside of the Reich developed out of a briefing he received from the Chief of the SS-Führungshauptamt (SS Command Main Office, or SS-FHA) SS-Brigadeführer Hans Jüttner on Hitler's expectations of the Waffen-SS for the upcoming invasion of the Soviet Union, which included the raising of a fourth division and the expansion of the LSSAH to a motorised brigade. Berger realised that the Wehrmacht quotas for the Waffen-SS would fall short of its manpower needs by at least 6,000 per year.|$|E

Following Destiny's Child reunion performance at the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show on February 3, 2013, the compilation climbed to number 66 on the iTunes Albums chart.|$|E
5|$|Their {{frustration}} clearly apparent, the Virginia Tech offense fared no <b>better</b> <b>on</b> {{their next}} possession. Two plays were stopped for no gain, {{and the only}} positive play—a five-yard pass to Eddie Royal—was negated by a false start penalty. The Hokies were again forced to punt the ball away to Florida State, their fifth of the game. The punt allowed FSU to start at their own 46-yard line, and at first, the Seminoles were able to capitalize on that opportunity, showing some of the effectiveness that characterized their prior drive. Lorenzo Booker ran for 24yards on two plays, but afterwards, Drew Weatherford threw two incompletions. A false start penalty backed up the Seminoles, who were forced to punt after failing {{to pick up the}} first down. The kick was an excellent one, and Florida State's special teams were able to get downfield and stop the ball inside the Virginia Tech one-yard line, again hurting the Hokie offense.|$|E

5|$|Worldwide, {{the game}} sold nearly two million units {{in its first}} three weeks of release, and had sold 2.5 million {{by the end of}} September 2009. According to NPD Group, Batman: Arkham Asylum sold {{approximately}} 593,000 units in North America during the five tracked days following its release on August 25. By December 2009, the PlayStation 3 version of the game had outsold the Xbox 360 version by approximately 10,000 units despite multi-platform titles typically selling <b>better</b> <b>on</b> the Xbox 360 at the time. The exclusive content featuring the Joker as a playable character was cited as a possible reason for the success of the PlayStation 3 version. The game took two of the top five spots on the US software chart in its first week of release, and topped the UK all-format chart for two weeks.|$|E
5|$|The Gamezebo {{reviewer}} {{had special}} {{praise for the}} game's sound design {{and how it was}} used to clue the player into puzzle solutions. TouchArcade commended how the game's sparse story unfolded by watching the assassination targets go about their time at the compound. The reviewer also noted that his suspension of disbelief was broken when characters would eventually return to partying after reacting to a gunshot, but suggested that the game's Easter eggs redeemed its psychopathic qualities. Pocket Gamer wrote that the game did not reach the heights of the series' situational humor in hiding bodies stealthily. Other criticism included Gamezebo, which blamed the game's core multiplier ability for breaking the balance of the game. TouchArcade thought that the game played <b>better</b> <b>on</b> the tablet iPad than on the smaller iPhone, and praised the feature that synced game progress, since Apple's iCloud service was known for its struggle to successfully implement the same feature. Despite Square Enix Montreal being best known for its Go series, Hitman: Sniper was the studio's biggest revenue generator. As its most lucrative title, the game helped to fund the development of the Go series.|$|E
5|$|The Via Panisperna boys {{also noticed}} some unexplained effects. The {{experiment}} {{seemed to work}} <b>better</b> <b>on</b> a wooden table than a marble table top. Fermi remembered that Joliot-Curie and Chadwick had noted that paraffin wax was effective at slowing neutrons, {{so he decided to}} try that. When neutrons were passed through paraffin wax, they induced a hundred times as much radioactivity in silver compared with when it was bombarded without the paraffin. Fermi guessed that this was due to the hydrogen atoms in the paraffin. Those in wood similarly explained the difference between the wooden and the marble table tops. This was confirmed by repeating the effect with water. He concluded that collisions with hydrogen atoms slowed the neutrons. The lower the atomic number of the nucleus it collides with, the more energy a neutron loses per collision, and therefore the less collisions that are required to slow a neutron down by a given amount. Fermi realised that this induced more radioactivity because slow neutrons were more easily captured than fast ones. He developed a diffusion equation to describe this, which became known as the Fermi age equation.|$|E
