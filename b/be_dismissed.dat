5|$|Boycott's ODI {{career was}} noticeably less {{productive}} than his Test. He did, however, face the first One Day International ball ever bowled, {{and was the}} first batsman to <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> in what was the first ever ODI game. The match, considered a one-off at the time due to ODI cricket being in its infancy, was hastily arranged to cover a washed out 1970-71 Ashes Test.|$|E
5|$|For his part, Thompson said {{he thought}} the judge was trying to protect Moore's {{criminal}} conviction at any cost. He also complained about the judge's ethics, saying a local attorney who claimed to have influence on the judge had assured him the case would <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> unless the attorney was on Thompson's team, and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website.|$|E

5000|$|Napper made {{a single}} {{first-class}} appearance for Sussex against England at Trent Bridge at the Royal New Ground, Brighton in 1838. [...] Sussex <b>were</b> <b>dismissed</b> for 72 in their first-innings, with Napper scoring 8 runs before he <b>was</b> <b>dismissed</b> by William Hillyer and in response, England <b>were</b> <b>dismissed</b> for 67. In Sussex's second-innings, Napper contributed 7 runs to Sussex's total of 129, with James Cobbett <b>dismissing</b> him.

5|$|However, he {{recovered}} {{to be selected}} for the First Test at Edgbaston, just five days later. He made 82 as Australia scored 9/516 declared and took a 321-run first innings lead, but England could not <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> in the second innings and salvaged a draw. He continued his form with an unbeaten 104 against Kent between the Tests.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, a cinema {{owner in}} Brighton persuaded Hendry to lend him the films, {{so as to}} screen the episodes for profit while the Panopticon VI {{convention}} was being held in the town. Saied Marham, an associate of Hendry's, visited Panopticon to generate interest in the showing, only to <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> as a hoaxster, and the screening did not go ahead.|$|E
5|$|The White House {{travel office}} controversy, {{sometimes}} referred to as Travelgate, was the first major ethics controversy of the Clinton administration. It began in May 1993, when seven employees of the White House Travel Office were fired. This action was unusual because although theoretically staff employees serve at the pleasure of the President and could <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> without cause, in practice, such employees usually remain in their posts for many years.|$|E
5000|$|Edwards made {{a single}} {{first-class}} appearance for Sussex against Lancashire at the County Ground, Hove in 1885. [...] He <b>was</b> <b>dismissed</b> for a duck twice in this match.

[...] This {{was his only}} major appearance for Sussex.|$|R
5000|$|Moody made {{a single}} {{first-class}} appearance for Sussex against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in 1843. [...] Nottinghamshire <b>were</b> <b>dismissed</b> for 326 in their first-innings, with Moody bowling 2 wicketless overs. In response Sussex <b>were</b> <b>dismissed</b> for just 33, with Moody being dismissed for a duck by Sam Redgate. Following-on, Moody {{came in at}} number three and <b>was</b> <b>dismissed</b> for 3 runs by William Clarke. Sussex <b>were</b> <b>dismissed</b> for 262 in their second-innings, thanks to 92 from Charles Hammond and 95 from Charles Hawkins. This total was enough for Sussex to draw the match.|$|R

5|$|Zenobia: {{the wife}} of Odaenathus was accused by the Augustan History of having {{formerly}} conspired with Maeonius, as Hairan I was her stepson {{and she could not}} accept that he was the heir to her husband instead of her own children. However, there is no suggestion in the Augustan History that Zenobia was involved in the event that saw her husband's murder; the act is attributed to Maeonius' degeneracy and jealousy. Those accounts by the Augustan History can <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> as fiction. The hints in modern scholarship that Zenobia had a hand in the assassination out of her desire to rule the empire and dismay with her husband's pro-Roman policy can <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> as there was no reversal of that policy during the first years following Odaenathus' death.|$|E
5|$|Anwar {{made his}} Test debut against the West Indies in a match {{where he was}} {{dismissed}} without scoring in either innings at the Iqbal Stadium, Faisalabad in 1990. His first Test century came against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve, Wellington in 1994. His highest Test score of 188 not out came against India during the 1998–99 Asian Test Championship at the Eden Gardens, Kolkata in February 1999. In the same innings, he became the third Pakistan opening batsman not to <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> {{at the close of}} an innings. Anwar scored Test centuries against seven different opponents at ten cricket grounds, including seven at venues outside Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|Artur Gustav Martin Phleps (29 November 1881– 21 September 1944) was an Austro-Hungarian, Romanian and German {{army officer}} {{who held the}} rank of SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS (lieutenant general) in the Waffen-SS during World War II. An Austro-Hungarian Army officer before and during World War I, he {{specialised}} in mountain warfare and logistics, and had been promoted to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) {{by the end of}} the war. During the interwar period he joined the Romanian Army, reaching the rank of General-locotenent (major general), and also became an adviser to King Carol. After he spoke out against the government, he was sidelined and asked to <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> from the army.|$|E

5|$|At the school, the {{fatalities}} {{resulted from}} {{the collapse of a}} concrete block wall. One hallway completely collapsed, trapping many students in the rubble of the hallway known as 3rd Hall. The tornado at the school was so strong that it tossed and mangled cars in the parking lot, flattened parts of the stadium and tore trees out of the ground. School buses were there for an early dismissal due to the storms at just after 1:00pm, but the tornado hit before the school could <b>be</b> <b>dismissed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Australia {{travelled}} to Bramall Lane {{under the}} captaincy of Miller. Captain Hassett and his deputy Morris were rested {{and stayed in}} London with the team manager. After the first day's play, he organised a party for that lasted until the next afternoon—the rest day. He woke up with a hangover the next day just minutes {{before the start of}} play. Improvising, Miller arrived at the ground in a hearse. When it was Australia's turn to bat, Miller was the last man to <b>be</b> <b>dismissed,</b> having scored 86 despite his hangover.|$|E
5|$|Desmond Haynes was {{the fourth}} man to <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> for {{handling}} the ball in Test cricket, {{just over a year}} after Mohsin. Facing India in late 1983, Haynes had been struck on the bat and pad by the ball, which then headed towards the stumps. The West Indian batsman redirected the ball away from the stumps with his free hand. Upon being given out, Haynes—who was ignorant of the law regarding handling the ball—argued with the umpire about the dismissal. After asking the bowler, Kapil Dev, if he wanted to withdraw his appeal, the umpire sent Haynes back to the pavilion. The first instance in One Day Internationals was in 1986, when the Indian batsman Mohinder Amarnath knocked away a turning delivery from Australia's Greg Matthews that was heading for the stumps. In 1993, Graham Gooch became the only player to <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> for handling the ball after scoring a century. Playing defensively to try and draw the Test match against Australia, Gooch blocked a short ball from Merv Hughes. The ball flicked off his bat and fell towards his stumps, prompting Gooch to instinctively punch the ball away: Australia won the match by 179 runs.|$|E

England <b>were</b> <b>dismissed</b> for 88 in their second-innings, leaving Sussex {{a target of}} 189 to chase. Sussex could only make 124 in their chase, with Willis being run out for 2.|$|R
5|$|In early 1922, he {{made his}} Sheffield Shield debut against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. He batted at No. 8 and made an unbeaten 22. Batting at No. 7 in his second match against Western Australia, Woodfull {{registered}} his maiden first-class century with 153. He was run out in his second and final innings of his debut first-class season, so he was yet to <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> by a bowler. Both matches were won by an innings, part of a dominant summer for the Victorians. During this time, he also studied for an arts degree at night {{in addition to his}} post at Williamstown High School.|$|E
5|$|Leg before wicket (lbw) {{is one of}} {{the ways}} in which a batsman can <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> in the sport of cricket. Following an appeal by the fielding side, the umpire may rule a batsman out lbw if the ball would have struck the wicket, but was instead intercepted by any part of the batsman's body (except the hand holding the bat). The umpire's {{decision}} will depend on a number of criteria, including where the ball pitched, whether the ball hit in line with the wickets, and whether the batsman was attempting to hit the ball.|$|E
5|$|On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven {{employees}} of the White House Travel Office, causing the White House travel office controversy even though the travel office staff served {{at the pleasure of}} the president and could <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation. Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.|$|E

5|$|The Australian cricket team toured England in 1930. Australia won the five-Test series 2–1, and Donald Bradman scored 974 runs at a {{batting average}} of 139.14, an {{aggregate}} record that still stands in 2017. By {{the time of}} the next Ashes series of 1932–33, Bradman's average hovered around 100, approximately twice that of all other world-class batsmen. The English cricket authorities felt that new tactics would be required to prevent Bradman being even more successful on Australian pitches; some critics believed that Bradman could <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> by leg-spin as Walter Robins and Ian Peebles had supposedly caused him problems; two leg-spinners were included in the English touring party of 1932–33.|$|E

5|$|The dodos on this islet may not {{necessarily}} {{have been the last}} members of the species. The last claimed sighting of a dodo was reported in the hunting records of Isaac Johannes Lamotius in 1688. Statistical analysis of these records by Roberts and Solow gives a new estimated extinction date of 1693, with a 95% confidence interval of 1688–1715. The authors also pointed out that because the last sighting before 1662 was in 1638, the dodo was probably already quite rare by the 1660s, and thus a disputed report from 1674 by an escaped slave cannot <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> out of hand.|$|E
