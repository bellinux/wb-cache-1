40|$|Soft {{soils are}} often {{associated}} with low shear strength and high water content {{and many of them}} show large time dependent deformations when structures like road embankments are constructed over them. The generation of excess pwp and settlement continues {{for a long time after}} the end of construction. The excessive ground deformations in such soils, causes severe damage to pavements and or related structures and has been a great concern to the geotechnical engineers in designing and maintaining these structures. Despite that, due to rapid growth of infrastructure and transpiration development and environmental considerations, the necessity of constructing road embankments and other structures on such soils is common. To facilitate design, construction and maintenance, predicting the multiple <b>behavirour</b> characteristics of these structures accurately is a necessity and is often a challenge. This is partly due to the complexities in the constitutive models and partly due to some other modeling aspects in the analysis. To address this challenge, a new, relatively simple, elastic viscoplastic (EVP) model has been developed in this thesis. This model is then tested against well instrumented field cases. Some other important aspects of modeling the behaviour of PVD improved soft soils and structures constructed over them have also been dealt with. To describe the behaviour of soft soils, a number of EVP models have been proposed in the literature. Many of them use a constant creep coefficient to incorporate time dependency in their mathematical formulations. However, according to many researchers, the plot of void ratio or vertical strain against log (time) may not be a straight line and thus, the creep coefficient may not be a constant. The use of a constant coefficient in the calculation may yield misleading results. Based on long duration (more than 3 months) creep tests, a new EVP model has been proposed in this thesis which allows the non linear variation of the creep coefficient. The new model also incorporates a new yield surface function developed based on effective stress path of undrained triaxial test results. The performance of the model is then tested against long duration field monitoring data from a well instrumented case history (i. e., Leneghans embankment) both in one and two dimensional analyses. The predictions obtained from the newly developed model have been compared with the predictions from another EVP model and an elastoplastic model. The results obtained using the new model are significantly better than those obtained from this analyses with elastoplastic and the other EVP model. Another important issue investigated in this thesis is the effect of using matched permeability on the predicted performances in a plane strain analysis. Hirds (1992) matching procedure is often used to estimate the equivalent permeability for foundation soils improved with PVDs in a plane strain analysis. Good predictions in terms of settlement can be achieved using this technique. However, the predicted excess pwp can be significantly different than an equivalent axisymmetric analysis. A procedure is developed in this thesis, to correct the predicted excess pwp at the plane strain unitcell boundary. The results obtained with the correction procedure are much closer to the field measured values than the originally predicted ones. Later in the thesis, the effect of post construction soil movement on embedded structures such as abutment piles has been investigated. Bridge abutments are often constructed first for joining roadways and they are commonly supported on piles. These structures and consequently their pile foundations are often subjected to forces exerted by the lateral movements of soils on one side of them. So far, there has been limited research on such embedded structures subjected to lateral loading in a field scale. In this thesis, the behaviour of two abutment piles subjected to the lateral movements of the foundation soil due to the construction of Leneghans embankment have been modeled using a combination of two and three dimensional analyses. These two piles were installed on the northern berm section of Leneghans embankment about one and a half years after the construction of the embankment. They were instrumented with inclinometers at the center and were monitored for about four months. Excellent predictions for the lateral bending behaviour of the piles were achieved...|$|E
40|$|In this PhD study, two novel, {{multifunctional}} Fe-based {{metallic glasses}} (MGs) with the nominal components of Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 (also known as 1 K 101) and Fe 73. 5 Si 13. 5 B 9 Cu 1 Nb 3 (1 K 107) are manufactured by melt-spinning method {{to investigate the}} catalytic performance. The two produced glassy ribbons exhibit advanced catalytic capability when being employed as catalysts for the industrial dye pollutant treatment, presenting a great potential in achieving actual industrilization. Five dyes with different chemical bondings were treated as the targets for monitoring the catalytic efficiency, reusability and the corresponding mechanism. In the aspect of dye degradation and mineralization efficiency, the individual and combined effects of the various reaction parameters are firstly investigated by employing an orthogonal matrix (L 16 (45)) experimental methodology. Nearly 100 % color removal is achieved within 20 min under premium experimental control. The effects of catalyst dosage, dye concentration, peroxides concentration, light intensity and pH on dye degradation efficiency are fully discussed. The production of high redox radicals, such as hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and sulfate radicals (SO 4 •−), is investigated by quenching experiments. Total organic carbon (TOC) is employed for investigating the dye mineralization. In the aspect of sustainability and reusability, the Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 metallic glass exhibited a superior surface stability and reusability while activating persulfate as indicated by it being used for 30 times while maintaining an acceptable methylene blue (MB) degradation rate. The produced SiO 2 layer on the ribbon surface expanded strongly from the fresh use to the 20 th used, providing stable protection of the buried Fe. It {{is the first time}} to report that SO 4 •− with a high oxidative potential are successfully activated from persulfate by a Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 metallic glass. The catalytic mechanisms using Fe-based MGs as catalysts can be divided into three parts in this work: 1) electron transfer ability, 2) activation rate of peroxides, and 3) pre-adsorption <b>behavirour.</b> For the electron transter ability, the structural relaxation (α-relaxation) by annealing in an amorphous Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 alloy is studied at the atomic scale to compare the effect of atomic packing structures in amorphous and crystalline catalysts on dye degradation efficiency. The volume fractions of the crystalline structures, such as α-Fe, Fe 2 Si and Fe 2 B, in the as-received and annealed MGs are fully characterized. It is found that the randomly atomic packing structure with weak atomic bonding in the as-received metallic glass has an efficient electron transfer capability, presenting advanced superiorities in the aspects of production rate of hydroxyl radicals (•OH), dye degradation rate (k) and essential degradation ability (KSA) for water treatment. The discovery of this critically important work unveils why using MGs as catalysts having higher reactivity than the crystalline materials, and more importantly, provides new research opportunities into the study of synthetic catalysts. For the activation rate of peroxides, Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 and Fe 73. 5 Si 13. 5 B 9 Cu 1 Nb 3 MGs are employed for testing the activation rate of •OH. The results revealed that production rate of hydroxyl radicals using these two glassy ribbons is 5 - 10 times faster than other Fe-based catalysts. The likely explanation is that, a) the short-range ordered and long-range disordered atomic structure (weak atomic bonding) in amorphous alloy would cause easier electron activation under UV-Vis light irradiation compared to the crystallized structure (metallic bonding in atoms), b) the enhancement of Fe 2 + being in-situ converted from Fe 3 + under UV-Vis light irradiation. For the dye pre-adsorption, the quantity of dye adsorption on Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 and Fe 73. 5 Si 13. 5 B 9 Cu 1 Nb 3 ribbons is 7. 60 mg/g and 0. 35 mg/g, respectively, leading to faster dye degradation by using Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 compared to Fe 73. 5 Si 13. 5 B 9 Cu 1 Nb 3 ribbons. The equilibrium adsorption data using Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 ribbon is well fitted to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The calculated qe from the 2 nd kinetic model (7. 36 mg/g) and qm from Langmuir equation (12. 76 mg/g) are very close to the experimental data of 7. 6 mg/g and 13. 07 mg/g, respectively. The results suggest that the designed Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 and Fe 73. 5 Si 13. 5 B 9 Cu 1 Nb 3 MGs present a superior catalytic performance making them more desirable than the commercial used crystalline Fe-based catalysts. Therefore, this research demonstrates that through proper elemental and atomic structure design it is possible to develop new catalysts with favourable catalytic performance better than the current employed commercial catalysts for the industrial water treatment application...|$|E
