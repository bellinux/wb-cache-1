5000|$|Many nightclubs use <b>bouncers</b> {{to choose}} who {{can enter the}} club, or {{specific}} lounges or VIP areas. Some high-priced nightclubs have one group of <b>bouncers</b> to screen clients for entry at the main door, and then other <b>bouncers</b> to screen for entry to other dance floors, lounges or VIP areas. For legal reasons, in most jurisdictions, the <b>bouncers</b> have to check ID to ensure that prospective patrons are of legal drinking age {{and that they are}} not intoxicated already. In this respect, a nightclub's use of <b>bouncers</b> is no different from the use of <b>bouncers</b> by pubs and sports bars. However, in expensive, high-end nightclubs, <b>bouncers</b> may screen patrons using criteria other than just age and intoxication status: dress code and guest list.|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} of <b>bouncers</b> at on site establishments that served alcohol was observed. Our {{aim was to}} better understand how <b>bouncers</b> went about their job when the bar had a mandatory policy to check identification of all customers. Utilizing an ethnographic decision model, we found that <b>bouncers</b> {{were significantly more likely}} to card customers that were more casually dressed than others, those who were in their 30 s, and those in mixed racial groups. We posit that <b>bouncers</b> who failed to ask for identification did so because they appeared to know customers, they appeared to be of age, or they took a break and no one was checking for identification at the door. We found that <b>bouncers</b> presented a commanding presence by their dress and demeanor. <b>Bouncers,</b> we posit, function in three primary roles: customer relations, state law management, and establishment rule enforcer. Key Words: <b>Bouncers,</b> Bars, and Identification Checks In the United States, it is illegal to purchase alcohol if one is under the age 21...|$|R
5|$|Matthew Grant Webster, an 18-year-old {{who acted}} as a <b>bouncer</b> at the event, pleaded guilty to her murder {{and was sentenced to}} 20 years in prison with a 14-year non-parole period. He was {{released}} on parole in June 2004, after serving 14½ years. Guy Charles Wilson, the other <b>bouncer</b> and only other person aged over 18 at the party, pleaded guilty to assault; a third male (aged 15) pleaded guilty to having sex with a minor. The investigation of Leigh's murder proved controversial, however, as several people who admitted to various crimes, including assaulting Leigh, were never charged; nor was anyone ever charged with her sexual assault. Webster's confession did not match the forensic evidence. The murder investigation was reviewed by the New South Wales Crime Commission in 1996, and by the Police Integrity Commission in 1998, with the latter recommending the dismissal of the detective in charge of the investigation.|$|E

As a result of the injury, Tallon was rested for the following three matches.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bouncers</b> {{have also}} been known to be {{associated}} with criminal gangs, especially in places like Russia, Hong Kong or Japan, where <b>bouncers</b> may often belong to these groups or have to pay the crime syndicates to be able to operate. In Hong Kong, triad-connected reprisal or intimidation attacks against <b>bouncers</b> have been known to occur.|$|R
5|$|After his {{athletic}} career, Thorpe struggled {{to provide for}} his family. He {{found it difficult to}} work a non-sports-related job and never held a job {{for an extended period of}} time. During the Great Depression in particular, he had various jobs, among others as an extra for several movies, usually playing an American Indian chief in Westerns. He also worked as a construction worker, a doorman (<b>bouncer),</b> a security guard and a ditch digger, and briefly joined the United States Merchant Marine in 1945. Thorpe was a chronic alcoholic during his later life.|$|E
5|$|After {{purchasing}} a drum set and acquiring a piano from Joey's mother, Jimmy secures {{the remainder of}} the band's musical equipment from Duffy, a black market dealer. The band rehearses on the second floor above a snooker hall, and after much practice, they convince a local church community centre to give them a gig, under the pretence of it being an anti-heroin campaign. Jimmy then hires Mickah Wallace, a hot-tempered <b>bouncer,</b> to act as the band's security. The band draws a good crowd, but after Deco inadvertently hits Derek with his microphone stand, the amplifiers explode, resulting in a power outage.|$|E
5|$|All Star Pro-Wrestling was {{announced}} in January 1999 as part of Square's desire to expand into more diverse game genres on the PlayStation 2 than their usual role-playing games. While DreamFactory developed most of Square's previous fighting games (namely Tobal No. 1, Tobal 2, and Ehrgeiz), Square decided to develop a wrestling game internally as Dream Factory was already working on The <b>Bouncer,</b> another Square title. The game was produced by Yusuke Hirata of Parasite Eve 2 fame, head of Square's Osaka-based fifth production team. The score, which was never released in album form, consists mostly of rock music and was composed by Tsuyoshi Sekito, Kenichiro Fukui, and Kumi Tanioka.|$|E
50|$|On January 29, 2006 Sjödin {{was arrested}} by the police outside the pub Crazy Horse in Östermalm in Stockholm. According to Babak Jamei, one of the <b>bouncers,</b> a drunk Sjödin not only {{assaulted}} him and other <b>bouncers</b> but also used derogatory words - alluding {{to the fact that}} he was an immigrant. Sjödin, however, claims that the <b>bouncers</b> assaulted her and her friends. She had to spend the night in the constabulary. The prosecutor rejected Sjödins allegations, but continued investigating the allegations made by the <b>bouncers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most nightclubs employ {{teams of}} <b>bouncers,</b> {{who have the}} power to {{restrict}} entry to the club and remove people. Some <b>bouncers</b> use handheld metal detectors to prevent weapons being brought into clubs. <b>Bouncers</b> often eject patrons who bring party drugs into the venue. <b>Bouncers</b> count the number of people admitted to a club in order to prevent stampedes and fire code violations, and also enforce a club's dress code, frequently accepting bribes to let people jump the queue. Many clubs have balcony areas specifically for the security team to watch over the clubbers.|$|R

5|$|Amidst {{his years}} of studying, Lundgren honed his karate skills by {{training}} hard in the dojo for five years, attaining the rank of 2nd dan black belt in Kyokushin in 1978. He captained the Swedish Kyokushin karate team, and was a formidable challenger at the 1979 World Open Tournament (arranged by the Kyokushin Karate Organization) {{when he was only}} a green belt. He won the European championships in 1980 and 1981, and a heavyweight tournament in Australia in 1982. In 1982, Lundgren graduated with a master's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Sydney. During his time in Sydney, he earned a living as a <b>bouncer</b> in a nightclub in the renowned King's Cross area.|$|E
5|$|Another catch {{went down}} off Miller {{late in the}} day when Compton, who had reached a century, edged him but Johnson dropped the catch at slip. Charlie Barnett then edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller {{completed}} a difficult catch. Compton then hit Miller for four, provoking the paceman's first <b>bouncer</b> of the day. Compton hooked it away for two and the next delivery slipped out of Miller's hand and cleared the batsman's head on the full, provoking some jeering in the crowd. England reached stumps at 6/345, just one run ahead of the tourists, with Compton on 154.|$|E
5|$|During {{the lunch}} interval, heavy rain fell, {{before the sun}} began to dry the pitch, making the ball skid through upon England's {{resumption}} at 13/1. Miller beat Washbrook's bat twice in one over soon after the resumption, {{but was unable to}} extract an edge. Lindwall reached his peak speed and Edrich edged to first slip, where Ian Johnson got both hands to the ball above his head, but failed to hold on. Edrich was on four at the time and this was part of a 20-minute passage of play during which England was unable to score. The next ball from Lindwall, Washbrook was caught on the run by Brown on the fine leg boundary after attempting to hook a <b>bouncer</b> pitched on the line of leg stump. It was to be the first of several times that Washbrook was dismissed while hooking, attracting substantial criticism. Washbrook's fall left England at 15/2 after 41 minutes of batting and brought Compton to the crease to join Edrich. Compton square drove Miller to the boundary for four, which prompted a retaliatory <b>bouncer</b> and a negative crowd reaction. Edrich was not scoring quickly but he defied the bowling of Miller and Lindwall as the English pair took the score to 46. Likewise, Compton was restraining his natural inclination to attack in an attempt to rebuild the innings after the two early wickets. During this period Brown made a series of one-handed run-saving stops in the field. The rain had also softened up the pitch and as a result, the playing surface did not offer much bounce.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, a Garda {{officer and}} three nightclub <b>bouncers</b> were {{repeatedly}} stabbed outside the Voodoo Nightclub. One of the <b>bouncers</b> had his leg penetrated by the blade while the Garda {{had his hand}} slashed.|$|R

5|$|Edrich then {{relieved}} Coxon, who had bowled {{his first}} seven overs in Test cricket {{for the loss}} of only 10 runs. Edrich bowled a <b>bouncer,</b> which Bradman tried to swing to the leg side, but the leading edge instead went in the air and landed behind point. On 13, Bradman leg glanced a Bedser ball from his legs, narrowly evading Hutton in the trap at short fine leg. After one hour, he was on 14. Bradman had fallen twice for the leg trap in the previous Test. Bedser continued to the probe the Australian captain with inswingers, trying to extract a lofted leg glance in the vicinity if the waiting Hutton. In contrast, Morris was playing fluently and scoring many runs from the back cut.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Matsueda and Eguchi {{made their}} first major {{collaboration}} by scoring the role-playing racing game Racing Lagoon, with synthesizer programmer Ryo Yamazaki providing three tracks. Matsueda {{was responsible for}} all the music except the battle, opening, and ending themes. They collaborated again on the soundtrack to the PlayStation 2 title The <b>Bouncer</b> in 2000, whereas the two took a more equal share of the music. A large amount of the compositions produced was not used {{in the game and}} there were also many post-production demands. Afterward, Matsueda created 25 pieces of background music for Square's PlayOnline viewer used for Final Fantasy XI and Tetra Master.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{was picked}} for Tasmania in two matches against the touring South Africans in January 1932. He failed {{to perform in}} the first match in Launceston, taking 1/68 and 2/45 and scoring 17 and 9. However, Nash had a lively bowling {{performance}} in the Hobart match, making the ball come off the wicket at a great pace and gaining match figures of 9/137, including two wickets in consecutive balls and breaking batsman Eric Dalton's jaw with a vicious <b>bouncer</b> on the hat-trick ball. South African captain Jock Cameron praised Nash for his performance as his bowling in the match {{was thought to be}} as quick and dangerous as any bowler in the world.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bouncers,</b> Diablos, Slashers, and Steal {{joined the}} Rumble and Mob {{in their first}} ever season of Slamball in 2002. The <b>Bouncers</b> made the playoffs but were {{defeated}} in the 1st round by the Diablos. The next season they finished 3rd in Division Y and {{failed to make the}} playoffs. When Slamball returned, after a hiatus until 2008, the <b>Bouncers</b> changed their colors and ended up finishing with the worst record in Slamball history, 2-10 after starting 2-0.|$|R
50|$|Use {{of force}} {{training}} programs teach <b>bouncers</b> {{ways to avoid}} using force and explain what types of force are considered allowable by the courts. Some bars have {{gone so far as}} to institute policies barring physical contact, where <b>bouncers</b> are instructed to ask a drunk or disorderly patron to leave—if the patron refuses, the <b>bouncers</b> call police. However, if the police are called too frequently, it can reflect badly on the venue upon renewal of its liquor licence.|$|R
50|$|Another {{strategy}} {{used in some}} bars is to hire smaller, {{less threatening}} or female <b>bouncers,</b> because they may {{be better able to}} defuse conflicts than large, intimidating <b>bouncers.</b> The more 'impressive' <b>bouncers,</b> in the often tense environments they are supposed to supervise, are also often challenged by aggressive males wanting to prove their machismo. Large and intimidating <b>bouncers,</b> whilst providing an appearance of strong security, may also drive customers away in cases where a more relaxed environment is desired. In addition, female security staff, apart from having fewer problems searching female patrons for drugs or weapons and entering women's washrooms to check for illegal activities, are also considered as better able to deal with drunk or aggressive women.|$|R
5|$|The Australians {{travelled}} to London to play Surrey at The Oval. Tallon came in {{with the}} score at 6/553, and held up his end, scoring an unbeaten 50 as his partners steadily fell and Australia were bowled out at 632. Tallon had some difficulty in English conditions as he sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a Ray Lindwall <b>bouncer</b> on a misty morning during the match and was hit as he put hand over his face for protection, with the ball running away for four byes. Tallon took two catches in the second innings as Australia won the match by an innings, but he also conceded 24 byes in Surrey's match total of 336.|$|E
5|$|The {{final day}} started poorly for England, with Compton being caught off Johnston {{from the second}} ball of the day. Yardley and Dollery took the score to 133 before Toshack took two wickets in the same over. Eight runs later, Dollery was bowled from a Lindwall <b>bouncer</b> that stayed low. Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck later in the same over to leave England at 141/8. England were bowled out for 186, ceding a 409-run victory. Toshack ended the innings with 5/40, while Lindwall and Johnston took three and two respectively. The gross {{attendance}} was 132,000 and receipts were £43,000 — a record for a Test in England.|$|E
5|$|The teams then {{played out}} a rain-affected {{draw in the}} Third Test match at Manchester, where England elected to bat first. On the first day, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall {{delivery}} and was caught by Tallon for 32, leaving England at 5/119. Compton returned at the fall of Edrich's wicket after previously leaving the ground after being bloodied {{in the head by}} a Lindwall <b>bouncer.</b> He batted to stumps, after being dropped one-handed on 50 by Tallon, before again being dropped on 64 late in the day by the gloveman from the bowling of Johnston. England closed at 7/231 with Compton on 64.|$|E

5000|$|A 1998 article [...] "Responses by Security Staff to Aggressive Incidents in Public Settings" [...] in the Journal of Drug Issues {{examined}} 182 violent incidents involving crowd controllers (<b>bouncers)</b> {{that occurred}} in bars in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The study indicated that in 12% of the incidents the <b>bouncers</b> had good responses, in 20% of the incidents, the <b>bouncers</b> had a neutral response; and in 36% of the incidents, the <b>bouncers</b> [...] "... responses were rated as bad—that is, the crowd controllers enhanced the likelihood of violence but were themselves not violent." [...] Finally, [...] "... in almost one-third of incidents, 31 per cent, the crowd controllers' responses were rated as ugly. The controllers' actions involved gratuitous aggression, harassment of patrons and provocative behaviour." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1990s and 2000s, {{a number}} of <b>bouncers</b> have written [...] "tell-all" [...] books about their {{experiences}} on the door. They indicate that male <b>bouncers</b> are respected by some club-goers as the ultimate 'hard men', {{while at the same}} time, these <b>bouncers</b> can also be lightning rods for aggression and macho posturing on the part of obnoxious male customers wanting to prove themselves. Bouncing has also started to attract some academic interest as part of ethnographic studies into violent subcultures. <b>Bouncers</b> were selected as one of the groups studied by several English researchers in the 1990s because their culture was seen as 'grounded in violence', as well as because the group had increasingly been 'demonised', especially in common liberal discourse (see Research section of this article).|$|R
