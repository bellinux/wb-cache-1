40|$|International audienceThe {{self-absorption}} {{technique is}} a simple method to determine the line integrated density of metastable atoms in low-pressure plasmas. In order to employ this technique, {{it is necessary to}} make an assumption on the spatial profiles of both the emission intensity and the absorbing species, which usually are unknown and can be highly nonuniform. Taking Ar*(1 s 5) atoms in a capacitively coupled plasma as an example, the influence of nonuniformity on the measurement of the line integrated density of the absorbing species is investigated analytically. It is proved that when the two spatial profiles are the same, the obtained line integrated density is independent of the functional form of this profile. This is also true if the density of the absorbing species is small (weak absorption), even though the emission profile is {{different from that of the}} absorbing species. However, if the density is high (strong absorption), the choice of the profiles has a significant influence on the deduced line integrated density. In the experiment, it is found that in argon-oxygen mixture discharges, in which Ar*(1 s 5) density is low (weak absorption), the measured densities <b>by</b> <b>self-absorption</b> are in very good agreement with the results obtained from laser absorption. However, in pure argon discharge, when the density is high (strong absorption), the measured densities <b>by</b> <b>self-absorption</b> are significantly smaller than that by laser absorption. Both phenomena have been predicted by the model results. The smaller densities obtained <b>by</b> <b>self-absorption</b> in the pure argon discharge are attributed to the assumption of the same spatial profile used in the model...|$|E

It is found that the inverse of this PFY spectrum, which we term inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY), is linearly proportional to the x-ray absorption cross-section without any corrections due to saturation or self-absorption effects. We demonstrate this technique on the Cu L and Nd M absorption edges of the high-Tc cuprate LNSCO by measuring the O K PFY and comparing the total electron yield, total fluorescence yield and IPFY spectra.

Surface oxidation or reduction in crystal thickness yields lower values. For microcrystals of dimensions comparable with the exciton mean free path (IV. 0. 1,U), the decay time is reduced below TO due to premature conversion of excitons into photons at the crystal surface.

Polarized transmittance, reflectance, and photoluminescence PL spectra have been measured over a broad spectral range, at different temperatures.

The PL spectral shape and external quantum efficiency are significantly affected <b>by</b> <b>self-absorption</b> inside the polymer film and by refractive effects at the polymer-air interface. In order to elucidate these aspects we have determined the dispersion of the parallel and perpendicular components of the complex dielectric constant 1 +i 2, by which the PL spectra have been corrected according to Fresnel equations. After correction, the PL intensity is found to be higher when the excitation is polarized perpendicular to the stretching direction, a fact that we attribute to charge-induced PL quenching. We have also considered the influence of the refractive index on the PL spontaneous emission rate and on the light extraction from the polymer film.
