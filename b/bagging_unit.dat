40|$|The {{influence}} of active modified atmosphere packaging MAP (10. 0 kPa of O 2 and 5 kPa of CO 2) on palletized system was evaluated {{to extend the}} marketability of fresh plums cv. Angeleno. Fruits were wrapped with a polyethylene film in pallet <b>bag</b> <b>units</b> at 1 C and 90 % relative humidity for up to 60 days. The gas values of the pallet bags, the fruit weight losses and their qualitative and nutraceutical characteristics were periodically monitored to evaluate the goodness of storage. The results showed as the pallet bag have maintained the market life of Angeleno plums to up to 60 days, preserving the most important qualitative traits of fruits. After 20, 40 and 60 days the MAP treatment maintained the pulp harder than control fruits respectively of 0. 87, 0. 75 and 0. 46 kg/cm 2 and the SUAC index (quotient of the sum of sugars and sum of acids) was unaffected by the gas composition. Pratical Applications: The storage in pallet under different MAP conditions could be a promising technique for plums and specifically allows different items with different technical requirements to be stored in the same cold-storage room. Furthermore, the storage units could also be conveniently used for the fruit transport along the entire supply chain to reach markets far from production areas...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: A high {{percentage}} of musculoskeletal disorders in workplaces occur due to awkward posture and non-ergonomic design of the work stations for lifting and carrying of materials. To avoid these injuries, jobs should be designed {{in a way that}} ergonomics risk factors are controlled properly. The aim {{of this study was to}} utilize ergonomics interventions to minimize ergonomics risk factors in <b>bag</b> packing <b>unit</b> in a mineral processing plant. Material and Method: This cross sectional study was carried out among 20 workers of <b>bag</b> packing <b>unit.</b> Camera recording of working postures, evaluation of medical records, interview, and REBA technique were used to identify the ergonomic risk factors. Interventions included changing the conveyor belt height and the use of spring pallets (spring table). Data were analyzed using Paired T-Test by SPSS software version 18. Result: Before implementing ergonomics intervention, a total of 75 % of evaluated postures by REBA technique obtained score of 8 - 10 (very high risk level) and 25 % had score of 11 - 15 (very high risk level) that correspond to the action level 3 and 4, respectively. Following the implementation of ergonomics interventions, a total of 90 % of the analyzed postures showed action level 2 (moderate risk level) and the remainder 10 percent of evaluated postures showed high risk level. Comparison of REBA technique scores before and after implementing interventions showed a significant difference (P-value < 0. 05). Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, the implementation of ergonomics interventions has remarkably decreased the required action level and it may be able to improve work-related postures...|$|R

40|$|Wood pellet storage {{safety is}} an {{important}} aspect for implementing woody biomass as a renewable energy source. When wood pellets are stored indoors in large quantities (tons) in poorly ventilated spaces in buildings, such as in basements, off-gassing of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can significantly affect indoor air quality. To determine the emission rates and potential impact of VOC emissions, a series of laboratory and field measurements were conducted using softwood, hardwood, and blended wood pellets manufactured in New York. Evacuated canisters were used to collect air samples from the headspace of drums containing pellets and then in basements and pellet storage areas of homes and small businesses. Multiple peaks were identified during GC/MS and GC/FID analysis, and four primary VOCs were characterized and quantified: methanol, pentane, pentanal, and hexanal. Laboratory results show that total VOCs (TVOCs) concentrations for softwood (SW) were statistically (p < 0. 02) higher than blended or hardwood (HW) (SW: 412 21 25; blended: 203 21 4; HW: 99 21 8, ppb). The emission rate from HW was the fastest, followed by blended and SW, respectively. Emissions rates were found to range from 10 (- 1) to 10 (- 5) units, depending upon environmental factors. Field measurements resulted in airborne concentrations ranging from 67 21 8 to 5000 21 3000 ppb of TVOCs and 12 to 1500 ppb of aldehydes, with higher concentrations found in a basement with a large fabric <b>bag</b> storage <b>unit</b> after fresh pellet delivery and lower concentrations for aged pellets. These results suggest that large fabric <b>bag</b> storage <b>units</b> resulted in a substantial release of VOCs into the building air. Occupants of the buildings tested discussed concerns about odor and sensory irritation when new pellets were delivered. The sensory response was likely due to the aldehydes.

40|$|Patients {{undergoing}} {{stem cell}} transplantation may require transfusion of <b>units</b> (<b>bags)</b> of packed {{red blood cells}} (PRBCs). Modelling of PRBC usage is important not only for prediction of transfusion requirements in future patients but also for its use as an inverse surrogate for engraftment, that is transplantation success. Inspection of PRBC unit usage reveals a strong preference for even numbers, which is caused by behavioural preference on the part of prescribing physicians. Digit preference is a phenomenon observed more commonly with self-reported data: typically survey respondents round recalled quantities such as the age at which a life event occurred to multiples of 5 or 10. In all cases, we can conceive of a latent variable, which has a smooth distribution, which is transformed via stochastic rules to a discrete variable with probability spikes at preferred digits. We propose a modelling framework based on a latent variable specification and stochastic transformation to the spiked distribution. Loglinear models for the mean of the process are implemented. Specification of the stochastic rules is important to success in accurate modelling of the process. 7 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{the elderly}} in Scandinavia, multi-dose drug {{dispensing}} (MDD) is a common alternative to ordinary prescriptions (OP). MDD patients receive their drugs in <b>unit</b> <b>bags,</b> one for each dose occasion. The prescribing procedure differs between MDD and OP. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the association between MDD and quality of drug treatment (QDT). Methodology/Principal Findings: A cross-sectional study was performed of all inhabitants in Region Västra Götaland alive on December 31 st 2007, aged $ 65 years, with $ 1 prescribed drug and $ 2 health care visits for $ 2 diagnoses for obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and/or cardiovascular disease in 2005 – 2007 (n = 24, 146). For each patient, drug treatment on December 31 st 2007 was estimated from drugs registered in the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. QDT was evaluated according to established quality indicators ($ 10 drugs, Long-acting benzodiazepines, Drugs with anticholinergic action, $ 3 psychotropics, and Drugs combinations that should be avoided). Logistic regression, with adjustments for age, sex, burden of disease, and residence, was performed to investigate the association between MDD and QDT.

40|$|The {{laboratory}} {{dust collector}} {{tests showed that}} 99. 6 % of the test dust fed into the collector was captured by the dustbags. Figure 1 shows {{the condition of the}} main chamber before and after testing. Total weight gain on the canister filter was over five times greater without use of the <b>bag.</b> The RAM-I <b>unit</b> showed respirable dust levels in the collector exhaust to be over two times higher when tests were conducted without the bags in place. The APS showed that the" number of total dust particles emitted from the exhaust was two times greater when the tests were conducted without the bags. Since nearly all the dust is contained in the bag, operator exposure is improved when emptying the collector box's main chamber. Filter loading is greatly decreased when using the bags, enabling longer periods of drilling without filter removal/cleaning. Pressure drop across the filter for all tests ranged from 3. 0 to 3. 3 in w. g. when the bag was used and from 4. 0 to 8. 4 in w. g. without the bag. Filtered air emitted from the collector has less respirable dust and fewer total dust particles when the bags are used. These results show that benefits from use of the bags are realized in all areas of operator exposure. In order to use these bags in underground coal mines, the dustbags must be accepted by MSHA as an optional item for the specific dust collection system and machine model (30 CFR 33). In addition, the collector must be equipped with a predump option and must have a retrofit kit installed inside the collector to connect to the bag..

40|$|Multidose {{dispensed}} {{drugs are}} drugs machine-packed into dose <b>unit</b> <b>bags</b> for each time of administration. Trondheim municipality decided in 2005 to implement Multidose Drug Dispensing (MDD) in home care services. At that time, {{there was a}} lack of scientific knowledge about the effects of MDD. The health care management of Trondheim therefore decided to study the implementation in collaboration with NTNU. MDD was adopted gradually during 2006. Three studies were conducted with the common main aim of investigating the safety of medicines management during the implementation of MDD. A complex intervention was designed, including both internal and external controls, and pre-post-examinations. Qualitative as well as quantitative data was gathered, forming a method-, data source-, and observer-triangulation. The introduction of MDD reduced the discrepancies between the medication lists at the general practitioners (GPs), and in the home care services, and even moreso between the GPs and the pharmacies. However, for patients with multidose dispensed drugs, a corresponding improvement also occurred for drugs they received outside the MDD system (e. g. eye drops and inhalers). This finding suggests that new routines, and better collaboration between health practitioners, more than the MDD system by itself, contributed to the improvements. Nevertheless, even if the number of discrepancies between medication lists were reduced, the discrepancies continued to be high, demonstrating that more efforts are needed. Other reported improvements also occurred. Both the general practitioners and the pharmacists reported a better overview of the patients’ medication and thus a better control. The involved health care practitioners also stated an increased trust in each other, as well as in the MDD system, as better collaboration emerged. However, trust in the MDD system was challenged by a loss of flexibility to make changes in medication/dosage compared to the manual system. The nurses in the home care services expressed that the automation would decrease their knowledge of patients’ drug intake, and thus make them less trusted in observing patients. The GPs believed that electronic communication could improve the exchange of information and updating, and thus produce an even better effect from the MDD system. The GPs in Trondheim showed a positive attitude to MDD. Increased workload was reported, but still most GPs wanted the system to be continued. The decision to only allow the patient’s GP to prescribe multidose dispensed drugs contributed to the improvements seen in routines of prescription, communication, and cooperation. The decision made the GPs take on a greater responsibility with their patients’ medications, and made the coordination in the MDD system less complex. However, the improved routines and collaboration between GPs and home care services and pharmacies, only related to patients receiving multidose dispensed drugs. The improvements were not transferred to other patients on the GP’s list having drugs administered by the home care services. The introduction of MDD in Trondheim was followed by improved quality in the medicines management. This thesis shows, however, that the main contribution to improved safety was emphasizing the different steps of the medicines management, to improvements in communication and cooperation between health care practitioners, and the clarifying of roles and responsibilities. The findings cannot be generalized straight forwardly. However, insights from the three studies presented in this thesis should be valid for others planning to implement an MDD system, or already using MDD in the home care services.
