25|$|A major topic at the Doha ministerial {{regarded}} the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The issue involves the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> between {{the pharmaceutical companies}} in developed countries that held patents on medicines and the public health needs in developing countries. Another issue concerns the protection of traditional medicinal knowledge and practices. Before the Doha meeting, the United States claimed that the current language in TRIPS was flexible enough to address public health emergencies, but other countries insisted on new language.|$|E
60|$|In the {{original}} {{institution of the}} Supreme Council, reasons may have existed against rendering the tenure of the Counsellors in their office precarious. A plan of reform might have required the permanence of the persons who were just appointed by Parliament to execute it. But the act of 1780 gave a duration coexistent with the statute itself to a Council not appointed by act of Parliament, nor chosen for any temporary or special purpose; by which means the servants in the highest situation, let their conduct be never so grossly criminal, cannot be removed, unless the Court of Directors and ministers of the crown can be found to concur in the same opinion of it. The prevalence of the Indian factions in the Court of Directors and Court of Proprietors, and sometimes in the state itself, renders this agreement extremely difficult: if the principal members of the Direction {{should be in a}} conspiracy with any principal servant under censure, it will be impracticable; because the first act must originate there. The reduced state of the authority of this kingdom in Bengal may be traced in a great measure to that very natural source of independence. In many cases the instant removal of an offender from his power of doing mischief is the only mode of preventing the utter and perhaps irretrievable ruin of public affairs. In such a case the process ought to be simple, and the power absolute in one or in either hand separately. By contriving the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> formed in the act, notorious offence, gross error, or palpable insufficiency have many chances of retaining and abusing authority, whilst the variety of representations, hearings, and conferences, and possibly the mere jealousy and competition between rival powers, may prevent any decision, and at length give time and means for settlements and compromises among parties, made at the expense of justice and true policy. But this act of 1780, not properly distinguishing judicial process from executive arrangements, requires in effect nearly the same degree of solemnity, delay, and detail for removing a political inconvenience which attends a criminal proceeding for the punishment of offences. It goes further, and gives the same tenure to all who shall succeed to vacancies which was given to those whom the act found in office.|$|E

50|$|The <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> test {{examines}} {{the interests of}} the states themselves, and the reasons for which the laws in question were passed.

40|$|In public {{international}} law, EU law, {{and national}} law {{there are numerous}} rules and principles stipulating the recognition of foreign administrative decisions. The article explores duties to recognise foreign administrative decisions, the possible limitations of such duties and the handling of cases involving recognition. Recognition of a foreign administrative decision means a form of transfer of public power from one state to another in an individual case. In this way, the traditional limitation of administrative law {{to the state and}} its territory becomes less important. Issues related to recognition of foreign administrative decisions could be understood as a <b>balancing</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> between the involved legal orders and the affected individuals. The article puts forward a categorisation of recognition mechanisms in the light <b>of</b> this <b>balancing</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests.</b> It is concluded that the degrees of transfer of public power through the different recognition mechanisms make it possible for legislators and legal decision-makers to find an appropriate level of cooperation...|$|R

The FON Program operates on a triple track, involving not only diplomatic representations and operational assertions by U.S. military units, but also bilateral and multilateral consultations with other governments in an effort to promote maritime stability and consistency with international law, stressing the need for and obligation of all States to adhere to the customary international law rules and practices reflected in the LOS Convention.|$|E

"Free" [...] sites {{based on}} {{advertising}} revenue face the dilemma that while relaxation {{of the rules}} encourages users to post their feelings and opinions and upload user-generated content with less fear of being censored or shut down, it also {{increases the risk of}} an offended sponsor pulling its sponsorship, if offensive materials or comments are made online. With more uploading and content-posting freedom comes an increased risk of copyright and defamation lawsuits, hate speech charges and other legal problems.

50|$|According to the {{contemporary}} press, the general public in Budapest considered Márkus' election as waste of an agile and energetic career, since the position of Lord Mayor was associated with limitied and more passive powers. Márkus put {{the emphasis on the}} <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> and rarely came into conflict with the national cabinet. A journalist of the Pesti Hírlap argued that the Lord Mayor showed his forceful behavior only against employees, which vanished during negotiations with equal partners. Nevertheless, Márkus had social prestige in the Hungarian public life. Francis Joseph granted him lifetime membership in the House of Magnates on 21 April 1898. Márkus was also awarded Knight Cross of the Imperial Austrian Order of Leopold on 20 November 1898. He {{was a member of the}} Memorial Committee for Empress Elisabeth of Austria, who was assassinated on 10 September 1898. He also received 2nd Class of the Order of the Crown (Prussia), Knight Cross of the Order of the Crown (Romania) and the 2nd Class of the Order of Saint Stanislaus of the Russian Empire. As a member of the House of Magnates, Márkus was active in the legislative and evaluation committees. He participated in the work of several social organizations; he served as a member of the Directorate of the Railway Society of Budapest and functioned as Chairperson of the Home of Private Officials. In 1900, he organized among the members of the General Assembly a fundraising for the deceased civil servants' widows and orphans, called Márkus Fund after him.|$|E

The Authority was established in 1996, concurrent with the expiration of the 70-year-old concession of the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC), and pursuant to the Electricity Market Law of 1996. Prior {{to the establishment of}} the Electricity Authority, the Electric Corporation itself operated vis-a-vis the government of Israel in various fields related to regulation of the electricity system in Israel, such as the initiation of the construction of new power plants.The powers and tasks of the Authority, as well as the composition of the Authority's members and its manner of operation are defined in and based on the Electricity Market Law. The Electricity Authority serves as an independent professional regulator in matters concerning the electricity market in Israel, and is responsible for the regulation and oversight of the provision of public utilities in the field of electricity in Israel. The Authority is obligated to maintain a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> between consumers, the Electric Corporation, electricity manufacturers, and the state.Part {{of the role of the}} Electricity Authority is the setting of the electricity tariffs in Israel, and the implementation of Israeli government decisions which have set a required level of power production by private producers and by renewable energy, through the encouragement and regulation of private power producers and producers of electricity from renewable energies, alongside the Electric Corporation.|$|E
5000|$|Carr {{argued against}} {{the view that}} the {{problems}} of the world in 1939 were the work of a clique of evil men and dismissed Arnold J. Toynbee's view that [...] "we are living in an exceptionally wicked age". Carr asserted that the problems of the world in 1939 were due to structural political-economic problems that transcended the importance of individual national leaders and argued that the focus on individuals as causal agents was equivalent to focusing on the trees rather the forest. Carr contended that the 19th century theory of a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> amongst the powers was an erroneous belief and instead contended that international relations was an incessant struggle between the economically privileged [...] "have" [...] powers and the economically disadvantaged [...] "have not" [...] powers. In this economic understanding of international relations, [...] "have" [...] powers like the United States, Britain and France were inclined to avoid war because of their contented status whereas [...] "have not" [...] powers like Germany, Italy and Japan were inclined towards war as they had nothing to lose. In Carr's opinion, ideological differences between fascism and democracy were beside the point as he used as an example Japan, which Carr argued was not a fascist state but still a [...] "have not" [...] power. Carr attacked Adam Smith for claiming there was a [...] "harmony of interests" [...] between the individual and their community, writing that [...] "the doctrine of the harmony of interests was tenable only if you left out of account the interests of the weak who must be driven to the wall". Carr claimed after World War I, the American President Woodrow Wilson had unfortunately created an international order based on the doctrine of [...] "harmony of interests" [...] through the [...] "utopian" [...] instrument of the League of Nations with disastrous results. Carr argued {{that the only way to}} make the League (which Carr otherwise held in complete contempt by 1939) an effective force for peace was to persuade Germany, Italy and Japan to return to the League by promising them that their economic grievances could and would be worked out at the League. Carr called The Twenty Year's Crisis:"not exactly a Marxist work, but strongly impregnated with Marxist ways of thinking, applied to international affairs" [...] The distinction between [...] "have" [...] and [...] "have not" [...] nations perhaps reflected the influence of the theory first propagated by Enrico Corradini and later adopted by Benito Mussolini of the natural conflict between [...] "proletarian" [...] nations like Italy and [...] "plutocratic" [...] nations like Britain. In The Twenty Years' Crisis, Carr wrote: [...] "When Herr Hitler refuses to believe that [...] "God has permitted some nations first to acquire a world by force and then to defend this robbery with moralising theories", we have an authentic echo of the Marxist denial of a community of interest between [...] "haves" [...] and [...] "have-nots", of the Marxist exposure of the interested character of [...] "bourgeois" [...] morality..." ...|$|E
