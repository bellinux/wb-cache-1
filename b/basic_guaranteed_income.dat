50|$|Geolibertarians seek to {{synthesize}} propertarian libertarianism and a geoist (or Georgist) philosophy of land as unowned commons or equally owned by all people, citing the classical economic distinction between unimproved land and private property. The rental value of land {{is produced by}} the labors of the community and, as such, rightly belongs to {{the community at large}} and not solely to the landholder. A land value tax (LVT) is levied as an annual fee for exclusive access to a section of earth, which is collected and redistributed to the community either through public goods, such as public security or a court system, or {{in the form of a}} <b>basic</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>income</b> called a citizen's dividend. Geolibertarians view the LVT as a single tax to replace all other methods of taxation, which are deemed unjust violations of the non-aggression principle.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Despite the {{centrality}} of employment to contemporary political and economic discourse - a position reinforced by the recent economic crisis - political theory has failed to engage with the organization of work or with the norms guiding it. This dissertation offers {{a deeper understanding of}} the political functions and significance of employment by analyzing them in conjunction with freedom. In particular, it reveals the role of freedom in securing our allegiance to paid work, and performs an immanent critique on the basis of freedom. Chapter 1 analyzes freedom in neoliberal philosophy through the work of Friedrich Hayek. It argues that Hayek's individualistic account of freedom and celebration of entrepreneurialism nourishes a view of paid work as an act of freedom, despite structural coercion to sell our labor power. Chapter 2 analyzes flexibility as a neoliberal instantiation of freedom in relation to employment that offers workers some degree of freedom and thus helps secure our commitment to the wage relation. At the same time, this chapter argues that our attachment to work and the individualized, precarious, and competitive nature of the labor market limit the emancipatory potential of flexibility. Realizing this potential requires a reconfiguration of the meaning of work (or a `refusal of work') and the introduction of a <b>basic</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>income</b> (BI). While signs of such a `refusal' are hard to find in contemporary society, chapter 3 reads the riots and public sector strikes in Britain in 2011 as moments of instability in the meaning of work. By resisting the extension of working life in the name of retirement, the strikers struggled with the government over the proper relation between work, life, and freedom. Demands for the BI appear to make an even stronger challenge to the ideology of work, as this scheme would enable a lifetime of freedom from work. Yet as chapter 4 reveals, many arguments for the BI extol its capacity to boost employment and would therefore fail to tackle various problems stemming from the preeminence of work. Only a more radical critique of the work society itself can help realize the emancipatory potential of both the basic income and the existing regime of flexibility...|$|E

"The {{difference}} between a National Dividend and a <b>basic</b> <b>income</b> <b>guarantee</b> is that the dividend is tied to production and consumption data and may vary from year to year.

40|$|<b>Basic</b> <b>Income</b> <b>Guarantee</b> {{proposals}} aim at, {{among other}} objectives, the salutary goal {{of providing a}} minimum income floor beneath which individuals cannot fall. We analyze this family of proposals {{through the lens of}} comparative political economy, arguing that politics is not an appropriate institutional environment for pursuing the end of an income floor. Once the notion of a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>income</b> is cast in realistic, probabilistic terms, it becomes a live question whether the market or the polity can better secure a Basic Income. Actual markets must be compared to real-world political processes rather than idealized policy proposals in order to ascertain their desirability. Drawing on the extant literature on the failure of political processes to realize the goals of other redistributive programs, we argue that <b>Basic</b> <b>Income</b> <b>Guarantee</b> proposals likewise ignore politics as practiced and are thus equally subject to critiques both of their means-ends coherence and their vulnerability to political opportunism. ...|$|R

Moreover, this minimal level is greater than the current redistributive efforts in the United States, and something close to what other developed countries provide to their citizens.|$|R

40|$|We propose {{mechanism}} for implementing a two-stage harmonized <b>Basic</b> <b>Income</b> <b>Guarantee</b> with federal and provincial components.

40|$|Welfare was {{reformed}} {{significantly in}} 1996, and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was expanded substantially {{during the last}} decade. In the wake of these events, welfare rolls have shrunk dramatically and employment among the poor has increased, leading many to conclude that these policies have achieved important equity and efficiency goals. It is argued here that these conclusions are too strong. The work requirements and time limits of welfare reform create equity outcomes that are dubious and leave the potential for inefficiencies in the allocation of labor. The EITC excludes {{almost half of the}} poor population under age 65, rewards poorer working families less well than it does less poor working families, and provides a sizable work disincentive for a large proportion of its recipients. It is shown here that the poor are not homogeneous. Specifically, the very poor have a much higher incidence of physical and other disabilities. The ability to work varies substantially with income among the poor. There is a case to be made for a much more straightforward form of redistribution, such as the <b>Basic</b> <b>Income</b> <b>Guarantee</b> (BIG). It is quite possible that a BIG would accomplish goals of equity and efficiency more fully than the current mosaic of redistributive programs. income redistribution, welfare, welfare reform, EITC, <b>basic</b> <b>income</b> <b>guarantee,</b> negative <b>income</b> tax,...|$|R
