40|$|Abstract — Next {{generation}} mobile {{communications systems}} {{will most likely}} employ network MIMO in order to mitigate inter-cell interference and improve system fairness and spectral efficiency. Critical issues of such schemes are, however, the large extent of backhaul infrastructure required for the information exchange between cooperating base stations, {{and the availability of}} channel knowledge at transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we consider a cooperative downlink transmission under a constrained backhaul, limited channel knowledge at <b>base</b> <b>station</b> <b>and</b> <b>terminal</b> side, and a per-antenna power constraint. We derive inner capacity bounds for different cooperation schemes through uplink/downlink duality and provide numerical results showing the superiority of certain cooperation schemes in terms of rate/backhaul tradeoff for different interference scenarios.

Limited Internet access, at very low speeds, is already available as an enhancement to some existing cellular systems. However, those systems were designed {{with the purpose of}} providing voice services and- at most- short messaging, but not fast data transfers. In fact, as shown in this article, traditional wireless technologies are not very well suited to meet the demanding requirements of providing very high data rates with the ubiquity, mobility, and portability characteristic of cellular systems. Increased use of antenna arrays appears to be the only means of enabling the types of data rates and capacities needed for wireless Internet and multimedia services.

30|$|We have {{presented}} practical linear coordinated transmit-receive zero forcing schemes for the uplink of cellular multiuser MIMO {{systems in the}} TDD mode. Beam selection {{is an integral part}} of the strategy, as it helps to avoid excessive zero forcing loss while achieving gain from multiuser diversity. The BS computes the transmission parameters in a centralized manner and employs DL pilot signals to convey the information of the beam selection and beamformers to be used by the terminals. When coexisting with the DL transmit-receive zero forcing, the precoded DL demodulation pilots can be reused for UL beam allocation so that no additional pilot overhead is required. In order to reduce the UL pilot overhead as well, we proposed reusing the precoded UL demodulation pilots in turn for partial CSI sounding. As a result, only the precoded pilot symbols are needed in both UL and DL to satisfy the needs of both transmission and reception. The system is readily scalable, since any combination of <b>base</b> <b>station</b> <b>and</b> <b>terminal</b> antenna array setups can be supported.|$|E

The main objective of METRA was the performance evaluation of multi-antenna terminals in combination with adaptive antennas at the base station in UMTS communication systems. 1 A MIMO channel sounder was developed that provided realistic multi-antenna channel measurements. Using these measured data, stochastic channel models were developed and properly validated. These models were also evaluated in order to estimate their corresponding channel capacity. Different MIMO configurations and processing schemes were developed for both the FDD and TDD modes of UTRA, and their link performance was assessed. Performance evaluation was completed by system simulations that illustrated the benefits of MIMO configurations to the network operator.

This process is carried out at the receiver; the decision on the favoured scheme is then signalled to the transmitter via a low-rate feedback link.

In our trials, two terminals are served in two overlapping cells and placed in specific indoor, outdoor-to-indoor and outdoor scenarios. We have realized both intra-site as well as inter-site CoMP.

30|$|In the new {{generation}} of broadband mobile communication systems, multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) technique [1, 2] and heterogeneous networks [3 – 5] are key methods to enable the fast and reliable wireless communication access. On one hand, MIMO provides increased channel capacity and data rate using multiple antennas on both <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> <b>and</b> <b>terminals.</b> On the other hand, heterogeneous networks use hybrid networks with lower power nodes (pico, femto cells) and main nodes (macro cells) to achieve high-frequency efficiency and system capacity. The topology of a typical heterogeneous network consists of one macro cell and several pico/femto cells sharing the same frequency within the one area. Such networks bring co-channel interferences (CCI) which need to be eliminated in wireless communications [6 – 8]. For instance, users of the pico/femto cells are affected by the strong power signal from the macro cell, whereas high power terminals at the edge of macro and pico/femto cells produce strong interferences to the surrounding pico/femto cells. It is worthwhile to investigate methods to reduce or eliminate the CCI especially after MIMO be introduced to the heterogeneous networks.|$|R

To enable <b>terminal</b> mobility <b>and</b> reduce temporal dispersion, {{we use a}} configuration known as Multi-Spot-Diffusing (MSD), which is a Multi-Input, Multi-Output (MIMO) architecture. In this configuration, a transmitter generates multiple narrow beams that get uniformly spread over a reflection surface accessible to a service area. A multi-branch receiver with each branch having access to a diffusing spot (generated by transmitter) combines signals on its branches. This scheme creates multiple virtually ideal communications channels between a <b>base</b> <b>station</b> <b>and</b> <b>terminals.</b> This paper considers issues involved {{in the design of}} a transmitter-based holographic spot array generator. The generator produces equally-spaced diffusing spots on the room ceiling and/or walls. To overcome power limitation set by eye safety requirements, a receiver optical concentrator is proposed. Furthermore, to improve receiver signal-to-noise ratio, an optical filter that rejects optical noise is needed. Thus, functionally receiver branch optical front-end consists of an optical concentrator and an optical band-pass filter. A single holographic optical element, capable of performing both functions is proposed. Link performance is investigated by providing equivalent link model and comparing probability of error for a bare and a holographic receiver.

40|$|In HiperAccess, the {{scheduling}} problem takes two forms; firstly, the <b>base</b> <b>station</b> reserves capacity on the uplink {{for the different}} <b>terminals,</b> <b>and</b> secondly, the <b>terminals</b> schedule their respective traffic in its assigned share of the channel capacity.

40|$|Abstract — In {{wireless}} transmission the randomness {{of the communication}} channel leads to random fluctuation in the received signal. This fluctuation known as fading. The fading is a fundamental problem in wireless communications because of this fading effect we cannot get exact signal at the receiver side.

For reasonable radio environment, practical antenna patterns and choices of system parameters, our performance analysis shows that the ESRA method provides 98. 69 % coverage, and yields a maximum downlink throughput of 36. 10 % per sector with success probability of one for packet transmission in terms of meeting a 15 dB threshold for signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). As for the uplink, using full power control, the throughput can reach 16. 7 % per sector with a packet loss probability of less than 5 x 10 − 4. The ESRA performance is compared favorably to existing methods such as the CPDA scheme [BFZA 96] and the SRA method [FHLQS 98]. The high ESRA throughput translates into a very large network capacity. In addition to data services, the high quality of service reveals the applicability of the new method to support real-time traffic such as voice and video.
