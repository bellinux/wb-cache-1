5|$|The Bulls {{began their}} next drive {{at their own}} 26-yard line, but went three-and-out. Buffalo punter Peter Fardon kicked the <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> the head of UConn {{returner}} Jasper Howard; rather than let the ball go, he ran backwards chasing after it. Trying to grab the <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, he muffed the catch, and the ball bounced into the end zone, where it was recovered by Buffalo's Ray Anthony Long for a Bull touchdown. The special-teams miscue by Howard allowed Buffalo {{to tie the game}} at 10–10 with 11:36 remaining in the second quarter.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} in the game came from special teams and turnovers. Virginia Tech turned the <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> three times, while Kansas turned the <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> just once. Kansas converted its three takeaways into 17points, giving the Jayhawks an enormous advantage on the scoreboard. Virginia Tech failed to convert its sole turnover recovery into any points.|$|E
5|$|In the Purdue game, Robinson {{turned the}} <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> four times (two interceptions and two lost fumbles) in heavy rain and gusting wind. Robinson was also {{held to a}} season-low 68 rushing yards against Purdue.|$|E

25|$|Since 1979/80, all Test cricket {{has been}} played with six <b>balls</b> per <b>over.</b> However, overs in Test cricket {{originally}} had four <b>balls</b> per <b>over,</b> {{and there have}} been varying numbers of <b>balls</b> per <b>over</b> around the world up to 1979/80, generally the same as the number of <b>balls</b> per <b>over</b> in force in other first-class cricket in that country.|$|R
5|$|The Lobos gained {{three more}} first downs on their final drive, but {{were unable to}} score again before turning the <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> on downs. The Midshipmen ran one more quarterback kneel play to run out the clock, winning {{the game with a}} final score of 34–19.|$|E
5|$|The pass fell incomplete, and Tech {{turned the}} <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> on downs with four seconds remaining. Rather than attempt to {{score on the}} final play of the half, the Tide offense took a knee and ended the half with Virginia Tech leading, 107.|$|E
5|$|The try at goal failed, but the ball, {{instead of}} going to the Cliftons behind the line, fell into the field and into the hands of one of the Academy team. By a quick decisive run, he again got the <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> the Cliftons goal line and scored a touchdown.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech {{turned the}} <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> twice—once on a fumble and once on an interception. The two {{turnovers}} resulted in twotouchdowns for Florida State, {{and the resulting}} 14 points were greater than Florida State's margin of victory. The Seminoles did not turn the <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> during the game. Both teams were highly penalized during the game. Virginia Tech finished with 17penalties for 143yards, while Florida State was penalized 12times for 114yards. The penalties affected each team's ability to convert third downs, as Virginia Tech was only able to convert 9of 20third-down attempts, while Florida State was successful on just 3of its 13attempts. Despite trailing {{for much of the}} game and running a pass-heavy offense, Virginia Tech dominated the game's time of possession, controlling the ball for over 35of the game's 60minutes.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's leading rusher was Eddie Hunter, {{who carried}} the ball 12times for 75yards. Tech quarterback Mark Cox {{finished}} the game having completed just {{six of his}} 17passes for 50passing yards and one interception. In total, Tech turned the <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> four times—twice via interceptions and twice via lost fumbles.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the punt, Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan connected on a 31-yard pass to wide receiver Brandon Robinson. As before, however, the offense stalled. On 4th-and-1 from the Virginia Tech 30-yard line, Ryan attempted a pass that fell incomplete, turning the <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> on downs. As {{a result of}} pressure applied by the Boston College defense, the Hokies continued to have difficulty moving the ball.|$|E
2500|$|Four <b>ball</b> <b>overs</b> {{gave way}} to five <b>ball</b> <b>overs</b> in the 1890s and to six <b>ball</b> <b>overs</b> in Australia, as the game {{continued}} to develop quickly. England won the 1890 Ashes series 2–0, although Jack Barrett carried his bat for 67 through Australia's second innings of 176 at Lord's. [...] W. G. Grace was out second ball in the first innings but saw England home in the second with 75*. [...] Frederick Martin took 12 Australian wickets for 102 but 'Nutty' never played an Ashes match again. The third scheduled match, at Old Trafford, was the first Test to be abandoned without a ball being bowled.|$|R

5|$|Both teams' {{defenses}} {{controlled the}} third quarter, allowing no points to be scored. Navy's McKee completed three more pass plays before his first incompletion, which came on his fourteenth attempt. Washington's offense had little {{success in the}} third quarter, being held to {{only a few yards}} gained and turning the <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> once. In the fourth quarter, after several unsuccessful drives by each team, Navy made a major error. After being stopped on their own 26-yard line, Navy improperly lined up in a punt formation, and the center snapped the <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> the punter's head. The ball was recovered by Washington on the Navy ten-yard line. Washington lost two yards in three plays, and faced a fourth down from the Navy 12-yard line. Washington stacked their offensive line, allowing their left guard, James Bryan, to become an eligible receiver. Fred Abel passed the ball to Bryan, who caught it just short of the goal line and walked into the end zone for the touchdown. Washington's kicker then converted the extra point, tying the game at 14.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut {{dominated}} Buffalo statistically in {{the first}} half, gaining 225yards to the Bulls' 94, led by Donald Brown's 208yardsrushing. Buffalo won the turnover battle however, recovering five UConn fumbles. The Bulls scored 20points off UConn turnovers {{in the first}} half, but were held scoreless {{in the second half}} when the Huskies stopped turning the <b>ball</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E
5|$|Florida State's offense {{began work}} from its 36-yard line, but ran four plays without gaining {{a first down}} and turned the <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> on downs. Virginia Tech, whose offense began at the Florida State 45-yard line, {{proceeded}} to run down the clock. In eight plays, Tech advanced 21 yards and drained 3:22, then turned the <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> on downs at the Seminole 26-yard line. Florida State's offense entered the game one final time and conducted a 12-play, 75-yard drive that ended with a 20-yard pass from Manuel to running back Chris Thompson for a touchdown. The score and subsequent extra point made the score 44–33, but only seven seconds remained in the game. The Seminoles attempted an onside kick {{in an attempt to}} have another opportunity for offense, but the Hokies recovered the kick and proceeded to run out the final seconds, earning a 44–33 victory.|$|E

5|$|Geen excelled athletically at Oxford, earning four Blues between 1910 and 1913. However, {{in three}} {{successive}} Varsity Matches, {{he failed to}} score after dropping the <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> the tryline. In the holidays, he played club rugby for Newport, and {{he was part of}} the team that defeated the touring South African side of 1912–1913. He was also a decent cricketer keeping wicket for Oxford University Authentics and Monmouthshire.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{kicked the}} game off, and also {{fashioned}} {{the first chance}} of the game; Ronaldo beat Lauren on the left wing to put over a cross, only for Scholes to head the <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> the crossbar after losing his marker. Two minutes later, a break from José Antonio Reyes had Carroll scampering across from his goal to meet the Spaniard, forcing Reyes wide enough to allow the United defence time to get back.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United's {{opponents in}} the fourth round was Middlesbrough. Rooney scored twice in the team's 3–0 victory – he lobbed the <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer for his first goal and volleyed it for his second. Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren {{credited}} Rooney's performance afterwards and said he made {{the difference in the}} tie. Everton hosted Manchester United in the next round at Goodison Park. A goal apiece from Quinton Fortune and Ronaldo in either half ensured a 2–0 win.|$|E

5|$|Navy hit paydirt but {{the referee}} found {{something}} illegal {{and called the}} ball back, much {{to the consternation of}} the Cadet rooters. But on the next play George Hayward kicked a field goal, making the score 14 to 11. Just before the game ended a double pass, Bill Cloke to captain Clarence Stone, carried to <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> the Hopkins goal for the 4 points that won the game.|$|E
5|$|After {{each team}} traded punts {{on their first}} {{possession}}s, Arkansas long snapper Will Coleman snapped the <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> the head of punter Dylan Breeding that gave Alabama possession at the Razorbacks' six-yard line. On the next play, Eddie Lacy scored on a six-yard run for a 7–0 Crimson Tide lead. The Razorbacks responded with an eight-play, 51-yard drive, but failed to score any points after a 41-yard Zach Hocker field goal hit the left upright. Each team again traded punts before the Crimson Tide extended their lead to 10–0 {{early in the second}} quarter on a 51-yard Cade Foster field goal.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking a}} single point from their opening two games, Scotland had to defeat the Netherlands by three clear goals to progress. Despite the Dutch taking the lead, Scotland fought back to win 3–2 with a goal from Kenny Dalglish and two from Archie Gemmill, the second of which is {{considered}} one of the greatest World Cup goals ever; Gemmill beat three Dutch defenders before lifting the <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> goalkeeper Jan Jongbloed into the net. The victory was not sufficient to secure a place in the second round, and Scotland were eliminated on goal difference for the second successive World Cup.|$|E
