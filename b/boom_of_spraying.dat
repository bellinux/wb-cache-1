40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} study, the {{microstructural}} features, wear characteristics, and corrosion behaviour <b>of</b> <b>spray</b> cast Al– 12 Si, Al– 15 Si, and Al– 20 Si alloys have been investigated. The alloys were spray cast and hot isostatically pressed. Hot isostatic pressing has considerably reduced the porosity in spray cast alloys. The microstructure <b>of</b> <b>spray</b> cast alloys showed fine and globular-shaped Si {{particles in the}} Al matrix in contrast to needle-type eutectic Si and blocky-type primary Si in the Al matrix in chill cast alloys. The dry sliding wear tests showed that the wear rates <b>of</b> <b>spray</b> cast alloys are invariably lower and the potentiodynamic polarization tests showed that the corrosion resistance <b>of</b> <b>spray</b> cast alloys is considerably {{higher than that of}} chill cast alloys. The high wear and corrosion resistance <b>of</b> <b>spray</b> cast alloys have been discussed {{in the light of the}} microstructural modification induced during the spray casting process...|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} {{concern about}} environmental effect of off-target deposits of pesticides use {{has resulted in}} the development <b>of</b> numerous <b>spray</b> drift models. Statistical models based on experimental field studies are used to estimate off-target deposits for different sprayers in various environmental conditions. Random-walk and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models have been used to predict the effect of operational parameters and were extensively validated in wind tunnel. A third group, Gaussian dispersion models have been used for several years for the environmental assessment <b>of</b> the pesticide <b>spray</b> drift, mainly for aerial application. When these models were used for the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>boom</b> sprayer <b>spray</b> drift, their predictions were found unreliable in the short range, were the initial release conditions of the droplets {{have a significant effect on}} the spray deposits. For longer ranges, the results were found consistent with the field measurements as the characteristics of the source have a reduced influence on the small droplets drift. Three major parameters must be taken into account in order to define realistic initial conditions of the droplets in a spray drift model: the <b>spray</b> pattern <b>of</b> the nozzle, the boom movements and the effect of entrained air and droplet velocities. To take theses parameters into account in a Gaussian model, the nozzle droplet size distribution measured with a Malvern laser particle analyser was used to divide the nozzle output into several size classes. The <b>spray</b> deposits <b>of</b> each diameter class was computed for each successive position of the nozzle combining the nozzle spray distribution with drift computed with a Gaussian tilting plume model. The summation of these footprints resulted in the global drift of the nozzle. For increasing droplet size, the release height used in the Gaussian model was decreased from nozzle height to ground level using an experimental law to take into account the effect of entrained air and droplet initial velocity. The experimental law was adjusted on 2 m/s wind tunnel measurements and robustness was evaluated for 1 and 4 m/s...|$|R

In this paper droplet trajectory models and plant architecture models are combined using three-dimensional computer modeling techniques to develop a probabilistic model <b>of</b> turbulence-related <b>spray</b> transport around various plant architectures. The plant architecture model utilises a set of growth rules expressed in the Lindenmayer systems (L-systems) formalism linked to a C++ environmental program to determine the interception <b>of</b> <b>spray</b> droplets by the various vegetative elements.

The effect of the varying quantity <b>of</b> <b>spray</b> solution on the structural, electrical, morphological and optical properties of MgSe thin films was investigated. The X-ray diffraction studies revealed that the deposited MgSe has a cubic lattice with (111) as the preferred orientation. The optical studies showed that the deposited MgSe exhibited direct optical band gap which varied from 2. 45 to 2. 75 eV depending on the quantity <b>of</b> <b>spray</b> solution.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the influence <b>of</b> <b>spray</b> position on fuel air mixing quality, three-dimensional numerical simulation of the working process of a heavy-duty diesel was conducted. To quantitatively study the mechanism of the effect <b>of</b> <b>spray</b> position on fuel air mixing process, the deviation <b>of</b> <b>spray</b> centroid was introduced to describe the spray position change in combustion chamber. The {{results show that the}} gas intake swirl can affect the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>spray</b> in combustion chamber under three directions in cylindrical coordinate, in which the circumferential distribution is affected most. It then can be concluded that the spray can be limited to the vicinity of the combustion chamber axis. Better spray position, which is more helpful for the process of fuel air mixing and combustion, can be achieved by using optimal swirl, so that the power performance will be improved...|$|R

There will be a specific fiber volume ratio for sprayed FRP to obtain the best tensile mechanical property. The increase of fiber length can lead to better tensile performance, while that of composite thickness results in property degradation.
