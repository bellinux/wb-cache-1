40|$|Clustering and {{aggregation}} inherently increase wireless {{sensor network}} (WSN) lifetime by collecting information within a cluster at a cluster head, {{reducing the amount of}} data through computation, then forwarding it. Traditional approaches, however, both spend extensive communication energy to identify the cluster heads and are inflexible to network dynamics such as those arising from sink mobility, node failure, or dwindling <b>battery</b> <b>reserves.</b> This paper presents CLIQUE, an approach for data clustering that saves cluster head selection energy by using machine learning to enable nodes to independently {{decide whether or not to}} act as a cluster head on a per-packet basis. We refer to this lack of actual cluster head assignment as being role-free, and demonstrate through simulations that, when combined with learning dynamic network properties such as <b>battery</b> <b>reserves,</b> up to 25 % less energy is consumed in comparison to a traditional, random cluster head selection approach. 1...|$|R

This full body armor is equipped with electronic devices which absorb microwave energy and can convert it for use as blasts of heat or concussive force. Its solar powered boot jets enable the wearer to fly at just under Mach 1, with range limited only by available light plus 3 hour <b>battery</b> <b>reserve.</b> The gauntlets contain microwave projectors that generate devastating force blasts. Because the battle-suit draws power from microwave energy beamed down from a satellite located in geosynchronous orbit, the suit's wearer must maintain a line-of-sight position relative to the satellite to avoid sudden power cut-off. The satellite itself was protected by ECMs which rendered it invisible to conventional modes of detection.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a micro power {{battery state of charge}} monitor. The novelty of this design lies in the extreme low power consumption and accurate prediction of the <b>battery</b> <b>reserve</b> time. The average current drawn is successfully limited to 60 µA, which is significantly smaller than those in currently available devices. The proposed design predicts the reserved battery charge with an accuracy of 5 % under different discharge conditions. The automated learning scheme using software is utilized. Protection of the battery against excessive current drain and usage outside the specified temperature range is incorporated. This paper details the proposed technique adopted for power reduction. The battery temperature and current sensing circuits are normally in power down mode, they go into active mode for the microcontroller to take measurements. An ON/OFF ratio of 1 : 153 is achieved which results in power reduction by a factor of 59. 30. The average current requirement of the proposed design is reduced from 3302. 79 µA to 55. 69 µA with the adoption of power reduction approach. The proposed design has been tested on a NiMH, NiCd and Li-Ion battery packs and the experimental results confirm the utility of the proposed design 1.

30|$|The {{satellite}} {{is powered}} by body-mounted solar panels that feed the EPS for storage and distribution of power.

The lack of extraneous projected area also reduces the possibility of atmospheric buffeting. Orbit averaged power is 11  W assuming 80 % sun-tracking efficiency. As transmission experiments are performed during eclipse, the EPS must be able to support the payload power draw using <b>battery</b> <b>reserves</b> alone. A 30  WHr lithium-ion battery pack has been sized to support mission operations with sufficient depth of discharge margin to prevent cell degradation from repeated experimental runs.|$|R

40|$|International audienceHuman context {{recognition}} (HCR) from {{on-body sensor}} networks {{is an important}} and challenging task for many healthcare applications because it offers continuous monitoring capability of both personal and environmental parameters. However, these systems still face a major energy issue that prevent their wide adoption. Indeed, in healthcare applications, sensors are used to capture data during daily life or extended stays in hospital. Thus, continuous sampling and communication tasks quickly deplete sensors' <b>battery</b> <b>reserves,</b> and frequent <b>battery</b> replacement are not convenient. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop energy-efficient solutions for long-term monitoring applications in order to foster the acceptance of these technologies by the patients. In this paper, we survey existing energy-efficient approaches designed for HCR based on wearable sensor networks. We propose a new classification of the energy-efficient mechanisms for health-related human context recognition applications and we review the related works in details. Moreover, we provide a qualitative comparison of these solutions in terms of energy-consumption, recognition accuracy and latency. Finally, we discuss open research issue and give directions for future works...|$|R
40|$|In {{wireless}} sensor networks, a few sensor nodes end {{up being}} vulnerable to potentially rapid depletion of the <b>battery</b> <b>reserves</b> due to either their central location or just the traffic patterns generated by the application. Traditional energy management strategies, such as those which use topology control algorithms, reduce the energy consumed at each node to the minimum necessary. In this paper, we use a different approach that balances the energy consumption {{at each of the}} nodes, thus increasing the functional lifetime of the network. We propose a new distributed dynamic topology control algorithm called Energy Balanced Topology Control (EBTC) which considers the actual energy consumed for each transmission and reception to achieve the goal of an increased functional lifetime. We analyze the algorithm’s computational and communication complexity and show that it is equivalent or lower in complexity to other dynamic topology control algorithms. Using an empirical model of energy consumption, we show that the EBTC algorithm increases the lifetime of a wireless sensor network by over 40 % compared to the best of previously known algorithms. ar X i...|$|R
