5|$|The general {{goal of a}} {{level is}} to gain control over every village on an island, {{accomplished}} through acts that persuade the villagers {{to believe in the}} player. Villagers can <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> <b>by</b> everything from assistance with day-to-day tasks to being terrorised by fireballs and lightning storms. Artefacts (special objects that glow in their owner's colour) and missionary disciples can be used to impress villagers. Villagers become bored with repetitive attempts to impress them. For example, if boulders fly overhead too frequently, their effect is lost. This forces the player to use multiple methods to convert a village.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{publication}} of the bull, the election of the pope was often decided by a puppet electoral process. The Holy Roman Emperor often directly named a deceased pope’s replacement, or the pontiff named his own successor. Such a nomination under the canon law was not a valid election and the legal electors would have to ratify the choice, though undoubtedly they would naturally <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> <b>by</b> circumstances to give effect to the imperial preference.|$|E
25|$|Jerusalem {{was still}} being rebuilt {{following}} the destruction caused by Titus in AD 70. Emperor Hadrian had built during the 130s a temple over the site of Jesus's tomb near Calvary, and renamed the city Aelia Capitolina. Accounts differ concerning whether the temple was dedicated to Venus or Jupiter. According to tradition, Helena ordered the temple torn down and, according to the legend that arose {{at the end of}} the 4th century, chose a site to begin excavating, which led to the recovery of three different crosses. The legend is recounted in Ambrose, On the Death of Theodosius (died 395) and at length in Rufinus' chapters appended to his translation into Latin of Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History, the main body of which does not mention the event. Then, Rufinus relates, the empress refused to <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> <b>by</b> anything short of solid proof and performed a test. Possibly through Bishop Macarius of Jerusalem, she had a woman who was near death brought from the city. When the woman touched the first and second crosses, her condition did not change, but when she touched the third and final cross she suddenly recovered, and Helena declared the cross with which the woman had been touched to be the True Cross. On the site of discovery, Constantine ordered the building of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; churches were also built on other sites detected by Helena. Sozomen and Theodoret claim that Helena also found the nails of the crucifixion. To use their miraculous power to aid her son, Helena allegedly had one placed in Constantine's helmet, and another in the bridle of his horse.|$|E

Ultimately, Geddes (IGN) wrote that an {{expansion}} pack on the original game would have served the same function. Even with Trouble in Paradise upgraded controls, Bramwell (Eurogamer) preferred the precision of the Nintendo DS version's stylus or of a computer mouse, and thought the game could be further simplified. However, he saw the new release as a more polished opportunity to attract an audience that was not originally convinced by the reception of the first game.

Rare Replay was also the first top-ranked budget title since Wii Fit Plus (2009) before it fell to sixth place the next week.

500|$|From {{the outset}} of the marriage, {{political}} members of the Rothschild family took an interest in Rosebery, and he was soon acclaimed as one of the rising hopes of the Liberal Party. As a hereditary peer, he already had a seat in the House of Lords and had made his maiden speech there on attaining his majority. But brilliant as he was, Rosebery tended to lethargy and boredom. Lord Granville in fact considered Rosebery's wife to be the more ambitious of the pair, and even advised her [...] "If you keep him up to the mark, [...] is sure to have his page in history." [...] The subtle driving of her often languid and lethargic husband to achieve his [...] "page in history" [...] was to become her [...] Rosebery's secretary Thomas Gilmour noted: [...] "She is thoroughly genuine and very tender and devoted to Lord Rosebery, {{it is easy to see}} that she is very proud of him, and she is a woman of considerable force of character and great energy, she may prove to be a powerful ally in his political career." [...] Rosebery was not a natural politician. He was an idealist who disliked the rancour of politics, in fact [...] "his innate dislike of politics was something Lady Rosebery always fought against." [...] However, he was a gifted orator, and this was an era when platform speaking was beginning to replace House of Commons debate. On a tour of America before his marriage, Rosebery had been impressed by the campaigning of prospective political candidates; in Britain little had changed in that respect since the hustings of the 18th century. He realised how an electorate could <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> <b>by</b> a candidate touring his prospective constituency, aided by a well thought-out series of events, rallies and advertising, with the candidate's ideal and attractive family smiling by his side. Thus Lady Rosebery not only pushed and encouraged him behind the scenes but was now to become an encouraging and conspicuous figure by his side. In this way it could be said she was the first openly [...] "political wife" [...] in Britain.|$|E

2500|$|In Singapore, an [...] "inherent tendency" [...] {{test has}} been held to strike the right balance between the right to {{freedom of speech and}} expression, and the need to protect the dignity and {{integrity}} of the courts. To establish the offence, it is sufficient if the claimant can prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act or words complained of have an inherent tendency to interfere with the administration of justice. An act or statement has such an inherent tendency if it conveys to an average reasonable reader or viewer allegations of bias, lack of impartiality, impropriety or any wrongdoing concerning a judge (and a fortiori, a court) in the exercise of his judicial function.

2500|$|A common view among {{early and}} renaissance Republican theorists was that {{democracy}} could only survive in small political communities. Heeding {{the lessons of}} the Roman Republic's shift to monarchism as it grew larger, these Republican theorists held that the expansion of territory and population inevitably led to tyranny. Democracy was therefore highly fragile and rare historically, as it could only survive in small political units, which due to their size were vulnerable to conquest by larger political units. Montesquieu famously said, [...] "if a republic is small, it is destroyed by an outside force; if it is large, it is destroyed by an internal vice." [...] Rousseau asserted, [...] "It is, therefore the natural property of small states to be governed as a republic, of middling ones to be subject to a monarch, and of large empires to <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> <b>by</b> a despotic prince." ...|$|E

2500|$|Conducător Antonescu thought Hitler {{willing to}} revise his stance on Northern Transylvania, and {{claimed to have}} {{obtained}} the German leader's agreement, using it to justify participation on the Eastern Front after the recovery of Bessarabia. However, transcripts of the Hitler-Antonescu conversations do not validate his interpretation. Another version has it that Hitler sent Antonescu a letter informing him that Bessarabia's political status still ultimately depended on German decisions. In one of his letters to Hitler, Antonescu himself stated his anti-communist ideological motivation: [...] "I confirm that I will pursue operations in the east to the end against that great enemy of civilization, of Europe, and of my country: Russian Bolshevism [...] I will not <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> <b>by</b> anyone not to extend this military cooperation into new territory." [...] Antonescu's ideological perspective blended national sentiment with generically Christian and particularly Romanian Orthodox traits. British historian Arnold D. Harvey writes that while this ideology seems a poor match with Nazi doctrine, especially its anti-religious elements, [...] "It seems that Hitler was not even perturbed by the militant Christian orientation of the Antonescu regime".|$|E
2500|$|Early in August 1939 [...] {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} addressing his ideas to the various army chiefs of staff by themselves, in other words without their Commander-in-Chief, at the Berghof. From the shadows I was probably {{in the best position}} to study its effect and I realised that he had failed to achieve his object: for while General von Wietersheim [...] was the only one to find his tongue enough to show by his questions how little he agreed with what Hitler had outlined, this in itself probably crystallised in Hitler's mind the suspicion that he was confronted with an iron phalanx of men who inwardly refused to <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> <b>by</b> any speech they thought was just a propaganda speech.Keitel believed that Hitler's [...] "pronounced distaste for the General Staff" [...] and [...] "its 'caste' arrogance", which would become something of an obsession of his later, was in part a result of this meeting and Wietersheim's comments. Hitler no doubt considered Wietersheim's disagreements with him as a kind of treason: in 1946 Manstein told the Nuremberg tribunal that after the August 1938 incident Hitler no longer allowed the military to directly question any of his decisions.|$|E
2500|$|A {{member of}} the 3rd Battalion, Unit “D” Company, Dublin Brigade, Whelan fought under Commandant Éamon De Valera. Occupying Boland's Bakery {{around the corner from}} the flour mill on Grand Canal Street, and a mile to the {{south-east}} of the GPO, the 3rd battalion headquarters was at a key location, controlling as it did the railway line and the main road from Dún Laoghaire (then known as Kingstown) to the centre of the city. Throughout the Rising the 3rd Battalion was to cover a large area of South Dublin, with a lot more men expected to report for duty than actually did so on the day. The severely depleted numbers were the result of countermanding orders issued by Eoin MacNeill advising the Volunteers not to take part in the Rising. MacNeill had learnt of the arrest of Roger Casement and the subsequent loss of German arms. After confronting Patrick Pearse, who refused to <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> <b>by</b> this revelation, MacNeill felt he had no option but to place a last minute news advertisement calling the Rising off. This caused tremendous confusion among the Volunteers, especially outside of Dublin. For those that did show up, the British, reportedly, [...] "considered De Valera's forces the best trained and best led among the rebels".|$|E
