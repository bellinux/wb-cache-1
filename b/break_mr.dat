60|$|The ice cracked ominously, {{but did not}} <b>break.</b> <b>Mr.</b> Strong {{warned the}} others still further back.|$|E
60|$|John Thorndyke {{opened the}} {{shutters}} of the parlor window, {{and stepped out}} into the garden alone, for the Rector was too unnerved and shattered to go out with him, but threw himself on the sofa, completely prostrated. Half an hour later the Squire re-entered the room. The morning was just beginning to <b>break.</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bastow raised his head and looked sadly at him.|$|E
60|$|Anne was {{charging}} {{through the}} grain like a mad thing. Diana hopped briskly down, tied the horse securely to a post, turned the skirt of her pretty gingham dress over her shoulders, mounted the fence, and started {{in pursuit of}} her frantic friend. She could run faster than Anne, who was hampered by her clinging and drenched skirt, and soon overtook her. Behind them they left a trail that would <b>break</b> <b>Mr.</b> Harrison's heart when he should see it.|$|E
5000|$|April 2016 - After 10 {{years as}} head teacher, Mrs. Jo Manson made the {{decision}} to leave the High Arcal School in April (Easter Term <b>Break).</b> <b>Mrs</b> Jo Bull, the former deputy head, is her successor.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have all}} been forced to endure a sad experience," [...] said Ozma, [...] "and so I am anxious to do all {{in my power to}} <b>break</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Yoop's enchantments. But first tell me how you {{happened}} to stray into that lonely Valley where Yoop Castle stands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Notwithstanding {{every effort}} {{the hour of}} four o’clock arrived, and the {{preparation}} was scarcely completed. After a careful inspection of the final preparations, I was forced to relinquish the plan for that morning, as dawn was <b>breaking.</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hobson begged to try it at all hazards.|$|R
6000|$|Now Dr. Oldenberg, it seems, uses such {{comparisons}} of savage and Aryan faiths. Dr. Oldenberg is (i. 209) {{one of several}} 'very thoughtful scholars' who do so, who <b>break</b> <b>Mr.</b> Max Muller's prohibition. Yet (ii. 220) 'no true scholar would accept any comparison' between savage fables and the folklore of Homer and the Vedas 'as really authoritative until fully demonstrated on both sides.' Well, it is 'fully demonstrated,' or 'a very thoughtful scholar' (like Dr. Oldenberg) would not accept it. Or it is not demonstrated, and then Dr. Oldenberg, though 'a very thoughtful,' is not 'a true scholar.' ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was a day}} in {{the period}} of early boyhood that {{remained}} as fresh on the memory of young Sinton {{as if it had been}} yesterday--the day on which his mother died. The desolation of his early home on that day was like the rising of a dark thunder-cloud on a bright sky. His young heart was crushed, his mind stunned, and the first ray of light that broke upon him--the first gush of relief--was when his uncle arrived and took him on his knee, and, seated beside the bed where that cold, still form lay, wept upon the child's neck as if his heart would <b>break.</b> <b>Mr</b> Shirley buried the sister whom he had been too late to see alive. Then he and his little nephew left the quiet country village and went to dwell in the great city of London. From that time forward Mr Shirley was a father to Ned, who loved him more than any one else on earth, and through his influence he was early led to love and reverence his heavenly Father and his blessed Redeemer.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} again objects. Mr. Schneider decides he's {{had enough}} and simply moves on. His attempts to <b>break</b> <b>Mr.</b> Ujaama's conviction {{that he was}} innocent of supporting known terrorists were a complete failure.|$|E
60|$|She {{had just}} come in, and opening the door had started back in {{surprise}} at seeing Liza on the bed, all tears. Liza made no answer, but cried as if her heart were <b>breaking.</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Kemp went {{up to her and}} tried to look at her face.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have all}} great {{reason to be}} thankful that Providence {{interposed}} to save you," [...] said Mrs. Thomas, in her most serious tone. Had Providence interposed to <b>break</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Thomas's collar-bone, {{or at least to}} do her some serious outward injury, what a comfort it would be, thought Mary Snow.|$|R

50|$|Sooky and Skippy {{spend the}} next two days selling bottles, {{lemonade}} and wood, and staging a performance to earn money. Skippy's father doesn't want to lend them the remaining thirty cents. Then Mr. Dubbins kills their dog and Skippy blames his father for it. The next morning, Skippy gets a new bicycle from his father. But he trades the bicycle to his friend, Eloise (Mitzi Green), for her new dog. Skippy takes the dog to Sooky. Dr. Skinner has a change of heart and buys Sooky a licensed dog, finds his mother a job, and refrains from ordering Shantytown destroyed, instead offering assistance to its citizens. For the first time, Dr. Skinner plays with Skippy in Shantytown. There they accidentally <b>break</b> <b>Mr.</b> Nubbins' new windshield. Dr. Skinner wins a fight against Mr. Nubbins and shows that he is a good father.|$|E
5000|$|Homer, Lenny and Carl {{decide to}} <b>break</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns {{out of prison}} when they realize that Smithers's present {{behavior}} is even worse than that of Burns, {{even to the point}} of instead of releasing the hounds, he releases wolverines. The three disguise themselves as prison guards, sneak into the institution and remove Burns from his cell. Mr. Burns, however, does not want to leave because he believes he has found his spiritual home. When the cellmate tries to stop them from escaping, Mr. Burns realizes that he misses being a power figure and that his toilet-tank baptism did not purge away all of his inner evil, stating that he forgot to suck some evil from between his toes, which had then multiplied rapidly and made him [...] "a bigger bastard than ever". But Mr. Burns also wonders genuinely why his cellmate helped him; he is told that after killing so many rich white men over the years, he figured he would do right by at least one of them. The two men decide they are not so different and part company. Burns uses his money to leave the prison system, and is once again at the helm of the nuclear power plant, although he hopes his friend will gain another disciple. Burns' former cellmate finds a new disciple in Fat Tony.|$|E
60|$|Then a light {{seemed to}} <b>break</b> upon <b>Mr.</b> Vandeleur, {{and he laughed}} aloud.|$|R
60|$|However, I {{must have}} gone {{to sleep in the}} course of time, because the next thing I was aware of was the fact that day was <b>breaking,</b> <b>Mr.</b> W----gone, and Mr. Bixby at the wheel again. So it was four o'clock and all well--but me; I felt like a skinful of dry bones and all of them trying to ache at once.|$|R
6000|$|When {{they had}} rested them, and taken breath, they both fell to it again; and Mr. Great-heart with a blow fetched the giant {{down to the}} ground. [...] "Nay, hold, and let me recover," [...] quoth he. So Mr. Great-heart fairly let him get up: so to it they went again; and the giant missed but little of <b>breaking</b> <b>Mr.</b> Great-heart's skull with his club.|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Bradley asks Kate to {{come see}} him. He tells her that he has left the devil cult and will help her bring Mandy back. But Mrs. Bradley threatens Kate, saying, [...] "There are secret ways of causing pain - pain that will end in death." [...] Kate is quite ill {{by the time she}} gets home, but John arrives and his {{feelings}} for Kate <b>break</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Bradley's curse.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. and Mrs. T. Stevenson {{had been}} {{thinking}} of trying a winter at [...] Bournemouth {{for the sake of}} being near their son, a plan which was [...] eventually carried out. The health of the former was now fast and [...] painfully <b>breaking.</b> <b>Mr.</b> J. W. Alexander, the well-known American [...] artist, had been down at Skerryvore with an introduction from Mr. [...] Gosse, and had made a drawing of Stevenson's head.|$|R
50|$|Col. Carson {{continues}} {{to assist the}} Parkers {{in their search for}} Emily and the maniac. Carson produces some crude sketches of the maniac (minus a face), and is able to locate the maniac's hideout. However, Carson warns Mr. Parker that if he attempts to take justice into his own hands, it'll end badly. Ignoring his warning, the vengeance-obsessed Mr. Parker confronts the maniac at his hotel. The maniac promptly <b>breaks</b> <b>Mr.</b> Parker's neck, and tosses his lifeless body off a balcony.|$|R
50|$|Those left in {{the mission}} house feared that the two who had faced the mob had been torn to pieces. When the house was set on fire from below the {{children}} and women had to be lowered from the upper story, and Mrs. Taylor and Miss Blatchley with their escape cut off had to jump, both were seriously injured. Mr. Reid was nearly blinded for life by being struck in the eye with a brick when trying to <b>break</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Taylor s fall.|$|R
60|$|The Court being {{sat at the}} Sessions-House, the Keepers {{were sent}} for and Examin'd, and the Magistrates were in great Consternation, that so horrid a Wretch had escap'd their Justice. It being {{intended}} {{that he should have}} been brought down to the Court the last Day of the Sessions, and order'd for Execution in two or three Days after; if it appear'd that he was the Person Condemn'd for the <b>breaking</b> <b>Mr.</b> Kneebone's House, and included in the Warrant for Execution, &c.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is one of}} the {{penalties}} of having brains," [...] remarked the Tin Owl with a sigh. [...] "I have had no brains since I was a man of meat, and so I never worry. Nevertheless, I prefer my former manly form to this owl's shape and would be glad to <b>break</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Yoop's enchantment as soon as possible. I am so noisy, just now, that I disturb myself," [...] and he fluttered his wings with a clatter that echoed throughout the forest.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is {{anything}} the matter, sir?---Mr. James?--' 'Hush!' said I. 'Yes, something has happened, that I have to <b>break</b> to <b>Mrs.</b> Steerforth. She is at home?' ...|$|R
6000|$|McQueen saw her {{and said}} glumly, [...] "I should have come alone, for if you pray she is sure to <b>break</b> down. <b>Mr.</b> Dishart, could you not pray cheerfully?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I say, Maggie," [...] said Tom at last, {{lifting up}} the stand, [...] "we must keep quiet here, you know. If we <b>break</b> {{anything}} <b>Mrs.</b> Stelling'll make us cry peccavi." ...|$|R
6000|$|She saw {{the light}} of thankfulness <b>break</b> upon <b>Mr.</b> Kendal's face, and the next moment flew up to her boy's bed-side. He started up, half asleep, but crying out, Mamma, where's Gibbie?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' {{he sighed}} in his former consoling way. 'What creatures we are! To <b>break</b> up, <b>Mr.</b> Sampson, and become {{incapable}} {{of business at}} that time of life! - Any reason assigned for the melancholy fact?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Two reasons {{prevented}} them. One was {{the sudden}} <b>breaking</b> of <b>Mrs.</b> Burrows' health; {{the other reason}} was the Colonel's discovery {{that in some way}} our carefully laid plans had become known to the detectives who are seeking him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (<b>Breaks</b> down weeping.) (<b>Mrs.</b> Starkweather, during {{following}} scene, has mild but continuous shuddering {{and weeping}} hysteria.) ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The gold Virgin?" [...] he vaguely echoed. But {{it brought}} his eyes {{back to her}} as if after an instant {{he could see the}} place and the thing she named--could see her sitting there alone. [...] "While I <b>break</b> with <b>Mrs.</b> Beale?" ...|$|R
60|$|ATTEN. It {{is worthy}} of our remark, to take notice how God, to show his dislike of the sins of men, strikes some of them down with a blow; as the <b>breaking</b> of <b>Mr.</b> Badman's leg, for doubtless that was a stroke from heaven.|$|R
60|$|We {{have got}} the very best gang of {{servants}} in America, now. When George first came {{he was one of}} the most religious of men. He had but one fault--young George Washington's. But I have trained him; and now it fairly <b>breaks</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Clemens's heart to hear George stand at that front door and lie to the unwelcome visitor. But your time is valuable; I must not dwell upon these things.....I'll ask Warner and Harte if they'll do Blindfold Novelettes. Some time I'll simplify that plot. All it needs is that the hanging and the marriage shall not be appointed for the same day. I got over that difficulty, but it required too much MS to reconcile the thing--so the movement of the story was clogged.|$|R
60|$|The {{next moment}} {{there was a}} tinkle of <b>breaking</b> glass, and <b>Mr.</b> Caryll {{realized}} his indiscretion and turned cold.|$|R
60|$|Then, <b>breaking</b> that trance, <b>Mr.</b> Stone's {{voice rose}} again, {{trembling}} {{out into the}} night, as though blown through a reed.|$|R
