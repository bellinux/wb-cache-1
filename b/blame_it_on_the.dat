25|$|If {{a country}} now is devastated by an epidemic, we <b>blame</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lack of {{sufficient}} hygiene. So too, the wars that erupt {{here and there}} are caused by ignorance of the intellectual organisms that infect communities with hate and influence people to commit atrocities. In today's world, relying on science, we concern ourselves with preventing germ warfare while sheltering the intellectual viruses that destroy us: our intellectual foods are still polluted. We cannot afford {{to continue to be}} confused or ignorant about these invasive germs".|$|E
25|$|This {{introduction}} {{is followed}} by Creangă's rendition of interactions between his father, depicted as aloof and moody, but often amused by his boy's misbehaving, and his mother, who supervises the children directly and criticizes Ștefan for not following her lead. Indicating that he deserved the often severe punishments applied by his parents, the narrator then details his mischievousness and antics. He recounts his participation in the customs related to Saint Basil's feast (modern New Year's Day), fashioning a pig's bladder into a rattle and joining buhai players in celebrations as noisy as to irritate the settled villagers. The story also shows Nică greedily consuming all the milk his mother leaves out for souring and trying to <b>blame</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> strigoi spirits, or bothering Chiorpec the shoemaker {{to the point where}} the aging man would punish him by covering his face in terpene. In summer, the boy plans a ruse to steal cherries from his uncle's property, and makes his way into the orchard by pretending to be looking for a cousin. Caught red-handed by his aunt and chased by her through a hemp plot, he manages to escape when she gets tangled in the plants.|$|E

2500|$|A poll {{conducted}} by Grupo Reforma indicated that 56% of Mexicans disapproved of López taking the title, while only 19% approve. Sixty-three {{percent of those}} polled have also said that the former candidate has lost credibility. Other responses in the poll include 82% describing the political atmosphere in Mexico as [...] "tense", and 45% of <b>the</b> polled <b>blaming</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> PRD, with only 20% <b>blaming</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> PAN, and 25% blaming both parties. (The poll was a telephone survey of 850 adults on November 18 with 95% confidence interval of +/-3.4% margin of error.).|$|R
2500|$|In 1970, {{according}} to Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, {{agents of the}} Soviet KGB forged and sent threatening letters to Arab missions claiming {{to be from the}} JDL to discredit it. They also were ordered to bomb a target in the [...] "Negro section of New York" [...] and <b>blame</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> JDL.|$|E
2500|$|Browne {{has denied}} the deadly rampage {{was caused by}} alcohol {{intoxication}} or marital problems and said Bales was [...] "reluctant to serve." [...] According to Browne, Bales {{did not want to}} return to the front lines. Browne said, [...] "He wasn't thrilled about going on another deployment ... he was told he wasn't going back, and then he was told he was going." [...] Browne also criticized anonymous reports from government officials, stating [...] "the government {{is going to want to}} blame this on an individual rather than <b>blame</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> war." ...|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] {{is used in}} its irreverent sense, as in [...] "blowing a raspberry". Wilson commented to {{the author}} of <b>Blame</b> <b>It</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Dog: [...] "When I {{registered}} the term with the Library of Congress in 1980, they asked me, 'Why raspberry? What's the significance of that?' But since then, razz has pretty much permeated the culture. We couldn't {{have done it without}} Hollywood's help." [...] Wilson is referred to as [...] "Ye Olde Head Razzberry". The ceremony's program is modeled after the Academy Awards, but is [...] "deliberately low-end and tacky". The awards themselves typically cost US$4.79 each, {{in the form of a}} [...] "golfball-sized raspberry" [...] which sits atop a Super 8 mm film reel; the whole of which is spray-painted gold.|$|E

60|$|The {{underlying}} cause is plain enough. The economic distress {{that the world}} suffers now is the inevitable consequence of the war. Everybody knows that. But where the people differ is in regard to {{what is going to}} happen next, and what we must do about it. Here opinion takes a variety of forms. Some people <b>blame</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> German mark: by permitting their mark to fall, the Germans, it is claimed, are taking away all the business from England; the fall of the mark, by allowing the Germans to work harder and eat less than the English, is threatening to drive the English out of house and home: if the mark goes on falling still further the Germans will thereby outdo us also in music, literature and in religion. What has got to be done, therefore, is to force the Germans to lift the mark up again, and make them pay up their indemnity.|$|E
6000|$|When Erlcort once noted his {{interest}} in the fact to a floor-walker whom he happened to find at leisure, the floor-walker said, Yes, that was so; and the house did it because it was business, good business, the only good business. He was instantly enthusiastic, and he said that just in the same way, as an extension of its good faith with the public, the house had established the rule of taking back any article which a customer did not like, or did not find what she had supposed when she got it home, and refunding the money. This was the best sort of business; it held custom; the woman became a customer for life. The floor-walker laughed, and after he had told an anxious applicant, [...] "Second aisle to the left, lady; three counters back," [...] he concluded to Erlcort, [...] "I say she because a man never brings a thing back when he's made a mistake; but a woman can always <b>blame</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> house. That so?" ...|$|E
