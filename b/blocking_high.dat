50|$|A {{jet stream}} {{perturbation}} model is employed by Weather Logistics UK, which simulates {{the diversion of}} the air streams in the upper atmosphere. North Atlantic air flow modelling is simulated by combining a monthly jet stream climatology input calculated at 20 to 30°W, with different <b>blocking</b> <b>high</b> patterns. The jet stream input is generated by thermal wind balance calculations at 316mbars (6 to 9 km aloft) in the mid-latitude range from 40 to 60°N. Long term blocking patterns {{are determined by the}} weather forecaster, who identifies the likely position and strength of North Atlantic Highs from synoptic charts, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) patterns. The model is based on the knowledge that low pressure systems at the surface are steered by the fast ribbons (jet streams) of air in the upper atmosphere. The jet stream - blocking interaction model simulation examines the sea surface temperature field using data from NOAA tracked along the ocean on a path to the British Isles. The principal theory suggests that long term weather patterns act on longer time scales, so large blocking patterns are thought to appear in a similar locations repeatedly over several months. With a good knowledge of <b>blocking</b> <b>high</b> patterns, the model performs with an impressive accuracy that is useful to the end user.|$|E

5000|$|By {{early on}} October 7, Nicole had finally felt {{the effects of}} strong wind shear and quickly {{weakened}} back into a tropical storm. A new <b>blocking</b> <b>high</b> pressure area began forming to the north, driving Nicole slowly toward the south as the storm's convective pattern continued to deteriorate.

Convection oscillated in coverage and intensity throughout the day on October 9; bursts of deep convection, which at one point coalesced into a burgeoning central dense overcast, repeatedly subsided to leave the center exposed. As steering currents slackened, Nicole slowed to a drift before the retreating ridge of high pressure allowed the storm to resume a northward course.

40|$|Several {{studies show}} that the {{anomalous}} long-lasting Russian heat wave during the summer of 2010, linked to a long-persistent <b>blocking</b> <b>high,</b> appears mainly as a result of natural atmospheric variability.

The anomalous long-lasting <b>blocking</b> <b>high</b> over western Russia including the heat wave occurs as an overlay of a set of anticyclonic contributions on different time scales.
