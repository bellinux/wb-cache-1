40|$|AbstractTropical theileriosis, <b>bovine</b> {{babesiosis}} and <b>anaplasmosis</b> are tick-borne protozoan {{diseases that}} impose serious {{constraints on the}} health and productivity of domestic cattle in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. A common feature of these diseases is that, following recovery from primary infection, animals become persistent carriers of the pathogen and {{continue to play a}} critical role in disease epidemiology, acting as reservoirs of infection. This study describes development and evaluation of multiplex and single PCR assays for simultaneous detection of Theileria annulata, Babesia bovis and Anaplasma marginale in cattle. Following in silico screening for candidate target genes representing each of the pathogens, an optimised multiplex PCR assay was established using three primer sets, cytob 1, MAR 1 bB 2 and bovar 2 A, for amplification of genomic DNA of T. annulata, A. marginale and B. bovis respectively. The designed primer sets were found to be species-specific, generating amplicons of 312, 265 and 166 base pairs, respectively and were deemed suitable for the development of a multiplex assay. The sensitivity of each primer pair was evaluated using serial dilutions of parasite DNA, while specificity was confirmed by testing for amplification from DNA of different stocks of each pathogen and other Theileria, Babesia and Anaplasma species. Additionally, DNA preparations derived from field samples were used to evaluate the utility of the single and multiplex PCRs for determination of infection status. The multiplex PCR was found to detect each pathogen species with the same level of sensitivity, irrespective of whether its DNA was amplified in isolation or together with DNA representing the other pathogens. Moreover, single and multiplex PCRs were able to detect each species with equal sensitivity in serially diluted DNA representing mixtures of T. annulata, B. bovis and A. marginale, and no evidence of non-specific amplification from non-target species was observed. Validation that the multiplex PCR efficiently detects single and mixed infections from field samples was demonstrated. The developed assay represents a simple and efficient diagnostic for co-detection of tropical theileriosis, <b>bovine</b> babesiosis and <b>anaplasmosis,</b> and may be a valuable tool for epidemiological studies aimed at assessing the burden of multiple infection with tick-borne pathogens and improving control of the associated diseases in endemic regions...|$|R

The main objective {{of the study was}} to investigate the impact of reduced acaricide application on the endemic stability to bovine babesiosis (Babesia bigemina and Babesia bovis) and anaplasmosis in a sample of the local cattle population. The study should be of assistance to farmers who are attempting to move from intensive to strategic tick control strategies and reduce the frequency of dipping, whilst maintaining endemic stability. Sixty cattle per communal grazing area were bled at the beginning and the end of the experimental period and the sera were assayed for B. bovis, B. bigemina and Anaplasma antibodies. Cattle in the intensively dipped group were dipped 26 times and maintained on a fourteen-day dipping interval throughout the study, whereas, cattle in the strategic group had their acaricide application frequency reduced and were only dipped 13 times. Three cattle per village were selected from which adult ticks were collected and immature ticks were also collected by dragging the veld. A questionnaire to assess the prevalence of clinical cases of tick-borne diseases, abscessation and mortalities was completed by an Animal Health Technician at each diptank during dipping. This was done to determine the number of clinical cases of <b>bovine</b> babesiosis, <b>anaplasmosis</b> as well as abscessation. An increase in seroprevalence to B. bovis and B. bigemina and a decrease in seroprevalence to Anaplasma was detected in the strategically dipped group whilst in the intensively dipped group a decrease in seroprevalence to B. bovis and B. bigemina and an increase in seroprevalence to Anaplasma was detected. Amblyomma hebraeum was the most abundant tick species found on the cattle in this region, whilst Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus and Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus were also collected and R.

In the Dakahlia Governorate, Egypt, 164 cattle were investigated {{for the presence of}} piroplasms and Anaplasma species. All investigated cattle were clinically examined. Blood samples were screened for the presence of blood parasites using microscopy and PCR assays. Seventy-one animals were acutely ill, whereas 93 were apparently healthy. In acutely ill cattle, Babesia/Theileria species (n= 11) and Anaplasma marginale (n= 10) were detected. Mixed infections with Babesia/Theileria spp. and A. marginale were present in two further cases. A. marginale infections were also detected in apparently healthy subjects (n= 23). The results of PCR assays were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All samples that were positive by PCR for Babesia/Theileria spp. gave also positive results in the microarray analysis. The microarray chips identified Babesia bovis (n= 12) and Babesia bigemina (n= 2). Cattle with babesiosis were likely to have hemoglobinuria and nervous signs when compared to those with anaplasmosis that frequently had bloody feces. We conclude that clinical examination in combination with microscopy are still very useful in diagnosing acute cases of babesiosis and anaplasmosis, but a combination of molecular biological diagnostic assays will detect even asymptomatic carriers. In perspective, parallel detection of Babesia/Theileria spp. and A. marginale infections using a single microarray system will be a valuable improvement...|$|R
40|$|The cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus, has a {{debilitating}} {{effect on the}} livestock industry worldwide, owing to its being a vector of the causative agents of <b>bovine</b> babesiosis and <b>anaplasmosis.</b> In South Africa, co-infestation with R. microplus and R. decoloratus, a common vector species on local livestock, occurs widely in the northern and eastern parts of the country. An alternative to chemical control methods is sought {{in the form of}} a tick vaccine to control these tick species. However, sequence information and transcriptional data for R. decoloratus is currently lacking. Therefore, this study aimed at identifying genes that are shared between midgut tissues of feeding adult female R. microplus and R. decoloratus ticks. In this regard, a custom oligonucleotide microarray comprising of 13, 477 R. microplus sequences was used for transcriptional profiling and 2476 genes were found to be shared between these Rhipicephalus species. In addition, 136 transcripts were found to be more abundantly expressed in R. decoloratus and 1084 in R. microplus. Chi-square analysis revealed that genes involved in lipid transport and metabolism are significantly overrepresented in R. microplus and R. decoloratus. This study is the first transcriptional profiling of R. decoloratus and is an additional resource that can be evaluated further in future studies for possible tick control.

40|$|Abstract. Carriers of <b>bovine</b> <b>anaplasmosis</b> in Northern Kerala, South India were {{detected}} using conventional microscopical and molecular techniques. PCR-RFLP and nested PCR techniques {{were used for}} detection of Anaplasma marginale and Anaplasma bovis respectively and the PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. Out of 150 samples tested, 25 {{were detected}} positive for A. marginale and five for A. bovis based on molecular tests. The inclusion bodies of A. marginale could be detected by microscopy in two blood smears after staining by giemsa while acridine orange staining detected three smears positive. The data clearly suggest the higher sensitivity of molecular techniques for diagnosis of these diseases...|$|E

40|$|A {{serological}} {{survey of}} <b>bovine</b> babesiosis and <b>anaplasmosis</b> in communal cattle {{was conducted in}} the northwestern province of Tete, Mozambique. Blood was collected from cattle ranging from 4 to 15 months old from randomly selected farms from six districts. Thirty-nine per cent of all 478 calves tested in Tete Province were seropositive to the ELISA for Babesia bovis antibodies and 63 % of all calves were seropositive in the card agglutination test for Anaplasma marginale. Seroprevalence of B. bovis ranged from 22. 8 % in Tete City District to 48. 1 % in Angonia District. For A. marginale, it ranged from 34. 4 % in Angonia District to 87. 3 % in Moatize District. The dominant factor affecting seroprevalence for both haemoparasites was district {{and there was a}} trend for higher intensity of tick control to be associated with a higher seroprevalence of B. bovis and a lower seroprevalence of A. marginale. The obvious differences were the low prevalence of B. bovis in Tete City Council District and the low prevalence of A. marginale in Angonia District. The levels of exposure to B. bovis seen in our study are well below any that could be considered to be consistent with endemic stability, yet they are sufficiently high to ensure that clinical disease would be a risk. The seroprevalence of A. marginale, however, suggests that endemic stability with respect to this disease could exist in districts other than Angonia. There was no strong and consistent relationship between the intensity of control and the likelihood of seropositivity to either of the diseases...|$|R
40|$|Ticks, as vectors {{of disease}} and damage agents, impact {{directly}} and indirectly on {{the economy of the}} livestock industry in southern Africa. This study surveyed the occurrence and distribution of ticks infesting livestock across the North West province, South Africa. During three phases in consecutive years, officers of the provincial Veterinary Department collected specimens monthly from livestock hosts at specified sites across the province. Data analysis constituted the fourth phase of the study. A total of 1090 collections from 265 sites yielded 42 566 tick specimens, comprising 22 different tick species (18 ixodids, 4 argasids). The specimens represent all of the major tick vectors of disease that occur in South Africa. The major tick-borne diseases (i. e. heartwater, both African and Asiatic <b>bovine</b> babesiosis and <b>anaplasmosis)</b> were found to be prevalent mainly in the north-eastern region of the province, which also displayed the highest tick species diversity. The central region appears transitory to some of the major vectors. Although some tick species were contained within specific regions, others were widespread across the province. Associated serology data show that most herds sampled in areas endemic for babesiosis and anaplasmosis in the north-eastern region are endemically unstable and at risk to these tick-borne diseases should vector control measures become ineffective.

40|$|The ticks Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus and R. (B.) microplus, {{commonly}} known as cattle and southern cattle tick, respectively, impede the development and sustainability of livestock industries throughout tropical and other world regions. They affect animal productivity and wellbeing directly through their obligate blood feeding habit and indirectly by serving as vectors of the infectious agents causing <b>bovine</b> babesiosis and <b>anaplasmosis.</b> The monumental scientific discovery of certain arthropod species as vectors of infectious agents {{is associated with the}} history of research on bovine babesiosis and R. annulatus. Together, R. microplus and R. annulatus are referred to as cattle fever ticks (CFT). Bovine babesiosis became a regulated foreign animal disease in the United States of America (U. S.) through efforts of the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CFTEP) established in 1906. The U. S. was declared free of CFT in 1943, {{with the exception of a}} permanent quarantine zone in south Texas along the border with Mexico. This achievement contributed greatly to the development and productivity of animal agriculture in the U. S. The permanent quarantine zone buffers CFT incursions from Mexico where both ticks and babesiosis are endemic. Until recently, the elimination of CFT outbreaks relied solely on the use of coumaphos, an organophosphate acaricide, in dipping vats or as a spray to treat livestock, or the vacation of pastures. However, ecological, societal, and economical changes are shifting the paradigm of systematically treating livestock to eradicate CFT. Keeping the U. S. CFT-free is a critical animal health issue affecting the economic stability of livestock and wildlife enterprises. Here, we describe vulnerabilities associated with global change forces challenging the CFTEP. The concept of integrated CFT eradication is discussed in reference to global change...|$|R
