40|$|Pea nuclear {{extracts}} {{were used}} in gel retardation assays and DNase I footprinting experiments to identify a protein factor that specifically interacts with regulatory DNA sequences upstream of the pea rbcS- 3 A-gene. This factor, designated GT- 1, binds to two short sequences (<b>boxes</b> <b>II</b> and III) in the - 150 region that are known to function as light-responsive elements (LREs) in transgenic tobacco. Binding of GT- 1 to homologous sequences further upstream (<b>boxes</b> <b>II</b> and III in the - 220 region) indicates that these boxes comprise the redundant LRE that functions in vivo when <b>boxes</b> <b>II</b> and III are deleted. In both <b>box</b> <b>II</b> and <b>box</b> <b>II,</b> methylation interference experiments demonstrate that two adjacent G residues are critical for GT-binding. Single Gs present in boxes III and III are also important. Since GT- 1 is present in nuclear extracts from leaves of light-grown and dark-adapted pea plants, its regulatory role {{does not depend on}} de novo synthesis. Thus if GT- 1 binds differentially in vivo it must be postranslationally modified or sterically blocked from binding by another factor in response to light...|$|R

40|$|The Bacillus subtilis gltAB genes, coding {{for the two}} {{subunits}} of glutamate synthase, are transcribed divergently {{from the}} gltC gene, encoding a LysR-type transcriptional activator of gltAB. The predicted gltA and gltC transcription start sites are separated by 51 to 52 bp. A 15 -bp, consensus binding site (Box I) for LysR-type proteins was found centered at position - 64 {{with respect to the}} gltA transcription start. This site was shown by mutational analysis to be required both for GltC-mediated activation of gltA and for autorepression of gltC. <b>Box</b> <b>II,</b> which is similar to Box I, is centered 22 bp downstream of Box I and overlaps the - 35 region of the gltA promoter. <b>Box</b> <b>II</b> was found to be essential for activation of gltA but not for gltC autoregulation. Introduction of approximately one additional helical turn of DNA between Box I and <b>Box</b> <b>II</b> enhanced gltA expression 7 - to 40 -fold under nonactivating conditions and about 2 -fold under activating conditions.

50|$|Before the Second World War, {{there were}} two {{mechanical}} signal boxes in Neu-Ulm of the Bruchsal class, which were called signal <b>boxes</b> <b>II</b> and III. Signal <b>box</b> <b>II</b> was destroyed in World War II in an air raid on 1 March 1945. After the war it was rebuilt and resumed operations in mid-1946.

In 2004, signal box III was decommissioned. As part of Neu-Ulm 21, the push button interlocking was decommissioned on 17 March 2007 and demolished shortly thereafter. As a substitute on 18 March 2007, an electronic interlocking in Ulm, built as Lorenz class L90, remotely controls the Neu-Ulm area.|$|R

Using an in vivo system, we have developed a functional map of the U 3 small nucleolar RNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The test strain features a galactose-dependent U 3 gene in the chromosome and a plasmid-encoded allele with a unique hybridization tag. Effects of mutations on U 3 production were analyzed by evaluating RNA levels in cells grown on galactose medium, and effects on U 3 function were assessed by growing cells on glucose medium. The major findings are as follows: (i) boxes C � and D and flanking helices are critical for U 3 accumulation; (<b>ii)</b> <b>boxes</b> <b>B</b> and C are not essential for U 3 production but are important for function, most likely due to binding of a trans-acting factor(s); (iii) the 5 � portion of U 3 is required for function but not stability; and, (iv) strikingly, the nonconserved hairpins 2, 3, and 4, which account for 50 % of the molecule, are not required for accumulation or function.

40|$|Four short {{nucleotide}} sequences (boxes I to IV) {{contribute to}} the light responsiveness of the parsley chalcone synthase promoter. The sequence-related <b>boxes</b> <b>II</b> and III resemble several plant, viral, and bacterial promoter elements that share ACGT core sequences and are associated with diversely regulated genes. We have analyzed the binding characteristics and protein-protein interactions of factors from nuclear extracts and of three putative leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors potentially involved in the regulation of this promoter. These common plant regulatory factors (CPRFs) bind specifically to <b>boxes</b> <b>II</b> and III {{as well as other}} ACGT-containing promoter elements (hex 1, Em 1 a, and as- 1), though with markedly different affinities. Intact bZIP domains are crucial for CPRF binding to DNA. Distinct ensembles of nuclear factors bind to <b>boxes</b> <b>II</b> and III, despite their sequence similarity.

40|$|The {{sequence}} {{element of}} <b>box</b> <b>II</b> (GTGTGGTTAATATG) is a regulatory {{component of a}} light-responsive element present within the upstream region of pea rbcS- 3 A. The nuclear protein GT- 1 was defined previously as a DNA binding activity that interacts with <b>box</b> <b>II.</b> Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of cDNA sequences that encode a DNA binding protein with specificity for this element. The recombinant protein, tobacco GT- 1 a, shows similar sequence requirements for DNA binding to nuclear GT- 1, as assayed by its ability to interact with previously defined 2 -bp scanning mutations of <b>box</b> <b>II,</b> and is shown to be immunologically related to nuclear GT- 1. The predicted structure of the 43 -kD protein derived from the cDNA sequence suggests {{the presence of a}} novel helix-helix-turn-helix (HHTH) motif. Comparison between the predicted protein sequence encoded by the tobacco GT- 1 a cDNA and that of another GT binding protein, rice GT- 2 reveals strong amino acid conservation over the HHTH region; this motif appears {{to be involved in the}} interaction between the recombinant protein and <b>box</b> <b>II.</b> Genomic DNA gel blot analysis indicated the presence of a small gene family of related sequences within the tobacco nuclear genome.

40|$|The phloem-specific {{promoter}} of rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) is regulated {{in part by}} sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that bind to <b>Box</b> <b>II,</b> an essential cis element. Previous studies demonstrated that the bZIP protein RF 2 a is involved in transcriptional regulation of the RTBV promoter. Here we report the identification and functional characterization of a second bZIP protein, RF 2 b. RF 2 b, identified by its interaction with RF 2 a, binds to <b>Box</b> <b>II</b> in in vitro assays as a homodimer and as RF 2 a/RF 2 b heterodimers. Like RF 2 a, RF 2 b activates the RTBV promoter in transient assays and in transgenic tobacco plants. Both RF 2 a and RF 2 b are predominantly expressed in vascular tissues. However, RF 2 a and RF 2 b have different DNA-binding affinities to <b>Box</b> <b>II,</b> show distinctive expression patterns in different rice organs, and exhibit different patterns of subcellular localization. Furthermore, transgenic rice plants with reduced levels of RF 2 b exhibit a disease-like phenotype. We propose that the regulation of phloem-specific expression of the RTBV promoter and potentially the control of RTBV replication are mainly achieved via interactions of the <b>Box</b> <b>II</b> cis element with multiple host factors, including RF 2 a and RF 2 b. We also propose that quenching/titration of these and perhaps other transcription factors by RTBV {{is involved in the}} development of the symptoms of rice tungro disease...|$|R

The integron integrase belongs to the tyrosine recombinase (phage integrase) family. The members of this family, exemplified by the lambda integrase, do not share extensive amino acid identities, but three invariant residues are found within two regions, designated box I and <b>box</b> <b>II.</b> Two conserved residues are arginines, one located in box I and one in <b>box</b> <b>II,</b> while the other conserved residue is a tyrosine located at the C terminus of <b>box</b> <b>II.</b> We have analyzed the properties of IntI 1 variants carrying point mutations at the three conserved residues {{of the family in}} in vivo recombination and in vitro substrate binding.
