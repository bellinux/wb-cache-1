25|$|Enzymatic {{methylation}} {{of arsenic}} is a detoxification process; {{it can be}} mehylated to methylarsenite, dimethylarsenite or trimethylarsenite, {{all of which are}} trivalent. The methylation is catalyzed by arsenic methyltransferase (AS3MT) in mammals, which transfers a methyl group on the cofactor S-adenomethionine (SAM) to arsenic (III). An orthologue of AS3MT is found in bacteria and is called CmArsM. This enzyme was tested in three states (ligand free, arsenic (III) bound and SAM bound). Arsenic (III) binding sites usually use thiol groups of cyseine residues. The catalysis involves thiolates of Cys72, Cys174, and Cys224. In an SN2 reaction, the positive charge on the SAM sulfur atom pulls the <b>bonding</b> <b>electron</b> from the carbon of the methyl group, which interacts with the arsenic lone pair to form an As−C bond, leaving SAH.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the high}} vacuum {{pressure}} in the ionization chamber, the mean free path of molecules are varying from 10 cm to 1 km and then the fragmentations are unimolecular processes. Once the fragmentation is initiated, the electron is first excited from the site with the lowest ionization energy. Since {{the order of the}} electron energy is non-bonding <b>electrons</b> > pi <b>bond</b> <b>electrons</b> > sigma <b>bond</b> <b>electrons,</b> the order of ionization preference is non-bonding <b>electrons</b> > pi <b>bond</b> <b>electrons</b> > sigma <b>bond</b> <b>electrons.</b>|$|R

50|$|The valence of a bond, S, {{is defined}} as the number of {{electron}} pairs forming the bond. In general this is not an integral number. Since each of the terminal atoms contributes equal numbers of electrons to the bond, the bond valence is also equal to the number of valence electrons that each atom contributes. Further, since within each atom, the negatively charged valence shell is linked to the positively charged core by an electrostatic flux that is equal to the charge on the valence shell, it follows that the bond valence is also equal to the electrostatic flux that links the core to the electrons forming the bond. The bond valence is thus equal to three different quantities: the number of electrons each atom contributes to the bond, the number of electron pairs that form the bond, and the electrostatic flux linking each core to the <b>bonding</b> <b>electron</b> pair.|$|E
5000|$|Combustion in oxygen is a chain {{reaction}} in which many distinct radical intermediates participate. The high energy required for initiation is explained by the unusual structure of the dioxygen molecule. The lowest-energy configuration of the dioxygen molecule is a stable, relatively unreactive diradical in a triplet spin state. Bonding can be described with three <b>bonding</b> <b>electron</b> pairs and two antibonding electrons, whose spins are aligned, such that the molecule has nonzero total angular momentum. Most fuels, on the other hand, are in a singlet state, with paired spins and zero total angular momentum. Interaction {{between the two is}} quantum mechanically a [...] "forbidden transition", i.e. possible with a very low probability. To initiate combustion, energy is required to force dioxygen into a spin-paired state, or singlet oxygen. This intermediate is extremely reactive. The energy is supplied as heat, and the reaction then produces additional heat, which allows it to continue.|$|E

50|$|The {{dispersion}} of the refractive index {{is a fundamental}} property of matter. It may {{be thought of as}} the result of the relative proximity of the harmonic frequencies of the outer shell electrons in a compound to the frequencies of visible light. The harmonic frequency of the <b>bonding</b> <b>electron</b> is the result of the energy of that bond. If the bond is very strong the frequency will be very high. The higher the frequency the less effect the difference in frequencies from blue to red will have on the refractive index. For the relatively high energy bonds in most inorganic solids this means their refractive indices change very little over the visible range of frequencies. The refractive indices of organic compounds on the other hand, with their lower bonding energies, change significantly over the visible range. This difference in dispersion is the basis of the Christiansen effect and the dispersion staining methods.|$|E

Many oxoanions of {{elements in}} lower oxidation state obey the octet rule and this can be used to rationalize the formulae adopted.

5000|$|Simple Molecular Orbital (MO) {{diagram of}} In {{contrast}} to localizing electrons within their atomic orbitals in valence bond theory, the molecular orbital approach considers electrons to be delocalized {{across the entire}} molecule. The simple MO diagram of [...] is shown on the right. Following simple symmetry treatments, the 1s orbitals of hydrogen atom are premixed as a1 and b1. Orbitals of same symmetry and similar energy levels can then be mixed {{to form a new}} set of molecular orbitals with bonding, nonbonding, and antibonding characteristics. In the simple MO diagram of , the 2s orbital of oxygen is mixed with the premixed hydrogen orbitals, forming a new bonding (2a1) and antibonding orbital (4a1). Similarly, the 2p orbital (b1) and the other premixed hydrogen 1s orbitals (b1) are mixed to make bonding orbital 1b1 and antibonding orbital 2b1. The two remaining 2p orbitals are unmixed. While this simple MO diagram does not provide four different energy levels as experimentally determined from PES, the two bonding orbitals are nonetheless distinctly different thus providing differentiation on the <b>bonding</b> <b>electron</b> energy levels.|$|E
50|$|In a {{simplified}} {{view of an}} ionic bond, the <b>bonding</b> <b>electron</b> is not shared at all, but transferred. In this type of bond, the outer atomic orbital of one atom has a vacancy which allows the addition {{of one or more}} electrons. These newly added electrons potentially occupy a lower energy-state (effectively closer to more nuclear charge) than they experience in a different atom. Thus, one nucleus offers a more tightly bound position to an electron than does another nucleus, with the result that one atom may transfer an electron to the other. This transfer causes one atom to assume a net positive charge, and the other to assume a net negative charge. The bond then results from electrostatic attraction between atoms and the atoms become positive or negatively charged ions. Ionic bonds may be seen as extreme examples of polarization in covalent bonds. Often, such bonds have no particular orientation in space, since they result from equal electrostatic attraction of each ion to all ions around them. Ionic bonds are strong (and thus ionic substances require high temperatures to melt) but also brittle, since the forces between ions are short-range and do not easily bridge cracks and fractures. This type of bond gives rise to the physical characteristics of crystals of classic mineral salts, such as table salt.|$|E
50|$|The overall {{geometry}} {{is further}} refined by distinguishing between bonding and nonbonding electron pairs. The <b>bonding</b> <b>electron</b> pair shared in a sigma bond with an adjacent atom lies {{further from the}} central atom than a nonbonding (lone) pair of that atom, which is held close to its positively charged nucleus. VSEPR theory therefore views repulsion by the lone pair to be greater than the repulsion by a bonding pair. As such, when a molecule has 2 interactions with different degrees of repulsion, VSEPR theory predicts the structure where lone pairs occupy positions {{that allow them to}} experience less repulsion. Lone pair-lone pair (lp-lp) repulsions are considered stronger than lone pair-bonding pair (lp-bp) repulsions, which in turn are considered stronger than bonding pair-bonding pair (bp-bp) repulsions, distinctions that then guide decisions about overall geometry when 2 or more non-equivalent positions are possible. For instance, when 5 valence electron pairs surround a central atom, they adopt a trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry with two collinear axial positions and three equatorial positions. An electron pair in an axial position has three close equatorial neighbors only 90° away and a fourth much farther at 180°, while an equatorial electron pair has only two adjacent pairs at 90° and two at 120°. The repulsion from the close neighbors at 90° is more important, so that the axial positions experience more repulsion than the equatorial positions; hence, when there are lone pairs, they tend to occupy equatorial positions as shown in the diagrams of the next section for steric number five.|$|E
