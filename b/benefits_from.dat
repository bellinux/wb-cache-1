5|$|The hydroid Hydractinia angusta has a mutualistic {{relationship}} with the scallop. A study showed that its larvae preferentially settled {{in the vicinity of}} other epibionts, usually on scallop shells, and that the scallop larvae were deterred from settling in the vicinity of colonies of the hydroid. It is surmised that the hydroid <b>benefits</b> <b>from</b> a solid substrate on which to live, and although the scallop <b>benefits</b> <b>from</b> the protection from predators provided by the stinging cells of the hydroid, it is disadvantaged by the failure of its larvae to establish themselves in their preferred location, on the shells of mature scallops.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry is {{opposite}} {{in principle}} to defensive mimicry, where the mimic generally <b>benefits</b> <b>from</b> being treated as harmful. The mimic may resemble its own prey, or some other organism which is beneficial {{or at least not}} harmful to the prey. The model, i.e. the organism being 'imitated', may experience increased or reduced fitness, or may not be affected at all by the relationship. On the other hand, the signal receiver inevitably suffers from being tricked, {{as is the case in}} most mimicry complexes.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{experimental}} {{support for this}} hypothesis, it remains controversial. A common critique is that devoutness is easy to fake, such as simply by attending a religious service. However, the hypothesis predicts that {{people are more likely}} to join and contribute to a religious group when its rituals are costly. Another critique specifically asks: why religion? There is no evolutionary advantage to evolving religion over other signals of commitment such as nationality, as Irons admits. However, the reinforcement of religious rites as well as the intrinsic reward and punishment system found in religion makes it an ideal candidate for increasing intragroup cooperation. Finally, there is insufficient evidence for increase in fitness as a result of religious cooperation. However, Sosis argues for <b>benefits</b> <b>from</b> religion itself, such as increased longevity, improved health, assistance during crises, and greater psychological well being though both the supposed <b>benefits</b> <b>from</b> religion and the costly-signaling mechanism have been contested.|$|E
5|$|Found in open woods, parks, hedges and {{cultivated}} land, the mistle thrush feeds {{on a wide}} variety of invertebrates, seeds and berries. Its preferred fruits including those of the mistletoe, holly and yew. Mistletoe is favoured where it is available, and this is reflected in the thrush's English and scientific names; the plant, a parasitic species, <b>benefits</b> <b>from</b> its seeds being excreted by the thrush onto branches where they can germinate. In winter, a mistle thrush will vigorously defend mistletoe clumps or a holly tree as a food reserve for when times are hard.|$|E

It is estimated that with this wide-scale implementation, the city of Los Angeles can annually save $100M with most of the savings coming from cool roofs, lighter colored pavement, and the planting of trees. With a citywide implementation, added <b>benefits</b> <b>from</b> the lowering smog-level would result in at least one billion dollars of saving per year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1983, Virginia Tech was placed on {{probation}} by the NCAA for violations stemming from illegal benefits given to players and potential recruits.
