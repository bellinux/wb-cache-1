5|$|The Phantom FG.1 and FGR.2 {{as built}} were similar, being fitted with broadly the same engines and avionics, {{although}} there were minor differences. The FGR.2 was fitted with the Mark 202 version of the Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan, while the FG.1 had the Mark 203; this was fundamentally the same, but the 203 had a modified control system for the afterburner, allowing it to light faster and enable power to be applied quickly {{in the event of}} a <b>bolter</b> on the small decks of the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers. Both variants were fitted with a licence built version of the Westinghouse AN/AWG-10 avionics package; the FG.1 was fitted with the AN/AWG-11, which differed primarily in having a nose radome that was hinged and able to fold backwards against the aircraft's fuselage to allow for storage in the hangar of an aircraft carrier; the system was designed to be integrated with both the AGM-12 Bullpup missile and WE.177 as required. The AN/AWG-12 fitted to the FGR.2 was not foldable, and featured a better ground mapping mode, to take into account the strike role for which the type was originally procured; allied to this was a Ferranti inertial navigation/attack system (removed when the type converted to the air defence role). It was also configured to be able to control the SUU-23A gun pod, which the Royal Navy's FG.1s lacked.|$|E

25|$|Aggressive: The {{new medium}} {{attempts}} to “absorb the older medium entirely, {{so that the}} discontinuities between the two are minimized” (p.47). <b>Bolter</b> and Grusin speak to the computer games Myst and Doom, which remediate cinema so that “players become characters in a cinematic narrative” (p.47). Video games allow for an (limited) ability to determine narrative within a subjective realization through the capacity to “decide where to look—where to direct their graphically realized points of view” (p.47). In regard to film, <b>Bolter</b> and Grusin, in part, understand this form of aggressive remediation as “an attempt to hold off the threat that digital media might pose for the traditional, linear film” (p.48). This form of aggressive remediation seeks a different form of transparency, through attempting making any electronic interventions invisible. This concealment of its relationship to earlier media, “promises the user an unmediated experience” (p.48).|$|E
25|$|On {{the cutting}} edge of what many are calling the new media {{revolution}} of form and content, or in other words of the mediation of experience, <b>Bolter</b> and Grusin provide an important insight into the interdependency of media and its integral role in understanding how “the remediation of reality has been built into our technologies of representation” (p.62).|$|E

25|$|Theorists of {{new media}} examine how {{emerging}} kinds of media, such as websites, blogs, wiki pages, and digital video, both delimit the ways people can use them, and provide new avenues {{for the production}} of social relations and meanings. Picking up from McLuhan, media theorists Jay David <b>Bolter</b> and Richard Grusin , in their 1999 book Remediation: Understanding New Media, sought to describe how media forms interact with one another through remediation and the way that this media practice invokes the interrelated processes of immediacy and hypermediacy. The validation of the concept of ‘remediation’; “the representation of one medium in another” (p.45), is a principal aim of the book, in order to illustrate how remediation has been an integral practice to both new and old media forms that continually inform one another. Immediacy attempts to make viewers feel as if ‘really’ there, through hypermediated practices, which splice together (hybridizing as McLuhan would say) different kinds of media, such as the combination of “live-action footage with computer compositing and two- and three-dimensional computer graphics” (p.6) in order to create the appearance of a seamless moving image. These interrealated processes highlight, what <b>Bolter</b> and Grusin term, the “double logic of remediation” (p.5) that pursues the proliferation of media whilst trying to erase all traces of human and/or technological mediation.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Bolter</b> and Grusin {{contend that}} the process of {{remediation}} emphasizes that all media is, on one level, a poststructutalist ‘play of signs’ (p.19). The recognition of these varying signs of influence differ across a spectrum, from ‘transparent’ remediations that clearly represent the previous media form, to aggressive forms that seek to disguise the role of their hypermediated practices in the name of providing the highest sense of immediacy. <b>Bolter</b> and Grusin broadly identify forms of remediation, across a spectrum, in the following five categorisations: ...|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, <b>Bolter</b> and Grusin also {{discuss a}} {{psychological}} dimension of “the desire for immediacy and the fascination with hypermediacy” (p.62) that considers how individuals are subjugated through their engagement with media forms. For instance, “when we watch a film or a television broadcast, we understand ourselves as the changing {{point of view}} of the camera” (p.62). <b>Bolter</b> and Grusin stipulate that the media type predisposes the form of subjectivisation that takes places and that all mediated participations offer, “a different mediation of the subject, and our experience is the remediation of these differences” (p.62). A subject’s existence is understood as “the ability to occupy points of view … [...] can enter into immediate relationships with the various media or media forms that surround her” (p.63). Considerations of the ways the ‘self’ is involved in processes of mediation and remediation enable an examination of the effect of the desire for immediacy within media. <b>Bolter</b> and Grusin assert that, “instead of trying to be in the presence of the objects of representation, the subject now defines immediacy as being in the presence of media” (p.62).|$|E

2500|$|This {{means that}} all media, from {{literature}} to new digital media, is unable to make a radical break away from what has come before. Media continues to “function in a constant dialectic with earlier media” (p.50) forms, where both old and new are able to impact on one another regardless of which came first. For example, “users of older media such as film and television can seek to appropriate and refashion digital graphics, just as digital graphics artists can refashion film and television” (p.48). However these appropriations within digital technologies of immediacy have often sought to deny mediation. <b>Bolter</b> and Grusin elaborate on the double logic of this form of remediation as an integral function of contemporary immediacy in media. Although <b>Bolter</b> and Grusin acknowledge that not “all of our culture's claims of remediation are equally compelling or that we could necessarily identify all of the strategies through which digital media remediate and are remediated by their predecessors” (p.55) they outline various ways in which “the double logic of remediation can function explicitly or implicitly” (p.55) can be restated in the following ways: ...|$|E
2500|$|... 2) Re{{mediation}} as the inseparability {{of mediation}} and reality: <b>Bolter</b> and Grusin assert that, “although Baudrillard's notion of simulation and simulacra might suggest otherwise, all mediations are themselves real. They are real as artifacts (but not as autonomous agents) in our mediated culture. Despite {{the fact that}} all media depend on other media in cycles of remediation, our culture still needs to acknowledge that all media remediate the real.

2500|$|Continuous mining {{utilizes}} a Continuous Miner Machine {{with a large}} rotating {{steel drum}} equipped with tungsten carbide picks that scrape coal from the seam. Operating in a “room and pillar” (also known as “bord and pillar”) systemwhere the mine is divided {{into a series of}} 20-to-30-foot (5–10 m) “rooms” or work areas cut into the coalbedit can mine as much as 14 tons of coal a minute, more than a non-mechanised mine of the 1920s would produce in an entire day. Continuous miners account for about 45 percent of underground coal production. Conveyors transport the removed coal from the seam. Remote-controlled continuous miners are used to work in a variety of difficult seams and conditions, and robotic versions controlled by computers are becoming increasingly common. Continuous mining is a misnomer, as room and pillar coal mining is very cyclical. In the US, one can generally cut [...] (or a bit more with MSHA permission) (12 meters or roughly 40ft in South Africa before the Continuous Miner goes out and the roof is supported by the Roof <b>Bolter),</b> after which, the face has to be serviced, before it can be advanced again.

However, very few mines are able to achieve it. Most continuous mining machines in use in the US lack the ability to bolt and dust. This may partly be because incorporation of bolting makes the machines wider, and therefore, less maneuverable.|$|E
