5|$|The {{idea that}} would spawn Microsoft {{initiated}} when Paul Allen showed <b>Bill</b> <b>Gates</b> {{the first of}} January, 1975 issue of Popular Electronics that demonstrated the Altair 8800. Allen and Gates saw potential to develop an implementation of the programming language BASIC interpreter for the system. <b>Bill</b> <b>Gates</b> called the creators of the new microcomputer, Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), offering to demonstrate the implementation {{in order to win}} a contract with the company. Allen and Gates had neither an interpreter nor an Altair system, yet in the eight weeks before the demo, they developed an interpreter. When Allen flew to Albuquerque to meet with MITS, the interpreter worked and MITS agreed to distribute Altair BASIC. Allen and Gates left Boston, where Allen worked for Honeywell and Gates was enrolled in Harvard, moved to Albuquerque (where MITS was located), and co-founded Microsoft there. Revenues of the company totaled $16,005 by the end of 1976.|$|E

5|$|In December 1974 <b>Bill</b> <b>Gates</b> was {{a student}} at Harvard University and Paul Allen worked for Honeywell in Boston. They saw the Altair 8800 {{computer}} in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics and knew it was powerful enough to support a BASIC interpreter. They wanted {{to be the first to}} offer BASIC for the Altair computer, and the software development tools they had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor based Traf-O-Data computer would give them a head start. While their friend, Paul Gilbert, was building the computer, Allen wrote a program that ran on a DEC PDP-10 time-sharing computer that simulated the 8008 system. He also modified DEC's macro assembler to produce the machine code for the 8008 microprocessor. The Traf-O-Data software could be written and debugged before the computer hardware was complete.|$|E
