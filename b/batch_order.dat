40|$|Order picking is a {{warehouse}} function {{dealing with the}} retrieval of articles from their storage location {{in order to satisfy}} a given demand specified by customer orders. Of all warehouse operations, order picking is considered to include the most cost-intensive ones. Even though there have been different attempts to automate the picking process, manual order picking systems are still prevalent in practice. This article will focus on <b>order</b> <b>batching,</b> one of the main planning issues in order picking systems. <b>Order</b> <b>Batching</b> has been proven to be pivotal for the efficiency of order picking operations. With respect to the availability of information about the customer <b>orders,</b> <b>order</b> <b>batching</b> can be distinguished into static batching and dynamic <b>batching.</b> Improved <b>order</b> <b>batching</b> reduces the total picking time required to collect the requested articles. According to experience from practice, this can result in significant savings of labor cost and into a reduction of the customer order's delivery lead time. The aim of this contribution is to provide comprehensive insights into <b>order</b> <b>batching</b> by giving a detailed state-of-the-art overview of the different solution approaches which have been suggested in the literature. Corresponding to the available publications, the emphasis will be on static <b>order</b> <b>batching.</b> In addition to this, the paper will also review the existing literature for variants and extensions of static <b>order</b> <b>batching</b> (e. g. due dates, alternative objective functions).

40|$|Research on {{warehousing}} {{systems has}} gained interest since the 1980 s, reflecting {{the fact that}} supply chain management has pursued a demand-driven organization with high product variety, small order sizes, and reliable short response times throughout the supply chain. This market trend has affected warehouse management and operations tremendously. <b>Order</b> <b>batching</b> in a warehouse attempts to achieve high-volume order processing operations by consolidating small <b>orders</b> into <b>batches.</b> <b>Order</b> <b>batching</b> is an essential operation of order processing in which several orders are grouped into batches. This paper describes {{the development of an}} <b>order</b> <b>batching</b> approach based on data mining and integer programming.

40|$|The bullwhip effect, or demand {{information}} distortion, {{has been}} a subject of both theoretical and empirical studies in the operations management literature. Empirical studies have shown large magnitudes of the bullwhip effect at the individual product level, but the effect does not always exist at the macro level. The majority of studies focusing on the macro level have used monthly data due to its availability. In practice, however, companies often order more frequently than monthly, such as at daily or weekly intervals. In this paper, we examine how data aggregation can affect the observation of bullwhip effect. Specifically, we show how aggregating data over relatively long time periods can mask {{the magnitude of the}} bullwhip effect. In addition, we show that similar impacts occur when data is aggregated across products, and how the existence of correlated demand, seasonality, <b>batch</b> <b>order,</b> and finite capacity all can affect the measurement of the bullwhip effect. Finally, we discuss the cost implications associated with the measured magnitude of the bullwhip effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{manufacture}} of copper alloy flat rolled metals involves {{hot and cold}} rolling operations, together with annealing and other secondary processes, to transform castings (mainly slabs and cakes) into such shapes as strip, plate, sheet, etc. Production is mainly to customer orders {{in a wide range}} of specifications for dimensions and properties. However, order quantities are often small and so process planning plays an important role in this industry. Much research work has been done in the past in relation to the technology of flat rolling and the details of the operations, however, there is little or no evidence of any research in the planning of processes for this type of manufacture. Practical observation in a number of rolling mills has established the type of manual process planning traditionally used in this industry. This manual approach, however, has inherent drawbacks, being particularly dependent on the individual planners who gain their knowledge over a long span of practical experience. The introduction of the retrieval CAPP approach to this industry was a first step to reduce these problems. But this could not provide a long-term answer because of the need for an experienced planner to supervise generation of any plan. It also fails to take account of the dynamic nature of the parameters involved in the planning, such as the availability of resources, operation conditions and variations in the costs. The other alternative is the use of a generative approach to planning in the rolling mill context. In this thesis, generative methods are developed for the selection of optimal routes for single orders and then for batches of orders, bearing in mind equipment restrictions, production costs and material yield. The <b>batch</b> <b>order</b> process planning involves the use of a special cluster analysis algorithm for optimal grouping of the orders. This research concentrates on cold-rolling operations. A prototype model of the proposed CAPP system, including both single order and <b>batch</b> <b>order</b> planning options, has been developed and tested on real order data in the industry. The results were satisfactory and compared very favourably with the existing manual and retrieval methods...|$|E
40|$|This paper studies a two-echelon {{supply chain}} with {{stochastic}} and discrete consumer demand, <b>batch</b> <b>order</b> quantities, periodic inventory review, and deterministic transportation times. Reorder point policies manage inventories at every location. Average inventory, backorders and fill rates are evaluated exactly for each location. Safety stock is evaluated exactly {{at the lower}} echelon and a good approximation is detailed for the upper echelon. Numerical data are presented to demonstrate the model’s utility. It is found that system costs generally increase substantially if the upper echelon is restricted to carry no inventory, of if the upper echelon is required to provide a high fill rate. In many cases it is optimal to set the upper echelon’s reorder point to yield near zero safety stock, yet in some cases this simple heuristic can significantly increase supply chain operating costs. Finally, policies selected under the assumption of continuous inventory review can perform poorly if implemented in an environment with periodic review. This paper studies a distribution system with one central warehouse and N identical retailers. Inventory is reviewed periodically and transportation times are deterministic. Firms implement reorder point policies and order quantities equal integer multiples of a fixed batch size.

40|$|In manual {{order picking}} systems, order pickers walk or ride through a {{distribution}} warehouse {{in order to}} collect items required by (internal or external) customers. <b>Order</b> <b>batching</b> consists of combining these – indivisible – customer orders into picking orders. With respect to <b>order</b> <b>batching,</b> two problem types can be distinguished: In off-line (static) <b>batching</b> all customer <b>orders</b> are known in advance. In on-line (dynamic) <b>batching</b> customer <b>orders</b> become available dynamically over time.

A competitive analysis shows that every on-line algorithm for this problem is at least 2 -competitive. Moreover, this bound is tight if an optimal batching algorithm is used.

It is demonstrated that the choice of an appropriate batching method can lead to a substantial reduction of the completion time of a set of customer orders.

40|$|In this study, {{we tested}} a new {{approach}} to facilitate the application of white rot fungi (WRF) under non-sterile conditions, by introducing grain sorghum as carrier and sole carbon and nutrient source for WRF. To this end, Trametes versicolor was immobilized on sorghum, and its ability to remove humic acid (HA) from synthetic and real industrial wastewater was studied. HA removal was measured as colour reduction and also analysed via size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Under sterile conditions, 80 % colour removal was achieved for both synthetic and real wastewater using immobilized WRF on sorghum, without adding any additional carbon or nutrient sources. Under non-sterile conditions, immobilized fungi could again remove 80 % of the colour and reached a maximum of 40 U/L laccase activity. In contrast, non-immobilized fungi cultivated in non-sterile wastewater supplemented with additional nutrients, reached only 10 % decolourization and maximum 5 U/L laccase activity. SEC analysis showed that bioremoval of HA by WRF was associated with degradation of HA. Finally, immobilized fungi were used to treat real wastewater, under non-sterile conditions, in a sequential <b>batch</b> <b>order</b> without renewing the immobilized fungi.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of textile wastewater for reuse using an electrochemical oxidation step {{combined with a}} membrane filtration step is reported in this paper. The electrolytical process is a traditional one, which is easy to scale up and to apply in practice. This paper proposes a modification of the transfer-flow membrane (TFM) module with fibres welded in an arc-shape to enhance the mechanical properties of the fibres and to increase the specific membrane surface of TFM modules. The goal {{of this research was}} to study the performance of the arc-shaped TFM module to demonstrate these sequences of electrochemical oxidation coupled with membrane filtration processes and to develop a potential dyehouse wastewater treatment system for reuse. Two testing sequences of electrochemical oxidation and membrane filtration were studied in a sequential <b>batch</b> <b>order.</b> The results show clearly that fibres welded in an arc-shape can enhance the mechanical properties of the fibres effectively and that electrochemical oxidation and membrane filtration as sequential processes are feasible. Electrochemical oxidation has a high removal (89. 8 % efficiency) of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the wastewater while the membrane filter can almost totally remove the total suspended solids (TSS) (nearly 100 % reduction) and turbidity (98. 3 % elimination) in it. Coincidentally, their advantages make up for their disadvantages. After these two steps, all the wastewater indices decrease to low levels; in particular, COD levels are reduced to 18. 2 mg·l- 1. The treated water can be reused in many production areas of the textile dyehouse factory. To take best advantage of this disposal system, the tw...|$|E
40|$|Trade-offs {{in energy}} {{allocation}} between growth and reproduction {{can result in}} variations in reproductive potential in fish with differing growth patterns. Spawning biomass is often used {{as a proxy for}} reproductive potential on the assumption that fecundity is directly proportional to body weight. We examined variations in the reproductive potential of Atka mackerel Pleurogrammus monopterygius by studying the effect of differential growth and condition patterns on fecundity, atresia, and egg energy. Fecundity and egg energy were determined for fish from two geographic areas, Seguam Pass and Amchitka Island, Alaska, and compared with those of fish held in captivity. These Atka mackerel showed distinct differences in growth and condition, with weight at length and length at age being the highest among captive fish, intermediate among fish from Seguam Pass, and lowest among fish from Amchitka Island. Realized fecundity showed that on average captive fish spawned seven batches, fish from Seguam Pass six batches, and fish from Amchitka Island five batches. For wild fish, potential and realized fecundity at length or age was significantly higher at Seguam Pass than at Amchitka Island, whereas the fecundity-at-weight relationship did not differ by area, suggesting that weight is a better predictor of fecundity than length or age. Atresia and batch fecundity by length or weight did not differ by area, suggesting that the variation in fecundity is better explained by the variation in batch number than by batch size. Oocyte dry weight was higher for captive fish than for wild fish, whereas <b>batch</b> <b>order</b> did not significantly affect oocyte dry weight. Increased potential fecundity, realized fecundity, and oocyte quality in Atka mackerel females were strongly related to body size, indicating that growth differences and maternal feeding success impact the fecundity and oocyte quality of Atka mackerel. Therefore, changes in growth and condition patterns need {{to be taken into account}} to accurately estimate the reproductive potential of this species...|$|E
