Silicon nitride balls weigh 79% less than tungsten carbide balls. Silicon nitride ball bearings {{can be found in}} high end automotive bearings, industrial bearings, wind turbines, motorsports, bicycles, rollerblades and skateboards. Silicon nitride bearings are especially useful in applications where corrosion, electric or magnetic fields prohibit the use of metals.

40|$|Warpage is {{a problem}} that {{frequently}} occurs in laser transformation hardening of precision parts. If, for example, the ball <b>bearing</b> <b>tracks</b> of a linear guiding rail are sequentially hardened with a single laser, this results in bending distortion and torsion of the rail.

A process controlling modular diode laser system is set up and used for hardening of the four ball <b>bearing</b> <b>tracks</b> of a precision linear guiding rail simultaneously. The diode laser system consists of up to ten modules. Each module is equipped with a pyrometer for temperature measurement and feed back control in each processing zone. By multiple beam technique the torsion of the guiding rail can be completely avoided. The resulting bending distortion can be minimized in a second step by a straightening treatment, using the same modular diode laser system...|$|R

30|$|For the {{definitive}} {{treatment of a}} dislocated bearing, the underlying cause of the primary or secondary dislocation needs to be addressed. Damage to the extraarticular surface of the bearing suggests impingement. Impingement should be rectified by removing excess bone or cement. Slight imbalance of the knee can be accepted. If the bearing has been dislocated for some time, there may be damage to the metal surfaces of the components. This damage tends to be local flattening of the femoral surface or a local concavity in the tibial surface. Since the damaged area is smooth it can be ignored. Following a trial reduction to ensure the <b>bearing</b> <b>tracks</b> satisfactorily, a new anatomic bearing of correct size should be inserted.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{particle}} filter acoustic direction-of-arrival (DOA) tracker to track multiple maneuvering targets using a state space approach. The particle filter determines its state vector using {{a batch of}} DOA estimates. The filter likeli-hood treats the observations as an image, using template models derived from the state update equation, and also incorporates the possibility of missing data as well as spurious DOA observations. Multiple targets are handled using a partitioned state-vector approach. The particle filter solution is compared with three other methods: the extended Kalman filter, Laplacian filter, and another particle filter that uses the acoustic microphone outputs directly. In addition, we demonstrate an autonomous system for multiple target DOA tracking with automatic target initialization and deletion. The initialization system uses a track-before-detect approach and employs matching pursuit to initialize multiple targets. Computer simulations are presented to compare {{the performance of the}} algorithms.

40|$|A {{multinational}} oceanographic and acoustic sea {{experiment was}} carried out in the summer of 2014 off the western coast of the island of Sardinia, Mediterranean Sea. During this experiment, an underwater glider fitted with two hydrophones was evaluated as a potential tool for marine mammal population density estimation studies. An acoustic recording system was also tested, comprising an inexpensive, off-the-shelf digital recorder installed inside the glider. Detection and classification of sounds produced by whales and dolphins, and sometimes tracking and localization, are inherent components of population density estimation from passive acoustics recordings. In this work we discuss the equipment used as well as analysis of the data obtained, including detection and estimation of bearing angles. A human analyst identified the presence of sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) regular clicks as well as dolphin clicks and whistles. Cross-correlating clicks recorded on both data channels allowed for the estimation of the direction (bearing) of clicks, and realization of animal tracks.

5000|$|This {{model was}} {{recognised}} {{to have become}} inaccurate for modern bearings. Particularly owing to improvements {{in the quality of}} bearing steels, the mechanisms for how failures develop in the 1924 model are no longer as significant. By the 1990s, real bearings were found to give service lives up to 14 times longer than those predicted. An explanation was put forward based on fatigue life; if the bearing was loaded to never exceed the fatigue strength, then the Lundberg-Palmgren mechanism for failure by fatigue would simply never occur. This relied on homogeneous vacuum-melted steels, such as AISI 52100, that avoided the internal inclusions that had previously acted as stress risers within the rolling elements, and also on smoother finishes to <b>bearing</b> <b>tracks</b> that avoided impact loads. The [...] constant now had values of 4 for ball and 5 for roller bearings. Provided that load limits were observed, the idea of a 'fatigue limit' entered bearing lifetime calculations: if the bearing was not loaded beyond this limit, its theoretical lifetime would be limited only by external factors, such as contamination or a failure of lubrication.|$|R

40|$|Lubrication oil-flow in {{the crank}} system of an medium size diesel engine running at 750 RPM was modeled and analyzed. The model was built up by {{combining}} models from several studies in both engine lubrication systems and pipe flow modal analysis. The model is first {{used to analyze}} a system where the oil supply lines are fully open during the complete engine cycle. The result showed that these designs need a very high oil supply pressure to maintain a positive pressure in the connecting rod at all times. Having a positive pressure is important to prevent cavitation in the oil channels, and to ensure a continuous flow of cooling oil. Secondly the model was used to analyze a system where the big-end <b>bearing</b> <b>tracks</b> runs only half way around the circumference, closing the flow when the piston is in the BDC region. Such a design allowed for a lower oil supply pressure, as the channel closes when the oil is forced back. However pressure transients were amplified by the opening and closing procedure.

40|$|The "classic" {{solution}} {{for the support of}} a translating lockgate, the wheelonrail support, has relatively high construction as well as inspection and maintenance costs. An alternative support which has previously been developed for use in the Prins WillemAlexander lock is the socalled "hydrosupport", a hydrostatic thrust bearing that slides on an elastic track and is connected to the lockgate by an elastic support. After a runningin period, this support shows low friction. In this thesis several methods to further improve this type of support have been studied. The direction of these improvements has been guided by the following observation: The typical dimensions and manufacturing standards of the <b>bearing</b> and the <b>track</b> are in conflict. On the large scale of a lockgate, a hydrostatic bearing typically requires sliding surfaces with a surface waviness smaller than 0. 1 mm/m. However, the track can not be manufactured easily with a surface waviness smaller than typically 0. 5 mm/m. This means that contact between the <b>bearing</b> and <b>track</b> will be inevitable. In this thesis, methods have been studied to use this contact in order to improve the performance (namely reduced flow rate and pumping power) of the hydrosupport. A mathematical model has been developed, incorporating the elastic deformation of the <b>track,</b> <b>bearing</b> and support, and the partial contact and hydrostatic lubricating film between the <b>bearing</b> and <b>track.</b> Several track waviness models have been developed, among others a random periodic surface waviness. Furthermore the concept of an "ideal" support has been introduced, which under compression exhibits a reaction pressure equal to the hydrostatic pressure in a lubricating film with a constant height. Not only has this mathematical model been developed in this thesis, it has also been implemented in a numerical program and used to test the influence of a number of design parameters on the performance of a hydrosupport. It has been shown that, using the contact between the sliding surfaces, the tilting stiffness of a bearing with 1 small recess is comparable to that of the 4 -recess bearing. Additionally, a 1 recess bearing requires a smaller or even no restrictor and therefore a smaller supply pump. Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} the hydrofender with its large length/width ratio has comparable or even better performance than the circular hydrofoot, while requiring a narrower track. In addition, it has been shown that, for a given load, a hydrofender with a small bearing thickness and with a standard elastic support design exhibits a smaller flow rate and larger bearing coefficient than a bearing with an ideal support design. Finally, using the results of these parametric studies, a procedure has been developed for the design of hydrosupports. This procedure has been used in two examples.
