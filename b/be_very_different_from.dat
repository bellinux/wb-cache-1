Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{show that}} the culture on {{military}} bases is perceived by most current and former military brats as significantly different from civilian culture. It is widely experienced as being pervaded by military cultural norms and expectations, {{as well as the}} presence of military police or their other military security forces equivalents, armed guards, high security zones and some degree of surveillance. Some bases also contain unique features, such as air bases with numerous aircraft and attendant noise, or seaports with large numbers of naval vessels. Balancing this are extensive areas which are more relaxed in character, for on-base housing, shopping, dining, recreation, sports and entertainment, as well as base chapels which host diverse religious services. However, military regulations, laws and social codes of conduct are in force throughout the base, which can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> local, state or national laws, regulations and customs.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{alternative}} {{theories of}} Child Development {{have been put}} forward, and empirical findings {{have done a lot}} to undermine Piaget's theories. For example, Esther Thelen and colleagues found that babies would not make the A-not-B error if they had small weights added to their arms during {{the first phase of the}} experiment that were then removed before the second phase of the experiment. This minor change should not impact babies' understanding of object permanence, so the difference that this makes to babies' performance on the A-not-B task cannot be explained by Piagetian theory. Thelen and colleagues also found that various other factors also influenced performance on the A-not-B task (including strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time and stance), and proposed that this could be better explained using a dynamic systems theory approach than using Piagetian theory. Alison Gopnik and Betty Repacholi found that babies as young as 18 months old can understand that other people have desires, and that these desires could <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> their own desires. This strongly contradicts Piaget's view that children are very egocentric at this age. In reaction to these challenges, it has been argued that their criticisms depend on a fundamental misreading of Piaget's theory (Louren√ßo & Machado, 1996).|$|E

500|$|The {{band members}} {{decided to keep}} {{publicity}} down during the album's recording, as they were taken aback by such press surrounding Infinity on High. Stump entered the studio with music for almost 50 songs. Folie √† Deux was intended to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the previous three Fall Out Boy albums, which were all interconnected musically and thematically; Stump described the new songs as [...] "having a lot of freedom [...] it's our first just plain old record in a while." [...] However, the sessions proved to {{be difficult for the}} band. Stump called the making of the album [...] "painful", noting that he and Wentz quarreled over many issues, revealing [...] "I threw something across the room over a major-to-minor progression." [...] On previous albums, guitarist Joe Trohman felt that he and drummer Andy Hurley did not have enough musical freedom and that Stump and Wentz exerted too much control over the group: [...] "I felt, 'Man, this isn't my band anymore.' It's no one's fault, and I don't want to make it seem that way. It was more of a complex I developed based off of stuff I was reading. It's hard to hear, 'Joe and Andy are just along for the ride.'" [...] To amend the situation, Trohman sat down with Stump to communicate his concerns, which led to more collaboration on Folie √† Deux. [...] "It made me feel like I owned the songs a lot more. It made me really excited about contributing to Fall Out Boy and made me find my role in the band," [...] Trohman recalled. During the recording sessions Wentz used LSD thinking it could influence his songwriting, he later stopped in July 2008 as it was distracting him from writing songs.|$|E
500|$|According to the 2010 book, The Red Hot Chili Peppers: An Oral/Visual History, Frusciante had {{originally}} {{intended for the}} album to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> how it was eventually completed. Frusciante wanted an album of {{two different types of}} songs: songs that were more [...] "English-sounding" [...] and melodic, and songs that were more punk-rock sounding. Frusciante's punk inspiration came from listening to music by The Damned and Discharge, among others. Rick Rubin was not familiar with the latter bands and sound and thought that the melodic songs were original and more exciting, causing the band to focus mostly on the melodic material. However, one punk rock influenced song was recorded during these sessions, [...] "Body of Water," [...] but did not make the final cut and was instead included on [...] "The Zephyr Song" [...] single. Many of the more melodic inspired songs came from Frusciante being heavily into music by The Beach Boys and The Beatles along with doo-wop groups and their harmonies. These new styles as well as Frusciante being especially prolific during this era came to alienate Flea, who'd wanted the band to return to its earlier funk-influenced sound. Frusciante felt the band had already thoroughly explored funk and was more interested in creating something new for the band. According to Kiedis, Flea felt his voice wasn't being heard, and there was a point where he considered leaving the band. While speaking to Swedish paper Aftonbladet, Frusciante mentioned that he listened to guitarists such as John McGeoch for his work on the Magazine's albums and Siouxsie and the Banshees' Juju, Ron Mael of Sparks [...] for Kimono My House, Johnny Marr of the Smiths, Vini Reilly of The Durutti Column and Keith Levine of PiL. He also credits XTC singer/guitarist Andy Partridge in the 2002 issue of Total Guitar magazine for being an influence on his guitar work for the album.|$|E
