5000|$|Bed {{and breakfast}} is a 21st-century {{phenomenon}} in Spain.

40|$|The major {{purposes}} of this study were to describe families operating <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> breakfast operations in New York State, explore family coping behaviors used by <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> breakfast operators, and examine factors affecting life satisfaction. Results were analyzed from responses of 174 <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> breakfast operators to a questionnaire that elicited data on coping behaviors, demographics, time management, and life satisfaction. Mean scores of coping behaviors indicated that <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> breakfast operators appear to employ most frequently coping behaviors in the maintaining perspective/reducing tension coping pattern. These behaviors reflect a strong positive belief system for the lifestyle. The results of stepwise multiple regression identified as significant predictors of the use of family coping behaviors the hours the spouse contributes to household tasks, the age of the <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> breakfast operator, the hours the <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> breakfast operator contributes to the business, and the presence of children at home full-time;Sixty percent of the respondents were between the ages of 40 and 59, 53 % had educational attainments beyond high school, and 20 % had children at home full-time. Net income generated was less than 5, 000 in 70. 1 % of the businesses. Sixty-eight percent of the <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> breakfast families had one or two family members employed full-time outside of the home and 42. 5 % were operating additional home-based businesses;Female <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> breakfast operators reported spending an average of 28 hours per week in the operation of household tasks and spouses spent 10 hours per week when the <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> breakfast was in operation. When the business was not in operation, females reported spending an average of 20 hours per week in household tasks and the amount of time contributed by spouses remained the same;Bed and breakfast operators appear to be most satisfied with their families and marriages and least satisfied with time for family, time away from the <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> breakfast, time for leisure, and time for self. Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that the number of hours a <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> breakfast operator spends in the business is a negative predictor of life satisfaction and that the age of the <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> breakfast operator is a positive predictor of life satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|Background: Binge-eating {{disorder}} (BED) as {{a distinct}} eating disorder category and night eating syndrome (NES) {{as a form of}} Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders were recently included in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM- 5). Objectives: This study sought to investigate the prevalence of <b>BED</b> <b>and</b> NES and associations with various forms of non-normative eating behavior and psychopathology in prebariatric patients. Setting: Within a consecutive multicenter registry study, patients in six bariatric surgery centers in Germany were recruited. Methods: Overall, 233 prebariatric patients were assessed using the Eating Disorder Examination and self-report questionnaires. Assessment was unrelated to clinical procedures. Results: Diagnostic criteria for full-syndrome <b>BED</b> <b>and</b> NES were currently met by 4. 3 % and 8. 2 % of prebariatric patients, respectively. In addition, 8. 6 % and 6. 9 % of patients met subsyndromal <b>BED</b> <b>and</b> NES criteria, respectively. Comorbid <b>BED</b> <b>and</b> NES diagnoses were present in 3. 9 % of patients. In comparison to patients without any eating disorder symptoms, patients with <b>BED</b> <b>and</b> NES reported greater emotional eating, eating in the absence of hunger, and more symptoms of food addiction. Moreover, differences between patients with <b>BED</b> <b>and</b> NES emerged with more objective binge eating episodes and higher levels of eating concern, weight concern, and global eating disorder psychopathology in patients with <b>BED.</b> Conclusions: <b>BED</b> <b>and</b> NES were shown to be prevalent among prebariatric patients, with some degree of overlap between diagnoses. Associations with non-normative eating behavior and psychopathology point to their clinical significance and discriminant validity...|$|R
