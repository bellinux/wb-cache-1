40|$|Based on {{a unique}} dataset of French {{municipalities}} {{and a large}} number of bud- getary variables, we estimate the extent of spatial fiscal interaction among the 33, 484 French municipalities in 2008 by accounting for inter-municipal cooperation. Using a spatial autoregressive model with inter-municipal group fixed effects, we show that spatial interactions among French municipalities are inflated by correlated effects that affect similarly municipalities that cooperate together. Removing these con- founding effects leads to considerably smaller positive spatial interactions for tax decisions and even negative ones for capital expenditures. In addition, we observe a clear distinction between complementary choices on current <b>budget</b> <b>items</b> and substitutable choices on capital <b>budget</b> <b>items...</b>|$|R
