2500|$|Mary Rothes Margaret Cecil, 2nd Baroness Amherst of Hackney, [...] (née Mary Rothes Margaret Tyssen-Amherst; 25 April 1857 – 21 December 1919) was a British {{hereditary}} peer, charity worker, amateur archaeologist and ornithologist. Thirty-two of the Tombs of the Nobles at Aswan were {{uncovered in}} her excavations {{and for many}} years were known as the [...] "Cecil Tombs". She {{was one of the}} few English women to have held a peerage in her own right. The <b>black</b> <b>crowned</b> <b>crane,</b> balearica pavonia ceciliae was named in her honour.|$|E
2500|$|Returning home, Lady William Cecil {{published}} her findings [...] "Report on the Work Done at Aswan" [...] in the Annales du Service des antiquités de l'Egypte in 1903. In December, 1903, Lord and Lady William Cecil attended Princess Henry of Battenburg {{to return}} to Egypt, having been members of her household for many years. Her second season was not as productive and her work was overshadowed by a discovery made on Elephantine Island of a papyrus engagement contract. The document, in Aramaic script, contained important descriptions of the fortress and city of Aswan {{in the era of}} Artaxerxes I and Darius II and Lady William worked diligently with Howard Carter and others to try to get it published. In 1904, she published Bird Notes from the Nile, which she offered for sale to benefit the parish church of St Mary's Church in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. The book inspired the <b>black</b> <b>crowned</b> <b>crane,</b> balearica pavonia ceciliae to be named in her honour. Other charitable works Lady William supported included the Children's Invalid Aid Fund; London's Queen's Hospital for Children, for which she was one of only two women directors; and the ambulance and hospital works of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, for which she also served as a Lady Justice. Lady William and her husband spent the next several years travelling, visiting Australia in 1905.|$|E

50|$|The Sudd {{provides}} {{food and}} water to large populations of migrating birds; over 400 species of bird are found here, including shoebills, great white pelicans, and <b>black</b> <b>crowned</b> <b>cranes.</b> As the surrounding landscape is a large swath of dry Sahel across Africa, the swamp is also a haven for migrating animals, especially antelopes, such as the endangered Nile lechwe, tiang, reedbuck, and the world's largest population of white-eared kob, estimated at around 1.2 million—an animal population comparable to Tanzania's better-known Serengeti National Park. The shallow water is frequented by crocodiles and hippopotamuses. In more upland areas the Sudd was known as an historic habitat for the endangered painted hunting dog, Lycaon pictus, which however may have been exterminated in the region.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2006, {{the park}} opened [...] "La Plaine Africaine" [...] ("The African plain"), {{an area where}} 130 {{different}} animals - some belonging to rare and protected species - live in freedom on 2.5 acre. The African plain is divided into five parts. The savannah part, where Ankole-Watusis, the Nile lechwes, guineafowls and <b>black</b> <b>crowned</b> <b>cranes</b> can be seen, is the largest. It communicates with the part reserved for giraffes. A wet land houses many breeds of birds, including pelicans and flamingos, and lemurs on an island. An adjacent enclosure is reserved for crocodiles, which are allowed to go out only escape during hot weather. At {{the east end of}} the plain, a pavilion houses the boses for antelopes, and some sandy enclosures adorned with rocks and stumps, where live yellow mongooses, porcupines, sand cats, and bat-eared foxes and turtles. Other areas in reconstruction in 2010 spring, host servals, leopards and lions.|$|R

50|$|The park can be {{accessed}} by three main gates, from Voi through the Manyani gate, from Mombasa through the Bachuma gate or from Malindi through the Sala gate. There are also several airstrips in the park that allow chartered light planes. Inside the park, the Athi and Tsavo rivers converge to form the Galana River. Most of the park consists of semi-arid grasslands and savanna. It {{is considered one of}} the world's biodiversity strongholds, and its popularity is mostly due to the vast amounts of diverse wildlife that can be seen, including the famous 'big five' consisting of Masai lion, black rhino, cape buffalo, elephant and leopard. The park is also home to a great variety of bird life such as the <b>black</b> kite, <b>crowned</b> <b>crane,</b> lovebird and the sacred ibis.|$|R
