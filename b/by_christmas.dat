On 1 April 1914 he was promoted to Air Mechanic First Class.|$|E

A carol service with music {{provided}} by Perins Community School's orchestra precedes the arrival. The Alresford Pigs create the secret process <b>by</b> which Father <b>Christmas</b> arrives. He has arrived in World War 2 NAAFI van driven by Wallace and Gromit and in a Thunderbirds, helicopter, fire engine, Open-top bus, Tardis, and a BMW 5 Series. This is followed <b>by</b> Father <b>Christmas</b> giving presents to children in his grotto. The presents are organised <b>by</b> the <b>Christmas</b> Tree Fund.

5|$|After riding {{at anchor}} for two weeks, Endeavour was heaved {{out of the}} water on 9 November and laid on her side for repairs. Some damaged timbers were found to be infested with shipworms, which {{required}} careful removal to ensure they did not spread throughout the hull. Broken timbers were replaced and the hull recaulked, scraped of shellfish and marine flora, and repainted. Finally, the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England. Repairs and replenishment were completed <b>by</b> <b>Christmas</b> Day 1770, and the next day Endeavour weighed anchor and set sail westward towards the Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1998–99 {{campaign}} began, Gascoigne began {{suffering from}} blackouts after blaming {{himself for the}} death of a friend, who died after Gascoigne and a group of friends went on a night out drinking. Despite his ongoing personal problems and his spell in rehab, Gascoigne started the season in good form and helped Middlesbrough into fourth place <b>by</b> <b>Christmas.</b> They ended the season in ninth place and having scored three goals in 26 top-flight games Gascoigne was linked with a recall to the England squad, who were now managed by former teammate Kevin Keegan and lacking a creative presence in midfield.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1915 Dyer {{was through}} with Australia, the New Zealand Truth {{reporting}} that he had left by 4 December, and <b>by</b> <b>Christmas</b> Eve the American press were already announcing his arrival in the States. In January, Dyer was in San Francisco, where he fought local boxer Bob McAllister, losing on points in a four-round contest. He then travelled to the East Coast and to New York, and on 6 May 1916 {{he was back in}} the ring, in a ten-round fight with local boxer Tommy Maloney. The fight went the distance ending in a draw, though local newspapers gave the decision to Maloney. After the fight Dyer entertained the crowd with an operatic song.|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{was still}} working at the coke works in Selby when his ban was imposed, but <b>by</b> <b>Christmas</b> 1920 the company was sold up and he was laid off. Soon after, however, he was {{approached}} by Huddersfield Town to become assistant to Ambrose Langley, {{who had been a}} former team-mate of Herbert Chapman's brother Harry at The Wednesday. Huddersfield Town backed Chapman in an appeal against his ban, arguing that as he had been working at the factory in Barnbow during the war, he had not been in charge of Leeds City during the time illegal payments were paid. The ban was overturned, and Chapman was formally installed as Langley's assistant on 1 February 1921.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, {{businessmen}} in the Washington, D.C. area became involved and greatly expanded {{the program with}} the Christmas Pageant of Peace. The Pageant centered around the lighting of the Christmas tree, and included various elements such as a life-sized reproduction of the nativity scene. Every year from 1954 to 1972, a tree was cut and brought to the White House from a different US state and installed at the Ellipse. The ceremony of the tree lighting was then followed <b>by</b> <b>Christmas</b> presentations through the holiday season.|$|E
5|$|In {{building}} for the 1982–83 campaign, Charlton signed experienced defender Mick Lyons from Everton and <b>by</b> <b>Christmas</b> Wednesday were top of the table.

They reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, losing 2–1 to Brighton & Hove Albion at Highbury with key player Gary Megson out injured. Charlton announced his departure from Hillsborough in May 1983 despite pleas from the directors for him to stay.|$|E
5|$|In fall 1903, {{the flood}} of miners leaving the Tanana Valley ended when major gold strikes were made north of Fairbanks. The gold was deeper than in the Klondike, and it had taken time to dig to it. At Cleary Creek, miner Jesse Noble {{discovered}} what became the richest vein of gold in Alaska. Gold extraction was slow, because almost no heavy machinery was available to remove the overburden above the layers of gold. The gold discoveries of 1903 reversed the trend of people away from the Tanana Valley. <b>By</b> <b>Christmas</b> 1903, there were between 1,500 and 1,800 miners in the valley. Another food shortage arose {{during the winter of}} 1903, alleviated only by the food Barnette had brought in after his trip to the Lower 48.|$|E

5|$|Published on 19 December, {{the first}} edition sold out <b>by</b> <b>Christmas</b> Eve; {{by the end of}} 1844 {{thirteen}} editions had been released. Most critics reviewed the novella positively. The story was illicitly copied in January 1844; Dickens took action against the publishers, who went bankrupt, reducing further Dickens's small profits from the publication. He went on to write four other Christmas stories in subsequent years. In 1849 he began public readings of the story which proved so successful he undertook 127 further performances until 1870, the year of his death. A Christmas Carol has never been out of print and has been translated into several languages; the story has been adapted many times for film, stage, opera and other media.|$|E

The 30-word recruiting poster was developed as Britons' collective hopes of the war being over <b>by</b> <b>Christmas</b> were dashed in January 1915 and volunteer enlistments fell.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of I-380 opened to traffic on September 19, 1973. That section {{connected}} The Eastern Iowa Airport to I-80 at Coralville. Within three years, the interstate had been extended into Cedar Rapids at the Cedar River. The bridge which crossed the river would not open until June 1979. By the end of 1981, I-380 was a continuous road to the Coldstream Avenue/Glass Road interchange. The interstate was originally scheduled to be open <b>by</b> <b>Christmas</b> 1984, but weather delays pushed back the construction timetable. The last section of I-380 to be completed opened on September 12, 1985.|$|E
