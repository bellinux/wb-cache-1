25|$|Although {{carriage}} {{repair and}} restoration {{is carried out}} {{at a number of}} locations on the railway, the main carriage works is located in the former goods shed at Kidderminster. This building, lying adjacent to the main national railway line, is known as the North Star Carriage Works thus perpetuating a typical GWR name. As well as having a machine shop and fabrication equipment to carry out a full range of body and bogie repairs the carriage works boasts equipment recovered from former BR works to calibrate and adjust dynamo voltage regulators and to thoroughly overhaul and test vacuum <b>brake</b> <b>equipment,</b> a facility that is almost extinct elsewhere. In common with the locomotive works it is not normally open to the public due to health and safety legislation.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} did {{not have}} their own <b>braking</b> <b>equipment.</b> <b>Braking</b> could only be achieved using a hand-operated screw brake on the tender.|$|R

25|$|By 1966 {{they began}} to be painted in {{corporate}} Rail Blue with yellow ends, the change generally coinciding with a works repair and the fitting of air <b>brake</b> <b>equipment,</b> the locomotives originally having only vacuum braking (the first so treated was D9002; the last to be painted blue was D9014). In the early 1970s they were fitted with Electric Train Heating (ETH) equipment to power {{the new generation of}} air-conditioned coaches, while a couple of years later, with the introduction of BR's TOPS computer system, they were renumbered 55 001 to 55 022. In 1979, Finsbury Park restored the white cab window surrounds to their remaining six Deltics, making them distinctive, although these were later painted over when the locomotives were transferred to York during the rundown of the depot at Finsbury Park.|$|E
2500|$|In North America, Westinghouse Air Brake {{supplied}} High Speed Control <b>brake</b> <b>equipment</b> {{for several}} post-World War II streamlined passenger trains. [...] This was an electrically controlled overlay on conventional D-22 passenger and 24-RL locomotive <b>brake</b> <b>equipment.</b> [...] On the conventional side, {{the control valve}} set a reference pressure in a volume, which set brake cylinder pressure via a relay valve. On the electric side, pressure from a second straight-air trainline controlled the relay valve via a two-way check valve. This [...] "straight air" [...] trainline was charged (from reservoirs on each car) and released by magnet valves on each car, controlled electrically by a 3 wire trainline, in turn controlled by an [...] "electro-pneumatic master controller" [...] in the controlling locomotive. This controller compared the pressure in the straight air trainline with that supplied by a self lapping portion of the engineers valve, signaling all of the [...] "apply" [...] or [...] "release" [...] magnets valves in the train to open simultaneously, changing the pressure in the [...] "straight air" [...] trainline much more rapidly and evenly than possible by simply supplying air directly from the locomotive. The relay valve was equipped with four diaphragms, magnet valves, electric control equipment, and an axle-mounted speed sensor, so that at speeds over [...] full braking force was applied, and reduced in steps at [...] , bringing the train to a gentle stop. [...] Each axle was also equipped with anti-lock <b>brake</b> <b>equipment.</b> [...] The combination minimized braking distances, allowing more full-speed running between stops. The [...] "straight air" [...] (electro-pneumatic trainline), [...] anti-lock, and speed graduating portions of the system were not dependent on each other in any way, and {{any or all of}} these options could be supplied separately.|$|E
2500|$|The first HH series locomotive, ALCO {{demonstrator}} #600 was mechanically {{almost identical}} to the others, but the appearance differed. [...] The sides of the locomotive's hood sloped outward from top to bottom, and <b>brake</b> <b>equipment</b> was exposed beneath the cab. [...] After a period of demonstration {{on a number of}} railroads, the unit was sold to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad who numbered it as 0900, this number often being used to describe the locomotive, although the classification on the builder's data card was [...] "404-OE-200". [...] It rode on a unique pattern of trucks. [...] This first unit was built in July 1931.|$|E

50|$|Davies and Metcalfe had an {{arrangement}} with Oerlikon and sold railway air <b>brake</b> <b>equipment</b> {{under the name}} Metcalfe-Oerlikon. This was fitted to some British Railways diesel locomotives, e.g., Classes 45 and 46.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>equipment</b> {{consists}} of pneumatic, electro-pneumatic, regenerative and dynamic brakes. The monomotor bogies {{were derived from}} the Y217 bogies of BB67400 locomotives and have primary (coil springs) and secondary ("sandwich" [...] blocs) suspension.|$|E
5000|$|Equipment {{as built}} {{included}} load sensing [...] "Metacone" [...] air suspension, rheostatic braking, hydraulic parking brake, pneumatic camshaft control by GEC and Brush DC motors of type LT117, with each Dm car having four motors. Air supply was by Reavell reciprocating compressors and <b>braking</b> <b>equipment</b> was by Westinghouse.

40|$|In Chinese {{mainline}} railway, freight trains {{need to stop}} within passenger stations {{at times}} because of the delayed passenger trains. Without any decision-support system, {{it is very difficult}} for drivers to stop trains within stations with consistency in one braking action. The reasons are that braking performance of train changes with the conditions of <b>braking</b> <b>equipment</b> and the drivers’ subjective evaluations of track profiles and braking distance are vague and imprecise. This paper presents a fuzzy neural network (FNN), which is based on the historical datasets of train stops, to model the latest condition of train <b>braking</b> <b>equipment</b> and to attain the braking distance under a predefined braking rate, track profiles, and initial braking speed. The braking distance is used to find the initial braking position to advise the drivers on commencing braking action. Case studies confirm that it is feasible to stop trains within stations in one braking action by applying the proposed approach. Furthermore, the runtime and energy consumption of train movement are both reduced in comparison to the practical two-step action train stopping (TATS); that is, drivers stop trains before entering stations and remotor at a low speed before slowly stopping within stations...|$|R
50|$|Restoration took {{seven years}} and {{included}} fitting a reconditioned boiler and engine. The engine was first steamed in preservation on 26 August 1979. In 1981, vacuum <b>brake</b> <b>equipment</b> was refitted for passenger train working.|$|E
50|$|Specializes in {{domestic}} brake production. The company mainly specializes in <b>brake</b> <b>equipment</b> for types of {{freight and passenger}} carriages, locomotives, motor coach rolling stock, high-speed and extra high-speed trains and rolling stock for underground railways.|$|E

50|$|A third tender {{closed on}} 20 February 1974, for an {{additional}} eight or ten locomotives, this time rated for 2,200hp. The specifications were similar to the as-delivered X37-X44, but with upgraded <b>braking</b> <b>equipment.</b> The reasoning for the order was that, as well as traffic increases (now up to 13.5 million train miles per year), the earlier diesel-electric locomotives were coming due for major overhauls, with no spare motive power to fill the gaps in the rosters (with all steam long-since gone).|$|R
50|$|The ER2 {{is mostly}} {{similar to the}} earlier ER1; the most {{significant}} design changes {{were made to the}} passenger doors (which were now compatible with both high and low passenger platforms, unlike those of the ER1 which were only compatible with high platforms) and the electrical equipment (improved storage batteries and motor-generators). Also, <b>braking</b> <b>equipment</b> was redesigned: the number of braking cylinders was increased, the connecting levers simplified, and automatic adjusters which adjusted the travel of the brake piston rods were deleted.|$|R
5000|$|After World War I, it {{was decided}} that a new braking system needed to be {{developed}} to provide braking power for the ever growing freight train industry. Engineers at New York Air Brake contributed to the development of what {{came to be known as}} the [...] "AB" [...] brake. During the mid-1930s, at the same time the [...] "AB" [...] brake was being widely implemented, the pneumatic and electro-pneumatic <b>braking</b> <b>equipment</b> for modern, high-speed locomotives and passenger trains were engineered and produced at the Watertown facilities.|$|R
