5000|$|Although a <b>bachelor</b> <b>tax</b> {{has been}} viewed more {{recently}} {{as part of a}} tax on childlessness, which were used frequently by member states of the Warsaw Pact, historically, the motives for a <b>bachelor</b> <b>tax</b> were more varied than this. Often, a <b>bachelor</b> <b>tax</b> would be instantiated as part of a moral panic due to the important status given to marriage in these places, where speeches would be held in legislatures (such as the legislatures of New Jersey, Michigan, and Ancient Rome) regarding the supposed libertine or delinquent status of bachelor men. [...] Still other locations would find reason to instantiate a <b>bachelor</b> <b>tax</b> for racial reasons (such as in South Africa), nationalistic reasons, to help cover welfare programs, or more simply as a pure revenue measure.|$|E

5000|$|Much of the film's themes {{revolve around}} gender roles {{and the model}} of masculinity under fascist Italy. Antonietta is the donna madre, a mother figure who meets her {{feminine}} responsibilities in the regime by having six children, boasting one more will secure her the government bonus established for large families in 1933. The Fascist regime equates homosexuality with depopulation, and thus, Gabriele is suspected of treason. The <b>bachelor</b> <b>tax</b> of 1926 was a measure against this, and Gabriele has to pay it. While the stay-at-home mother and homosexual neighbor {{would seem to be}} an improbable pairing, both are minimized by the regime, and find comfort and some sympathy in each other. At the end of the film, domestic life will continue as usual, but [...] "inner resistance" [...] to Fascism has been awakened.|$|E
50|$|The {{state of}} Michigan had made {{repeated}} attempts to instantiate a <b>bachelor</b> <b>tax.</b> In 1837, state senator Edward D.

It was then repeatedly brought up in 1897, 1901, 1911, 1919, with the first resulting in counter proposals for a similar tax to be applied to women who reject marriage proposals and the final resulting in arguments that bachelors had a statistically higher rate of delinquency as opposed to other groups. The final proposed bill that also made the floor of the Michigan congress was in 1935 before it too failed due to economic considerations of the time.|$|E

5000|$|Ludendorff and Bauer, {{who knew}} all the industrialists, set ambitious goals for arms production, in {{what was called the}} Hindenburg Programme, which was {{directed}} by from the War Office by General Groener. Major goals included a new light machine gun, updated artillery, and motor transport, but no tanks because they considered them too vulnerable to artillery. To increase output they needed skilled workers. The army released a million men. [...] For total war, OHL wanted all German men and women from 15 to 60 enrolled for national service. Hindenburg also wanted the universities closed, except for medical training, so that empty places would not be filled by women. To swell the next generation of soldiers he wanted contraceptives banned and <b>bachelors</b> <b>taxed.</b> When a Polish army was being formed he wanted Jews excluded. Few of these ideas were adopted, because their political maneuvering was vigorous but inept, as Admiral Müller of the Military Cabinet observed “Old Hindenburg, like Ludendorff, is no politician, and the latter {{is at the same time}} a hothead.” [...] For example women were not included in the service law that ultimately passed, because in fact more women were already seeking employment than there were openings.|$|R
