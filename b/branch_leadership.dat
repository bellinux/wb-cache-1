After church discipline has ended the membership record will again be updated to remove notice of the disciplinary action. The membership records provided to ward and branch leaders normally do not contain information regarding past discipline; however, a membership record is annotated when a person has been disciplined for incest, sexual or serious physical abuse of a child, plural marriage, an elective transsexual operation, repeated homosexual activities by adults, embezzlement of church funds or property, or other conduct that, in the church's view, [...] "threatens the well being of other persons or of the Church.">LDS Church (2010).

25|$|The first State Secretary of the Victorian {{branch of}} the PTU was former ARU Branch Secretary Peter Bourke.

2500|$|In the meantime, Podemos {{suffered}} an internal crisis {{as a result}} of several member resignations from several of its regional <b>branches</b> <b>leaderships</b> on 10 March amid various accusations to the party's national leadership. Podemos accused the PSOE of attempting to magnify their crisis to pressure them into avoiding a new election by supporting Sánchez, but the crisis aggravated itself on 15 March after Iglesias dismissed Sergio Pascual, the party's Organization Secretary, and close ally to Íñigo Errejón, the party's second-in-command. Pascual's dismissal was explained by Iglesias {{as a result of}} a perceived [...] "lack of neutrality" [...] in his territorial management, but the move forced Errejón out from the public view for several weeks, leading to many to comment that a possible power struggle in Podemos between both Iglesias and Errejón was underway. After scientist Pablo Echenique was unanimously named as Pascual's replacement, and with Errejón reappearing on 29 March to explain that, despite the differences, his allegiance to Podemos' project and Iglesias was total, the crisis seemed to alleviate.|$|R

50|$|The Federal Union under Norm Gallagher faced many protests {{initially}} {{when the}} Federal union intervened {{in the affairs}} of the N.S.W. branch of the union in the mid-seventies. Many of the democratic measures installed by the N.S.W. <b>Branch</b> <b>leadership</b> by Jack Mundey, Bob Pringle and Joe Owens and others were scrapped and many of the democratically imposed Green Bans were lifted. Officials of the N.S.W. Branch eventually urged members to join the imposed branch, but were themselves blacklisted from the industry by Federal Union officials. The Federal takeover of the N.S.W. Branch was instrumental in calling off many of the imposed Green Bans and the cancellation of the union's commitment to fighting for permanence in the building industry.|$|E

50|$|In actuality, {{the culprit}} is the senator's mistress, who uses this {{opportunity}} to lead San Luen and break Hung Hing's grip on their gambling spots in Macau, reinforcing San Luen influence in the area. To that end, Tai Fei willingly allies with her and plots to have Ho Nam's candidacy for the Causeway Bay <b>branch</b> <b>leadership</b> tainted. Ho Nam is barely swayed by Tai Fei's threats, until a car accident cripples his girlfriend Smartie (Gigi Lai), putting her in a coma. Although disheartened at her condition, Ho Nam does not {{back out of the}} candidacy, and plans to stage an intervention at a San Luen opening of a new Macau casino, during which an important member of the Macau government will attend. Ho Nam's sabotage of the event is successful, destroying any credibility San Luen has in Macau and to Tai Fei's nomination.|$|E
50|$|In a tense Mexican {{standoff}} at town square, the senator's mistress and Tai Fei {{decides to}} settle things with Ho Nam and Chicken, summoning hundreds of San Luen and Hung Hing members. While {{it appears the}} victory is in the mistress' hands, it is Tai Fei who turns the gun on her: {{it was all a}} ploy on Hung Hing's part for him to ally with San Luen and provide a means to weed out any corrupt members in the Taiwanese society. Realizing it was she who killed the senator, San Luen's branch leaders decide to take her back to Taiwan for punishment, but Chicken requests he speak with her before she is led away. Upon stating she is the only woman he has ever truly loved, he executes her on the spot, knowing full well she will die more painfully in Taiwan. With the matter settled, Tai Fei abstains from the Causeway Bay <b>branch</b> <b>leadership</b> candidacy and Ho Nam is elected its leader.|$|E
5000|$|This {{decision}} by the al-Douri faction leadership {{was a response to}} complaints by Ba'athist organizations in Shiite-dominated areas on what they considered policy errors which led to marginalization and exclusion of Shiite members. The OCES rejected the decision, and considered them illegitimate. In its statement, the OCES stated that [...] "the failure to implement its decisions is considered a rebellion against legitimate authority ..." [...] and “a conscious and explicit threat, and an attempt to impose a bitter reality through decisions that are tainted by sectarian and regional motivations." [...] In its ending remarks, the OCES statement read [...] "any connection or link with any member of the Iraqi <b>branch</b> <b>leadership</b> locally or abroad, while continuing organizational activities according to the Organizations of Central Euphrates and the South leadership’s decisions that were reached last year based on prior understandings with the national leadership". Despite breaking with al-Douri's faction, al-Karafi's faction has not aligned itself with either al-Ahmed's faction or Resurrection and Renewal Movement, a third Ba'athist group.|$|E

The Al Miqrin <b>branch</b> under the <b>leadership</b> of Muhammad ibn Saud finally managed to {{consolidate}} power, by forging a close fellowship with Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, to form the First Saudi State which manifested in 1744.|$|R
