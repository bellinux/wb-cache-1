5|$|When the {{drafts of}} the books were shown to De Beers they objected {{to a number of}} areas and {{threatened}} an injunction against Fleming and The Sunday Times, which resulted in much material being removed. The Sunday Times serialised the <b>book</b> <b>over</b> six weeks, starting on 15 September 1957 and finishing on 20 October 1957.|$|E
5|$|Scholars cannot {{pinpoint}} the exact date of composition. Orm wrote his <b>book</b> <b>over</b> {{a period of}} decades and the manuscript shows signs of multiple corrections through time (Burchfield 1987, p.280). Since it is apparently an autograph, {{with two of the}} three hands in the text generally believed by scholars to be Orm's own, the date of the manuscript and the date of composition would have been the same. On the evidence of the third hand (that of a collaborator who entered the pericopes at the head of each homily) it is thought that the manuscript was finished circa 1180, but Orm may have begun the work as early as 1150 (Parkes 1983, pp.115–27). The text has few topical references to specific events {{that could be used to}} identify the period of composition more precisely.|$|E

25|$|Wisden is a small-paged but a {{very thick}} <b>book</b> (<b>over</b> 1,500 pages in modern editions) with a {{distinctive}} bright yellow cover that it has carried since the 75th edition in 1938.

It is published each April, just {{before the start of the}} English domestic cricket season. Since 2003 the woodcut has been replaced as the main feature of the front cover by a photograph of a current cricketer, but still appears albeit in a much reduced size.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, Garner {{became the}} editor in chief of Black's Law Dictionary, whose roots are {{traceable}} to 1891 and which is currently the most widely respected authority on Anglo-American legal lexicography. Since 1995, Garner has overhauled the <b>book</b> <b>over</b> the course of four unabridged editions (7th–10th). He created a panel of international legal experts to improve all the specialized vocabulary in the book, including Roman law, international law, and transactional terminology. With the help of these experts, Garner and his team have rewritten the entire dictionary and added tens of thousands of new entries, amplifying many with dates of linguistic origin; supplementary usage, historical, or other lexicographic information; and exemplary quotations drawn from myriad sources in the literature on Anglo-American law—some as early as the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|Development {{for both}} The Lightning Thief and the Percy Jackson series {{commenced}} when Rick Riordan began making stories {{for his son}} Haley Riordan, who {{had at the time}} been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. His son, Haley, had been studying Greek mythology in second grade and requested that his father tell him bedtime stories based on Greek myths. When Riordan ran out of myths, his son suggested that he make up new stories using existing mythological characters and new ones. This led Riordan to create the fictional character of Percy Jackson and create the story of how he travels across the United States to recover Zeus's lightning-bolt. Haley suggested that he should turn that story into a book, and Riordan wrote the <b>book</b> <b>over</b> the next year despite being busy at that time.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson {{received}} a letter of inquiry in 1780 about the geography, history, and government of Virginia from French diplomat François Barbé-Marbois, who was gathering data on the United States. Jefferson included his written responses in a book, Notes on the State of Virginia (1785). He compiled the <b>book</b> <b>over</b> five years, including reviews of scientific knowledge, Virginia's history, politics, laws, culture, and geography. The book explores what constitutes a good society, using Virginia as an exemplar. Jefferson included extensive data about the state's natural resources and economy, and wrote at length about slavery, miscegenation, and his belief that blacks and whites could not live together as free people in one society because of justified resentments of the enslaved. He also wrote of his views on the American Indian and considered them as equals in body and mind to European settlers.|$|E

Wellek and Warren were soon in agreement over several aspects of literature, and by 1940 they had begun considering collaboration on a <b>book.</b> <b>Over</b> {{the next several years}} they furthered their understandings of European and American literature theory through discussions with Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren, and extensive reading of contemporary European writings.|$|E

Matthews, then 84, collaborated with Les Scott, his friend of 10 years, {{in the writing of}} the <b>book</b> <b>over</b> an 18-month period on an almost daily basis. [...] "Stan, as he had been all his life, was an early riser," [...] wrote Scott in the epilogue. [...] "Our collaborations were over by eleven in the morning and, without fail, took place in his den. He loved working on his book and, after I had left him, he would give the morning's session more applied thought — more often than not ringing me at home to provide additional thoughts or anecdotes." ...|$|E

His Wales international teammate John Charles commented on his playing style, stating that [...] "He used to bang everybody and knock {{them out of the}} way, he was never frightened" [...] but also described him as a wonderful person. Former England international Gil Merrick accused Ford of maltreating goalkeepers in his autobiography, although Ford later sued Merrick, stating that he had never been cautioned or sent off over his style of play, and received an apology and the withdrawal of the <b>book</b> <b>over</b> the claim. Ford himself stated that his personality was transformed once he stepped onto a football pitch, describing himself as [...] "Like an animal" [...] but also commenting that he was simply [...] "doing his job and doing it well" [...] Billy Bingham later stated [...] "He got some terrible knocks from goalkeepers but he also knew how to dish it out and he never complained to refs".|$|E

[...] Mewt comes across a dusty old tome in a local used bookstore and eagerly wishes to show it to his friends. Unaware that the book is the legendary Gran Grimoire, Mewt brings the <b>book</b> <b>over</b> to Marche's house along with Ritz. The old book is written in a language none of them have ever seen before, and a single inscription reads: [...] "Alta oron, Sondus kameela". The next morning, Marche wakes up in the world of Ivalice. The fantasy Ivalice is supposedly a reincarnation of Mewt's memories from a Final Fantasy game.|$|E
500|$|Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown, {{producers}} at Universal Pictures, independently {{heard about}} Peter Benchley's novel Jaws. Brown came across {{it in the}} literature section of lifestyle magazine Cosmopolitan, then edited by his wife, Helen Gurley Brown. A small card written by the magazine's book editor gave {{a detailed description of}} the plot, concluding with the comment [...] "might make a good movie". The producers each read the <b>book</b> <b>over</b> the course of a single night and agreed the next morning that it was [...] "the most exciting thing that they had ever read" [...] and that they wanted to produce a film version, although they were unsure how it would be accomplished. They purchased the movie rights in 1973, before the book's publication, for approximately $175,000 (equivalent to $ million in [...] ). Brown claimed that had they read the book twice, they would never have made the film because they would have realized how difficult it would be to execute certain sequences.|$|E
500|$|The comic book's initial cancellation, and the {{introduction}} of the character to DC led to many negative feedback and reception. I, Vampire writer Joshua Hale Fialkov expressed sadness he would never get to write [...] "the 'real' John Constantine", noted crime author and former Hellblazer writer Ian Rankin stated that Constantine was the only comic book character he ever wanted to write for, and Alan Moore's daughter, Leah Moore expressing doubt that Constantine could replace Hellblazer, among others. As a result, DC co-publisher Dan Didio issued a statement defending this decision, stating that, [...] "Hellblazer's had a long and incredibly successful run and that's a tip of the hat to all the great creators that have worked on the <b>book</b> <b>over</b> the years. The new Constantine series will return him back to his roots in the DCU and hopefully be the start of another incredible run."

500|$|Paolini and {{his family}} toured across the United States {{promoting}} the <b>book.</b> <b>Over</b> 135 talks were given at bookshops, libraries, and schools, many with Paolini dressed up in a medieval costume; but the book did not receive much attention. Paolini said he [...] "would stand behind a table in my costume talking all day without a break– and would sell maybe forty books in eight hours if I did really well. [...] It was a very stressful experience. I couldn't have gone on for very much longer." [...] In the summer of 2002, American novelist Carl Hiaasen was on vacation {{in one of the}} cities that Paolini gave a talk in. While there, Hiaasen's stepson bought a copy of Eragon that he [...] "immediately loved". He showed it to Hiaasen, who brought the book {{to the attention of the}} publishing house Alfred A. Knopf. Michelle Frey, executive editor at Knopf, contacted Paolini {{and his family}} to ask if they were interested in having Knopf publish Eragon. The answer was yes, and after another round of editing, Knopf published Eragon in August 2003, with a new cover, drawn by John Jude Palencar.|$|E
2500|$|The {{legacy of}} the codex {{is based on the}} life and death of Saint Boniface who, in 753, had gone off to Friesland one more time to try and convert the Frisians. On the morning of June 5, 754, Boniface, camping in the Frisian {{countryside}} with 50 or so comrades, was getting ready to accept new converts, when the camp was overrun by pagan bandits who killed all the missionaries and destroyed their possessions. While the earliest hagiographical accounts of Boniface and his martyrdom had him order his comrades to lay down their arms and accept martyrdom willingly, later accounts added that he held a <b>book</b> <b>over</b> his head to protect himself—this is what Boniface scholar Lutz von Padberg calls the Schutzhypothese, the [...] "protection hypothesis", and it has become an enduring image of the saint.|$|E
2500|$|Thompson's most {{influential}} work was and remains The Making of the English Working Class, published in 1963 {{while he was}} working at the University of Leeds. The massive <b>book,</b> <b>over</b> 800 pages, was a watershed in the foundation of the field of social history. By exploring the ordinary cultures of working people through their previously ignored documentary remains, Thompson told the forgotten history of the first working-class political left in the world in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. [...] Reflecting on the importance of the book for its 50th anniversary, Emma Griffin explained that Thompson [...] "uncovered details about workshop customs and rituals, failed conspiracies, threatening letters, popular songs, and union club cards. He took what others had regarded as scraps from the archive and interrogated them for what they told us about the beliefs and aims of those who were not on the winning side. Here, then, was a book that rambled over aspects of human experience that had never before had their historian.|$|E
