5|$|For {{clarity of}} presentation, the {{diagrams}} {{in this article}} are drawn with the components implemented in stripline format. This does not imply an industry preference, although planar transmission line formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular because they can <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> using established printed circuit board manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> using microstrip or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in integrated circuit designs.|$|E

5|$|According to the plan, {{the type}} of {{consumption}} (i.e. whether agricultural, industrial and civil) will also be considered when setting energy prices.
