25|$|Investors may not {{be members}} of stock exchanges. Rather they must buy and sell {{securities}} through broker-dealers which are registered with the appropriate regulatory body for that purpose. In accepting investors as clients, broker-dealers take on the risks of their clients {{not being able to}} meet their financial obligations. Hence retail (individual) investors generally are required to keep their investment assets in custody with the <b>broker-dealer</b> through which they buy and sell securities. A <b>broker-dealer</b> would normally not accept an order to buy from a retail clients unless there is sufficient cash on deposit with the <b>broker-dealer</b> {{to cover the cost of}} the order, nor sell unless the client already has the security in the broker-dealer's custody.|$|E
50|$|The same 1980 SEC Release noted a clear {{distinction}} {{in the application of}} the net capital rule. Most <b>broker-dealers</b> used the Basic Method.

50|$|The uniform {{net capital}} rule is a rule {{created by the}} U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in 1975 to {{regulate}} directly the ability of <b>broker-dealers</b> to meet their financial obligations to customers and other creditors. <b>Broker-dealers</b> are companies that trade securities for customers (i.e., brokers) and for their own accounts (i.e., dealers).|$|R

Although the Act does not create such a duty immediately, the Act authorizes the SEC to establish such a standard and requires that the SEC study the standards of care that <b>broker-dealers</b> and investment advisers apply to their customers and report to Congress on the results within 6 months. Under the law, commission and limited product range would not violate the duty and <b>broker-dealers</b> {{would not have a}} continuing duty after the investment advice is given.|$|R

This division also interprets proposed changes to regulations and monitors operations of the industry. In practice, the SEC delegates most of its enforcement and rulemaking authority to FINRA. In fact, all trading firms not regulated by other SROs must register as a member of FINRA. Individuals trading securities must pass exams administered by FINRA to become registered representatives.|$|E

25|$|Bank of America possessed {{combined}} {{assets of}} $570billion, {{as well as}} 4,800 branches in 22 states. Despite the mammoth size of the two companies, federal regulators insisted only upon the divestiture of 13 branches in New Mexico, in towns that would be left with only a single bank following the combination. (Branch divestitures are only required if the combined company will have a larger than 25% Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit market share in a particular state or 10% deposit market share overall.) In addition, the combined <b>broker-dealer,</b> created from the integration of BancAmerica Robertson Stephens and NationsBanc Montgomery Securities, was named Banc of America Securities in 1998.|$|E
25|$|ETFs {{are similar}} in many ways to {{traditional}} mutual funds, except that shares in an ETF can be bought and sold throughout the day like stocks on a stock exchange through a <b>broker-dealer.</b> Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs do not sell or redeem their individual shares at net asset value (NAV). Instead, financial institutions purchase and redeem ETF shares directly from the ETF, but only in large blocks (such as 50,000 shares), called creation units. Purchases and redemptions of the creation units generally are in kind, with the institutional investor contributing or receiving a basket of securities of the same type and proportion held by the ETF, although some ETFs may require or permit a purchasing or redeeming shareholder to substitute cash for {{some or all of}} the securities in the basket of assets.|$|E
500|$|During Fletcher Asset Management's {{first four}} years, it traded with heavy leverage. [...] His general {{strategy}} was trading public instruments {{for his own}} account and on behalf of clients, but he also made longer-term equity investments. He used hedges with both types of investments. He has also been involved in PIPE deals. At one time, his firm's trading activity occasionally accounted for 5% of the volume on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1994, Fletcher surrendered his <b>broker-dealer</b> registration and became a registered investment adviser, which made managing money more convenient.|$|E

2500|$|In asset {{management}} and securities industries, soft dollars are the benefits provided to an asset manager by a <b>broker-dealer</b> {{as a result}} of commissions generated from financial transaction executed by the <b>broker-dealer</b> for client accounts or funds managed by the asset manager. In a soft dollar arrangement, the investment manager directs commissions generated by a client's or fund's transactions to a <b>broker-dealer</b> or other trading venue. Soft dollars, in contrast to hard dollars (actual cash) which have to be reported, are incorporated into brokerage fees and paid expenses, which may not be reported separately (partly due to the difficulty in their valuation. Most investment managers follow the limitations detailed in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. [...] In particular, if soft dollar arrangements are entered into with respect to registered investment companies and pension plans (ERISA and public plans), compliance with Section 28(e) is generally required. [...] However, hedge funds, which are generally not registered, may not be subject to the limitations of Section 28(e) and, thus, in some cases, the fund's commissions may be used for the adviser's benefit. In situations where fund commissions are used outside of the Section 28(e) safe harbor, full and comprehensive disclosure must be provided to fund investors.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} illegal use of {{undisclosed}} soft dollars might be when {{a mutual fund}} manager pays commissions to a <b>broker-dealer</b> and in return the <b>broker-dealer</b> provides furniture for the fund adviser's use. [...] Likewise, the adviser to a registered mutual fund cannot send brokerage to a wire-house for providing [...] "shelf space" [...] and marketing favoritism for the family of funds. Such brokerage arrangements, where favors are traded in exchange for institutional clients' excess commissions have been criticized by securities regulators. Full-service brokerage bundled commission arrangements involving the exchange of brokerage firms' undisclosed proprietary services provided for institutional clients' brokerage commissions (paid in excess of a fully negotiated execution-only commission rate) can create conflicts of interest. The lack of transparency in these full-service brokerage arrangements may shield abuses from immediate detection.|$|E
2500|$|To sell stocks {{short in}} the U.S., the seller must {{arrange for a}} <b>broker-dealer</b> to confirm that it can deliver the shorted securities. This is {{referred}} to as a locate.

2500|$|US equities, {{corporate}} and municipal bonds can be issued in certificated form, though this practice {{has been largely}} replaced due to the costs and inefficiencies of keeping them. Rather holdings are kept as [...] "immobilized" [...] or [...] "street name", with the beneficial owners keeping them in accounts at <b>broker-dealers</b> and banks, {{just as they do}} for currencies. DTCC uses a nominee firm, Cede & Co., in whose name a share certificate is held in the DTCC vaults. Each day DTCC reconciles with the relevant transfer agent the number of shares held in its accounts for its member banks and <b>broker-dealers.</b> In turn, other banks and <b>broker-dealers</b> hold accounts with DTCC member firms, creating a chain of ownership down to the beneficial owner.|$|R
50|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the excesses of the 1990s referred to above, Eliot Spitzer, Governor of the State of New York, asserted a significant role in policing securities research performed by New York-based analysts; it is unclear whether oversight by the New York State Attorney General will become a long-term meaningful component of securities research. The going-forward conduct provisions of a master settlement agreement between (on the one hand) most of the aforesaid U.S. regulators and (on the other hand) many of the largest U.S. <b>broker-dealers,</b> is an important source of ongoing regulation, with the force of law for the <b>broker-dealers</b> who are party to it, and a strong, if not formally legally binding effect, on <b>broker-dealers</b> not party to it.|$|R
