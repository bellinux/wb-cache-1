5|$|The war-time {{deployment}} of the Territorial Army envisioned it <b>being</b> <b>deployed</b> piecemeal, to reinforce the regular army already deployed to the European mainland, as equipment became available. The plan envisioned the {{deployment of}} the whole force in waves, as divisions completed their training, with the final divisions <b>being</b> <b>deployed</b> {{a year after the}} outbreak of war. As a result, the division did not leave the United Kingdom as the British Expeditionary Force was evacuated from France during May and June 1940. On 28 October, Major-General Noel Irwin, who had commanded the 2nd Infantry Division during the latter stages of the fighting in France, was given command of the 38th.|$|E

Understanding how learners use these systems and relating this use back to pedagogical and institutional goals is a hard issue that has largely been unexplored. This work describes a novel web-based lecture presentation system which contains fine-grained user tracking features. These features, along with student surveys, have been used to help analyse the behaviour of hundreds of students over an academic term, quantifying both the learning approaches of students and their perceptions on learning with lecture capture...|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} of the court-martial in August 1944, the charges against Robinson had been reduced to two counts of insubordination during questioning. Robinson was acquitted by an all-white panel of nine officers. The {{experiences}} Robinson was subjected to during the court proceedings would be remembered when he later joined MLB and was subjected to racist attacks. Although his former unit, the 761st Tank Battalion, became the first black tank unit to see combat in World War II, Robinson's court-martial proceedings prohibited him from <b>being</b> <b>deployed</b> overseas; thus, he never saw combat action.|$|E
5|$|Despite its name, the 6th Airborne Division {{was one of}} {{only two}} {{airborne}} divisions raised by the British Army during the Second World War. Before <b>being</b> <b>deployed</b> to Palestine, the division had served only in Europe. It had participated in the Normandy landings in June 1944 and later the Battle of the Bulge in December. After the Rhine crossing in March 1945, it spent six weeks advancing across Germany to the Baltic Sea.|$|E

30|$|Although dynamic {{analysis}} surpasses the static analysis in many aspects, {{dynamic analysis}} {{also has some}} drawbacks. Firstly, dynamic analysis requires too many resources relative to static analysis, which hinders it from <b>being</b> <b>deploying</b> on resource constraint smartphone. Secondly, dynamic analysis is subject to low code coverage. Sasnauskas and Regehr (2014) mentioned that producing highly structured inputs that get high code coverage is an open research challenge. Thirdly, recently malware attempts to detect the emulator and other dynamic analysis systems (Vidas and Christin 2014; Petsas et al. 2014; Jing et al. 2014), avoiding launching their payloads. Thus, some dynamic analysis systems are prone to analysis evasion.|$|R

5|$|The 4th Army was a Royal Yugoslav Army {{formation}} mobilised {{prior to}} the German-led Axis invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941 during World War II. It was drawn from the peacetime 4th Army District. When mobilised, it consisted of three divisions, a brigade-strength detachment, one horse cavalry regiment and one independent infantry regiment. It formed part of the 1st Army Group, and was responsible for defending a large section of the Yugoslav–Hungarian border, <b>being</b> <b>deployed</b> behind the Drava river between Varaždin and Slatina.|$|E
5|$|The Apache was {{a valued}} form of {{close air support}} in the {{conflict}} in Afghanistan, <b>being</b> <b>deployed</b> to the region in 2006. The Apache has been an object of controversy over the fitting of some weapons, such as cluster munitions. Naval trials and temporary deployments at sea have proven the aircraft as an able platform to operate from the decks of ships, which is a unique application of the Apache amongst its operators. British Apaches served in the NATO 2011 military intervention in Libya operating from Royal Navy ships.|$|E
5|$|Byng {{allocated}} the Third Army's IV Corps to {{the forthcoming}} operation, {{which was to}} {{become known as the}} Second Battle of Bapaume. IV Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General George Harper comprised five divisions, all of which would be employed during the battle. The first three to be involved were the New Zealand Division along with the 37th and 42nd Divisions. The other two divisions, the 5th and the 63rd Divisions, were held in reserve before <b>being</b> <b>deployed</b> later in the battle. Of all these divisions, only the New Zealand Division was at full strength. Facing the Third Army was the German 17th Army, commanded by General der Infanterie (General of the Infantry) Otto von Below, made up of eight divisions which, apart from the 4th Bavarian Infantry Division, were all second class formations. A further two divisions were in reserve.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the ship}} was {{extended}} due to ventilation problems discovered during sea trials, which necessitated lengthy modifications.

She was present during the Boxer Rebellion and took part in the Battle of Taku Forts in 1900. Gefion returned to Germany in late 1901, where she was modernized and then placed in reserve. She was to be recommissioned after the start of World War I, but shortages of personnel prevented her return to active service. Instead, she was used as a barracks ship. After the war, she was converted into a freighter and renamed Adolf Sommerfeld, though the conversion was not particularly successful and she was scrapped in 1923.|$|E
5|$|During the 1992 campaign, it was {{revealed}} that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from <b>being</b> <b>deployed</b> to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then. Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service. Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.|$|E
