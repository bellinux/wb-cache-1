5|$|In 2015–2016, {{percentage}} {{share of}} Gross Value Added (GVA) at factor cost by Economic Activity at constant price (<b>base</b> <b>year</b> 2011–2012) was Agriculture-Forestry and Fishery – 14.84%, Industry 18.51% and Services 66.65%. It {{has been observed}} {{that there has been}} a slow but steady decline in the percentage share of industry and agriculture over the years. Agriculture is the leading economic sector in West Bengal. Rice is the state's principal food crop. Rice, potato, jute, sugarcane, and wheat are the top five crops of the state. Tea is produced commercially in northern districts; the region is well known for Darjeeling and other high quality teas. State industries are localised in the Kolkata region, the mineral-rich western highlands, and the Haldia port region. The Durgapur–Asansol colliery belt is home to a number of major steel plants. Important manufacturing industries are engineering products, electronics, electrical equipment, cables, steel, leather, textiles, jewellery, frigates, automobiles, railway coaches, and wagons. The Durgapur centre has established a number of industries in the areas of tea, sugar, chemicals, and fertilisers. Natural resources like tea and jute in and nearby parts has made West Bengal a major centre for the jute and tea industries.|$|E
25|$|Emissions {{may also}} be {{measured}} across shorter time periods. Emissions changes may, for example, be measured against a <b>base</b> <b>year</b> of 1990. 1990 {{was used in the}} United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as the <b>base</b> <b>year</b> for emissions, and is also used in the Kyoto Protocol (some gases are also measured from the year 1995). A country's emissions {{may also be}} reported as a proportion of global emissions for a particular year.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposition}} decreased {{property taxes}} by assessing property values at their 1975 value and restricted annual increases of assessed value of real property to an inflation factor, {{not to exceed}} 2% per year.

25|$|Modern {{productivity}} {{researchers have}} shown that the period in which the greatest economic and technological progress occurred was between {{the last half of the}} 19th century and the first half of the 20th. During this period the nation was transformed from an agricultural economy to the foremost industrial power in the world, with more than a third of the global industrial output. This can be illustrated by the index of total industrial production, which increased from 4.29 in 1790 to 1,975.00 in 1913, an increase of 460 times (<b>base</b> <b>year</b> 1850 – 100).|$|E

25|$|Certain {{players in}} {{the first few months of}} a new {{contract}} are subject to <b>base</b> <b>year</b> compensation (BYC). The intent of BYC is to prevent teams from re-signing players to salaries specifically targeted to match other salaries in a trade (in other words, salary should be based on basketball value, not trade value). A BYC player's trade value as outgoing salary is 50% of his new salary, or his previous salary, whichever is greater. BYC applies only to players who re-sign with their previous team and receive a raise greater than 20%. It also applies only when (and as long as) the team is over the salary cap. Under the 2011 CBA, players subject to BYC cannot be traded before January 15 except in a sign-and-trade, and BYC is only applied to outgoing salary in sign-and-trade deals.|$|E
25|$|The {{property}} may be reassessed {{under certain}} conditions other than a change of ownership, such as when additions or new construction occur. The assessed value is also subject to reduction if {{the market value of}} the property declines below its assessed value, for example, during a real estate slump. Reductions of property valuation were not provided for by Proposition 13 itself, but were made possible by the passage of Proposition 8 (SCA No. 67) during 1978 that amended Proposition 13. Such a real estate slump and downward reassessments occurred during 2009 when the California State Board of Equalization announced an estimated reduction of property tax <b>base</b> <b>year</b> values due to negative inflation. The property tax in California is an Ad valorem tax meaning that the tax assessed (generally) increases and decreases with the value of the property.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) {{noted that}} it {{expected}} New Zealand {{to be able to}} increase emissions and comply with the Kyoto Protocol, and make an economic gain. Not withstanding the Annex B reduction target of 100% of the 1990 <b>base</b> <b>year</b> gross emissions, New Zealand would be able to emit more than its initial assigned amount as long as more emission units were obtained from forest carbon sinks between 2008 and 2012. MFAT predicted that New Zealand would emit between 50 and 75 million tonnes of greenhouse gases more than the 365 million tonnes of the initial assigned amount during the first commitment period. However, MFAT considered that the increase in emissions would be offset by about 110 million Removal Units (RMU) originating from forests planted from 1990 onwards (post-1989 forests.|$|E
