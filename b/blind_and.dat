PAN {{is not a good}} diagnostic tool for measuring <b>blinded</b> <b>and</b> not <b>blinded</b> root length <b>and</b> root resorptions.

5|$|Females den {{in hollow}} trees. Kits are born <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> helpless. They are {{partially}} covered with fine hair. Kits begin to crawl after about 3 weeks.

Kits are completely {{dependent on their}} mother's milk for the first 8–10 weeks, after which they begin {{to switch to a}} solid diet.

5|$|Flea larvae {{emerge from}} the eggs to feed on any {{available}} organic material such as dead insects, faeces, conspecific eggs, and vegetable matter. In laboratory studies, some dietary diversity seems necessary for proper larval development. Blood-only diets allow only 12% of larvae to mature, whereas blood and yeast or dog chow diets allow almost all larvae to mature. Another study also showed that 90% of larvae matured into adults when the diet included nonviable eggs. They are <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> avoid sunlight, keeping to dark, humid places such as sand or soil, cracks and crevices, under carpets and in bedding.|$|E
