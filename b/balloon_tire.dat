25|$|A cruiser bicycle, {{also known}} as a beach cruiser or (formerly) motobike, is a bicycle that usually {{combines}} <b>balloon</b> <b>tires,</b> an upright seating posture, a single-speed drivetrain, and straightforward steel construction with expressive styling. Cruisers are popular among casual bicyclists and vacationers because they are very stable and easy to ride, but their heavy weight and <b>balloon</b> <b>tires</b> tend to make them rather slow. They are designed for use primarily on paved roads, moderate speeds/distances, and are included in the non-racing/non-touring class and heavyweight or middleweight styles of the road bicycle type.|$|R

50|$|Nearly {{twenty years}} after the {{original}} Musselman design appeared on the market, Phipps designed and constructed his own <b>balloon</b> <b>tires</b> in the period after the Second World War and fitted them to a Piper PA-18 Super Cub. Phipps {{then went on to}} provide air transportation to much of the Canadian high arctic region. He later established his own airline, Atlas Aviation, which operated a fleet of De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters on <b>balloon</b> <b>tires.</b> Using the tires, Atlas's DHC-6s established airline service to such remote communities as Resolute, Nunavut and Grise Fiord, Nunavut.|$|R
25|$|Like the Chief, the Four {{was given}} large, skirted fenders and plunger rear {{suspension}} in 1940. In 1941, the 18-inch wheels of previous models were replaced with 16-inch wheels with <b>balloon</b> <b>tires.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tire {{lettering}} can {{be traced}} back as far as 1922, when Firestone Tire and Rubber Company launched its <b>balloon</b> <b>tires</b> on April 5, 1922., stenciling the Firestone brand name onto the tire.|$|R
5000|$|... ====Balloon tires==== A <b>balloon</b> <b>tire</b> {{is a type}} of wide, large-volume, {{low-pressure}} tire {{that first}} appeared on cruiser bicycles in the USA in the 1930s. They are typically 2 to 2.5 in wide.|$|E
50|$|This {{well-known}} collection, previously {{located at}} the Navy Pier in Chicago, is expected to attract bicycle enthusiasts {{from around the world}} to New Bremen. The museum houses elegant antique bicycles from the 19th century, <b>balloon</b> <b>tire</b> classics of the 1940s and 1950s and even the banana seat high-rise handle bar bikes of the 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Balloon</b> <b>Tire</b> Classics (1933-1965)—This {{period is}} {{dominated}} by the cruiser style bicycles of Schwinn and other manufacturers. These bikes featured wide balloon tires and heavy frames, for improved durability. The children’s market was a focus during this era, leading to elaborate streamline styling and loads of accessories: lights, speedometers, springer (suspension) forks, horns, luggage racks, and more. These bikes were neglected and abused until the mid 1970s when Leon Dixon began penning a series of articles for magazines such as Popular Mechanics and organized the earliest collector swap meets. Soon prices of old cruisers began to rise. Today, this is probably the most popular area of bike collecting.|$|E

They were [...] all around. <b>Balloon</b> <b>tires</b> were closer in design to today's tires, with steel wires reinforcing the tire bead, making lower pressure possible – typically [...] – giving a softer ride. The old nomenclature for tire size changed from measuring the outer diameter to measuring the rim diameter so [...] (rim diameter) × [...] (tire width) wheels has {{about the same}} outer diameter as 30 in (76cm) clincher tires. All tires in this time period used an inner tube to hold the pressurized air; tubeless tires were not generally in use until much later.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} {{mountain bikes}} were modified heavy cruiser bicycles used for freewheeling down mountain trails. The sport became {{popular in the}} 1970s in Northern California, USA with riders using older single speed <b>balloon</b> <b>tire</b> bicycles to ride down rugged hillsides. Joe Breeze, a bicycle frame builder, used this idea and developed what is considered the first mountain bike. [...] The 2006 documentary film, Klunkerz: A Film About Mountain Bikes, looks at this period of off-road cycling in detail. However, {{it was not until}} the late 1970s and early 1980s that road bicycle companies started to manufacture mountain bicycles using high-tech lightweight materials, such as M4 aluminium. The first production Mountain bike available was the 1979 Lawwill Pro Cruiser. The frame design was based on a frame that Don Koski fabricated from electrical conduit and a Schwinn Varsity frame. Mert Lawwill had Terry Knight of Oakland build the frames. The bikes sold for about $500 new and were made from 1979 though 1980 (approximate run of 600 bikes).The first mass production mountain bike was the Specialized Stumpjumper, first produced in 1981. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, mountain biking moved from a little-known sport to a mainstream activity complete with an international racing circuit and a world championship, in addition to various freeride competitions, such as the FMB World Tour and the Red Bull Rampage.|$|E
50|$|For 1940, the Four {{frame was}} {{modified}} to include plunger rear suspension. In the same year, all Indian models were restyled with large, decorative fenders. In 1941, the 18-inch wheels of previous models were replaced with 16-inch wheels with <b>balloon</b> <b>tires.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mudding is off-roading {{through an}} area of wet mud or clay. The goal is to drive through as far as {{possible}} without becoming stuck. There are many types of tires that are recommended for this activity. Some <b>tires</b> are <b>balloon</b> <b>tires,</b> mud-terrain tires and paddle tires. This activity is very popular in the United States, although it is illegal on public land due to the environmental impact.|$|R
50|$|Throughout its {{production}} run, the Model T saw relatively few changes. In addition to changes to refine {{its production}} (which dictated its specification of black paint), technological upgrades were made along the way. Ford added electric lights (in 1910), electric starting (1919), <b>balloon</b> <b>tires</b> (1925), and wire wheels (1926).|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s Raleigh {{made its}} small-wheeled RSW 16 with <b>balloon</b> <b>tires</b> {{so it would}} have a soft ride like the fully {{suspended}} Moulton Bicycle. Other manufacturers then used the same idea for their own small wheelers. Examples include the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) Commuter, the Trusty Spacemaster and the Stanningley (UK)-made Bootie Folding Bicycle.|$|R
50|$|John Sipe's {{invention}} was unsuccessful. It {{was applied}} to solid rubber tires, rather than pneumatic tires, and so the tires had poor wet grip anyway, owing to their limited contact patch. It was his son, Harry E. Sipe, who popularised the use of sipes in the USA for the new low-pressure <b>balloon</b> <b>tires</b> around 1939.|$|R

5000|$|The designer, Stace Schrader was {{formerly}} involved with Avid Aircraft, the Denney Kitfox and Sky Raider LLC designs, all similar aircraft. The resulting aircraft {{was described by}} reviewer Andre Cliche as [...] "a clone identical to its predecessors {{except for a few}} details like, for example the type of ailerons and <b>balloon</b> <b>tires</b> for rough terrain operations." ...|$|R
50|$|Other models, {{such as the}} ATC250SX were sold. The ATC250SX was {{the first}} sport utility ATV. It {{featured}} a 250 cc air-cooled four-stroke engine that like the later revised Big Reds, were shaft propeller instead of chain. It featured larger <b>balloon</b> <b>tires</b> and a sportier look than the similar Big Reds, but could be ordered with cargo racks if the buyer chose to.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the curtain}} finally fell, {{there were five}} cars {{available}} for 1925. <b>Balloon</b> <b>tires</b> (34" [...] × 7.3") were now standard equipment, and the cars got new two-piece rear bumpers, so-called [...] "bumperettes". Although Joseph Cole began liquidating his firm early in 1925, 607 cars left the factory. He died suddenly of an infection on August 8, 1925, shortly before liquidation was finished.|$|R
50|$|A {{custom-built}} recumbent trike {{called the}} Polar Cycle made by Inspired Cycle Engineering (ICE) helped Maria secure her record, while her rivals chose the standard upright bike and took almost 4 weeks longer than Leijerstam {{to reach the}} summit. The 4.5 inch wide <b>balloon</b> <b>tires,</b> a modified gear shift and mounted skids under the front wheels allowed Maria to pass through snowdrifts and climb steep inclines with ease.|$|R
50|$|The {{gasoline-powered}} bus {{was invented}} in Germany in 1895 and motorized buses were introduced in New York City in 1905. As improvements, such as <b>balloon</b> <b>tires,</b> were made, buses became more popular. The first formal bus company in Washington, the Washington Rapid Transit Company, was incorporated on January 20, 1921. By 1932 it was carrying 4.5% of transit customers. Two years later, the last streetcar line was built.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} bolted-together aluminum tubing, covered in Dacron sailcloth. Its 30 ft span wing has flaps and is supported by parallel lift struts and jury struts. The airframe was proof tested to +9/-6g ultimate load. The conventional landing gear features <b>balloon</b> <b>tires</b> and a steerable tailwheel. The standard powerplant supplied by the factory was the [...] Rotax 447, single ignition, two cylinder, two-stroke aircraft engine.|$|R
50|$|Honda {{introduced}} {{their first}} sit-on straddle-ridden three-wheeled ATVs in 1969, which were famously {{portrayed in the}} James Bond movie, Diamonds Are Forever and other TV shows such as Magnum, P.I. and Hart to Hart. Dubbed the US90 and later—when Honda acquired the trademark on the term—the ATC90 (All Terrain Cycle), it was designed purely for recreational use. Clearly influenced by earlier ATVs, it featured large <b>balloon</b> <b>tires</b> instead of a mechanical suspension.|$|R
40|$|The Beach Wheelchair, Sandcrawler, is {{a machine}} {{intended}} to help give people with disabilities the full beach experience.
