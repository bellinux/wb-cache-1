40|$|Abstract: Nowadays, {{public concern}} over food safety, {{especially}} the potential health risk to humans cause {{by the high}} levels of pesticide residues, has increased. In general, people usually refrigerate fresh vegetable in order to keep their freshness intact for longer duration of time. Very few research studies have investigated the correlation between refrigerated vegetables and degradation of pesticide residue. Gas chromatography was used to conduct dynamic analysis of pesticide degradation in off-season vegetables, which are kept in cold storage conditions. Cowpea and <b>balsam</b> <b>pear</b> samples were extracted with acetonitrile. The resultant extracts were purified in SPE column filled with cleanert pesticarb. Thereafter, the eluant extracts were determined through gas chromatography coupled with µECD. Matrix-matched calibrations were analyzed through GC-ECD, where in the limits of quantification varied between 0. 0005 and 0. 0026 mg/kg. The linear coefficients of correlation varied between 0. 9916 and 0. 9997. Recoveries on cowpea and <b>balsam</b> <b>pear</b> were in the range 74. 7 %~ 98. 8 %. Based on the residue dynamics study, the half-lives of the five pesticides in cowpea were as follows: chlorpyrifos: 247 d, chlorfenapyr: 407 d, bifenthrin: 462 d, cyhalothrin: 346 d, and cis-cypermethrin: 315 d. In <b>balsam</b> <b>pear</b> samples, the half-lives of the five pesticides were as follows:chlorpyrifos: 150 d, chlorfenapyr: 187 d, bifenthrin: 433 d, cyhalothrin: 266 d, and cis-cypermethrin: 210 d. The residue of five pesticides in cowpea and <b>balsam</b> <b>pear</b> underwent slow degradation in cold storage conditions. In this study, the findings serve as important reference data, which can be used by the concerned state authorities in formulating the limit of pesticide residue in food...|$|E

40|$|We have {{recently}} described {{the presence of}} a guanylate cyclase [GTP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4. 6. 1. 2] inhibitor (GCI) in an aqueous extract of the <b>balsam</b> <b>pear</b> (Momordica charantia abbreviata). Because the guanylate cyclase-cyclic GMP system is though to be involved in cell growth, DNA and RNA synthesis, and possible malignant transformation, we examined the effect of the aqueous extract containing GCI on an undifferentiated adenocarcinoma of the rat prostate and concanavalin-A-stimulated [3 H]thymidine incorporation into cultured splenic lymphocytes, a process thought to be mediated by cyclic GMP. The results demonstrate that the extract of the <b>balsam</b> <b>pear</b> blocks both the growth of the rat prostatic adencarcinoma in vitro and [3 H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. DNA histograms from flow cytometry indicated that the extract containing GCI inhibited in the G 2 + M phase of the cell cycle, a presumed locus of cyclic GMP effects. In addition, guanylate cyclase activity was significantly greater in the tumor than normal prostate tissue and was decreased by the extract containing GCI. Cyclic GMP levels in the tumor in culture wer also decreased by addition of the extract. It remains to be determined whether or not the anti-tumor agent and GCI are the same substance...|$|E

40|$|The {{inheritance}} of sex expression in cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and other cucurbits is well documented; however, the genetics of female sex (gynoecism) expression in bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) {{has not been}} described. Inheri-tance of gynoecism in bitter gourd was studied in a 100 % gynoecious line (Gy 263 B). The F 2 and testcross segregation data revealed that gynoecism in Gy 263 B is {{under the control of}} a single, recessive gene. Following the gene nomenclature of cucurbits, it is proposed that the gene symbol, gy- 1, be assigned for the expression of gynoecism in bitter gourd.

40|$|The {{morphological}} {{characters of}} {{each stage of}} Bactrocera tau (Walker) was described in detail and illustrated by photos in this paper. The developmental time of the immature stage of B. tau reared on muskmelon reduced {{with an increase in}} temperatures at seven constant temperatures of 10, 15, 20, 25, 28, 30 and 35 ℃. In the egg, the developmental time required for 7. 48 days at 10 ℃, and it took only 0. 87 days at 35 ℃. In the larval, the developmental time was 29. 75 days at 10 ℃ and only 8. 23 days were required at 30 ℃. The developmental time in the pupal was 25. 36 days at 15 ℃ and 7. 23 days at 30 ℃. The theoretical low developmental threshold temperature of egg, larval and pupal were 9. 13 ℃, 2. 39 ℃ and 10. 25 ℃, respectively, and the thermal summation were 16. 41, 267. 59 and 142. 15 DD, respectively. At 28 ℃, larvae were successfully reared on the artificial diet which originally prepared for B. cucurbitae and there was not significantly different for the immature stage, longevity of adults and fecundity of females between those fed on <b>balsam</b> <b>pear,</b> muskmelon and sponge gourd, except the pupa duration. The population parameter under different food showed that both the intrinsic rate of increase (r) and the finite rate of increase (λ) were between those reared on muskmelon (r = 0. 1150, λ = 1. 1218) and <b>balsam</b> <b>pear</b> (r = 0. 0924, λ = 1. 0968). The net reproductive value (R 0) was between those reared on artificial diet (R 0 = 219. 84) and <b>balsam</b> <b>pear</b> (R 0 = 57. 87). The mean generation time (GT) was between 43. 93 days on <b>balsam</b> <b>pear</b> and 52. 34 days on artificial diet. Adults mate from the dusk immediately after sunset to the next dawn, with a mating peak at 21 : 00. The mating duration for each pair of adults averaged 7. 3 to 12. 1 hours. The oviposition of females started from 11 th day after emerged, and reached an oviposition peak at the age of 21 to 35 days old, among them a highest fecundity of 20. 45 eggs/ ♀/ day appeared at 27 days old. There were two peaks of oviposition time for females in a day, the midmorning from early morning to noon and the dusk immediately before dark. The females preferred to oviposit on the pickling cucumber compared with the other host fruits. During summer of 1999, the adults ratio of B. tau and B. cucurbitae emerge from the damaged sponge gourds were investigated. Among them the highest ratio for B. tau was 47. 37 % and the lowest was only 5. 83 % and the mean ratio of B. tau in total samples of both flies was 27. 14 %. The ratio of samples that damaged by both B. tau and B. cucurbitae was 48. 86 ~ 60. 00 % out of the total injured fruit samples. From June 1999 to April 2000, the population fluctuations of B. tau both in bamboo and sponge gourd field were investigated weekly by using cuelure traps. It was found that the population of B. tau occurred in both fields throughout the year and reached the peak of population density from June to August. Then population density declined in the cold season of November to next March. The population density in bamboo field was higher than that in sponge gourd field. The major factor affecting the population fluctuation of B. tau was the adult number of B. cucurbitae in bamboo field and rainfall in sponge gourd field, respectively. 南瓜實蠅（Bactrocera tau (Walker) ）各蟲期之形態特徵在文中有詳細描述。不同定溫下南瓜實蠅在洋香瓜上幼期發育所需時間隨溫度上升而縮短，卵於 10 ℃下需時 7. 48 天，而 35 ℃下僅需 0. 87 天，幼蟲於 10 ℃下需時 29. 75 天、 30 ℃下僅需 8. 23 天，蛹於 15 ℃下需時 25. 36 天、 30 ℃下僅需 7. 23 天。卵、幼蟲及蛹之發育臨界低溫分別為 9. 13 ℃、 2. 39 ℃及 10. 25 ℃，有效積溫分別為 16. 41 、 267. 59 及 142. 15 DD。於 28 ℃下，幼蟲以瓜實蠅之人工飼料飼育可順利完成發育，且與苦瓜、洋香瓜及絲瓜三種瓜實飼育者相比較時，除蛹期有明顯差異外，整個幼期、雌雄蟲壽命及產卵量間均無顯著差異。不同食物飼育下之族群介量，內在增殖率（r）及終極增殖率（λ）均介於以洋香瓜飼育者（r = 0. 1150 /天，λ = 1. 1218 /天）和以苦瓜飼育者（r = 0. 0924 /天，λ = 1. 0968 /天）之間；淨增殖率（R 0 ）介於以人工飼料飼育者（R 0 = 219. 84 ）和以苦瓜飼育者（R 0 = 57. 87 ）之間；平均世代時間介於以苦瓜飼育者之 43. 93 天和以人工飼料飼育者之 52. 34 天之間。成蟲之交尾均於黃昏之後至翌日清晨之前進行，而於 21 : 00 時達到交尾高峰。平均每對成蟲交尾時間為 584. 59 ± 143. 46 分鐘（ 9. 7 ± 2. 4 小時）。成蟲之產卵前期為羽化後 11 日，第 11 日齡開始產卵而於 21 ~ 35 日齡間達到產卵高峰期，其中以 27 日齡時每隻產 20. 45 粒為最高。日產卵高峰多集中在清晨至中午之間之上午時刻及傍晚天黑之前的黃昏時分，形成兩個高峰。對不同瓜實之產卵偏好性，雌蟲偏好在小黃瓜上產卵，次之為南瓜。 1999 年 7 月及 8 月間調查田間之被害瓜實中南瓜實蠅及瓜實蠅（Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett) ）發生之比例，南瓜實蠅成蟲出現最多時為 477 隻，佔取樣中二者總數之 47. 37 %，而最少時為 34 隻佔全部總數之 5. 83 %，在所有調查所得成蟲數總和中南瓜實蠅所佔比例平均為 27. 14 %，而同時有兩種共同為害的樣本佔全部取樣數的 48. 86 %~ 60. 00 %。 1999 年 6 月至 2000 年 4 月間利用克蠅（cuelure）每週於中興新村調查竹林及絲瓜園中成蟲之族群變動情形，在田間全年均可發現南瓜實蠅，其族群數量隨季節而變動，族群密度高峰出現在 6 月至 8 月間，而於 11 月至次年 3 月間密度較低。竹林中之南瓜實蠅族群數量較絲瓜園中為高。而南瓜實蠅在竹林之族群變動主要受瓜實蠅數量影響（R 2 = 0. 5698 ，p = 0. 0013 ），絲瓜園之族群變動則主要受降雨量的正影響（R 2 = 0. 2486 ，p = 0. 0252 ）。摘 要 1 Abstract 3 前 言 5 往昔研究 7 一、南瓜實蠅之形態、分布及寄主植物 7 二、溫度對果實蠅發育之影響 8 三、食物對果實蠅族群介量之影響 9 四、果實蠅行為之研究 10 五、果實蠅田間族群變動之研究 14 材料與方法 16 一、供試蟲源及其飼育 16 二、各蟲期之形態 17 三、不同定溫下幼期各蟲期之發育時間及其成蟲壽命 17 四、不同寄主瓜實及人工飼料下各蟲期之發育、成蟲之壽命、產卵量及其族群介量 18 五、交尾行為及交尾時刻之觀察 20 六、雌蟲產卵期及日產卵高峰及其產卵偏好性 20 七、田間族群調查 22 結 果 23 一、南瓜實蠅各蟲期之形態 23 二、不同定溫下幼蟲各蟲期之發育時間及成蟲壽命 26 三、不同寄主瓜實及人工飼料飼育下南瓜實蠅之族群介量 27 四、交尾習性之觀察 30 五、雌蟲產卵習性之觀察 32 六、田間族群調查 34 討 論 37 一、不同定溫下幼期各蟲期之發育時間及成蟲壽命 37 二、不同寄主瓜實及人工飼料下各蟲期之發育、成蟲壽命、產卵量及其族群介量 39 三、交尾習性之觀察 41 四、產卵習性之觀察 43 五、田間族群調查 45 參考文獻 48 表 57 圖 68 附錄 7...|$|E

It is cultivated from {{different parts of the world}} and is usually used in traditional medicine. This study was conducted to investigate the acute oral toxicity effects of Momordica charantia in Sprague Dawley rats based on OECD Guidelines 423. The extract was administered orally at two different doses of 300 mg/kg and 2000 mg/kg of body weight. The toxicity signs were recorded within the first 24 hours after forced feeding. Both of the treated groups showed dizziness and depression during the first 30 minutes. However, no significant difference of feeding patterns which included water, food intake and body weight gain were observed. Haematological evaluations did not show significant differences in white blood cells count (WBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) levels. However, red blood cells count (RBC) and packed cell volume (PCV) percentage was significantly lower in rats that received 2000 mg/kg than those of the other two groups. Meanwhile, haemoglobin (Hb) count and the relative liver weight of rats received 2000 mg/kg body weight of extract decreased significantly (p< 0. 05) as compared with the control group.
