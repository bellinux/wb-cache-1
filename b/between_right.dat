25|$|The {{prosecution}} {{rejected the}} defense's argument that Dahmer was insane. Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Phillip Resnick testified that Dahmer {{did not suffer}} from primary necrophilia because he preferred live sexual partners as evidenced by his efforts to create unresistant, submissive sexual partners devoid of rational thought and to whose needs {{he did not have}} to cater. Another prosecution expert to testify, Dr. Fred Fosdel, testified to his belief that Dahmer was without mental disease or defect at the time he committed the murders. He described Dahmer as a calculating and cunning individual, able to differentiate <b>between</b> <b>right</b> and wrong, with the ability to control his actions. Although Fosdel did state his belief that Dahmer suffered from paraphilia, his conclusion was that Dahmer was not a sadist.|$|E
25|$|In October 1938, Straffen was {{referred}} to a child guidance clinic for stealing and truancy.

His probation officer found that Straffen {{did not understand the}} difference <b>between</b> <b>right</b> and wrong, or the meaning of probation. The family was living in crowded lodgings at the time, and Straffen's mother had no time to help, so the probation officer took the boy to a psychiatrist. As a result, Straffen was certified as a mental defective under the Mental Deficiency Act 1927. A report was compiled on him in 1940 which gave his Intelligence Quotient as 58 and placed his mental age at six. From June 1940, the local council sent him to a residential school for mentally defective children, St Joseph's School in Sambourne.|$|E
25|$|The Sitaras Method {{consists}} in an initial comprehensive evaluation system (which can take between 6-12 sessions) for assessing flexibility, cardio-respiratory fitness, strength, endurance, and body fat. Sitaras {{takes into account}} the unique musculature of the person, isolating differences <b>between</b> <b>right</b> and left sides of the body, different parts of each muscle, and the two major muscle fiber types (those for strength, and those for endurance), in order to design a workout tailored to each student's genetic aptitude, level of fitness, health conditions, and goals. An important goal is to develop muscular balance, which is the foundation for more specific goals such as aesthetics, strength and flexibility gains, or developing a more powerful athletic ability. The students must commit to working out at least twice a week, and are subject to a background check. They resume the muscle evaluation every three months with a variety of tools including digital scales, body fat and flexibility readers, and proprietary fitness software that helps track the clients strength gains over time. Based on the muscle evaluation, the fitness programs are adjusted or redesigned. The trainees too can follow the detailed physical changes of their body, giving them motivation and stimulation.|$|E

Developing a nested logit model and employing a new, internationally unique, dataset (the population of SEOs by Swedish public firms, 1986 - 1999), we find strong evidence supporting three explanations for the choice <b>between</b> <b>rights</b> offerings and private placements: (i) Firms controlled by large family owners choose uninsured rights offerings to avoid control threats. (ii) Private placements and, to a lesser degree, underwritten rights offerings are chosen by potentially undervalued firms to reduce adverse selection costs.

25|$|Just {{prior to}} the Canucks' 23-man roster being set {{following}} the end of preseason, they claimed defenceman Ryan Stanton off waivers. Stanton had played only one NHL game but was brought in as a possible replacement for Alberts in order to keep a balance <b>between</b> <b>right</b> and left handed defencemen. The youth movement failed to take hold. Guance was sent back to the Belleville Bulls. Despite having a good camp, he was outplayed by fellow prospects, Horvat and Shinkaruk. Tortorella felt Gaunce needed to improve the tempo and the pace of his game and he would benefit from playing more minutes. Due to the injuries and suspensions, it appeared that Horvat and Shinkaruk would start the season with the Canucks. However, just days before the roster was set, Vancouver acquired forwards Zac Dalpe and Jeremy Welsh from the Carolina Hurricanes. Following the trade Horvat was sent back to the London Knights, Shinkaruk remained with the team, but was returned to the Medicine Hat Tigers to make room for Stanton. As {{with the rest of the}} prospects, Vancouver was pleased with their play, but wanted to do what was best for their development. Helping to make the decision to return the prospects to their junior teams was the emergence of Mike Santorelli who had a strong camp, where he was one of Vancouver's best forwards. He earned Tortorella's trust and was played in all situations helping him to make the team.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} January 5, 1998. Filming {{was scheduled to}} begin in Delano, Minnesota, but due to climatic changes {{as the result of}} El Niño, the production was forced to temporarily relocate to northern Wisconsin to find the snow levels described in the script. The production began shooting in Ashland and Saxon, Wisconsin, where most of the film's exterior shots, and the road and woods near where the characters find the plane, were filmed. An actual plane, with one side cut open, was one of two planes used to depict the crashed aircraft. Patrizia Von Brandenstein was the film's production designer, marking her second collaboration with Raimi, after The Quick and the Dead (1995). Brandenstein found the weather conditions difficult during production, as she had to await good weather to complete the necessary exterior work. Describing the overall look of the film, she said, [...] "We created a muted black-and-white color scheme to suggest a morality tale, the choices given <b>between</b> <b>right</b> and wrong." ...|$|E

Bell also explains that Elle {{is one of the few}} characters with abilities that embrace their power and is almost on the verge of being addicted to her ability. Elle [...] "enjoys the emotional power it gives her over other people". She is described as one who is [...] "always out to get what she wants" [...] and someone who [...] "doesn’t have many boundaries".

500|$|The film takes a modern, liberal {{approach}} to the rules and constraints of Catholicism. Even before Father John decides to help Linda, he is questioning the constraints of his religion and calling. While speaking to a prospective mother struggling over whether to raise her daughter within the strict confines of Catholicism, Father John gives her advice beyond the official dogma and encourages her to be flexible, telling her she should [...] "take what works" [...] from the church teachings. Father John also has an unorthodox view of homosexuality compared to the normal views of the church. This is demonstrated in {{a scene in which}} the priest comforts a young man who is struggling with his homosexual feelings. In meeting and interacting with the pimps and prostitutes of the red-light district, Into Temptation blurs the lines between good and evil, and <b>between</b> <b>right</b> and wrong. The negative responses Father John encounters from congregants and the church regarding his trips to the red-light district demonstrate the way sex and poverty are often stigmatized in society.|$|E
