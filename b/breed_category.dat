Live weight (LW) and body condition score (BCS) were recorded on cows entering an Irish commercial slaughter facility between September and November, 2005. Data pertaining to sire breed, age and carcass characteristics were collected and subsequently collated for each cow. For analysis, cows (n = 2163) were subdivided into three breed categories: dairy breed sired by Holstein/ Friesian (FR), sired by early-maturing beef breeds (EM) and sired by late-maturing beef breeds (LM). The proportion of cows slaughtered at the desired (TARGET) carcass standard (cold carcass weight ≥ 272 kg, carcass conformation class ≥ P+ and carcass fat class ≥ 3) was low (on average 0. 30), but did differ (P < 0. 001) between the dairy and beef <b>breed</b> <b>categories</b> (0. 22, 0. 47 and 0. 53 for FR, EM and LM categories, respectively). Regression procedures were used to develop equations to predict cold carcass weight, carcass conformation score, carcass fat score and proportion in the TARGET category from LW and BCS. Equations predicting cold carcass weight had high R 2 values for all <b>breed</b> <b>categories</b> (0. 81, 0. 85 and 0. 79 for the FR, EM and LM, respectively). Equations predicting carcass fatness had moderate R 2 values for the beef <b>breed</b> <b>categories</b> (0. 65 and 0. 59 for the EM and LM, respectively).

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Crossmatings were {{accomplished}} {{among three}} semi-closed lines within {{a population of}} pigs, {{for the purpose of}} investigating effects of crossbreeding on reproductive traits. Two of the lines were purebred (Berkshire and Yorkshire); the third line ("Composite") consisted of descendants from inter se matings among offspring of crosses of the Berkshire and Yorkshire lines. Other crossbred categories consisted of offspring sired by members of the closed lines and farrowed by daughters which had been produced from Berkshire-Yorkshire crossmatings. Reproductive performance was expresses as number of fetuses (dead or alive) per litter. Demonstrations of genetic contrasts among the categories were accomplished by means of electrophoretic analyses of hemolysates and blood serum, and by serology of erythrocytes. Those methods were used to detect phenotypic variations in four serum proteins. two erythrocyte enzymes, and seven antigenic determinants located on the erythrocyte membrane. Among 275 pigs from which specimens were obtained for those analyses, there were dams which had produced a total of 480 litters. A sub-group among the subjects of those studies included 36 families consisting of a mated sow and boar, and one or more offspring of the mating. Inclusion of those families within the population of subjects provided opportunity for some verification of previously proposed modes of inheritance of the blood components. Certain alleles were found to be heterogeneously distributed among the Berkshire, Yorkshire, and Composite lines. Distribution of phenotypes among those categories was such that crossmatings could result in formation of heterozygous combinations of alleles which were found only in the homozygous state in the Berkshire and Composite lines. Distribution of alleles found at one locus was such that crosses of Yorkshires with either Berkshires or Composites could be expected to produce a phenotype which was not present in any of the Berkshire, Yorkshire, or Composite subjects. Those observations provided motivation for accomplishing blood component phenotyping on specimens from daughters produced from various types of crossmatings. Performance data on sows of separate <b>breed</b> <b>categories</b> (crossbred and purebred) were analyzed separately, as seven different subsets of the total performance data. Blood component phenotypes were shown to be associated with variance in reproductive performance, by the method of least squares analysis. Non-genetic variables also considered in these analyses were the age of dam at date of farrowing, and the semester during which conception occurred. Series of least squares analyses were accomplished with data from each of the seven different <b>breed</b> <b>categories.</b> Some evidence was found to suggest an overdominant mode of gene expression in certain <b>breed</b> <b>categories.</b> That mode of gene expression was correlated with the transferrin phenotypes in the Yorkshire and Composite lines, and with the amylose-modifier phenotypes in daughters of the Berkshire-Composite crossmatings. Somewhat less persuasive evidence also suggests an overdominant mode of gene expression correlated with the phosphohexose isomerase phenotypes in another crossbred category. The additive mode of gene expression was associated with transferrin and phosphohexose isomerase phenotypes in daughters from Berkshire-Composite crossmatings. Equally noteworthy results of the study were the consistencies in correlations of certain blood components with performance, without regard to whether gene expression appeared to be additive or non-additive. The evidence indicated high probabilities that transferrin phenotypes were real correlates of performance in three <b>breed</b> <b>categories</b> and that this was also true of amylose-modifier phenotypes in two of the <b>breed</b> <b>categories.</b> There was also fairly persuasive evidence that transferrin and amylose-modifier phenotypes were both real correlates of performance in two other <b>breed</b> <b>categories</b> as well...|$|R

A prospective case-control study of risk factors for laminitis analyzed data of the 258 incident cases seen at six collaborating veterinary teaching hospitals over a 32 -month period. Case-control pairs were matched on institution, clinician, and time of diagnosis. The 90 % of case-control pairs (78 acute, 155 chronic) having complete data for age, gender, and breed were used in separate conditional logistic recession models for acute and chronic laminitis. The odds ratio was calculated for the three upper quartiles of age (referent lowest quartile); for mares and stallions (referent geldings); and for other <b>breed</b> <b>categories</b> (referent the Thoroughbred). Increasing age increased the risk of acute and chronic laminitis nonlinearly. Mares, but not stallions, were more likely than geldings to develop acute laminitis (OR 2. 6. 95 % CI 1. 1 - 6. 2) and chronic laminitis (OR 2. 0, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 3. 6). In the small acute laminitis data set the breed variable was collapsed into three categories, the Thoroughbred (THB), the Quarter Horse (QH), and Other (non-QH-THB). When compared to the referent category THB, the non-QH-THB group, but not the QH was at increased risk of acute laminitis (OR 3. 8, 95 %G 1. 2 - 11. 8). For the seven <b>breed</b> group <b>categories</b> used in the chronic laminitis model, however, all non-THB breeds appeared significantly at risk as compared to the THB, with ads ratios ranging from 3. 3 (95 % (71 1. 3 - 8. 30) for the QR to 9. 1 (95 % CI 2. 1 - 39. 3) for poles. In general, {{the results of this study}} agree with anecdotal evidence and the findings of prior studies, with the exception of no increased risk of laminitis seen in this study for stallions as compared to geldings.

40|$|Data {{from ten}} sources {{comprising}} 3, 851 flocks were modelled to identify variation {{in levels of}} mortality in laying hens. The predicted increase with age was curvilinear with significant variation between the seven <b>breed</b> <b>categories.</b> Mortality was higher in loose housing systems than in cages and variable within system, confirming previous reports. Cumulative mortality (CM) was higher in flocks with intact beaks (χ 2 = 6. 03; df 1; p = 0. 014) than in those with trimmed beaks. Most data were available for free-range systems (2, 823 flocks), where producer recorded CM at 60 - 80 weeks of age averaged 10 % but with a range from 0 % to 69. 3 %. Life cycle assessment showed that {{the main effect of}} increased levels of hen mortality is to increase the relative contribution of breeding overheads, so increasing environmental burdens per unit of production. Reducing CM to levels currently achieved by the 1 st quartile could reduce flock greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 25 %. Concurrently this would enhance hen welfare and better meet the expectation of egg consumers.

40|$|Sexual size {{dimorphism}} (SSD), i. e. {{the difference}} in sizes of males and females, is a key evolutionary feature that is related to ecology, behaviour and life histories of organisms. Although the basic patterns of SSD are well documented for several major taxa, the processes generating SSD are poorly understood. Domesticated animals offer excellent opportunities for testing predictions of functional explanations of SSD theory because domestic stocks were often selected by humans for particular desirable traits. Here, we analyse SSD in 139 breeds of domestic chickens Gallus gallus domesticus and compare them to their wild relatives (pheasants, partridges and grouse; Phasianidae, 53 species). SSD was male-biased in all chicken breeds, because males were 21. 5 +/- 0. 55 % (mean +/- SE) heavier than females. The extent of SSD did not differ among <b>breed</b> <b>categories</b> (cock fighting, ornamental and breeds selected for egg and meat production). SSD of chicken breeds was not different from wild pheasants and allies (23. 5 +/- 3. 43 %), although the wild ancestor of chickens, the red jungle fowl G. gallus, had more extreme SSD (male 68. 8 % heavier) than any domesticated breed. Male mass and female mass exhibited positive allometry among pheasants and allies, consistently with the Rensch's rule reported from various taxa. However, body mass scaled isometrically across chicken breeds. The latter results suggest that sex-specific selection on males vs. females is necessary to generate positive allometry, i. e. the Rensch's rule, in wild populations...|$|R

Our analysis identified that cross-breeds and two <b>breed</b> <b>categories</b> showed high vaccine success rates, while Beagles and Boxers were the least likely to show a successful response to vaccination (88. 82 % and 90. 32 %, respectively). Our analysis revealed diverse performances among the commercially available vaccines, in terms of serological peak windows, and marked differences according to geographical area. Of note, we found a higher vaccine failure rate in imported dogs (13. 15 %) than in those vaccinated in Italy (5. 89 %). Our findings suggest that the choice of vaccine may influence the likelihood of an animal achieving a protective serological level and that time from vaccination to sampling should be considered when interpreting serological results. A higher vaccine failure in imported compared to Italian dogs highlights the key role that border controls still have in assessing the full compliance of pet movements with EU legislation to minimize the risk of rabies being reintroduced into a disease-free area.
