40|$|<b>Bovine</b> <b>papillomatosis</b> is a {{viral disease}} of cattle {{characterized}} clinically by development of multiple benign tumours termed warts. The diagnosis of <b>bovine</b> <b>papillomatosis</b> {{was confirmed by}} clinical and pathological examinations of the warts. The prevalence of <b>bovine</b> <b>papillomatosis</b> in Northern Oases was recorded as 4. 86 %. The prevalence was higher in the females (2. 99 %) than males (1. 87 %). The prevalence was the highest in cattle less than one year old (2. 99 %). The infected cattle were examined visually for detection of external parasites and faecal samples were examined for detection of internal parasites. Infestation with ticks was observed in 10 of the 13 confirmed wart infected animals, while fasciola and parasitic gastroenteritis (PGE) nematode eggs were demonstrated and quantified in 4 and 5 infected bovids respectively. The statistical correlation between the number of warts and Fasciola eggs, and number of parasitic gastroenteritis (PGE) nematode eggs, was 0. 6 and 0. 89 accordingly. Two therapeutic regimes were evaluated, regimen-I and regimen-II. All cattle treated were completely recovered in days post treatment 15 to 115. We concluded that treatment regimen-I was better than regimen-II when taking into consideration the mean days lapsed for healing and regression of warts of 42 days compared to 83 days for regimen-II.

40|$|AbstractThe bovine {{papillomavirus}} (BPV) is the etiological {{agent of}} <b>bovine</b> <b>papillomatosis,</b> which causes significant economic losses to livestock, {{characterized by the}} presence of papillomas that regress spontaneously or persist and progress to malignancy. Currently, there are 13 types of BPVs described in the literature as well as 32 putative new types. This study aimed to isolate viral particles of BPV from skin papillomas, using a novel viral isolation method. The virus types were previously identified with new primers designed. 77 cutaneous papilloma samples of 27 animals, Simmental breed, were surgically removed. The DNA was extracted and subjected to PCR using Delta-Epsilon and Xi primers. The bands were purified and sequenced. The sequences were analyzed using software and compared to the GenBank database, by BLAST tool. The viral typing showed a prevalence of BPV- 2 in 81. 81 % of samples. It was also detected the presence of the putative new virus type BR/UEL 2 in one sample. Virus isolation was performed by ultracentrifugation in a single density of cesium chloride. The method of virus isolation is less laborious than those previously described, allowing the isolation of complete virus particles of BPV- 2...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at the {{molecular}} characterisation of bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV- 1) isolated from papilloma cases in the northwestern region of Turkey. BPV- 1 is a widely occurring oncogenic virus in cattle and is associated with benign epithelial neoplasia which causes significant economic losses in dairy and beef cattle because of treatment costs. In this study, 29 suspected papilloma specimens were collected from cattle in northwestern Turkey. These samples underwent molecular characterisation via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analysis as well as macroscopic and histopathological examination. The histopathological examinations confirmed papilloma as the main lesion type in the specimens. Of the 29 papilloma-like tissue samples that were collected, 11 (i. e. 37. 93 %) were detected as positive and determined as containing BPV- 1 (11 of 11, 100 %). Using a partial sequence for the L 1 gene acquired from GenBank, phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of BPV- 1 and revealed that the infection might have originated in cross bred domestic and imported cattle. This study provides potentially useful information on the origin and spread of this disease. Its results can potentially aid {{in the development of}} appropriate control measures and therapeutic or vaccination strategies against the BPV- 1 strain of <b>bovine</b> <b>papillomatosis...</b>|$|E

40|$|Cutaneous papillomatosis is a {{pathological}} condition {{commonly found in}} cattle and {{is characterized by the}} presence of benign proliferative tumors caused by bovine papillomavirus (BPV) infection. While multiple infections with human papillomavirus (HPV) are common in healthy and immunodeficient humans, studies with the aim of identifying mixed infections are still sporadic in veterinary medicine. The aim {{of this study is to}} describe the occurrence of multiple BPV infections in cattle affected by cutaneous papillomatosis. Fifteen skin warts were collected from at least two diverse anatomical regions of six <b>bovines</b> with <b>papillomatosis</b> belonging to three cattle herds from the Paraná state in Brazil. The BPV types present in the skin wart samples were determined by a PCR assay performed with the FAP primer pair for partial L 1 gene amplification followed by direct sequencing or by cloning and sequencing of the inserts. Sequence analysis of the obtained amplicons allowed the identification of four characterized BPV types (BPV- 1, - 2, - 6, and - 8) and three previously described putative new BPV types (BPV/BR-UEL 3, BPV/BR-UEL 4, and BPV/BR-UEL 5). Double infections were identified in four (A, B, D, and E) of the six animals included in this study. In this work, the strategy adopted to evaluate skin warts from diverse anatomical sites of the same animal allowed the identification of multiple infections with two or three different BPV types. The analysis of four animals belonging to a single cattle herd also showed the presence of six different viral types. These results clearly suggest that both multiple papillomaviral infection and a high viral diversity can be as frequent in cattle as in human beings...|$|R
