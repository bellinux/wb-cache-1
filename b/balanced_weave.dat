Before dying the threads are soaked in a bath of kemiri, candle nut oil, and wood ash to aid the take-up of the red dye, then hung up to dry in the sun. Ramseyer said that the yarn was left to soak for 42 days and then left to dry for the same time. Gillow states that this is {{repeated}} up to 12 times. The threads are wrapped around the dying frame and the pattern is tied into the bundles of thread to form a resist. The bound warp and weft threads are then sent out to the neighboring village of Bug-Bug to be dyed as indigo is forbidden {{to be used in}} Tenganan. [...] Once dyed indigo, the threads are put back on the frames and some of the ties are undone to allow the red component of the pattern to be developed. The indigo is also over-dyed by the red to give the characteristic dark rust-brown color.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the investigation and}} development of damage modelling techniques for woven long glass fibre reinforced polypropylene matrix composites. The objective of the work was to develop and validate predictive models for the intralaminar damage behaviour of these materials, {{with the aim of}} applying the results to an industrial demonstrator component. Two damage modelling methods were investigated. The first, based on ply-level failure criteria and implemented in an implicit finite element code, was developed and validated using a range of coupon tests for a <b>balanced</b> <b>weave</b> 60 % weight fraction commingled glass/polypropylene composite. The second method utilised a model previously implemented in the commercial explicit finite element code, PAMCRASH. This model was calibrated and validated using the same coupon tests as the first model. The models were subsequently used to simulate an industrial demonstrator component, during a two-phase design and development programme. The demonstrator, an automotive side intrusion beam, was designed and predictively modelled using the two damage modelling techniques investigated. Finally, the composite component was compared to a steel side intrusion beam, using a quasi-static vehicle test to a current legislative standard. This test showed comparable performance in terms of strength and stiffness for the two beams. It was concluded that the implicit finite element damage modelling technique can account for the damage and failure modes observed in a woven glass fibre reinforced polypropylene composite, but is limited when considering high levels of material nonlinearity and damage development, due to the stability of the implicit finite element method. It was also concluded that the explicit finite element technique was more suited to the simulation of damage development in thermoplastic matrix composite components, although the research showed that the model investigated was limited when considering shear damaging behaviour in a woven fibre reinforced composite.

40|$|The tensile, {{ballistic}} and puncture {{impact behavior}} of woven fabric {{have been subject}} of interests for many researchers. The tensile behavior of woven fabric can be analyzed from the experimental and analytical methodologies. While experiment provides accurate information about woven fabric’s mechanical properties than the analytical approach, it also generates sample wastage. Finite element analysis (FEA) method is used to model uniaxial tensile, impact and puncture response of woven fabrics in two and three dimensional geometrical model shapes. Woven fabrics models sizes are based on either unit cell or meso-scale (large scale) approach. Nevertheless, limited publications address woven fabric models in terms of weave repeat sizes. Finite element analysis {{has the ability to}} represent fabric geometrical properties and their symmetries, with weave mesh structures able to be made as close as possible, with minimal assumptions. Other than ballistic impact performance, limited work is done to model tensile performance of aramid based woven fabrics. In addition to that, many publications neglect the weaves structures influences such as float and yam crimp to tensile and puncture impact behavior. Hence, in the study, an alternative simulation procedure was proposed to develop the understanding and prediction of float and yam crimp relationship in uniaxial tensile and puncture impact behavior of isotropic weave repeat unit. Woven fabric geometrical models were developed with TexGen and Abaqus CAD pre-processor module. The study was divided into three critical stages. Initially, FEA models were established on plain 1 / 1, 2 / 2 twill and 8 ends satin. Woven fabrics were configured as a <b>balanced</b> <b>weave</b> thereby allowing systematic investigation o f the effect of uniaxial tensile stress on the weave. Woven fabrics were designed to have equivalent densities 8 yams cm' 1 for all three weaves. Equivalent woven fabric specifications were manufactured and tested. Stress-strain validation between experimental and simulation results were made. Next, puncture impact models were developed based on the validated uniaxial tensile simulation models framework and its selected assumptions. Woven fabric for puncture simulation was expanded to consider larger model size than the previous uniaxial tensile model. Here, puncture model analysis was developed with 7 ends and picks cm with a total of 112 yams in both directions. Similar in uniaxial tensile approach, validation analysis was made between puncture model and experimental stress-strain result. Parameters studies were executed on the validated puncture models. The effects of yam frictions and impactor shapes to puncture models stress-strain, post-impact kinetic energy and damage evolution were analyzed. The stress-strain behavior of woven fabrics was found to be related to woven fabric structures. In uniaxial tensile validation, the presence of float in woven fabrics had contributed to stronger square woven fabrics in both warp and weft directions. The apparent gap was more pronounced in puncture model validation than uniaxial tensile model validation. The parameters studies results had shown that flat impactor shape and tightest yam to yam frictions contributed to highest stress-strain, post-impact kinetic energy and damage evolution results. Both uniaxial tensile strength and puncture impact present analogous non-linearity behavior in stress-strain result, which indicated the crimp interchange and yam extension presence in the analysis...|$|E

40|$|The term sashiko {{refers to}} the {{stitching}} {{of one or more}} layers of cloth with a simple running stitch and can also apply to the completed fabric. Sashiko is the noun of the verb sasu, meaning to pierce. Sashiko probably was initially a way to recycle or extend the life of cloth. Among the textiles in the Shoso-in, the Imperial Repository built circa 752 to preserve thousands of objects of art and other belongings of the Emperor Shomu, is an 8 th Century 2 ̆ 2 distant mountain 2 ̆ 2 pattern monk 2 ̆ 7 s robe covered with a purple silk running stitch. This running stitch is superfluous to the actual structure of the robe. This is a development of an earlier ritual robe, evolved {{to the point where the}} stitches have lost their original function to strengthen and attach the patches of cloth, but retained to give the appearance of the original 2 ̆ 2 robe of rags. 2 ̆ 2 This is the oldest example of sashiko extant in Japan. There is a gap in recorded history from this point until the 17 th Century when other sashiko are mentioned. Sashiko was done throughout Japan, primarily by women. It is not known to have been done commercially with the possible exception of some of the firemen clothing. Often it was done by and for people who were too poor to buy new cloth. Sashiko developed from necessity rather than as a luxury, so the art of sashiko wasn 2 ̆ 7 t highly competitive, with some exceptions. That is, the product was not regarded as a statement of fashion. Originally a practical technique for making cloth thicker, warmer, and more durable, sashiko can also be purely decorative. Clothing that has been over stitched is not only very strong, but warm. Therefore, it was reasonable to reinforce the cloth by stitching before the cloth wore out. Presently it is done on new cloth, for garments and textiles to be sold in folk craft shops. Typically, sashiko stitching is done with white cotton thread on an indigo-dyed fabric. Most sashiko uses one strand of thread through the needle, doubled so that both strands account for the stitch although it can be done with a single strand. The length of the stitch varies with the number of layers being stitched together. Keeping the stitches even in length, as well as straight, requires skill and practise. There are approximately five to ten stitches per inch (five to ten stitches per 2. 5 cm.) with certain districts noted for having particularly fine stitching. Sashiko was done on <b>balanced</b> <b>weave</b> textiles, that is the warp and weft are the same thickness and weight of thread. Although the ground fabric threads were not usually counted, the stitches were. Within a pattern, per line, the same number and length of stitch is held constant and is consistent (from point A to B are always x number of stitches and the length of each stitch is held constant). Many patterns consist of straight lines that intersect at right angles, so counting the stitches made the patterns quite exact. At the point of intersection either the stitching threads cross creating a pattern, or the absence of the threads create a pattern such as a star or the center of a flower. Sashiko can be either a single repeating pattern or a combination of several patterns on one fabric...|$|E

50|$|A simple loom {{which has}} its roots in ancient civilizations {{consists}} of two sticks or bars between which the warps are stretched. One bar is attached to a fixed object, and the other to the weaver usually by means of a strap around the back. On traditional looms, the two main sheds are operated by means of a shed roll over which one set of warps pass, and continuous string heddles which encase each of the warps in the other set. The weaver leans back and uses his or her body weight to tension the loom. To open the shed controlled by the string heddles, the weaver relaxes tension on the warps and raises the heddles. The other shed is usually opened by simply drawing the shed roll toward the weaver. Both simple and complex textiles can be woven on this loom. Width is limited to how far the weaver can reach from side to side to pass the shuttle. Warp faced textiles, often decorated with intricate pick-up patterns woven in complementary and supplementary warp techniques are woven by indigenous peoples today around the world.

The 0 deg (loading direction) and 90 deg (perpendicular to loading direction) oriented minicomposites as well as the open porosity and excess SiC associated with CVI SiC composites were all modeled as parallel elements using simple Rule of Mixtures techniques. Excellent agreement for a variety of 2 D woven Hi-Nicalon(TradeMark) fiber-reinforced and Sylramic-iBN reinforced CVI SiC matrix composites that differed in numbers of plies, constituent content, thickness, density, and number of woven tows in either direction (i. e, <b>balanced</b> <b>weaves</b> versus unbalanced weaves) was achieved.
