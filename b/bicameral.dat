5|$|A further {{distinction}} {{is the number}} of chambers in the national legislature; unicameral systems with one chamber or <b>bicameral</b> ones with a lower house and an upper house. Federations and countries with strong regional differences or regional identities are normally <b>bicameral,</b> to reflect the regions' interests in national bills. The states with the larger populations, from the Netherlands upwards, all have a <b>bicameral</b> system. Although there is a greater mix among the smaller states (some influenced by their federalist structure), the smallest states are on the whole unicameral.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990, nine {{parliamentary}} elections {{have been held}} in Croatia. These have included the 1990 elections for a tricameral parliament, three elections of the Chamber of Deputies during the <b>bicameral</b> parliament's existence, three elections of the unicameral Parliament and two elections of the Chamber of Counties—the upper house of the <b>bicameral</b> parliament.|$|E
5|$|Legislative: The <b>bicameral</b> Congress, {{made up of}} the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, {{declares}} war, approves treaties, has {{the power}} of the purse, and has the power of impeachment, by which it can remove sitting members of the government.|$|E
5|$|The Indiana General Assembly is {{the state}} legislature, or {{legislative}} branch, {{of the state of}} Indiana. It is a <b>bicameral</b> legislature that consists of a lower house, the Indiana House of Representatives, and an upper house, the Indiana Senate. The General Assembly meets annually at the Indiana Statehouse in Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|With {{the death}} of Casimir the Great, the period of {{hereditary}} (Piast) monarchy in Poland came to an end. The land owners and nobles did not want a strong monarchy; a constitutional monarchy was established between 1370 and 1493 that included {{the beginning of the}} general sejm, the dominant <b>bicameral</b> parliament of the future.|$|E
5|$|In 1809, {{the makeup}} of the {{legislature}} was altered again by Congress to a <b>bicameral</b> body. A House of Representatives was created and the representation was apportioned by population. The House was then to choose ten candidates from whom the President, through the governor, would choose five to form a council which served as the upper house of the legislature. Thereafter, the structure of the legislature remained unchanged {{for the remainder of the}} territory's existence.|$|E
5|$|Madison's plan {{operated}} on several assumptions {{that were not}} seriously challenged. During the deliberations, few raised serious objections to the planned <b>bicameral</b> congress, nor the separate executive function, nor the separate judicial function. As English law had typically recognized government as having two separate functions, law making embodied in the legislature, and law executing embodied in the king and his courts, {{the division of the}} legislature from the executive and judiciary was a natural and uncontested point.|$|E
5|$|The National Diet is the legislature, {{the organ}} of the Legislative branch. It is <b>bicameral,</b> {{consisting}} of two houses with the House of Councillors being the upper house, and the House of Representatives being the lower house. Its members are directly elected from the people, who {{are the source of}} sovereignty. The Supreme Court and other inferior courts make up the Judicial branch, and they are independent from the executive and the legislative branches.|$|E
5|$|The President {{functions}} as both {{head of state}} and head of government and is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The president is elected by popular vote for a single six-year term, during {{which he or she}} appoints and presides over the cabinet. The <b>bicameral</b> Congress is composed of the Senate, serving as the upper house, with members elected to a six-year term, and the House of Representatives, serving as the lower house, with members elected to a three-year term.|$|E
5|$|The president's {{power is}} checked by a Senate and a House of Representatives, which are {{combined}} in a <b>bicameral</b> body called the National Assembly. The Senate is a 109-seat body with three members from each state {{and one from}} the capital region of Abuja; members are elected by popular vote to four-year terms. The House contains 360 seats, {{with the number of}} seats per state is determined by population.|$|E
5|$|Under the Government of India Act 1935, a <b>bicameral</b> {{legislature}} {{was set up}} with {{a legislative}} assembly consisting of 215 members and a legislative council having 56 members. The first legislative assembly under this act was constituted in July 1937. The legislative council was a permanent body with {{a third of its}} members retiring every three years.|$|E
5|$|By 1809 the territory's {{population}} had climbed to over 20,000. Congress passed legislation {{that allowed the}} Indiana Territory to elect a <b>bicameral</b> legislature and made the Legislative Council the upper house It also ordered Harrison to dissolve the existing one and created the Illinois Territory. The effect of these actions, was to cut the pro-slavery faction remaining in the Indiana Territory in half. The election resulted in a sweeping victory for the anti-slavery party. The new assembly quickly passed legislation revoking the indentured servitude laws of 1803, and introduced legislation to prevent its reintroduction. They also passed laws aimed at preventing slave hunters from removing escaped slaves from the state.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{previously}} held {{office at}} the Old Congress Building. In 1972, due to declaration of martial law, Congress was dissolved; its successor, the unicameral Batasang Pambansa, held {{office at the}} new Batasang Pambansa Complex. When a new constitution restored the <b>bicameral</b> Congress, the House of Representatives stayed at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, while the Senate remained at the Old Congress Building. In May 1997, the Senate transferred to a new building it shares with the Government Service Insurance System at reclaimed land at Pasay. The Supreme Court will also transfer to its new campus at Bonifacio Global City, Taguig in 2019.|$|E
5|$|In 1779, after {{returning}} from France, Adams was also elected to the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention, {{to create a new}} constitution for Massachusetts. Once there, he served on a committee of three, also including Samuel Adams and James Bowdoin, to draft the constitution. The task of writing it fell primarily to John Adams. The resulting Constitution of Massachusetts was approved in 1780. It was the first constitution written by a special committee, then ratified by the people; and was also the first to feature a <b>bicameral</b> legislature. Included were a distinct executive – though restrained by an executive council – with a partial (two-thirds) veto, and a separate judicial branch.|$|E
5|$|Jordan is {{a unitary}} state under a {{constitutional}} monarchy. Jordan's constitution, adopted in 1952 and amended {{a number of}} times since, is the legal framework that governs the monarch, government, <b>bicameral</b> legislature and judiciary. The king retains wide executive and legislative powers from the government and parliament. The king exercises his powers through the government that he appoints for a four-year term, which is responsible before the parliament that is made up of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives. The judiciary is independent according to the constitution.|$|E
5|$|Legislative {{power is}} divided between {{federal and state}} legislatures. The <b>bicameral</b> federal {{parliament}} consists of the lower house, the House of Representatives and the upper house, the Senate. The 222-member House of Representatives is elected for a maximum term of five years from single-member constituencies. All 70 senators sit for three-year terms; 26 are elected by the 13 state assemblies, and the remaining 44 are appointed by the King upon the Prime Minister's recommendation. The parliament follows a multi-party system {{and the government is}} elected through a first-past-the-post system. Since independence Malaysia has been governed by a 13-party coalition known as the Barisan Nasional.|$|E
5|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} has been legally recognized in Maryland since January 1, 2013. In 2012, the state's Democratic representatives, led by Governor Martin O'Malley, began {{a campaign for}} its legalization. After much debate, a law permitting same-sex marriage {{was passed by the}} General Assembly (Maryland's <b>bicameral</b> legislature, composed of the Senate and House of Delegates) in February 2012 and signed on March 1, 2012. The law took effect on January 1, 2013 after 52.4% of voters approved a statewide referendum held on November 6, 2012. The vote was hailed as a watershed moment by gay rights activists and marked the first time marriage rights in the United States have been extended to same-sex couples by popular vote.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} multi-party {{elections}} held {{after the start}} of Communist rule, there have been eight speakers of the parliament; the first five, executing the office until constitutional amendments in March 2001, were also speakers of the Chamber of Deputies (since the parliament was <b>bicameral</b> at the time). As of 28 December 2015, Željko Reiner (HDZ) is the tenth Speaker of the Sabor. There are five deputy speakers in the current parliament: Milijan Brkić (HDZ), Milanka Opačić (SDP), Željko Reiner (HDZ) and Ivan Vrdoljak (HNS).|$|E
5|$|South India elects 132 {{members to}} the Lok Sabha {{accounting}} for roughly one-fourth of the total strength. The region has an allocation of 58 seats in Rajya Sabha out of the total 245. Each state is headed by a Governor, who is a direct appointee of the President of India; the Chief Minister is the elected {{head of the state}} government and represents the ruling party or coalition. Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry follow unicameral legislature while Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana follow <b>bicameral</b> legislature.|$|E
5|$|State legislatures elect {{members for}} terms of five years. States with <b>bicameral</b> legislatures have an upper house (Legislative Council) with members {{not more than}} one-third {{the size of the}} Assembly. Governors may suspend or {{dissolve}} assemblies and can administer when no party is able to form a government. Each state is organised into a number of districts, which are further subdivided into revenue divisions and taluks (or tehsils) for administration. Local bodies govern respective cities, towns and villages with each electing a mayor, municipal chairman and panchayat chairman respectively to head the same.|$|E
5|$|The 14th Parliament of Pakistan is the {{legislature}} of Pakistan following the 2013 general election {{of members of}} parliament (MPs) to the National Assembly of Pakistan, the lower house of the <b>bicameral</b> Majlis-e-Shura. The National Assembly is a democratically elected body consisting of 342 members, who {{are referred to as}} Members of the National Assembly (MNAs), of which 272 are directly elected members; 70 reserved seats for women and religious minorities are allocated to the political parties according to their proportion of the total vote.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Constitution {{adopted in}} 1848 {{is the legal}} {{foundation}} of the modern federal state. It is among the oldest constitutions in the world. A new Constitution was adopted in 1999, but did not introduce notable changes to the federal structure. It outlines basic and political rights of individuals and citizen participation in public affairs, divides the powers between the Confederation and the cantons and defines federal jurisdiction and authority. There are three main governing bodies on the federal level: the <b>bicameral</b> parliament (legislative), the Federal Council (executive) and the Federal Court (judicial).|$|E
5|$|The University of Toronto has {{traditionally}} been a decentralized institution, with governing authority shared among its central administration, academic faculties and colleges. The Governing Council is the unicameral legislative organ of the central administration, overseeing general academic, business and institutional affairs. Before 1971, the university was governed under a <b>bicameral</b> system composed {{of the board of}} governors and the university senate. The chancellor, usually a former governor general, lieutenant governor, premier or diplomat, is the ceremonial head of the university. The president is appointed by the council as the chief executive.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bicameral</b> Texas Legislature {{consists}} of the House of Representatives, with 150 members, and a Senate, with 31 members. The Speaker of the House leads the House, and the lieutenant governor, the Senate. The Legislature meets in regular session biennially for just over 100 days, but the governor can call for special sessions as often as desired (notably, the Legislature cannot call itself into session). The state's fiscal year spans from the previous calendar year's September 1 to the current year's August 31. Thus, the FY 2015 dates from September 1, 2014 through August 31, 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{works in}} concert with the state legislature (the <b>bicameral</b> Indiana General Assembly, consisting of the Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Senate) and the state supreme court (the Supreme Court of Indiana) to govern the state. The governor has the power to veto legislation passed by the General Assembly. If vetoed, a bill is returned to the General Assembly for reconsideration. Unlike other states, most of which require a two-thirds supermajority to override a veto, the Indiana General Assembly may override the veto with an absolute majority vote in both chambers.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Maryland Senate lie in the {{creation}} of an assembly during {{the early days of the}} Maryland colony. This assembly first met in 1637, making it the longest continuously operating legislative body in the United States. Originally, the assembly was unicameral, but in 1650, the Governor and his appointed council began serving as the upper house of a now <b>bicameral</b> legislature. These appointees had close political and economic ties to the proprietors of the Maryland colony, Cecilius Calvert and his descendants. Thus, the upper house in colonial times often disagreed with the lower house, which was elected, tended to be more populist, and pushed for greater legislative power in the colony.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of the premiers of the {{province}} of Quebec, Canada, since Confederation in 1867. Quebec uses a unicameral (originally <b>bicameral)</b> Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the premier {{is the leader of the}} party that controls the most seats in the National Assembly (previously called the Legislative Assembly). The premier, sometimes called the prime minister, is Quebec's head of government, while the Queen of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec. The premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Quebec, and presides over that body.|$|E
5|$|Belgium gained its {{independence}} from the United Netherlands in 1830 and was established as a popular and constitutional monarchy under a <b>bicameral</b> parliamentary democracy. A liberal Constitution was written in 1831 which codified the responsibilities and restrictions imposed on the monarch. Although the King, as head of state, was prevented from acting without the approval of a government minister, he was allowed full control of military matters {{in his capacity as}} Commander-in-Chief. Which responsibility would take precedence if they became incompatible was left ambiguous and this uncertainty would {{lie at the heart of}} the Royal Question. The first king, Leopold I, accepted the terms of the Constitution but attempted to use its ambiguities to subtly increase his own powers. This was continued by his successors, although with little real success.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Randolph {{finished}} {{laying out}} the Virginia Plan, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina presented his own plan to the Convention. As Pinckney did not write it down, the only evidence of the plan are Madison's notes, so the details are somewhat vague. It was a confederation, or treaty, among the thirteen states. There {{was to be a}} <b>bicameral</b> legislature made up of a Senate and a House of Delegates. The House would have one member for every one thousand inhabitants. The House would elect Senators who would serve by rotation for four years and represent one of four regions. Congress would meet in a joint session to elect a President, and would also appoint members of the cabinet. Congress, in joint session, would serve as the court of appeal of last resort in disputes between states. Pinckney did also provide for a supreme Federal Judicial Court. The Pinckney plan was not debated, but it may have been referred to by the Committee of Detail.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{legislative}} body is the National Diet, seated in Chiyoda, Tokyo. The Diet is a <b>bicameral</b> body, comprising the lower House of Representatives with 475 seats, elected by popular vote {{every four years}} or when dissolved; and the upper House of Councillors with 242 seats, whose popularly elected members serve six-year terms. There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age, with a secret ballot for all elected offices. The Diet {{is dominated by the}} social liberal Democratic Party of Japan (DP) and the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The LDP has enjoyed near-continuous electoral success since 1955, except for brief periods between 1993 and 1994 and from 2009 to 2012. As of May 2017, it holds 294 seats in the lower house and 121 seats in the upper house.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette was a {{firm believer}} in a {{constitutional}} monarchy. He believed that traditional and revolutionary ideals could be melded together by having a democratic National Assembly work with a monarch, as France had always had. His close relationships to Americans such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who both happened to be Founding Fathers of the United States, gave Lafayette the ability to witness the implementation of a democratic system in a country. His views on potential government structures for France were directly influenced by the American form of government, which was in turn influenced by the British form of government. For example, Lafayette believed in a <b>bicameral</b> legislature, as the United States had. The Jacobins, however, detested the idea of a monarchy in France; this led to it ultimately being voted against by the National Assembly. This idea only helped lead to his fall from favor, especially when Maximilien Robespierre took power.|$|E
5|$|Legislative: The {{legislature}} of India is the <b>bicameral</b> parliament. It operates under a Westminster-style {{parliamentary system}} and comprises the upper house called the Rajya Sabha ("Council of States") {{and the lower}} called the Lok Sabha ("House of the People"). The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body that has 245 members who serve in staggered six-year terms. Most are elected indirectly {{by the state and}} territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population. All but two of the Lok Sabha's 545 members are directly elected by popular vote; they represent individual constituencies via five-year terms. The remaining two members are nominated by the president from among the Anglo-Indian community, in case the president decides that they are not adequately represented.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, 1846, the Oregon Treaty {{was signed}} with Great Britain, which settled {{the dispute over}} {{sovereignty}} of the Oregon Country. On August 13, 1848 the United States Congress created the Oregon Territory out of the land between California and the 49th parallel (this served as the border with Britain's North American colonies) and west of the Rocky Mountains. A new <b>bicameral</b> territorial legislature was created with an upper chamber Council and lower chamber House. These bodies {{met for the first}} time on July 16, 1849, with some members of the provisional legislature continuing into the new government, including David Hill, Asa Lovejoy, Samuel Parker, and Absalom J. Hembree. Upon statehood in 1859, the territorial legislature would be transformed into the Oregon Legislative Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Public {{access to}} Michigan's {{legislative}} bodies {{is through the}} third floor. The capitol building holds the chambers and offices of the <b>bicameral</b> state legislature, which is composed of the Michigan House of Representatives and Michigan Senate. Public galleries are {{at both ends of}} the third floor. The Senate, with 38 members, has its chambers on the south side of the building, while the House of Representatives, with 110 members, has its chambers in the north wing. House sessions are normally held on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 1:00 PM and Thursdays at 10:30 AM, while Senate sessions begin at 10:00 AM on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Both houses occasionally convene on Mondays and Fridays. Senate and House sessions are taped by Michigan Government Television, a public service body transmitted to local cable television systems' government-access television channels. Similar to C-SPAN, MGTV has made live coverage of the legislative proceedings available since July 15, 1996.|$|E
5|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} has been legal in Spain since 3 July 2005. In 2004, the nation's newly elected Socialist Party (PSOE) Government, led by Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, began {{a campaign for}} its legalization, including the right of adoption by same-sex couples. After much debate, a law permitting same-sex marriage {{was passed by the}} Cortes Generales (Spain's <b>bicameral</b> Parliament, composed of the Senate and the Congress of Deputies) on 30 June 2005 and published on 2 July 2005. The law took effect the next day, making Spain the third country in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry across the entire country, after the Netherlands and Belgium, and 17 days ahead of the right being extended across all of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Since 1971, the {{government}} has functioned under the seventh Constitution of Virginia, which provides for a strong legislature and a unified judicial system. Similar to the federal structure, {{the government}} is divided in three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislature is the General Assembly, a <b>bicameral</b> body whose 100-member House of Delegates and 40-member Senate write the laws for the Commonwealth. The Assembly is stronger than the executive, as it selects judges and justices. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor are elected every four years in separate elections. Incumbent governors cannot run for re-election, however the Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General can, and governors may serve non-consecutive terms. The judicial system, the oldest in America, consists of a hierarchy from the Supreme Court of Virginia and the Court of Appeals of Virginia to the Circuit Courts, the trial courts of general jurisdiction, and the lower General District Courts and Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Courts.|$|E
