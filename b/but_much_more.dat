5|$|In {{contrast}} to early Qenya, the grammar of Quenya {{was influenced by}} Finnish, an agglutinative language, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> by Latin, a synthetic and fusional language, and also Greek, from which he probably took {{the idea of the}} diglossia of Quenya with its highly codified variety: the Parmaquesta, used only in certain situations such as literature. Also the phonology of Quenya was inspired by certain aspects of Finnish, but this is not easily recognised.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow's {{calls are}} chirps {{similar to those}} of the house sparrow, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> musical and mellow. The basic call is used in flight and while {{perching}} socially and transcribed as chissip, chirrup, chreep, or chirrichup. A loud, distinctive call used by the male to advertise nest ownership can be written as tweeng or twileeng; this call can be extended into a jerky and repetitive song, chip cheerup, chip cheerup.|$|E
5|$|The {{season premiere}} was watched by 5.98 million people, {{less than half}} the viewing total for the first season premiere, which was watched by 12.12 million people. The season, which premiered on ABC on September 23, 2014, and ran until May 12, 2015, over 22 episodes, overall had lower <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{consistent}} viewership than the previous season, as well as a much more positive critical response. The series was renewed for a third season on May 7, 2015.|$|E

5|$|Chetro Ketl's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} using three bulk materials: stone, clay-sand, and water. Two types of stone were used: a hard gray-brown tabular sandstone {{that forms the}} bench above Chaco Canyon's cliffs, and a softer, tan, massively bedded sandstone that forms the cliffs themselves. Chacoans preferred the harder, tabular stone as {{it was easier to}} shape, but much of it had to be dug up and levered out of the ground with wooden poles. Because the massive tan stone of the cliff faces was easier to procure, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> difficult to work, the Chacoans probably used it only after the more easily quarried gray-brown stone beds had been depleted.|$|E
5|$|His legend {{had begun}} growing even during his lifetime, as {{he became a}} hero of poems and songs. Few {{negative}} rumors about him, popular {{in the last few}} years of his life, survived after his death. During the period of Enlightenment in Poland he was written about by poets and writers such as Stanisław Potocki, Franciszek Karpiński, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and Franciszek Ksawery Dmowski. A biography by Michał Krajewski cemented his legend of a hero rescuing Poland from anarchy and invasion. That legend that became even stronger during the times of the partitions of Poland in the 19th century, where the artists of the Polish romanticism period used him as a symbol of patriotism, and a reminder of military successes. He appears in the poem Przedświt of Zygmunt Krasiński, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> significant was his portrayal in The Trilogy of Henryk Sienkiewicz, particularly the second book, The Deluge.|$|E
5|$|The {{songs of}} {{mainland}} goldcrests vary only slightly across their range and {{consist of a}} single song type, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> divergence {{has occurred in the}} isolated Macaronesian populations. Not only are there variations between islands and within an island, but individual males on the Azores can have up to three song types. The dialects on the Azores fall into two main groups, neither of which elicited a response from male European goldcrests in playback experiments. There are also two main dialect groups on the Canary islands, a widespread group similar to the European version, and another that is restricted to the mountains of Tenerife. The song variations have been used to investigate the colonisation pattern of the Macaronesian islands by goldcrests, and identified a previously unknown subspecies.|$|E

5|$|Wales has a {{maritime}} climate, {{the predominant}} winds being southwesterlies and westerlies blowing {{in from the}} Atlantic Ocean. This means that the weather in Wales is in general mild, cloudy, wet and windy. The country's wide geographic variations cause localised differences in amounts of sunshine, rainfall and temperature. Rainfall in Wales varies widely, with the highest average annual totals in Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons, and the lowest near the coast and in the east, close to the English border. Throughout Wales, the winter months are significantly wetter than the summer ones. Snow is comparatively rare near sea level in Wales, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> frequent over the hills, and the uplands experience harsher conditions in winter than the more low-lying parts.|$|E
5|$|Weber was {{concerned}} {{with the question of}} objectivity and subjectivity. Weber distinguished social action from social behavior, noting that social action must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another. Study of social action through interpretive means (Verstehen) must be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their actions. Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding (that of the scientist). Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of fool-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited. Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science, but he noted that it is an unreachable goal– although one definitely worth striving for.|$|E

25|$|In 1857 Rudolf Clausius, {{according}} to his own words independently of Krönig, developed a similar, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> sophisticated version of the theory which included translational and contrary to Krönig also rotational and vibrational molecular motions. In this same work he introduced the concept of mean free path of a particle.|$|E

Femoral nerve palsy is another <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> rare complication. Both {{of these will}} typically resolve over time, but the healing process is slow.

25|$|Worries {{about the}} release of this methane and carbon dioxide is linked to arctic shrinkage. Recent years have seen record low Arctic sea ice.

25|$|Hematite is colored {{black to}} steel or silver-gray, brown to reddish brown, or red. It is mined {{as the main}} ore of iron.

Hematite is harder than pure iron, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> brittle. Maghemite is a hematite- and magnetite-related oxide mineral.|$|E
