5|$|Following Syria's independence, the National Bloc was {{dissolved}} {{and replaced}} by the National Party. Quwatli's leadership, while supported by older politicians like Asali, Jabiri and Haffar, became increasingly challenged by emerging leaders such as Nazim al-Qudsi of the People's Party and Akram al-Hawrani of the Arab Socialist Party {{as well as the}} <b>Baath</b> <b>Party,</b> the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP), the Muslim Brotherhood and the Syrian Communist Party (SCP). Antagonistic relations between Quwatli and the Hashemite kings of Iraq and Jordan, Abdullah I and Faisal II, respectively, increased with the latter two seeking to unite Syria, Iraq and Jordan under Hashemite monarchical rule, and Quwatli countering that Iraq and Jordan join a republican Syria under his leadership instead. The Hashemites found support in the People's Party, which became an influential force in Aleppo, a major city and economic hub of Syria, particularly after the 1947 death of Jabiri, Quwatli's Aleppo-based ally.|$|E
25|$|Adib Habb al-Rumman, {{the head}} of Idlib's Jish Shugour's <b>Baath</b> <b>party</b> branch, was assassinated by the FSA, the SOHR reported. The SOHR also made note of {{increased}} political and military assassinations by the FSA in recent weeks.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of oil brought more Christians to Kirkuk, however {{they were also}} affected by the Arabization policy of the <b>Baath</b> <b>Party.</b> Their numbers continued to plummet after the American invasion, and they occupy 4% of municipal offices, a percentage thought to be representative of their numbers in the city. They number around 2,000.|$|E
5000|$|They {{also run}} the Iraqi Solidarity News (Al-Thawra), {{which is the}} online {{magazine}} of the Campaign and is not connected to the Al-Thawra news agency of either the Syrian or Iraqi <b>Baath</b> <b>Parties.</b>|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2000s, Tlass was also deputy prime minister in addition to his post as defense minister. He was also a member of <b>Baath</b> <b>Party's</b> central committee. His other party roles included the head of the party military bureau and chairman of the party military committee.|$|R
50|$|Soon after Feisal's birth, {{his family}} moved back to Baghdad, as the {{situation}} had calmed there. He spent his childhood in the Iraqi capital until 1970, when {{the aftermath of the}} <b>Baath</b> <b>Party's</b> coup two years previously forced his family to move again, this time to Bloomington, Indiana.|$|R
25|$|The Ba'athist {{government}} of Iraq forcibly displaced and culturally Arabized minorities (Kurds, Yezidis, Assyrians, Shabaks, Armenians, Turkmen, Mandeans), {{in line with}} settler colonialist policies, from the 1960s to the early 2000s, in order to shift the demographics of North Iraq towards Arab domination. The <b>Baath</b> <b>party</b> under Saddam Hussein engaged in active expulsion of minorities from the mid-1970s onwards. In 1978 and 1979, 600 Kurdish villages were burned down and around 200,000 Kurds were deported to {{the other parts of}} the country.|$|E
25|$|Ba'athist Arabization {{campaigns in}} North Iraq were forced {{displacement}} and cultural Arabization of minorities (Kurds, Yezidis, Assyrians, Shabaks, Armenians, Turkmen, Mandeans), {{in line with}} settler colonialist policies, led by the Ba'athist government of Iraq from 1960s to early 2000s, in order to shift the demographics of North Iraq towards Arab domination. The <b>Baath</b> <b>party</b> under Saddam Hussein engaged into active expulsion of minorities from the mid-1970s onwards. The campaigns {{took place during the}} Iraqi–Kurdish conflict, being largely motivated by the Kurdish-Arab ethnic and political conflict.|$|E
25|$|The 1950s {{also saw}} Syria and Egypt attempt to unify as the United Arab Republic, {{and this was}} {{reflected}} in the Syrian Air Force with growth in personnel and aircraft. The union did not last. With the ascent to power of the <b>Baath</b> <b>Party</b> and Hafez Al-Assad, himself a former SAF Commander-in-chief, Syria began looking {{to the members of the}} Warsaw Pact for help and built closer ties with the USSR. This in turn led to a huge influx of Eastern-made equipment to the Syrian Armed Forces, including the Air Force.|$|E
50|$|Hussein {{started his}} career in the public sector and worked for a long time there. He also served as an economy {{professor}} at Aleppo University. Then he {{became a member of the}} <b>Baath</b> <b>Party's</b> ruling regional command. In addition, he served as the head of the party's committee of economic affairs. In 2000, he became a member of the party's central committee.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2009, {{the leader}} of the Sunni tribal-based Awakening Movement in Fadhil, Baghdad, was arrested on {{allegations}} of murder, extortion and [...] "violating the Constitution". Adel al-Mashhadani was accused of being the Fadhil leader of the banned <b>Baath</b> <b>Party's</b> military wing. His arrest sparked a two-day gunbattle between Awakening members and Shia-dominated government security forces. In November 2009 he was convicted and sentenced to death for murder and kidnapping.|$|R
5000|$|Zahreddine is from Tarba in the As-Suwayda Governorate. He is {{a member}} of the Druze {{religious}} community. [...] He was commissioned as an officer in the Airborne (Special Forces) Armoured units in 1982. Before that he served in the <b>Baath</b> <b>Party's</b> People's Militia (Popular Militia) as a conscript from 1980 to 1982. In 1987, he was inducted into the Republican Guard as an Armoured and Mechanized Units' officer.|$|R
25|$|Al-Jundi, {{like many}} members of his family, joined the Ba'ath Party early in his youth. In 1960 al-Jundi, then a captain in {{the army of the}} United Arab Republic (UAR), became a {{founding}} member of the secretive Military Committee of the <b>Baath</b> <b>Party.</b> In the beginning, the Military Committee's goal was to rebuild the Ba'ath Party, which had been dissolved on the orders of Gamal Abdel Nasser when the UAR was founded, and establish a new party leadership. Following the Syrian secessionist coup of 1961 that ended the UAR, the Military Committee started planning its own coup against the secessionist government.|$|E
25|$|The Iraqi Islamic Party {{was formed}} in 1960 as the Iraqi branch of the Brotherhood, but was banned from 1961 during the {{nationalist}} rule of Abd al-Karim Qasim. As government repression hardened under the <b>Baath</b> <b>Party</b> from February 1963, the group was forced to continue underground. After {{the fall of the}} Saddam Hussein government in 2003, the Islamic Party has reemerged as one of the main advocates of the country's Sunni community. The Islamic Party has been sharply critical of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, but still participates in the political process nevertheless. Its leader is Iraqi Vice-President Tariq Al-Hashimi.|$|E
25|$|Barzani {{agreed to}} the ceasefire and fired the {{radicals}} from the party. Following the unexpected death of Arif, whereupon he was replaced by his brother, Abdul Rahman Arif, the Iraqi government launched a last-ditch effort to defeat the Kurds. This campaign failed in May 1966, when Barzani forces thoroughly defeated the Iraqi Army at the Battle of Mount Handrin, near Rawandiz. At this battle, {{it was said that}} the Kurds slaughtered an entire brigade. Recognizing the futility of continuing this campaign, Rahamn Arif announced a 12-point peace program in June 1966, which was not implemented due to the overthrow of Rahman Arif in a 1968 coup by the <b>Baath</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1963, Sharaa {{became a}} member of the <b>Baath</b> <b>party’s</b> central committee. Until 1977 he served as the head of the state-run Syrian Arab Airlines in Dubai in the sixties and London. Between 1977 and 1980, he served as Syria's {{ambassador}} to Italy. In 1980 he was named deputy foreign minister. In 1984 Sharaa was appointed acting minister of informations. In March 1984, Hafez al-Assad, then president of Syria, named him foreign minister, a position that he held until February 2006.|$|R
25|$|Following the 1966 coup d'état, Salah Jadid {{became the}} undisputed strongman of the country. He began his rule by re-organizing all the {{intelligence}} agencies under the central command of the <b>Baath</b> <b>Party's</b> National Security Bureau. Jadid appointed al-Jundi, his ally, to head the security bureau, which {{became known as the}} most intimidating apparatus in the country. The bureau, under al-Jundi, acquired a notorious reputation in the country for its brutal methods in rooting out opponents, including arbitrary arrests, torture and infiltrating society with state informers.|$|R
50|$|Yasin was {{appointed}} {{deputy prime minister}} in 1985. Since Abdel Rauf Al Kassem resigned, a new government was formed on 2 November 1987, and Mahmoud Zuabi {{was appointed}} prime minister. Yasin retained his post together with other two deputy prime ministers, namely Mustafa Tlass and Mahmoud Qaddour. Yasin was in office until March 2000 and replaced by Khalid Raad. Then Yasin returned to teaching post at Damascus University. Following the death of Hafez Assad he was made {{a member of the}} <b>Baath</b> <b>Party's</b> regional command in June 2000.|$|R
25|$|In 1973, the Iraqi {{ministry}} of information appointed Bashir to its culture committee; {{the regime of}} the <b>Baath</b> <b>party</b> was not well established {{at that time and}} made Bashir to a cultural figure of integration of the Christian minority. Also because of his international popularity, Bashir, who rather presented himself apolitical, seemed to be a suited personality for representing the different ethnic, religious, and political groups of his home country. In 1981 – Saddam Hussein was already in power and the actual forces passing over to the Sunnites – the regime also supports the formation of Bashir's Iraqi Traditional Music Group that dedicates itself to the diversity of the Iraqi culture.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{has responded to}} the above challenges by banning the drilling of new agricultural wells, promoting water-saving irrigation techniques, rehabilitating the distribution network to reduce leakage, investing heavily in wastewater treatment for reuse, and experimenting with groundwater recharge. However, none of these measures has been successfully completed so far. Reallocation of water from irrigation to urban uses has also been suggested, but {{it has never been}} seriously considered by the government for political reasons, including strong traditional links of the ruling <b>Baath</b> <b>Party</b> to the Peasant's Union. Instead of forcefully promoting local solutions, the government continues to contemplate the large-scale transfer of water from Lake Assad on the Euphrates River through a costly mega-project.|$|E
25|$|This {{position}} {{put him at}} {{odds with}} the country's new democratic government led by Nazim al-Kudsi, and he was a political outcast during those years from 1961 to 1963, when a new coup in March of that year brought to power a more nationalist and unionist wing of the Baath. Jamal's own cousin, the future president Nureddin al-Atassi became Minister of the Interior, and Jamal became Minister of Information in the cabinet of Prime Minister Salah al-Din al-Bitar, {{one of the founders of}} the <b>Baath</b> <b>party.</b> He was also voted into the party's Revolutionary Command Council. A mere four months later Atassi resigned after coming to the realization that restoration of the UAR was not a party priority. He then formed his own party, the Arab Socialist Union, an umbrella group of dedicated unionists who wanted to restore the UAR and reappoint Nasser as president of Syria.|$|E
5000|$|He is {{a member}} of the [...] "dirty dozen", {{allegedly}} responsible for torture and murder in Iraq. Prior to the U.S. invasion in April 2003, Al-Numan was the <b>Baath</b> <b>Party's</b> regional command chair, responsible for West Baghdad. He was previously the governor of Karbala and Najaf. He was taken into custody on May 22, 2003. At the time, he was the Number 8 on the Central Command's list of the 55 most wanted Iraqis, and was the highest-ranking person on the list of 55 to have been taken into custody to that time. He was one of nine Iraqi leaders that the United States wished to see tried for either war crimes or crimes against humanity.|$|R
50|$|Assir's notoriety {{increased}} after {{a series}} of sermons and public exhibitions criticizing Hezbollah, a once untouchable symbol in the Lebanese political landscape. He also caused controversy by openly criticizing figures within the militia such as secretary general and spokesperson Sayed Hassan Nasrallah. Many of his speeches are critical of Hezbollah's, Iran's and the Arab <b>Baath</b> <b>Party's</b> support for Syrian President Bashar Al-Asad. Assir has stated that he is only against Shias that follow the teachings of Khomeini. Assir has attempted to become a leader of the Sunnis of Lebanon, without success. Currently he is not considered a mainstream Sunni Scholar; however, his aggressive and emotional rhetoric against Hezbollah's intervention in Syria has gained him headlines and controversy, along with attracting many supporters and followers disillusioned with the traditionally Sunni Future Movement party and the leadership of Saad Hariri.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the war was}} a {{heavy burden}} on Iran and Iraq politically, economically, and socially, the most {{profound}} consequence of the war's prolongation on Iraq, was {{its impact on the}} patterns of Iraq's foreign relations. Whereas trends toward a moderation of the <b>Baath</b> <b>Party's</b> ideological approach to foreign affairs were evident before 1980, the war helped to accelerate these trends. Two of the most dramatic changes were in Iraq's relationships with the Soviet Union and with the United States. During {{the course of the war}} Iraq moved away from the close friendship with the Soviet Union that had persisted throughout the 1970s, and it initiated a rapprochement with the United States. Iraq also sought to ally itself with Kuwait and with Saudi Arabia, two neighboring countries with which there had been considerable friction during much of the 1970s. The alignment with these countries was accompanied by a more moderate Iraqi approach to other Arab countries, such as Egypt and Jordan, which previously Iraq had perceived as hostile.|$|R
25|$|Al-Douri is {{the most}} {{high-profile}} Ba'athist official to successfully evade capture after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and was the king of clubs in the infamous most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. Al-Douri continued to lead elements of the Iraqi insurgency such as the Naqshbandi Army against the then-occupation forces and waged an insurgency against the current regime in Baghdad. Following the execution of Saddam Hussein on 30 December 2006, al-Douri was confirmed as the new leader of the banned Iraqi Ba'ath Party on 3 January 2007. Al-Douri was reportedly killed in action—along with his nine bodyguards—on 17 April 2015 in a large-scale military operation by Shiite militias and Iraqi forces near the Al-Alaas oil fields in Hemreen east of Tikrit. The Shiite militant organization Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq has alleged to have killed him and transported his apparent body to Baghdad to confirm its identity. According to the BBC, Shiite militias claimed to have killed him, but the Iraqi <b>Baath</b> <b>party</b> denies his death, and his death has not been confirmed. A Kurdish news source also reported that Iraq did not have al-Douri's DNA to confirm his death.|$|E
500|$|While the Syrian {{constitution}} liberally grants free speech, a {{state of}} emergency in effect since the <b>Baath</b> <b>Party</b> seized power suspends this freedom. Syria has stringently approached dissidents who question its policies in neighboring Lebanon; Syrian authorities detained and imprisoned ten activists who signed the Beirut-Damascus Declaration petition in May 2006. The petition, of which al-Mir was a signatory, advocated the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and the normalization of relations between the two countries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{full name}} of the {{government}} is the [...] "Kurdistan Regional Government", abbreviated [...] "KRG". Kurds also refer to the region as Başûrê Kurdistanê or Başûrî Kurdistan ("Southern Kurdistan"), referring to its geographical location within the whole of Kurdistan. During the <b>Baath</b> <b>Party</b> administration in the 1970s and 1980s, the region was called the [...] "Kurdish Autonomous Region".|$|E
50|$|Al-Habib was a {{lecturer}} {{and later a}} faculty member of the Department (Faculty) of Law at the University of Aleppo. He was {{also a member of}} the Legal Office in the University of Aleppo branch of the <b>Baath</b> Arab Socialist <b>Party.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most {{observers}} credited {{land reform}} measures with liquidating concentration of very large estates and weakening {{political power of}} landowners. Some government data of uncertain coverage and reliability indicated that before land reform {{more than half of}} agricultural holdings consisted of one hundred hectares or more, but after reform such large holdings amounted to less than 1 percent. The same data showed that smallholdings (seven hectares or less) had increased from about one-eighth before land reform to just over one-half of total holdings after reform, and that 42 percent of holdings were between eight and twenty-five hectares. Other government statistics indicated that holdings of twenty five hectares or less, representing 30 percent of all land under cultivation before 1959, represented 93 percent in 1975. A May 1980 Order in Council mandated additional expropriations and further reduced the size of agricultural holdings. Data from the 1970 census revealed that the average farm holding was about ten hectares, and that one-fifth of the rural population remained landless. Despite the <b>Baath</b> <b>Party's</b> commitment to land reform, the private sector controlled 74 percent of Syria's arable land in 1984.|$|R
50|$|A {{well-known}} {{example is}} the Arab <b>Baath</b> Socialist <b>Party,</b> established as an Arab nationalist and socialist party aspiring to pan-Arab political union. The party's central governing body, the National Command, included representatives from its organisations in all the Arab countries where Baathists had a significant presence. Each branch of the party, in turn, had a local governing body, the Regional Command, and although practical power became centred in the Syrian and Iraqi Regional Commands and the National Command of each faction assumed an essentially symbolic role, the party split in 1966, with different factions taking control in Syria and Iraq, each faction retained a pan-Arab structure.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the time}} of the 1977 census, Assyrians were being {{incorrectly}} referred to as either Arabs or Kurds. Assyrian Christians were forced to deny their identity as Assyrian nationalism was harshly punished. One example of this [...] "Arabization" [...] program was Iraqi deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, an Assyrian member of the Chaldean Catholic faith who changed his surname from Mikhael Youhana upon joining the <b>Baath</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After the <b>Baath</b> <b>Party</b> {{took control}} in 1968 and {{especially}} after Saddam Hussein seized power in 1979, youth groups were retooled {{to serve the}} state. One replacement program, Saddam Cubs, offered [...] "summer camps" [...] where 10- to 15-year-old boys had up to 14-hour days filled with hand-to-hand fighting drills. In 1990, during the period when the Iraq Boy Scouts and Girl Guides Council was recognized by WOSM, there were 12,000 Scouts, however by 1999, Iraq had been expelled from the WOSM.|$|E
2500|$|Iraq {{charged that}} the {{commission}} was a cover for US espionage and refused UNSCOM access to certain sites, such as <b>Baath</b> <b>Party</b> headquarters. Although Ekéus {{has said that he}} resisted attempts at such espionage, many allegations have since been made against the agency commission under Butler, charges which Butler has denied. Within the UN establishment in Iraq, UNSCOM was not without its critics, with the UN's humanitarian staff informally calling the inspectors 'UN-Scum'. In return, the UN's humanitarian staff were called [...] "bunny-huggers".|$|E
50|$|In {{the period}} of decolonialism {{following}} World War II, Arab nationalism overshadowed Islamism which denounced nationalism as un-Islamic. In the Arab world secular pan-Arab <b>parties</b> - <b>Baath</b> and Nasserist <b>parties</b> - had offshoots in almost every Arab country, and took power in Egypt, Libya, Iraq and Syria. Islamists suffered severe repression; its major thinker Sayyid Qutb, was imprisoned, underwent torture and was later executed.|$|R
5000|$|The coup in 1968 led to {{the rise}} of the Ba’ath Party as it regained control. The coup in 1968 {{led to the}} {{establishment}} of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council which became the ultimate decision-making body in Iraq during the Ba’ath’s rule from 1968 to 2003. Accordingly [...] "under a provisional constitution adopted by the party in 1970, Iraq was confirmed as a republic, with legislative power theoretically vested in an elected legislature but also in the party-run RCC, without whose approval no law could be promulgated." [...] Furthermore, [...] "second to the council in political importance was the Regional Command of the <b>Baath,</b> the <b>party</b> executive, and third was the Council of Ministers." [...] The legislature also included the National Assembly and a 50-member Kurdish Legislative Council.|$|R
5000|$|According {{to foreign}} analysts the Ba'ath Party {{has played a}} minor role in the Syrian Civil War, {{becoming}} more of a symbolic force in the Assad's government fight to stay in power. In areas Ba'ath Party institutions have all but collapsed, the authorities have responded by establishing state institutions to take their place, leaving party cadres in certain places leaderless. [...] According to Souhaïl Belhadj, the author of The Syria of Bashar Al-Asad - Anatomy of an Authoritarian Regime (Belin Publisher: La Syrie de Bashar al-Asad. Anatomie d'un régime authoritaire) [...] "The Regional Command’s loss of influence has spread to lower levels of government as well. Today, apart from the party branch of the security forces, all branches of the Baath, whether at the governorate or district level, are nonoperational. They are {{no longer able to}} lead the political process, report to the Regional Command concerning the situation on the ground, or provide economic and social information. In addition, Regional Command leaders witnessed the alienation, and indeed defection, of branch secretaries—the <b>Baath</b> <b>Party’s</b> most senior representatives in the provinces." [...] Former Ba'ath officials who have defected have claimed that up to half of the 2.5 million members (a figure dating before the Syrian civil war) have left the party. The party's headquarters in Homs and Deraa have been destroyed. While the remnants of the provincial-level tier of the Ba'ath Party structure still remains intact, the district-level has progressively fallen apart, {{and will continue to do}} so. The municipal councils, which are controlled by Ba'ath majority representation, [...] "are in a state of total disarray." [...] To take on example of the party's deterioration, when the Deraa branch asked 3,000-4,000 party cadres to hold a political rally in support of the Assad government, less than 100 people showed up. This resulted in the branch secretary being forced to [...] "hold a modest meeting instead." ...|$|R
