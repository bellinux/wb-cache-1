500|$|Martin {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} fifth win of the season, and his first at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway, in front of 101,000 who attended the race. Martin also earned $232,750 in race winnings. Montoya was somewhat frustrated with the result, saying: [...] "Martin just screwed me -- he just stopped {{the car on the}} apex, right on the bottom, and I had nowhere to go," [...] Montoya said. [...] "I could have pushed him out of the way ... but I respect him a lot." [...] Martin was delighted with his victory: [...] "Alan [...] won the race, Alan's the man. This is a dream come true. ... We still have the lotto at Talladega , and [...] think we'll run OK at Martinsville. We finished [...] in the spring, but I don't run good there -- <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> hardest place. It's a tough place." [...] Martin also argued that his driving did not cause the final caution: [...] " [...] Once you got the lead, you need to make sure you don't drive it in there and turn it sideways (and) slide it up the racetrack. I mean, how stupid would I look then?" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{losing his}} first five games in charge, {{including}} a 7–0 thumping from Grimsby Town at Blundell Park, Gannon {{admitted that the}} club's finances limited his ability to change personnel. He also stated that [...] "if I didn't take the job, this club would've had a real chance of dying... I'm not proud to be {{the manager of a}} club that loses 7–0... <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> team now... It has always been my club, so it's my responsibility to make things better, and over time we will." [...] He released striker Antonio German, defender Chris Blackburn, and seven goal top-scorer Nick Chadwick in the January transfer window. He then signed defender Joe Connor on non-contract terms, and teenagers Aaron Cole and Danny Rowe on loan. His first win in his second spell at the club came on New Year's Day, in a 3–2 victory over Barrow at Edgeley Park. He then re-signed former players Paul Turnbull and Matty Mainwaring on loan. Worried by the situation at crisis clubs Darlington and Kettering Town, Gannon cancelled the contracts of veterans Matt Glennon, John Miles, Mark Lynch, and Ryan McCann. He brought in 23-year-old Telford defender Sean Newton and 18-year-old Sunderland keeper Lewis King on loan, whilst signing 19-year-old Lancaster City midfielder Danny Hattersley on a permanent transfer. The [...] "Hatters" [...] secured their Conference status with two games to spare, after a 1–1 home draw with Braintree Town on 14 April, having lost just twice in the league at Edgeley Park since Gannon's return. Stockport finished the campaign in 16th place, 10 points above the drop and 20 points below the play-off zone.|$|E
60|$|With {{the jewels}} {{he brought me}} I also took the {{precaution}} (<b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> uncle's idea, {{and a very good}} one) to have a sort of invoice, and a letter begging me to receive the trinkets as so much part payment of a sum of money he owed me.|$|R

500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News {{on the set of}} the video shoot, Drake said, [...] "I've shot a lot of videos before, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> first attempt to establish myself as Drake the artist." [...] Confronting the criticism of his past videos, notably the one for [...] "Best I Ever Had", Drake said, [...] "I really don't care what other people think about them, they were great experiences for me. I've learned a lot from them", and he explained that he was working on that day with Mandler, someone he respects and looks up to. On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? Will I ever find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E

I love doing it. Why quit?" [...] During an interview on July 20, 2015, Keillor announced his intent to retire from the show after the 2015–2016 season, saying, [...] "I have {{a lot of other things}} that I want to do. I mean, nobody retires anymore. Writers never retire. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> last season. This tour this summer is the farewell tour." ...|$|E
2500|$|He also {{performed}} in the 2007 WOMAD (World of Music, Arts and Dance) festival concert, and in reviewing his performance BBC Radio referred to his voice as [...] "sensational". D'Or described an experience that he had singing at the festival as follows: [...] "I had a concert in the Canary Islands...in the WOMAD Festival in front of something like 20,000 people, and then I saw {{just in front of}} me, a group of Palestinian young people with a huge Palestinian flag. And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were. I closed my eyes and said 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, and then when I opened my eyes and I saw those people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and it was for me like an amazing sight, because this is something that I don't think ever happened before. I don't know why this world...is choosing...always...war and hate, because things are much easier to solve if you just want to solve them, that's what I feel. And maybe it's naïve, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> belief." ...|$|E
5000|$|My {{mother and}} I started right in on horrendous battles, just horrible battles, violent and vicious. I've {{never been in}} such a vicious verbal battle with anyone.

I entered the table again, according to rule; I entered the table half a dozen times, according to rule, and every time found that my difference of longitude was 25 miles. I leave it to you, gentle reader. Suppose you had sailed 24 miles and that you had covered 3.5 miles of latitude, then {{how could you have}} covered 25 miles of longitude? Even if you had sailed due west 24 miles, and not changed your latitude, how could you have changed your longitude 25 miles?
