5|$|Although The Thrill <b>Book</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{described}} as the first American pulp to specialize in fantasy and science fiction, this description is not supported by recent historians of the field, who regard it instead as a stepping stone on the path that ultimately led to Weird Tales and Amazing Stories, the first true specialized magazines {{in the fields of}} weird fiction and science fiction respectively.|$|E

5|$|Waugh had {{converted}} to Roman Catholicism in 1930, after which his satirical, secular writings drew hostility from some Catholic quarters. He did not introduce overtly religious themes into A Handful of Dust, but later {{explained that he}} intended the book to demonstrate the futility of humanist, as distinct from religious, especially Catholic, values. The <b>book</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> dramatised for radio, stage and screen.|$|E
5|$|Caged Bird was {{nominated}} for a National Book Award in 1970 and remained on The New York Times paperback bestseller list for two years.

However, the book's graphic depiction of childhood rape, racism, and sexuality has caused it to be challenged or banned in some schools and libraries.|$|E
5|$|Even the maps, {{of which}} Tolkien {{originally}} proposed five, were considered and debated. He wished Thror's map to be tipped in (that is, glued {{in after the}} <b>book</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> bound) at first mention in the text, and with the moon-letters (almost identical to Anglo-Saxon runes) on the reverse {{so they could be}} seen when held up to the light. In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, Thror's map, and the Map of Wilderland, both printed in black and red on the paper's cream background.|$|E

5|$|On Bates's {{return to}} England, he was {{encouraged}} by Charles Darwin to write up his eleven-year stay in the Amazon as a book. The result was widely admired, not least by Darwin; other reviewers sometimes disagreed with the book's support for evolution, but generally enjoyed {{his account of the}} journey, scenery, people, and natural history. The <b>book</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> reprinted many times, mostly in Bates's own effective abridgement for the second edition, which omitted the more technical descriptions.|$|E
5|$|On the book's publication, Waugh's friends praised it, but {{its general}} {{critical}} reception was muted. Most reviewers admired the self-portrait of Waugh {{with which the}} novel opens, but expressed divided views about the rest, in particular the ending. Commentators have debated whether the novel provides a real-life depiction of Waugh, or if it represents the exaggerated persona that he cultivated {{as a means of}} preserving his privacy. The <b>book</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> dramatised for radio and as a stage play.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, the <b>book</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> rebound several times. During an 18th-century rebinding, {{the pages}} were rather unsympathetically cropped, with small parts of some {{illustrations}} being lost. The book was also rebound in 1895, but that rebinding broke down quickly. By the late 1920s, several folios had detached completely and were kept {{separate from the}} main volume. In 1953, bookbinder Roger Powell rebound the manuscript in four volumes and stretched several pages that had developed bulges. Two volumes can normally be seen displayed at Trinity, one opened at a major decorated page, and one opened to show two text pages with smaller decorations.|$|E
