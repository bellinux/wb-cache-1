5|$|Basil Mitchell {{responded to}} Flew's falsification {{principle}} {{with his own}} parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> <b>the</b> resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, {{even if he is}} seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} months of winter {{darkness}} Joyce and Wild printed around 30copies of the expedition's book, Aurora Australis, which were sewn and bound using packaging materials. The most important winter's work, however, {{was preparing for}} the following season's major journeys, which were to include attempts on both the South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. By making his base in McMurdo Sound, Shackleton {{had been able to}} reinstate the Magnetic Pole as an expedition objective. Shackleton himself would <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> <b>the</b> South Pole journey, which had suffered a serious setback during the winter when four of the remaining ponies died, mainly from eating volcanic sand for its salt content.|$|E
5|$|Pérez Balladares later {{served as}} {{campaign}} manager for Carlos Duque, Noriega's chosen candidate for the 1989 presidential election. The opposition candidate, Guillermo Endara, was reported by international observers to <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> <b>the</b> vote by a 3-to-1 margin, but the results were annulled by the Noriega government before counting was complete. During the December 1989 US invasion of Panama, however, Endara was certified the election's winner and sworn in as {{the next president of}} Panama. During the invasion, Pérez Balladares was briefly detained and interrogated by US forces for his association with Noriega, but was then released.|$|E

25|$|In March 1882, Captain Henri Rivière again visited Hanoi {{with three}} gunboats and 700 men {{in order to}} obtain a trade agreement. Following some provocations, Rivière {{captured}} Hanoi in April 1882. Again the Black Flags counter-attacked, and Rivière was killed in May 1883 in the Battle of Paper Bridge, leading to a huge movement in favour of a massive armed intervention in France. Credits were voted for, and a large force of 4,000 men and 29 warships (including 4 ironclads) was sent. Admiral Amédée Courbet would <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> <b>the</b> force in Tonkin, while Admiral Meyer would operate in China.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, Featherston drifts for a short while, before joining the newly created Freedom Party. Featherston establishes himself as head propagandist, and eventually becomes its leader, aided by Party member Ferdinand Koenig. With his raw energy and humble origins, Featherston has little trouble whipping up support from much of the Confederate populace, and it seems by the early 1920s that he would surely <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> <b>the</b> country. But with the assassination of President Wade Hampton V in June 1922 by a Party stalwart, the Freedom Party suffers a sudden and near-total collapse as a political force.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, Australia was {{scheduled}} to tour England {{to play for the}} Ashes. Before the squad was selected, Greg Chappell announced that he would not <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> <b>the</b> Australian team, citing business and family reasons. In his absence, the Australian Cricket Board turned to Hughes as captain. The Australian team arrived in England in May and was greeted by rain, leaving them short of needed match practice. Nevertheless, Hughes and his team unexpectedly won the preliminary One Day International series. The first Test was played at Trent Bridge in Nottingham. Australia won the low scoring and rain affected match by six wickets, after Hughes had taken the opportunity to put England into bat after winning the toss. Australia then had the best of a drawn match in the second Test at Lord's. After making a pair in this match, Ian Botham resigned his position as captain of England.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, Valentin Mihov was {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Bulgarian Football Union and Petar Kalpakchiev was chosen to replace him {{at the helm of}} CSKA. However, Kalpakchiev wrangled with the club's administration over their decisions to replace several coaches, one of which was Gjoko Hadžievski, considered to <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> <b>the</b> club in the right direction, and eventually he was fired. The owner of the Multigroup conglomerate, Iliya Pavlov, took over as president, but ultimately his sponsorship proved insufficient to overcome the club's ineffective management. Five coaches were changed in just one season, with Tsvetan Yonchev being coach for just one day. In Europe, CSKA nevertheless defeated Juventus 3–2 {{in the first round of}} the 1994–95 UEFA Cup, but the result was annulled by UEFA because of the delayed player-indexing of forward Petar Mihtarski, and Juventus were awarded a 3–0 victory by default. In the second leg in Turin, CSKA succumbed to a 5–1 defeat.|$|E
25|$|Red Bull Racing {{returned}} {{to have a}} great season in 2010, thanks to their hiring of designer Adrian Newey in 2007. They won the Constructors' Championship in the penultimate round in Brazil, and Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel won the championship in the final round of the 2010 season at Abu Dhabi. Mercedes GP (formerly Brawn GP) had a much less successful and winless season than 2009 with their two new drivers – seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher who {{returned to}} Formula One, but was regularly beaten by fellow German, Nico Rosberg. McLaren and Ferrari had better seasons in 2010, finishing second and third in the constructors, respectively. The Drivers' Championship was very closely fought, with six men leading the championship at one point, in the joint longest ever (nineteen-race) season. For most of the season, the title looked like it could have gone to either Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel or Mark Webber, or either McLaren's Lewis Hamilton or reigning World Champion Jenson Button (also at McLaren). But, the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso clawed back 47-points after the British Grand Prix, to <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> <b>the</b> Drivers' Championship with two races left. A record four drivers were still in contention for the title going into the final round in Abu Dhabi. They were Alonso, Webber, Vettel and Hamilton (placing in that order in number of points before the race). They did not finish that way though, with Vettel winning the race and the title when the others finished too far down the field. Vettel became the youngest ever World Champion {{in the history of the}} sport.|$|E

500|$|Ripken had {{a career}} year in 1991. Through the All-Star break, his batting average was [...]348, making him the first shortstop to <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> <b>the</b> league in average through that point since Lou Boudreau in 1947. He {{finished}} the season by hitting [...]323 with 34 home runs and 114 RBI. In addition, Ripken hit 46 doubles, stole a career-high six bases and was caught once, and hit five triples while posting his career lowest strikeout rate and lowest number of strikeouts in a season with 600 or more plate appearances. He became the first Major League shortstop ever to have 30 home runs and 200 or more hits or 30 home runs and 40 or more doubles.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Cielo {{announced}} {{the creation of}} P.R.O. 16 – the [...] "Going for 2016 Gold" [...] Project. The initiative, designed to serve as Brazilian swimming's [...] "elite squad", gathered Cielo, who would <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> <b>the</b> project, and six other swimmers – André Schultz, Leonardo de Deus, Nicholas Santos, Henrique Rodrigues, Tales Cerdeira and Vinicius Waked – all selected for potential medals in the 2016 Summer Olympics, in Rio de Janeiro. The idea would be to prepare the swimmers also for the main competition in the coming years. For two years, the innovative program, which proposed a system of high level training without relying on the infrastructure of big clubs, worked. But the difficulty of finding sponsors and the change of attitude of the clubs made the training group lose almost all its members. In 2013, Cielo {{was the only one}} left in the project, but highlighted its continuity, with changes in the project, receiving new members and getting new sponsors.|$|E
500|$|Wilkinson {{had formed}} a close {{relationship}} with Morrison, personally and politically, before and during their wartime ministerial association. She thought that he, rather than the sedate Attlee, should <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> <b>the</b> Labour Party, and had promoted his leadership credentials in 1935 and 1939. In 1945, Morrison [...] informed Attlee that he intended to seek the leadership [...] "in the interests of party unity". In the general election held in July 1945 Labour won a landslide victory, with 393 seats against the Conservatives' 213. This did not prevent Wilkinson and others from continuing to press for a change of leader, but Attlee forestalled further action by quickly accepting the king's invitation to form a government. He showed no resentment towards either Morrison or Wilkinson; the former was appointed Lord President of the Council and deputy prime minister, while Wilkinson was made Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet. Emmanuel Shinwell, who became Minister of Fuel and Power, later commented that [...] "it is not bad tactics to make one's enemies one's servants".|$|E

500|$|According to Baley, at {{approximately}} 2 p.m. on August 30, 1858, the emigrants camped near the Colorado River heard Alpha Brown's step-daughter, Sallie Fox, screaming. She {{had been playing}} in a wagon when she noticed several Mohave nearby. Having lost the element of surprise, three hundred warriors then let out war whoops as they shot arrows into the camp, mortally wounding Rose's foreman, Alpha Brown. Udell described the attack as [...] "like a shower" [...] of arrows. According to Rose, [...] "I have no doubt they expected to massacre us. But we were well armed and the men that were in camp ready to receive them." [...] As the men mounted a defense, the women ran with {{their children to the}} covered wagons. Both Udell and Rose stated that the fighting lasted for approximately two hours. Baley explains that when a Mohave chief who appeared to <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> <b>the</b> attack stepped out in front of his warriors and taunted the emigrants, Gillum Baley, a veteran of the Black Hawk War and a noted marksman, took him down with a single rifle shot. The Mohave warriors then retrieved the chief's body and retreated from the battle.|$|E
500|$|American {{intelligence}} analysts had thought General Trần Văn Đôn {{was involved in}} the coup with Phát and Thảo, but altered their assessment when he stayed in the mountain resort town of Da Lat instead of heading for the capital. Their changed assessment was reinforced by the announcement that Khiêm would <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> <b>the</b> replacement government if the coup was successful. Eight months after the coup was over, Đôn told the American historian George McTurnan Kahin [...] that he had been plotting with Thảo, who had planned for him to become Defense Minister and Chief of Staff of the military, but said the Dai Viet and Kiem had insisted on installing the Catholic Khiêm. A month earlier, American {{intelligence analysts}} thought Thảo was planning to replace Khánh as commander-in-chief with Don. Ambassador Khiêm had been putting pressure on his bitter rival Khánh for over two months by charging him and the Buddhists of seeking a [...] "neutralist solution" [...] and [...] "negotiating with the communists", {{and as soon as the}} coup broke, he was immediately deemed by media analysts as a key figure behind the action.|$|E

2500|$|A {{national}} poll from Public Opinion Strategies from Oct 18–21 had Colbert receiving 2.3% of {{the vote}} in the Democratic field (ahead of Bill Richardson, Chris Dodd, Dennis Kucinich, and Mike Gravel) and less than 1% in the Republican field. A second poll, taken by Rasmussen Reports October 19–21 (before Colbert's Meet The Press appearance), had Colbert receiving 13% as an independent running against Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton, and 12% as an independent running against Fred Thompson and Clinton. Results were particularly high among respondents aged 18–29, where Colbert received 28% {{of the vote}} among likely voters in a Giuliani–Clinton contest, and 31% in a Thompson–Clinton contest.
