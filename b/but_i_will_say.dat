I will not say of my brother {{that he may be}} a traitor," [...] <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Produce what you have. I will judge it fairly, and if he is, he shall pay the penalties; but I will not take it on rumor. I will not take it on hearsay. I will remember that what has brought us up from savagery is a loyalty to truth, and truth cannot emerge unless it is subjected to the utmost scrutiny"—will you not agree that a society which has lost sight of that, cannot survive? ...|$|E

"Bossy" [...] {{was written}} by Shaffer Smith, known by his stage name Ne-Yo, while {{additional}} writing and song production was done by Stargate members Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen. In the beginning of May 2008, a clip of the song leaked on YouTube. As a result, Universal Motown released the full song to media outlets on May 7, 2008. In an interview with Billboard, Ne-Yo revealed that he was approached by the label to write a song for Lohan: [...] "I gotta admit, we were like ... Lindsay Lohan?' I mean, I've written for Beyoncé, Mary J. Blige, Rihanna, Celine Dion and ... Lindsay Lohan? <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> this; we gave her a quality record and she did a ridiculously fabulous job. I was so shocked I had to call her and apologize for what I was thinking because she did so good. I think the world is gonna be surprised." [...] In an interview with People Magazine, he revealed the song [...] "it's basically about a woman being strong enough to get what she wants when she wants it. In this case, 'Bossy' is a term that describes confidence and power." [...] "Bossy" [...] was digitally released on May 27, 2008, and it was set to appear on Lohan's third studio album.|$|E

It is the {{individual}} mind and conscience, it is the individual character, on which mainly human happiness or misery depends. (Cheers.) The social problems that confront us are many and formidable. Let the Government labour to its utmost, let the Legislature labour days and nights in your service; but, after the very best has been attained and achieved, the question whether the English father is to be the father of a happy family and the centre of a united home is a question which must depend mainly upon himself.
