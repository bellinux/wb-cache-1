The infant refuses all food, crying incessantly and intolerably. The sound drives X hysterical, and she leaves Spencer and the child. Spencer attempts {{to care for the}} child, and he learns that it struggles to <b>breathe</b> <b>and</b> has developed painful sores.|$|E
5|$|Donna is {{crushed by}} some {{scaffolding}} after {{she goes to}} a building site to pick up Ringo. Earlier in the day, Paul had tampered with the scaffolding platform due to a feud with the site's owner. Ringo helps Donna to <b>breathe</b> <b>and</b> she is rushed to hospital, where she undergoes surgery to repair a ruptured spleen. Donna and Ringo then reunite and Ringo proposes to her. However, Donna turns him down, before proposing to him herself. Ringo wins a green card to the United States and they decide to bring the wedding forward. Donna meets Ringo's mother, Prue (Penny Cook) and she later discovers Prue and Nick together. The wedding venue has to be changed and Donna's car breaks down, so Lucas has to drive Donna and Nick to the new venue. They are stopped by the police, but Donna eventually {{makes it to the}} ceremony and she and Ringo marry. Following the honeymoon, Donna moves in with the Kennedy family. On their one-month anniversary, Ringo is knocked down by Stephanie Scully's (Carla Bonner) motorbike and dies. Donna is devastated and she struggles to accept that he has gone. Donna initially blames Kate for Ringo's death because he pushed her out of the way. Donna is upset when she misses Ringo's funeral. Donna is angry when Paul tries to use her to upset Steph at her trial. She later tells the court that Steph should not go to jail as it will not bring Ringo back. Donna receives a letter from a New York design school and Zeke tells her that Ringo applied for a place on her behalf. After initially deciding to stay in Ramsay Street, Donna's friends manage to convince her to leave by staging a fashion show showcasing her designs. Donna says her goodbyes in the street and she leaves for New York with Nick.|$|E

25|$|The {{experiences}} {{of patients who}} have experienced anesthesia awareness vary widely depending on why they became aware, whether they were paralyzed and patient responses and sequelae vary widely as well.

40|$|AbstractWe {{have been}} studied about {{non-contact}} measurement of respiration and heart rates. In previous papers, the measurement system of small velocity using the M-sequence-modulated signal and phase difference of reflected signals from the target has been proposed. In this paper, we describe measurement of <b>breathing</b> <b>and</b> heartbeat in a standing position using the proposed method. Body-surface velocities by <b>breathing</b> <b>and</b> heartbeat could be observed respectively when the volunteer was <b>breathing</b> <b>and</b> holding the breath. In addition, measured velocity of breathing volunteer includes the component by heartbeat. It is considered that it has possibility to measure <b>breathing</b> <b>and</b> heartbeat concurrently...|$|R

25|$|Breath-hold {{blackout}} {{is a loss}} {{of consciousness}} caused by cerebral hypoxia {{towards the end of}} a breath-hold dive, when the swimmer does not necessarily experience an urgent need to <b>breathe</b> <b>and</b> has no other obvious medical condition that might have caused it. It can be provoked by hyperventilating just before a dive, or {{as a consequence of the}} pressure reduction on ascent, or a combination of these.

25|$|In a fire, PVC-coated wires {{can form}} {{hydrogen}} chloride fumes; the chlorine serves to scavenge free radicals {{and is the}} source of the material's fire retardance. While hydrogen chloride fumes can also pose a health hazard in their own right, it dissolves in moisture and breaks down onto surfaces, particularly in areas where the air is cool enough to <b>breathe,</b> <b>and</b> is not available for inhalation. Frequently in applications where smoke is a major hazard (notably in tunnels and communal areas), PVC-free cable insulation is preferred, such as low smoke zero halogen (LSZH) insulation.|$|E
25|$|Freediving {{blackout}}, breath-hold blackout or apnea blackout is a {{class of}} hypoxic blackout, a loss of consciousness caused by cerebral hypoxia {{towards the end of}} a breath-hold (freedive or dynamic apnea) dive, when the swimmer does not necessarily experience an urgent need to <b>breathe</b> <b>and</b> has no other obvious medical condition that might have caused it. It can be provoked by hyperventilating just before a dive, or {{as a consequence of the}} pressure reduction on ascent, or a combination of these. Victims are often established practitioners of breath-hold diving, are fit, strong swimmers and have not experienced problems before. Blackout may also be referred to as a syncope or fainting.|$|E
25|$|Finally {{going to}} Jack's backyard, Nick and Laurie find what Jack {{had meant to}} give them: a small pool filled with lime and muck with Taloa and two of her sisters, Ooki and Ibi, whom Jack had {{captured}} some days earlier. Meanwhile, Mallory goes into the sinkhole to investigate, but finds herself unable to <b>breathe</b> <b>and</b> surrounded by the small snake-like dragons. They manage {{to get her out}} and put three of the creatures in a jar. They figure that the creatures produce methane, which makes the air around them unbreathable, and realize that these were the creatures that the giants ate in order to breathe fire (which they originally believed to be salamanders).|$|E

25|$|After the examination, Arush's {{body was}} then used for medical {{practice}} for soldiers, demonstrating how to stab a tracheotomy into a wounded man's throat {{to allow him}} to <b>breathe,</b> <b>and</b> then used to demonstrate the proper preparation of a body for transportation. The body was then returned to the body bag, and sent into the local hospital, where Dr. Xelen released it to Arush's family the same evening. For the next two weeks, Colonel Allan Wells approached Vice-Admiral Larry Murray asking to send military police to Somalia to investigate the shooting, but was rebuffed. When the Chief of Defence Staff, Admiral John Rogers Anderson, visited the military base on March 8–9, he visited the wounded Somali recovering in the Canadian hospital.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of diphtheria usually begin two {{to seven days}} after infection. Symptoms of diphtheria include fever of 38°C (100.4°F) or above, chills, fatigue, bluish skin coloration (cyanosis), sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, foul-smelling and bloodstained nasal discharge, and lymphadenopathy. Within two to three days, diphtheria may destroy healthy tissues in the respiratory system. The dead tissue forms a thick, gray coating that can build up in the throat or nose. This thick gray coating is called a “pseudomembrane.” It can cover tissues in the nose, tonsils, voice box, and throat, making {{it very hard to}} <b>breathe</b> <b>and</b> swallow. Symptoms can also include cardiac arrhythmias, myocarditis, and cranial and peripheral nerve palsies.|$|E
25|$|Rask {{apparently}} {{suffered from}} symptoms of Pre-AIDS starting in late 1974, including diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, and fatigue. Although the symptoms receded temporarily following drug treatments in 1975, the symptoms later grew considerably worse. Following {{a vacation in}} South Africa in July 1977, {{she could no longer}} <b>breathe</b> <b>and</b> relied on bottled oxygen. She flew back to Denmark, where tests at Copenhagen's Rigshospitalet discovered she had contracted a number of opportunistic infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus (staph infection), candidiasis (yeast infection), and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP, a fungal infection of the lungs formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia). Tests also showed that Rask had a nearly non-existent T-cell count, leading to a severely depressed immune system. At the time, the doctors treating Rask were at a loss to explain her disease progression, which in retrospect, would come to be seen {{as one of the first}} cases of AIDS recorded outside Africa.|$|E

25|$|Primarily aquatic, {{they eat}} {{a wide variety}} of prey, almost {{anything}} they can manage to overpower, including fish, birds, a variety of mammals, and other reptiles. Particularly large anacondas may consume large prey such as tapirs, deer, capybaras, caimans, and even jaguars, but such large meals are not regularly consumed. The green anaconda's eyes and nose are located {{on the top of the}} head, allowing the snake to <b>breathe</b> <b>and</b> watch for prey while the vast majority of the body is hidden underwater. Many local stories and legends report the anaconda as a man-eater, but little evidence supports any such activity. They employ constriction to subdue their prey. Cannibalism among green anacondas is also known, most recorded cases involving a larger female consuming a smaller male. While the exact reason for this is not understood, scientists cite several possibilities, including the dramatic sexual dimorphism in the species, and the possibility that a female anaconda requires additional food intake after breeding to sustain the long period of gestation. The nearby male simply provides the opportunistic female a ready source of nutrition.|$|E
25|$|Harold Bishop {{visits and}} admits to having {{reservations}} about Amber and the wedding, causing Daniel to rescind his invitation. Paul also tries to stop Daniel from getting married by inviting Des Clarke (Paul Keane) {{to talk to}} him about his failed first wedding. On the day of the wedding, Daniel tries to persuade Imogen to attend, but she admits that she is in love with him. Daniel learns the whereabouts of Agnes Robinson's ring and Imogen goes with him to retrieve it from an old well. They become trapped in the well after the ladder breaks, causing Daniel to miss the wedding. The situation in the well grows worse when Imogen's asthma makes it hard for her to <b>breathe</b> <b>and</b> water is pumped in. Josh manages to work out where they are, leading to their rescue. Amber and Daniel reunite, and Amber learns she is pregnant. Amber admits that she had a one-night stand with Josh and a DNA test shows he is the father. Daniel tries to support Amber financially and sells some of his Off Air shares to Karl Kennedy. He and Amber later break-up.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} (funerary/mortuary) {{temple was}} {{on the north side}} of the pyramid and faced the north stars, which the king wished to join in eternity. This structure provided a place in which the daily rituals and offerings to the dead could be performed, and was the cult center for the king. To the east of the temple is the serdab, which is a small enclosed structure that housed the ka statue. The king’s ka inhabited the ka statue in order to benefit from daily ceremonies like the opening of the mouth, a ceremony that allowed him to <b>breathe</b> <b>and</b> eat, and the burning of incense. He witnessed these ceremonies through two small eye holes cut in the north wall of the serdab. This temple appeared {{on the north side of}} the pyramid throughout the Third Dynasty, as the king wished to go north to become one of the eternal stars in the North Sky that never set. In the Fourth Dynasty, when there was a religious shift to an emphasis on rebirth and eternity achieved through the sun, the temple was moved to the east side of the temple where the sun rises, so that through association the king may be reborn every day.|$|E
