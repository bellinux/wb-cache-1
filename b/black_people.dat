5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as <b>black</b> <b>people,</b> we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other <b>black</b> <b>people.</b> When you're black, {{you have to deal with}} so much crap in your life from other <b>black</b> <b>people.</b> It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other <b>black</b> <b>people.</b> And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of <b>black</b> <b>people</b> who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E

5|$|She {{used her}} access {{to form a}} {{coalition}} of leaders from black organizations called the Federal Council of Negro Affairs, but which {{came to be known}} as the Black Cabinet. It served as an advisory board to the Roosevelt administration on issues facing <b>black</b> <b>people</b> in America. It was composed of numerous talented blacks, mostly men, who had been appointed to positions in federal agencies. This was the first collective of <b>black</b> <b>people</b> working in higher positions in government. It suggested to voters that the Roosevelt administration cared about black concerns. The group gathered in Bethune's office or apartment and met informally, rarely keeping minutes. Although as advisers they did not directly create public policy, they were a respected leadership among black voters; they influenced political appointments and disbursement of funds to organizations that would benefit <b>black</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E

5|$|While {{the civil}} rights {{movement}} fought against racial segregation, MalcolmX advocated the complete separation of blacks from whites. The Nation of Islam proposed the establishment of a separate country for African Americans in the southern or southwestern United States as an interim measure until African Americans could return to Africa. MalcolmX suggested the United States government owed reparations to <b>black</b> <b>people</b> for the unpaid labor of their ancestors. He also rejected {{the civil rights}} movement's strategy of nonviolence, advocating instead that <b>black</b> <b>people</b> should defend themselves.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{no longer}} called for the {{separation}} of <b>black</b> <b>people</b> from white people, MalcolmX continued to advocate black nationalism, which he defined as self-determination for the African-American community. In {{the last months of}} his life, however, MalcolmX began to reconsider his support for black nationalism after meeting northern African revolutionaries who, to all appearances, were white.|$|E

In an attempt to show Ophelia that her views on blacks are wrong, St. Clare purchases Topsy, a young black slave, and asks Ophelia to educate her.|$|E

5|$|Biko saw white {{racism in}} South Africa as {{the totality of}} the white power structure. He argued that under apartheid, white people not only participated in the oppression of <b>black</b> <b>people</b> but were also the main voices in {{opposition}} to that oppression. He thus argued that in dominating both the apartheid system and the anti-apartheid movement, white people totally controlled the political arena, leaving <b>black</b> <b>people</b> marginalised. He believed white people were able to dominate the anti-apartheid movement because of their access to resources, education, and privilege. He noted that white South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally experienced the oppression that their black counterparts faced.|$|E
5|$|In April 1963, the SCLC began a {{campaign}} against racial segregation and economic injustice in Birmingham, Alabama. The campaign used nonviolent but intentionally confrontational tactics, developed in part by Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker. <b>Black</b> <b>people</b> in Birmingham, organizing with the SCLC, occupied public spaces with marches and sit-ins, openly violating laws that they considered unjust.|$|E
5|$|The Rosewood {{massacre}} was {{a racially}} motivated massacre of <b>black</b> <b>people</b> {{and destruction of}} a black town that {{took place during the}} first week of January 1923 in rural Levy County, Florida. At least six <b>black</b> <b>people</b> and two white people were killed, though eyewitness accounts suggested a death toll as high as 150. The town of Rosewood was abandoned and destroyed in what contemporary news reports characterized as a race riot. Racial disturbances were common during the early 20th century in the United States, reflecting the nation's rapid social changes. Florida had an especially high number of lynchings of black males in the years before the massacre, including a well-publicized incident in December 1922.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{death toll}} during the New York Draft Riots is unknown, but {{according}} to historian James M. McPherson, 119 or 120 people were killed. In all, eleven black men were lynched over five days. The riots forced hundreds of <b>black</b> <b>people</b> to flee the city. Violence by longshoremen against black men was especially fierce in the docks area.|$|E
5|$|After {{a lengthy}} time, {{it seems as}} if the dog is cured, in that he is now {{friendly}} towards Keys.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the {{population}} of the Congo numbered approximately 12million <b>black</b> <b>people</b> and 30,000 whites. The colonial government segregated the population along racial lines and there was very little mixing between the colours. The white population was highly urbanized and, in Léopoldville, the capital, lived in a quarter of the city separated from the black majority. All blacks in the city had to adhere to a curfew.|$|E

Soul venues in Baltimore in that period included The Royal and Carr's beach in Annapolis, one of the few beaches <b>black</b> <b>people</b> could use.|$|E
5|$|Biko's banning {{order in}} 1973 {{prevented}} him from working officially for the BCPs from which he had previously earned a small stipend, but he helped {{to set up a}} new BPC branch in Ginsberg, which held its first meeting in the church of a sympathetic white clergyman, David Russell. Establishing a more permanent headquarters in Leopold Street, the branch served as a base from which to form new BCPs; these included self-help schemes such as classes in literacy, dressmaking and health education. For Biko, community development was {{part of the process of}} infusing <b>black</b> <b>people</b> with a sense of pride and dignity. Near King William's Town, a BCP Zanempilo Clinic was established to serve as a healthcare centre catering for rural <b>black</b> <b>people</b> who would not otherwise have access to hospital facilities. He helped to revive the Ginsberg crèche, a daycare for children of working mothers, and establish a Ginsberg education fund to raise bursaries for promising local students. He helped establish Njwaxa Home Industries, a leather goods company providing jobs for local women. In 1975, he co-founded the Zimele Trust, a fund for the families of political prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Brodie {{believed}} that previous historians had unduly vilified Stevens, and she enjoyed {{the prospect of}} rebuilding a reputation rather than, as in her Joseph Smith biography, tearing one down. Stevens {{as a champion of}} <b>black</b> <b>people</b> was a timely interest as the Civil Rights Movement increased in intensity. Research materials were available at Yale University, where Bernard Brodie was employed. Fawn Brodie wondered how Stevens had been affected psychologically by his physical deformity, a club foot.|$|E

5|$|Elected {{officials}} in Florida represented the voting white majority. Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward (1905–1909) suggested finding a location {{out of state}} for <b>black</b> <b>people</b> to live separately. Tens {{of thousands of people}} moved to the North during and after World War I in the Great Migration, unsettling labor markets and introducing more rapid changes into cities. They were recruited by many expanding northern industries, such as the Pennsylvania Railroad, the steel industry, and meatpacking. Florida governors Park Trammell (1913–1917) and Sidney Catts (1917–1921) generally ignored the emigration of blacks to the North and its causes. While Trammell was state attorney general, none of the 29 lynchings committed during his term were prosecuted, nor were any of the 21 that occurred while he was governor. Catts ran on a platform of white supremacy and anti-Catholic sentiment; he openly criticized the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) when they complained he did nothing to investigate two lynchings in Florida. Catts changed his message when the turpentine and lumber industries claimed labor was scarce; he began to plead with black workers to stay in the state. By 1940, 40,000 <b>black</b> <b>people</b> had left Florida to find employment, but also to escape the oppression of segregation, underfunded education and facilities, violence, and disenfranchisement.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, {{when the}} British {{declared}} {{war against the}} Zulu Kingdom in Natal, Gandhi at age 36, sympathised with the Zulus, and encouraged the Indian volunteers to help as an ambulance unit. He argued that Indians should participate in the war efforts to change attitudes and perceptions of the British people against the coloured people. Gandhi, a group of 20 Indians and <b>black</b> <b>people</b> of South Africa volunteered as a stretcher-bearer corps to treat wounded British soldiers and {{the opposite side of}} the war: Zulu victims.|$|E
