40|$|The paper {{shows the}} shear-lag effect in slabs of twin-girder steel-concrete {{composite}} decks {{due to the}} main prestressing techniques such as support settlements, <b>bonded</b> <b>cables</b> inside the concrete slab, and external slipping tendons. The analysis is performed {{by means of a}} beam model taking into account the loss of planarity for the slab cross section, the flexibility of the shear connection, and the time-dependent behavior of the concrete. A linear elastic behavior is considered for the steel beams and shear connection while viscoelastic behavior is assumed for the concrete slab. A parametrical analysis is carried out on realistic bridge decks for each kind of prestressing technique, by varying the span length and the girder spacing. The distribution of longitudinal normal stresses in the slab is shown for each prestressing technique and the effective slab widths are then evaluated and compared with those suggested by ENV 1994 - 2 for different span lengths and for different spacing of the beams...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we obtain compact {{expressions}} for {{the magnetic field}} shielding factor of a high-voltage three-phase cable line consisting of single-core <b>cables</b> with two-point <b>bonded</b> <b>cable</b> shields and ferromagnetic cores installed. To obtain these expressions we develop the analytical model of the cable line. Following assumptions are made to develop the model: the current distribution in each cable shield is uniform, cylindrical ferromagnetic cores covering the cables are not magnetized to saturation and their magnetic permeability is constant, each of the ferromagnetic cores is magnetized only by the core current and the shield current of the cable that it covers, the magnetic field inside ferromagnetic cores is axisymmetric, the magnetic field is plane-parallel over the entire cable line. We consider common cases of flat and trefoil cable lines. The proposed expressions for the magnetic field shielding factor are verified experimentally.

Algorithms based on signal energy and on phase angle in frequency domain are preferred above e. g. threshold detection to determine PD arrival times. By introducing effective dielectric properties, cable parameters for accurate fault location as characteristic impedance and propagation velocity can be estimated also if data on semiconducting layers are unavailable. Models are proposed for cross-bonded connections and for three-core cables with common earth screen. A pulse injection circuit, already included in the PD equipment for time synchronisation, can be employed to extract a model for PDs passing ring main units or even entire substations...|$|R

50|$|Pinhole leaks with pitting {{initiating}} on {{the exterior}} surface of the pipe, can occur if copper piping is improperly grounded or bonded. The phenomenon is known technically as stray current corrosion or electrolytic pitting. Pin-holing due to poor grounding or poor bonding occurs typically in homes where the original plumbing has been modified; homeowners may find that a new plastic water filtration device or plastic repair union has interrupted the water pipe's electrical continuity to ground, when they start seeing pinhole water leaks after a recent install. Damage occurs rapidly, usually becoming obvious about {{six months after the}} ground interruption. Correctly installed plumbing appliances will have a copper <b>bonding</b> jumper <b>cable</b> connecting the interrupted pipe sections. Pinhole leaks from stray current corrosion can result in thousands of dollars in plumbing bills, and sometimes require the replacement of the entire affected water line. The cause is fundamentally an electrical defect, not a plumbing defect; once the plumbing damage is repaired, an electrician should promptly be consulted to evaluate the grounding and bonding of the entire plumbing and electrical systems.|$|R

Even though it is desirable that the system work properly each and every time it is called into use, some failures are bound to occur. Most failures, however, and especially those that occur most frequently, are due to poor installation techniques. An extra hour spent at an installation site can save many maintenance trips and many frustrating hours of system troubleshooting. Typical faults likely to cause communication outrage are Pager phone systems Poor splices aggravated by corrosion. Strain relief not provided. Drip loop not provided. Incorrect branch connections.

Carrier phones Mounting transceiver near load resistors or other sources of heat. Tracks not electrically <b>bonded.</b> <b>Cable</b> abrasion due to poor mounting location. Disconnected battery. Poor mechanical installation. Each installation should be well planned. After an installation is completed, the technician should ask the question, "What can go wrong with this unit or line?"

30|$|The low {{quasi-static}} {{strength of}} less than 1  MPa has to be considered and large bonding areas should be used. The impact tests on a compact specimen design to be mounted directly in a small Charpy test machine showed the well-known ability of elastic PUR adhesives for withstanding much higher impact loads than quasi-static loads. An approach on a similar specific energy application for a larger real mass bonded on a large area of {{the walls of a}} monopole, and a small specimen with low mass and small adhesive bond area was calculated. A repetitive application of only 39 blows with a specific configuration was performed and a small number of specimens achieved the target, others failed in different ways due to the not fully optimized method. In fact, not all specimens survived the full test period and showed that larger masses should be bonded on as much bonding area as possible and users of this technology should follow the joint design recommendations of best practices given in the literature. That leads in particular to the recommendation for <b>bonding</b> large structures (<b>cable</b> duct length of up to 50  m) in separated smaller sections instead. This approach mainly avoids interfering vibrations with large mass and amplitudes. Finally, the elastic adhesive showed also an excellent sealing function, which made the use of extra sealing material on the sensor housings obsolete. Hence, adhesive bonding of the entire equipment for a fully autonomously pile driving monitoring of an impact driven large scale foundation structure for an offshore wind farm can be considered a completely new and very reliable application method.|$|R
40|$|Cable bolt {{supports}} {{are widely}} used as ground support in underground hard rock and coal mines. During the last two decades, the cable bolt technology has improved significantly and new types of cable bolts, new grouts and new installation methods and pumps have been introduced and successfully developed. The design of cable bolts is currently attempted by empirical methods based on rockmass characterization. However, until such methods do {{not take into account}} all the important parameters affecting the mechanical behaviour of cable bolts namely, the type of cable geometry, grout quality, stiffness of the host medium, the amount of confining pressure and the presence of end anchorage and pretension. This thesis deals with the numerical modelling of cable bolts considering all of the above mentioned factors. To evaluate the shear <b>bond</b> stiffness of <b>cable</b> bolts, which simulate the interface between the cable bolt and the rockmass, a new empirical model is developed. A database with data of pull-out tests is constructed. Empirical relations were derived between the shear bond stiffness and the variation of confining pressure, the modulus of elasticity of host medium and the water:cement ratio. The relations were derived for three types of cables (standard cable, nutcase cable and garford bulb cable). A new numerical model using the finite element method is developed for the numerical simulation of cable bolts. Together with the empirical model for shear bond stiffness, the numerical model computes the load distribution along the cable bolt and thus can simulate fully grouted, partially grouted, end anchored and tensioned cable bolts. The model is implemented in an existing finite element code (e-z tools). Parametric analyses are performed on the new model, and proved useful in the demonstration of the role of each design parameter. A new design methodology is proposed to evaluate the load distribution along the cable bolt. Two case studies are presented: a stope hanging-wall support by cable bolt in a hardrock mine and a tailgate secondary supports in a coal mine.

40|$|The {{extension}} of the Dutch 380 kV high voltage grid is {{necessary in order to}} guarantee security of electricity supply to the consumers. To achieve this extension, there are two new 380 kV connections under construction in the Randstad area, a densely populated area {{in the western part of}} the Netherlands. In these 380 kV connections, underground cables are applied. The work described in this thesis forms a part of a monitoring program that is managed by the Dutch transmission grid operator TenneT. In this program, the behavior of the two new underground cable connections in the Dutch 380 kV grid is being investigated and the work described in this thesis contributes to this program. Unlike the common overhead transmission line, which has an inductive behavior, a cable acts as a capacitance when it is in operation. This difference in electrical behavior makes research on the grid behavior necessary. One of the research goals is to evaluate whether the power flows and voltage levels in the 380 kV grid stay within the prescribed limits. Another goal of this work is investigating whether the peak of the transient voltages at the cable terminals after lightning currents will stay below the Basic Insulation Level. The research is divided into two parts: steady state behavior and transient behavior. For the steady state part, PI sections are used to model the underground cable and overhead line to perform load flow studies in order to investigate the power flows and voltage levels in the 380 kV grid. For the transient part, the widely applied Frequency Dependent Phase Model (FDPM), which is a transmission line model that takes into account the frequency dependency of cable and line parameters, is used to model the cable and overhead line sections. For the transient part, the focus is on the modeling work of the complete underground cable system. Field measurements are performed for both the 380 kV cross-bonded cable and the overhead line sections and the results are used for transient cable model verification. The scientific contribution of this work is the determination of the parameters for the 380 kV cross bonding system by using reflection measurements and the validation of the FDPM transmission line model by using field measurements on the actual cross <b>bonded</b> 380 kV <b>cable</b> system. Finally, based on the studies described in this thesis, one can conclude that no remarkable overvoltages occur during the studied steady state and transient situations for the given dimensions of the observed 380 kV system.
