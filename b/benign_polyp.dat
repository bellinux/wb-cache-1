50|$|In 1988, Davis had a {{small part}} as a street {{musician}} in the Christmas comedy film Scrooged, starring Bill Murray. He also collaborated with Zucchero Fornaciari recording {{a new version of}} Dune Mosse (Blue's), published in 2004 in Zu & Co. of the italian bluesman. In November 1988, he was inducted into the Knights of Malta at a ceremony at the Alhambra Palace in Spain. Later that month, Davis cut his European tour short after he collapsed and fainted after a two-hour show in Madrid and flew home. Rumors of Davis' health were made public after the American tabloid magazine Star, in its February 21, 1989 edition, published that Davis had contracted AIDS, prompting Davis' manager Peter Shukat to issue a statement the following day to deny the claim. Shukat revealed Davis had been in hospital for a mild case of pneumonia and the removal of a <b>benign</b> <b>polyp</b> on his vocal cords, yet was resting comfortably in preparation for his 1989 tours. Davis later blamed one of his former wives or girlfriends for starting the rumor and decided against taking legal action. In 1989, Davis was interviewed on 60 Minutes by Harry Reasoner. In October 1989, Davis received a Grande Medaille de Vermeil from Paris mayor Jacques Chirac. In 1990, Davis received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In early 1991, he appeared in the Rolf de Heer film Dingo as a jazz musician.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the pattern of}} Ki- 67, Bcl- 2 and COX- 2 expression in the glandular epithelium and stroma of malignant and <b>benign</b> endometrial <b>polyps</b> in post-menopause. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 390 postmenopausal women underwent surgical hysteroscopy; women with endometrial polyps were included. Polypoid lesions were histologically classified as benign, premalignant or malignant lesions. Ki- 67, Bcl- 2 and COX- 2 expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry according to percentage of stained cells, staining intensity, and final score. RESULTS: The prevalence of malignancy in endometrial polyps was 7. 1 % and was associated with postmenopausal bleeding. The final score showed that only mean COX- 2 expression was higher in malignant polyps both in the glandular epithelium (6. 1 +/- 2. 5) (p < 0. 001) and stroma (2. 4 +/- 3. 0) (p < 0. 01). There was a higher Bcl- 2 expression, especially in the glandular epithelium, with no differences between <b>benign</b> <b>polyps</b> and premalignant/malignant polyps. Ki- 67 expression was low in both <b>benign</b> <b>polyps</b> and premalignant/malignant polyps. CONCLUSION: Polyps in postmenopause have a high COX- 2 expression that is higher in malignant <b>polyps</b> than in <b>benign</b> <b>polyps.</b> There {{was no difference in}} Ki- 67 and Bcl- 2 expression between malignant polyps and premalignant/malignant polyps.

40|$|Both serous intraepithelial {{carcinoma}} and endometrial glandular dysplasia {{are associated}} with uterine serous carcinoma. Recently a candidate serous cancer precursor containing p 53 mutations (p 53 signature) was described in the fallopian tube. We analyzed normal and neoplastic endometrium for a similar entity. Ten endometrial polyps involved by intraepithelial and/or invasive carcinoma and 137 <b>benign</b> <b>polyps</b> were studied. All were stained for p 53 and MIB- 1. A subset of p 53 signatures and carcinomas were analyzed for γ-H 2 AX and p 53 mutations. p 53 signatures were identified in 7 of 10 cases intraepithelial carcinoma and were multicentric in 2. In one case, the signature was in continuity with intraepithelial carcinoma. Six of 137 <b>benign</b> <b>polyps</b> (4 %) contained p 53 signatures. The MIB- 1 fraction in most signatures was less than 5 %, and ranged from 50 - 90 % in carcinomas. DNA damage (γ-H 2 AX) was demonstrated in both p 53 signatures and adjacent carcinomas but not in <b>benign</b> <b>polyps.</b> Shared identical p 53 mutations were found in paired signatures and carcinomas in two of three cases analyzed, including one case with multiple signatures. In one, a co-existent invasive serous cancer was not found to contain a p 53 mutation. In a third, a p 53 signature and an invasive cancer harbored two different p 53 mutations. This is the first description of p 53 signatures adjacent to carcinoma, suggesting a role for this entity in the genesis of serous malignancy.

40|$|Background: <b>Benign</b> {{epithelial}} gastric <b>polyps</b> {{have been}} reported to be more common in atrophic body gastritis. The role of Helicobacter pylori infection in the induction of gastric atrophy is well-known. The development of hyperplastic polyps may be in relation to H. pylori infection. Aim: To investigate occurrence of <b>benign</b> epithelial gastric <b>polyps</b> in atrophic body gastritis patients at diagnosis and follow-up, and the role of H. pylori and other risk factors for the development of <b>benign</b> epithelial gastric <b>polyps.</b> Methods: A total of 259 consecutive atrophic body gastritis patients included in a follow-up programme, of whom 202 were followed up for median period of 4 years (range: 2 - 11). At baseline and follow-up gastroscopies, the presence of <b>benign</b> epithelial gastric <b>polyps</b> was evaluated. Biopsies for histology were obtained from all detected <b>benign</b> epithelial gastric <b>polyps.</b> Results: Frequency of <b>benign</b> epithelial gastric <b>polyps</b> in atrophic body gastritis patients were 4. 6 % at baseline and 5. 9 % at follow-up. About 91. 7 % were hyperplastic polyps. H. pylori infection was detected in 79. 2 % atrophic body gastritis patients with <b>benign</b> epithelial gastric <b>polyps,</b> and in 70. 8 % without <b>benign</b> epithelial gastric <b>polyps.</b> Smoking was more frequent among patients with <b>benign</b> epithelial gastric <b>polyps</b> [42 % vs. 20 %, OR 2. 8 (95 % CI: 1. 2 - 6. 9) ]. Conclusions: <b>Benign</b> epithelial gastric <b>polyps</b> occur in about 5 % of atrophic body gastritis patients, and the vast majority are hyperplastic polyps. Smoking habit, but not H. pylori infection, increases the risk for <b>benign</b> epithelial gastric <b>polyps</b> in atrophic body gastritis patients...|$|R

40|$|AIM: Even though {{hereditary}} {{colorectal cancer}} (CRC) risk could be predicted in healthy siblings when a mismatch-repair germline mutation is found, no biologic test {{is available to}} predict sporadic CRCs. In these tumors, methylation of the whole hMLH 1 promoter leading {{to the lack of}} hMLH 1 protein expression has been related to carcino-genesis. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify a region in hMLH 1 promoter which methylation may confer to benign lesion a high risk of carcinogenesis. METHODS: To test the methylation status of the proximal hMLH 1 promoter, we ana-lyzed tumor samples obtained from 18 patients [6 showing benign polyps with micro-satellite stability (MSS), 6 showing MSS CRCs and 6 showing CRCs with microsatellite instability (MSI) ] by bisulfite sequencing. RESULTS: All tissues tested showed methylated CpG(s) 43 and 44. Among MSI CRCs, 3 showed a methylated status and no hMLH 1 staining, and 3 showed an un-methylated status and hMLH 1 staining. One <b>benign</b> <b>polyp</b> showed CpG(s) 1 to 37 methylated and 1 CRC sample with MSS status showed CpG(s) 1 to 23 methylated. Immunohistochemistry showed large areas with loss of hMLH 1 expression in the <b>benign</b> <b>polyp</b> even though hMLH 1 was detected in the CRC tissue sample with MSS status. CONCLUSION: The methylation of CpG(s) located in the 5 ' end of the hMLH 1 pro-moter until CpG 37 may be an early event of colorectal carcinogenesis. The hMLH 1 promoter region containing CpG(s) 23 to 37 might be a target zone to optimize a predic-tive bisulfite sequencing test to identify polyps with high risk of carcinogenesis...|$|E
30|$|There is {{evidence}} that all intrauterine polypoid lesions of symptomatic postmenopausal women should be removed completely. Endometrial cancer may be confused with <b>benign</b> <b>polyp</b> during hysteroscopy, so one cannot be sure of polyp diagnosis until it is totally removed [6, 10]. In our study, 5.4 % of apparently benign polyps on hysteroscopy effectively had focal hyperplasia on pathology and 0.6 % had focal carcinoma. Endometrial hyperplasia, especially atypical hyperplasia (a well-known risk factor for endometrial cancer) occurred in apparently benign polyps of both symptomatic and asymptomatic women. This aspect {{highlights the importance of}} total polyp excision after its diagnosis, even in asymptomatic patients. Additionally, endometrial polyp malignant degeneration is always a possibility to consider, occurring in 0.5 % to 4.8 % of the cases [6].|$|E
40|$|Colonic {{neoplasia}} {{provides an}} opportunity to study tumor progression because most carcinomas arise from adenomas (polyps), which, in turn, arise from normal epithelia. The malignant potential of adenomas varies with size, histology, and degree of dysplasia. Polyps that are less than 2 cm with villous architecture and severe dysplasia {{are most likely to}} contain carcinoma. Previous studies demonstrated that the in vitro protein-tyrosine kinase activity of pp 60 c-src from colon carcinomas is significantly higher than that from adjacent normal mucosa. Here we report that the protein kinase activity of pp 60 c-src is also elevated in colonic polyps. Activity is highest in malignant polyps and in greater than 2 -cm <b>benign</b> <b>polyps</b> that contain villous structure and severe dysplasia. Thus, pp 60 c-src activation occurs in <b>benign</b> <b>polyps</b> that are at greatest risk for developing cancer. These data suggest that activation of the protooncogene product pp 60 c-src may be an important event in the genesis of human colon carcinoma...|$|R
