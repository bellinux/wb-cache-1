50|$|Because {{water may}} form {{hydrogen}} bonds with solute proton donors and acceptors, it may competitively inhibit {{the formation of}} solute intermolecular or intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Consequently, hydrogen <b>bonds</b> <b>between</b> or within solute molecules dissolved in water are almost always unfavorable relative to hydrogen <b>bonds</b> <b>between</b> water and the donors and acceptors for hydrogen bonds on those solutes. Hydrogen <b>bonds</b> <b>between</b> water molecules have an average lifetime of 10−11 seconds, or 10 picoseconds.|$|R

5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} {{period of about}} five months, and normal labor takes one to three hours. Although some breeds regularly throw larger litters of lambs, most produce single or twin lambs.

5|$|In the manga Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Beveridge liked Sasuke's personality, {{particularly}} {{as it was}} presented during his dialogue with Naruto. Reviewing the anime adaptation, Sam Stewart from IGN was particularly impressed by the scenes between Sasuke and Sarada, most notably because of changes in Sasuke's characterization. He highlights that despite acting coldly towards his daughter, he ends up using his body as a shield {{to protect her from}} his enemy. Ken Iikura from Anime Now agreed, pointing out that Sasuke has become a loving husband and father in Boruto, despite retaining some of the dark aspects of his personality. Ikikura noted that Sasuke and Sarada's meeting in Boruto significantly developed both characters. McNulty disliked the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series, because she felt it was initially an one-sided crush on Sakura's part, but she believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden expanded on the <b>bond</b> <b>between</b> the two and their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Stewart praised Sasuke's portrayal as a flawed parent rather than an effortlessly good one, noting that his farewell to Sarada demonstrated his difficulty with being a good father. Another writer from Anime Now, Sarah Nelkin, noted that these episodes helped to develop Sasuke as both a father and a husband, especially when he explains to Sarada that she creates a <b>bond</b> <b>between</b> him and Sakura that persists despite his being frequently absent {{as a result of his}} mission.|$|E
5|$|In the manga series Pokémon Adventures, Team Rocket creates Mewtwo, {{but some}} of his DNA is placed inside of the Gym leader Blaine. Because of the DNA that they share, the two are unable to be {{separated}} for very long without becoming ill. Later, another Pokémon, Entei is able to break the <b>bond</b> <b>between</b> the two by removing the DNA in Blaine's arm, at which point Mewtwo leaves. It eventually helps the main character of the series, Red, fight against Team Rocket leader Giovanni and his Deoxys.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} also conjectured that the double <b>bond</b> <b>between</b> carbons 4 and 5 of the imidazolium ring backbone, which gave {{aromatic}} character to that system, {{was important for}} the carbene's stability. This conjecture was disproved in 1995 by Arduengo's group, who obtained a derivative of dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene, lacking the double bond. The thermodynamical stability in this compound, {{and the role of}} steric protection in preventing dimerisation, has been a topic of some dispute.|$|E

40|$|The FT-IR/ATR {{technique}} has been {{employed in the}} investigation of the forces leading to the organization of a number of polymeric materials exhibiting thermotropic liquid crystalline character. Two types of compounds have been studied, i. e., one bearing the carboxylic polar group near the main chain and the other {{at the end of the}} side chain. Intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>between</b> the carboxylic groups was found to lead to the formation of ''facing'' and ''sideways'' structures. Enhanced stability of these supramolecular structures was obtained by the presence of intramolecular hydrogen <b>bonds</b> <b>between</b> the amide groups, resulting in the formation of smectic phases. Furthermore, it has been found that the strengthening of hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>between</b> carboxylic groups is associated with a weakening of hydrogen <b>bonds</b> <b>between</b> the amide groups...|$|R

5|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} {{marriage}} is a social and spiritual <b>bond</b> <b>between</b> {{a man and a}} woman, ordered towards the good of the spouses and procreation of children; according to Catholic teachings on sexual morality, it is the only appropriate context for sexual activity. A Catholic marriage, or any marriage between baptised individuals of any Christian denomination, is viewed as a sacrament. A sacramental marriage, once consummated, cannot be dissolved except by death. The Church recognises certain conditions, such as freedom of consent, as required for any marriage to be valid; In addition, the Church sets specific rules and norms, known as canonical form, that Catholics must follow.|$|E
5|$|The first-ever {{terrorist}} attack on Jews in Mumbai occurred on 26 November 2008.

5|$|While the {{contemporary}} Western ideal sees {{marriage as a}} unique <b>bond</b> <b>between</b> {{two people who are}} in love, families in which heredity is central to power or inheritance (such as royal families) have often seen marriage in a different light. There are often political or other non-romantic functions that must be served and the relative wealth and power of the potential spouses may be considered. Marriage for political, economic, or diplomatic reasons, the marriage of state, was a pattern seen for centuries among European rulers.|$|E
5|$|While {{the flag}} {{agitation}} got its impetus from Gandhi's writings and discourses, the movement received political acceptance following the Nagpur incident. News reports, editorials and letters to editors published in various journals and newspapers {{of the time}} attest to the subsequent development of a <b>bond</b> <b>between</b> the flag and the nation. Soon, the concept of preserving the honour of the national flag became an integral component of the independence struggle. While Muslims were still wary of the Swaraj flag, it gained acceptance among Muslim leaders of the Congress and the Khilafat Movement as the national flag.|$|E
5|$|An {{essential}} element for the band’s image is the Slipknot logo. The nonagram {{was created by}} the band’s members around the same time the band was founded. The nonagram is arguably the best-known sigil of Slipknot and it represents a 9 point star – a symbol of unity, loyalty, friendship and remembrance. The logo is composed of three equilateral triangles each rotated at 0, 40, and 80 degrees. Each star point was meant to stand for each of the nine members of the original band. Despite popular belief, the nonagram is not a Satanist symbol, nor does it reflect something perverted, evil, unclean or sadistic. On the contrary, just as the band has officially declared on various occasions, the nonagram marks the unbreakable <b>bond</b> <b>between</b> its members. Chris Fehn is one of the band’s members who has a nonagram tattoo.|$|E

5|$|Clodius formed armed gangs that terrorised {{the city}} and {{eventually}} began to attack Pompey's followers, who in response funded counter-gangs formed by Titus Annius Milo. The political alliance of the triumvirate was crumbling. Domitius Ahenobarbus ran for the consulship in 55 BC promising to take Caesar's command from him. Eventually, the triumvirate was renewed at Lucca. Pompey and Crassus were promised the consulship in 55 BC, and Caesar's term as governor was extended for five years. Crassus led an ill-fated expedition with legions led by his son, Caesar's lieutenant, against the Kingdom of Parthia. This resulted in his defeat and death at the Battle of Carrhae. Finally, Pompey's wife, Julia, who was Caesar's daughter, died in childbirth. This event severed the last remaining <b>bond</b> <b>between</b> Pompey and Caesar.|$|E
5|$|Following her commissioning, Australia hosted several {{official}} events. On 30 June, King George V and Edward, Prince of Wales, visited Australia to farewell the ship. During this visit, King George knighted Patey on the ship's quarterdeck—the {{first time}} a naval officer was knighted aboard a warship since Francis Drake. On 1 July, Patey hosted a luncheon which was attended by imperial dignitaries, including Reid, the Agents-General of the Australian states, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, Secretary of State for the Colonies Lewis Harcourt, and the High Commissioners of other British Dominions. That afternoon, 600 Australian expatriates were invited to a ceremonial farewelling, and were entertained by shows and fireworks. Journalists and cinematographers were allowed aboard to report on Australia prior to her departure, and an official reporter was embarked for the voyage to Australia: his role was to promote the ship {{as a symbol of}} the <b>bond</b> <b>between</b> Australia and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Pompey and Crassus proved {{themselves}} to be as incompetent as Caesar had hoped. Clodius terrorized the city with his armed gangs, and agitated Pompey {{to such a degree}} that Pompey was able to secure the passage of a law in 57 BC which recalled Cicero from his exile. This was more of a triumph for the senate than it was for Pompey, however, since Pompey was allied with Caesar. Pompey was so inept that the senate decided to override him, and rescind the land laws that Caesar had passed in 59 BC for Pompey's veterans. This forced a renewal of the triumvirate: Pompey and Crassus were promised the Consulship in 55 BC and Caesar's term as governor was extended for five years. Caesar's daughter, and Pompey's wife, Julia, soon died in childbirth, and a year later, Crassus was killed during his invasion of the Parthian Empire. These two events severed the last remaining <b>bond</b> <b>between</b> Pompey and Caesar.|$|E
