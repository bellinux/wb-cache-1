5|$|A quick cut later, the costumed {{character}} {{is looking at}} the camera again with hands at its sides. After a few more jump cuts in which they turn to the right and back again, the figure stands still, then looks to its left slowly. The figure looks down to where a box with various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure stands still with its <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> with the camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E
25|$|Beyond the Wall, Jon Snow joins Mance Rayder's {{wildling}} army, {{but with}} hidden intentions. His vows are tested {{more than ever}} by a growing romance with wildling Ygritte, as he finds {{that he will have}} to choose between her and the Night's Watch. The latter has been largely decimated by a White Walker attack, and a group of them is making their way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall.</b> However, many of the rangers find themselves also questioning their vows, putting Lord Commander Mormont's and Samwell Tarly's lives in danger.|$|E
25|$|With his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> Reagan won {{shocking}} {{victories in}} North Carolina and Texas, which propelled the race {{all the way}} to the national convention in Kansas City. Laxalt nominated Reagan at the convention. Eventually, the Reagan campaign lost a key procedural vote to Ford and the sitting President eked out a victory. Although he was on the losing side, Laxalt's national profile increased dramatically as a result of his efforts on behalf of Reagan. When Reagan defeated incumbent President Jimmy Carter in 1980, with Laxalt again serving as national chairman, the Nevada Senator's profile rose even higher.|$|E

25|$|The largest version, painted {{between the}} years 1890–1892, {{is the most}} complex, with five figures on a 134.6 x 180.3cm (53 × 71 in) canvas. It {{features}} three card players at the forefront, seated in a semi-circle at a table, with two spectators behind. On {{the right side of}} the painting, seated behind the second man and to the right of the third, is a boy, eyes cast downward, also a fixed spectator of the game. Further back, on the left side between the first and second player is a man standing, <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> smoking a pipe and presumably awaiting his turn at the table. It has been speculated Cézanne added the standing man to provide depth to the painting, as well as to draw the eye to the upper portion of the canvas.|$|E
25|$|Outside, Tormund {{moves to}} kill the old man, but Orell tells him to have Jon do it instead to prove his loyalty. Jon is {{ultimately}} unable {{to kill the}} innocent man, and instead Ygritte kills the man with an arrow. Realizing where Jon's loyalties lie, Tormund orders his men to kill him, but Jon manages to defeat them. As Ygritte moves to defend him, Jon deliberately knocks her to the ground, allowing Tormund to hold her down and prevent her from getting killed, while he battles with Orell. Bran enters the mind of Summer, his direwolf, and aids Jon. Jon kills Orell while the wolves hold off the other wildlings, and is then able to steal a horse and escape, leaving Ygritte and heading <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall.</b> At night, Bran asks Osha to take Rickon to Last Hearth, {{the home of the}} Umber family, and they depart shortly after.|$|E
500|$|Ned is {{informed}} that a deserter of the Night's Watch, Will, has been captured. Members of the Night's Watch are sworn never to desert their posts, upon penalty of death. Ned takes his sons to witness Will's execution. Will reports repeatedly {{that he saw}} White Walkers, but nobody believes him. The young man faces death bravely, admitting that he [...] "should have gone <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> and warned them". Ned himself passes sentence and beheads him. When Bran asks his father about the ranger's talk of White Walkers, Ned dismisses it as a madman's ravings, insisting that the Walkers have been considered extinct for thousands of years.|$|E

500|$|Attempting {{to bolster}} the North's {{defenses}} in [...] "Dragonstone", Jon is frustrated when his authority is undermined by Sansa, who does {{not want him to}} repeat the mistakes that got their father Ned and brother Robb killed. Jon dismisses a message from Cersei Lannister that he swear his allegiance to her. In [...] "Stormborn", he receives an invitation to Dragonstone from Tyrion on Daenerys Targaryen's behalf. Subsequently, receiving a message from Sam that a hoard of obsidian lies beneath the ancient Targaryen castle, Jon decides to meet Daenerys, leaving a surprised Sansa as his regent. At Dragonstone, he declines swearing fealty to Daenerys in [...] "The Queen's Justice", and instead asks for her assistance fighting the White Walkers. She demurs, but permits him to mine the obsidian. In [...] "Eastwatch", Daenerys is surprised when her dragon Drogon approaches Jon and allows the King in the North to pet him. Determined to convince Cersei that their true enemy is the army of the dead, Jon leads an expedition north of the Wall to capture a wight and bring it south to King's Landing. They manage to do so in [...] "Beyond the Wall", but are surrounded by a horde of the Night King's minions. Daenerys arrives with her dragons, but the Night King kills one of them with an ice spear, forcing the others to flee without Jon. He is saved by the reappearance of his uncle Benjen, who is overtaken by the dead as Jon escapes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall.</b> Daenerys vows to fight the White Walkers with Jon, and he agrees to swear fealty to her as his queen. In [...] "The Dragon and the Wolf", the two negotiate a truce with Cersei, who agrees to join them in fighting the Night King's forces. Bran learns that Jon was born Aegon Targaryen, the legitimate son and heir of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. Meanwhile, Jon and Daenerys finally give in to their growing attraction for each other and fall into bed together, unaware that they are related by blood.|$|E
2500|$|With his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> Charnock {{was desperately}} willing to {{negotiate}} with Shaista Khan {{to get out of}} this mess. Luck favored him because of an unexpected event. At the time when Nicholson was ordered to proceed to Chittagong, Sir John Child was ordered to withdraw the company’s establishment from Bombay, commence hostilities on the western coast, blockade Mughal harbors and attack their ships anywhere to be found. Emperor Aurangzeb wanted to reconcile with the British to ensure uninterrupted voyage of pilgrims to Mecca and asked his Governors to make terms with them.|$|E
2500|$|Mass flight {{accompanied}} the fighting {{from the beginning}} of the civil war. In the absence of proper military objectives, the antagonists carried out their attacks on non-combatant targets, subjecting civilians of both sides to deprivation, intimidation and harassment. Consequently, the weaker and backward Palestinian society collapsed under a not-overly-heavy strain. Unlike the Jews, who had nowhere to go and fought with their <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> the Palestinians had nearby shelters. From the beginning of hostilities, an increasing flow of refugees drifted into the heart of Arab-populated areas and into adjacent countries.... The Palestinians' precarious social structure tumbled because of economic hardships and administrative disorganization. Contrary to the Jews who built their [...] "State in the Making" [...] during the mandate period, the Palestinians had not created in time substitutes for the government services that vanished with the British withdrawal. The collapse of services, the lack of authority and a general feeling of fear and insecurity generated anarchy in the Arab sector.|$|E

2500|$|Spurrier was the Gators' {{starting}} quarterback and team leader in 1965 and 1966. He finished his three-year, thirty-one-game college career having completed 392 of 692 attempts for 4,848 passing yards and 37 touchdowns, breaking every UF and many conference records for passing and total offense. In {{addition to being}} a stellar passer, Spurrier gained notoriety by playing his best under pressure; eight times during his college career, he led the Gators to fourth quarter comeback wins. The most memorable example was a November 1966 game against Auburn, when, after leading the team down the field on a two minute drill, he waved off Florida's regular placekicker and booted a forty-yard field goal, giving the Gators a 30–27 win and likely securing himself the Heisman Trophy. [...] This penchant for dramatic comebacks prompted John Logue of the Atlanta Constitution to famously write [...] "Blindfolded, with his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> with his hands tied behind him, Steve Spurrier would be a two-point favorite at his own execution." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the battle, the Luftwaffe {{had to use}} {{numerous}} reconnaissance sorties {{to make up for}} {{the poor}} intelligence. Reconnaissance aircraft (initially mostly Dornier Do 17s, but increasingly Bf 110s) proved easy prey for British fighters, as it was seldom possible for them to be escorted by Bf 109s. Thus, the Luftwaffe operated [...] "blind" [...] for much of the battle, unsure of its enemy's true strengths, capabilities, and deployments. Many of the Fighter Command airfields were never attacked, while raids against supposed fighter airfields fell instead on bomber or coastal defence stations. The results of bombing and air fighting were consistently exaggerated, due to inaccurate claims, over-enthusiastic reports and the difficulty of confirmation over enemy territory. In the euphoric atmosphere of perceived victory, the Luftwaffe leadership became increasingly disconnected from reality. This lack of leadership and solid intelligence meant the Germans did not adopt consistent strategy, even when the RAF had its <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Moreover, there was never a systematic focus on one type of target (such as airbases, radar stations, or aircraft factories); consequently, the already haphazard effort was further diluted.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{following}} {{the story of}} a central character, Redford Stevens, on the album was the idea of band manager Richard Nichols. According to Questlove, the album's protagonist Redford is [...] "the prototypical urban kid — young, gifted, black, and unraveling before our eyes," [...] and is based on [...] "a combination of maybe four to five people that we know in Philadelphia." [...] Regarding the character, Black Thought said, [...] "Redford's story isn't uncommon in Philadelphia ... I remember not being able to imagine being alive as a 30-year-old. I didn't know many people who had lived to 30." [...] Inspiration for Redford was also culled from the Sufjan Stevens song [...] "Redford (For Yia-Yia & Pappou)" [...] from his album Michigan and the character Avon Barksdale from TV series The Wire. Some sources have interpreted Redford as an African-American everyman, though others have cautioned against this view, emphasizing his individual characteristics. For instance, Hilary Brown of Down Beat called Redford [...] "a romantic, not a thug; a philosopher, not an everyman," [...] and Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah wrote [...] "The mistake is to read Redford as being like anyone who has their <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> or to see the album’s narrative as a universal story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Henry Rollins, in {{his journal}} {{collection}} Get in the Van, notes that Pettibon's artwork became synonymous with Black Flag and that before Rollins joined the band he would collect photocopies of their flyers that had circulated from California to Washington, D.C. The album cover for Nervous Breakdown had a particularly strong impact on Rollins: [...] "The record's cover art said it all. A man with his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> baring his fists. In front of him another man fending him off with a chair. I felt like the guy with his fists up {{every day of my}} life." [...] Another image which drew considerable attention was the artwork created for the [...] "Police Story" [...] single, showing a police officer being held with a gun in his mouth with the speech blurb [...] "Make me come, faggot!" [...] The image was plastered on flyers all around Los Angeles and added to the police pressure on the band. Pettibon later remarked that [...] "my values are relativistic, and I'll give a cop the benefit of the doubt. If that's me with my gat – my gat's larger than the one depicted – we can have a discussion, and he can answer me just as well with my [...]357 barrel in his mouth, or on his cheek, or on his adenoids, or down his throat. I'll listen to his whimpering cries." ...|$|E
