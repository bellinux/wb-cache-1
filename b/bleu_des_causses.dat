Genera Lactobacillus spp. and Enterococcus spp. are prevalent microorganisms present in these cultures. Of course, these microorganisms are for us interesting because of their possibility of coagulation, proteolytic possibility, probiotic function and antibiotic resistance, but especially because of their decarboxylation abilities. Bacteria contain decarboxylation enzymes, which are able to decarboxylized free amino acid, which rising at proteolysis during process of manufacturing and cheese ripening. Biogenic amines {{are the result of}} proteolytic activity. Biogenic amines occur practically in all foodstuffs as a common product of metabolic processes. BA are mainly presented in fermented food (cheeses), where rice just microbial action. Typical representatives of biogenic amines, which occurs in double moulded cheeses (Sedlčanský Vltavín, Bresse bleu) and in blue cheeses (<b>Bleu</b> <b>des</b> <b>Causses,</b> Bleu d'Auvergne) are cadaverine, putrescine, tyramine a 2 fenylethylamine and in much smaller amount histamine, spermidine and spermine too. On assessment concentration of BA is used high pressure liquid chromatography with reverse phase (RP HPLC) with utilizing simple direct derivatization with dansyl chloride and detection by UV VIS detector...|$|E
