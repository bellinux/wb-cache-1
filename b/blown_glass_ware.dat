5000|$|Scanga's newest {{series of}} works, the [...] "Potato Famine" [...] sculptures, are logical {{extensions}} {{of his earlier}} efforts. He begins with the familiars of saints and tools, but here they are supporting armatures not focal points. If his earlier offerings of herbs, peppers, and the like were presented in <b>blown</b> <b>glass</b> peasant <b>ware</b> or hung as dried provisions domesticating an exhibition space, these potato supplications are affixed directly to the accompanying icons—not unlike the devotions pinned directly to the images of saints and Madonnas as they are paraded before the faithful in street processions. Other spuds rest in huge ladles and bowls just as they are—a simple, raw food—uncooked but potentially nourishing.|$|R

5000|$|According to art {{historian}} Martha Drexler Lynn, [...] "Labino had a life-long love of tools, inventing and problem-solving which he {{coupled with a}} passion for artistic endeavors..." [...] His interest in <b>blowing</b> <b>glass</b> began in the 1930s, when he ran the Owens-Illinois milk bottling plant. There he had a laboratory in which he created glass formulas. In 1940, his predecessor at the plant, Ben Alderson, showed Labino how to <b>blow</b> <b>glass.</b> Labino later <b>blew</b> <b>glass</b> as a hobby; at Johns-Manville he built a home glass furnace at which to pursue the craft. An early project was a glass paperweight that he created in 1958 for a friend's retirement. By 1960 he had melted a batch of glass and created a primitive blowpipe.|$|R
