5000|$|Since 2013, the {{balloons}} in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade {{have come in}} two varieties. The first (and older of the two) is the novelty <b>balloon</b> <b>class,</b> consisting of smaller balloons; the novelty balloons range widely in size and are handled by between one and thirty people (the smallest novelty balloons are shaped like human heads and fit on the actual heads of the handlers). The second and more widely known is the full-size <b>balloon</b> <b>class,</b> primarily consisting of licensed pop-culture characters; each of these is handled by exactly 90 people. From 2005 to 2012, a third <b>balloon</b> <b>class,</b> the [...] "Blue Sky Gallery," [...] transformed the works of contemporary artists into full-size balloons.|$|E
40|$|A new {{transponder}} and RF {{ground support}} equipment for the NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) intended to support long duration scientific balloon flights in Antarctica are described. The new <b>balloon</b> <b>class</b> transponder features a highly integrated spread spectrum receiver design based on programmable charge coupled device (CCD) correlators and digital signal processing chips. The correlator chip is a Lincoln Labs 4 ABC with four CCD channels. The balloon transponder is capable of reporting an estimate of its input bit error rate using digital signal processing. The TDRSS user RF test set {{is based on a}} set of RF {{ground support equipment}} capable of providing both the RF communications and direct control and monitoring necessary for transponder testing and a two-way RF link for preflight testing...|$|E

50|$|The {{school was}} built {{during a period}} of rapid {{expansion}} of the then Princess Anne County. The cost of construction and equipment was $3,500,000, which included approximately $1,000,000 of federal funds. The school was first occupied in September 1954. Several schools had previously been built and remain in use today, however, they were converted to smaller middle or elementary schools in order to address <b>ballooning</b> <b>class</b> sizes. In 1963, Princess Anne County was incorporated into the newly formed City of Virginia Beach and thus PAHS became the oldest remaining high school in the system.|$|R
50|$|Performance related {{activities}} {{found at}} magic camp include, card magic class, coin magic <b>class,</b> <b>balloon</b> twisting, linking rings, and juggling. Other activities include the Stage workshops.|$|R
50|$|As part of Grand Prix of Zagainov in 1996 Victor {{organized}} national records setting flight for Hot Air <b>Balloons</b> {{of different}} <b>classes.</b> This {{was a first}} time any Hot Air Balloon record registration request was submitted to FAI.|$|R
50|$|On Mum Day, one of {{the nations}} oldest high school traditions. the Friday before the {{football}} game against long standing rival, St. Vincent-St. Mary High School, all students are silent upon arrival at school, and during the day between classes. The only exception, which is rare is to speak when called upon in class. Most teachers even remain silent during class and instruct without speaking. The day before, the seniors decorate the school overnight with streamers, <b>balloons,</b> etc. <b>Classes</b> are shortened and all students, teachers and staff gather in Barry Gymnasium {{at the end of}} the day for loud and spirited pep rally.|$|R

Caption: "Johnny BArnes and Mary Kilgore, student in Rita Shaw's fourth-grade class at Rockwood Elementary School, 3104 SW 24, show a hot-air balloon and the makings of another, as part of a hot-air <b>balloon</b> study the <b>class</b> has completed. Other {{balloons}} are hanging from the classroom ceiling. ...|$|R
40|$|The NASA {{philosophy}} and {{criteria for the}} design and flight of scientific balloons are set forth and discussed. The thickness of balloon films is standardized at 20. 3 microns to isolate potential film problems, and design equations are given for specific balloon parameters. Expressions are given for: flight-stress index, total required thickness, cap length, load-tape rating, and venting-duct area. The balloon design criteria {{were used in the}} design of scientific balloons under NASA auspices since 1986, and the resulting designs are shown to be 95 percent effective. These results represent {{a significant increase in the}} effectiveness of the balloons and therefore indicate that the design criteria are valuable. The criteria are applicable to four <b>balloon</b> volume <b>classes</b> in combination with seven payload ranges...|$|R
5000|$|It was 3:43 p.m. {{when the}} phone rang at Longview center, [...] "Glen, this is Bussey. Iâ€™m down and safe. Let me tell you where I am." [...] Bussey had landed about 15 mi south of Savannah just across Highway 17, the old coast highway. Jim Herschend and Mike Mills in the chase plane watched and photographed the near {{stand-up}} landing, then landed their plane and were with Bussey about 30 minutes later. Duane Clark arrived less than an hour after touchdown. Chase Two was about four hours away and Chase One was still six hours behind. The flight had lasted eleven hours and nineteen minutes, covering 892 mi, setting four world records for distance in AX-6, 7, 8 & 9 balloons and setting 10 US national records for distance in AX-6-15 balloons. Bussey still holds the world record for distance in AX-6 and AX-7 <b>class</b> <b>balloons.</b>|$|R
