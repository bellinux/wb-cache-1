5|$|In 1949, Disney and {{his family}} moved to a new home in the Holmby Hills {{district}} of Los Angeles. With the help of his friends Ward and Betty Kimball, who already had their own <b>backyard</b> <b>railroad,</b> Disney developed blueprints and immediately set to work on creating a miniature live steam railroad for his backyard. The name of the railroad, Carolwood Pacific Railroad, came from his home's location on Carolwood Drive. The miniature working steam locomotive was built by Disney Studios engineer Roger E. Broggie, and Disney named it Lilly Belle after his wife; after three years Disney ordered it into storage due to a series of accidents involving his guests.|$|E
500|$|By 1948, Walt Disney's {{interest}} in model trains was evolving into an {{interest in}} larger, ridable miniature trains after observing the trains and <b>backyard</b> <b>railroad</b> layouts of several hobbyists, including Disney animator Ollie Johnston. In 1949, after purchasing [...] of vacant land in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, he started construction on a new residence {{for himself and his}} family, and on the elaborate [...] gauge ridable miniature Carolwood Pacific Railroad behind it. The railroad featured a set of freight cars pulled by the Lilly Belle, a 1:8-scale live steam locomotive named after Disney's wife Lillian and built by the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop team led by Roger E. Broggie. The locomotive's design, chosen by Walt Disney after seeing a smaller locomotive model with the same design at the home of rail historian Gerald M. Best, was based directly on copies of the blueprints for the Central Pacific No. 173, a steam locomotive rebuilt by the Central Pacific Railroad in 1872. The Lilly Belle first ran on the Carolwood Pacific Railroad on May 7, 1950. Walt Disney's <b>backyard</b> <b>railroad</b> attracted visitors interested in riding his miniature steam train, and on weekends, when the railroad was operating, he allowed them to do so, even allowing some to become [...] "guest engineers" [...] and drive the train. In early 1953, after a visitor drove the Lilly Belle too fast along a curve, causing it to derail and injure a five-year-old girl, Walt Disney, fearing the possibility of future accidents, closed down the Carolwood Pacific Railroad and placed the locomotive in storage.|$|E

5000|$|The {{live steam}} hobby is {{especially}} {{popular in the}} UK, US, and Australia. All over the world, {{there are hundreds of}} clubs and associations as well as many thousands of private <b>backyard</b> <b>railroads.</b> The world's largest live steam layout, with over 25 mi of [...] trackage is Train Mountain Railroad [...] in Chiloquin, Oregon. Other notable layouts are operated by the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum and the Riverside Live Steamers.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to being the last great assembly of railroad equipment and technology by participating railroad companies, the 1948 Chicago Railroad Fair holds a lesser known honor and connection to Disneyland. In 1948 Walt Disney and animator Ward Kimball attended the fair. To their enjoyment they not only got {{to see all of}} the equipment, but they were also allowed to operate some of the steam locomotives that were at the Fair. Upon their return to Los Angeles, Disney used the Fair, the House of David Amusement Park, and Greenfield Village, as inspiration for a [...] "Mickey Mouse Park" [...] that eventually became Disneyland. [...] Walt also went on to build his own <b>backyard</b> <b>railroads,</b> building the Carolwood Pacific Railroad. Kimball already had his own, named Grizzly Flats Railroad.|$|R
2500|$|Ward Kimball {{shared his}} {{railroad}} hobby with fellow Disney animator Ollie Johnston, {{who owned a}} ridable miniature railroad, and Walt Disney. On October 20, 1945, Disney attended one of the Kimball's [...] "steam-ups", which were parties hosted at their home when the Grizzly Flats Railroad was in operation. During the party, Disney was {{given the opportunity to}} drive the GFRR's Emma Nevada locomotive, which was the first time since working as a teenager on the Missouri Pacific Railway that he had been inside a locomotive cab. Disney eventually decided to have his own <b>backyard</b> <b>railroad</b> built, which he named Carolwood Pacific Railroad. Disney's ridable miniature <b>backyard</b> <b>railroad,</b> and the narrow-gauge GFRR, inspired Disney to create the Disneyland Railroad within the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California. The Disneyland Railroad's Frontierland Station depot building was built using the same blueprints for the GFRR's depot building.|$|E
2500|$|By 1948, Walt Disney's {{interest}} in model trains was evolving into an {{interest in}} larger, ridable miniature trains after observing the trains and <b>backyard</b> <b>railroad</b> layouts of several hobbyists. These hobbyists included Disney animator Ollie Johnston, who had a ridable miniature railroad; and Disney animator Ward Kimball, who owned the full-size, [...] narrow-gauge Grizzly Flats Railroad. On June 1, 1949, Walt Disney purchased [...] of vacant land in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. The property consisted of a bluff, which was [...] in size; and a level shelf of land behind it, which Disney named Yensid Valley. The word Yensid is Disney spelled backwards. Disney purchased this land {{in order to build}} a new residence for himself and his family, and an elaborate <b>backyard</b> <b>railroad</b> behind it. The railroad's layout was planned to include [...] of [...] gauge track with eleven switches, as well as gradients, overpasses, a trestle, and an elevated dirt berm. The layout would completely surround the house. Disney's wife, Lillian Disney, objected to the plan that part of the layout be built in an area where she intended to plant a flower garden. As a compromise, Disney had an S-curve tunnel built underneath the future spot for the garden. Aided by a Walt Disney Studios' attorney, Disney had a tongue-in-cheek legal contract written to establish his right to own and operate the railroad's right of way, which was signed by him and his wife, and witnessed by their two daughters. Disney named his railroad Carolwood Pacific Railroad (CPRR) in reference to his address at 355 Carolwood Drive. The railroad would end up costing $50,000, split evenly between its layout and rolling stock.|$|E
2500|$|The Carolwood Pacific Railroad (CPRR) was a 7 1⁄4-inch (...) gauge ridable {{miniature}} railroad {{built for}} Walt Disney {{at his home}} in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, in the United States. It featured the Lilly Belle, a 1:8-scale live steam locomotive built by the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop, and was first test run on December 24, 1949. The locomotive pulled a set of freight cars and a caboose, the latter of which was almost entirely built by Disney himself. The railroad, which became operational in 1950, was [...] long and encircled his house. Disney's <b>backyard</b> <b>railroad</b> attracted visitors interested in riding his miniature steam train and on weekends, when the railroad was operating, he allowed them to do so. In 1953, after an accident occurred in which a guest was injured, the CPRR was closed to the public.|$|E

50|$|Hurlbut's {{amusement}} park experience began with designing and building small-scale trains {{for people to}} ride. He sold 12 of them to other operators, then installed one in his own kiddie park in El Monte, CA {{in the parking lot}} of Crafords market.One of Hurlbut's trainsets operated at The Pike in Long Beach, CA. He also designed the replica 1880's train that ran for many years in Santa's Village in the San Bernardino Mountains, and now is at the Santa Ana Zoo. He built the first train for the Nut Tree restaurant complex in Vacaville, CA that would ferry incoming flyers from the Nut Tree Airport to the toy shop and restaurant plaza. Another of Hurbut's trains, built in 1938, is in operation at Adventure City, which is part of the Hobby City complex in Anaheim, CA. Others are at Canaan Land Christian Retreat in Lake Toxaway, NC, Maricopa Live Steamers in Phoenix, AZ, Castle Park in Riverside, CA (see below), and numerous private individuals' <b>backyard</b> <b>railroads</b> across the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Kimball is {{credited}} with helping Walt Disney for the inspiration to install the Disneyland Railroad at Disneyland. Inspiration for the Disneyland Railroad also partly came from Disney's personal [...] gauge, live steam <b>backyard</b> Carolwood Pacific <b>Railroad,</b> which Kimball had partially constructed. Kimball's Grizzly Flats train station served {{as the model for}} the Disneyland Frontierland Train Station. As a tribute to Kimball, Engine No. 5 of the Disneyland Railroad is named the Ward Kimball.|$|R
2500|$|In 1938, Disney {{animator}} Ward Kimball, {{a lifelong}} railfan, purchased a passenger coach, built in 1881 by the Barney and Smith Car Company, from the Carson and Colorado Railroad. The original {{intention was to}} use the coach to house his collection of model trains {{at his home in}} San Gabriel, California; however, Kimball's wife, Betty Kimball, suggested that he should also have a locomotive to pull the coach. A suitable locomotive was purchased for $400 from the Nevada Central Railroad, which was selling it for scrap. The locomotive was the Sidney Dillon, a 2-6-0 steam locomotive built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1881. Kimball renamed the locomotive Emma Nevada, after a famous opera star of the late 1800s. Over the course of several years, Kimball, his family, and his friends worked to restore the Emma Nevada to operating condition. Kimball's railroad became operational in 1942. Kimball named his railroad Grizzly Flats Railroad (GFRR), and it would eventually consist of [...] of [...] narrow-gauge track, including a [...] main line, in his backyard.

5000|$|Walt Disney Miniature Railroad {{was formed}} by Walt Disney in 1950 to manage the Carolwood Pacific <b>Railroad,</b> his {{elaborate}} <b>backyard</b> miniature <b>railroad.</b> The company's name was changed to Walt Disney, Inc. (WDI) on December 16, 1952, and its purpose was changed to supposedly produce TV shows. However, he soon started the Disneyland designing and engineering division within WDI. He also assigned the rights to his name and likeness to the company, as well as ownership of the Disneyland Railroad, Mark Twain Steamboat, Viewliner Train of Tomorrow (defunct), and Disneyland Monorail attractions in Disneyland. Roy O. Disney objected to Walt's creation of the company as he considered it a diversion of a larger portion of the Walt Disney Productions income to Walt's family. WDI charged a licensing fee to the Disney company for 5% to 10% of the income from all of Disney's merchandising deals. [...] In light of objections from Roy {{as well as those}} of potential stockholders, WDI was renamed WED Enterprises (WED) in 1953 based on Walt's initials.|$|R
5|$|The {{attraction}} originated as {{a concept}} created by Walt Disney, who drew inspiration from the ridable miniature Carolwood Pacific Railroad built in his <b>backyard.</b> The Disneyland <b>Railroad</b> first {{opened to the public}} at Disneyland's grand opening on July 17, 1955. Since that time, multiple alterations have been made to its route, including the addition of two large dioramas in the late 1950s and mid-1960s. Several changes have also been made to its rolling stock, including the conversion of one of its train cars into a parlor car in the mid-1970s, and the switch from diesel oil to biodiesel to fuel its locomotives in the late 2000s.|$|R
5000|$|The Emma Nevada, a [...] {{narrow gauge}} Baldwin Locomotive Works 2-6-0 [...] "Mogul" [...] steam {{locomotive}} built in 1881, {{was purchased by}} Disney animator Ward Kimball and his wife Betty for their <b>backyard</b> Grizzly Flats <b>Railroad</b> in 1938. Originally built for the short-line Nevada Central Railway connecting Battle Mountain with Austin, the beautifully restored locomotive features Kimball's own artwork on the cab and headlight and was finally fired up in 1942. Boiler problems permanently sidelined the Emma Nevada in 1951. Kimball donated the locomotive to the museum {{and it can be}} seen today in the museum's Grizzly Flats car barn. The love of trains that Kimball shared with Walt Disney and fellow animator Ollie Johnston is credited with the idea of building a railroad in Disneyland in Anaheim, California. At Disneyland, a restored 1902 Baldwin [...] narrow gauge locomotive has been named after Kimball. The Ward Kimball, which entered service on June 26, 2005, is the first locomotive added to the Disneyland Railroad since 1959. The Chloe, a [...] narrow gauge Baldwin Locomotive Works 0-4-2T steam locomotive built in 1883, was also previously owned by Kimball and is displayed next to the Emma Nevada. Both are not operational; however, a diesel switcher is used to move the locomotives up and down the museum's short segment of [...] narrow gauge track on select days. On July 28, 2017, the Chloe and its train car made an appearance at the media preview for the reopening of the Disneyland Railroad. They were pulled along its new route by the Justi Creek Railway's Marie E. locomotive driven by John Lasseter. The OERM plans to restore the Chloe to operating condition.|$|R

5000|$|Ollie's lifelong hobby was {{live steam}} trains. Starting in 1949, he built the [...] gauge La Cañada Valley Railroad, a {{miniature}} <b>backyard</b> <b>railroad</b> with three 1:12-scale locomotives {{at his home}} in Flintridge, California. [...] The locomotives are now owned by his sons. This railroad was one of the inspirations for Walt Disney to build his own <b>backyard</b> <b>railroad,</b> the Carolwood Pacific Railroad, which inspired the building of the railroad in Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Ollie was a founding Governor of the Carolwood Pacific Historical Society along with his fellow Disney animator and railfan, Ward Kimball.

5000|$|Involvement {{ranges from}} {{possession}} of a train set to spending hours and {{large sums of money}} on a large and exacting model of a railroad and the scenery through which it passes, called a [...] "layout".

5000|$|A <b>backyard</b> <b>railroad</b> is {{a privately}} owned, outdoor railroad, {{most often in}} miniature, but large enough for one or several persons to ride on. The rail gauge can be {{anything}} from [...] to [...] or more. Smaller backyard or outdoor railroads that cannot be ridden are called garden railroads.

50|$|Live steam (and other self-propelled) {{locomotives}} {{are made}} {{in a range of}} sizes, or scales, according to track gauge. The smaller gauges, sometimes called 'garden gauges' because they can be set up in the owner's own garden, or in the US called a <b>backyard</b> <b>railroad,</b> are sufficient to run by themselves but usually cannot haul the driver or passengers. The larger gauges are usually found on club tracks or miniature railways, and are intended to haul the driver and passengers.|$|E
5000|$|Ridable, {{large-scale}} {{live steam}} railroading on a <b>backyard</b> <b>railroad</b> {{is a popular}} aspect of the live steam hobby, but it is time-consuming to build a locomotive from scratch {{and it can be}} costly to purchase one already built. Garden railways, in smaller scales (that cannot pull a [...] "live" [...] person nor be ridden on), offer the benefits of real steam engines (and at lower cost and in less space), but do not provide the same experience as operating one's own locomotive in the larger scales and riding on (or behind) it, while doing so.|$|E
50|$|In 1949, Disney and {{his family}} moved to a new home in the Holmby Hills {{district}} of Los Angeles. With the help of his friends Ward and Betty Kimball, who already had their own <b>backyard</b> <b>railroad,</b> Disney developed blueprints and immediately set to work on creating a miniature live steam railroad for his backyard. The name of the railroad, Carolwood Pacific Railroad, came from his home's location on Carolwood Drive. The miniature working steam locomotive was built by Disney Studios engineer Roger E. Broggie, and Disney named it Lilly Belle after his wife; after three years Disney ordered it into storage due to a series of accidents involving his guests.|$|E
50|$|In 1950, Walt Disney {{began to}} build the Carolwood Pacific Railroad, a {{miniature}} railroad in his backyard. Walt saw a photo of 173 and decided to build a model of it for his railroad. Southern Pacific draftsman David L. Joslyn located the specifications of 173 in a warehouse of SP's old records, and recreated the 173's drawings scaled down to two inches to one foot. This engine operated {{for a few years}} in Walt's <b>backyard</b> <b>railroad,</b> and when it was shut down, the 173 model was displayed in Disneyland's Main Street station for nearly fifty years, before moving to the new Walt Disney Family Museum, dedicated to Disney's legacy.|$|E
5000|$|By 1948, Walt Disney's {{interest}} in model trains was evolving into an {{interest in}} larger, ridable miniature trains after observing the trains and <b>backyard</b> <b>railroad</b> layouts of several hobbyists including Disney animator Ollie Johnston. In 1949, after purchasing 5 acre of vacant land in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, he started construction on a new residence {{for himself and his}} family, and on the elaborate [...] gauge ridable miniature Carolwood Pacific Railroad behind it. The railroad featured a set of freight cars pulled by the Lilly Belle, a 1:8-scale live steam locomotive named after Disney's wife Lillian and built by the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop team led by Roger E.

5000|$|A garden railway's scale {{tends to}} be in the range of 1/32 (Gauge 1) to 1/12 (1:12), running on either [...] or [...] gauge track. 1/32 scale (1:32) is also called [...] "three-eighths scale" [...] meaning 3/8 of an inch on the model {{represents}} one foot on the real thing. For similar reasons, 1/24 scale (1:24) is also called [...] "half-inch scale". Other popular scales are 1:29, 1:20.3 (representing [...] gauge prototypes on [...] track, 16 mm (1:19). They are smaller than the <b>Backyard</b> <b>railroad,</b> or what is commonly called a miniature railway, and would not provide a ride-on facility, being intended instead as a display railway. Smaller scales and gauges are used in the garden, but in general garden railway is used to refer to the medium scale sizes which would be impractical to use indoors.|$|E

5000|$|The modern, {{streamlined}} trains {{were placed}} into service {{to represent the}} future of rail travel, {{in contrast to the}} steam-powered DRR which represented its past. Motive power for each train consisted of an integral head-end unit driven by a Chevrolet 265 cu in (4.3 L) displacement V8 gasoline engine, mated to a Jeep transfer case powering drive-shafts to both the front and rear wheel trucks. Two 1954 Oldsmobile 88 2-dr coupes furnished the windscreen, doors and instrument console for each of the two 5,000 lb locomotives. The attraction operated until September 30, 1958 when construction began on the Matterhorn and Submarine Voyage. The Disneyland Monorail System ultimately took the place of the Viewliner in June 1959, thereby {{making it one of the}} shortest-lived rides in the park's history.
