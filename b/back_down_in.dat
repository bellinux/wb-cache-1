5|$|In {{his next}} fight, Margarito moved up in weight class for a rematch with Daniel Santos, who possessed the WBO junior welterweight title. The fight {{took place on}} September 11, 2004 and ended in a {{technical}} decision victory for Santos after Margarito was cut over the right eye by an unintentional headbutt in round six. After round nine it was ruled Margarito could not continue, so the fight was decided on the scorecards and Santos led 8685, 8784 on two cards while Margarito was ahead 8685 on the third scorecard. After the loss, Margarito moved <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> weight to defend his WBO welterweight title against Sebastian Lujan on February 18, 2005. He won the fight by technical knockout in the tenth round {{and set up a}} fight against Kermit Cintron, who was in attendance for Margarito's fight with Lujan. On April 23, 2005, Margarito defeated the less experienced Cintron, knocking him down four times en route to a technical knockout victory in the fifth round at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. Margarito's next fight took place on February 18, 2006, when he defeated Manuel Gomez by technical knockout in just 74seconds in Las Vegas.|$|E
5|$|Initially other {{villages in}} the area, chiefly Mattau, Soulang and Bakloan, also professed their desire {{to live in peace}} with the Dutch. The villages saw that it was in their {{interest}} to maintain good relations with the newcomers, but this belief was weakened by a series of incidents between 1625 and 1629. The earliest of these was a Dutch attack on Chinese pirates in the bay of Wancan, not far from Mattau, in 1625. The pirates were able to drive off the Dutch soldiers, causing the Dutch to lose face among the Formosan villages. Encouraged by this Dutch failure, warriors from Mattau raided Sinkan, believing the Dutch too weak to defend their Formosan friends. At this point, the Dutch returned to Wancan and this time were able to rout the pirates, restoring their reputation. Mattau was then forced by the colonials to return the property stolen from Sinkan and make reparations in the form of two pigs. The peace was short-lived, however, because in November 1626 the villagers of Sinkan attacked Mattau and Bakloan, before going to the Dutch to ask for protection from retribution. Although the Dutch were able to force Sinkan's enemies to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> this case, in later incidents they proved incapable of fully protecting their Formosan allies.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} to Battle Mountain and P'il-bong {{was much more}} difficult from the east, the American-held side, than from the west, the North Korean side. On the east side there was no road climbing halfway to the top; {{from the base of}} the mountain at the edge of the Haman valley the only way to make the ascent was by foot trail. Climbers took two to three hours to reach the top of P'il-bong from the reservoir area, and required from three to four hours to get on top of Battle Mountain from the valley floor. The turnaround time for supply trains to Battle Mountain was six hours. Often a dispatch runner required eight hours to go up Battle Mountain and come <b>back</b> <b>down.</b> <b>In</b> some places the trail was so steep that climbers had to set up ropes to hold along the side of the trail. North Korean night patrols constantly cut telephone lines. The wire men had a difficult and dangerous job trying to maintain wire communication with units on the mountain. Food, water and ammunition were frequently short for the units at the tops of the peaks.|$|E

The club managed to bounce straight back however, winning the Serie D championship and achieving promotion back into C. After a few decent seasons in the upper parts of the table, relegation struck Messina again. In the 1979 season Serie C2 was formed and Messina were placed into it.|$|E

25|$|In 1936 {{the fascist}} regime forced Palermo {{to change its}} colours to yellow and red, after the {{official}} ones of the local municipality. Meanwhile, economical troubles arose: causing even {{the imposition of a}} 10 lire meat tax in an attempt to finance the club. However Palermo's fourth season for <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the league was a troublesome one, as in 1940 it was expelled by the Italian Football Federation because of financial problems. A merger with Unione Sportiva Juventina Palermo brought to the foundation of Unione Sportiva Palermo-Juventina, which entered Serie C in 1941 and played with light blue colours. In 1942 the club returned to Serie B and switched back to its original colours. In 1943, however, chairman Beppe Agnello was forced to retire the club from the league following the World War II events.|$|E
25|$|During the 1994–95 season, Genoa were {{narrowly}} relegated; {{they finished}} level on points with Padova after the normal season period. This meant a relegation play-out {{was to be}} played between the two in Florence. The game was tied 1–1 at full-time {{and went to a}} penalty shootout. Genoa eventually lost the shoot-out 5–4. While <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> Serie B, the club had another taste of international cup success when they became the final winners of the Anglo-Italian Cup by beating Port Vale 5–2 with Gennaro Ruotolo scoring a hat-trick. Chairman Spinelli sold Genoa in 1997, moving onto other clubs (Alessandria and, currently Livorno). The late 1990s and early 2000s would be the most trying {{time in the history of}} the club, with constantly changing managers, a poor financial situation and little hope of gaining promotion, outside of a decent 6th-place finish in 1999–00.

25|$|Maldini-led Parma beat Triestina 3–1 after {{extra time}} in a {{play-off}} match, thanks to two goals from a young Carlo Ancelotti, who moved to Roma that summer after his starring role. However, they only lasted a season in Serie B and began the 1980s <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> Serie C. In 1982–83, Massimo Barbuti arrived at Parma, a player who is still referred today as l'idolo della Nord, or the idol of the North. He was so called for his popularity amongst those sitting in the Curva Nord, where Parma's staunchest fans have historically sat during home matches at the Tardini. Parma returned to Serie B as champions after winning their division in 1984 with 18 goals from Barbuti and final day victory over San Remo with Juventus-bound Stefano Poli scoring the only goal of the game. Il Ducalis stay in Serie B was shorter than hoped as they spent just one season in the league, finishing third from bottom and being relegated as a result. The disappointment led to the departure of cult hero Barbuti, a striker who scored 37 league goals in 98 appearances in just three years for the club and was loved by the fans for his tireless running, goalscoring record and manic celebrations in front of – and sometimes in — the Curva Nord at the Stadio Ennio Tardini.|$|E
