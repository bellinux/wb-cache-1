40|$|Abstract. Basing on {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of}} the existing <b>backwashing</b> modes of Biological Aerated Filter (BAF), air and water combined <b>backwashing</b> was taken as the most efficient and economic mode for BAF <b>backwashing</b> in this study to ensure operating stability and <b>backwashing</b> effect. Then the relevant parameters, involved in air flushing, air and water combined washing and water rinsing, were optimized reasonably. In this paper, the optimal <b>backwashing</b> control strategy was recommended as follows: air <b>backwashing</b> 3 minutes with air <b>backwashing</b> intensity of 10 L/m 2 ·s， secondly, air and water combined <b>backwashing</b> 3 minutes with both air and water <b>backwashing</b> intensity of 10 L/m 2 ·s，at last，water rinsing for 9 minutes with water rinsing intensity of 10 L/m 2 ·s. To discuss the influence of <b>backwashing</b> process on treatment efficiency of BAF, the changes of headloss and contaminants concentration of BAF before and after <b>backwashing</b> was also investigated in this study. The experimental results revealed that under the optimal <b>backwashing</b> control strategy the water flux could be recovered soon after <b>backwashing.</b> Although the contaminants concentration in initial filtrated water increased slightly, the treatment efficiency of BAF reactors could be back to normal in 2 hours...|$|R

The microbial groups revealed new distribution along the biofilter depth after {{low flow rate}} <b>backwashing</b> for a short time. Then the start-up process was accelerated by <b>backwashing.</b> The biomass profile and microbial activity profile both varying with depth before and after <b>backwashing,</b> can be mathematically described by quadratic equations. Using the profiles, the difference of oxygen demand can be calculated to determine the airflow rate during <b>backwashing.</b> Combined with the difference between biofilters and rapid gravity filters, analysis of biomass and microbial activity can determine more accurately the required airflow rate during <b>backwashing...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Backwashing</b> using {{ozonated water}} was {{investigated}} to control fouling during direct sewer mining using a ceramic microfiltration (MF) membrane. Primarily treated municipal wastewater was filtered and <b>backwashing</b> was performed using RO filtered tap water in this study. Direct MF filtration in the dead-end filtration mode using the ceramic MF membrane resulted in fouling {{that could not}} be fully removed by conventional <b>backwashing.</b> A steady increase in transmembrane pressure (TMP) was observed after each filtration cycle and could be attributed mostly to cake formation. In contrast, <b>backwashing</b> using ozonated water for 2. 5 min was effective at removing the fouling cake layer; thus, resulting in a stable TMP value after multiple filtration cycles. The effectiveness of ozonated water <b>backwashing</b> could be enhanced by extending the <b>backwashing</b> time. Indeed, the permeability of a heavily fouled membrane was fully restored after 3. 5 min of ozonated water <b>backwashing.</b> Results reported here suggest that <b>backwashing</b> using ozonated water has the ability to remove most foulants deposited on the membrane surface and can be used for sewer mining, where severe cake formation occurs...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of demineralized water <b>backwashing</b> on fouling by different fractions of NOM {{was investigated in}} this study.

LC-OCD analyses showed both UF permeate and demineralized water <b>backwashes</b> were effective on removing part of biopolymers, but demineralized water is also effective for humic substances and a limited amount of low molecular weight substances. However, based on the LC-OCD results, even demineralized water <b>backwashing</b> is not effective to remove all humic substances and biopolymers rejected on the UF membranes. © 2012 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|<b>Backwashing</b> is an {{important}} operation employed to remove filtered solids as this build up causes resistance to filtration to increase with time. <b>Backwashing</b> involves inverting the direction of liquid flow while using clean liquid. This process is employed for times {{in the range of}} 5-15 minutes with typical flow rates per unit area in the range of 6.8- 13.6 L/m2.s. Most designs typically employ <b>backwashing</b> once per day of operation.The operation of depth filters is inherently cyclic due to the necessity of solids removal build up during the process, as such two or more units are typically used so that <b>backwashing</b> does not interfere with the filtration. Effective <b>backwashing</b> occurs when the filter medium is fluidized. Fluidization flow rates generally fall in the range of 20-50 gpm/ft2.|$|R

2500|$|Sir Thomas Smith, the Secretary of State for Queen Elizabeth wrote [...] "De Republica Anglorum" [...] in 1583. In it he {{set forth}} the truly fearful {{powers of the}} Crown and Parliament, which can make and unmake law, change rights and {{possessions}} of private men, legitimate bastards, establish religions, condemn or absolve (by attainders) whomever the Prince wills. Smith was no advocate of tyranny, but he clearly enjoyed enumerating an imposing list of powers of the Tudor state. In Bracton, on the other hand, the emphasis was not upon {{the power of the}} Crown, but in responsibility. The monarch was subject to God, to the law of the land, and to his feudal court. In Bracton, the king owed some responsibility to listen to his lords. (Recall that Bracton had observed and experienced the turmoil from the Barons' War, and lived in the <b>backwash</b> of the problems of John.) Bracton's writings became a de facto antidote to the absolutism of the Tudors and the Stuarts. Bracton brought an air of clarity, from his study of Roman order, to the confusion that followed the English Reformation. The anonymous re-publisher of Bracton recommends him as worthy of emulation, since the other books of the day were [...] "indigesta confusio". The law under Elizabeth was medieval. The trend of the day was toward Romanism. Bracton was popular in the time of Elizabeth because he was available through the printing press. In later times, he was read because he was Roman.

The pilot MBR was fed with real municipal wastewater and the filtration flux, <b>backwashing</b> interval, aeration frequency and temperature 11 were varied. A filtration flux below 25 l/m(2) h is generally recommended, at below this flux, the MBR operated at sub-critical flux conditions, the filter cake was minimized and membrane fouling was mainly attributed to the membrane pore blocking. Moreover, the membrane fouling, at below 25 l/m(2) h, was more reversible to backwashing; above this value, <b>backwashing</b> became less efficient to clean the membrane. Less frequent <b>backwashing</b> (e. g. 600 s filtration/ 45 s <b>backwashing)</b> decreased the amount of fouling irreversible to <b>backwashing</b> and its performance was superior to that of frequent <b>backwashing</b> (e. g. 200 s filtration/ 15 s <b>backwashing).</b> The MBR suffered more fouling at low temperature conditions (e. g. at 13 - 14 degrees C) than at high temperature conditions (e. g. at 17 - 18 degrees C).
