25|$|The first all-new Pontiac models {{appeared}} in 1949. They incorporated styling cues such as lower <b>body</b> <b>lines</b> and rear fenders that were integrated in the rear-end styling of the car.|$|E
25|$|Acro dancers {{commonly}} wear flexible, form-fitting {{clothing for}} both safety and aesthetic reasons. Form-fitting clothing is preferred over loose clothing because the latter {{does not move}} synchronously with the body and thus may interfere with a dancer's ability to maintain control. This is especially important when a dancer is performing tricks, as loss of control can lead to serious injury. Aside from the safety aspect, form-fitting clothing also helps to expose a dancer's <b>body</b> <b>lines,</b> which can add significantly to the visual impact of an acro dance performance.|$|E
25|$|The new car {{featured}} a more prominent long hood short deck styling, and was longer lower and {{wider than the}} 1969 models. The roofline was lower, while all models now {{featured a}} much less formal roof line than previous years. The windshield rake was increased, and the SportsRoof models had an even flatter fastback roofline. The overall styling appeared much more aerodynamic than years previous, and featured a pointed front end. The grille covered the full width of the front fascia, and surrounded the quad headlights. The front fender line extended to front door, sloping downward and gradually disappearing in the quarter panel. Both front and rear bumpers were slim tight fitting chromed units, that carefully followed the <b>body</b> <b>lines.</b> The taillights were situated in the rear panel above the bumper, and were now long rectangular units with rounded outer edges.|$|E

25|$|In November 1961, Knudsen {{had moved}} to Chevrolet. Pete Estes now became general manager of Pontiac and Delorean was {{promoted}} to Pontiac Chief engineer. Both continued Knudsen's work of making Pontiac a performance-car brand. Pontiac capitalized on the emerging trend toward sportier bucket-seat coupes in 1962 by introducing the Grand Prix, taking {{the place of the}} Ventura which now became a trim option on the Catalina. Although GM officially ended factory support for all racing activities across all of its brands in January 1963, Pontiac continued to cater to performance car enthusiasts by making larger engines with more power available across all model lines. For 1963, the Grand Prix received the same styling changes as other full-sized Pontiacs such as vertical headlights and crisper <b>body</b> <b>lines,</b> but also received its own squared-off roof-line with a concave rear window, along with less chrome. This concave rear window would be duplicated on all Tempest/LeMans four-door intermediates in 1964-1965.|$|E
500|$|The {{composition}} is pyramidal. The figure reclining at left leads the viewer's {{eye to the}} seated figure, whose gesture in turn points to Godley {{at the apex of}} the compositional pyramid. The diving figure at right leads to the swimming form of Eakins, who painted himself into the scene and whose leftward movement directs attention back into the painting. Eakins enforces this pyramidal structure by manipulating the focus of the painting: the center area containing the swimmers is extremely precise, while the outer areas are diffuse, with [...] "virtually no moderating zones in between". The lighting within the picture is unnatural—too bright in some places, and too dark in others—although the effect, which tends to accentuate the <b>body</b> <b>lines</b> of the swimmers, is generally subtle.|$|E
500|$|Albini's name {{does not}} appear on the {{original}} record sleeve. The booklet's photographs were taken in {{one day at a}} pub opposite the 4AD offices, because, according to Larbalestier, [...] "it {{was one of the few}} places that had a raised stage". In an 1988 interview with Joy Press, Black Francis described the concept as referring to [...] "a surfer girl," [...] who [...] "walks along the Beach of Binones, has a surfboard, very beautiful." [...] When questioned about the topless element, he replied, [...] "For the first record, I told them I liked nudity. I like body lines—not necessarily something in bad taste, didn't even have to be female, just <b>body</b> <b>lines...</b> like that Obsession ad, you know?" [...] According to Melody Maker, the album was originally entitled [...] "Gigantic" [...] after Deal's song, but the band feared misinterpretation of the cover and changed it to [...] "Surfer Rosa." [...] The [...] "name" [...] of the cover woman, and the album title, comes from the [...] "Oh My Golly!" [...] lyric, [...] "Besando chichando con surfer rosa." ...|$|E

500|$|Development of the second-generation LS 400 {{began after}} {{worldwide}} {{launch of the}} first generation under program code 250T. Given the first-generation model's successful reception and high level of customer satisfaction with its design, replicating the original LS 400's attributes with its successor was one of chief engineer Kazuo Okamoto's primary goals (he stated that [...] "a tradition cannot be founded if you reject the first generation"). Externally, the most significant change was an increase in wheelbase length of , resulting in more interior space and an additional [...] of rear-seat legroom. However, as the overall length remained the same, trunk capacity was slightly reduced. The more aerodynamic body (C'd 0.28) retained the general profile and contours of the original LS 400 and was the work of the Calty Design Research center in the U.S. Designers had evaluated 20 competing concepts, including several with a radically changed body, before selecting a winning entry in 1991 that included forms and contours similar to the original LS 400. Upon final approval in 1992, an evolutionary redesign was the ultimate result, with new design features consisting of sharper angles, curved <b>body</b> <b>lines,</b> and a beveled grille. More prominent side lines provided a reference point for parking maneuvers, and forward visibility was improved. Production development lasted from 1991 until conclusion {{in the second quarter of}} 1994.|$|E
2500|$|Two of Dreyer's {{most visible}} sculptures are {{the pair of}} lionesses {{in front of the}} Kansas City Life Insurance building, located at 3520 Broadway. Dreyer viewed lions at morning and evening hours at the Swope Park Zoo, now named the Kansas City Zoo, and chose the lioness because it did not have the mane to hide the fluid <b>body</b> <b>lines.</b> [...] He {{preferred}} to see the lions moving, as that gave him more visibility into their muscle structures. [...] Flaws were found in the cast of one of the lionesses and had to be re-cast three times. [...] This caused delays in the sculpture schedule, and the building was dedicated in 1924 without the sculptures. [...] The lionesses were carved in pink, black and white granite and were installed on April 6, 1925.|$|E
2500|$|The 1969 Caprice {{and other}} {{full-sized}} Chevrolets were restyled with new <b>body</b> <b>lines</b> and front bumpers that {{wrapped around the}} grille (again with optional concealed headlights, for which headlight washers could be added as a new [...] "one year only" [...] option) along with ventless front windows on all models. The [...] wheelbase, inner bodyshell and framework were carried over from the 1965 model. The station wagon was renamed the Kingswood Estate and continued to use exterior wood grain trim along with [...] the interior trim of the Caprice sedans and coupes. Front seat headrests were now standard equipment to meet federal safety standards and the ignition switch moved from the dashboard to the steering column and also locked the steering wheel when the key was removed. This {{was part of a}} Federal mandate for the 1970 models, but introduced a year earlier on all General Motors cars except the Corvair.|$|E

50|$|Notable {{features}} on the Mustang GT include 20-inch wheels, a nose which leans forward, and a side scoop. For {{the first time in}} the Mustang's nearly 40-year existence, the scoop is a fully integrated design element that creates a triangular opening, and flows forward along the chamfered lower <b>body</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The 1974 {{model year}} {{introduced}} an aerodynamically styled fastback coupe with pronounced [...] "tunneled" [...] headlight surrounds. The Matador coupe {{was the only}} all-new model in the popular mid-size car segment, specifically targeting the Chevrolet Chevelle Coupe, Ford Torino Coupe and Plymouth Satellite Sebring. The coupe was designed {{under the direction of}} AMC's vice president of styling, Richard A. Teague, with input from Mark Donohue, the famous race car driver. AMC's styling department had greater freedom because of a decision to design the new Matador strictly as a coupe, without the constraints of attempting to have the sedan and station wagon versions fit the same <b>body</b> <b>lines.</b> Reportedly Teague designed the coupe's front as an homage to one of the first AMCs he designed, the 1964 Rambler American. Many were amazed that AMC came up with the fast, stylish Matador, considering the automaker's size and limited resources.|$|E
2500|$|For 1969, the big Chevrolet {{was totally}} redesigned, {{given a new}} length, new fender and <b>body</b> <b>lines,</b> and a new front and back end, but {{continued}} using the basic 1965 chassis, innerbody structure and even the rooflines of pillared two- and four-door sedans. The cars also remained on the [...] wheelbase, but grew to a new length of , while the wagons grew [...] to a new length of 217.7 Engine offerings included a standard 250 cubic-inch six-cylinder and 235-horsepower 327 V-8, and optional V-8 engines included two 350s of 255 and 300 horsepower, a 396 rated at 265 horsepower and three 427 V8s , , and [...] This was the final year for the Bel Air 2-door sedan and the Bel Air-based station wagon was renamed Townsman, {{as part of a}} Chevrolet move to revert to the pre-1962 practice of using different nameplates on station wagons than other models. Three- and four-speed manual transmissions were again offered along with the two-speed Powerglide automatic with the six-cylinder, and 327 and 350 V-8s; and the three-speed Turbo Hydramatic, offered only with the big-block V-8s since its 1965 introduction, was now available with all engines.|$|E
2500|$|The 1967 {{model year}} saw the {{introduction}} for the Pontiac Firebird pony car, {{a variant of}} the Chevrolet Camaro that was the brand's answer to the hot-selling Ford Mustang. Intermediate sized cars (Tempest, LeMans, GTO) were mildly face-lifted but all full size cars and GTO lost their Tri-Power engine option though it did get a larger 400 cubic-inch V8 that replaced the previous 389. Full-sized cars got a major facelift with rounder wasp-waisted <b>body</b> <b>lines,</b> a name change for the mid-line series from Star Chief to Executive and a one-year-only Grand Prix convertible. 1968 introduced the Endura 'rubber' front bumper on the GTO, the precursor to modern cars' integrated bumpers, and {{the first of a series}} [...] "Ram Air" [...] engines, which featured the induction of cold air to the carburetor(s) for more power, and took away some of the sting from deleting the famous Tri-Power multiple carburetion option from the engine line up. This Tri carburetor deletion came from the 14th floor of GM banning multiple carburetion and headed by GM president Ed Cole. The Ram Air V garnered much auto press publicity, but only a relative few were made available for sale. Full-sized cars and intermediates reverted from vertical to horizontal headlights while the sporty/performance 2+2 was dropped from the lineup.|$|E

2500|$|The 1967 Caprice {{received}} a restyling with more rounded <b>body</b> <b>lines</b> and revised grilles and taillights, optional front fender corner lamps which illuminated with the headlamps, {{as well as}} a revised instrument panel with round instruments and a new steering wheel. Taillight lenses were all red as the backup lights were relocated into the rear bumper, unlike in the lesser full-size models that had their backup lamps {{in the center of the}} taillights. A dual-master brake cylinder was now included, while front disc brakes were optional. Other new options included a stereo 8-track tape player, power door locks, and a fiber optic exterior light monitoring system. The same seating selections continued as before with revisions to trim patterns plus the new addition of all-vinyl upholstery as a no-cost option for conventional and Strato bench seats in sedans and coupes. Engines and transmission offerings were carried over from the previous year. The exception was the optional [...] Turbo Jet V8 was no longer listed, leaving the [...] 427 as the top engine. The three-speed Turbo Hydramatic transmission that previously only available with the [...] and [...] V8s was now optional with the [...] Turbo Fire V8. As with all 1967 cars sold in the U.S., Caprices featured occupant protection safety features that included an energy-absorbing steering column, soft or recessed interior control knobs, and front outboard shoulder belt anchors.|$|E
