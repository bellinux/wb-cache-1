25|$|In the Hellsing manga {{series by}} Kouta Hirano, {{one of the}} {{depicted}} Nazis is an artificial catboy named Schrödinger. He claims that he is everywhere and nowhere at the same time, {{which is similar to}} the cat being alive and dead at the same time. It is also said that he can only exist as long as he is aware of himself. In the second anime adaption, he eventually allows himself to be absorbed by the vampire Alucard, which causes his awareness to <b>be</b> <b>clouded.</b> This then spreads to Alucard, who vanishes for thirty years. Alucard returns after destroying the millions of souls within himself, giving him access to all of Schrödinger's abilities.|$|E
2500|$|While male {{prisoners were}} {{often used in}} single studies, so {{that the results of}} the {{experimentation}} on them would not <b>be</b> <b>clouded</b> by other variables, women were sometimes used in bacteriological or physiological experiments, sex experiments, and as the victims of sex crimes. The testimony of a unit member that served as guard graphically demonstrated this reality:"One of the former researchers I located told me that one day he had a human experiment scheduled, but there was still time to kill. So he and another unit member took the keys to the cells and opened one that housed a Chinese woman. One of the unit members raped her; the other member took the keys and opened another cell. There was a Chinese woman in there who had been used in a frostbite experiment. She had several fingers missing and her bones were black, with gangrene set in. He was about to rape her anyway, then he saw that her sex organ was festering, with pus oozing to the surface. He gave up the idea, left and locked the door, then later went on to his experimental work." ...|$|E

60|$|But Clementina looked with home-sick eyes at {{the strangeness}} of the alien scene: the pale, low heaven which seemed not to <b>be</b> <b>clouded</b> and yet was so dim; the flat shores with the little {{railroad}} trains running in and out over them; the grimy bulks of the city, and the shipping in the river, sparse and sombre after the gay forest of sails and stacks at New York.|$|E
60|$|During {{all these}} melancholy {{experiences}} so significant {{of the dying}} border, I had the comfort of my undaunted wife whose happy spirit refused to <b>be</b> <b>clouded</b> by what she recognized as merely the natural decay of the preceding generation.

She refused to yield her youthful right to happiness, and {{under the influence of}} her serene philosophy I went back to my writing, or at least to the serious consideration of another mountain theme, which was taking shape in my brain.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 72 mm. The wings are very pale grey, {{with a slight}} cinnamon tinge. The forewings have a slightly curved brown median line and an oblique straight postmedian line not reaching quite to the costa. Beyond this, the wing <b>is</b> <b>clouded</b> with cinnamon, {{and there is a}} submarginal row of nine indefinite internervular grey spots, broken outwards below the sixth. There is also a brown spot in the cell pupilled with white, and the median area <b>is</b> somewhat <b>clouded</b> with cinnamon. The hindwings have a postmedian brown line across the wing and a series of eight grey internervular spots that are more prominent on the underside. The central area <b>is</b> <b>clouded</b> with cinnamon.|$|R
6000|$|And {{stranger}} still, {{it happened}} to be before that very same curtain that many years later I myself stepped forth to make my first bow as a playwright. I saw the house but dimly, for on such occasion one's vision is apt to <b>be</b> <b>clouded.</b> All that I saw clearly was in the front row of the second circle--a sweet face laughing though the tears were in her eyes; and she waved to me a handkerchief. And on one side of her stood a gallant gentleman with merry eyes who shouted [...] "Bravo!" [...] and on the other a dreamy-looking lad; but he appeared disappointed, having expected better work from me. And the fourth face I could not see, for it was turned away from me.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the topmost}} {{chamber of the}} last of a row of somber gray stone houses in Adam Street a girl with a thin but {{beautiful}} face and large, expectant eyes sat close to the bare, uncurtained window, from which it was possible to command a view of the street below. A book which she had apparently been reading had fallen neglected onto the floor. Steadfastly she watched the passers-by. Her delicate, expressive features were more than once illuminated with joy, only to <b>be</b> <b>clouded,</b> a moment later, with disappointment. The color came and went in her cheeks, as though, indeed, she were more sensitive than her years. Occasionally she glanced around at the clock. Time dragged so slowly in that great bare room with its obvious touch of poverty! ...|$|E
60|$|Bob did {{not so much}} mind this, for he {{had ceased}} to regard the time spent with the {{professor}} as lessons. After he had once mastered the conjugation of the verbs, and had learned an extensive vocabulary by heart, books had been laid aside, altogether; and the three hours with the professor had, {{for the last two}} months, been spent simply in conversation. They were no longer indoors, but sat in the garden on the shady side of the house; or, when the sky happened to <b>be</b> <b>clouded</b> and the morning was cool, walked together out to Europa Point; and would sit down there, looking over the sea, but always talking. Sometimes it was history--Roman, English, or Spanish--sometimes Bob's schooldays and life in London, sometimes general subjects. It mattered little what they talked about, so that the conversation was kept up.|$|E

[...] "In {{the first}} place, though I should stay till dark {{there will be}} no arrival; because I feel in my heart, Fate has written it down in to-day's page of her eternal book, that I am not to have the {{pleasure}} I long for. In the second place, if he stepped in this moment, my presence here would be a chagrin to him, and the consciousness that it must be so would turn half my blood to ice. His hand would, perhaps, be loose and chill if I put mine into it; his eye would <b>be</b> <b>clouded</b> if I sought its beam. I should look up for that kindling, something I have seen in past days, when my face, or my language, or my disposition had at some happy moment pleased him; I should discover only darkness. I had better go home." ...|$|E
60|$|The duty of {{the vessel}} went on as usual. The night promised to <b>be</b> <b>clouded,</b> but not very dark, as there was a moon. When Spike ordered the anchor-watches, he had great care to spare his crew as much as possible, {{for the next day}} was likely to be one of great toil to them. He {{intended}} to get the schooner up again, if possible; and though he might not actually pump her out so as to cause her to float, enough water was to be removed to enable him to get at the doubloons. The situation of the bread-locker was known, {{and as soon as the}} cabin was sufficiently freed from water to enable one to move about in it, Spike did not doubt his being able to get at the gold. With his resources and ingenuity, the matter in his own mind was reduced to one of toil and time. Eight-and-forty hours, and some hard labour, he doubted not would effect all he cared for.|$|E
60|$|The boy was silenced, though {{exceedingly}} {{reluctant to}} admit that any ship could equal his own. In the mean time, there was every appearance {{of a change in}} the weather. Just about the time the Plantagenet braced up, the wind freshened, and in ten minutes it blew a stiff breeze. Some time before the admiral spoke the vessels outside, he was compelled to take in all his light canvass; and when he filled, again, after giving his orders to the frigate and sloop, the topgallant sheets were let fly, a single reef was taken in the top-sails, and the lighter sails were set over them. This change in the weather, more especially as the night threatened to <b>be</b> <b>clouded,</b> if not absolutely dark, would necessarily bring about a corresponding change in the plan of sailing, reducing the intervals between the departures of the vessels, quite one-half. To such vicissitudes are all maritime operations liable, and it is fortunate when there is sufficient capacity in the leaders to remedy them.|$|E
