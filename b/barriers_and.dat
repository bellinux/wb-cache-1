5|$|A {{section of}} Highway427 between Campus Road-Fasken Drive and Steeles Avenue is being {{expanded}} to four lanes {{in each direction}} as of 2015. This project includes the installation of high-mast lighting, median <b>barriers,</b> <b>and</b> the addition of high-occupancy toll lanes in both directions, and is scheduled for completion {{in the autumn of}} 2017.|$|E
5|$|Another {{significant}} human {{impact is}} roadkill—dead turtles, especially females, are commonly seen on summer roads. In addition to direct killing, roads genetically isolate some populations. Localities {{have tried to}} limit roadkill by constructing underpasses, highway <b>barriers,</b> <b>and</b> crossing signs. Oregon has introduced public education on turtle awareness, safe swerving, and safely assisting turtles across the road.|$|E
5|$|Following Franklin's retirement, she {{and several}} other retired female faculty members filed a class action lawsuit against the University of Toronto {{claiming}} it had been unjustly enriched by paying women faculty less than comparably qualified men. In 2002, the lawsuit was settled when the university acknowledged that many of its female professors had suffered from gender <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> pay discrimination during their careers. As a result, about 60 retired women faculty received a pay equity settlement intended to compensate them for the lower salaries and pensions they had received.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. W 81 Block {{is located}} in the {{northern}} end of central uplift in Dongpu Sag and is a deep part of the Weicheng Oilfield structure. By detailed core observation and analysis of logging data characteristics, we can identify two main types of <b>barrier</b> <b>and</b> interlayer in Sha- 4 Formation, including muddy <b>barrier</b> <b>and</b> interlayer and gray interlayer. This article describes the distribution characteristics of the <b>barrier</b> <b>and</b> interlayer from three aspects: plane, crosswell profile and well group distribution. The corresponding three-dimensional distribution model of the <b>barrier</b> <b>and</b> interlayer based on structural model has been constructed, which reflects the distribution rule across the <b>barrier</b> <b>and</b> interlayer and help to guide internal dig potential development of the low permeability oilfield...|$|R

It will be shown that for given dimensions of the potential <b>barrier</b> <b>and</b> the real part of the potential, resonant transmission probability approaches infinity for only one positive value of the imaginary part of the potential...|$|R
5|$|In {{preparations}} {{for his next}} campaign, Germanicus sent Publius Vitellius and Gaius Antius to collect taxes in Gaul, and instructed Silius, Anteius, and Caecina to build a fleet. A fort on the Lippe called Castra Aliso was besieged, but the attackers dispersed on sight of Roman reinforcements. The Germans destroyed the nearby mound and altar dedicated to his father Drusus, but he had them both restored and celebrated funerary games with his legions {{in honor of his}} father. New <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> earthworks were put in place, securing the area between Fort Aliso and the Rhine.|$|E
5|$|Two {{provisions}} require certain jurisdictions {{to provide}} election materials to voters in multiple languages: Section 4(f)(4) and Section 203(c). A jurisdiction covered by either provision must provide all materials {{related to an}} election—such as voter registration materials, ballots, notices, and instructions—in the language of any applicable language minority group residing in the jurisdiction. Language minority groups protected by these provisions include Asian Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Native Alaskans. Congress enacted the provisions to break down language <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> combat pervasive language discrimination against the protected groups.|$|E
5|$|Widening of the Kwinana Freeway with {{an extra}} {{southbound}} lane between Roe Highway and Armadale Road began in mid-2014. The project aims to increase the freeway's reliability, efficiency, and safety, as the current two-lane configuration is subject to {{a large proportion of}} heavy vehicles and severe peak hour congestion. The project also involves the realignment of ramps at Berrigan Drive and Armadale Road, construction of noise <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> noise walls where required, and installation of components for intelligent transport systems – optic fibre communications, vehicle detection devices, and closed circuit cameras.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} the ship arrived in Leningrad, only the two forward gun turrets had been {{installed}} and the bridge superstructure was incomplete. The only secondary guns installed were the 3.7cm anti-aircraft guns. The Soviet Navy renamed the ship Petropavlovsk on 25 September 1940, and designated the construction effort to complete the ship Projekt 83. The vessel's design {{provided the basis for}} a planned heavy cruiser, designated Projekt 82, although this ship was canceled before work began. Training for the Soviet crew of the ship proved to be contentious; the Soviets wanted their personnel trained in Germany, while the Germans preferred sending instructors to the Soviet Union. Language <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> inexperience with international training missions also hampered the training effort.|$|E
5|$|IMF members {{signed the}} Jamaica Agreement in January 1976, which {{ratified}} {{the end of}} the Bretton Woods system and reoriented the Fund's role in supporting the international monetary system. The agreement officially embraced the flexible exchange rate regimes that emerged after the failure of the Smithsonian Agreement measures. In tandem with floating exchange rates, the agreement endorsed central bank interventions aimed at clearing excessive volatility. The agreement retroactively formalized the abandonment of gold as a reserve instrument and the Fund subsequently demonetized its gold reserves, returning gold to members or selling it to provide poorer nations with relief funding. Developing countries and countries not endowed with oil export resources enjoyed greater access to IMF lending programs as a result. The Fund continued assisting nations experiencing balance of payments deficits and currency crises, but began imposing conditionality on its funding that required countries to adopt policies aimed at reducing deficits through spending cuts and tax increases, reducing protective trade <b>barriers,</b> <b>and</b> contractionary monetary policy.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Rindt {{switched}} to Formula Junior {{with the assistance}} of Kurt Bardi-Barry, a wealthy owner of a travel agency and one of Austria's leading drivers at the time; Barry gave him his one-year-old Cooper T67 and the two men formed a partnership, driving to races together. Rindt was fastest in practice for his first race in Vallelunga, a race won by Barry, and took victory in his second at Cesenatico. In the race, Rindt had taken advantage of an accident in the early stages. While most drivers slowed for the incoming ambulance, he raced ahead between the straw <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> the parked medical vehicle to take the lead. At the time, he was notorious for his dangerous style, almost crashing into the spectators at a race in the streets of Budapest.|$|E
50|$|Their {{goals are}} the {{immediate}} cessation {{of the building}} of the barrier, dismantling of all parts of the <b>barrier</b> <b>and</b> its related zones already built, the return of lands confiscated for the path of the <b>barrier,</b> <b>and</b> compensation of damages and lost income due to the destruction of land and property.|$|R

40|$|TutorialThe {{increased}} use of pressurized and non-pressurized dual mechanical seals has driven more installations to {{require the use of}} <b>barrier</b> <b>and</b> buffer fluids. While some end users have viewed the selection of barrier fluids as an afterthought, their selection is a critical aspect of the seal operation and reliability. A thorough application review requires an understanding of the mechanical seal, sealing system, pump, and process. Fortunately there is a large installed base of successful installations to guide <b>barrier</b> <b>and</b> buffer fluid selections. Through the careful selection of fluids and good operating practices, <b>barrier</b> <b>and</b> buffer fluids can help provide reliable dual seal operation...|$|R
5|$|It was not {{possible}} to simply drive through the gap in the fence that existed at crossing points, as the East Germans installed high-impact vehicle <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> mobile rolling barriers that could (and did) kill drivers that attempted to ram them. Vehicles were subjected to rigorous checks to uncover fugitives. Inspection pits and mirrors allowed the undersides of vehicles to be scrutinised. Probes were used to investigate the chassis and even the fuel tank, where a fugitive might be concealed, and vehicles could be partially dismantled in on-site garages. At Marienborn there was even a mortuary garage where coffins could be checked to confirm that the occupants really were dead. Passengers were checked and often interrogated about their travel plans and reasons for travelling. The system used simple technology and was slow, relying largely on vast card indexes recording travellers' details, but it was effective nonetheless; during the 28years of operation of the Marienborn complex, no successful escapes were recorded.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{greatest}} differences between the solitary and gregarious phases is behavioural. The gregaria nymphs are attracted to each other, this being seen {{as early as the}} second instar. They soon form bands of many thousands of individuals. These groups behave like cohesive units and move across the landscape, mostly downhill, but making their way round <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> merging with other bands. The attraction between the insects seems to be largely visual, but also involves olfactory cues, and the band seem to navigate using the sun. They pause to feed at intervals before resuming their march, and may cover tens of kilometres over a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|The Cucurbita digitata, C.foetidissima, C.galeotti, and C.pedatifolia species {{groups are}} xerophytes, arid zone {{perennials}} with storage roots; the remainder, including the five domesticated species, are all mesophytic annuals or short-life perennials with no storage roots. The five domesticated species are mostly isolated {{from each other}} by sterility <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> have different physiological characteristics. Some cross pollinations can occur: C.pepo with C.argyrosperma and C.moschata; and C.maxima with C.moschata. Cross pollination does occur readily within the family Cucurbitaceae. The buffalo gourd (C.foetidissima), which does not taste good, {{has been used as}} an intermediary as it can be crossed with all the common Cucurbita.|$|E

5|$|The {{flight time}} of the adults or imagines begins {{in the late summer}} to early autumn, but the date depends on the region and climate. The males hatch out earlier than females and create swarms which gather around the treetops. The females seek out leks and couple with the males on the {{uppermost}} shoots. Then the females search for suitable host trees, if possible choosing weak and dry wood. They orient on monoterpene hydrocarbon compounds, which weakened trees produce. When a tree is stressed through dryness or exterior injuries, the compounds pervade osmotic <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> escape from the bark.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Xangsane moved over Thailand on October 2 and combined with monsoonal moisture {{over the north}} {{central part of the}} country, causing torrential rains and severe flooding in over 35 provinces. Floodwaters broke through levees and <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> flooded or damaged nearly 1.3million rai (2,100km², 520,000acres) of farmland and local infrastructure. Many municipalities reported flooding of up to three meters (10ft), and the municipality of Ang Thong reported flooding of 60cm (2ft). The Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation reported 47 deaths, and villages in several provinces reported significant levels of water pollution and waterborne illnesses from stagnant waters.|$|E
5|$|The road {{remains largely}} {{as it was}} on opening day, though the plants in its median {{have given way to}} a steel guard rail, and most {{recently}} to concrete <b>barriers,</b> <b>and</b> it now carries the designation State Route 110, not historic U.S. Route 66. Between 1954 and 2010, it was officially designated the Pasadena Freeway. In 2010, as part of plans to revitalize its scenic value and improve safety, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) restored the original name to the roadway. All the bridges built during parkway construction remain, as do four older bridges that crossed the Arroyo Seco before the 1930s. The Arroyo Seco Parkway is designated a State Scenic Highway, National Civil Engineering Landmark, and National Scenic Byway. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.|$|E

5|$|The socio-religious {{movements}} of the previous centuries, such as Lingayatism, provided momentum for flexible social norms to which women were expected to abide. By this time South Indian women had crossed most <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> were actively involved in matters hitherto considered the monopoly of men, such as administration, business and trade, and involvement in the fine arts. Tirumalamba Devi who wrote Varadambika Parinayam and Gangadevi who wrote Madhuravijayam were among the notable women poets of the era. Early Telugu women poets like Tallapaka Timmakka and Atukuri Molla became popular during this period. The court of the Nayaks of Tanjore {{is known to have}} patronised several women poets. The Devadasi system existed, as well as legalised prostitution relegated to a few streets in each city. The popularity of harems amongst men of the royalty is well known from records.|$|E

Only the western portion of the two side platforms is in use, where direct connection can be made with buses. The station is located adjacent to the shopping center at Mortensrud. The station is designed by Arkitektskap. It is built in concrete, covered in red brick, steel, natural rock and wood, that will allow lianas to grow on them. The roofover the western platform is curved, and made of wood and glass. There is an underground parking lot in two levels.|$|E

Numerous obstacles themed from the Mario series appear, such as Thwomps in the Bowser's Castle tracks, the Cheep-Cheeps from Super Mario World in Koopa Beach and pipe barriers which are found in the Mario Circuit tracks. Other features include off-road sections which slow down the karts such as the mud bogs in the Choco Island tracks. Each single player track is littered with coins and power up tiles, as well as turbo tiles which give the karts a boost of speed and jumps which launch the karts into the air.|$|E
