50|$|These {{bars are}} solid steel bars {{intended}} for professional use. They have commonly an exchangeable nose since the sprocket at the <b>bar</b> <b>nose</b> wears out {{faster than the}} bar.|$|E
50|$|When {{turning the}} screw, a hook {{in a bar}} hole moves the bar either out (tensioning) or in, making the chain loose. Tension is right when it can be moved easily by hand and not hanging loose from the bar. When tensioning, hold the <b>bar</b> <b>nose</b> up and pull the bar nuts tight. Otherwise the chain might derail.|$|E
30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the log {{preheating}} and peeling settings in this study were optimised for radiata pine. Acevedo et al. (2012) reported that better quality veneers were obtained from E. nitens by adjusting <b>nose</b> <b>bar</b> pressure and peeling knife angle.|$|R
50|$|The nasal helmet was a type {{of combat}} helmet characterised by the {{possession}} of a projecting <b>bar</b> covering the <b>nose</b> and thus protecting {{the centre of the}} face; it was of Western European origins and was used from the Early Middle Ages until the High Middle Ages.|$|R
6000|$|Mulcachy cursed. [...] "Here's where hell coughs," [...] he said. The nooses were {{introduced}} again. Again St. Elias, helpless {{on his side}} against and partly through the <b>bars,</b> had his <b>nose</b> punched. This time {{it was the other}} nostril. And hell coughed. As before, the moment he was released, he tore the ring out through his flesh.|$|R
50|$|The oil {{is pumped}} {{from a small}} pump to {{a hole in the}} bar. From here the lower ends of each chain drive link take a portion of the oil into the gauge towards the <b>bar</b> <b>nose.</b> Pump outlet and bar hole must be aligned. Since the bar is moving out and inwards {{depending}} on the chain length, the oil outlet on the saw side has a banana style long shape.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 34 {{species of fish}} {{are found in the}} river including; the Glassfish, <b>Barred</b> Grunter, Sonub <b>nosed</b> Garfish, Milkfish, Fly-specked Hardyhead, Treadfin Silver Biddy, Flathead Goby, Spangled Perch, Barramundi, Oxeye Herring, Rainbowfish, Black-banded Rainbowfish, Northern Trout Gudgeon, Bony Bream, Catfish, Spotted Scat, Hyrtl's Tandan, Freshwater Longtom, Seven-spot Archerfish and the Giant Gudgeon. The {{endangered}} Gulf snapping turtle has been found in {{the upper reaches of the}} river.|$|R
5000|$|The song [...] "Come Again" [...] {{refers to}} the social {{pressure}} to [...] "achieve orgasmic equality"; a 1982 profile in Mother Jones notes that the song depicts sex [...] "as a dreary ritual in which partners as joyless as lab rats press <b>bars</b> and <b>nose</b> buttons {{in the hopes of}} an orgasm as dry and quantifiable as kibble." [...] The song, directed at [...] "those who changed the game" [...] and [...] "brought in new rules", asks [...] "is it real? Are you feeling it?", before turning into a dialogue between the female lead singer and male back up who is evidently attempting to satisfy her: [...] "Am I doing it right?" [...] he asks, and the woman reassures him, [...] "You're not selfish/You're trying hard to please me - please, please me/Is your finger aching?/I can feel you hesitating." [...] The song was banned from the BBC, who feared parental backlash.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} bolted-together aluminium tubing, with its 75% double surface wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. The 33.4 ft span wing {{is supported by a}} single tube-type kingpost, uses an [...] "A" [...] frame weight-shift control <b>bar,</b> has a <b>nose</b> angle of 121°, 24 top and six bottom battens and has a wing area of 161 sq ft. The acceptable power range is [...] and the standard powerplants used include the twin cylinder, liquid-cooled, two-stroke [...] Rotax 462 snowmobile engine, the twin cylinder, air-cooled, two-stroke [...] Rotax 503 aircraft engine and the twin cylinder, liquid-cooled, two-stroke, dual-ignition [...] Rotax 582 powerplant. The BMW R100RS four-stroke motorcycle engine can also be fitted.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, {{the alien}} child inside Cat claws its way out; {{on board the}} alien ship, Foxy is {{impregnated}} with another alien fetus while Gavin loses his virginity to a shapely female alien; Bruce, Candy, and the Welsh brothers meet various horrible demises; Ricky blows up himself and four alien pursuers in a tank of liquid manure; back at the house, the female alien rips Foxy in half; and finally Gavin manages to use his laptop (in a sequence reminiscent of Independence Day) to overload the ley lines of the nearby stone circle. As Cat's alien child rips his arms off, Gavin manages to press the space <b>bar</b> with his <b>nose,</b> sending the stones shooting into {{the underside of the}} alien craft, which crashes into a convenient mountain. Jack the sound man, meanwhile, having been blinded by alien ichor early in the film, swims across the channel to the mainland, only to discover that he's lost the videotape that was the only proof of their extraterrestrial encounter.|$|R
5000|$|After Neo knocks Smith {{into the}} crater {{in the level}} [...] "Aerial Battle", Smith is sent flying through the ground and up through the street. As Neo relaxes, the {{surrounding}} Smiths {{walk away from the}} crater. Neo gets out of the crater, and dodges a car which flies through the air and lands in a pile of debris. Neo looks on as Smiths tear up chunks of the road and throw cars into this pile. A truck then speeds into a building and blows it up. Smiths can be seen holding the debris together as it takes on a thirty-story tall humanoid form which is then struck by lightning, powering it up. Neo flies up to watch as the giant humanoid lowers its head onto its shoulders. The giant Smith then pulls a pair of giant Smith Shades from a billboard and puts them on. As an interesting aside, the glasses on the billboard are the same ones Agent Smith wore in the first Matrix film, with the curved <b>nose</b> <b>bar,</b> but when the MegaSmith actually puts them on, they become the ones Agent Smith wears in The Matrix Reloaded and in Revolutions.|$|R
40|$|The 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) lesion is {{the most}} widely used rat model of Parkinson's disease. A single {{unilateral}} injection of 6 -OHDA into the median forebrain bundle (MFB) selectively destroys dopamine neurons in the ipsilateral substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA), removing more than 95 % of the dopamine innervation from target areas. The stereotaxic coordinates used to deliver 6 -OHDA to the MFB have been used in our laboratory successfully for more than 25 years. However, in recent years we have observed a decline in the success rate of this lesion. Previously regular success rates of > 80 % of rats lesioned, have become progressively more variable, with rates as low as 20 % recorded in some experiments. Having excluded variability of the neurotoxin and operator errors, we hypothesized that the change seen might be due to the use of smaller rats at the time of first surgery. An attempt to proportionally adjust the lesion coordinates base on head size did not increase lesion efficacy. However, in support of the small rat hypothesis it was observed that, using the standard coordinates, rat's heads had a “nose-up” position in the stereotaxic fame. Adjustment of the <b>nose</b> <b>bar</b> to obtain a flat head position during surgery improved lesion success, and subsequent adjustments of the lesion coordinates to account for smaller head size led to a greatly increased lesion efficacy (> 90 %) as assessed by amphetamine induced rotation...|$|R
50|$|Conventional tugs use a tow bar {{to connect}} the tug to the nose landing gear of the aircraft. The tow bar is fixed {{laterally}} at the nose landing gear, but may move slightly vertically for height adjustment. At the end that attaches to the tug, the tow bar may pivot freely laterally and vertically. In this manner the tow bar acts as a large lever to rotate the nose landing gear. Each aircraft type has a unique tow fitting so the towbar also acts as an adapter between the standard-sized tow pin on the tug and the type-specific fitting on the aircraft's landing gear. The tow bar must be long enough to place the tug far away enough to avoid hitting the aircraft and to provide sufficient leverage to facilitate turns. On heavy tow bars for large aircraft the towbar rides on its own wheels when not connected to an aircraft. The wheels are attached to a hydraulic jacking mechanism which can lift the towbar to the correct height to mate to both the airplane and the tug, and once this is accomplished the same mechanism is used in reverse to raise the tow bar wheels from the ground during the pushback process. The tow bar can be connected at the front or {{the rear of the}} tractor, depending on whether the aircraft will be pushed or pulled. The towbar has a shear pin which prevents the aircraft from being mishandled by the tug; when overstressed the shear pin will snap, disconnecting the <b>bar</b> from the <b>nose</b> gear to prevent damage to the aircraft and tug.Towbarless tractors do not use a towbar; they scoop up the nose landing gear and lift it off the ground, allowing the tug to maneuver the aircraft. This allows better control of the aircraft and higher speeds; it may also eliminate the need to have a worker in the cockpit to apply the aircraft's brakes. The main advantage of a towbarless tug is simplicity; {{there is no need to}} maintain multiple towbars. The physical action and coordination required by the tug operator to move an aircraft with a TBL tug is simpler and easier to learn than with a tug and towbar. By connecting the tug directly to the aircraft's landing gear tug operators have better control and responsiveness when maneuvering. This is most advantageous in general aviation settings where operators are often required to move more types of aircraft more often into more confined spaces than their airline counterparts.|$|R
