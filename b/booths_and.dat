5|$|The {{project will}} involve {{building}} a high-speed interchange {{between the two}} roadways. The turnpike commission will also widen the existing four-lane road to six lanes east of the Bensalem interchange, build a new facility east of the Street Road interchange at Neshaminy Falls to mark {{the eastern end of}} the ticket system that will consist of high-speed E-ZPass lanes along with ticket and cash <b>booths,</b> <b>and</b> convert the present Delaware River Bridge toll barrier to a westbound all-electronic facility. A second parallel bridge will also be built over the Delaware River. Work on the project began in late 2010; the replacement of two bridges over the tollway was completed in 2011. Groundbreaking for the interchange with I-95 took place on July 30, 2013, with Governor Corbett in attendance. Construction of the first stage of the interchange began in fall 2014. The flyover ramps between northbound I-95 and the eastbound turnpike, and between the westbound turnpike and southbound I-95 are due to be completed by 2018. Work on the new mainline toll plaza and widening of the turnpike between I-95 and the Delaware River also began in 2013, with completion in 2016. In 2020, construction is expected to begin on completion of the movements between the tollway and I-95, along with the widening of the turnpike between the Bensalem interchange and I-95. Work on building a second, parallel span of the Delaware River Bridge is planned to begin in 2025. The first stage of the project, which includes the new toll plaza, widening, and the flyover ramps between I-95 and the turnpike, is to cost $420 million. The flyover ramps are expected to cost $142.9 million, with $100 million coming from federal funds and the remainder from the turnpike commission. The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission is borrowing money from foreign investors in order to provide funding for the project. The remaining stages of the project are unfunded, with a projected total cost of $1.1 billion for the entire project.|$|E

5000|$|During {{his study}} of <b>Booth</b> <b>and</b> Brennan, Sweets began {{to write a book}} about them. In the episode [...] "Mayhem on a Cross", Dr. Sweets {{received}} a review by Dr. Gordon Wyatt of his book on the relationship between <b>Booth</b> <b>and</b> Brennan. Dr. Wyatt explained that he felt Sweets had misinterpreted the relationship between <b>Booth</b> <b>and</b> Brennan by looking on a somewhat superficial level. The work primarily focused how <b>Booth</b> <b>and</b> Brennan are opposites and that their sexual attraction is limited because their primary responsibility is to their careers. Dr. Wyatt explains he feels <b>Booth</b> <b>and</b> Brennan are much more similar than Sweets understands and that one of the two is, in fact, aware of the underlying sexual tension between them and struggles with it daily. After learning about <b>Booth</b> <b>and</b> Brennan's backgrounds, he concludes that Sweets' [...] "near obsession" [...] with them and writing the book was a way of finding his place in the world and that he has created his emotional connection with them as a way of finding a family, something Brennan compares to [...] "imprinting" [...] like a baby duck. It is revealed in [...] "The Dwarf in the Dirt" [...] that Sweets has not published his book, because he fears how <b>Booth</b> <b>and</b> Brennan would respond to the book's conclusion that they are in love with each other. He asks Wyatt, now a chef, if he has the right to publish his book when <b>Booth</b> <b>and</b> Brennan can't even admit to themselves that they're in love, but Wyatt tells him he left psychiatry so he wouldn't have to deal with a dilemma like that.|$|R
