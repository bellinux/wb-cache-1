5|$|Unlike most animals, {{porpoises}} are conscious breathers. All mammals sleep, but porpoises cannot {{afford to}} become unconscious for long <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> drown. While knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited, porpoises in captivity {{have been recorded}} to sleep with one side of their brain at a time, {{so that they may}} swim, breathe consciously, and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most animals, {{whales are}} {{conscious}} breathers. All mammals sleep, but whales cannot afford to become unconscious for long <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> drown. They {{are believed to}} exhibit unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, in which they sleep {{with half of the}} brain while the other half remains active. This behavior was only documented in toothed whales until footage of a humpback whale sleeping (vertically) was shot in 2014.|$|E

5|$|On a computer, if {{the result}} of an {{addition}} is too large to store, an arithmetic overflow occurs, resulting in an incorrect answer. Unanticipated arithmetic overflow is a fairly common cause of program errors. Such overflow bugs may be hard to discover and diagnose <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> manifest themselves only for very large input data sets, which {{are less likely to be}} used in validation tests. One especially notable such error was the Y2K bug, where overflow errors due to using a 2-digit format for years caused significant computer problems in 2000.|$|E
5|$|On {{the inner}} {{surface of the}} nasal section of skull are ridges called nasoturbinals, which may have {{supported}} cartilage that increased {{the area of the}} olfactory epithelium, the layer of tissue that detects odors. These ridges are much smaller than those of later synapsids from the Late Permian and Triassic, whose large nasoturbinals are taken as evidence for warm-bloodedness <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have supported mucous membranes that warmed and moistened incoming air. Thus, the nasal cavity of Dimetrodon is transitional between those of early land vertebrates and mammals.|$|E
5|$|Pharmacologically active plant {{extracts}} {{can interact}} with conventional drugs, both <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> provide an increased dose of similar compounds, and because some phytochemicals {{interfere with the}} body's systems that metabolise drugs in the liver including the cytochrome P450 system, making the drugs last longer {{in the body and}} have a more powerful cumulative effect. Plant medicines can be dangerous during pregnancy. Since plants may contain many different substances, plant extracts may have complex effects on the human body.|$|E
50|$|Abstention in {{compulsory}} voting systems {{tends to be}} somewhat ineffective, as the protest 'message' {{is likely to be}} confused with apathy. Voters who do not care who is elected, but are simply voting <b>because</b> <b>they</b> must, <b>may</b> choose to abstain, and the abstention protest votes will be confused with the apathetic abstention votes.|$|R

Nay, I often find bits of things in my way, that the poor bodies, God help them! leave there, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> think <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be useful to me.

50|$|Some {{critics of}} {{immigration}} {{argue that the}} presence of immigrants may distort the national identity of the native population. That means that the native population opposes immigration <b>because</b> <b>they</b> fear <b>they</b> <b>may</b> lose their sense of belonging to their own nation, as represented by distinctive traditions, culture, language and politics.|$|R
5|$|As a term, neo {{soul was}} coined by Kedar Massenburg of Motown Records {{in the late}} 1990s as a {{marketing}} category following the commercial breakthroughs of artists such as D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. The success of D'Angelo's 1995 debut album Brown Sugar has been regarded by several writers and music critics as inspiration behind the term's origin. While some artists have ignored the label, others have received the designation with controversy because it may seem contrived to music audiences and imply that soul music had ended {{at some point in}} time. In a 2002 interview for Billboard, Massenburg said that genre classifications are often unpopular <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be suggestive of a short-lived trend. However, although he said neo soul is still essentially soul music, Massenburg felt there was a need to market artists of the genre for listeners to have an understanding of what they were buying.|$|E
5|$|At Lebec, California, {{just south}} of the {{epicenter}} of the July mainshock, the San Andreas Fault comes together with the Garlock Fault, which is positioned at the northern border of the Mojave Desert. The San Andreas has been responsible for considerable seismic activity at its northern and southern sections, and traverses the area near the Transverse Ranges. The Kern Canyon Fault mirrors the path of the Kern River, and was thought to have a connection with the White Wolf Fault, but indicators observed following the July 21 earthquake demonstrated that the two are offset. The Owens Valley Fault, {{on the east side of}} the Sierran block, has been mapped and may possibly extend into area that was affected by the 1952 shocks. Other fault zones are present in the region, and have been of interest <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have been responsible for minor earthquakes, but they are considered not as significant as the Kern Canyon, Owens Valley, and San Andreas Faults.|$|E
5|$|Perforator veins play a {{very special}} role in the venous system, {{carrying}} blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as important <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent perforators, which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the Paran√° maneuver, toe and foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E
40|$|Deterministic {{recursive}} algorithms for the computation of matrix triangular decompositions with permutations like LU and Bruhat decomposition {{are presented}} {{for the case}} of commutative domains. This decomposition {{can be considered as}} a generalization of LU and Bruhat decompositions, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> both <b>may</b> be easily obtained from this triangular decomposition. Algorithms have the same complexity as the algorithm of matrix multiplication...|$|R

50|$|It {{is a kind}} of loan, or contract, {{with one}} difference: the commodate is , and does not {{transfer}} the property; the thing must be returned in essence, and without deterioration, so that things which consume by use, or time, cannot be objects of a commodate, but of a loan, <b>because</b> although <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be returned in kind, they cannot in identity.|$|R
5|$|Fomepizole is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of alcohol dehydrogenase; similar to ethanol, it acts to block {{the formation of the}} toxic metabolites. Fomepizole {{has been shown to be}} highly effective as an antidote for ethylene glycol poisoning. It is the only antidote approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning. Both antidotes have advantages and disadvantages. Ethanol is readily available in most hospitals, is inexpensive, and can be administered orally as well as intravenously. Its adverse effects include intoxication, hypoglycemia in children, and possible liver toxicity. Patients receiving ethanol therapy also require frequent blood ethanol concentration measurements and dosage adjustments to maintain a therapeutic ethanol concentration. Patients therefore must be monitored in an intensive care unit. Alternatively, the adverse side effects of fomepizole are minimal and the approved dosing regimen maintains therapeutic concentrations without the need to monitor blood concentrations of the drug. The disadvantage of fomepizole is that it is expensive. Costing US$1,000 per gram, an average course used in an adult poisoning would cost approximately $3,500 to $4,000. Despite the cost, fomepizole is gradually replacing ethanol as the antidote of choice in ethylene glycol poisoning. Adjunct agents including thiamine and pyridoxine are often given, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> help prevent the formation of oxalic acid. The use of these agents is based on theoretical observations and there is limited evidence to support their use in treatment; they may be of particular benefit in people who could be deficient in these vitamins such as malnourished or alcoholic patients.|$|E
5|$|Like all cats, the jaguar is an obligate carnivore, feeding only on meat. It is an {{opportunistic}} {{hunter and}} its diet encompasses at least 87 species. The jaguar can take virtually any terrestrial or riparian vertebrate found in Central or South America, with {{a preference for}} large prey. The jaguar {{is more of a}} dietary generalist than its Old World cousins: the American tropics have a high diversity of small animals but relatively low populations and diversity of the large ungulates which this genus favors. They regularly take adult caimans, deer, capybaras, tapirs, peccaries, dogs, zorros, and sometimes even anacondas. However, the cat will eat any small species that can be caught, including frogs, mice, birds (mainly ground-based species such as cracids), fish, sloths, monkeys, and turtles; a study conducted in Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize, for example, revealed that the diets of jaguars there consisted primarily of armadillos and pacas. Some jaguars will also take domestic livestock. El Jefe, the only jaguar currently living within the territory of the United States, has also been found to kill and eat American black bears, as deduced from hairs found within his scats and the partly consumed carcass of a black bear sow with the distinctive puncture marks to the skull left by jaguars. This indicates that jaguars might have once preyed on black bears when the species was still present in the area. Spectacled bears are also known to avoid jaguars, possibly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> constitute occasional prey items.|$|E

At last she forswears love entirely, being convinced that her destiny is to remain single.|$|R
50|$|Defendants {{who choose}} to appear pro se <b>may</b> do so <b>because</b> <b>they</b> believe <b>they</b> <b>may</b> gain {{tactical}} advantages against the prosecutor, such as obtaining sympathy from the jury, the opportunity to personally address the jury and witnesses. Pro se appearances may also delay the trial proceedings and enhance {{the possibility of a}} mistrial and a subsequent appeal.|$|R
25|$|However, one can {{determine}} if two manifolds are different {{if there is}} some intrinsic characteristic that differentiates them. Such criteria are commonly referred to as invariants, <b>because,</b> while <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be defined in terms of some presentation (such as the genus in terms of a triangulation), they are the same relative to all possible descriptions of a particular manifold: they are invariant under different descriptions.|$|R
25|$|Portfolio diversification: Depending on the securitization, {{hedge funds}} {{as well as}} other {{institutional}} investors tend to like investing in bonds created through securitizations <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be uncorrelated to their other bonds and securities.|$|E
25|$|The median {{can be used}} as {{a measure}} of {{location}} when a distribution is skewed, when end-values are not known, or when one requires reduced importance to be attached to outliers, e.g., <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be measurement errors.|$|E
25|$|Antimicrobials {{that reduce}} the number of the strict {{anaerobic}} component of the gut flora (i.e., metronidazole) generally should not be given <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> enhance systemic infection by aerobic or facultative bacteria, thus facilitating mortality after irradiation.|$|E
50|$|Ms Johnston {{was made}} {{redundant}} when her fixed term contract was not renewed. Women were prohibited from carrying firearms. But many police duties involved carrying firearms. The Royal Ulster Constabulary argued the ban was justified <b>because</b> (1) <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be more frequent assassination targets (2) their guns could end in enemy hands (3) {{the public would}} object to it (4) it would hinder their jobs in social, family and children related work.|$|R
5|$|Moreover, goalkeepers {{should have}} leadership.

50|$|In {{circumstances}} {{where the child}} is in danger for other reasons, avoiding strangers (who might help) could in fact be dangerous itself, {{such as in the}} case of an 11-year-old Boy Scout who avoided rescue searchers <b>because</b> he feared <b>they</b> <b>may</b> want to 'steal him'.|$|R
25|$|Outliers, {{being the}} most extreme observations, may include the sample maximum or sample minimum, or both, {{depending}} on whether they are extremely high or low. However, the sample maximum and minimum are not always outliers <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not be unusually far from other observations.|$|E
25|$|Tetracycline use {{should be}} avoided in {{pregnant}} or lactating women, and in children with developing teeth <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> result in permanent staining (dark yellow-gray teeth with a darker horizontal band that goes across {{the top and bottom}} rows of teeth), and possibly affect the growth of teeth and bones.|$|E
