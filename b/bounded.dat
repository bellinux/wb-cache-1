40|$|Abstract. Karchmer, Kushilevitz and Nisan {{formulated}} {{the formula}} size problem as an integer programming problem called the rectangle <b>bound</b> and introduced {{a technique called}} the LP <b>bound,</b> which gives a formula size lower <b>bound</b> by showing a feasible solution of the dual problem of its LP-relaxation. As extensions of the LP <b>bound,</b> we introduce novel general techniques proving formula size lower <b>bounds,</b> named a quasi-additive <b>bound</b> and the Sherali-Adams <b>bound.</b> While the Sherali-Adams <b>bound</b> is potentially strong enough to give a lower <b>bound</b> matching to the rectangle <b>bound,</b> we prove that the quasi-additive <b>bound</b> can surpass the rectangle <b>bound.</b> ...|$|R

In this paper, {{we are interested in}} the Bayesian <b>bound</b> of the Weiss–Weinstein family. Among this family, we have Bayesian Cramér-Rao <b>bound,</b> the Bobrovsky–MayerWolf–Zakaï <b>bound,</b> the Bayesian Bhattacharyya <b>bound,</b> the Bobrovsky–Zakaï <b>bound,</b> the Reuven–Messer <b>bound,</b> and the Weiss–Weinstein <b>bound.</b> We present a unification of all these minimal <b>bounds</b> based on a rewriting of the minimum {{mean square error}} estimator (MMSEE) and on a constrained optimization problem. With this approach, we obtain a useful theoretical framework to derive new Bayesian <b>bounds.</b> For that purpose, we propose two <b>bounds.</b> First, we propose a generalization of the Bayesian Bhattacharyya <b>bound</b> extending the works of Bobrovsky, Mayer–Wolf, and Zakaï. Second, we propose a <b>bound</b> based on the Bayesian Bhattacharyya <b>bound</b> and on the Reuven–Messer <b>bound,</b> representing a generalization of these <b>bounds.</b> The proposed <b>bound</b> is the Bayesian extension of the deterministic Abel <b>bound</b> and is found to be tighter than the Bayesian Bhattacharyya <b>bound,</b> the Reuven–Messer <b>bound,</b> the Bobrovsky–Zakaï <b>bound,</b> and the Bayesian Cramér–Rao <b>bound.</b> We propose some closed-form expressions of these <b>bounds</b> for a general Gaussian observation model with parameterized mean.
