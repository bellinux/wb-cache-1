5|$|In 1937, Wigan was {{prominently}} {{featured in}} George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier which dealt, in large part, {{with the living}} conditions of England's working poor. Some have embraced the Orwellian link, as it has provided the area with a modest tourist base over the years. Others regard this connection as disappointing, considering it an insinuation that Wigan is no <b>better</b> <b>now</b> <b>than</b> {{it was at the}} time of Orwell's writing.|$|E
500|$|Raonic {{reached the}} final of the Brisbane International against world No. 3 Federer in a rematch of their 2015 final. This time, Raonic upset Federer in {{straight}} sets, winning his eighth career title. Asked to talk about Raonic after the match, Federer observed: [...] "or a big guy he moves well ... He's improved his fitness the last few years. Also, tactically, I think he's <b>better</b> <b>now</b> <b>than</b> he's ever been. He's made a conscious effort of playing close to the baseline, which before when he was working with the Spanish coaches he was way back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{long-term}} malaise {{of the board}} wargaming industry, it does continue and {{shows no sign of}} shutting down completely in the foreseeable future. [...] It can even be argued that the hobby is doing <b>better</b> <b>now</b> <b>than</b> for the past two decades.|$|E

2500|$|Geronimo's {{participation}} in the [...] "What Love Is..." [...] with Martin Nievera concert was described by Baby A. Gil of the Philippine Star with the comment, [...] "Who needs a dancing Martin anyway {{when you have the}} long-limbed Sarah there, who is a daring, enthusiastic dancer? I like watching her dance and finding her moving even <b>better</b> <b>now</b> <b>than</b> the last time is a treat. Of course, she has also become an even better singer. To those who are wont to ask, has she gotten rid of her Celine Dion tendencies? Well, she still sings a good To Love You More, but she has obviously come to her own with fuller tones, nice, sexy low notes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to Rasmussen's exit, the doping {{revelations of}} Sinkewitz and Vinokourov had been met with {{defiance}} by the UCI, the Tour organizers {{and the majority}} of the European press (with certain exceptions) however, with Rasmussen's sacking whilst wearing the yellow jersey (no rider had previously been withdrawn from the race while leading), the mood became more pessimistic, with the exception of Tour director Christian Prudhomme who publicly regarded the Dane's withdrawal as [...] "the best thing that can happen to the Tour. The race will go on {{for the rest of the}} riders and we believe it would be an insult to them to stop the race. We believe the general classification is much <b>better</b> <b>now</b> <b>than</b> it was." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 4 August 2012, Commons {{scored the}} only {{goal of the}} game as Celtic beat Aberdeen 1–0 in the opening game of the 2012–13 league season. In Celtic's next league game on 18 August, Commons scored a last-minute {{equaliser}} to clinch a 1–1 draw against Ross County. On 21 August, Commons scored the opening goal in a 2–0 win against Helsingborgs in the Champions League play-off round first leg. [...] Commons had now regained the form he had shown when he first joined Celtic in 2011. [...] Manager Neil Lennon commented [...] "Last season, Kris was curtailed by injuries and self-doubt, for whatever reason, I don't know.", but added regarding his current performances, [...] "I think he is playing even <b>better</b> <b>now</b> <b>than</b> {{he was in his}} first season." [...] On 5 December, Commons scored the winning goal against Spartak Moscow from the penalty spot at Celtic Park, sending Celtic through to the last 16 of the Champions League {{for the first time in}} five years. [...] On 16 March 2013 in the 4–3 home win over Aberdeen, Commons broke the record for the fastest goal in the SPL with a time of 12.2 seconds; a record previously held by Celtic teammate Anthony Stokes. [...] Commons finished the season with both a League Championship winner's medal and a Scottish Cup winner's medal as Celtic completed a league and cup double.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} tour, the itinerary was expanded from the initial 12 dates to an eventual 21 dates running from 10 November in Frome until 16 December in Norwich, (with a non-tour acoustic gig at a benefit event for London's Wilton Hall venue thrown in for good measure). Likewise as {{with the previous}} tour, Ant completed the entire schedule and to further hugely positive reviews. [...] The Irish Evening Herald praised his concert of 25 November at Dublin's Vicar Street venue: [...] "He ain't like other performers, this guy. One drum kit could never be {{good enough for the}} likes of Stuart Leslie Goddard ... Plastic Surgery? A terrific opener. Stand and Deliver? Even <b>better</b> <b>now</b> <b>than</b> it was then. Prince Charming? Terrific, as always. And hey, that Marc Bolan tribute at the end more than sealed the deal ... {{there was no time for}} chit chat. [...] Which, incidentally, pretty much sums up Adam's live performance these days: no chit chat and no messing about. A straight-up display of raw, often deafening post-punk, Adam's way of keeping the crowd happy is to play as many tunes as possible. [...] He's well aware of what the people came to hear, so he gives it to them. Better still, his voice remains in fine shape. Oh, and as for the 'Posse'? Let's just say that 'The Good, The Mad and The Lovely' is a more than suitable moniker.". The Southern Daily Echo heaped similar adulation upon the concert of 18 November 2011 at Eastleigh's Concorde Club: [...] "Adam Ant, along with his backing band of The Good, the Mad and the Lovely possee, showed he can still rock, even in his mid-50s now. We wanted to hear the greatest hits, and Adam duly delivered ... The crowd lapped it all up ... It was a brilliant evening." ...|$|E

5000|$|Jason Scales of Illinois Entertainer added, 'Political-social {{commentary}} and a firm {{belief in the}} power of positive thinking punctuate Marcus Singletary’s Capitol Hill. Dreamy, jam-based blues largely carries the message, including this line from 'Super Tuesday': 'Are you <b>better</b> off <b>now</b> <b>than</b> you were four years ago? / It's time for a change.' [...] The 2006 compilation Rocks documented highlights from these recordings as a 'sampling of Singletary's recorded blues resume.' ...|$|R

5000|$|On 5 December, Jaguar {{announced}} Steiner {{had been}} replaced by project manager David Pitchforth as part of the restructuring.

6000|$|... "Josie O'Gorman," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, meditatively, [...] "is a wonderfully clever girl. I believe she is <b>better,</b> even <b>now,</b> <b>than</b> {{a score of}} average male sleuths. Perhaps {{it will be a}} {{desirable}} thing for her to come here, for she will be shrewd enough to decide, in a short time, whether or not your suspicions are justified.
