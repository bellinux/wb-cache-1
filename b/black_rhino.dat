5|$|Spotted hyenas {{have also}} been found to catch fish, tortoises, humans, <b>black</b> <b>rhino,</b> hippo calves, young African elephants, {{pangolins}} and pythons. There {{is at least one}} record of four hyenas killing an adult or subadult hippopotamus in Kruger National Park. The fossil record indicates that the now extinct European spotted hyenas primarily fed on Przewalski's horses, Irish elk, reindeer, red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, wild boar, ibex, steppe wisent, aurochs, and woolly rhinoceros. Spotted hyenas are thought to be responsible for the dis-articulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for hyenas, especially at the end of winter, when food was scarce. Spotted hyenas may consume leather articles such as boots and belts around campsites. Jane Goodall recorded spotted hyenas attacking or savagely playing with the exterior and interior fittings of cars, and the species is thought to be responsible for eating car tyres.|$|E

50|$|On 17 May 1971 {{the first}} two <b>black</b> <b>rhinos</b> were reintroduced to the park since their kind became extinct in the 1940s. In 1972, a further 30 <b>black</b> <b>rhinos</b> were sent from Natal and Rhodesia.|$|R
40|$|Tanzania {{had many}} <b>black</b> <b>rhinos</b> (Diceros bicornis) in the 1960 s but {{was hit by}} {{ruthless}} poaching between the 1970 s and late 1980 s. From the 1990 s, the country declared a war against unscrupulous poachers in order to conserve the few remaining rhinos. The current strategy is to reintroduce <b>black</b> <b>rhinos</b> that were originally from East Africa {{in order to increase}} genetic diversity. Three translocations of <b>black</b> <b>rhinos</b> between 1997 and 2001 involved 10 animals from South Africa, two of which were reintroduced to Ngorongoro Crater and eight to Mkomazi National Park. In 2007, two <b>black</b> <b>rhinos</b> from Port Lympne Wild Animal Park, UK, were introduced into a sanctuary adjacent to Ikorongo-Grumeti Game Reserves. In June 2009, three <b>black</b> <b>rhinos</b> from the Czech Republic were translocated to Mkomazi National Park. Another translocation operation is expected to begin in May 2010 whereby 32 <b>black</b> <b>rhinos</b> will be translocated into the Serengeti ecosystem from Thaba Tholo, Thabazimbi, South Africa. Although the first five translocation operations went well, the challenge is the management of the reintroduced rhinos amid the growing social-ecological pressures affecting protected areas. Management authorities should consider the recommended sex ratio for rhino populations to avoid excessive male aggression...|$|R
50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>Rhinos</b> {{were founded}} in 1983 after {{splitting}} from Highlanders. In 1983, the club won promotion {{into the top}} division after losing just once in the entire Northern Region Division One season. After promotion, <b>Black</b> <b>Rhinos</b> claimed the domestic double in the following season when they won the Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League and Cup of Zimbabwe double in 1984. The previous season's success saw <b>Black</b> <b>Rhinos</b> enter continental competition {{for the first time}} in 1985 when they participated in the African Cup of Champions Clubs. Despite beating Mbabane Highlanders and Power Dynamos they went onto lose 2-3 on aggregate to Gor√©e. 1985 and 1986 were less successful for <b>Black</b> <b>Rhinos</b> as they failed to finish inside the top three in either season, but things improved in 1987 when the club won their second league title after finishing above Dynamos.|$|R

50|$|Wildlife in {{the park}} includes: <b>black</b> <b>rhino,</b> buffalo, giraffe, blue {{wildebeest}} and various species of antelope. The park is of special importance to the <b>black</b> <b>rhino</b> as {{it is part of}} the animal's historic range, which was lost to human encroachment. With the reintroduction of the <b>black</b> <b>rhino</b> into the park and a fencing of the area, over 20,000 hectares of land has been made available for the rhinos again.|$|E
50|$|The Mid West Rhinos {{maintain}} {{close links}} with the Midlands <b>Black</b> <b>Rhino</b> Conservancy.

50|$|The western <b>black</b> <b>rhino</b> emerged about 7 to 8 {{million years}} ago. It was a sub-species of the <b>black</b> <b>rhino.</b> For {{much of the}} 1900s, its {{population}} was the highest {{out of all the}} rhino species at almost 850,000 individuals. There was a 96% population decline in black rhinos, including the western <b>black</b> <b>rhino,</b> between 1970 and 1992. Widespread poaching is concluded to be partly responsible for bringing the species close to extinction, along with farmers killing rhinos to defend their crops in areas close to rhino territories, and trophy hunting.|$|E
50|$|The south-central black {{rhinoceros}} (Diceros bicornis minor) is a subspecies of the {{black rhinoceros}}. Although {{it was the most}} numerous of the <b>black</b> <b>rhino</b> subspecies it is still listed as critically endangered by the IUCN red list. Like other <b>Black</b> <b>Rhino</b> subspecies it has a prehensile lip and lives in savanna habitat.|$|E
50|$|The eastern <b>black</b> <b>rhino</b> is {{distinguishable}} {{from the}} southern subspecies as it has a longer, leaner, and more curved horn. Its skin is also very grooved. Diceros bicornis michaeli is also reportedly more aggressive than the other three subspecies of <b>black</b> <b>rhino.</b> They are browsers and are usually found in highland forest and savanna habitat.|$|E

50|$|As {{with many}} other {{components}} of the African large mammal fauna, <b>black</b> <b>rhinos</b> probably had a wider range {{in the northern part}} of the continent in prehistoric times than today. However this seems to have not been as extensive as that of the white rhino. Unquestionable fossil remains have not yet been found in this area and the abundant petroglyphs found across the Sahara desert are often too schematic to unambiguously decide whether they depict <b>black</b> or white <b>rhinos.</b> Petroglyphs from the Eastern Desert of southeastern Egypt relatively convincingly show the occurrence of <b>black</b> <b>rhinos</b> in these areas in prehistoric times.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} {{black rhinoceros}} is a subspecies of <b>black</b> <b>rhino.</b> Another subspecies, the western <b>black</b> <b>rhino,</b> was declared extinct in 2011.
