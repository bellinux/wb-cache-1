5|$|For many years, Adrian <b>Boult</b> {{had been}} {{a close friend of}} Wilson and his first wife Ann, née Bowles.

The stigma attached to divorce in Britain in the 1930s affected Wilson's career: he was barred from performing in English cathedrals at the Three Choirs Festival for 25 years until 1957, when he narrated Honegger's King David in Worcester, by which time his singing career had ended.|$|E
